    "body": "\nA divisional battle takes place on 'Thursday Night Football' as the Seattle Seahawks host the Los Angeles Rams at 8:15 p.m. ET. Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) missed practice on Monday and Tuesday. With Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Puka Nacua ranking first and second, respectively, in receiving yards, NFL DFS stacks with their respective quarterbacks will be a popular daily Fantasy football strategy. However, Sam Darnold had four picks when these teams met in Week 11, while Matthew Stafford had just 130 passing yards. So, your NFL DFS strategy shouldn't bypass the ground games as both squads use multiple running backs.  Potential NFL DFS picks out of the backfield include Kenneth Walker III, Zach Charbonnet, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. It's all about getting the most value relative to cost when choosing options from the TNF DFS player pool. Before making any Rams vs. Seahawks DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Thursday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Seahawks vs. RamsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football' is Rams wideout Puka Nacua. Despite missing one full game, and half of another, Nacua is second in the NFL in both receptions (102) and receiving yards (1,367). The third-year receiver is coming off his best game as a pro with a career high of 181 yards on Sunday versus Detroit, which came just a week after posting a 7-167-2 stat line. Nacua had 93 total yards versus Seattle in their matchup earlier this year.. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Nacua to go Over 7.5 receptions at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Seahawks tight end AJ Barner, who was heavily featured in Week 11 versus the Rams. He had season highs in targets (11) and receptions (10), while his 70 receiving yards were one shy of matching his career high of 71. For the season, Barner has scored 5 touchdowns as part of his 43 catches and 413 receiving yards. With the Rams having a top-10 run defense, and allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns of any team, as opposed to the No. 19 pass defense, Seattle could lean on an aerial attack. That boosts Barner's value, who also scored a touchdown in his last game versus the Rams in the 2024 season. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Barner to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Rams vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

The Under is a combined 30-22 for the teams this season, with the setting also playing a factor in the model predicting under 235.5. The Under is 8-5 for the Wolves in home games this year, while the total hasn't been reached in nine of 13 road games for Memphis. Minnesota home games have also seen the Under hit in three straight entering Wednesday's contest.Over the last 13 meetings between these teams, 11 have failed to reach 235.5 points. The Grizzlies don't allow free points, as their opponents have made the fewest free throws this season, while the Wolves allow the fourth-fewest made 3-pointers per game. SportsLine's model forecasts just two players to score more than 18 points, as the teams combine for 230 points per the simulations. Thus, SportsLine's advanced model projects the Under to hit in 60% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits over 60% of the time in an A-rated pick. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. So who wins Grizzlies vs. Timberwolves, and which side of the spread hits in over 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Timberwolves vs. Grizzlies spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule rolls on with more games Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, which is the day the first round of the College Football Playoff begins. No. 8 Oklahoma is a 1-point underdog against No. 9 Alabama on Friday in the latest college football odds.Saturday is nothing but CFP action, and the latest College Football Playoff lines are No. 7 Texas A&M (-3.5) vs. No. 10 Miami, No. 6 Ole Miss (-17.5) vs. No. 11 Tulane and No. 5 Oregon (-21) vs. No. 12 James Madison, with the higher seed hosting all of those games on campus.

Both schools vastly underperformed this year but had strong finishes, with each finishing the season 3-1 ATS. However, Dabo Swinney has lost four of his last six bowl games, with each defeat coming by at least 14 points. This year, his Tigers are averaging 28.7 points, which ranks 61st in the nation, while Penn State, despite playing in the much tougher Big Ten, ranks 37th nationally in scoring. Also, the location of this game in New York City favors a northeastern university like Penn State over Clemson from South Carolina. The Nittany Lions cover almost 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-6.5, 47.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in well over 50% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

    "body": "\n        Three 2025-26 college football bowl games in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP first round as Oregon is favored by 21 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore.

Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, as Michael Van Buren Jr. will make the start. Those four TDs are the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-4.5) gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 MLB offseason is six weeks old and so far 22 of our top 50 free agents have signed and our No. 1 trade candidate has been dealt.  Spring training is two months away and there is still a lot of player  movement to come between now and then. Here now are Wednesday's hot stove  happenings.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tMariners still after Donovan, Marte  After losing Jorge Polanco to free agency, the Mariners are looking for second base help, and they're pursuing Diamondbacks star Ketel Marte and Cardinals do-it-all guy Brendan Donovan, reports The Athletic. Both Marte and Donovan were All-Stars in 2025. Donovan has recent outfield experience, which could be appealing because Seattle has several highly regarded infield prospects coming, namely Colt Emerson.  The Mariners went to Game 7 of the ALCS this past season and have one of the game's best rotations, not to mention Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodríguez in their primes. The team's World Series window is wide open. For that reason, pursuing Marte makes the most sense because he is the best player available on the trade market. He's an impact player who would meaningfully improve the team's World Series odds.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tRangers seeking rotation help  The Rangers are looking to add to their rotation, reports DLLS Sports. Texas has a strong 1-2 punch in Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi, and things really clicked for Jack Leiter in the second half this past season. Kumar Rocker and Jacob Latz are next on the rotation depth chart behind them, hence the club's interest in adding another starter.  \nIt has been a fairly busy offseason for the Rangers, who swapped Marcus Semien for Brandon Nimmo, re-signed late-inning reliever Chris Martin, and added depth players Tyler Alexander, Alexis Díaz, and Danny Jansen. There is a glaring need in the back of the rotation though. Even if Rocker has what feels like a long-awaited breakout, there's room for improvement in the starting staff.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tAngels sign Pomeranz, Romano  Late Tuesday night the Angels reinforced their bullpen with lefty Drew Pomeranz and righty Jordan Romano. Pomeranz gets one year and $4 million. Romaro received one year and $2 million. They'll join righty Robert Stephenson in new manager Kurt Suzuki's late-inning mix. Neither Pomeranz nor Romano ranked among our top 50 free agents.  \nThe Angels ranked 28th in bullpen ERA and 27th in bullpen WAR in 2025, and that was with Kenley Jansen have a strong season in the closer's role. Pomeranz had a resurgent 2025 for the Cubs while Romano fits the Halos' offseason M.O. as a recognizable name looking to bounce back next season. Previous additions Vaughn Grissom, Alek Manoah, and Grayson Rodriguez all fit the bill as well.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last time WNBA fans saw Kelsey Mitchell was the third quarter of Game 5 of the semifinals against the Las Vegas Aces. Despite the Indiana Fever losing Caitlin Clark and four other players to season-ending injuries ahead of the playoffs, the young and scrappy team was within reach of making the Finals for the first time since 2015.The Aces were up, though barely, at home. Mitchell, who already had 15 points in the game, was driving to the rim when the refs stopped play to call an offensive foul on Aliyah Boston, which was her fifth foul of the game. On its own, that was a massive blow to the Fever. However, it was what happened to Mitchell that would cause more concern. The team's leading scorer hunched over in pain and reached out to the nearest official to indicate something was wrong. Mitchell was guided to the floor, where she remained as players from both teams rushed to cover her behind towels for her privacy. A stretcher was brought out, though Mitchell would eventually walk off the court with her arms around two Indiana personnel. The Fever would lose Game 5 107-98 in overtime to the eventual WNBA champions, while Mitchell was taken to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with Rhabdomyolysis, a scary condition in which damaged muscle tissue breaks down and releases harmful proteins into the bloodstream. \nOn Monday, during Unrivaled's media day, Mitchell provided an update on her health.\"I feel great. I feel fine. I think I just had hopefully a once-in-a-lifetime experience, something I hopefully don't have to experience anymore,\" she told CBS Sports. \"I think God sat me down on purpose.\" \nThe 'ultimate teammate'Rhabdomyolysis is brought on by several factors, including, in Mitchell's case, intense exercise. But Mitchell, who will play in Unrivaled in early 2026 and is signed up to play in Project B next WNBA offseason, says she doesn't plan to change her approach to basketball due to the injury. \n\"I did play to the wheels fell off, literally, but I think it was just for the better cause of what our season was. I would do it all over again,\" Mitchell said. \"I'm gonna do my best to be me and try to be me. And if that does happen again, I guess it'll happen again.\" It is not a surprise that Mitchell was spent at the end of the season. She carried a very heavy load for the injury-ravaged Fever last season, especially during a grueling and surprising playoff run, and had the best season of her eight-year WNBA career, averaging a career-high 20.2 points per game in the regular season and 22.3 points in the postseason. The Game 5 against Vegas was her 52nd WNBA game of the season.On Monday her Fever teammate and Unrivaled colleague Lexie Hull praised Mitchell's dedication.\n\"Kelsey is just the ultimate teammate. She pushed herself and her body to the absolute limits and laid everything she had on the line for us,\" Hull said. \"She just does that every single day, and obviously, really sad to see how the season ended for our team, but also just how it ended for her, because I know more than anything, she'd want to be out there for the last buzzer went off. So I love her. She's a great teammate, and just so proud of the effort she continues to put in every day,\" An uncertain futureMitchell has been with the Fever since they drafted her with the No. 2 overall pick in 2018.  But Mitchell is a free agent right now -- as is the majority of the WNBA -- and will have to wait until the new CBA is signed to start planning out her future. The CBA deadline has been extended twice since the 2025 season ended, and is currently set to expire on Jan. 9, a few days after Unrivaled tips off. \nIn its inaugural year, Unrivaled proved to be the league where players' free-agency conversations took place. Mitchell, who explored free agency for the first time last season, opted to re-sign with the Fever. The Fever have expressed a desire to re-sign Mitchell, but on Monday she said she will be open to all conversations when the time comes. While the new CBA will hopefully lead to clarity about where she will play next season, Mitchell hopes it also will lead to healthier players and better development opportunities across the league. In their latest proposal, the WNBPA is pushing for a CBA that requires teams to carry 12 players and two additional developmental players at all times. Additional roster spots has long been a topic of conversation among players, some suggesting roster expansion should happen before team expansion. \"Anything that you do that can withstand us being who we need to be, without, you know, overcompensating so much [is good],\" Mitchell said. \"If you have a developmental league, I think the players that are on the team ... you get the chance to grow with each other.\" \nFor now, Mitchell is grateful for the opportunity to hit the court with Unrivaled to assess her health and her game.\"I feel good getting back into it. Is it easy? Heck, no. One of the hardest things ever is when you have to reset and then come back and do everything all over again. But honestly, man, I think it's worth it. It made everything worth it,\" Mitchell said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Golden State Warriors entered this season with a clear goal: Don't wind up in the same situation they were in last year where they had to fight for their lives down the stretch of the regular season just to make the Play-In Tournament. It's not looking so good. Through one-third of the regular season, the Warriors are 13-14 with a bottom-10 offense. If the postseason were to start today they would again have to win a play-in game just to make the playoffs, and even that's dicey. Golden State is tied in the loss column with No. 9 Memphis and is two losses from the lottery. Utah has just one more defeat on its ledger. Portland two. The Mavericks, a recent punchline of the league, have only lost three more games than the Warriors. Think about that.   There is no shortage of reasons for Golden State's early season scuffles. They're old, and it shows. They're slow and lack any semblance of athletic force with Jonathan Kuminga yet again removed from the rotation. The defense looks good on paper (currently No. 5) but even that feels deceiving. A team that can have this much trouble containing penetration that also doesn't have traditional rim protection is set up for scramble drills. When it really gets down to it, the Warriors aren't that hard to score on. They're 5-9 in clutch games with the league's seventh-worst defense in the highest-leverage minutes. They're small, sometimes so far as tiny. They get killed on the glass. As is basically a matter of corporate policy, they turn the ball over like crazy. And then there's the matter of Jimmy Butler, who, much like the defense, looks beyond reproach on paper. Butler is averaging 19 PPG on what is basically a career-high true-shooting percentage and what is, by far, a career-high 44% 3-point clip. He's one of five players in the league adding five assists, five rebounds and 1.5 steals to that sheet. The Warriors are 12.5 points better per 100 possessions when he's on the floor, the best mark on the team, per Cleaning the Glass, where you'll also find that his 129.2 points per 100 shots is another career high. His drives, paint touches, usage and free-throw rates are all basically identical to last season. \nYou would think, with numbers like this, you would feel Butler's impact all over games. But you don't. Yes, he does a lot of little things well that aren't going to grab headlines. We know he's smart. Competitive. He calms a chaotic offense. But the bottom line is for a guy making $54 million this season, Butler isn't doing enough. Steve Kerr knows it, and he's taking the blame. \"I'm not doing my job well this year,\" Kerr told reporters following Golden State's loss to the Blazers on Sunday. He was speaking generally here. The turnovers. Maybe the ongoing Kuminga debacle. But then Kerr addressed, specifically, the production of Butler, who made three shots against the Blazers, hasn't reached the 20-point mark in two weeks, and is averaging just 11 shots per game for the season. \"I've got to find a way to get him more into the groove of the game,\" Kerr said. \"I don't really consider Jimmy's game to be dependent on how many shots he gets, but we do need his scoring. We do need his playmaking.\n\"I thought we did a better job last year putting [Butler] in position to attack and create shots for people. We need to get back to that type of control of the game where we are going to him in the half court. We've had a few moments during the season, but we're not able to consistently put the ball in Jimmy's hands and let him control games at the end of last year.\"Kerr made particular mention of a four-possession stretch against the Timberwolves, when Curry was off the floor, in which Butler didn't touch the ball one time.\"That's on me,\" Kerr said. \"But that's also on our players to understand. I can't call a play every time. Nor do I want to. We have to find a way in collaboration to make sure we are playing through Jimmy.\"\nKerr says he needs to prioritize running a more traditional, intentional offense through Butler when Curry is on the bench rather than sticking with the \"random flow\" on which they rely so heavily with Curry out there. Butler agrees. Last month he told ESPN that if you're \"trying to run the Steph stuff\" when Steph isn't in the game, \"it's not going to work.\"The numbers support this hypothesis. When Curry sits, the Warriors go from an offensive rating that would rank No. 6 to the worst offensive in the league, per CTG. Kerr is correct that he is the one with his hand on the switch, and if he wants Butler running more pick-and-roll and iso offense when Curry isn't on the floor, it's his job to make that happen. But there's also an element of responsibility that falls on Butler, and Heat fans know all too well what this means. The masses remember the Jimmy Buckets playoff runs, which were legendary, but as his time in Miami wound down, and even to some degree during some of the prime times, he was frustratingly, even maddeningly unwilling to commit himself to the Buckets part of his moniker. \nThere's a fine line between patience and passive, and Butler's lean toward the latter has been a talking point from the time he arrived in Golden State. The Warriors acquired Butler in February, and by March reporters who clearly hadn't watched these habits in Miami were already asking about his reluctance to take basically any shot that either didn't appear at the end of a red carpet or he wasn't forced into by a dwindling shot clock. \"When it's my time [to score], you'll know it's my time,\" Butler said. Then that time came in the second round of the playoffs when Curry got hurt early in Game 1. From that point forward, the Warriors had one path to winning even one game against the Timberwolves, which was all they needed to do to extend the series long enough for Curry to get back on the floor: Butler had to flip the scoring switch. He did if for one game, not coincidentally the one the Warriors had a real chance to win, but even then he didn't score a single point over the game's final eight minutes. Other than that, he spent that entire series as the Michael Jordan of jump stops and head fakes that lead to \"here you take it\" kick-out passes to less capable, if not entirely incapable, creators. Butler was passing up restricted-area shots to toss grenades out to Kevon Looney behind the 3-point line. When Golden State needed an alpha, it wasn't Butler who stepped up. It was Kuminga. \nOf course, there's always been a excuse. When Butler first showed up, he was, as he explained it, deferring by choice -- prioritizing his new teammates until it was \"his time.\" Then when it was his time and he turned into the invisible man against the Timberwolves, he was hurt. Now this year he's making $54 million to take 11 shots and score fewer points per game than Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and it's Kerr's fault for not putting him in proper positions? Here's an idea: Put yourself in the proper positions. Yes, the Warriors play with flow and it sounds like Kerr hasn't explicitly said \"let's run more pick and roll for Jimmy.\" But anyone who watches the Warriors with an objective eye knows he has plenty of opportunities to assert himself. Plenty. And this isn't just when Curry isn't on the floor with him. Butler, who has openly talked about how Golden State can't keep expecting Curry to bail them out with superhero scoring runs, is the guy who's supposed to make Curry's job easier, not just chew up the few minutes he's resting. \nAgain, it looks like Butler is doing all he can on paper. The catch-all advanced metrics slot him as one of the league's most impactful players. But if you think Butler's high-efficiency marks are solely indicative of a guy having a good shooting season, you're wrong. When you only take premium shots while passing out of just about anything even halfway contested under the guise of \"right play\" basketball, your efficiency numbers are going to look great. Butler is too happy to operate, particularly in the half court, just like every other part of the Steph support staff, cutting into the space that Curry's movement creates, thriving in the cracks, et cetera. To truly lighten Curry's load, he has to actually create offense for himself, and more, actually finish that offense rather than dipping his toe into the water and quickly deciding its too cold to take the plunge. The Warriors rank dead last in paint points per game, a deficiency that Butler was supposed to specifically address. I once had a scout describe Butler as one of the league's most \"careful\" superstars and I've never thought of a better way to describe it. If you only look for the safe shots, you're not going to find very many. Which is fine for a role player. But Butler is supposed to be a star. He's certainly being paid like one. \nKerr can be the fall guy here if he wants, and it's not to suggest he can't get pretty stubborn in his approach in his own right. But Butler needs to take the bulk of the blame for a problem you would never even know is there if you were to just look at the stats. \n            ",

Well, at least the knockout rounds. The qualifier games are still mostly about the weird courts. But these elimination battles are, and have been since the start of this thing, irrefutably awesome. We saw it again with the Knicks' victory over the Spurs for the championship on Tuesday. \nThe game didn't count on paper. But it counts here. The Knicks are rolling. The Spurs are ready to make real playoff noise right now. Meanwhile, the Bulls are on an all-time pathetic 11-game crash. All this and more in this week's Power Rankings. Note: As a general Power Rankings rule, we're going to try to strike a balance between what we've seen in the last week, the season as a whole so far, and what can reasonably be expected to play out over the next few weeks. We will not go so far as to rank these teams based on championship expectations, because in that case it would take a lot more to alter, at least in tiers, the generally accepted hierarchy. Winning matters, and it will get you on the move up this board form week to week. But if you're beating bad teams, just as an example, and probably playing a little above your head, it's not necessarily going to be reflected in a completely commensurate climb up the rankings.

Sure, it took a terrible call to get them to overtime, but to win a game like that against a team like that, without Aaron Gordon or Christian Braun no less, is a take-note statement. Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray combined for 74 points, and Jokic put up a ho-hum 30-15-10-2-2 line. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            19-6\n                        \n                                3\n                            \n                                    Rockets\n                                \n                            The Clippers don't look like much in the standings but on any given night they do have major talent, and the Rockets caught them on one of those given nights and won in fitting fashion: Amen Thompson's go-ahead tip-in on the FOURTH offensive rebound of a single possession. Then, as detailed above, the Rockets took Denver to the wire and perhaps would've won if not for a phantom call on Thompson when Tim Hardaway Jr. actually tripped over his own feet. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            16-7\n                        \n                                4\n                            \n                                    Knicks\n                                \n                            The Knicks won a championship! Their first trophy since 1973! Fine print: It came in the 2025 Emirates Cup by defeating San Antonio in Vegas on Tuesday. The game didn't count in the official standings but we're definitely factoring it in here. The Knicks played fantastic and have now won (not including Tuesday) 10 of their last 11. Over the three elimination Cup games, Mitchell Robinson piled up 18 offensive rebounds, including 10 against San Antonio. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            18-7\n                        \n                                5\n                            \n                                    Spurs\n                                \n                            As mentioned above, the Spurs lost to the Knicks in the Emirates Cup championship on Tuesday, but the loss never technically happened on paper. So the Spurs are actually still on a three-game winning streak that includes dealing the Thunder just their second loss of the season in an incredible game that announced the Spurs as a legit force right now. Stephon Castle, De'Aaron Fox and Dylan Harper is a nasty guard trio to have alongside Victor Wembanyama. You do not want to see this team in the playoffs. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            18-7\n                        \n                                6\n                            \n                                    Pistons\n                                \n                            Right when Detroit's 13-game winning streak ends with two straight losses and you think things might actually slow down, boom, they win six of their next seven. Detroit is the best defense in the league outside of OKC, which is in its own league. Detroit defeated Atlanta by committee with 10 guys scoring at least nine points. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            21-5\n                        \n                                7\n                            \n                                    Timberwolves\n                                \n                            Make it seven wins in eight games for the Wolves with the latest coming over the healthy Warriors. On paper, that looks like yet another win for Minnesota over a sub-500 team (even though the Warriors were 13-12 before that game tipped), but that's a nice win on the road without Anthony Edwards. \n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            17-9\n                        \n                                8\n                            \n                                    Lakers\n                                \n                            The Lakers' defense is in the gutter of late. Some of that is opponents' shooting luck, some of it is them being really slow. But this team is built to beat you with its offense. Defeating the Suns without Austin Reaves is no small feat. The Lakers are now 9-0 in clutch games. You can either look at that as evidence of their late-game magic with three incredible shot creators, or as an unsustainable run of fortune in close games that could very well, at some point, start swinging the other way. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            18-7\n                        \n                                9\n                            \n                                    Celtics\n                                \n                            The Celtics fell back to earth with two straight losses.

The more important development is Joel Embiid scoring 39 points (his most since May of 2024) against Indiana and then turning around and putting up 22 and 14 against the Hawks playing on one day's rest for the first time this season. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            14-11\n                        \n                                13\n                            \n                                    Hawks\n                                \n                            The Hawks have lost four of six and took a 27-point shellacking from the Pistons on Friday. The bounced back to beat the Sixers and they remain in the thick of the East as one of seven teams with either 11 or 12 losses. Trae Young is coming back. Kristaps Porziņģis is out with another illness so it's not a full-strength look, but we need to see what Young can do in terms of fitting back in to what the Hawks have become without him without torpedoing the defense. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            15-12\n                        \n                                14\n                            \n                                    Raptors\n                                \n                            Toronto had lost four straight and six of seven before the Miami Heat, who've now lost five straight themselves, showed up on the schedule and stopped the bleeding. Since the end of their stretch of 13 wins in 14 games, the Raptors are being outshot from the 3-point line and their defense has slipped by six points per 100 possessions. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            16-11\n                        \n                                15\n                            \n                                    Cavaliers\n                                \n                            We're all going to hold out hope for the Cavs because their numbers are so great when the core four play together. But they've hardly done that this season. Darius Garland has only played 11 games. Jarrett Allen 16. Now Evan Mobley is out for maybe a month with a calf strain. Meanwhile the Cavs have lost to the 10-16 Blazers, the Warriors without their three best players, and the Hornets, while needing a 17-point rally just to get past the Wizards, over the past two weeks. Now go look at their post-Christmas schedule. It's murder. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            15-12\n                        \n                                16\n                            \n                                    Heat\n                                \n                            The Heat have lost five straight. The only three teams they've beaten in the last three weeks are the Mavericks, Bucks and Clippers. Over that stretch they've registered the league's fifth-worst offense. Last Saturday they lost to the Kings by 16. \n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            14-12\n                        \n                                17\n                            \n                                    Warriors\n                                \n                            So much for all that Pat Spencer momentum. Stephen Curry has been back for two games and the Warriors lost them both -- first to the Wolves without Anthony Edwards and then to the 10-16 Blazers ... for the third time this season. \n                        \n                            5\n                        \n                            13-14\n                        \n                                18\n                            \n                                    Mavericks\n                                \n                            Cooper Flagg went for a career-high 42 on Monday, but the Mavericks still lost to Utah in overtime with Anthony Davis ... what do you know ... back in street clothes. Davis had been playing very well and the Mavericks have won five of their last seven -- just enough to make them think they might want to stay competitive this season rather than start selling off assets for a tank, which is what they should so ahead of what will likely be their last chance at a high lottery pick until 2031, the next time they own their own first-round pick outright after this summer. You want to get Flagg a young co-star on the same timeline? This is probably your last chance. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            10-17\n                        \n                                19\n                            \n                                    Grizzlies\n                                \n                            Ja Morant shot 11 for 32 over his first two games back from a 10-game calf-sprain absence. Then he promptly left Memphis' win over the Clippers with a sprained ankle. Zach Edey being out through at least the first week of January stinks; Memphis was blasting opponents in his minutes. If the play-in tourney were to start today, Memphis would be in. Hooray. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            12-14\n                        \n                                20\n                            \n                                    Jazz\n                                \n                            The Jazz have won four of six. Keyonte George has scored 76 points over the last two, both wins. If the postseason started today, Utah would be in the play-in and is just one loss back of the No. 8 seed. Utah does have a tough stretch of schedule coming up. That's good news for the rest of the league that needs the Jazz's 2026 first-round pick to stay inside the top eight, lest it get shipped to Oklahoma City, which is already getting the Clippers' first-round pick. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            10-15\n                        \n                                21\n                            \n                                    Trail Blazers\n                                \n                            Portland ended a three-game skid (that included a loss to the Pelicans) with a win over the Warriors, who were back to full strength. But they've still lost six of their last eight. If Portland wants to take advantage of an upcoming stretch in which is plays 20 of 29 games at home, two things need to happen: Shaedon Sharpe needs to continue his efficient scoring (24 PPG on 49/48/82 shooting splits over his last six games), and Jrue Holiday needs to get back, which will put some life back into what was, in the early going, a top-five defense that has plummeted to 22nd. \n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            10-16\n                        \n                                22\n                            \n                                    Hornets\n                                \n                            The Hornets take all the right shots on paper -- top 10 in both rim and 3-point frequency, per CTG, giving them a top-five expected field-goal percentage. Problem is, outside of rookie sniper Kon Kneuppel, they don't actually make many of those shots (22nd in actual eFG%). They did manage to beat the Cavs on Sunday, but right now a good rec league team might beat the Cavs. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            8-18\n                        \n                                23\n                            \n                                    Bucks\n                                \n                            Milwaukee might've gotten a little bump in the rankings after its win over Boston had they not turned around, after a two-day rest, and taken a 45-point whacking by the Nets. Giannis clearly doesn't want anything to do with officially asking out. If he refrains from taking that last step and the Bucks are desperate enough (which we know they are after they signed Myles Turner) to see that as hope, Jon Horst is known for pulling off trades nobody saw coming.\n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            11-16\n                        \n                                24\n                            \n                                    Nets\n                                \n                            Brooklyn has taken advantage of a cushy recent schedule with wins over the Bucks, Pelicans, Bulls and Hornets over their last six games. That's about to end. Over their next nine the Nets face Miami, Toronto, Philadelphia, Minnesota, Golden State, Houston, Denver and Orlando.  \n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            7-18\n                        \n                                25\n                            \n                                    Clippers\n                                \n                            The Clippers put up a fight against Minnesota and Houston but lost both by a combined five points. Don't start looking for silver linings, however. They followed that up with an 18-point loss to the Grizzlies, their ninth defeat in 10 games. It remains unbelievable how bad this team is. It has to be one of the worst roster-relative starts to a season in at least recent history. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            6-20\n                        \n                                26\n                            \n                                    Pelicans\n                                \n                            The Pelicans, who've won two straight to end a seven-game skid, need to trade Trey Murphy III, Herb Jones and Zion Williamson, if there's even a taker for the latter. This team belongs to Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears. It's just a shame New Orleans doesn't own its 2026 first-round pick, at least with some protections. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            5-22\n                        \n                                27\n                            \n                                    Wizards\n                                \n                            Be honest: Did you even know that Marvin Bagley III played for the Wizards? He does. And he's put up 38 points and 27 rebounds over the last two games, one of which the Wizards actually won against the Pacers. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            4-20\n                        \n                                28\n                            \n                                    Pacers\n                                \n                            Two more losses since last week's Power Rankings for the Pacers. It's a gap year. Who really cares. They'll get a lottery pick, perhaps No. 1 overall, to pair with Tyrese Haliburton when he returns next season. \n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            6-20\n                        \n                                29\n                            \n                                    Kings\n                                \n                            The Kings were the unofficial sponsor of the NBA Cup championship game on Monday night when former Sacramento point guard De'Aaron Fox faced off against former Kings coach Mike Brown. The Kings aren't very good at making themselves better, but they sure are good at helping other teams. They've also lost seven of their last eight. \n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            6-20\n                        \n                                30\n                            \n                                    Bulls\n                                \n                            The fact that the Bulls have lost eight of their last nine games sounds bad enough. But it gets worse when you look at the opponents. Only one of those losses came against a team with a winning record (Orlando). The other seven came against the Pelicans (twice), Pacers (twice), Nets, Warriors and Hornets. The combined record of those teams is 39-82. The Bulls are not the worst team in the league, but after that kind of stretch they deserve at least one week in the cellar to consider their behavior. \n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            10-15\n                        \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

In six years as the starter in Miami when healthy, Tagovailoa went 44-32 and lost his only playoff appearance. The league leader in interceptions at the time of his benching, Tagovailoa now faces an uncertain future in the league and the hope he can resurrect his career with a new team.So who will replace Tagovailoa at quarterback beginning this Sunday against the Bengals? Not his direct backup Zach Wilson, the No. 2 overall pick of the Jets in 2021. Instead it'll be rookie Quinn Ewers, who was selected in the seventh round out of Texas. This will be his second NFL game after he went 5 of 8 for 53 yards in mop-up duty during Miami's 31-6 loss to the Browns back in October.The question running through the minds of Dolphins fans heading into Sunday is whether Ewers has a chance to establish himself as the team's starting QB in 2026 and beyond. We went deep on Ewers before the draft as part of our series of scouting reports. Here's some of what Fantasy analyst and tape fiend Dave Richard had to say:\n Quinn Ewers NFL Draft profile \nAge as of Week 1: 22Height: 6-foot-2 ⅛Weight: 214  Hand size: 9 ⅜Comparable body-type to: Andy Dalton  \tCBS prospect ranking  Position: No. 4 QB | Overall: 107Consensus big board ranking (via NFL Mock Draft Database): No. 71 overall (No. 5 QB)To check out all of CBSSports.com's most recent mock drafts, click here.  \n  NFL comparison: Colt McCoyEwers might remind you of another former Longhorns quarterback in Colt McCoy. Both had good enough size to go with a good enough arm to manage an offense, but both didn't have the cannon-arm strength or long-ball touch to threaten defenses deep. You might believe Ewers had maybe a touch more arm strength than McCoy, but McCoy was a little more mobile. In the end, Ewers should be able to put together a long career as a reasonably solid backup, just as McCoy did. Quinn Ewers scouting report  Accolades  Career: Third in school history in both passing yards (9,128) and passing touchdowns (68)Two-time second-team all-conference (Big 12 in 2023 and SEC in 2024)2023: Big 12 Championship MVPStrengths  Solid height and size for the position.Typically had good arm mechanics with a quick, snappy release. Would change his release point based on the type of throw he was making, including a sidearm-style release to get a little more juice on the ball.Generally had good pocket awareness with a number of examples of him stepping up away from pass-rush pressure while keeping his eyes downfield.Might be among the tops in the class at processing defensive coverages when needed, even if he didn't always take advantage. When he didn't force it to his first read, Ewers was capable of finding his second and sometimes his third read in the offense.Ewers knew all the keys to look for when targeting a defender and took advantage frequently. Would smartly attack blitzes by throwing to targets in the area where the blitz came from and had the knack for ganging up on defensive backs who turned their backs to him.Has the potential to develop how to manipulate coverages with his eyes. Would sometimes show how to move defenders by looking one way and then throwing another, and he even dabbled in some no-look passes.Capably threw with good timing and anticipation.Especially nice touch on short and mid-range passes, and many came when he was off-platform.Consistently displayed good placement and accuracy on short-range throws. Was among the best in this draft class on passes of nine or fewer air yards. Had his moments on longer throws as well.Clearly battle tested: Started against nine teams ranked in the top 25 in 2024, more than anyone else in college football. Led Texas to six wins in those games. Also led Texas to the College Football Playoff in 2024 and 2025. Concerns  Played 35 snaps from under center in 2024 and 72 over three years at Texas. Most prospects in the class don't have much experience playing from under center, nor is it a detriment.Ewers' pocket awareness and sensitivity to the pass rush were inconsistent. Sometimes he would be ignorant of the pass rush and complete a pass within a nanosecond of getting shellacked, and sometimes he'd be so ignorant of the pass rush that he'd get hammered from the blind side. When Ewers was aware of the pass rush, he'd sometimes adjust accordingly and make a play, and sometimes he'd panic. It's something he has to improve on at the next level.Ewers played on the balls of his feet a good amount of the time, setting himself up for some inaccuracy when he didn't plant his front foot. Additionally, Ewers' footwork in the pocket sometimes broke down and may have been responsible for some off-target throws. This fix is coachable.Threw a litany of short screens, quick outs, flares and check-down passes. Of his total attempts last season, 28.3% of them were on those small, easy throws inside of two air yards from the line of scrimmage. Those plays accounted for 38.6% of his completions, 23.2% of his yards and 16.1% of his touchdowns. At times, Ewers would check-down prematurely and not take the extra second to scan for an open target -- even when he had a clean pocket.Be it because of the scheme or his own unwillingness to test his arm, Ewers seldom made tight-window throws in 2024.Every coach will have issues with Ewers' arm strength, velocity and accuracy on longer throws. Last season he was last among the top QB prospects in his class with a 47% completion rate on throws of 10-plus air yards with a 25.8% off-target rate. His career completion rate on throws of 30-plus yards was 20% (17 of 85) with a 60% off-target rate. And Ewers had just one pass in three years travel least 50 air yards. Frequently did his long throws hang in the air and not have desirable velocity. Without zip, strength or drive consistently on intermediate or downfield throws, defenses will be able to key in on Ewers' shorter attempts. At 62.7%, his overall completion rate was the worst of the top-eight prospects in the draft class.Had a dozen passes batted at the line of scrimmage, most of any of the top quarterbacks in the class. His sometimes-sidearm delivery definitely contributed to some of them.No better than average speed made Ewers much less of a flight risk with his feet than other quarterbacks. Did know when and how to slide to end a run, though.Has an injury history: Played through a torn oblique and injured his ankle in 2024; suffered a grade 2 AC joint sprain in his left shoulder in 2023; suffered a right SC joint sprain in his right (throwing) shoulder in 2022; had a core muscle injury that cost him six games in high school in 2020.Bottom line  \nEwers has traits that could help him navigate an NFL offense in due time, but the lack of arm strength and accuracy beyond 10 yards will not only limit what an offense can do around him but better set up a defense to force some turnovers. Tack on a lack of consistency when it comes to dealing with the pass rush, and the one-time top prospect of the nation might only elevate to being a quality backup who could pick up wins if a starter misses a few games.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas freshman Darryn Peterson missed his eighth game of the season Tuesday after leaving Saturday's victory over NC State with what was subsequently described as cramping in a quad.That obviously stinks for him.But tucked into Bill Self's 54-word statement that was shared via social media prior to tipoff was an acknowledgement that Peterson was at, and in, Monday's practice. Problem is, the projected No. 1 overall pick of the 2026 NBA Draft, according to recent mock drafts from Adam Finkelstein and Kyle Boone, just felt, according to Self, a similar kind of cramping. And as any basketball player who has ever experienced anything uncomfortable in a hamstring or quad will tell you -- and Peterson has reportedly been dealing with both -- trying to push it by playing on it is usually just about the dumbest thing you can do, especially if you're someone theoretically worth hundreds of millions of dollars.So it's unsurprising that Peterson didn't play in the Jayhawks' 73-49 victory vs. Towson on Tuesday. But, if I were a Kansas fan, I'd be encouraged by Self's acknowledgement that Peterson at least tried to go two days after leaving the NC State game late, and also by the fact that Self opted to conclude Tuesday's statement with this sentence: \"[Peterson] will continue to work tirelessly, and prepare to compete with his teammates, and represent Kansas in the very near future.\"\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Fred Hoiberg's Cornhuskers are feel-good story of the year; NPOY race heats up\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nI know lots of people have theories about what's going on with Peterson, so let me tell you mine: I think he wants to play but is being hindered by his body, and, just as soon as he isn't, he'll be playing once again, and starring once again, for the Jayhawks.\nWhen will that be?It's obviously difficult to predict.But KU's next game is Monday at home against a Davidson team that's ranked 126th at EvanMiya.com, and the Jayhawks' next game against a currently ranked opponent isn't until they host Iowa State on Jan. 13. So, if Peterson can return before T.J. Otzelberger's Cyclones visit Allen Fieldhouse in 27 days, that would be excellent. But the four-game stretch immediately in front of Kansas is literally the easiest four-game stretch left on the schedule, which, in my opinion at least, places no urgency on the situation at all.Again, if Peterson can play Monday against Davidson, great. But the most important thing here, way more important than that or anything else, is getting him back to a place where he feels nothing uncomfortable from the waist down, and then watching him stay that way through this season's finish line. Because, when it comes to a prospect like Peterson, we're just rarely going to see two years of college. So, the wise thing is to do everything possible to increase the likelihood that we get to watch him in March, even if that means not seeing him as much as any of us would like in November, December and January.Anyway ...\nKansas is up to No. 12 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the eighth consecutive day. The Wolverines are 10-0 with a net rating at KenPom.com of +37.53. That's more than four points better than anybody else this season, more than one point better than the net rating the national champion (Florida) finished with last season, and among the reasons why Michigan is currently the clear favorite, at +450, to win the 2026 NCAA Tournament, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

    "body": "\n        With just three weeks left to play in the NFL season, only two playoff spots have been clinched, but that number could be going way up in Week 16. A total of nine teams could clinch a spot this weekend and if you want to know what those clinching scenarios look like, we've got you covered here. We're not here to talk about who's going to clinch, though. Instead, we're here to do some playoff projections. We already know that the Rams and Broncos have clinched a spot in the postseason, but the 12 other spots are still up in the air. With that in mind, we had Stephen Oh of SportsLine simulate the rest of the season so we could figure who's going to make the playoffs. So what's the playoff field going to look like? Let's take a look at the projections (And remember, this is just a projection. If you want to see the actual playoff picture, we've got that here. If your favorite team has already been eliminated from postseason contention, then you might be more interested in reading a mock draft, and if that's the case, we have one of those for you right here). \nAFC playoff projectionProjections via SportsLine\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (AFC West champion)Remaining schedule: Jaguars, at Chiefs, ChargersAfter beating the Packers in Week 15, the Broncos (12-2) are officially the Super Bowl favorite in the eyes of the computer. According to our projection, the Broncos have a 14.6% chance of winning the Lombardi Trophy, which is the highest number in the AFC by far (No other team is above 9%). It's also slightly ahead of the Seahawks (13.9%) and Rams (13.4%) for the highest number in the NFL. One reason the computer likes the Broncos so much is because they're in total control of the top seed. The Broncos can clinch the top spot by going just 2-1 in their final three games regardless of what happens in any other game.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (AFC East champion)Remaining schedule: at Ravens, at Jets, DolphinsAlthough the Patriots (11-3) lost a rough one to the Bills in Week 15, the computer still likes them to win the AFC East. According to SportsLine, the Patriots have a 59.7% chance of winning the division while the Bills are sitting at just 40.3%. The Patriots can clinch a playoff berth this week with a win over the Ravens, but even if they lose, they'll still be in good shape as long as they beat both the Jets and Dolphins. If they win those two games, that would clinch the division record tiebreaker over the Bills. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (AFC South champion)Remaining schedule: at Broncos, at Colts, TitansThere is only one race in the AFC that the computer views as a true coin flip and that's the AFC South. Right now, the Jaguars (10-4) are being given a 50% chance to win the division, but the Texans are right behind them at 48.3%. The biggest problem for the Jags is that Houston holds most of the tiebreaker scenarios if the two teams end up with the same record. For instance, if both teams finish 12-5, the Texans will win the division. Basically, the Jaguars have no margin for error down the stretch. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (AFC North champion)Remaining schedule: at Lions, at Browns, RavensThe Steelers have a one-game lead on the Ravens and they currently hold the head-to-head tiebreaker, which is why the computer views Pittsburgh as the favorite to win the AFC North right now. According to the computer, the Steelers have a 65.9% chance of winning the division while the Ravens are at 34.1%. The biggest advantage for the Steelers is that even if they lose their next two games, they'll still win the division title if they beat the Ravens in Week 18. One reason the computer doesn't like the Ravens is because they have the third-most difficult remaining strength of schedule with games against the Patriots and Packers before facing the Steelers during the final week of the season. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Buffalo Bills (Wild card 1)Remaining schedule: at Browns, Eagles, JetsAt this point, it seems highly unlikely that the Bills (10-4) are going to catch the Patriots in the AFC East, which means they'll almost certainly be headed to the postseason as a wild card team. If that happens, the Bills will have to hit the road for the opening round of the playoffs, which isn't necessarily great news for the Bills, because Josh Allen never won a postseason road game in his career (0-4). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Chargers (Wild card 2)Remaining schedule: at Cowboys, Texans, at DenverThe Chargers (10-4) have one of the most brutal schedules in the NFL over the final three weeks of the season. Their game in Week 17 against the Texans could end determining which team ends up getting the higher playoff seed. For now, the computer has the Chargers locked in at the sixth spot. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (Wild card 3)Remaining schedule: Raiders, at Chargers, ColtsThe Texans have a 92.6% chance of making the playoffs, so at this point, they feel like a lock. If they win out, there's also a good chance they'll end up winning the AFC South. Winning the division would be huge for a Texans team that has won three straight playoff games at home.  Other AFC playoff chances: Ravens (34.1%), Colts (13.7%), Chiefs (ELIMINATED), Bengals (ELIMINATED), Dolphins (ELIMINATED), Browns (ELIMINATED), Jets (ELIMINATED), Raiders (ELIMINATED), Titans (ELIMINATED).AFC wild card round projection (7) Texans at (2) Patriots (6) Chargers at (3) Jaguars (5) Bills at (4) Steelers Bye: Broncos\nNFC playoff projectionProjections via SportsLine\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (NFC West champion)Remaining schedule: at Seahawks, at Falcons, Cardinals The Rams (11-3) have a huge showdown coming on Thursday night against the Seahawks and if they win that game, they'll have the inside track to the No. 1 overall seed. The computer views the Rams as the heavy favorite to get the top seed and win the NFC West. According to SportsLine, the Rams have a 56% chance of winning the division while the Seahawks are way back at 31.4% (The 49ers are also still kicking: They have a 12.6% chance). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Green Bay Packers (NFC North champion)Remaining schedule: at Bears, Ravens, at Vikings The Packers took a huge hit in Week 15 with the loss of Micah Parsons to a season-ending injury, but despite the loss, the computer still likes Green Bay to take home the NFC North crown. The computer is giving the Packers (9-4-1) a 48.5% chance of winning the division, which is just slightly ahead of the Bears, who are 45.2%. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (NFC East champion)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, at Bills, CommandersThe Eagles (9-5) have had some issues this year, but they can put all the drama behind them this week. If they beat the Commanders on Saturday, the Eagles will clinch the NFC East, making them the first team in 21 years to win the division title in back-to-back seasons. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFC South champion) Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at Dolphins, Panthers The Buccaneers (7-7) are currently in a tie with the Panthers, but despite that, the computer is giving Tampa Bay a 75.2% chance of winning the NFC South. The reason that number is so high is because the Bucs hold almost every tiebreaker. If they can split their two meetings with the Panthers over the final three weeks, they'd win the division if both teams finish either 9-8 or 8-9. They'd also win the division if they sweep Carolina.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (Wild card 1)Remaining schedule: Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersThe Seahawks (11-3) are not being projected to win the division, but they are viewed as the Super Bowl favorite out of the NFC. According to the computer, the Seahawks have a 13.9% chance of winning it all, which is ahead of the Rams (13.4%) and Eagles (9.9%). The reason the Seahawks aren't being projected to win the division is because even if they beat the Rams, they still have two tough road games to end the year. That being said, if they do beat the Rams, Seattle will clinch a playoff berth. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (Wild card 2)Remaining schedule: at Colts, Bears, SeahawksThe 49ers (10-4) will be an interesting team to watch over the next few weeks because not only do they still have a chance to win the NFC West, but they could still earn the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. If the 49ers win out and the Seahawks beat the Rams on Thursday night, then San Francisco will go into the postseason as the top seed in the NFC. The 49ers can clinch a playoff berth as soon as this week with a win over the Colts. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Chicago Bears (Wild card 3)Remaining schedule: Packers, at 49ers, LionsRight now, the Bears are being projected to make the playoffs, but the computer views the Lions as their biggest threat, which means we could see scenario where the Week 18 matchup between Chicago and Detroit is an elimination game with a playoff spot on the line. As things currently stand, though, the Bears have an 80.8% chance of getting in the playoffs, which is well ahead of the Lions (33.9%).  Other NFC Playoff Chances: Lions (33.9%), Cowboys (0.83%), Falcons (ELIMINATED), Vikings (ELIMINATED), Commanders (ELIMINATED), Cardinals (ELIMINATED), Saints (ELIMINATED), Giants (ELIMINATED)NFC wild card round projection (7) Bears at (2) Packers (6) 49ers at (3) Eagles (5) Seahawks at (4) Buccaneers Bye: Rams\n            ",

    "body": "\nThere's nothing like a good hot streak in December when it comes to picking NFL games. For me, it's been a bit of a heater.I went 11-5 both straight up and against the spread last week, which has me feeling optimistic heading down the stretch of the regular season.For the season, I am now 117-106-1 ATS and 151-72-1 straight up. To be 11 games over .500 picking every game each week is quite a feat, if I don't say so myself.Let's hope as the weather gets frigid around the country, I can stay as hot as a July day at the beach.All Week 16 NFL betting lines via DraftKings SportsbookLos Angeles Rams (-1) at Seattle SeahawksThursday, 8:15 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime\nThis game will go a long way in deciding the NFC West. The Rams beat the Seahawks earlier this year, but Seattle turned it over four times in that game. They won't do that here. The Rams defense has been leaky lately, which is a concern. Sam Darnold struggled last week, and has struggled the last two times out against the Rams, but I think he plays better here. Seattle is the pick.Pick: Seahawks 29, Rams 24Philadelphia Eagles (-5.5) at Washington CommandersSaturday, 5 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles got back on track last week against the Raiders, while the Commanders won the road against the Giants. But this is a big step up for a Commanders team that has had defensive issues all year long. This rematch of the NFC Championship game goes to the Eagles just like that one did. Philly wins it. Pick: Eagles 32, Commanders 17Green Bay Packers (-1.5) at Chicago BearsSaturday, 8:20 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Packers are reeling after losing to Denver and losing key players, including star edge Micah Parsons for the year with a torn ACL. They beat the Bears two weeks ago at home, but this is a bigger challenge on the road. Chicago is playing well and that offense against the Parsons-less defense will be a lot to handle. But I think Jordan Love comes up big.Pick: Packers 27, Bears 24Buffalo Bills (-10) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Bills are coming off a big road victory over the Patriots and now play a second-consecutive road game against a team they should beat. Motivation could be key, but the Browns have offensive issues. Look for the Bills to take care of things in this one early to win it behind another strong game by Josh Allen. Pick: Bills 27, Browns 14Cincinnati Bengals (-1.5) at Miami DolphinsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Bengals were shut out by the Ravens last week and eliminated from playoff contention, while Miami lost to the Steelers Monday night to also be eliminated. So this game means nothing. With that as a backdrop, give me Miami at home. Devon Achane will run it wild and have a big day. Pick: Dolphins 30, Bengals 26Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Chiefs have been eliminated from the playoffs and Patrick Mahomes is lost for the season. How focused will they be here? Does it matter. The Titans are bad and Gardner Minshew is more than capable of having a solid game. Chiefs win it. Pick: Chiefs 24, Titans 17Los Angeles Chargers at Dallas Cowboys (-1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Chargers have won two straight, while the Cowboys have lost two straight. Dallas is barely alive in the playoff race, and could be eliminated Saturday night if the Eagles win, while the Chargers are surging. But after beating the Chiefs last week, this could be a letdown spot for the Chargers. Dallas can score and I think they will here. Cowboys take it. Pick: Cowboys 33, Chargers 27Minnesota Vikings (-3) at New York GiantsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Vikings are playing consecutive road games, but they played well at Dallas. The Giants didn't look good in the home loss to the Commanders last week. But I think they bounce back here and the defense plays better against J.J. McCarthy. The Giants win it at home. Pick: Giants 24, Vikings 20New York Jets at New Orleans Saints (-4)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jets are out on the road for the second straight week, which is never an easy thing for a bad team playing for nothing. The Saints have showed some fight the past month, which I think continues in this one. Tyler Shough has played well and the Jets have little in terms of offense. Saints win it.Pick: Saints 27, Jets 10Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-3) at Carolina PanthersSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is for first place in the division. Both teams are coming off bad losses that have them at 7-7 and tied for the division lead. The Bucs have not played well on defense as of late, but the Carolina offense isn't great. Look for Baker Mayfield and the Bucs offense to get the best of the Carolina defense, while Bryce Young can't keep up. Pick: Buccaneers 23, Panthers 19Atlanta Falcons (-2.5) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThese two are among the biggest disappointments of the year. The Cardinals are decimated by injuries, which shows up on defense. The Falcons showed they could score against Tampa Bay with Kirk Cousins at quarterback and that will continue in this one. Falcons win it. Pick: Falcons 34, Cardinals 23Jacksonville Jaguars at Denver Broncos (-3)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is the one of the games of the week, featuring the top-seed Broncos against the third-seeded Jaguars. Both teams are playing much better on offense as of late, which could make this fun to watch. This a big proving game for the young Jaguars and I think they can come in and win it with a big day from Trevor Lawrence. Pick: Jaguars 27, Broncos 26Las Vegas Raiders at Houston Texans (-14.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+) \nThe Raiders are bad right now with little semblance of an offense, while the Texans are the best defense in the league. That's a bad combination. The Raiders are also playing consecutive road games with no chance for the playoffs, while the Texans would be in the postseason right now and need it. Texans in a blowout. Pick: Texans 31, Raiders 9Pittsburgh Steelers at Detroit Lions (-7)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a big game for both in their playoff quest. The Lions lost last week, while the Steelers are coming off a Monday night win over the Dolphins. The Steelers defense played well in that one, but this is a big step up in terms of matching offensive firepower. Both teams will score, but the Lions will get more.Pick: Lions 33, Steelers 27New England Patriots at Baltimore Ravens (-3)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC\nThe Patriots are coming off a tough loss at home against the Bills and now must head out to play a Ravens team that shut out the Bengals last week. The Ravens are also more desperate in the playoff race, which matters. Lamar Jackson wins it as the Patriots drop their second straight. Pick: Ravens 30, Patriots 26San Francisco 49ers (-5.5) at Indianapolis ColtsMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis will be the second start for Philip Rivers for the Colts after he almost won at Seattle last week. The 49ers are 10-4 and pushing for a playoff spot. They blew out Tennessee last week, but the defense wasn't great. It won't matter as the 49ers will limit Rivers and Brock Purdy will play well. The 49ers keep on winning.Pick: 49ers 27, Colts 23\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nebraska is the feel-good story of the first six weeks of the college basketball season. The undefeated Cornhuskers own the nation's longest winning streak (15 games), which doubles as the longest winning streak in program history. In October, Fred Hoiberg's team was ranked outside the top 50 in advance metrics and was picked 14th in the Big Ten preview here at CBS Sports. Oops!They fooled just about everybody.Every year, like clockwork, we get a couple of schools that emerge in the first month-plus that overshoot expectations and present an uplifting plot twist. Nebraska is that team for 2025-26. The Cornhuskers are 11-0 after their enthralling 83-80 win at 13th-ranked Illinois on Saturday, the victory-clinching shot via senior Jamarques Lawrence. \nThe result validated Nebraska's reputation and vaulted it into a new tier of respectability. Beating Illinois was the team's third straight conquest of a power-conference opponent. Six days prior was the annual rivalry game against Creighton, which turned into a cruise-control 71-50 win over a down Bluejays squad. Two days later, a head-turning 90-60 thwacking of Wisconsin.\"Then our prize was two-day prep to go to Illinois,\" Hoiberg told CBS Sports by phone earlier this week. \"We wanted to get selfish and get all three. … You've got 17,000 people in a smaller building, the ceiling is right on top of you and when they went on their runs, the concern is how is your team going to be able to handle it.\"\nThey handled it with encouraging sangfroid. The win gave Nebraska a second straight victory over Illinois, the first time that's ever happened, as is the 11-0 start. Nebraska quite literally never does this. The Cornhuskers are one of seven undefeated teams in college basketball. \"I think we've been better than a lot of people thought, than I thought, going into the season,\" Hoiberg said. \"It's rewarding when you have a group that's all about the right things: no distractions, they're on time, academically they take care of exactly what they're supposed to do, and I'm a firm believer that if you take care of that stuff it works out on the court. Since the win, they've gotten over things very quickly. Great locker room celebration, but when we got back on the practice court today, no one even talked about it.\"The win bumped them up to No. 15 in this week's AP Top 25, Nebraska's third-highest ranking in any season. Even though Nebraska didn't load up its nonconference schedule (rank: 203), this looks like a team plenty equipped to make only its ninth NCAA Tournament in school history. Quite the turnabout after Hoiberg was trending toward wash-out status three years ago in his return to college coaching.\nAfter thriving at his alma mater, Iowa State, Hoiberg had to take a chance on himself in the NBA. He coached the Bulls for three years, from 2015-18. In 2019, Nebraska brought him back to the NCAA ranks, offering a new lease on the profession ... but an even tougher task than Hoiberg's reconstruction at Iowa State almost a decade prior.\"We took over the largest rebuild in the history of the Power Five conferences,\" said Hoiberg, \"had one player who averaged two points the previous year, and this was before NIL where you could buy a team. The Big Ten was maybe the deepest the league ever was then, and then we lost a whole team, a whole season to COVID.\"The nadir hit midway through the 2022-23 season. Nebraska lost starters Juwan Gary and Emmanuel Bandoumel to season-ending injuries 11 days apart. Nebraska dropped to 10-13. At that point, Hoiberg was 34-80 in Lincoln. \nThen the team rallied and won six of its final eight regular season games. \"That really, to me, was the team that flipped the script for Nebraska basketball,\" Hoiberg said. \nThe aforementioned injuries also gave opportunities to younger guys like Sam Hoiberg and Lawrence. And as surprising as this undefeated start is, here's why it's not a full-on stunner. Look deeper at what Hoiberg's pulled off the past two years and a half years. Since 2023-24, Nebraska has gone 55-25, a .688 win percentage. That's 19th best out of 79 Power Five programs in that span, just behind Alabama (.714) and Illinois (.702), while just ahead of Creighton (.679) and Kentucky (.675). In 2024, Nebraska made the NCAAs as a No. 8 seed. Last season, no NCAA Tournament but the Huskers did win the patchy postseason event that is the College Basketball Crown and landed at 21-14. \nThe only reason Nebraska wasn't an NCAA Tournament team last season, per Hoiberg, is not having Rienk Mast. The 6-foot-10 Dutch forward sat out due to left knee surgery. Now a 24-year-old senior, Mast has returned as one of the best players in the Big Ten by posting 17.9 points, 6.5 rebounds and shooting 42.6% from 3. There was no silver lining in missing the Big Dance, but a fun run in Vegas resulted in a $300,000 payday for the players and made for a good experience to finish the season.\"Last year there's no doubt we make it to the tournament if Rienk was healthy,\" Hoiberg said. \"We lost three games in a row in one-possession games in all different ways. We didn't protect home court last year but we found a way to win. It gave us momentum going into the postseason, the way we played, we changed things up a little bit and, shit, those guys won $300,000 that they split.  And it's carried over into this season. It helped with the way we played, [it helped] in getting Pryce Sandfort to come aboard.\"\nHoiberg's doing this while overseeing a Nebraska team that, according to my sources, at best ranks 15th (and potentially as low as 17th) in the league in NIL in men's hoops. Hoiberg's NBA experience -- as a player and a coach -- has been massive in offsetting some of Nebraska's disadvantages. \"We're not going to put boundaries on this group,\" he said.Nebraska is infamously the only high-major program to never win an NCAA Tournament game. That drought has a healthy chance of ending in 2026, but to do that you need to get there first. Here's the really good news, Husker fans. Nebraska's next two opponents are North Dakota and New Hampshire, almost definitely automatic wins for Big Red, which means improving to 13-0. According to CBS Sports research, in the past 30 years there have been 96 teams from high-major conferences to start a season 13-0. Of those 96, 86 were good enough to qualify for the NCAAs, which equates to an 89.6% success rate. See you on Selection Sunday, Nebraska.   Boozer is NPOY for now, but Yaxel's not far off  Yaxel Lendeborg is the MVP of a mighty, marvelous Michigan mob. \n                                                                    Jaime Crawford / Getty Images\n                                                            With Christmas coming next week and almost all of the non-con slate over, the race for National Player of the Year is Cameron Boozer's to lose. The Duke five-star freshman had 26 points, 13 rebounds, a season-high six turnovers and three assists in Duke's rickety-yet-inevitable 97-73 win Tuesday night against Lipscomb. Boozer's averages now check in at 23.3 points, 10.2 rebounds, 3.7 assists with 56.3/34.8% FG/3P shooting splits.\nEleven games in, Boozer's been the definition of outstanding. But he's no lock for the NPOY at this point. Michigan's Yaxel Lendeborg has exceeded the hype and is Boozer's closest competition. After what Big Yax did Saturday, the gap could be closing.   Michigan's 101-82 road win at Maryland was the setting for another loaded Lendeborg production: 29 points, nine assists, eight rebounds, three blocks and two steals. One hell of a game. But because Lendeborg was a dime and two snags shy of a triple-double, and because Maryland is non-threatening in its first season under Buzz Williams, his performance didn't prompt a flood of reaction or flashy headlines.  It was rare, though. How rare? What Lendeborg did Saturday was only the fifth game of its kind in the past three decades. It deserves more recognition. That's why I'm here to tell you more about it.\nSince 1995-96, there have been only five instances of a player logging a stat line of 28+ points, 8+ rebounds, 8+ assists, 3+ blocks and 2+ steals in a game. Lendeborg is responsible for two of the five -- and both happened this year. Here's the other four times it's happened:  Maryland's Greivis Vasquez: 35 pts, 11 rebs, 10 asts, 3 blks, 2 stls vs. North Carolina on 2.21.09Charleston Southern's Phlandrous Fleming: 31 pts, 11 asts, 9 rebs, 6 blks, 4 stls @ Gardner-Webb on 1.25.20Coppin State's Anthony Tarke: 34, 10 rebs, 8 asts, 4 blks, 4 stls vs. UNCG on 12.10.20UAB's Lendeborg: 30 pts, 20 rebs, 8 asts, 5 stls, 4 blks vs. ECU on 3.14.25Meaning Lendeborg is only the second player since 1995-96 to do it vs. a power-conference opponent.  A marvelous player, and yet his production at Michigan is not shocking. CBS Sports/247 Sports rated Lendeborg as the No. 1 portal prospect last spring after he was the only player other than Cooper Flagg to lead his team in all five major statistical categories. At UAB, Lendeborg was a monster dominating in semi-obscurity -- so good that he nearly went the NBA route. Instead, Lendeborg bet on himself and is now the focal point on a deep Michigan team that rates No. 1 in almost every predictive metric.   \nHis averages: 16.4 points, 7.2 rebounds, 3.7 assists in a couple fewer minutes per game than Boozer (28.0 to 30.2). His shooting splits are better than Boozer's right now: 59.6% from the field, 40.8% from 3 (on 4.9 attempts per game) and 86.4% from the foul line.   We'll see how the NPOY race brews over the next two months, but it could come to a head on Feb. 21. That's when Duke and Michigan meet in Washington, D.C. in a blockbuster nonconference tilt. It might be the game of the season with the two best players in the sport.       Cronin quietly signed new contract in May     Last season saw UCLA coach Mick Cronin at his crankiest (and, I'd argue, funniest). He had a number of postgame rants that went viral amid a just-OK 23-win run that ended in the second round of the NCAAs with Cronin capping the season by crapping on the NCAA's flight arrangements. As Cronin's continued to speak his mind the past two years, there had been steady gossip in college hoops circles that he might have a wandering eye for other jobs. Well, if he did, that's now almost certainly off the table.     \nIn mid-May, Cronin signed a two-year contract extension with UCLA that increased his salary, buyout and severance terms.      CBS Sports recently obtained the new contract, which when unreported until just this week, when the LA Times first got word out. Unlike in 2022, when Cronin renegotiated, UCLA never announced the updated deal. (This isn't typical at a public university with a high-profile program, though UNC was sluggish to announce Hubert Davis' contract extension last season after it was signed in December of 2024.)     Cronin, 54, is now paid $4.5 million annually -- but that's before factoring in a plethora of bonuses that will easily bump his income well above $5 million per year with the easy-to-achieve incentives in his contract. For example, if Cronin is still UCLA's coach as of April 15, 2026, he'll be paid an additional $500,000 ... just by holding on to the job. That perk will increase to another $600,000 come April 15, 2027, and then 700K the subsequent two years so long as he's still fit to coach in the Westwood sunshine.      Cronin had $10 million guaranteed coming to him on the previous contract (if he'd been fired), but by working a new deal, he more than doubled his payout in the revised paperwork. If the two sides sever in the next five years, here's the amended money structure.     If fired without cause, UCLA would have to pay Cronin ...     Before April 1, 2026: $22.5 millionBefore April 1, 2027: $18 millionBefore April 1, 2028: $13.5 millionBefore April 1, 2029: $9 millionBefore April 1, 2030: $4.5 millionIf Cronin takes another job, here are his updated buyout terms ...     Before April 1, 2026: $15 millionBefore April 1, 2027: $12 millionBefore April 1, 2028: $8 millionBefore April 1, 2029: $6 millionBefore April 1, 2030: $4 millionThe conditions almost certainly lock up the two sides through the end of the decade. Cronin is 145-67 at UCLA in this his eighth season. He's taken the school to the NCAAs four times, including the 2021 Final Four run in the COVID bubble tourney. The 7-3 Bruins are unranked and face Arizona State on Wednesday night.   Cronin's new deal likely keeps him with UCLA through at least 2029-30. \n                                                                    Orlando Ramirez / Getty Images\n                                                              What does it mean to be last unbeaten mid-major?  I started this week's Court Report writing about one 11-0 team, now let's look at another. The Miami University RedHawks won at Wright State on Tuesday night to reach mid-December without a loss. There are only seven undefeated teams left; Travis Steele's group is the lone mid-major without a scratch. The RedHawks -- who naturally made my preseason Top 100 And 1 teams list -- have done this by playing a terrible schedule. Their difficulty ranks 362 out of 365. Still, every mid-major coach dreams of making it to December without a loss, let alone Christmas. After four seasons of not taking Xavier to the NCAA Tournament, Steele has found a place to thrive in the MAC. This is Year 4 for him in Oxford, Ohio, and it's setting up to be his best season in eight campaigns as a head coach.   Now, what can an 11-0 start get you? More specifically, if you're the last mid-major team to take a loss, what does that portend for your NCAA Tournament chances? Well, over the past 25 seasons, 15 mid-majors that took their first loss last wound up making the Big Dance. That's a 60% hit rate. Last season it was Drake. The year before, James Madison. And both those teams won an NCAA tourney game.   On average since the 2000-01 season, the final mid-major to lose a game finishes with a 26-7 record.   Here are the five best undefeated starts for mid-majors in the past 25 years. If you want the full list, I posted it on Bluesky.  » 2013-14 Wichita State: 35-0, first loss on March 23, finished 35-1 in R2 as No. 1 seed  » 2003-04 Saint Joseph's: 27-0, first loss on March 11, finished 30-2 in E8 as No. 1 seed   » 2011-12 Murray State: 23-0, first loss on Feb. 9, finished 31-2 in R2 as No. 6 seed  » 2010-11 San Diego State: 20-0, first loss on Jan. 26, finished 34-3 in Sweet 16 as No. 2 seed  » 2020-21 Drake: 18-0, first loss on Feb. 7, finished 26-5 in R1 as No. 11 seed  Travis Steele is aiming to get Miami University to win 25 games in back-to-back seasons for the first time ever. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                                                                              Norlander's news + nuggets               • Two weeks ago the Court Report detailed the history-making pace of non-con ranked matchups. At the end of this week, we'll be at 44 ranked-on-ranked games outside of intra-league play. Hitting 50 is a bridge too far, but with Louisville-Baylor, Ohio State-Virginia and Michigan-Duke all happening in February, topping out at 46 or 47 would still be the record, per my research.  • I love that the Big 5 Classic is still a thing. I would prefer for it to always be a thing. College basketball is actually special in Philadelphia. But I also worry that it could be a relic by the end of the decade.  • This didn't exactly fly under the radar, but I don't think it got quite the reaction it deserved last week: Michigan State getting a $400 million infusion for its athletic department is the kind of thing that could vault MSU in the overall college sports hierarchy by the end of the decade. And will be the second most important factor (beyond picking the right successor) in Sparty's chances at staying elite in basketball after Tom Izzo retires, whenever that day comes.   • The most baffling team in the sport is Loyola Chicago. The Ramblers are 3-8, play in California tonight against San Francisco and are under threat for one of their worst seasons ever. This after LUC was expected to be a dark horse candidate to win the Atlantic 10.  • A different early season surprise at the high-major level: UCF. The Knights are 8-1 (best start in 10 seasons under Johnny Dawkins) and will likely get to 11-1 by Christmas. Many agents expected Dawkins to be off the job after last season. Not yet. Still a lot to prove,  though.  • USC is 10-1, but it could be headed for a slide in January. Trojans coach Eric Musselman revealed on Monday that star transfer Rodney Rice (20.3 ppg, 6.0 apg) might be done for the season after injuring his shoulder at the Maui Invitational in late November. This is the exact scenario that coaches stress over when they opt in on paying millions of dollars to transfers amid the portal frenzy. If Rice is done, through no fault of his own, then it's money poorly spent.  • Creighton plays Xavier tonight. The Bluejays are in no man's land. Sitting at 5-5, it's the program's worst start in the first 10 games of a season in 16 years. Will Greg McDermott walk away in March and end it like this?  • I'll take home-and-homes between high-majors no matter what, so that being said: Georgia and North Carolina teaming up is an unexpected combo. They'll play in November of '26 and again November or December of '28.  • Longtime readers know I love tunes just as much as hoops. Here's an interesting article on the best-selling tour acts of the 21st century. If we did this for college basketball, the top ticket sellers since Jan. 1, 2001 (only for the regular season) would be: Kentucky, Syracuse, North Carolina, Louisville and Tennessee.  • Neglected to get this into my column last week when I covered UConn vs. Florida at the Jimmy V. It was of course a matchup of the two most recent national title winners. Since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, we've been treated to a game between the two most recent title winners 21 times. A lot more than I would have guessed, but that's significantly boosted by intra-conference play. What's rare is to have a nonconference regular season battle between those teams. Huskies-Gators was only the fifth such matchup in 40 years. Here's the list in reverse chronological order.  Sixteen of the 21 most recent matchups were intra-league or NCAA Tournament battles. \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            \n            ",

Congratulations to the Knicks on winning the NBA Cup, and farewell to boxing legend Terence Crawford, who chose to ride off into the sunset. We'll have all that and more in today's newsletter, so let's not waste anymore time.  🏆 Five things to know Wednesday The Knicks defeated the Spurs to win the NBA Cup. It's title time in the Big Apple. Down by five going into the fourth quarter of the NBA Cup championship, the Knicks rallied to beat the Spurs in impressive fashion, 124-113. OG Anunoby was the difference for New York as he totaled 28 points, including a dagger 3-pointer in the final quarter, while adding nine rebounds and three assists. Jalen Brunson added 25 points and was named NBA Cup MVP. Now three years into the NBA Cup experience, our Sam Quinn notes what's working and what isn't.Terence \"Bud\" Crawford retires from boxing with perfect 42-0 record. The top pound-for-pound boxer in the world, Crawford was a five-division champion and the undisputed champion at the junior welterweight, welterweight and super middleweight levels. Just months after his unanimous decision victory over Canelo Alvarez, Crawford announced that he is hanging up his gloves for good. He will go out as one of the best boxers of his generation thanks to his untarnished record, which includes 31 knockouts.Arch Manning will return to Texas for the 2026 season. For much of the season, there was little question that Manning would be back with the Horns next year. Then, he surged at the end of the season, even leading Texas to an upset win over No. 3 Texas A&M. That stretch at least left the door open for a jump to the NFL, but Manning will be back for another season in Austin. On a related note, USC quarterback Jayden Maiava is also staying put in the City of Angels.Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love declared for the NFL Draft. One college football star who will not be back in 2026 is Love, who announced he was going to the NFL on Tuesday night. It makes sense for Love, a Heisman Trophy finalist, because he will be one of the top running backs in the 2026 class. In one of our recent mock drafts, Love comes off the board at No. 9 overall to the Cardinals. Love ends his Irish career with 2,882 rushing yards and 36 rushing touchdowns.The ACC is updating its tiebreaker policy after missing out on the College Football Playoff. Who could have seen this  coming? After a 7-5 Duke team reached the ACC title game and won -- eliminating the conference from the playoff -- the league announced it will revise its tiebreaker policy. The details of the new tiebreakers haven't been hammered out yet, but the ACC said they will be laid out prior to the 2026 season. 📈 Do not miss this: Packers plummet in NFL Power Rankings \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            The Packers suffered a tough road loss against the Broncos on Sunday, but it sure felt like more than one defeat. Star pass rusher Micah Parsons tore his ACL, and they also lost key contributors in right tackle Zach Tom and safety Evan Williams. The NFL season is a battle of attrition, and right now the Packers are losing that battle. In Pete Prisco's latest NFL Power Rankings, Green Bay was the biggest faller, sinking five spots to No. 10. Can Green Bay keep it together for a Super Bowl run? Maybe, but it will take something special. Prisco: \"The Packers drop to No. 10 in my power rankings this week after the loss to the Broncos. I picked Green Bay to reach the Super Bowl before the Parsons injury, but these injuries will be tough to overcome. Is it impossible? Not if Jordan Love plays out of his mind and players like Rashan Gary and Lukas Van Ness emerge as dominant edge rushers. But it certainly won't be easy.\"With the Packers and Rams both suffering key injuries in Week 15, the NFC Championship race suddenly opened up a little bit. Can teams like the 49ers, Bears and Seahawks take advantage? \n 🏈 Top 25 players in the College Football Playoff \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            The College Football Playoff kicks off this weekend, and some of the nation's top stars will go head-to-head in the hunt for a national championship. That said, you may as well get familiar with the most important players in the 12-team field. Blake Brockermeyer ranked the 25 most important players in this year's College Football Playoff. It should come as no shock that Heisman Trophy winner Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza takes the top spot, but Oregon signal caller Dante Moore slots in at No. 5. Moore's poise and ability to make plays in a variety of ways will be key for the Ducks. Brockermeyer: \"Moore played like a seasoned veteran, completing 72.5% of his passes on the season. He remained calm under pressure and consistently delivered in clutch situations, recording 24 big-time throws and 24 passing touchdowns. Moore also has the ability to run around or through defenders when plays break down and can create effectively on the move.\"For those worried about another lopsided first round this year, fear not. This weekend's games should all be much more competitive than last year thanks to a key format tweak. In a similar vein, every fan base needs a little hope their team can win it all, so here is how each College Football Playoff team can go the distance.  👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Sienna Betts made her highly-anticipated debut for UCLA and notched five points and two assists.Snoop Dogg will headline NFL Christmas Day halftime show during Vikings-Lions game.Michigan could roll the dice with Biff Poggi, but it would be an enormous risk.Trade season is heating up in the NBA, and here are 100 names that could be on the move.Speaking of which, could the Bucks hang onto Giannis Antetokounmpo and make some win-now moves?Rockets coach Ime Udoka didn't shy away from blasting the refs after a controversial call.Here's how NBA teams can prevent more injuries to all their key big men.Ohio State star Bruce Thornton is on an absolute heater these days.Coach swap: Ole Miss is hiring LSU interim coach Frank Wilson to its staff.Could the Padres move Fernando Tatis Jr. to keep their payroll in check?The Diamondbacks have entered the race to sign Alex Bregman.Napheesa Collier stands by her criticism of the WNBA but says the \"future is bright.\"Nick Saban is in the hockey business after purchasing a stake in the Predators.Former USMNT star Michael Bradley is getting his shot to lead the New York Red Bulls. 📺 What we're watching Wednesday ⚽ We'll be watching the UEFA Women's Champions League all day on Paramount+. \n🏈 Old Dominion vs. USF, 5 p.m. on ESPN 🏀 No. 13 Vanderbilt at Memphis (M), 7 p.m. on ESPN2 🏒 Mammoth at Red Wings, 7:30 p.m. on TNT 🏀 Grizzlies at Timberwolves, 8 p.m. on NBA TV 🏈 Louisiana vs. Delaware, 8:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏒 Devils at Golden Knights, 10 p.m. on TNT \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Looking further ahead, however, the Dodgers -- in keeping with so much of recent history -- may be in the mix for the most coveted free agent of the class. This time around, the New York Post reports that the Dodgers are expected to pursue outfielder Kyle Tucker, who hits the market this winter. \nThe 28-year-old Tucker is coming off a strong season for the Chicago Cubs, who acquired him via four-player trade last December. In 136 games, he put up an OPS+ of 143 with 22 home runs, 25 stolen bases, and a WAR of 4.5. Tucker might have found himself in the National League MVP discussion, but a finger injury followed by a calf strain played a role in his declining numbers later in the season. For his career, the four-time All-Star has an OPS+ of 140 across parts of eight MLB seasons, seven of which came with the Houston Astros. The Dodgers could use an upgrade at a corner outfield spot, and that's especially the case if Teoscar Hernández continues to show signs of offensive decline. This season, Dodger left fielders -- the disappointing Michael Conforto got the bulk of the playing time there -- combined to bat just .229/.317/.385, less than optimal production for such a bat-first position. Tucker would certainly provide a significant upgrade over that (he could man left or Hernández could shift from right to left), and the Dodgers, of course, have the resources and ownership commitment to secure his services – even if the bidding reaches $400 million or more.\nThat said, the competition for Tucker will likely be significant, as he's likely going to be the most hotly pursued free agent of the coming offseason. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Thomas Frank has taken Tottenham by storm with the team in a European spot in the league while also getting the job done in Champions League play. But they've been far from pretty while doing it, relying on set pieces and the defense digging in to find success. It's a marked departure from the team under Ange Postecoglou, while a similar departure has been happening in the front office, where Daniel Levy no longer serves as chairman after stepping down last month.How to watch Tottenham vs. Aston Villa, oddsDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 9 a.m. ETLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium -- LondonTV: USA | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Tottenham +105; Draw +250; Aston Villa +260But while this year of change has started off well for Tottenham, it feels like everything is balanced on a razor's edge. Despite their standing in the Premier League, Tottenham's expected goal difference is -1.39, which is good for 12th in the league. While they've been putting the ball in the back of the net fine, Frank's team has overperformed on the defensive end, allowing five goals from an expected eight.Over the course of the season, things like that can catch up to a team, especially when playing multiple times per week due to Champions League commitments. Improvements in net by starting keeper Guglielmo Vicario can only go so far, but weeks like this one are what can show what Tottenham are made of. \nComing off the international break, they'll have a tough matchup hosting Aston Villa before then travelling away to face Monaco in Champions League play. Needing all three points in both matches, Frank needs to look for more avenues to pull creativity out of his squad. Mohammed Kudus and Pedro Porro are leading the way with 1.85 and 1.30 expected assists to begin the season, respectively, in all competitions, but Xavi Simons has yet to get going.With James Maddison injured, Tottenham's hopes hinge on the Dutchman bringing his form from RB Leipzig to North London, and if it doesn't happen, a long slide down the table could be coming. Goals from Mickey Van De Ven and Richarlison have been able to prop up the team so far, but it's not sustainable. If Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha can't get the ball to the attackers for consistent build-up, Frank may need to fiddle around with things. \nTottenham are riding a fine line, but they've yet to prove that things have improved from last season to a degree that will see them make the Champions League again. This team won't finish 17th in the league again, but if they want to make the top four, an evolution needs to take place in midfield over the next few weeks, or they'll come crashing back to earth.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A chaotic season in the ACC is setting up for a thrilling conference championship race, but for now the team in pole position is Georgia Tech after the Yellow Jackets improved to 7-0 overall and 4-0 in conference play with a 27-18 win at Duke on Saturday afternoon. Brent Key's team is guaranteed to be the only team at 4-0 in league play after Week 8 and lead a handful of contenders to reach the ACC Championship Game by being one of the top two teams in the final conference standings. Georgia Tech being in the mix for an ACC title game appearance is not a huge break from preseason expectations, but the rest of the competition certainly does not fall in line with how experts viewed the conference coming into the year. An outlook of Clemson, Miami and Florida State has been displaced by the likes of Georgia Tech, Virginia and Louisville. The Cardinals made a move into the ACC title picture with an upset of Miami on Friday night that has left Week 8 being among the most significant turning points in the conference championship race. Louisville now has a head-to-head advantage over Miami, and given the imbalanced schedules across a 17-team league any win like that is crucial for all tiebreaker scenarios. Miami is, of course, not out of the mix at all. The Hurricanes may have suffered a disappointing home loss as a two-touchdown favorite but winning out in ACC play and getting some help from a team on Louisville's schedule could very quickly flip what might be an uphill battle to get to Charlotte. And thankfully for Miami, at least when it comes to the College Football Playoff, the team has some quality nonconference wins against Notre Dame, South Florida and Florida that could be necessary to land an at-large bid if the team finds itself shut out of winning the conference. The picture can be expanded even more as SMU and Pittsburgh each have viable paths to making the top two by season's end. Making matters even more complicated is that Georgia Tech, Virginia and Miami have zero crossover games between them to help decide tiebreakers.  \nSo who among the seven teams in the hunt have the best chance to make the ACC Championship Game and play for a spot in the College Football Playoff? We have ranked our top five most likely title game matchups below.\n        \n            \n                After a dominant start to the season, past problems returned to haunt Carson Beck, Miami in loss to Louisville\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n5. Louisville vs. Georgia Tech The primary path for the Cardinals seems to be for Virginia to lose two ACC games before the end of the season and for Louisville to win out in conference play. That would include a strong finish with games against Clemson at home and at SMU in back-to-back weeks to close the ACC schedule. But if Louisville finishes 7-1 in conference play and Virginia slips up a couple of times, that head-to-head win against Miami could put the Cardinals back in the ACC Championship Game for the second time in three years. Here we have Georgia Tech making it through, as the Yellow Jackets have the least amount of work left to finish with an 8-0 or 7-1 league record. 4. Georgia Tech vs. SMU Don't look now but SMU is still very much in the mix for the ACC title after dropping both of its nonconference games against the Big 12 (Baylor, SMU). The Mustangs were the runner-up in the conference last year after going 8-0 in the regular season and again have a path where Rhett Lashlee's group gets to determine its own outcome. That's because SMU gets both Miami and Louisville on its home turf in the second half of the season, and if the Mustangs win them both we will see another surge to the top of the standings. \n3. Miami vs. Virginia This is the scenario where Georgia Tech fumbles the bag, and drops at least one of its final four conference games while Miami wins out and Virginia and secures the right wins to also finish with an 8-0 or 7-1 conference record. For the Yellow Jackets to fall out of the picture they'd need to take at least one loss and likely two from a stretch that includes Syracuse (home), NC State (road), Boston College (road) and Pitt (home). It's a team that's been winning at the margins, especially on the road, so maybe there is some regression there with results and that's what Miami is hoping for so that maybe the NC State game can become a common opponent tiebreaker win for the Canes.   2. Georgia Tech vs. Virginia This is where Miami's loss to Louisville could be doubly painful, because any tiebreakers with Virginia that come down to common opponents would break the Wahoos way because of their win against the Cardinals back in Week 6. Virginia has some tricky cross-country travel to navigate in coming weeks with a Chapel Hill-to-Berkley-to-Charlottesville run starting in Week 9, but if they get through that run, and a mid-November date at Duke, with only one loss then odds are very good the Wahoos can secure the tiebreakers needed to make the conference title game.   1. Miami vs. Georgia Tech Another edition of of Mario Cristobal against Brent Key would make for a highly entertaining ACC Championship Game, and possibly the matchup that would give the ACC the highest probability to get both participants into the College Football Playoff. Of course Miami would need some help to jump ahead of Virginia in the standings, in addition to winning out its final six games of the ACC schedule. Miami will be favored in every game left on the schedule, but now the margin for error has lessened because another conference loss could bounce them from even winning tiebreakers at 6-2.\n            ",

Look no further than Tempe to illustrate that point.No. 7 Texas Tech looked like a true national championship contender ahead of a road showdown against Arizona State. The Red Raiders had beaten Big 12 opponents -- all with winning records -- by an average margin of 24.3 points per game. Arizona State, for its part, was coming off a 32-point road loss to Utah and had won three-point squeakers in its other two Big 12 matchups. Yet down went the Red Raiders: Arizona State 26, Texas Tech 22. The circumstances weren't ideal for Texas Tech, which played without starting quarterback Behren Morton. But the Red Raiders, thanks to the tens of millions they spent in the portal, were supposed to be able to overcome injuries thanks to the depth they created via the transfer market. They were the one Big 12 team that stood above the rest from a talent and depth perspective. But it wasn't enough to beat Arizona State, which put together a game-winning drive in the final minutes to pull the upset, largely thanks to the star duo of quarterback Sam Leavitt and wide receiver Jordyn Tyson. That pair connected four times on the final drive for 55 yards, including a 33-yard completion on fourth down to extend the game. \nThe loss doesn't knock Texas Tech out of the College Football Playoff race, nor does it eliminate its path to Arlington for the Big 12 title game. It does, however, put over half the conference in play to earn a spot in Arlington. That is not an exaggeration.BYU and Cincinnati are the only Big 12 teams without a loss, and the Cougars have one of the toughest games of the season on Saturday night against Utah. \nThere's a real chance that by Sunday morning Cincinnati, which draws Oklahoma State this week, will be alone atop the league -- just like everyone expected. Look at all the team's that will have two or fewer losses in conference play ahead of Week 9: BYU Texas Tech Cincinnati Houston Utah Arizona State Iowa State TCU Baylor Kansas State KansasThat's 11 teams! Only the SEC can claim anything close to that sort of parity. But even that league still has teams that are expected to separate. Georgia and Alabama's talent usually wins out in the end. \nBut now that Texas Tech has a loss, everyone in the Big 12 looks beatable. Cincinnati posted wins in the final minutes over Kansas and Iowa State. BYU has one-possession wins over Colorado and Arizona. The Sun Devils, as mentioned before, have a pair of one-possession wins over TCU and Baylor. Everyone is vulnerable. Everyone is a contender. Texas Tech's loss does, however,  put the Big 12 in danger of being a one-bid league for the playoff. Even if Texas Tech runs the table -- still very possible -- it seems likely whoever else makes it to the Big 12 championship game will have at least two losses, and a three-loss Big 12 runner-up is not getting into a 12-team bracket. But that's a concern for later if you're Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark. For now, the Big 12 is the most competitive and unpredictable autonomy league in a season nation-wide that's already been defined by parity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        At almost every Power Four program in the country, Ohio State star Carnell Tate would be the clear-cut No. 1 wide receiver on his team. The only places he might have competition for that title are at Arizona State (Jordyn Tyson), USC (Makai Lemon) and Ohio State (Jeremiah Smith).Smith has been labeled as a can't-miss prospect from the moment he played his first game at Ohio State last year -- and rightfully so. Smith is clearly on track to be the WR1 in the 2027 NFL Draft and has a strong case as the best player in the sport regardless of position.But don't forget about Tate, who is establishing himself as the most underappreciated star in college football. Tate finished with six catches for 111 yards and two touchdowns in the No. 1 Buckeyes' 34-0 win over Wisconsin on Saturday, which marked his third game this season with at least 100 receiving yards.\nTate, a former five-star recruit from the 2023 class, was competing for targets as a freshman with a wide receiver corps that included Marvin Harrison Jr., Emeka Egbuka and Julian Fleming. Still, he finished the 2023 campaign with 18 catches for 264 yards and a touchdown.\nDuring Ohio State's run to a national title last season, Tate took a giant leap and established himself as a go-to target for quarterback Will Howard. He ended the 2024 campaign with 52 receptions for 733 yards and four touchdowns -- which included catching seven passes for 87 yards against Texas in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl.This season has been a different story for Tate. Through Ohio State's first seven games, he has caught 34 passes for 587 yards and six touchdowns -- which is already a new season-high with plenty of games still to play. Despite an overall resume that may not include eye-popping numbers like some of his peers elsewhere, Tate is making the case to be one of the top wide receivers selected this spring.In CBS Sports' latest mock draft by Ryan Wilson, Tate is projected No. 19 overall to the Cleveland Browns. CBS Sports' Mike Renner had Tate in Tier 1 with Tyson on the wide receiver prospect pecking order for the 2026 NFL Draft, and said he has the \"makings of a high-volume X-receiver\" in the NFL.\nCarnell Tate might go down as one of the least-heralded top-10 picks at receiver in recent memory. Such is life when your former teammate is rookie sensation Emeka Egbuka and your current teammate is generational talent Jeremiah Smith. But Tate has all the makings of a high-volume X-receiver at the next level. His body type and smooth athleticism are more reminiscent of an NBA slasher than a traditional wideout -- and that's what makes him special.And with the history of what Ohio State wide receivers have done at the next level, how could you not bet on the pedigree? Egbuka, who finished as Ohio State's all-time leader in receptions (205), took somewhat of a backseat role to Smith last year. Still, he finished with 81 catches for 1,011 yards and 10 touchdowns and would've been in the same position Tate is in today: The WR2 at his school, and the No. 1 almost everywhere else.That's why when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted Egbuka to join a loaded wide receiver corps that included veteran Chris Godwin Jr. and Mike Evans, it was nothing new for him. Immediately, Egbuka has established himself as one of the best wide receivers in the league as a rookie. He has 27 catches for 469 yards and five touchdowns in six games and has the second-best odds behind New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart, per FanDuel, to win Offensive Rookie of the Year.What Egbuka has done so far could be Tate's reality one day. It doesn't matter that he's technically Ohio State's \"WR2\" because he is capable of being the No. 1 option on any given Saturday -- and the top option on a team on Sundays one day. Any program would be lucky to have Smith or Tate on their roster. It just so happens that Ohio State has both. It's part of the reason why the Buckeyes are currently the clear favorite (+280) to win the national title. Tate, unlike Smith, had to wait his turn to be the guy at Ohio State. So did Egbuka, Harrison, Jaxson Smith-Njigba, Garrett Wilson and other former Buckeyes who are now among the best players at the position in the NFL. The future for Tate is bright, and he is someone worthy of the title as one of the best and most underappreciated players in the sport.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in a long time, there has been genuine excitement around the Denver Broncos and their full capabilities. After returning to the playoffs for the first time in nearly a decade last season, the Broncos have started this campaign by putting up a 4-2 record, which has been built largely thanks to their current three-game winning streak. Under coach Sean Payton, the Broncos have built one of the NFL's fiercest and most punishing defenses, but the introduction of stability at quarterback through 2024 first round pick Bo Nix has been a key ingredient in Denver's success.In some ways, the Broncos' lead is one that the New York Giants are trying to follow. After naming 2025 first round pick Jaxson Dart their starting quarterback, the Giants have won two of their last three games and are coming off one of their biggest wins in years, having dominated their longtime tormentors in the Philadelphia Eagles thanks to the play of Dart as well as rookie running back Cam Skattebo. Despite a 2-4 record, the Giants have begun to show what they can be capable of on their best days, as the energy Dart & Skattebo have infused into the offense has complemented a ferocious Big Blue pass rush very well.Bet Giants vs. Broncos at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:With their eyes towards making potential runs into what lies beyond mid-October, the Broncos and Giants will meet this Sunday at Mile High for a Week 7 matchup pitting two of the NFL's most prominent upstarts against each other.\nWhere to watch Broncos vs. Giants liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETWhere: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -7; O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings)Broncos vs. Giants: Need to knowGreat on great. One of the keys to the dominance of Denver's defense has been the emergence of linebacker Nik Bonitto as not just one of the best young pass rushers in the NFL, but also a potential Defensive Player of the Year candidate. After earning Pro Bowl and Second-Team All-Pro honors as a rookie in 2024, Bonitto currently leads the NFL with eight sacks and has recorded sacks in four games in a row, including the Broncos' nine sack performance last week against the New York Jets. However, Bonitto hasn't reckoned with an offensive lineman quite like Giants left tackle Andrew Thomas, who has greatly elevated Big Blue's line since he returned to the lineup in Week 3 after recovering from a Lisfranc injury suffered a season ago. Thomas has returned to playing at an All-Pro level, as he has been dominant on tape and not allowed a single pressure in 86 pass-blocking snaps according to PFF. The Bonitto-Thomas matchup could go a long way towards deciding this game, and Broncos left tackle Garett Bolles also projects to have his hands full with a Giants pass rush featuring another prospective Defensive Player of the Year candidate in Brian Burns, who boasts seven sacks already this season.Giants defensive changeup. After repeated lapses early in the season by the Giants defense, defensive coordinator Shane Bowen had been the subject of great criticism for running a vanilla scheme lacking in both disguises and aggression alike. But against the Eagles, the Giants defense suddenly played a much more dynamic and aggressive game, a change which apparently occurred after its players pushed Bowen to do so. It worked wonders, as the Giants stifled a star-studded Eagles offense by stopping the run, forcing two takeaways, and holding them to just 1 of 9 on third down. Should Bowen continue to call his defense that way, the Giants' dominance could carry over into this week, as the Broncos' offense was held largely in check and limited to just 13 points and 246 total yards by the Jets just a week ago.\nBroncos vs. Giants prediction, pick\nDespite the Giants' victory over the Super Bowl champion Eagles, oddsmakers continue to lean heavily in the Broncos favor as Denver is favored by -7 in this matchup. Despite that, the spark that Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo have been for the Giants opens up a world of week-to-week possibilities for them, including this week considering how the Broncos looked far from unbeatable against the lowly Jets. For the first time in some time, it feels like anything is possible for the Giants, including this week. Pick: Giants +7; Under 40.5\n            ",

In those prior instances, Jacksonville has gone 5-5 at the facility, but the team is 7-6 all time in international games. Meanwhile, the Rams are 2-2 in their four international regular-season games. Both clubs come into Week 7 with a 4-2 record and fighting for first place in their respective divisions. For the Rams, they are looking to win their second game in a row after taking down the Ravens, but will have to do so without star wideout Puka Nacua, who is sidelined due to an ankle injury. As for the Jaguars, they are looking to bounce back from an upset loss at home to the Seattle Seahawks. Before we jump further into this matchup, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this international contest.Where to watch Rams vs. Jaguars liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 9:30 a.m. ETLocation: Wembley Stadium (London)TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Odds: Rams -3, O/U 44.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet NFL Week 7 games and NFL odds at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Click here to get started.   \nKey questions\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Who will step up in Puka Nacua's absence? Nacua suffered an ankle injury in last week's win over the Ravens and has since been ruled out for Sunday's matchup. Naturally, this is a massive blow to Los Angeles' offense as Nacua's 54 receptions led the NFL while his 616 yards receiving were the second most. Davante Adams will ascend as the No. 1 option for Matthew Stafford, and the veteran is currently averaging 15.2 yards per reception (career high) coming into Week 7. Beyond Adams, receivers Jordan Whittington and Tutu Atwell could see a bump in targets, along with running back Kyren Williams and tight end Tyler Higbee. Will Los Angeles' unusual travel plans hinder its performance? The most common practice for teams taking part in these international games has been for them to arrive earlier in the week to get acclimated to the time change. However, the Rams are taking a different approach. They are arriving in London on Saturday morning, just a day before they kick off their matchup with Jacksonville. It'll be interesting to see if jet lag becomes a factor early in this matchup for Los Angeles. Has Brian Thomas Jr. turned a corner? It was a quiet start for the Jaguars promising second-year receiver, catching just 12 passes for 164 yards through the first month. However, Thomas Jr. has started to look like his old self. In his last two games, he has either matched or exceeded that prior production, posting 12 catches for 170 yards to go along with a receiving touchdown. If this is a sign that the 2024 first-round pick is coming into form, it'll make Jacksonville's offense that much more challenging for the Rams secondary. Will the dam break on the Jacksonville offensive line? Trevor Lawrence was sacked seven times during last week's loss to the Seahawks, which was a season high. Lawrence had been sacked a total of six times combined before Week 6. If leaks are starting to drip along the Jaguars offensive line, the offense could be in for a rude awakening against the Rams front. Los Angeles boasts a pass-rushing duo of Byron Young and Jared Verse that can wreck games at a moment's notice. Young has 7.5 sacks (second-most in the NFL) on the year, while Verse has 31 pressures (third-most). X factor\nMatthew Stafford has been dialed in through the early portion of the season and enters Week 7 as the league leader in passing yards per game (280.7). In the last three games in particular, Stafford has kept the football out of harm's way with zero interceptions over that stretch, while tossing seven touchdowns to go along with a 315.0 passing yards per game average. Jacksonville is allowing 256.3 passing yards per game this season (bottom five in the NFL), so Stafford should continue to have success through the air, even without Nacua in the fold. However, where he may run into trouble is in the turnover department. The Jags lead the NFL with 14 takeaways this season, which includes 10 interceptions. So, this is a strength vs. strength matchup, and whoever wins the turnover battle will most likely win the game. Rams vs. Jaguars prediction, pick\nWhile the travel quirk and the absence of Nacua scare me a bit, I still think this is a game Los Angeles should pull out. I have my questions about Lawrence, and if the offensive line is in the midst of a slump, Jared Verse and Co. could completely stifle the offense. Meanwhile, the Rams offense has enough playmakers to get by for a game without Nacua, albeit with him being arguably the best receiver in the NFL. While Nacua's absence is the most notable, don't sleep on Jacksonville being without Devin Lloyd. The linebacker leads the NFL with five takeaways this year, which slows one of the key strengths of the Jaguars defense. \nPrediction: Rams 24, Jaguars 20 | Rams -3, Under 44.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers can cross one item off of their checklist this Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals. If they can defeat the struggling Cardinals, the Packers will get their first road victory of the season after losing in Cleveland in Week 3 and tying the Cowboys in Dallas in Week 4. After not winning either of their last two games before their Week 5 bye, the Packers got back to their winning ways last Sunday, defeating the Bengals behind a big performance by Josh Jacobs, who scored two touchdowns while tallying 150 all-purpose yards. Bet Cardinals vs. Packers at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Speaking of a win, the Cardinals haven't had one of those in quite some time. After a 2-0 start, Arizona has dropped four straight one-possession games that includes last week's four-point loss to the surging Colts, who were spearheaded by running back Jonathan Taylor's 123 yards that included the game-winning score. \nHere's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. Where to watch Packers vs. Cardinals liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Arizona TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -6.5; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Packers vs. Cardinals: Need to know The Cardinals are on the mend. Injuries have been one of the biggest reasons for the Cardinals' current four-game skid. But while the Cardinals had 12 players on this week's injury report, many of those players appear to be trending up in terms of their current injury situations. Among those players is Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, who missed Arizona's Week 6 loss with a foot injury, but started the week as a limited practice participant. So did Cardinals second-year receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., who exited last Sunday's loss and was placed in the league's concussion protocol. Staying on schedule. While they are roughly average in most major categories, the Cardinals have been very good on both sides of the ball on third down. Arizona's offense is sixth in the NFL on third down, while it's defense is currently ranked seventh. Green Bay has actually been even better on third down this season, as they are first on offense and sixth on defense on third down. \nThe power of Love. Packers quarterback Jordan Love appears to be primed for a big game as the Cardinals' defense is currently 28th in the NFL in passing yards allowed. Love has been extremely accurate this season; he's completed at least 72% of his throws in all but four of his five starts. Packers have a big edge. Green Bay has a sizable advantage when it comes to the running game. Jacobs is coming off his best game of the season and appears primed for his first 100-yard game of the 2025 campaign. Conversely, the Cardinals has yet to fill the void left by James Conner's season-ending injury. Murray is currently the Cardinals' leading rusher with 175 yards. Packers vs. Cardinals prediction, pick \nArizona is better than its record, but until they prove that they can close out games, it's going to be hard to pick them in any game, especially one where they are a clear underdog. The Packers should win this one while leaning on their Pro Bowl running back. Pick: Packers -6.5; Over 44.5\n            ",

And that's where we come in to lend a helping hand. Below, you can find our five best bets for Week 7 that include a pick in the Eagles-Vikings matchup, along with determining if the Kansas City Chiefs -- re-armed with wideout Rashee Rice -- can cover the double-digit spread against the Las Vegas Raiders.

They are also facing a Titans team playing their first game after firing head coach Brian Callahan, which is typically a situation where clubs respond well the following game. That said, is Mike Vrabel really going to lose his first game against a Tennessee franchise that fired him after the 2023 season? The Patriots head coach should be dialed in for this matchup, and I expect the players in the locker room will also be motivated to win this game for Vrabel. \nNew England is also far superior -- it's playing like a top 10 team in the NFL at the moment -- with Drake Maye putting up top five numbers at the quarterback position.  On the other side, Cam Ward has struggled as the No. 1 overall pick: he has a league-worst 55% completion rate and ranks bottom three in the league in yards per attempt (5.5) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (3-to-4). Going up against a New England defense that is 3-0 and allowing just 17.3 points per game since All-Pro corner Christian Gonzalez returned, it could be another long day at the office for Tennessee. Projected score: Patriots 30, Titans 17The pick: Patriots -7New Orleans Saints at Chicago Bears (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)I think Caleb Williams is going to be particularly motivated for this game against New Orleans and, more specifically, Spencer Rattler. This will be the first time these former Oklahoma quarterbacks will face one another since their position battle with the Sooners. Rattler started over Williams to begin the 2020 season, but Williams eventually got the nod during the sixth game of that campaign. Williams started the rest of that year, and Rattler eventually transferred to South Carolina. Williams admitted in 2024 that he was \"so angry\" starting the season as the backup to Rattler at the time, and I wonder if that feeling will linger in this game with a desire to continue to prove that he was the top quarterback in that room. On top of the motivation factor from Williams, I like the way Chicago is playing. It has won three straight coming into Week 7 and is averaging 2.4 takeaways per game (most in the NFL). That should match up well against Rattler's Saints, with the quarterback 0-5 on the road as the starter and his offense averaging just 11.8 points per game. Meanwhile, Williams is 7-3-1 ATS at home in his career. \nProjected score: Bears 27, Saints 20The pick: Bears -4.5\n        \n            \n                NFL Week best bets: Mike Vrabel wins revenge game vs. Titans, Dillon Gabriel scores first win\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPhiladelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)It's hard for me to back the Eagles at this stage, particularly on the road. The offense continues to look lost and is averaging just 274.5 yards per game (third-fewest in the NFL). The club has been outgained in every game this season and has been outscored 52-17 in the last five quarters. This offense is expected to rebound against a Vikings defense that is fifth in the NFL in points per game allowed (19.4), sixth in yards per game allowed (289.8), and second in third-down efficiency (30%)? I don't see it. Meanwhile, the Vikings are 9-2 at home since the start of last season, which includes a 2-0 record as a home underdog. The club is 4-1 straight up as an underdog since 2024. Projected score: Vikings 23, Eagles 20The pick: Vikings +1.5Carolina Panthers at New York Jets (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)The Jets initially opened as the favorite in this matchup, but the odds have swung toward Carolina. While it's hard to fault anyone for fading the Jets after an abysmal performance in London last week, this is a sneaky good spot for them to notch their first win of 2025. The Panthers are a dramatically different team on the road than they are at home. This season, Carolina is 0-3 on the road and is averaging just 15 points per game on offense while allowing 31.7 points per game on defense. Bryce Young is just 1-15 on the road in his career as a starter. If this continues, Justin Fields won't be asked to do anything beyond his capabilities as a passer, and New York could control a low-scoring game. \nAfter all, the Jets did play well on defense and on special teams last week, to the point where they nearly pulled off the upset despite issues on offense. Those two areas could continue to shine, and if they get remotely competent play from Fields and Co., it'll result in the first win for head coach Aaron Glenn. Projected score: Jets 20, Panthers 17The pick: Jets +1.5Las Vegas Raiders at Kansas City Chiefs (-11.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)Don't look now, but the Kansas City Chiefs have clawed back to .500, the offense is coming alive, and the team is set to welcome back standout receiver Rashee Rice from his six-game suspension. K.C. has gone 3-1 since beginning the year at 0-2 and takes on a Raiders team that hasn't impressed at all this season, despite bringing in veteran quarterback Geno Smith and respected head coach Pete Carroll. Smith has an NFL-high 10 interceptions and the offense is averaging just 17.2 points per game (29th in the league). That won't be good enough against a Chiefs offense that is starting to heat up and is getting a key weapon back in the fold. That's also not mentioning Patrick Mahomes' 12-2 record against the Raiders in his career. I expect Kansas City to cover the double-digit spread. \nProjected score: Chiefs 33, Raiders 21The pick: Chiefs -11.5Odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

Now, right after they fired their coach, the Titans are hosting their former coach who is in the process of turning a team around, something Tennessee fans may find difficult to watch.Drake Maye makes history. Drake Maye joined elite company last week when he joined Patrick Mahomes and Dan Marino are the only quarterbacks under 24 to record at least 200 passing yards and a passer rating of over 100 in five straight games. Maye looks like the real deal and he's only strengthening his bond with his receivers. Heading into Week 7, Maye has 1,522 yards, 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions. Cam Ward may have a challenging day. Ward joined a long list of other first overall selections who had their coach fired midseason. Ward is only a few games into his NFL career, but that doesn't mean people don't expect him to be a star already. Immediate success has become something demanded in the league, but Ward will likely need more time. The 2025 No. 1 overall pick has yet to prove whether he can be \"the guy\" for Tennessee as his stat line -- 55.5 completion percentage, 1,101 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions -- would indicate. This defense will not be an easy one for Ward to face and with Calvin Ridley's health in question, it could be a long day for the offense.\nTitans vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThe Patriots have the benefit of facing a team in their first week with an interim coach. While this firing should light a fire in the Titans' locker room, the Patriots have the clear upper hand. I expect Maye to continue his impressive campaign and put up solid numbers this year. Pick: Patriots -7, Over 42.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        For the second straight campaign, Lionel Messi is closing out the season on a high note with a hat trick as Inter Miami defeated Nashville SC 5-2 on Saturday night. Due to FC Cincinnati also winning on Decision Day, that means that the Herons can't climb above third in the Eastern Conference and will set them up for a rematch facing Nashville in a best-of-three series in the opening round.With Messi scoring a hat trick and Sam Surridge also scoring for Nashville, that could be a blockbuster of a playoff series as Miami will have the added mental boost of defeating Nashville to close out the season. Not only has Lionel Messi likely secured the Golden Boot with his 29th goal on the season (Denis Bouanga would need five to catch him for Los Angeles FC as he has 24 currently), but he has also likely secured a second consecutive league MVP award with his 19th assist alongside that (including secondary assists). It's the second-best single-season goal contribution season behind only Carlos Vela's 34 goals and 15 assists in 2019, which shows the historic nature of what we're experiencing watching the Argentine number 10.\nThe season hasn't gone according to plan for Miami as they've yet to win a knockout tournament, but winning the MLS Cup would be able to turn things into a success for Javier Mascherano and the Herons. After being knocked out in the MLS Cup playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United last season, which caused an entire overhaul of the team and the coaching staff, getting past Nashville will be critical. \nFor anything that Miami want to do, Messi will be critical to it as they'll look to send Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba into retirement on the right foot. They're quite familiar with B.J. Callaghan's Nashville side, having squared off six times since the beginning of 2024. They've played in pressure scenarios with the Herons, defeating Nashville in the 2023 Leagues Cup final to win the tournament and getting past Nashville in the knockouts of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup. Nashville will be aware of that history and looking to do the domestic double after winning the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup for the first time in their history, so the winner of this series will be a formidable opponent for whoever they face in the knockout rounds, but get the popcorn ready because this will be worth watching.\nThe first round of the MLS Cup playoffs will take place from Oct. 24 to Nov. 9, giving both teams a bit of time to rest. Miami will host the first and last matches, with the middle fixture being in Nashville, and the first team to two wins will advance to the conference semifinals.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In the Week 7 edition of \"Sunday Night Football,\" the San Francisco 49ers play host to the Atlanta Falcons. San Francisco comes into this game having lost two of its last three. The 49ers are starting backup quarterback Mac Jones, who will be making his fifth appearance in seven games in place of Brock Purdy. The Niners are getting somewhat healthier with the return of star tight end George Kittle, but they also remain banged up on both sides of the ball thanks to numerous injuries to their offensive skill-position corps and the dual losses of Nick Bosa and Fred Warner on defense. They're in first place in the NFC West at the moment, but also in danger of falling behind due to their health issues. Atlanta is coming off one of the most impressive wins of the season, having defeated the Bills on Monday night. The Falcons, who improved to 3-2 with that victory, have been powered by a surprisingly-effective defense complemented by the Bijan Robinson's-led run game. Atlanta is looking to keep pace in the NFC South with the 5-1 Buccaneers, and needs to continue stacking wins in order to do so.Will the Niners bounce back, or will the Falcons pull off another upset? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Falcons liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 19 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -2.5, O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet 49ers vs. Buccaneers and other NFL games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.When the Falcons have the ball\nAtlanta's offense has strong overall numbers -- the Falcons are second in the NFL in total yards per game -- but has been inconsistent and also struggled to score. The Falcons' 20 points per game is sixth-lowest in the league.A lot of that is because they got shut out in Week 3 against the Panthers, but they've also just been inconsistent in areas where you need to be consistent in order to score: They've turned just seven of their 16 red-zone trips into touchdowns, giving them the sixth-lowest red-zone conversion rate in the league. They've instead been somewhat dependent on big plays to generate end-zone trips: Robinson's two touchdowns of 50 or more yards account for 20% of Atlanta's total offensive scores. \nMichael Penix Jr. has been a primary source of inconsistency. He was dreadful in that game against Carolina, averaging 4.8 yards per attempt and throwing a pair of interceptions. He didn't play well against the Vikings in Week 2, either. But he did well to go shot-for-shot with Baker Mayfield in Week 1, looked good except for an interception against the Commanders in Week 4 and handled himself quite nicely last week against the Bills. Depending on which Penix you get in any given week, that can go a long way toward determining what this Atlanta offense looks like. \nThe basis of the offense, though, remains the run game. Robinson has finally added the explosive plays to go with his sparkling efficiency, and he's now averaging 5.8 yards per carry on the year. Among the 36 running backs with 50-plus carries, Robinson ranks seventh in rushing success rate, via Tru Media, as well as second in the share of his runs that gained five or more yards (44.6%) and first in both avoided-tackle rate and yards after contact per attempt.The 49ers rank 19th in rushing success rate allowed, per Tru Media, but they've done a good job of limiting yards after contact thanks to mostly strong tackling. If they can keep Robinson to medium gains rather than allowing large chunks when he sheds tackles, they have a chance to somewhat contain the rushing attack.\nWith Warner out, the area over the middle of the field should be easier to attack in the passing game. That's the area the Falcons like to attack with in-breaking routes, especially with Drake London and tight end Kyle Pitts. We don't yet know whether Darnell Mooney, who missed last week's game, will play after he was limited in practice all week. London is likely to be heavily targeted either way, but if Mooney is out, he could be a target vacuum as he has been for Penix whenever the No. 2 receiver has missed time. San Francisco is 30th in opponents' passing success rate, so the Falcons should have some opportunities to get going through the air here.When the 49ers have the ballAtlanta's defense has been one of the biggest surprises of the season. Expected to be one of the worst units in the NFL, the Falcons have instead been one of the best. They check in first in yards allowed per game, seventh in points allowed per game, first in FTN's DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) and tied for fifth in EPA per play at Tru Media. Basically, they have been a clear-cut top-five unit. \nThe strength of the unit has been against the pass, where the Falcons have allowed the third-lowest opponents' success rate. Atlanta has shockingly registered a 41.8% pressure rate that ranks sixth-best in the NFL, and has done it by blitzing like crazy: defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich has sent extra rushers on a preposterous 48.7% of opponent dropbacks, per Tru Media. Those blitzes have also been ultra-effective: when they've blitzed, the Falcons allowed only a 54.8% completion rate and 6.4 yards per attempt, and they've given up explosive plays at half the league-average rate. \nIn this game, the Falcons will be going up against San Francisco backup Mac Jones. Jones has been effective filling in for Brock Purdy this season, completing 67.3% of his passes at an average of 7.5 yards per attempt, with six touchdowns and three interceptions in his four games. \nHe has, though, been highly susceptible to pressure, which is not surprising given his history. He's eighth in EPA per dropback from a clean pocket, via Tru Media, and 31st (out of 34 qualifiers) when under pressure. And again, the Falcons have gotten pressure at one of the highest rates in the league. Jones himself has only been pressured 29.1% of the time, the third-lowest rate in the NFL, because he's been getting the ball out in an average of just 2.62 seconds. If he can get the ball out before the rush has a chance to get home, he can potentially find some success here. But Atlanta's coverage unit has been sticky, which has in turn played into that high pressure rate. If the Falcons can muddy the pocket, they have a chance to force Jones into a bad game. While the Falcons have been stingy through the air, they have been highly vulnerable on the ground. They're second-to-last (ahead of only the Cowboys) in opponents' rushing success rate, via Tru Media, and have yielded 4.8 yards per carry. A lot of that has been about yards before contact, which is unsurprising given the body types the Falcons have up front (lighter and faster as opposed to bigger and stronger). Opponents are averaging 1.89 yards before contact per attempt.\nUnfortunately for the Niners, they have been extremely unsuccessful running the ball this season. Christian McCaffrey is averaging a mere 3.1 yards per tote and has only one rushing score. His best game on the ground saw him average 4.2 yards a pop against the Saints back in Week 2. Fortunately for San Francisco, help is on the way. Kittle is the best blocking tight end in the NFL and a key piece in making the team's run game work. If he's healthy enough to play, he should be healthy enough to help get the run game going here against a unit that is very soft against the run.Prediction\nThe Falcons do have some matchup advantages here, particularly in the run game on offense. But their excellent defense does have some potential areas that it can be exploited, particularly if you can get the ball out quickly and scheme playmakers into open space. Few play-callers do that better than Kyle Shanahan, and the combination of McCaffrey and Kittle working over the middle of the field can make some stuff happen. If the Niners can limit Robinson's explosive runs, I like them to pull this one out at home. Pick: 49ers 23, Falcons 20\n            ",

The Mariners have solved Tarik Skubal three times in four tries this season, including twice at home.

George Kirby has always pitched better at home (3.10 ERA) than on the road (4.14) over his four-year career. Skubal is a \"beast\" who has logged 209.3 IP this season.

Seattle also hit Skubal well during the regular season, scoring four runs over his five innings in a 12-3 Mariners win in July, so a Seattle offense with stars such as Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodriguez shouldn't be intimidated on Friday. Mariners starter George Kirby held the Tigers to two runs in five innings with eight strikeouts in Game 1.<strong> The model projects the Mariners to win in 60% of simulations.</strong></p><p><strong>More MLB best bets</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Every MLB game simulated 10,000 times</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20251010_DET@SEA/\" target=\"_blank\">Tigers vs. Mariners picks from the SportsLine Projection Model</a></li></ul><h3>Friday college football best bets <br /></h3><ul><li><strong>Game: South Florida vs. North Texas (Friday, 7:30 p.m. ET)</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: North Texas (-110)</strong></li></ul><p>\"While USF has just as much talent on both sides of the ball, the Mean Green has greatly improved since last season, especially defensively,\" <strong>said SportsLine expert Bob Konarski, who is 4-1 (+275) over his last five college football money line picks</strong>. \"Their level of competition hasn't been as strong as USF and the defense has limited their opponents' passing attack to less than 150 yards per game so far. Drew Mestemaker has thrown 11 touchdowns and has yet to throw an interception.

That hasn't been the case over the last two weeks in Big Ten play, combining to go Under this total in three of their four contests. They also went well Under this total in last year's meeting, resulting in a 21-18 Rutgers victory.

His five receiving touchdowns in five games are tied for the second-most in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> as well as his single-season career of five he set back in 2023. </p><p>\"I'll probably say just one day at a time, but most definitely like you said, it's a career high. All I can say is the guys, Dak, young o-line [are] stepping up. Because it's my first year [here], so they're helping me out as well,\" Pickens said on Wednesday.</p><p> Another narrative about Pickens centered around his perceived immaturity and bad attitude in Pittsburgh with Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin publicly ripping the now-24-year-old last season and declaring he <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/steelers-mike-tomlin-acknowledges-that-george-pickens-has-to-grow-up-after-costly-penalties-vs-bengals/\" target=\"_blank\">needed to \"grow up.\"</a> That's not the Pickens that has shown up in Dallas. </p>\n<p>\"I would just say with him, he [Pickens] brings the energy man,\" Cowboys All-Pro kick returner and return man <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180870/kavontae-turpin/\">KaVontae Turpin</a> said Wednesday. \"Everybody says he's this type of guy, but I say he's a goofy guy, man. He's always smiling and always wants to make sure everybody else is smiling. So that's my guy. We're always trying to make everybody smile in the building.\"</p><p>Catching five touchdowns in five games and the Cowboys being off to a 2-2-1 start to the season has Pickens in a great mood through the first quarter of the season. </p><p>\"I feel like I'm having fun. That's the thing, I feel like I was always having fun. I just feel like the narrative never showed me having fun,\" Pickens said. \"I feel like right now it's a good thing for the team.\"   </p>\n<p>Being able to essentially speak touchdowns into existence with Dallas is also pretty fun. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a> told Pickens to just run deep in the huddle at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">Jets</a> in Week 5, and that's exactly what he did as Prescott hit him for a 43-yard bomb of a touchdown on Jets All-Pro cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3120997/sauce-gardner/\">Sauce Gardner</a>. </p><p>\"Yeah, a lot of hand fighting, knowing he was going to try to hold and grab a lot, so I was definitely trying to not get caught up in that mid-route. It was a post route, kind of got him off the release, and then Dak put the ball up,\" Pickens said. ... \"Definitely trying to get a step on him [Gardner] because we know he can't, he has a hard time playing the ball in the air. ... I think we had a drive before that, we wanted to score then, but we went three-and-out. So when we got back out there, it was definitely like 'let's put up another one.'\"</p>\n<p>A year ago, it would have been unfathomable for Dallas to score 77 points in a two-game span with All-Pro wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> sidelined with a sprained ankle. That's exactly what's happened the last two weeks in large part to Pickens assuming the mantle as Dallas' No. 1 option. Across the last two weeks, Pickens co-led the NFL with three receiving touchdowns and his 191 yards receiving yards were the sixth-most in the league across Weeks 4 and 5. </p>\n<p>\"Confidence is high. When you add a guy like George and guys who are just getting older, more experienced, whether it be [tight end Jake] Ferg[uson] or [KaVontae] Turp[in] or [Jalen] Tolbert then you got a guy like [Ryan] Flo[urnoy] that comes in and contributes like he does. It's just exciting,\" Prescott said on Thursday. \"It's exciting to understand, and when you get them all back, how many weapons you're gonna have. Once again, there's only one ball. So I think for the good part about it, right, is some guys can get their egos fed out, and get back into it later. Understand that this thing's truly just about winning, and everybody's number gets called, just who knows what day it is. ... When you're doing things right, you're playing the right way, and you're helping this team, you're going to have success.\"  </p>\n            </div>",

These were the quarterbacks that started for the Giants following the retirement of Eli Manning. These were a long, dark five years, but it appears the Giants may have found a franchise quarterback.</p>\n<h3>True or false: Did Cam Skattebo top Odell Beckham Jr.?</h3>\n<p>Skattebo is not the fastest running back in the world nor the biggest, but he may be the most competitive. And definitely the most entertaining. He's quickly becoming a fan favorite, and not just among Giants fans. He runs like he wants to hurt would-be tacklers, and is a bowling ball that desperately wants to reach the end zone so he can do backflips.</p><p>The No. 105 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is just the second rookie since 1970 to rack up 100 scrimmage yards vs. the reigning Super Bowl champions, joining <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2079567/kareem-hunt/\">Kareem Hunt</a> in 2017. He's the first Giants rookie to rush for three touchdowns in a single game since Charlie Evans in 1971, and the first NFL rookie since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2960976/antonio-gibson/\">Antonio Gibson</a> in 2020 to do so. </p><p>Skattebo is the fourth player since 2000 to have 300 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards and five rushing touchdowns in their first six career games. He actually has more scrimmage yards than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824823/odell-beckham-jr/\">Odell Beckham Jr</a>. did in his first six career games. So this is true as well. </p>\n            </div>",

Even amid Philadelphia's 4-0 start, the Eagles faced questioned about their ability to move the ball with a disjointed passing attack and a rushing approach that looked significantly less explosive than it did last season. </p><p>That criticism is only growing louder as Philadelphia has stumbled to two consecutive losses over the last five days. Its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/giants-eagles-live-updates-score-highlights-thursday-night-football/live/\" target=\"_blank\">latest setback was a 34-17 defeat</a> at the hands of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> team that entered \"Thursday Night Football\" with a 1-4 record. </p><p>The Eagles scored just 34 points combined over the last two weeks, and they have failed to eclipse 20 points in half of their games thus far. Even before the current losing skid, Eagles wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2258303/a-j-brown/\">A.J. Brown</a> <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-a-j-brown-posts-cryptic-message-after-another-quiet-game-if-youre-not-welcomed-quietly-withdraw/\" target=\"_blank\">posted a cryptic Bible verse on social media</a></span> that seemed to suggest discontentment towards the current offensive situation. He later denied that the post was directed at anyone associated with Philadelphia. </p><p>Still, both quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> and running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> claimed that they met with Brown to discuss how to fix the offense. Brown also denied those meetings occurred. </p>\n<p>\"I don't recall a meeting,\" Brown said after the loss to the Giants. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" </p><p>Brown did have one of his best games of the season against New York with six catches for 80 yards. </p><p>Barkley did not, however. The 2024 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> Offensive Player of the Year continued to struggle with just 12 carries for 58 yards. He logged 27 of those yards on his first two touches of the game. Barkley is averaging just 3.4 yards per carry after he led the league in rushing and yards from scrimmage as Philadelphia's bell cow back last season. </p>\n<p>\"Last year, do you think we were predictable?\" Barkley said Thursday night. \"Everyone knew we were running the ball. yet we still got it off. I think we also got to get back to that attitude, to have the mindset of not really giving a f--- what people trying to do.\" </p><p>Philadelphia currently ranks 29th in the NFL with 274.5 yards of offense per game. The Eagles are also one of just eight <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/teams/\">NFL teams</a> to average fewer than 100 yards rushing per game. </p><p> \"We've all got to be better. That's the truth,\" Barkley said. \"If anybody else thinks anything different, they've got to wake up soon in my opinion.\" </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

After another thrilling victory in Game 3, the Aces will have a chance to complete a sweep and win their third championship in the last four years.

Satou Sabally, who was averaging a team-high 21.7 points, six rebounds and three assists in the Finals, left Game 3 in the fourth quarter after a nasty collision and has been ruled out for Game 4 due to a concussion. </p><h2>2025 WNBA Finals schedule</h2><ul><li><strong>Game 1: </strong>Aces 89, Mercury 86 </li><li><strong>Game 2: </strong>Aces 91, Mercury 78 </li><li><strong>Game 3:</strong> Aces 90, Mercury 88 </li><li><strong>Game 4:</strong> Aces (-3) at Mercury, Friday, Oct. 10, 8 p.m. ET -- ESPN/<a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/stream/sports/?irad=368998&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></li><li><strong>Game 5*:</strong> Mercury at Aces, Sunday, Oct. 12, 3 p.m. ET -- ABC/<a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/stream/sports/?irad=368998&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a> </li><li><strong>Game 6*:</strong> Aces at Mercury, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 8 p.m. ET -- ESPN/<a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/stream/sports/?irad=368998&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></li><li><strong>Game 7*:</strong> Mercury at Aces, Friday, Oct. 17, 8 p.m. ET -- ESPN /<a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/stream/sports/?irad=368998&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></li></ul><p><em>*If necessary</em></p><p>The Aces entered the season with expectations of contending after their early playoff exit last season, but got off to a disappointing start. They were still below .500 in late July and lost by 53 points to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> on Aug. 2. That historic defeat spurred their incredible late-season turnaround, and they closed the regular season on a 16-game winning streak to earn the No. 2 seed. In the playoffs, though, the Aces have not looked so dominant. They needed all three games to defeat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Seattle Storm</a> in the first round, and all five games to get past the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Indiana Fever</a> in the semifinals. </p>\n<p>No one was sure what would happen with the Mercury this season after their complete overhaul in the winter. Franchise icons <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105071/diana-taurasi/\">Diana Taurasi</a> (retirement) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2063686/brittney-griner/\">Brittney Griner</a> (free agency) departed, and only two members of their 2024 squad returned. They brought in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677941/satou-sabally/\">Satou Sabally</a> to form a big three with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677851/kahleah-copper/\">Kahleah Copper</a>, but had a largely untested supporting cast. Their regular-season campaign was choppy at times, in part due to injuries, but they proved they could be a real threat thanks to their top-tier talent. Likewise, their playoff run has been a roller coaster, but they've taken out the reigning champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">New York Liberty</a> and top-seeded Minnesota Lynx. </p><p>This is the third Finals appearance in the last four seasons for the Aces, who are seeking their third championship in franchise history. The Mercury, meanwhile, are in the Finals for the first time since 2021, and trying to win a fourth title, which would move them into a tie with the Lynx, Seattle Storm and now-defunct Houston Comets for the most all-time. </p>\n<h2>Game 4 Prediction</h2><p>As we've seen throughout the playoffs, shorthanded teams are not always easy to put away. No one knows that better than the Aces, who nearly lost to the Fever in the semifinals. Still, it's impossible to actually pick the Mercury here. Offense has been a real issue for them throughout the playoffs, and now they're without one of their most dynamic players.  <strong>Pick: Aces -3</strong></p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n                        </div>",

Yet Kerkering was unable to field the ball cleanly, and had to retrieve it from in front of the mound. Though he appeared to have ample time to fire to first base for the out, he instead attempted to throw home -- \"attempted,\" because his throw sailed wide, allowing the run to score. </p><p>Here's a look at the play in question:</p>\n<p>Kerkering, understandably, appeared distraught in the moment and as he came off the mound. Afterward, he shared his perspective with the press.</p><p>\"I won't say the pressure got to me, I just thought it was a faster throw to [catcher J.T.

Just a horseshit throw,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/OnPattison/status/1976481955232501812\">Kerkering said</a>. He noted that he didn't hear anyone direct his throw to first base, verbally or otherwise. </p>\n<p>\"This really f----ing sucks right now,\" Kerkering said when he was asked if he could use this moment for good, \"but hopefully keep pushing, get over this hump.\"</p><p>A number of Phillies personnel weighed in on the play to offer their support to their pitcher.</p><p>\"Just keep his head up.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> is a funny league, especially when the unpredictable happens. There's a reason why we all tune in every single week, not knowing what's going to happen despite the oddsmakers telling you what to expect. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a> had no chance to beat the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, right? </p><p>Not only did New York beat Philadelphia, the Giants stomped the Eagles. The Giants were the more physical team for all four quarters in a 34-17 victory, destroying the defending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champions. The Eagles are far from that right now, as they have lost two games in five days after a 4-0 start.</p><p>The Giants just lost to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a> five days ago, sandwiched in between knocking off the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> and Eagles at home over this 11-day stretch. New York is clearly a different team with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a> at quarterback, as the Giants went from a laughing stock to a tough out.</p><p>There is plenty to take away from the Giants blowout of the Eagles, a party for overreactions. Which overreactions from this game are actually overreactions and which are reality?</p>\n<h2>Howie Roseman is responsible for this Eagles disaster</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>Roseman set the stage for this team by signing players to one-year deals in an effort to save future cash for his young players. The result was letting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179277/josh-sweat/\">Josh Sweat</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2816306/milton-williams/\">Milton Williams</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1852913/darius-slay/\">Darius Slay</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2261492/isaiah-rodgers/\">Isaiah Rodgers</a>, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2867297/mekhi-becton/\">Mekhi Becton</a> walk in free agency or trade -- and not adequately replacing the majority of these players. </p><p>The Eagles have just 1.5 sacks from their edge rushers this season, and all are by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061139/zadarius-smith/\">Za'Darius Smith</a> -- who was not on the team in Week 1! <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3125143/jalyx-hunt/\">Jalyx Hunt</a> has been a non-factor, same with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260670/josh-uche/\">Josh Uche</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2975739/azeez-ojulari/\">Azeez Ojulari</a> couldn't get on the field the first four games. </p><p>The CB2 situation is a disaster, as neither <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139614/adoree-jackson/\">Adoree' Jackson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163940/kelee-ringo/\">Kelee Ringo</a> have stepped up to replace Slay. The Eagles traded for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163191/jakorian-bennett/\">Jakorian Bennett</a>, but he's injured at the moment. Meanwhile, Rodgers is one of the best defensive players in the league with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>. At right guard, Steen has been fine -- but not as dominant as Becton was last year. </p>\n<p>This team is still very talented, but there are glaring weaknesses that affect the Eagles week-to-week. That is on Roseman, as this Eagles team isn't as dominant as last year (which was expected). Roseman got what he paid for with the one-year signings, as the replacements -- and draft picks the Eagles are relying on -- just aren't very good. </p><p>The Eagles need reinforcements at pass rusher and CB2. They may be very busy this month. </p><h2>Jaxson Dart will save Brian Daboll's job</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Reality</p><p>If Daboll is on the hot seat, Dart is getting him off. Dart has been excellent in his three games as the Giants starting quarterback, completing 65.9% of his passes for 508 yards with four touchdowns to two interceptions (87.8 rating) while rushing for 167 yards and two touchdowns -- and the Giants are 2-1 in those three games. Yes, the Giants.</p>\n<p>Dart was great against the Eagles, making all the winning plays needed. He was 17 of 25 for 195 yards with a touchdown (104.6 rating), while rushing for 58 yards and a score. Dart was 7 of 9 for 99 yards on third and fourth downs with a 112.5 passer rating and was 4 of 8 for 117 yards with a touchdown on throws of 10+ air yards (135.4 rating). </p><p>Dart is proving to be a winning player, bringing life into a dormant Giants franchise. He's also saving Daboll's job in the process. </p><h2>Kevin Patullo won't last the season as Eagles OC</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>The Eagles still have time to get things right under Patullo, but the inconsistency of this offense is maddening. These numbers every single week describe how poor the offense can perform through large stretches of the game. </p>\n<p>This happens far too frequently in Philadelphia, a product of not being able to run the ball at all this season and trying to pass the ball too much to get the run game going. The offensive line isn't as dominant as in years past, and the running lanes have been taken away from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> as a plus-one. </p><p>The play calling isn't too creative either once the flow of the game is established, something Patullo is still learning six games into his tenure as the offensive coordinator. Can Patullo figure it out? He'll get the whole year to try, but Patullo will be under the microscope these next few weeks. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/\">Cam Skattebo</a> and Jaxson Dart have changed tide in Eagles-Giants rivalry</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>Dart and Skattebo certainly put the Eagles on notice with their performances on Thursday. The Giants set to prove they can match the Eagles' physicality, led by Skattebo and his bruising running style. Skattebo rushed for 98 yards and three touchdowns, wearing down the Eagles defense with his punishing runs and his willingness to get the extra yard. </p>\n<p>Dart even got in on the punishing runs, lowering his shoulder on a few runs and making sure he got extra yards after contact. The result was a Giants win over the Eagles, but has the rivalry changed? </p><p>Let's pump the brakes on that one. Dart and Skattebo have the Giants trending upward and giving New York something to believe in, but they also caught the Eagles in an identity crisis on offense while the defense was missing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163950/jalen-carter/\">Jalen Carter</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3163404/quinyon-mitchell/\">Quinyon Mitchell</a>. This can be revisited when the Eagles play the Giants in Week 8.</p><p>One thing that needs to be said: The Giants aren't pushovers nor are they the laughing stock of the league anymore.</p>\n<h2>Eagles will have a collapse similar to 2023</h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>Two losses in a row for the first time since 2023 doesn't mean the Eagles are collapsing. The Eagles have been outgained in every game this season -- and none of those teams that have been outgained in each of their first six games of the year have won a playoff game. But this team is too talented to just fall off the rails.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2253017/landon-dickerson/\">Landon Dickerson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2965152/cam-jurgens/\">Cam Jurgens</a> will get healthy. Same with Jalen Carter and Quinyon Mitchell. The Eagles are going to likely add a pass rusher or a cornerback by the trade deadline, having a bunch of draft picks in 2026 to get a starting-caliber player. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> and the offensive line also have to get going at some point. </p><p>However ... if the collapse does happen, it'll be due to mediocre offensive line play and a pass rush that's nonexistent at edge rusher. Let's not get to that stage yet with the Eagles after a two-game losing streak, especially that we're only in Week 6. </p>\n<h2>This was the worst day in Philadelphia sports history </h2><p><strong>Overreaction or reality:</strong> Overreaction</p><p>The Phillies lost in 11 innings to get eliminated by the Dodgers in the NLDS -- in the worst possible way to end a season. The Eagles got beaten up by a Giants team that lost to the Saints four days ago, and the Flayers lost their season opener to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Panthers</a>. </p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/philadelphia-has-one-of-its-worst-sports-days-as-phillies-eagles-flyers-all-lose/\" target=\"_blank\">This wasn't a great day to be a Philadelphia sports fan</a></span>. The Phillies' season is over and the Eagles actually are losing games. This was an emotional day for Philadelphia sports, especially since it looks like the Phillies run with their current core group of players could be over. The Eagles look like an uninspired team that can't figure things out either.</p><p>Believe it or not, Philadelphia has had worse sports days. This is a city that once had their stadium closed down by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Buccaneers</a> in the NFC Championship Game and a baseball team that had a 6.5-game lead with 12 to play in 1964 -- and lost the pennant. Ben Simmons also passed up a dunk once to give the Sixers the lead late in a Game 7 at home. </p>\n<p>Things will be okay Philadelphia. There have been worse sports days. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "\nThe last chance to make a Week 16 NFL SGP comes on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers visit the Indianapolis Colts (4.5, 46.5) at 8:15 p.m. ET. Both teams are on streaks, as San Fran has won four straight, while Indy has lost four straight. That would make NFL picks on the money line in favor of the Niners attractive for a 'Monday Night Football' SGP, but the recent history of this matchup may suggest otherwise. The Colts have won five straight games versus the Niners, so your MNF same-game parlay may want to consider NFL props, spread picks and the over/under.While this game features the likes of Christian McCaffrey, Jonathan Taylor and George Kittle, many will target 44-year-old Philip Rivers with prop bets for their MNF SGP. After 120 passing yards last week, Rivers' O/U for passing yards is 158.5 for Monday. San Fran's defense isn't the same caliber as the one in Seattle that Rivers saw last Sunday, so the Over could be appealing for your NFL same-game parlay. Before locking in any Colts vs. 49ers picks for your 'Monday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the 49ers vs. Colts prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins to bet on props like Jonathan Taylor as an anytime touchdown scorer:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Colts vs. 49ers on 'Monday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of well over 6-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for San Francisco vs. Indianapolis here.Top Monday Night Football SGP picksAfter simulating 49ers vs. Colts, SportsLine AI says Niners running back Christian McCaffrey goes Under 17.5 carries (+102). With the postseason in their sights, the Niners are giving backup, Brian Robinson Jr., more touches in order to keep McCaffrey fresh for the playoffs. The former Commander has at least seven carries in each of his last five games, after reaching that number just twice over his first nine contests. Additionally, Indy's defensive strengths and weaknesses may have San Francisco lean on McCaffrey more thru the air than on the ground.The Colts have the No. 6 run defense and have allowed the second-fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025. On the other hand, the Colts have the second-worst pass defense, and San Fran will need more out of McCaffrey through the air with Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) out. McCaffrey is projected to have 14.4 carries on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here.Bet McCaffrey to go Under 17.5 carries at DraftKings:\nHow to make Colts vs. 49ers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has six other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your 49ers vs. Colts SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Colts vs. 49ers predictions?

San Fran also has a huge primetime advantage when it comes to the spread, as it has covered in all three such games this year, while Indy is 0-5 ATS over its last five under the bright lights of primetime.

Philip Rivers' return to the NFL at age 44 has become one of the most-discussed sports topics of 2025, and on Monday, he'll take the field in front of a national audience when the Indianapolis Colts host the San Francisco 49ers. SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Rivers and Colts to keep the game competitive, playing the Colts as 5.5-point underdogs as a part of its Monday NFL best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Colts vs. 49ers is 46 points, down a half-point from the opening line.The model also has one of its Monday best bets coming from NBA action, backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 15.5-point favorites against the Memphis Grizzlies.

The Colts kept the Seahawks out of the end zone for the entire game, resulting in six Seattle field goals and culminating with Jason Myers needing to convert a 56-yard kick with 18 seconds left for the win. Rivers completed 66.7 percent of his passes (18 of 27) for 120 yards, but commanded the offense enough to have the Colts in the game late. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 87 yards, and the model expects Rivers and the offense to make enough plays to keep this contest close as well. The model projects the Colts to cover in 53% of simulations. Back the Colts at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Thunder (-15.5) vs. Grizzlies (-115)The Thunder have dropped two of their last three games, but that shouldn't create a cause for concern for Monday or the remainder of the season. Oklahoma City still has a chance at a historic season after winning 24 of its first 25 games and opening the season at 25-3 after winning last year's NBA championship. The Grizzlies are without Ja Morant (ankle), and they are coming off a 130-122 home loss on Saturday to the Wizards, which resulted in just Washington's fifth win of the season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is having another MVP-caliber season at 32.5 points per game, which ranks second in the league, for OKC. Back the Thunder at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Magic (+5.5) vs. Warriors (-105)\"Some injuries to note both ways here (Franz Wagner out and Jalen Suggs doubtful for Orlando; Steph Curry out for Golden State), but the Magic won't be lacking for confidence after beating the Warriors with Curry by a 121-113 count on November 18 when Desmond Bane scored 23,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"Note that Orlando was also minus Paolo Banchero for the first meeting, and he has since returned, after Jamahl Mosley's Magic kept things close vs. the Dubs in both meetings during an injury-filled 2024-25 campaign. Steve Kerr has even admitted frustration lately with his Warriors, who had lost three straight before nipping the Suns by 2 in Phoenix on Saturday after losing three of the previous four at Chase Center.

    "body": "\n        'Tis the season to be jolly, or so they say. With Christmas upon us, we enter what is basically a six-day week. However, surprisingly, the schedule is relatively 'normal', with only one team playing twice, that being the Brooklyn Nets. We have 18 teams suiting up three times, while the remaining 11 teams will take to the court on three occasions each. Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: CLE, DAL, DEN, DET, IND, MEM, NOP, OKC, ORL, POR, UTAThree Games: ATL, BOS, CHA, CHI, GSW, HOU, LAC, LAL, MIA, MIL, MIN, NYK, PHI, PHO, SAC, SAS, TOR, WASTwo Games: BKNHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the tenth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Cam Spencer, MEMOpponents: @OKC, @UTA, MIL, @WASWith injuries continuing to plague the Grizzlies, Spencer has emerged as a must-roster player, even in standard leagues. While the eventual return of both Ty Jerome and Scottie Pippen will complicate things, Spencer simply needs to be prioritized, at least for the foreseeable future. Many might argue that Spencer has been a better option than Ja Morant this season, which has some statistical evidence. In 11 games over the past month, Spencer has averaged 17.1 points, 5.7 assists, 0.9 steals, and 3.5 three-pointers, shooting 59.6 percent from the floor and 100 percent from the line. With four games tabled for week 10, as well as continued injury risk attached to Morant, Spencer is a no-brainer when it comes to selecting your starting lineup.Consider starting: Ryan Nembhard, DALOpponents: @NOP, DEN, @GSW, @SACThe sit-start decision is a little trickier when it comes to Nembhard, despite the fact that he seems locked in as the starting point guard. Head coach Jason Kidd is no stranger when it comes to weird rotations, and that certainly goes for Nembhard. While he has started in 10 straight games, his playing time has fluctuated on a nightly basis, ranging from 21 to 38 minutes. With that said, his assist numbers have been relatively consistent, while those behind him in the rotation have done very little to further their case for more playing time. There could certainly be a dud on the horizon. However, with four games in the next seven days, there should be enough meat on the bone for managers to shift Nembhard in their starting lineups.Consider sitting: Ryan Rollins, MILOpponents: @IND, @MEM, @CHISpeaking of coaches who are known for curious decision-making, Doc Rivers absolutely falls into that category. While the return of Kevin Porter was always going to impact Ryan Rollins, managers may have underestimated the impact Rivers' mindset would have. Rollins has now come off the bench in two consecutive games and has played fewer than 30 minutes in five straight contests. His production has remained viable despite the reduced role, so he is definitely not someone managers will want to drop. However, with limited opportunities, there is a chance that limited production could follow. Rollins played just six minutes in the first half during Sunday's loss to the Timberwolves, a worrying sign despite his 16 minutes in the second half. Moving him to the bench might be a safe option, at least until some sort of sanity returns to Milwaukee.\nForwardsConsider starting: Naji Marshall, DALOpponents: @NOP, DEN, @GSW, @SACA depleted frontcourt has resulted in Marshall playing a lot of minutes and subsequently putting up solid production. In 13 games over the past month, Marshall has been a borderline top 70 player in standard leagues, averaging 14.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 three-pointers in 30.4 minutes per game. He has started in nine straight games, despite the return of Anthony Davis, and given the team's recent success, he could remain a starter for the foreseeable future. Another player with four games coming up, Marshall is worth slotting into your starting lineup, with the understanding that his overall upside is somewhat limited.Consider sitting: Jordan Walsh, BOSOpponents: IND, @IND, @PORIs the fairytale over for Walsh? While we probably don't need to go that far, his recent slump has provided managers with a sense of reality. He has scored single digits in four of the past five games, the most recent of which he failed to score a single point. During that stretch, he has averaged 8.6 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.0 three-pointers, and 2.2 combined steals and blocks, well below what fantasy managers have come to expect. Although his spot in the starting lineup feels relatively secure, it is clear that his playing time is not. A low-volume player with only three games is definitely worth moving to the bench, in the hope that he can regain some momentum heading into the following week.Consider sitting: Noah Clowney, BKNOpponents: @PHI, @MINSomehow, Brooklyn has won five of its past eight games, with Clowney continuing to play a sizeable role. Unlike previous seasons, Clowney has been given the freedom to make mistakes without the fear of being subbed out of the game. This has resulted in his best season to date, averaging 17.3 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, and 2.8 three-pointers in 13 appearances over the past month. However, the dreaded two-game week may be just enough to sink him, at least for the next seven days. Unless you are in desperate need of points and threes, you are likely going to have other options available to you in terms of games played.\nCentersConsider starting: Isaiah Stewart, DETOpponents: @POR, @SAC, @UTA, @LACStewart's offensive production has been relatively underwhelming of late, averaging just 9.5 points per game in 13 appearances over the past month. However, during that time, he has also averaged 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks, keeping him firmly on the standard league radar. With four games coming up, anyone who could possibly give you 30 rebounds and 10 blocks is worth considering as a starting option. A perfect example of where Stewart could have value is if you also have Nic Claxton. Simple math would tell you that four games of Stewart likely beats out two games of Claxton.Consider sitting: Nic Claxton, BKNOpponents: @PHI, @MINAs for Claxton, he is another player who is putting together a relatively strong season, much like his teammate from earlier in the piece. Known for his ability to deliver typical big man stats, Claxton has quietly added another element to his game, tallying double-digit assists on two separate occasions thus far. Despite his encouraging play, two games are simply not enough, especially considering that Brooklyn is the only team with two games. In most situations, giving him the week off makes a lot of sense.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While the brief return of Philip Rivers is clearly about more than a paycheck, he is nonetheless being financially compensated during his NFL comeback with the Indianapolis Colts. Rivers, who made $244 million during his first 17 seasons in the NFL, is making a prorated veteran minimum of $278,889 for the final weeks of the 2025 season. Rivers' return also restarted his five-year NFL heath insurance coverage. Not a bad deal for a 44-year-old father of 10 and grandfather of one who had not played a down of professional football in nearly five years. Rivers has a chance to further cash in on his comeback if he can lead the Colts to the playoffs. Players on wildcard teams receive $49,500, while players on division championship teams will earn an additional $54,500, which is the same amount players receive if their teams advance to the divisional round of the playoffs. Players whose teams reach the conference championship receive an additional $77,000. The Super Bowl runner-up earns $96,000, and players on the team that wins Super Bowl LX will rake in $171,000. \nAs noted above, Rivers' return to the gridiron is not financially motivated. A high school football coach since his initial retirement from the NFL, Rivers hopes that his comeback can serve as inspiration. \"There is doubt, and it's real,\" Rivers said following the Colts' Week 15 loss to Seattle. \"The guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is, 'Shoot, let's see what happens.' I hope in that sense that can be a positive to some young boys, or young people.\"Given the circumstances, Rivers' season debut was largely a success. He went 18 of 27 for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception as the Colts nearly upset the Seahawks in Seattle. Rivers also came away from the game largely unscathed. \nRivers hopes to push the ball downfield more on on Monday night against a San Francisco 49ers team that -- like the Colts -- is fighting for playoff spot. \"I don't feel any really limitations pushing the ball down the field,\" he said. \"Am I gonna throw it 60 yards? No, but I can't name many times I ever did that anyway. But if you get it out on time in the things that we can do, I don't think that there's like, 'Oh, we can't call this, or we can't call that.' It'll be a solid plan that the staff puts together and and we'll have a great week of practice and go out and execute.\"LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Colts battle the 49ers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is likely to hit a lull over the coming days, as front office personnel around the league observe the holiday season. But there's still enough time left for teams to cross some last-minute items off their list. Sunday alone saw the White Sox ink Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami and the Red Sox acquire first baseman Willson Contreras in a four-player trade. What will Monday bring? Below, CBS Sports has compiled all the day's news and moves in one place.   \tReds, White Sox talking Robert The Reds and White Sox are again discussing a trade that would send center fielder Luis Robert Jr. to Cincinnati, reports the Cincinnati Enquirer. Chicago is said to be willing to eat money, perhaps as much as half the $20 million Robert is owed in 2026, to facilitate a trade. The Reds are deep in young pitching, something the White Sox are said to want in return. \nRobert, 28, has had back-to-back disappointing years at the plate, though he remains a strong defender and top-flight baserunner. He's two years removed from hitting 38 home runs, and center fielders who can do that are rare. The Reds and White Sox have previously discussed a Robert trade on several occasions, including last offseason and again at the July trade deadline. We ranked Robert as the No. 22 trade candidate entering the offseason.   \tMariners bring in Refsnyder  Platoon corner outfielder Rob Refsnyder is joining the Mariners on a one-year contract, the team announced. The deal is worth $6.25 million, per The Athletic. Refsnyder, 34, has spent the last four years as a lefty masher with the Red Sox, posting a .923 OPS against southpaws from 2022-25. That figured dropped to a .670 OPS against righties.  \nThe Mariners have three right-handed hitting outfielders (Randy Arozarena, Victor Robles, Julio Rodríguez), though Dominic Canzone is expected to get most of the DH at-bats, and he's a left-handed hitter. Barring additional moves, Refsnyder is in line to platoon with Canzone and get at-bats spread around DH and the two corner outfield spots.   We ranked Refsnyder as the 43rd-best free agent available this offseason.  \n  Red Sox still want Bregman back  The Red Sox intend to add more offense to their roster even after the aforementioned Contreras acquisition -- and retaining third baseman Alex Bregman continues to be a priority, per The Athletic.   \nBregman, 31, posted a 128 OPS+ and 3.5 Wins Above Replacement last season in 114 games with the Red Sox. He then opted out of what was technically a three-year pact but spiritually a series of one-year arrangements. Bregman would slot back in at third base, with the Red Sox sorting through their collection of young infielders to determine their second baseman.   Bregman is also of interest to the Diamondbacks, Blue Jays, Cubs, and Tigers.    \tPirates chasing more bats after Lowe trade  The Red Sox aren't alone in trying to double-dip on bats. The Pirates added second baseman Brandon Lowe on Friday, and yet that hasn't stopped them from chasing after more bats. Instead, they have had several virtual meetings with Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto, per the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  CBS Sports ranked Okamoto as the 22nd-best free agent available this winter. Here's what we wrote:  \nOkamoto isn't as famous or as exciting as his countryman Munetaka Murakami, but he has a better hit tool and he should find a MLB home after hitting .327/.416/.598 with 15 home runs and as many walks as strikeouts in 69 games. There are always concerns about how NPB batters will fare against MLB-caliber velocity. Okamoto is no exception in that regard. Add in the possibility that he's viewed as just a first baseman (a right-handed-hitting one at that) and he could have a limited market. Still, it's worth acknowledging that some models, like this component-based one created by former Marlins front office analyst Bradley Woodrum, have Okamoto as the best bet among NPB bats to hit in MLB. \t \tOkamoto's posting window is set to close on Jan. 4.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Bad luck would be better than the injury luck the Kansas City Chiefs have experienced this season. That trend continued during their Week 16 loss to the Tennessee Titans as quarterback Gardner Minshew -- who started the game in placed of injured starter Patrick Mahomes -- sustained a knee injury that led to him missing the majority of the game. While it was initially feared that he had suffered a torn ACL, Minshew's ACL is reportedly still intact. However, Minshew is still expected to miss the rest of the season, which led to the Chiefs signing fellow quarterback Shane Buechele off the Buffalo Bills' practice squad for the season's final two weeks. A former undrafted rookie, Buechele won a Super Bowl in 2023 while serving as Mahomes' backup. Minshew was replaced on Sunday by backup Chris Oladokun, who went 11 of 16 for 111 yards and was sacked four times after Minshew went to the locker room. The Titans took a 9-6 lead into intermission before pulling away for a 26-9 win. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Oladokun, 28, in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Oladokun signed three years ago after he hit waivers. His only previous regular season experience took place in Week 18 of the 2024 season. He had never thrown a pass in a regular season game prior to Sunday. \nMinshew, 29, is in his first season with the Chiefs, his fourth team over the past five seasons. He earned a Pro Bowl nod in 2023 after throwing for a career-high 3,305 yards in 13 starts with the Indianapolis Colts. \nMahomes sustained a season-ending knee injuring during the loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14 that knocked Kansas City out of postseason contention. This season marks the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs. \nThe Chiefs fell to 6-9 with Sunday's loss and will round out the season with a home game against the Denver Broncos on Christmas and a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of Nick Saban's forgotten coaching disciples prior to his magical two-year run at Indiana, Curt Cignetti credits the Alabama legend with helping him set up his own process behind the scenes as the leader of a program while instituting principles that have led to sizable wins.As the anchor of the top-seeded and unbeaten Hoosiers entering next week's College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup with the Crimson Tide at the Rose Bowl, Cignetti has not forgotten his early roots in the coaching ranks.\"[He's a] real important part of my journey,\" Cignetti said Monday. \"[I] learned a lot from Coach Saban in terms of organization and standards. I wouldn't be where I am today without my time under Nick. My family really enjoyed Tuscaloosa.\"Cut from the same no BS cloth as Saban, Cignetti reportedly flourished in a \"sink-or-swim environment\" as an assistant coach and recruiting advisor at Alabama in 2007 and it was there he saw what turned out to be the makings of an eventual college football dynasty.\nIn fact, it was Cignetti who was the lead recruiter for future Alabama Heisman winner Mark Ingram, the running back who helped the Crimson Tide to the first of six national titles under Saban in 2009.\"He was knowledgeable about recruiting and knew everybody on the board because he was sending us out,\" former Alabama running backs coach Burton Burns told CBS Sports' John Talty last year. \"He was built for the job, it was in his DNA. He knew how to do all those things. He was really good on the road. I went on the road a few times with him, and he was really good with coaches and the family of those kids.\"Alabama was Cignetti's third coaching stop in the Power conference ranks and he spent five years on Saban's offensive staff before becoming a head coach for the first time at IUP in 2011. After turning that program around and finding success at Elon and James Madison, Indiana took a chance of Cignetti ahead of the 2024 campaign and he's done the rest.\nCignetti's won 24 of his first 26 games with the Hoosiers entering the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl and pushed Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945 this season. Cignetti has another Heisman winner to boot in quarterback Fernando Mendoza, whom he plucked out of the transfer portal from California last cycle and has watched the 6-foot-5 junior throw for 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns this fall.The transfer portal has been Cignetti's primary strength at Indiana, according to Saban.\"I think when you're having that many changes on your roster every year, you have to do a fantastic job of evaluation, which Curt Cignetti has done that so far,\" Saban said earlier this season on College GameDay. \"I don't think you could change a program as quickly as he has Indiana, especially one that doesn't have a tradition of success and culture as a football program without transfer portal.\n\"We need new players, quick players. We need to be able to do this quickly. And he brought a bunch of players from his old school that knew his culture and how he wanted to do it. And got a quarterback in there that could make some plays. Now he has an even better quarterback, in my opinion.\"On the heels of consecutive top-30 portal signing classes where player evaluation was paramount, Cignetti says his sales pitch at Indiana is unique -- and awfully blunt.\"I used to tell them everybody can't play for the Yankees, man,\" Cignetti said earlier this season. \"I mean, that's the way it is. So don't come here if this is not what you want to do, because the standard is high. The commitment has got to be high.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A surprisingly poor season has the Baltimore Ravens on the verge of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2021, and with those postseason hopes dwindling after the Week 16 loss to the New England Patriots, team leadership fell further under the microscope. John Harbaugh has been a model of consistency throughout his 18-year tenure in Baltimore but suddenly faces real questions about his job security.When asked whether he is concerned about his grip on the job, though, Harbaugh brushed off the threat of a firing.\"Coaching at any level is a day-to-day job,\" Harbaugh said on the heels of his eighth loss this season. \"Your job is to do the best job you can today and to do everything you can to help your players -- and your coaches if you're a head coach -- be the best they can be every single day. It's never been about keeping a job. There's no such thing as 'your' job or 'my' job. We have responsibilities. We're given opportunities to steward those responsibilities, and you're given a job to do that until you're not.\"The Ravens' only road to the postseason is to win the AFC North, but to do so would require them to win out and the Pittsburgh Steelers to lose out. Anything short of those results would force Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and the rest of the star-laden roster to watch the playoffs from home. That is a precarious situation that few would have expected the preseason Super Bowl contenders to find themselves in for the final two weeks of the campaign.\nA losing record also remains on the table for the 7-8 Ravens, who have finished under .500 just twice in Harbaugh's prolific run.\"I try to do the job, not try to keep the job,\" said the 63-year-old Harbaugh. \"There's no such thing as 'having' a job. It's just 'doing' a job. So my focus is on, and it has been for the last 18 years here and last 41 years in coaching, to try to do the best job I can today and fight as hard as I can so the guys have the best chance to be successful today.\"Anything after today, I'm not thinking about because it's not given for us to think about. We don't have control over that except for the job we do today. If we do a good enough job today, then the opportunity to do that job or do a different job will be there tomorrow. That's what you hope for.\"\nHarbaugh regularly has Baltimore in the mix with the best teams in the league but has not broken through for a Super Bowl victory in 13 years. To boast a two-time MVP in Lamar Jackson and a typically elite defense but to be in the midst of a championship drought only emphasizes the sting of this particularly underwhelming season.Who would replace John Harbaugh?Harbaugh set a high bar over 18 years as the winningest coach in Ravens history and the third-winningest coach in the NFL since his arrival. Finding a successor who can uphold that standard is no guarantee. But the Ravens would be an attractive destination for potential candidates if they were to make a move.Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady has long been regarded as a premier assistant coach, at both the college and NFL levels, and will likely hear his name swirl as a target for head coaching opportunities this offseason. He has experience with an MVP-caliber quarterback in Josh Allen and could make excellent use of Jackson and his supporting cast.\nIf the Ravens were inclined to stay within the Harbaugh tree, they could look toward Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. The former Baltimore defensive backs coach has experience working under both John Harbaugh and Jim Harbaugh, won a national championship at Michigan and built back-to-back top-10 defenses upon his return to the NFL.Former head coaches including Robert Saleh and Brian Flores could also emerge as priority candidates. Other star coordinators such as Klink Kubiak and Chris Shula could be in line for opportunities, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State and Miami have a history when it comes to postseason play. The No. 1 Buckeyes and No. 10 Hurricanes are set for battle in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals and will renew a rivalry that developed in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl when Ohio State reigned supreme, controversially, for the BCS national championship.The painful memory of the double-overtime loss still haunts Hurricanes fans more than two decades after the fact. Ohio State star Jeremiah Smith has seen the discourse from the Miami faithful surrounding that infamous showdown, and it appears to be a point of motivation for the elite wide receiver.\"You see it all over the internet, all over Twitter,\" Smith said. \"They're still talking about that 20 years later. They still worry about it. But we've got something coming for them New Year's Eve.\"Smith, a Miami Gardens, Florida, native, figures to be about as in-tune with Miami football discourse as anyone on the Ohio State roster given his deep ties to the region.\nMiami entered the 2023 national championship game as a commanding favorite in search of its second title in as many years. It entered the contest on a 34-game winning streak and boasted countless future NFL stars on a roster that produced a third straight Big East championship.Ohio State built a 10-point lead in the Fiesta Bowl and carried an advantage into the fourth quarter. The Hurricanes clawed back, though, and kicker Todd Sievers drilled a 40-yard field goal as time expired in regulation to knot the score at 17 and force overtime. It was just the second time in BCS, Bowl Alliance or Bowl Coalition history that a game required an additional period.Controversy struck an already tense championship game in the first overtime session. Down a touchdown, Ohio State needed to find the end zone to keep the game alive. It had already converted on fourth down once in the period, and on a fourth-and-3, a Craig Krenzel pass fell incomplete to seemingly end the game and crown Miami as the national champion. Amid the Hurricanes' celebration, however, an official threw a flag for pass interference that awarded the Buckeyes a first down and another chance to tie the game.\nOhio State scored, forced double overtime and won with a goal-line stand to stun the Hurricanes in a game that effectively altered both program's trajectories.Miami has yet to come as close to a national title as it was in that 2002 season, while Ohio State added two more to its ledger over the ensuing decades.The bitter taste of agonizing defeat from that championship game still lingers in the Hurricanes' mouths. They will seek vengeance on Dec. 31 in the Cotton Bowl, this time as a hefty underdog. And while the stakes are lower with this matchup coming in the CFP quarterfinal, Miami would have to feel optimistic about its title chances if it defeats the No. 2 seed Buckeyes. Only two more games would stand between Mario Cristobal's team and the trophy.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Indianapolis Colts' Philip Rivers Reunion Tour rolls through Lucas Oil Stadium on Monday when the slumping Colts host the surging San Francisco 49ers in a Monday Night Football matchup.The first leg of the tour was not exactly a hit for the Colts. Last week against the Seahawks, the 44-year-old Rivers completed 18 of 27 passes, including a touchdown, but Old Man Rivers, who even in his prime did not have a cannon for an arm, struggled getting the ball downfield and threw a game-ending interception when Indianapolis was running out of time. The Colts lost, 18-16, which was their fourth straight defeat. Indianapolis (8-6) desperately needs a win on Monday to keep its dwindling playoff hopes alive.On Monday Rivers and the Colts will face a San Francisco team heading in the opposite direction. The 49ers (10-4) have won four in a row and already have clinched a spot in the postseason. Quarterback Brock Purdy is coming off an efficient performance, completing 23 of 30 passes for 295 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions against the Titans. San Francisco is a 5.5-point favorite over Indianapolis on Monday night.While Colts vs. 49ers is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes a seven-game NBA slate and a full NCAA basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Dec. 22.

White)\nIndianapolis' narrow defeat last week in Seattle needs a bit of context. The Seahawks gained 314 total yards against the Colts defense but had to settle for six field goals as quarterback Sam Darnold misfired. In addition, how badly did Rivers struggle throwing the ball downfield against Seattle? According to Next Gen Stats, he went 2-for-8 for 33 yards, a 4.7 passer rating and the game-ending interception on throws of 10-plus air yards. \"[San Francisco defensive coordinator] Robert Saleh should have a field day scheming against such a limited QB, and I could see Indy held to single digits as a result,\" White says. \"A surging 49ers team likely deserves to be -7.\" However the SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, says Indianapolis has a 41.0% chance to win and assigns a B grade to Colts money line (+205).More NFL best betsBest sportsbook promos for 49ers-ColtsModel's anytime touchdown scorer props for Monday nightModel's Brock Purdy, Philip Rivers player propsModel's George Kittle, Tyler Warren player propsSportsLine AI's same-game parlay picksWill Brinson's top Monday Night Football playsNBA best bets, where to watchHornets at CavaliersTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Cleveland | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cavaliers -9.5 | Expert: Hornets +9.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nWhat's wrong with the Cavs? One season after winning an Eastern Conference-best 64 games, Cleveland is 15-14, has lost three in a row, eight of its last 11, and sits in seventh place in the East. One of those losses came to these same Hornets at Rocket Arena. Donovan Mitchell went 6-of-24 that day while rookie Kon Knueppel scored 29 for Charlotte. \"The Hornets also had a win on the road at Toronto within the past two-plus weeks and have usually been staying within earshot as Knueppel, who's led the team in scoring for four straight games, has emerged as a force,\" Marshall says. The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says that the Cavaliers have a 59.0% chance to cover and gives a C grade to Cleveland -9.5.Grizzlies at ThunderTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Thunder -15.5\nStop the presses. After winning 24 of their first 25 games, the reigning NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder have lost two of their last three. The offense has sputtered over that stretch, producing 106.6 points per 100 possessions, which is a significant dropoff from their season average of 119.0. But they still own an elite defense, which is limiting opponents to 103.2 points per 100 possessions. That's bad news for a Grizzlies team that ranks 24th in the league in offensive rating (112.5) and is coming off a loss to the Wizards (5-22), who own the worst record in the NBA. The SportsLine Projection Model says Oklahoma City has a 67.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Thunder -15.5.Looking aheadBoca Raton Bowl: Toledo vs. LouisvilleTime: 2 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Boca Raton, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 43.5 | Expert: Over 43.5 (Mike Tierney)\nThe Boca Raton Bowl features two high-scoring offenses.

Tierney also notes that Louisville's two bowl games under coach Jeff Brohm were scoring-fests: 70 and 69 points. \"Under a south Florida sun with weather conducive for scoring, this number could be caught by third quarter's end,\" Tierney says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It says there's a 62.0% chance the teams combine for 44 points or more and gives a B grade to Over 43.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers wideout DK Metcalf is awaiting potential discipline from the NFL after he had an altercation with a fan in the first half of Pittsburgh's 29-24 victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday.Metcalf was captured by CBS cameras walking over to a Detroit fan in the first row, grabbing his shirt and then appearing to throw a punch. According to NFL Media, Metcalf actually has a history with this fan, and reported the same fan to security last year when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks and they were playing the Lions in Detroit.\nThe Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan, who identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan. The fan said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, leading to the altercation.\"He doesn't like his government name,\" Kennedy told the Free Press. \"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I'm a little shocked. Like everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"Metcalf has a different version of events claiming multiple derogatory words were used, per NFL Media. Kennedy denied using any slurs in a statement released Monday through an attorney.\nMetcalf was not penalized for his interaction, as the incident took place off the field. The fan was not ejected from the game, per the Free Press. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin did not pull Metcalf from the game either, and he finished with 42 yards receiving on four catches.\"I heard about it, but I hadn't seen it and I hadn't had an opportunity to talk to DK and so I have no comment,\" Tomlin said after the game.CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore explained during the game that it wasn't expected the officials would flag Metcalf for this altercation, but that the league would definitely look into it. \n\"Because the officials did not see this -- and you wouldn't expect them to from where DK Metcalf was, it's not something they can weigh in to from an officiating standpoint. I have been notified, though, that will be delivered to compliance with the NFL, and they'll address it at that point,\" Steratore said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens' playoff hopes took quite a shot on Sunday night, as they fell to 7-8 with a 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. In addition to the Patriots clinching a playoff spot, a main headline from this matchup was Ravens star quarterback Lamar Jackson exiting in the second quarter with a back injury and not returning. On Monday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson has a back contusion -- or a bruise. \"Painful, certainly,\" Harbaugh said. \"Saw him in here getting treatment this morning and this afternoon, early. He's been classified as day-to-day on that, nothing beyond the contusion but I don't want to minimize the severity and pain level of that, because it's legit.\" Jackson struggled to walk out of the locker room after speaking with reporters, according to the Ravens' official website. The two-time MVP was injured on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from Patriots safety Craig Woodson. After the game, Jackson admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game. \"It's BS, bro,\" Jackson said. \"I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.\"\nJackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Tyler Huntley replaced Jackson under center, and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.\"My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,\" Jackson said. \"Pain. It hurts. [It] hurts.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: Three teams punch tickets after Colts' loss; Panthers seize NFC South lead\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMore tests will be completed, but Jackson hopes to start against the Green Bay Packers next Saturday in what is a must-win game for Baltimore. Even if Jackson starts, the Ravens haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know in recent years. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later. Previously, Jackson was 16-0.\nAccording to SportsLine, the Ravens have a 5.8% chance to win the AFC North, while the 9-6 Pittsburgh Steelers have a 94.2% chance to hold onto their division lead. \n            ",

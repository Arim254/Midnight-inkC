Mike McDaniel feels like a dead man walking, and Tua Tagovailoa may not be long as Miami's QB1 either. They are coming off a demoralizing 31-6 loss to the Browns, where Tagovailoa recorded his second game in a row with three interceptions. Those struggles likely won't subside against a Falcons defense that is allowing the fewest passing yards per game (141.2) and second-fewest total yards per game (265.2) this season.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Tyler Sullivan on why he likes Atlanta to not only beat Miami but cover the touchdown spread in the process.\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Pete Prisco\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cody Benjamin\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Jared Dubin\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Ryan Wilson\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    John Breech\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tyler Sullivan\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Dave Richard\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Jamey Eisenberg\n                            \n            Dolphins at Falcons (-7.5)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Falcons\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Dolphins\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Falcons\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Falcons\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Falcons\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Falcons\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Falcons\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Falcons\n                    \n    \n         Jets at BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+\n\"[Survivor-pool options] this week include the Chiefs as double-digit favorites for a second straight week and then six teams who are favorites of around a touchdown.

Surprisingly, it doesn't envision Drake Maye's top-level passing leading to a blowout win at home. One of the model's strongest Week 8 picks is that the Browns (+7, 40.5) cover at New England, noting that well over 50% of simulations have Cleveland staying within a touchdown.

This week, the model is shying away from picking the Ravens (-6.5) over the Bears despite star quarterback Lamar Jackson's return to practice. Even if Jackson suits up, he may not be at full speed after missing weeks with a hamstring injury, and the Bears are on a four-game win streak.

What a pathetic showing from that offense. Seattle kept giving Houston chances to come back and win the game, but C.J. Stroud just couldn't do anything. DeMeco Ryans, as a head coach and a former linebacker, had to be pulling his non-existent hair out. The Texans are 2-4 ATS this season, while the 49ers are 4-3 ATS.

One, they are playing their second straight road game on a short week after taking on the Lions on Monday night. Second, they are banged up with Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Bucky Irving among the notable pieces sidelined for this NFC South matchup. Despite all that, I will lay the points. While the Saints have played teams hard this season, it has hardly shown up where it matters most, as they own a 1-6 straight-up record and a 2-5 ATS mark.

White, who also serves as Fantasy and gambling editor for CBS Sports, went 718-623-37 on his ATS picks from 2017-2024, which returned more than $3,200 to $100 players. He's also 47-19 (+2439) on his last 66 picks in games involving the Packers. So does White like Jordan Love and Co. to capture a prime-time win against old Packers star Aaron Rodgers?

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Texas Longhorns made history as the first Texas team to earn the AP Poll's preseason No. 1 ranking, but Steve Sarkisian's bunch has not lived up to those expectations. That's led to some frustration in Austin, and on Saturday, hours before Texas was set to go on the road to face Mississippi State, a report emerged that Sarkisian was interested in a move to the NFL and potentially the Tennessee Titans' vacancy. That rumor got quickly shut down by Sarkisian's agent, but it was an indicator that both sides might be looking to the future in Austin. That's a major change from earlier this year when Sarkisian got another pay bump at Texas, making him one of the nation's five highest-paid coaches. After a 5-2 start and some struggles with Mississippi State on the road, it begged the question: what would it cost for either side to get out of their current deal? Steve Sarkisian contract, buyout detailsIncluding his $10.8 million salary this season, Sarkisian's contract pays him $75.8 million through the 2031 season. As part of his new deal, not only did he get a pay bump but his buyout jumped from 70% of what he was owed to 85%, which is a significant and important change. That meant coming into this season his buyout jumped to $64.4 million, and  if they decided to fire him during the year, USA Today cites his buyout for December 1 as being $60.3 million. \nIf Texas were to fire him after this season but before 2026, he would be owed $55.25 million. That is an awful lot of money, but it would not be the most we've seen paid by a team in the state of Texas, as Texas A&M paid Jimbo Fisher $75 million to leave College Station not long ago. As for Sarkisian's reported interest in jumping to the NFL, it's hard to imagine him getting paid in line with his current deal at Texas, either in annual money or contract length. On top of that, his original contract stated that he would owe to Texas $4 million if he left before the end of the 2025 season, with that figure dropping to $3 million to leave before the end of the 2026 season. \nIt seems unlikely an NFL team would jump at paying that much on top of what it would cost to bring Sarkisian from the college ranks to the pros. Texas, meanwhile, would have to be willing to pay one of the biggest buyouts in history to get rid of Sarkisian, but if there is any program in the country that could come up with $55+ million (depending on the timing of firing him), it would be the Longhorns.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Opening night was full of extremes for the Philadelphia 76ers. Joel Embiid was terrible. Not only did he finish the night with four points on nine shots, but he did so against a Celtics team that lost essentially its entire front court to injuries, free agency or trades over the summer. Philadelphia won the game because Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe went nuclear in a 74-point explosion. It was as if we were watching a franchise change hands in real time, 48 minutes of Wally Pipp getting benched for Lou Gehrig. The 2023 MVP was the past. The 24-year-old All-Star and the No. 3 overall pick were the future.That's still probably true, but Philadelphia fans can breathe easy knowing that Wednesday's Embiid is starting to feel a bit more like the aberration after a far stronger Saturday follow-up. He scored 20 points in 20 minutes, seemingly his current on-court limit right now to preserve his health. Though he's not nearly as bouncy as he was a few years ago, he moved somewhat more comfortably than he did against the Celtics in Saturday's win over the Charlotte Hornets, even notching a couple of steals. Was this the player who won MVP three years ago? No, but it was a reasonably effective player, one who may not have been able to stay out there long enough to swing the game in crunch time, but who could at least do his part earlier on to keep it close enough for his teammates to finish the job. That hasn't always been the case for essentially any of Embiid's career. He's barely played over the last two years. If Philadelphia isn't careful, that will be the case for the rest of his career.In essence, Saturday was our first glimpse at what could be the new normal in Philadelphia, one in which a carefully managed Embiid is preserved enough to have some impact rather than sitting games out entirely. His minutes limit will likely increase over time, but within reason. He's guessed that he'll never play in another back-to-back. Some Embiid is better than none at all.\nThe 76ers were never equipped for a part-time Embiid before. There are still areas in which it will be a struggle -- most notably defense. But the 76ers have never come close to this sort of shot-creation depth, and that at least offers a pathway to building a viable offense without Embiid on the floor.Maxey again led the way with 28 points on Saturday, but Quentin Grimes wasn't far behind with 24. He's become a bit of an afterthought in Philadelphia, even signing a one-year qualifying offer to become an unrestricted free agent next offseason after the 76ers failed to make a competitive offer for his services long-term, but this is someone who averaged almost 27 points per game last March. He was so good that he earned the ultimate individual distinction a bad team can bestow: he was benched in games down the stretch because he helped them win too many games. Grimes is probably a 3-and-D player on a 76ers team with a healthier Embiid gobbling up his standard possession share. On this team? He can get far closer to his post-deadline volume from last season.Jared McCain, who would've run away with Rookie of the Year had he remained healthy last season, hasn't played yet. Neither has Paul George. Remember Paul George? The podcaster who played in nine All-Star Games? Like Embiid, he probably can't approach his peak volume. But with all the shot-creation Philadelphia has accumulated in its backcourt, having him around as an ensemble shooter feels like a luxury.\nThere's probably a ceiling on this sort of team without some significant defensive addition or outrageous growth from the young players, but they're in the Eastern Conference and they're going to be able to score. That's enough to remain reasonably competitive as they attempt to figure out what comes next. As short-term formulas go, you could do a lot worse. As long-term formulas go, well, it's still not clear if The Process has technically ended yet, so let's try to stick to the short term. In that short term, the 76ers are undefeated with a compromised Embiid. If all they'll ever have is this compromised version of him, we're at least starting to see how they can win games around those limitations rather than punting entire seasons away because of them.\n            ",

Manning scrambled for a 13-yard gain on the play and was met by a defender when going down. Manning was shown walking off the field with trainers and going into the medical tent. Texas coach Steve Sarkisian had no update on Manning's status after the game.Following Manning's exit, Matthew Caldwell entered the game and threw what proved to be the winning touchdown pass -- a 10-yard strike to Emmett Mosley V. The Texas defense then got the stop it needed on the subsequent possession to get out of Starkville with a 45-38 win. Manning was banged up earlier in the game as well. He walked off the field and into the medical tent following a first-quarter touchdown run but was able to come back in the game on the following drive. The No. 22 Longhorns trailed by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter, but Manning helped lead his team back. The biggest play of the game came on special teams, however. Texas tied the game at 38 and sent the game to overtime after Ryan Niblett returned a kick 79 yards with 1:47 to play in the fourth. The Longhorns then won it in overtime to 6-2 overall and 3-1 in SEC play. It was Texas' second straight overtime road victory. The Longhorns beat Kentucky 16-13 last week. \nManning was having a career day before exiting the game. The former No. 1 overall recruit in the 2023 recruiting cycle by 247Sports completed 29 of 46 attempts for 346 yards and three touchdowns, and also added a 3-yard rushing touchdown on the ground to open the scoring for the Longhorns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LSU came into the 2025 season with lofty expectations under Brian Kelly, but after a third loss to a ranked opponent in four weeks, the Tigers are now 5-3 overall, 2-3 in SEC play and all but eliminated from College Football Playoff contention. After losing to Ole Miss at home in Week 6, LSU went on the road and lost to Vanderbilt in Week 8 before getting blasted at home 49-25 by No. 3 Texas A&M on Saturday night. The Tigers jumped out to an 18-14 halftime lead over the Aggies but were dominated 35-7 in the second half in one of the most embarrassing losses of Kelly's tenure. It was so bad that \"fire Kelly!\" chants were heard across Tiger Stadium during A&M's second-half onslaught.With No. 4 Alabama looming on the schedule following an off week, pressure is at an all-time high for Kelly to lead the Tigers to big wins if he's going to quiet the noise about his job status. With the loss on Saturday, Kelly is now 34-14 in his four seasons at LSU, where the Tigers have lost at least three games in each of his seasons in charge and failed to reach the Playoff. Given the expectation at LSU is to win national championships, that streak continuing with such a lopsided home loss certainly raises questions about whether Kelly should remain in his post leading the Tigers. \nBrian Kelly contract, buyout details Kelly signed a 10-year contract in 2021 and is making $9.4 million this season, with 6 years and $58.2 million remaining on his deal that runs through 2031. His buyout calls for Kelly to be paid 90% of his salary through the remainder of his contract, which would be $52,380,000 if he's fired after this season. If they fire him during the season, they'd add 90% of whatever is remaining of the $9.4 million he's owed for this year to that figure. Kelly, who is 63 years old, could also look at retirement after this season if he felt it was best for him to step down. We've seen a number of long-time coaches step away from college football in recent years, citing the changing landscape of revenue-sharing and NIL, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that Kelly could step away willingly -- or at least, amicably. In any case, with the coaching carousel already spinning quickly, we could see more teams entering the fray after James Franklin's firing at Penn State made it clear that no buyout is too large. Arkansas and Florida are already open, and a number of other SEC teams could be mulling coaching changes in what figures to be one of the crazier years for coaching movement. \nThat said, the $52-plus million that would be owed to Kelly is one of the 10 biggest in the sport and LSU would need to feel extremely confident it had a superior coach lined up to make that kind of decision. \n            ",

The sixth-ranked Ducks took a 7-0 lead just before halftime and doubled that advantage in the third quarter before seeing star quarterback Dante Moore leave the game with a bloody nose.Moore got clotheslined on a tackle in the third quarter by a Wisconsin defender, whose arm somehow got between his helmet and facemask and clocked the star quarterback on the bridge of his nose. Moore took his helmet off and had blood pouring from his nose after the hit as trainers came out to attend to him. \nIt was a freak incident, but a painful one for Moore. He left the game with the trainers tending to him and spent 15 minutes in the injury tent, per the Fox broadcast. Moore did return to the sideline with his helmet on, but was not in for the next Oregon offensive drive and remained on the sidelines in a parka in the fourth quarter. \nOregon turned to sophomore quarterback Brock Thomas with Moore out. Thomas came in and led a touchdown drive that was capped off with his first career passing touchdown -- one that went to Gernorris Wilson, a 6-foot-5, 318-pound lineman who was lined up as a tight end on the play. \nWith Wisconsin's offense providing no threat of a comeback, the Ducks appearing to be taking a cautious approach to their star QB's injury and rolling with Thomas, who took advantage of a chance at some extended play. Moore had a quiet game before exiting with the injury, going 9-for-15 for 86 yards through the air and minus-13 yards rushing after taking a few sacks. \nOn the season, Moore has completed 72.3% of his passes for 1,686 yards, 19 touchdowns and four interceptions in his first year as the Ducks' starter. Oregon will have a bye week next week before making a trip to Iowa to face the Hawkeyes in a challenging road test. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        While the Week 9 college football schedule did not provide as many games between ranked teams, the updated AP Top 25 poll could see even more shakeup than the week before thanks to some impactful results throughout the rankings. By the end of Saturday, a total of six ranked teams took losses in Week 9, opening plenty of room for teams to move up on voters' ballots. That's going to benefit teams with gaudy win totals as we hit the final stretch of the season, as just avoiding a loss can be as beneficial as a signature win when it comes to rankings movement. That said, one of the most notable movements we're projecting is from a quality win featuring a top 10 team. Ole Miss went into Norman as an underdog against Oklahoma, yet the Rebels jumped out to an early lead and closed the game strong to emerge with an eight-point win to improve to 7-1 on the season. Since the only loss on the season is against Georgia, in Athens, it's unlikely Ole Miss can move higher than No. 5, but look for that voting points gap to close as a response to the Rebels gusty win in the rain. Elsewhere, we're monitoring whether Texas A&M will get any first-place votes after a dominant win against LSU in Death Valley as well as if Indiana's first-place vote count will improve following the second 50+ point win of the season against a conference opponent. The No. 1 team in the country, Ohio State, was off in Week 9, so while the Buckeyes have done nothing to give up ground, they also were unable to make the kind of statement win we saw from No. 2 and No. 3. \n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Vanderbilt enters CFP bracket as SEC's fifth team, BYU flexes as new Big 12 frontrunner\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf course, with a half-dozen ranked teams losing, there is going to be some noticeable changes in the top 25 beyond shuffling inside the top 10. Some of the most dramatic changes will be in the back half of the rankings with teams benefiting from low loss counts to see big moves up either in the poll or breaking into the rankings after being unranked last week. \nHere's how we think the new AP Top 25 will look on Sunday after Week 9:1. Ohio State (Last week — 1): The Buckeyes were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week against Penn State in Columbus. 2. Indiana (2): Earlier this week, Curt Cignetti described UCLA as a 3-0 team, and it seems clear that the Bruins had the Hoosiers' attention as though they were an undefeated foe. Indiana raced out to a 35-3 halftime lead and never let up in a 56-6 victory. 3. Texas A&M (3): A thunderous result in Baton Rouge could lead to some first-place votes going the way of Texas A&M, which is now 8-0 and staring down the possibility of an all-time season in College Station. The Aggies dominated LSU in all three phases on Saturday night, handing Brian Kelly just his second-ever loss under the lights at night in Tiger Stadium.  \n4. Alabama (4): The Crimson Tide got bailed out of a tough spot at South Carolina thanks in part to the defense delivering a huge turnover in the fourth quarter that set up the game-winning score. Alabama did not play its best game, but it rose to the occasion in the crunch time on both sides of the ball and escaped Columbia with a win. 5. Georgia (5): The Bulldogs were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week against Florida in Jacksonville. 6. Ole Miss (8): Saturday's victory against Oklahoma in Norman could go down as one of the important wins of the season because it has totally flipped the postseason outlook for the Rebels and certainly has changed how they will be judged in the rankings. Labeled a slight underdog by the oddsmakers, Ole Miss overcame a second-half charge from the Sooners and scored the final nine points of the game to win 34-26. The win helps validate what we expect will be a very good record at the end of the season (7-1 for now) and keeps Ole Miss in the thick of the SEC title race.  \n7. Georgia Tech (7): There is a tough ceiling for voting points gap when it comes to upward movement, but the Yellow Jackets are continuing to pass every test put before them here in 2025. Down multiple starters, Georgia Tech rebounded from a slow start and walloped Syracuse by a 41-16 score. Haynes King totaled five touchdowns (three passing, two rushing) by the end of the rout, and Brent Key's team is now 8-0 on the season and 5-0 in ACC play. 8. Oregon (6): While Wisconsin was not threatening to win, Oregon's 21-7 victory against the Badgers was closer than expected for much of the evening. Voters won't penalize the Ducks for a double-digit win, but when it comes to tiebreakers among one-loss teams (or growing momentum for undefeated teams like Georgia Tech or BYU), this was a game that left the door open for challengers inside the top 10.  9. Vanderbilt (10): The best start since 1941 continues as Vanderbilt improved to 6-1 with a hard-fought 17-10 win against Missouri. A defensive battle from the start, the Commodores blew the game open with an 80-yard touchdown run from Makhilyn Young and then took advantage of a Missouri turnover for the game-winning score. \n10. BYU (11): The reluctance to boost BYU's ranking will be tested, because now the Cougars are 8-0 after in impressive rally and notable win at Iowa State. The Cyclones led by double-digits at two different points in the first half, but BYU flipped the game with turnovers, picking off Rocco Becht three times and returning one of them for a touchdown. It's unlikely BYU could jump Georgia Tech, but anyone else is susceptible to getting past by a Cougars team that just keeps finding ways to win.   11. Miami (9): The Hurricanes had less than a 100-point advantage on Vanderbilt and BYU, so any sways in momentum among the voters could lead to a shuffle. Considering Vanderbilt's ranked win, BYU improving to 8-0 and Miami getting off to a slow start (before eventually cruising to a win), it's possible some spots get traded around the edge of the top 10.  12. Notre Dame (12): The Fighting Irish were off in Week 9 and will be back in action next week at Boston College. \n13. Texas Tech (14): The Red Raiders needed a get-right win after a frustrating loss at Arizona State, and they drew the right opponent with Oklahoma State coming to Lubbock. It was all Texas Tech from the jump, starting with a 99-yard touchdown on the opening kickoff, and the Cowboys did not provide much resistance in the 42-0 win.  14. Tennessee (17): The Vols offense offered quite the response from last week's loss at Alabama, rolling up 504 yards of offense and 56 points against a Kentucky team that had previously fared well against some of the more talented teams in the SEC. Rankings shakeups elsewhere will lead to a slight bump up, but no major moves in the rankings for a Tennessee team that is now 6-2 with a thin margin for error the rest of the way. 15. Cincinnati (21): The Bearcats are tied with BYU in first place of the Big 12 standings with a 5-0 record in league play and now have won seven straight games after beating Baylor 41-20 at home. It's the first seven-game winning streak since the Bearcats made the College Football Playoff in 2021, and now that's the target given the team's role in the Big 12 title race. The remaining schedule is challenging with road trips to Utah and TCU as well as a home date against the aforementioned Cougars, but everything is on the table for Scott Satterfield's team heading into the final third of the season.  \n16. Virginia (16): If voters wanted to knock Virginia a spot or two on their ballots, there is some reason given the last two weeks' performances. The Wahoos were double-digit favorites against both Washington State and North Carolina yet won both games by a combined three points, so it's fair to note that this 7-1 team has not played to expectations since beating Louisville. However, that win against Louisville is a key to any ballot shakeup, so there's not much room to move down.  17. Louisville (19): The Cardinals found a tough test in a letdown spot after beating Miami with Boston College bringing four quarters of fight despite entering the game with a 1-6 record. Louisville thankfully could rise the steady hand of star running back Isaac Brown, who totaled 205 yards rushing in the win. 18. Texas (22): Don't look now, but Texas still has everything ahead of it and can still achieve its preseason goals thanks to a comeback overtime win at Mississippi State. The Longhorns were far from efficient and lost Arch Manning to injury late in the game but found a way to come back from a 17-point fourth quarter deficit to improve to 6-2 overall and 3-1 in SEC play.   \n\n        \n            \n                Texas can celebrate its historic comeback, but consecutive OT wins vs. SEC bottom feeders exposes major flaws\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n19. Oklahoma (13): The Sooners, in theory, should not see a huge drop from losing a team that will be knocking on the door of the top five heading into Week 10. But the competition for ranking spots is much less competitive when you have one loss than when you have two, and now at 6-2 we're projecting Oklahoma to be tied to its loss to Texas and its win against Michigan for placement on most ballots.  20. Missouri (15): There will be a slight drop coming for Missouri as a result of the team's second loss, but there's also a dampened outlook down the road after losing quarterback Beau Pribula to injury. True freshman Sam Zollers stepped up in a tough spot, and now he's tasked with guiding Missouri the rest of the regular season as they cling on to slimming CFP hopes.  21. Michigan (25): With Justice Haynes back in the lineup, Michigan leaned on its ground game to power through a tough start at Michigan State and pull away for a respectable double-digit win against Michigan State.  \n22. Memphis (NR): It's not going to be tough for AP voters to throw Memphis right back on their ballots as the Tigers were at No. 22 just two weeks ago before the upset loss to UAB. Though getting stunned by the Blazers netted zero voting points last week, storming back from a late deficit to take down South Florida will get them back in the 20s on a majority of ballots.  23. Navy (NR): It's time for the last unranked undefeated to break into the top 25. Navy was 30th in voting points last week, and after handling business against FAU is now 7-0 overall and 5-0 in conference play. The remaining schedule includes showdowns against the rest of the contenders in the American (), so this should get sorted out on the field but for now voters should not keep the door shut on another strong start from the Midshipmen. 24. Houston (NR): The Cougars had to hold on and nearly let a 24-point lead go on the road at Arizona State, but with some key stops late, Willie Fritz's team was able to improve to 7-1 overall. This team's only loss on the season has been to Texas Tech, so grading this as a top 25 resume in the sport should be a no-brainer. \n25. USC (NR): Though the Trojans were off off in Week 9, the team did get 97 voting points in last week's balloting. That was good enough for 26th overall and much closer to No. 25 than No. 27. With adjustments following losses to ranked teams, that could be enough ballot representation to push USC back into the top 25. Projected to drop out: No. 18 South Florida, No. 20 LSU, No. 23 Illinois, No. 24 Arizona State \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe NFL trade deadline is a little more than a week away, and among the more popular receivers being floated as possible trade candidates is the New Orleans Saints' Chris Olave. Reports have linked Olave with the Bills, Eagles, Giants, Patriots and Steelers, among others. On some levels, the Saints moving on from the 25-year-old receiver prior to the Nov. 4 deadline makes sense. New Orleans (1-6) remains one of the worst teams in the league, and their timeline to rebuild the franchise into a NFC contender doesn't align with the Olave's prime, which is arguably right now. Also, he is signed only through the 2026 season. If the team does not feel confident in its abilities to extend Olave's contract, it would benefit from getting what it can for him from a receiver-needy team with Super Bowl aspirations.But with every game this year, the price for Olave is going up. The 6-foot, 187-pound wideout is having a solid comeback season. After missing most of 2024 with multiple concussions, Olave leads New Orleans in virtually very important receiving category, including receptions (44), targets (71), receiving yards (440) and receiving touchdowns (three). He is on pace to set career highs in catches and touchdowns. In the last two weeks, he has had six catches for 98 yards against the Patriots and five catches for 98 yards and two touchdowns against the Bears. \"I feel like I'm just getting in my groove, last game, this game,\" Olave said after last week's game. \"So I feel like it's only going to get better.\"SportsLine player prop expert Alex Selesnick believes Olave is in store for another big performance on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Selesnick, who is 1,014-805 and up $3,003 on all prop picks since joining SportsLine in 2021, has made Olave Over 61.5 total receiving yards (-118) one of his top three player props for Week 8 of the NFL season.Selesnick notes that Olave has a favorable matchup against the Buccaneers. The Tampa Bay defense is giving up 229.0 passing yards per game, which ranks 21st in the league. That defense also will be without pass rusher Haason Reddick (ankle, knee), who already has been ruled out, and may be without lineman Vita Vea (foot), who is questionable.\"Olave's target share, targets per route run, first read target rate, and his expected points per game all point to untapped upside,\" Selesnick says. \"In a matchup against a Bucs defense that has been a pass funnel and is missing numerous starters, this is a spot where Olave could deliver another strong performance.\"But the speculation of the Saints' trading Olave may be a moot point. He has said that his representation and the front office have been discussing the terms of an extension \"since the beginning of the year.\"That will certainly make Saints fans happy, much like his play has.\n            ",

UFC 321 was meant to mend a long period of inactivity for the new undisputed heavyweight champion. Instead, an accidental eye poke brought Saturday's main event with Ciryl Gane to a frustrating end.Aspinall, who graduated to undisputed champion after Jon Jones vacated the title in June, was looking forward to an active title reign after being benched for most of the last two years. On Saturday, things got off to a rough start and only got worse. Challenger Gane overdelivered as an underdog, getting the better of Aspinall in the first round. Aspinall never got the chance to get going after an errant eye poke in the final 30 seconds rendered Aspinall unable to compete, leading to a no contest.Saturday's pay-per-view also crowned a new women's strawweight champion. Mackenzie Dern, empowered by her daughter cagside, cinched her second win over Virna Jandiroba to win the title vacated by Zhang Weili.Plus, Umar Nurmagomedov may not have put together the dominant showing that UFC CEO Dana White wanted, but he did pick up an important win over Mario Bautista. Nurmagomedov had to navigate some troubled waters with Bautista attempting a deep submission early and then leading a big knee late. But the prodigy of cousin Khabib Nurmagomedov did just that in a unanimous decision in which he swept the judges' scorecards. He likely awaits the winner of champion Merab Dvalishvili and Petr Yan after they meet in December.\nCBS Sports was with you throughout fight week with the latest news,  in-depth features, and betting advice to consider.

    "body": "\n        Before the SEC begins its nine-game conference schedule next season to match others across the Power Five, the league could be laughing all the way to the bank with a record number of College Football Playoff appearances at the end of the 2025 campaign.No. 10 Vanderbilt's second straight nationally ranked win on Saturday and third this season gives the Commodores the nod over several other one-loss titans in our updated Week 9 playoff projection as the SEC's fifth potential team to get an invite. Oklahoma's loss to Ole Miss was the Sooners' second of the season, detrimental to the cause considering there's still four remaining contests against top 25 teams.After its second straight road victory as an underdog despite being the Big 12's last remaining unbeaten, BYU debuts in this season's playoff projection following another big outing from freshman quarterback Bear Bachmeier. In addition, South Florida has fallen off its perch atop the Group of Five after Memphis clipped the Bulls in the final moments, revealing a new favorite in the American.\n        \n            \n                Vanderbilt off to best start since 1941 as dramatic win over Missouri keeps CFP dreams alive for Commodores\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWe're not bailing on Miami yet in the playoff conversation, but this week, the Hurricanes are on the outside looking in if the ACC only puts its champion in the bracket based on the idea of the SEC getting a fifth team in the mix. It took Miami a half of football to remove the cobwebs of last week's loss to Louisville in Saturday's win over Stanford, but when the Hurricanes finally turned it out, they routed the Cardinal. There's more work to be done down the stretch to get to the playoff.\nCollege Football Playoff Quarterfinals DateGame / LocationProjectionJan. 1 Rose BowlPasadena, Calif.(1) Ohio State vs. (8/9) WinnerJan. 1 Sugar BowlNew Orleans, La.(2) Alabama vs. (7/10) WinnerJan. 1 Orange BowlMiami, Fla.(3) Indiana vs. (6/11) WinnerDec. 31 Cotton BowlArlington, Texas(4) Texas A&M vs. (5/12) WinnerFirst roundDate LocationProjectionWinner facesDec. 19 or 20Sanford StadiumAthens, Ga.(8) Georgia vs. (9) Ole Miss(1) Ohio StateDec. 19 or 20LaVell Edwards StadiumProvo, Utah(7) BYU vs. (10) Notre Dame(2) AlabamaDec. 19 or 20Autzen StadiumEugene, Ore.(6) Oregon vs. (11) Vanderbilt (3) IndianaDec. 19 or 20Bobby Dodd StadiumAtlanta, Ga.(5) Georgia Tech vs. (12) Memphis(4) GeorgiaDon't see your team? Check out Brad Crawford's complete bowl projections.Projected College Football Playoff Field breakdown1. Ohio State (projected Big Ten champion): The Buckeyes should be a double-digit favorite over the next four games before the showdown at Michigan on Nov. 29 as Ryan Day tries to snap his losing skid to the Wolverines. It's bound to happen this season, right?2. Alabama (projected SEC champion): South Carolina struck fear in the Crimson Tide with an eight-point lead late, but Alabama managed two decisive plays in the final 2:16 to beat the Gamecocks. Alabama has now won seven straight since losing its opener and is unbeaten in SEC play. The Crimson Tide still have to play LSU and nationally ranked Oklahoma next month before traveling to Auburn in what could be Hugh Freeze's final contest with the Tigers.3. Indiana: Four total touchdowns from Fernando Mendoza helped the Hoosiers improve to 8-0 overall for only the third time in school history under second-year coach Curt Cignetti. And Indiana's four more wins away from playing top-ranked Ohio State in the Big Ten title game with playoff seeding on the line. If the Hoosiers get to Indianapolis, they've secured a first-round bye, too.4. Texas A&M: The SEC's last unblemished team through the first two months of the season, the Aggies managed their second straight tough road win Saturday night, outlasting LSU inside Tiger Stadium after beating Arkansas by a single possession in Week 8. So, why do we have an 8-0 team at No. 4 in the updated playoff projection? We're guessing there's a loss coming next month, perhaps two if the Aggies get to Atlanta and face Alabama.5. Georgia Tech (projected ACC champion): Georgia Tech moved to our projected ACC champion designation last week following Miami's loss to Louisville, and there it'll stay after trouncing Syracuse. If Brent Key's team does win the ACC with their only loss coming during rivalry weekend to Georgia, we think they'll get a first-round home game as the highest-seeded squad outside the top four.6. Oregon: The Ducks donned \"Grateful Dead\" uniforms in their win over Wisconsin but looked mostly like The Walking Dead offensively against one of the Big Ten's worst teams. Oregon's defense has played flawlessly since being gashed by Indiana earlier this month, so that's a positive sign.7. BYU (projected Big 12 champion): Cincinnati is going to get a say in this Big 12 title race as the league's only other remaining unbeaten in conference play, but for now, we're slotting BYU as the new projected champion after Saturday's win at Iowa State. The Cougars simply keep winning when most are expecting this unbeaten streak to end. The trip to Texas Tech should decide this league's playoff representative.8. Georgia: The Bulldogs get an extra week to prepare for what Florida interim coach Billy Gonzales will throw at them in Jacksonville next weekend. Georgia should roll, but you know how SEC rivalries games can go -- players get up for those regardless of prior results. If Gunner Stockton keeps it up, there's a chance he'll be a Heisman Trophy finalist this season if Georgia gets to the playoff as a top four seed and high-end finisher.9. Ole Miss: For the first time in his coaching career with the Rebels, Lane Kiffin has a road win against ranked competition in SEC play. The victory at Oklahoma was a signature mark this season for Ole Miss and all but solidified a playoff spot for the Rebels given what's left on the schedule. Most impressive was Kiffin directing his team's focus on this game and not his name in the mix for Florida's coaching vacancy. Well done.\n        \n            \n                Lane Kiffin's big win over Oklahoma is great news for Ole Miss -- but bad news for Florida coaching search\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n10. Notre Dame: The future of college athletics associated with the Fighting Irish potentially joining a conference is uncertain, but one thing is not -- Notre Dame's placement in the playoff if it gets to 10 wins. Despite only one win this season over top-25 competition (USC), the selection committee is not going to put a nine-win SEC team in the playoff -- especially if it's Vanderbilt -- over Notre Dame if the Fighting Irish win out.11. Vanderbilt: Something changed for Miami during that loss to Louisville earlier this month. A lackluster win over Stanford followed and we're not certain the Hurricanes win out from here in the ACC. Insert the Commodores as the SEC's fifth potential playoff entry (or the winner of Vanderbilt-Tennessee during rivalry weekend), which would set set the world on fire within other Power leagues wanting more bites at the apple.12. Memphis (projected Group of Five champion): A week after losing to UAB, the Tigers responded with 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to topple previous projected American champion USF and took an eraser to the league's whiteboard at the top in Week 9. Four more wins and Memphis will be in the league title game with a play-in opportunity the first weekend in December.\n            ",

The No. 10 Commodores defeated No. 15 Missouri on Saturday to improve to 7-1 for the first time since 1941. The 17-10 victory was the Commodores' second against a ranked opponent in as many weeks and third on the year, and it cemented them as both College Football Playoff and SEC title contenders heading into the final month of the regular season.Fittingly, star quarterback Diego Pavia was the one to score the winning touchdown for his Commodores. Pavia has been the face of Vanderbilt's rise toward the top of the SEC ladder over the last two seasons and is in the midst of building a Heisman Trophy résumé as strong as any in the country. He punched the ball in from a yard out with 1:52 to play to break a 10-10 tie and put Vanderbilt on top for good.That was one of two rushing scores on the day for the Commodores. Running back Makhilyn Young delivered the play of the game when he broke loose late in the third quarter for an electric 80-yard sprint -- the first touchdown for either team.\n        \n            \n                Beau Pribula injury: Missouri QB expected to miss rest of regular season after hurting ankle vs. Vanderbilt\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nVanderbilt's defense also did a solid job of containing Missouri's most formidable weapon, SEC rushing leader Ahmad Hardy. He fell short of the 100-yard mark for just the third time this season. The Tigers also had to overcome the loss of quarterback Beau Pribula, who left the game with a serious ankle injury.\nThis is just the fourth time in program history that Vanderbilt has topped the seven-win mark in consecutive seasons. It is a feat that occurred just twice this century with former coach James Franklin accounting for the previous accomplishment in 2012-13.The Commodores also never had more than one victory over an AP Top 25 opponent in a season until this year. In fact, their four wins over ranked teams matches their total from 1975 to 2023 combined. There is ample time to add to their tally before the end of the campaign, although their next chance may not come until the regular-season finale against No. 17 Tennessee, their in-state rival.\nVanderbilt's tremendous start to the season begs the question, \"How far can the Commodores go?\" The first double-digit-win campaign in school history is well within reach. And as long as they hit that threshold by the end of the regular season, they should have a strong enough case to get into the playoff for the first time and perhaps even host a first-round game.\n            \n    ",

Brown as the NFL's Nov. 4 trade deadline approaches, according to ESPN. Teams around the league are \"eyeing Brown,\" but it would take a \"blockbuster offer\" for the Eagles to trade Brown, per ESPN.There was some buzz earlier this month that Philadelphia could be open to a move after Brown released a few cryptic social media posts that seemed to point at his discontent with the franchise. Brown later cleared the air while admitting that he was frustrated with the state of Philadelphia's offense to start the season. \"This is home. This is my home,\" Brown said Oct 1. \"Unfortunately, I did it to myself. I won't say 'unfortunately.' I did it to myself. This is my home.

He made the earlier social media posts after a two-catch, seven-yard performance in the Eagles' Week 4 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Though Brown is averaging a career-low 56.4 yards per game, Philadelphia has made an effort to get Brown more involved in the offense in the weeks since. His performance against the Vikings was his best of the season. Brown has been ruled out for Sunday's game vs. the New York Giants because of a hamstring injury, but he's not expected to be sidelined for long. \nBrown has eclipsed 1,000 yards receiving in each of his three seasons with Philadelphia after the Eagles acquired him in a trade with the Tennessee Titans during the 2022 NFL Draft. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nIt's El Clásico time as Real Madrid and Barcelona meet with first place in LaLiga on the line. Entering the match, Los Blancos lead the league by two points over Barcelona, but Xabi Alonso will look to end a five-match losing streak to his rivals. In Barcelona's LaLiga winning season last campaign, victories over Real Madrid were critical to securing the title, as not only do they lead to points in the table, but the psychological blows that losing this match can bring are also critical. Barcelona are already throwing barbs via Lamine Yamal, who recounted the last time that he went to the Bernebeau, Barcelona won 4-0, but the young star will need to back up those words. Without Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, Barcelona's fate will be on his shoulders as Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid will put Wojciech Szczesny under immense pressure in net.Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:How to watch Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, oddsDate: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 11:15 a.m. ETLocation: Estadio Santiago Bernabeu -- Madrid, SpainTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Real Madrid -115; Draw +340; Barcelona +250Last meetingIf this match is anything like when these two last met in May near the end of the LaLiga season, we're all in for a treat. Real Madrid went ahead by two goals in the first 15 minutes via a brace from Kylian Mbappe before Barcelona stormed back. Barcelona scored four goals in the first half, including a brace by Raphinha. While Real Madrid did score again late, for Mbappe to complete a hat trick, it wouldn't be enough, eventually falling to their rivals.HistoryIn competitive fixtures, this will be the 262nd meeting between he two teams. A Barcelona victory would level the series between the duo as it currently stands with 105 Real Madrid wins, 104 Barcelona wins, and 52 draws. In LaLiga specifically, Real Madrid have won 79 matches to Barcelona's 76.Injury updatesReal Madrid come into the match with two defensive injuries as David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger are set to miss out on the match. Given that neither has been among the first-choice options in the back line, that only hurts the strength of the Madrid bench more than anything. For Hansi Flick's Barcelona, it's quite a different story as he's missing four starters. Joan Garcia and Marc Andre ter Stegen are both out, leaving him with his third-choice keeper, and both Gavi and Dani Olmo are missing from the midfield, while the attack will be down Lewandowski and Raphinha. That forces an entire rethink in the Barcelona attack, where Yamal and Marcus Rashford will be key to Barcelona's performance here. Predicted lineupsReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Alvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen, Eder Militao, Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham, Aurelien Tchouameni, Franco Mastantuono, Arda Guler, Vinicius Junior, Kylian MbappeBarcelona: Wojciech Szczesny, Alejandro Balde, Ronald Araujo, Pau Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, Marcus Rashford, Fermin Lopez, Lamine Yamal, Ferran TorresPlayer to watchMarcus Rashford, Barcelona: Without Lewandowski, all eyes will be on Rashford's performance. Since joining from Manchester United during the summer, he has been finding his form with five goals and six assists in only 12 appearances. Popping up on the left wing or as a striker, Rashford has added to Flick's depth, keeping the team afloat during their current injury crisis. Coming into facing Real Madrid in form, the pressure will be on Rashford to add to his goal tally. Flick has had faith in the English forward and it has paid off, but he'll need more to keep things going.PredictionBarcelona's injuries will prove to be too much to overcome in this match. Real Madrid are a team that can beat the offside trap which sets things up for Mbappe to score a brace in his home stadium. Opening up a five-point lead atop LaLiga with a win, this will be step one to Real Madrid's eventual title win as Xabi Alonso's team are well and truly back. Pick: Real Madrid 3, Barcelona 1\n            ",

One of his top NFL player props for Week 8 is Patriots quarterback Drake Maye going Over 19.5 completions (-122) versus Cleveland on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.\"The Cleveland Browns have a great rush defense and will likely force the Patriots to be more one-dimensional than they prefer. This is in spite of the fact that the Patriots will be playing from the lead. Look for the Browns to stymie the run and create their typical great pass rush, which will lead to Maye getting the ball out quickly in the short area. Don't expect Rhamondre Stevenson and company to be effective in this one and look for an already very accurate quarterback to pepper his targets as an extension of the run game.\" You can see all of Nejad's NFL picks here.You can also use the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets instantly:Top Week 8 NFL expert picks from Larry HartsteinA veteran CBS Sports and SportsLine NFL expert, Hartstein is on a sizzling 15-7 run on NFL spread picks, returning nearly $725 for $100 bettors. This week, he's backing the Bengals (-6) against the Jets.\"Joe Flacco isn't the only reason the Bengals have new life. Their defense has shown modest progress under first-year coordinator Al Golden, who has benched vets like Cam Taylor-Britt and Logan Wilson at the expense of promising young players. After having to face Jared Goff, Jordan Love and Aaron Rodgers in succession, Cincy now will prepare for Justin Fields or Tyrod Taylor. The winless Jets are dealing with injuries to Sauce Gardner (concussion), Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall.\" See all of Hartstein's SportsLine picks here.\nTop Week 8 NFL expert picks from Matt SeveranceMatt Severance is a high-volume handicapper who is 13-6 (+615) over his last 19 ATS picks in Packers games. For Green Bay vs. Pittsburgh on Sunday Night Football, Severance is backing the Steelers (+3) to cover at home.\"Generally not an early jumper on NFL, but I was definitely looking at this pro-Steelers right off the bat because Aaron Rodgers will be so fired up to light up the Packers like he's on an all-time ayahuasca trip. Bit surprised we got the hook this early in the week if not surprised overall that Pittsburgh is even getting a field goal at home unless I'm missing a TJ Watt injury or something (nope).

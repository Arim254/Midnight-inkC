    "body": "\n        Following a Week 10 slate in the NFL that felt as though it were straight out of an alternate dimension, the league had more chalky results in Week 11. Miami's performance over the past two weeks may be working the franchise out of quarterback range if it elects to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. The Dolphins' latest victory came at the expense of Washington, which is back in top 10 overall projection after a trip to the NFC Championship game. Looking ahead, there are two games involving opponents currently in position to pick in the top 10: Browns at Raiders and Falcons at Saints -- the latter being the first of two meetings between the teams this season. As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals.\nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order, per Tankathon, as well as potential team needs:1. Tennessee Titans (1-9)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGETennessee scored a touchdown late to push Houston to the brink of overtime, but Davis Mills executed a drive that set up a last-second game-winning field goal. The Titans remain the league's only one-win team. 2. New York Giants (2-9)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTJameis Winston brought some much-needed energy after losing Jaxson Dart to a concussion. New York had an early lead and didn't go down without a fight, but ultimately succumbed to the Packers. \n3. Cleveland Browns (2-8)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland's defense did everything in its power to give the team a chance to win this game, but the offense was limited with Dillon Gabriel and even more so when Shedeur Sanders was forced into action. A meaningful game, in relation to the draft order, against the Raiders is on the docket for next week. 4. New Orleans Saints (2-8)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans was on a bye this week after winning in Week 10. 5. New York Jets (2-8)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEJustin Fields and the Jets jumped out to an early lead on Thursday Night Football, but the Patriots eventually pulled away.6. Las Vegas Raiders (2-8)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas was no match for the Cowboys in a 33-16 loss on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n7. Washington Commanders (3-8)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRIt was Marcus Mariota under center for the Commanders in Spain. They continue to fall out of the playoff picture a year after appearing in the NFC Championship Game. 8. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (3-7)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLLos Angeles' pick from Atlanta continues to rise as the Falcons suffered an overtime loss to the Panthers on Sunday.9. Cincinnati Bengals (3-7)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGECincinnati was without Joe Burrow, but Pittsburgh would be without Aaron Rodgers by the end of the afternoon. Burrow is slated to make his anticipated return on Thanksgiving or shortly thereafter, but the Bengals may be too far out of the hunt.\n10. Arizona Cardinals (3-7)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBJacoby Brissett completed an NFL-record 47 passes on Sunday against the 49ers to little avail. San Francisco nearly doubled them up at home.11. Miami Dolphins (4-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami has won back-to-back games for the first time this season. Once perceived to be dead in the water, the Dolphins have life in the wake of general manager Chris Grier's dismissal. 12. Minnesota Vikings (4-6)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBJ.J. McCarthy and Caleb Williams each completed exactly 50% of their pass attempts Sunday. McCarthy led a late scoring drive to take the lead, but the Vikings defense surrendered a late scoring drive of their own.\n13. Dallas Cowboys (4-5-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDefensive tackle Quinnen Williams made a huge impact in his Cowboys debut, helping Dallas secure a blowout victory.14. Baltimore Ravens (5-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBCleveland played Baltimore close but was swept by its division rival in the regular season. Baltimore has now worked its way back to .500 after starting the season 1-5.15. Kansas City Chiefs (5-5)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TETravis Kelce willed his way into the end zone late against Denver, but the Broncos responded with a last-second field goal to win the game.\n16. Houston Texans (5-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SThe Texans are back to .500 on the season having won three of their past four games. Davis Mills was once again at quarterback, and Houston needed a last-second field goal to escape the Titans. 17. Carolina Panthers (6-5)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina needed a late touchdown from Bryce Young to Tetairoa McMillan to send the game into overtime. There, the Panthers kicked a field goal to secure their fifth win over the past seven.18. Detroit Lions (6-4)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit drops to third in the NFC North after getting shut down by the Eagles on \"Sunday Night Football.\" \n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe AFC East has been unkind to Tampa Bay over the past two weeks. The Buccaneers went 0-2 after being competitive in both games. 20. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (6-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville's game against Los Angeles was important to its playoff odds. The Jaguars scored early and continued to pile on for a convincing, morale-building victory.21. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-4)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLTight end Darnell Washington and the Steelers offense ran through a vulnerable Cincinnati defense. It was an important win for Pittsburgh knowing that Baltimore is gaining in the rearview mirror. \n22. Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLThe Chargers were a no-show in what amounted to a midseason playoff game. The offensive line has been ravaged by injuries, but the franchise has to find a way to pull out some wins.23. San Francisco 49ers (7-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TEBrock Purdy returned to the starting lineup for Kyle Shanahan's offense, but it was the George Kittle show. The veteran tight end had two touchdowns against division rival Arizona.  24. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (6-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBMalik Willis had to come into the game for Jordan Love at one point against a Giants team that was also without its starting quarterback. Jordan Love was able to play most of this game, but it was a rushing attack by committee that pushed Green Bay over the top. \n25. Chicago Bears (7-3)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTIt was not exactly an explosive day for either offense, but the Bears continue to win games they would have found a way to lose in the past.   26. Buffalo Bills (7-3)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRBuffalo's game against Tampa Bay was much closer than the final score suggested. After going back and forth for most of the afternoon, the Bills put their foot on the gas late to salt away a two-score win. 27. Seattle Seahawks (7-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRMatthew Stafford did not need to do much for the Rams because Sam Darnold did all the work for them. Darnold had his worst day as a Seahawk by throwing four interceptions. 28. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-2)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLIndianapolis must be feeling good about itself sitting at 8-2 during its bye week.29. Los Angeles Rams (8-2)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLKyren Williams nearly had as many rushing yards as Matthew Stafford had passing, but the Rams didn't need to do much more than protect the football against Seattle. 30. New England Patriots (9-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEDrake Maye and the Patriots continue to take care of business against lesser foes. An easy schedule continues the rest of the season.31. Philadelphia Eagles (8-2)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia retains the No. 1 seed in the NFC over the Rams with a dominating defensive effort against Detroit.32. Denver Broncos (9-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTIt has not always been pretty for the Broncos this season, but they have positioned themselves as well as any other team in the AFC. Sunday's win over Kansas City was important from a narrative perspective in addition to the pecking order in the AFC West.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

With Quinnen Williams on the field for the first time since being traded to Dallas, the Cowboys defense dominated in a 33-16 win over the Las Vegas Raiders. Not only did Williams play, but so did Logan Wilson, who was shipped from Cincinnati to Dallas just before the Nov. 4 trade deadline. The Cowboys had a bye last week, so both guys had to wait nearly two weeks before making their Dallas debut.The Cowboys also had two defensive players make their 2025 season debut in DeMarvion Overshown and Shavon Revel Jr. Overshown hadn't played since last December when he tore both his ACL and MCL. As for Revel, the 2025 third-round pick had been making his way back from a torn ACL that he suffered during his final year in college. As if that's not enough, the Cowboys also saw the return of safeties Malik Hooker and Donovan Wilson. Hooker had been sidelined by a toe injury since Week 4 while Wilson had been out since Week 7 due to an elbow injury. With the Cowboys defense finally healthy, the unit came out and dominated. \nWith that in mind, let's get to the grades, starting with the Cowboys big win.  Dallas 33-16 over Las VegasPhiladelphia 16-9 over DetroitBuffalo 44-32 over Tampa BayDenver 22-19 over Kansas CityL.A.

    "body": "\n        With the latest DraftKings promo code, new users can take advantage of $200 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. The Cowboys will visit the Raiders on Monday Night Football. The Cowboys are averaging 29.2 points per game this season, including scoring at least 27 in four of their last six games. Meanwhile, the Raiders have been held to seven points or fewer in two of their last three games. The offensive discrepancies are why the SportsLine Projection Model is backing the Cowboys to cover as 3.5-point favorites as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Cowboys vs. Raiders is 49.5 points, according to the latest NFL odds. The model also sees value in playing the Clippers to cover as 5.5-point underdogs against the 76ers in NBA action. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has a best bet on Oilers vs. Sabres in the NHL. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 11 on a 47-32 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookCowboys (-3.5) vs. Raiders (-108)Clippers (+5.5) vs. 76ers (-112)Sabres (+1.5) vs. Oilers (-198) Combining the model's three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +448 (risk $100 to win $448). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nCowboys (-3.5) vs. Raiders (-108)The Dallas offense hasn't been as dominant over its last two games, which resulted in losses of 44-24 against the Broncos and 27-17 against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys had additional time to game plan for this one coming off a bye, and the Raiders rank in the bottom half of the league in many defensive statistics. Las Vegas has the No. 20 scoring defense (24.4 ppg allowed), and the Raiders have allowed at least 30 points in two of their last three games. Meanwhile, the model doesn't project the Raiders to be able to keep pace with Dallas' offense, whether the Cowboys are at their best or just average, as the Raiders rank 31st in scoring at 15.4 ppg this year. The model projects the Cowboys to cover in 57% of simulations. Back the Dallas at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Clippers (+5.5) vs. 76ers (-112)The Clippers have been hit hard with injuries this season, but so have the 76ers. Philadelphia will be without Joel Embiid (knee) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (knee). Paul George (knee) is questionable. The Clippers were hoping for a Big Three this year of James Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Bradley Beal, but Beal is out for the season with a hip injury, and Leonard has played just six games while dealing with a foot injury. Harden has done his part, though, averaging 26 points and nine assists per game this season, with Ivica Zubac adding 16.2 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. Harden is averaging 39 points over his last two games, and the Clippers went 1-1 with their loss coming by three points over that span. Meanwhile, the 76ers have lost two of their last three games and haven't covered a 5.5-point spread in any of their last three games. The model projects the Clippers to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Clippers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Sabres (+1.5) vs. Oilers (-198) \"Bit of a trap game potential for Edmonton after winning a possible Cup Finals preview on Saturday at Carolina and then with Alex Ovechkin and the Caps up next.\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"The Oilers are 4-6-2 away. Buffalo is last in the Atlantic Division but 5-3-2 at home and off one of the team's better efforts of the year on Saturday in Detroit. The return of captain and blueliner Rasmus Dahlin, a former No. 1 overall pick, from a personal leave made an obvious difference in that huge comeback win.\" Back the Sabres at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Monday Night Football, NBA, NHL picks?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

They did not specify what prompted that decision. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram has reported that the two receivers were benched after \"they missed some things.\"\nWith their top-two receivers on the bench, Dallas quickly punted after gaining just six yards on its first three plays. The Cowboys started the game with two runs by Javonte Williams before Dak Prescott was unable to connect with wideout Jalen Tolbert on third down. \nBoth Lamb and Pickens returned for the Cowboys' second drive, which ended with Raiders Pro Bowl pass rusher Maxx Crosby recording a strip-sack of Prescott. Like the Cowboys' first drive, their second drive started with two Williams runs before Prescott attempted a pass. It's safe to say that no one had Lamb and Pickens starting the game on the sideline on their proverbial bingo card. They are, after all, two of Dallas' three best skill players and are one of the best receiving duos in the NFL. \nPickens currently leads the Cowboys with 49 receptions for his 764 yards and six touchdowns. Lamb, a four-time Pro Bowl player who missed three games this season due to injury, is second on the team with 491 receiving yards. \n            \n    ",

These chargers were issued Monday by Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson. Irving, 27, is accused of shooting and killing Beam last week at the Laney Fieldhouse sports facility. Beam, 66, died the next morning, hours after Irving was located following a manhunt. Dickson said that Beam's shooting, in addition to a second shooting last week at Oakland's Skyline High School, has led to her office to reinstitute mandatory minimum sentences in gun cases in Alameda County. \nDickson did not relate details about Beam's shooting, and police have not released any information about a motive in the shooting, which is being called a \"very targeted incident.\" Dickson did confirm that Irving made statements to police officers about the shooting, but did not provide details about what was said.\n        \n            \n                Bears' Nahshon Wright pays tribute to late coach John Beam with interception: 'That one was for him'\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile he was not a student or an employee at Laney College, Irving was known to be a loiter around the camps area. He played football at Skyline High School, which is where Beam coached before he was hired at Laney. Beam did not coach Irving during his time at Skyline. A lifetime Californian, Beam rose to national fame when he and Laney's football team were featured in Netflix's \"Last Chance U\" series. He spent 25 years as a high school coach that included 17 seasons as Skyline's head coach (compiling a 160-33-3 record that included 15 Oakland Athletic League championships and 11 Oakland Section titles) before joining Laney's staff in 2004. \nBeam was promoted to head coach in 2012 and remained in that position through the 2024 season.

    "body": "\n        The San Antonio Spurs announced star big man Victor Wembanyama will miss time with a left calf strain suffered in a loss to the Warriors on Friday night. Wembanyama sat out the Spurs' win over the Kings on Sunday night and is now expected to be out of action for at least a few weeks, per Shams Charania. A firm timetable for his return was not provided, but the San Antonio Express-News reports he will be re-evaluated in two or three weeks.   Wembanyama has gotten off to a phenomenal start to his third season in the league, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.1 steals per game on 50.2/34.5/85.7 shooting splits. Thanks to Wembanyama's emergence as one of the game's most dominant two-way figures, the Spurs have raced out to a 9-4 record and sit in fifth place in the Western Conference.If he were to miss three weeks of action, that would mean Wembanyama would be out for 10 games. For a player who became the early yet heavy favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year and put himself at least in the conversation for Most Valuable Player, a 10-game absence would leave him with little margin to fulfill the NBA's new 65-game requirement for major individual awards. \nWembanyama would only be able to miss seven additional games the remainder of the season to retain award eligibility. Given teams generally ease players back into action after calf strains -- limit the number of back-to-backs they play -- his awards candidacy could be in serious jeopardy. Thunder big man Chet Holmgren (+130) moved into being the new DPOY favorite at FanDuel, with Wembanyama (+400) sliding to second with the news of his injury. On the court, the Spurs will have to lean on De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and their talented backcourt in Wembanyama's absence. San Antonio's performance against Sacramento offered a glimpse into how they can still find success without Wembanyama, pushing the tempo and leaning on their offensive talent without their defensive anchor on the floor. Luke Kornet got the start at center against the Kings and veteran Kelly Olynyk moved into the backup role. The Spurs will have two more home games to figure out their plan without Wembanyama before a heavy road stretch with six of their next seven games away from San Antonio, including difficult matchups with Denver, Minnesota, Orlando and Cleveland. \nvs. Grizzliesvs. Hawksat Sunsat Blazersat Nuggetsat Timberwolvesvs. Grizzliesat Magic at CavaliersOnly 1.5 games separate the Spurs in fifth from the Suns in eighth in the West, and the next few weeks will be a serious early season challenge for Mitch Johnson's group in learning how to handle adversity without their star. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shedeur Sanders' house was burglarized on Sunday, the same day he received his first regular-season NFL action, multiple sources, including cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot, reported Monday.It's unclear if anything was stolen. No suspects have been identified.Sanders, 23, made his official NFL debut during the second half of the Browns' 23-16 loss to the Ravens after Cleveland's starting quarterback, Dillon Gabriel, went into concussion protocol during halftime. Sanders finished 4 for 16 for 47 yards with an interception and two sacks taken.The Browns, who led 16-10 when Sanders entered, managed just four first downs in the second half. It was not only Sanders' first NFL game, but his first time working with the first-team offense, coach Kevin Stefanski said after the game -- a difficult situation but not at all uncommon for a backup quarterback.\n\"I don't think I played good at all,\" Sanders said after his debut. \"I think it's a lot of things we need to look at during the week and go and just get comfortable even throwing routes with Jerry [Jeudy] and throwing routes with all those guys. I think that was my first ball to him all year. But other than that, I just think overall we just gotta go next week and understand so then we have a week to prepare stuff I like to do.\"Sanders is expected to get his first NFL start in Week 12 against the Raiders and will have to prepare while dealing with the break-in as well.Sanders is one of several notable athletes whose house has been broken into while the in the past year-plus. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce's homes were burglarized during the 2024 season, as was Joe Burrow's. In February 2025, federal prosecutors charged seven men -- alleged members of a South American crime syndicate -- with conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. All of those burglaries occurred when those players were out of town for games; Sanders and the Browns were home Sunday.\nThe break-ins have not been limited to the NFL. In late December, 2024, the house of Luka Dončić, then with the Mavericks, was burglarized, with about $30,000 worth of jewelry stolen. Timberwolves guard Mike Conley and Bucks forward Bobby Portis were also victims of similar crimes. The FBI warned sports leagues about crime organizations targeting athletes' homes shortly after the Dončić incident. The NFL and NBA issued memos to its players a month earlier.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Brian Kelly Era in Baton Rouge ended on October 26, and the LSU football coaching search underway after the Tigers parted ways with Kelly before the team's bye week. His final act as the LSU head coach saw his team embarrassed in a 49-25 home loss to Texas A&M on Saturday, thus ending Kelly's tenure after three-plus seasons and a 34-14 (.708 record). While Kelly racked up plenty of victories with the Tigers, he failed to win the SEC in any year, and LSU's 13 losses as a ranked team under his spell are the most of any team in the nation since he took over in 2022. Frank Wilson is serving as the interim, and LSU fell 20-9 at Alabama in his debut in Week 11, but bounced back to beat Arkansas 23-22 in Week 12.The prior three LSU football coaches -- Ed Orgeron, Les Miles and Nick Saban -- all won national titles within their first four years at the school, which only magnified the lack of meaningful success for Kelly.

Sanders, who played the entire second half, largely struggled against a Baltimore defense that is currently ranked 24th in the NFL in passing yards allowed. Sanders went 4 of 12 passing for 47 yards and an interception while not directing a single scoring drive. \nHe and the Browns' offense did make things interesting during the game's final three minutes. On Cleveland's final drive, Sanders completed a 25-yard pass to tight end Harold Fannin Jr., a 10-yard pass to wideout Jerry Jeudy and took off on a five-yard run that put the Browns in scoring position. The game ended, however, with Sanders throwing three straight incompletions as Cleveland fell to 2-8 on the year after relinquishing a 16-10 halftime lead. While it was a humble start, Sanders' NFL debut created a buzz from fans who have been anticipating his first regular season action. Sanders, after all, was one of college football's most popular and polarizing players the previous two years during his time at Colorado. \nRest assured that a similar buzz will be hovering over next Sunday's game in Las Vegas, assuming that Sanders does indeed start in place of Gabriel. \n            \n    ",

Those seeking NFL picks will likely gravitate towards Cowboys when filling out daily Fantasy lineups considering they rank fourth in scoring offense. Dak Prescott, Javonte Williams, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens will be popular selections, but some helpful NFL DFS advice would be to not overlook Raiders players, despite Vegas having the No. 31 scoring offense.The team trading away Jakobi Meyers created a receiving void, as several under-the-radar Vegas pass catchers could bubble up to the surface. While Ashton Jeanty and Brock Bowers were likely already under consideration for your 'Monday Night Football' DFS strategy, others could also provide an immense return on investment if they can break through against a Dallas defense that has struggled, but will get reinforcements in the form of defensive lineman Quinnen Williams and linebacker Logan Wilson via trades.Before making any NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

The four-time Pro Bowler is coming off back-to-back seven-catch games and ranks sixth in the NFL with 81.8 receiving yards per game. However, if you take away the game in which he injured his ankle, playing just seven snaps and getting no targets, Lamb's 98.2 yards would rank second in the league. The Raiders have given up the sixth-most Fantasy points to opposing wideouts, so inserting Lamb into MNF DFS lineups is a no-brainer. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Raiders tight end Michael Mayer. Vegas' other tight end shouldn't be overlooked as he has standalone value even with Bowers back in the lineup. After trading away Meyers, Mayer played 37 snaps last week, as Tre Tucker was the only Raiders wideout who played more. Averaging 27 yards with one total touchdown over his last four games, all starts, Mayer is a low-cost, high-upside option for Monday. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Cowboys vs. RaidersMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        Aaron Rodgers is slated to make history that he likely didn't anticipate making during his first season with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Rodgers, who is reportedly dealing with a minor fracture in his left wrist that was sustained during the Steelers' win over the Bengals on Sunday, is in position to join another notable Pittsburgh quarterback who played with a broken left wrist. That quarterback was none other than Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw, who played the majority of the 1977 season with a broken left wrist after he sustained the injury during a Week 4 loss to the Oilers. Bradshaw's injury that day, in addition to an in-game injury to backup Mike Kruczek, led to then-Steelers rookie defensive back and future Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy playing quarterback for a significant portion of the game. Dungy, a former college quarterback for Minnesota, made NFL history that day by becoming the first player to throw and record an interception in the same game. Despite the injury, Bradshaw didn't miss a start the remainder of the year. He threw for a then-career-high 2,523 yards, but he also threw more interceptions (19) than touchdown passes (17) for a Pittsburgh team that finished 9-5. In the first round of the playoffs, Bradshaw threw three more interceptions as Pittsburgh fell to the eventual AFC champion Broncos. \nWhile many assumed Pittsburgh's dynasty was over following its second straight non-Super Bowl season, the Steelers instead capped off the 1970s by becoming the first team to win four Super Bowls. The Steelers also became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice. The catalyst for much of that success was Bradshaw, who took full advantage of the NFL's new rules that prohibited defenses while encouraging higher-scoring games. In 1978 (the first year the new rules were in effect), Bradshaw won league and Super Bowl MVP honors as Pittsburgh dethroned the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. Pittsburgh successfully defended its title a year later as Bradshaw became the second player in history (the first being former Packers quarterback Bart Starr) to win multiple Super Bowl MVPs. \nNearly 50 years after Bradshaw played with a broken left wrist, Rodgers is reportedly trying to do the same thing this weekend in Chicago against a Bears franchise that he tormented during his time with the Packers. \nIncluding the playoffs, Rodgers went 25-5 against the Bears during his years in Green Bay, a record that inspired him to declare that he \"owns\" the franchise during a 2021 win in the Windy City, a place the Steelers haven't won in since 1995. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In seemingly a New York minute, the 2-8 Jets have made the abrupt decision to change quarterbacks. New York coach Aaron Glenn is turning the keys of the offense over to veteran Tyrod Taylor, who is taking over for former first-round pick Justin Fields. A 2021 first-round pick of the Bears, Fields had three up-and-down years with the Bears before having a career resurgence last season in Pittsburgh. He went 4-2 as the Steelers quarterback, accounting for 10 total touchdowns while throwing just one interception. Fields has continued to do a better job of taking care of the football in New York, but his lack of overall production -- combined with the Jets' record -- compelled Glenn to make a change at quarterback with seven games left in the 2025 regular season. \nWhile he still has another year left on his contract, it's safe to say that there's a good chance that Fields and the Jets part ways sometime before the start of next season. With that in mind, here's a look at some of Fields' possible future landing spots. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Vikings Minnesota makes sense on multiple fronts. In addition to the likelihood of being in the market for a backup quarterback, the Vikings may be looking for competition to help push starter J.J. McCarthy, who has struggled to live up to his early season promise since coming back from his ankle injury. The Vikings also make sense given the history Kevin O'Connell has had with former first-round picks. Sam Darnold, for example, parlayed his one season with O'Connell into a long-term opportunity with the Seahawks. It's possible that he could have a similar impact on Fields, who has shown flashes of his potential throughout his five-year career. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens Fields would give Baltimore another option behind Lamar Jackson in the event the two-time league MVP has another injury that would cause him to miss time. The Ravens' current backup is Tyler Huntley, a former Pro Bowler who led Baltimore to a season-saving win over the Bears back in Week 8. \nLike Huntley and Jackson, Fields is exceptional with his feet, which should make him a natural fit inside Baltimore's offense. Like Huntley, one would expect that offensive coordinator Todd Monken wouldn't have to make too many changes to the game for Fields, whose 1,143 yards rushing during the 2022 season are second to only Jackson's 1,206 yards during the 2019 season in terms of single-season rushing yards by a quarterback. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersLos Angeles will make a lot of sense if Trey Lance doesn't re-sign this offseason. Jim Harbaugh is familiar with Fields' game having coached against him during his time at Michigan. In 2019, Fields helped lead Ohio State to a 56-21 win over Harbaugh's Wolverines. Fields enjoyed one of his finest games as Buckeye that day, throwing for 302 yards and four touchdowns. His performance was complemented by the running of current Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins, who rumbled for 211 yards and four touchdowns on 31 carries. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins Miami could use an upgrade behind starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, as the current backups are Zach Wilson and rookie Quinn Ewers. In Fields, the Dolphins would be getting a significant upgrade in terms of who they have backing up Tagovailoa. Fields' skill set also seems like a good fit for Mike McDaniel's offense. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Steelers Pittsburgh makes sense only if Aaron Rodgers doesn't return for the 2025 season and the Steelers don't take a quarterback early in this year's draft. If they have a roster spot to fill at quarterback, it's conceivable to think that the Steelers would consider re-signing Fields given their previous history together. As noted above, Fields showed significant growth during his brief time with the Steelers that contributed to their 4-2 start last season. That success could lead to a reunion in 2026, whether as a backup or a possible QB1 option. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs continue on Sunday with the AFC Championship Game and the NFC Championship Game. Patriots vs. Broncos (+3.5) kicks off at 3 p.m. ET, followed by Rams vs. Seahawks (-2.5) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Those who've made NFL picks against the spread all year are probably aware that New England and Seattle each have a league-high of 13 spread wins this season. The Rams (12) are just behind them, but with Denver having just eight ATS victories, the Broncos could be ones to fade with Championship Round NFL predictions.While that could have you leaning towards one side in the AFC title game, what should you make of the NFC Championship Game with your NFL bets? They split their two regular season matchups both versus the line and outright, with the Rams winning the first by two points and the Seahawks winning the second by one point. Before locking in any Championship Round NFL picks or NFL prop bets, be sure to check out the Championship Round NFL best bets and predictions from SportsLine's red-hot Vegas experts. SportsLine has more than 40 hand-picked Vegas experts who excel in multiple spots.

WhiteWhite, CBS Sports' managing editor of Fantasy and gambling, is 21-15-1 (+445) on his last 37 over/under picks. For Patriots vs. Broncos, he is backing Under 42.5.\"The Patriots defense has run roughshod over a pair of offenses with major injury concerns the last two weeks, and they'll get another with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback. Playcaller Zak Kuhr is in his bag, completely outmaneuvering the Chargers and Texans, and Stidham faces an uphill battle to score points. Drake Maye's offense has struggled with turnovers against two top-tier defenses and gets another here, and the margin between the Broncos and second place in sacks was more than the gap between No. 2 and 9. Maybe another defensive score ruins this Under like it did last week in Texans-Pats, but I have to back it above the key number of 41.\" See all of White's picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop NFL picks from Alex SelesnickA prop-bet specialist, Selesnick, who is better known as PropStarz, has returned nearly 45 units since joining SportsLine. He enters this weekend on a 61-44 roll on NFL player props that has returned nearly $1,000 for $100 players. This week, PropStarz is going Over 21.5 receiving yards for Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III.\"Walker has cleared this line in seven of eleven games since the Seahawks Week 9 bye. This, of course, is despite an almost 50/50 route share split with Zach Charbonnet. With the latter back out for the season, I expect Walker to take on a bigger role, which should include more pass plays. It's a great matchup for him, as the Rams allowed the fifth most receiving yards to running backs in the regular season (38 yards per game), with an opposing back clearing this line in nine of their last eleven games. This includes Walker's 64-yard and 44-yard performances (Charbonnet with six total targets and 32 yards as well). I'd bet this up to over 20.5.\" See the rest of PropStarz's picks here, and bet that prop here:\nHow to make Championship Round NFL picksSportsLine's team of experts also includes Brady Kannon, a former SuperContest winner who enters the Championship Round on a sizzling 28-14 run (67%) on NFL spread picks, returning over $1,200 for $100 players. You can find out who his NFL picks are this weekend here. If you are looking for NFL picks, NFL props, or NFL best bets for the Championship Round, SportsLine has you covered with its proven team of experts.

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers have reached an agreement to hire Mike McCarthy as their next coach, the team announced. McCarthy is set to succeed Mike Tomlin while becoming only the team's fourth head coach since Chuck Noll was hired way back in 1969.  A Pittsburgh native, the 62-year-old McCarthy took the 2025 season off after spending the previous five seasons as the Dallas Cowboys' coach. Before that, he enjoyed a 13-year run as the Green Bay Packers' coach that was highlighted by Green Bay's victory over the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. In 18 seasons as a head coach, McCarthy has compiled a 174-112-2 regular season record and an 11-11 record in the postseason. He's coached in the playoffs 12 times, including in eight straight years from 2009-16. A former offensive coordinator, McCarthy helped develop quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers and Dak Prescott. Rodgers won a Super Bowl MVP and two league MVPs with McCarthy. In 2023, Prescott enjoyed arguably his best season as he led the NFL with 36 touchdown passes.  Speaking of Rodgers, the 42-year-old future Hall of Famer spent the 2025 season with the Steelers and played a key role in helping Pittsburgh record its record 22nd straight non-losing season. Pittsburgh would reportedly welcome Rodgers back if he decides to come back for a 22nd season. McCarthy is a departure from the Steelers' usual hiring practices as Tomlin, Bill Cowher and Noll were all young, first-time head coaches with a defensive background. And in Tomlin, McCarthy is following some pretty big footsteps. Tomlin, who stepped down a day after Pittsburgh's loss to the Houston Texans in the AFC wild card round, won a Super Bowl and coached in another during his 19-year run in Pittsburgh. He led the Steelers to the playoffs 13 times (winning the AFC North eight times) and never had a losing season.  \n\n        \n            \n                Nine years without a Steelers playoff win and the quiet cost of never losing enough in Pittsburgh\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Steelers are coming off a third consecutive 10-7 season and their first division title since 2020. Pittsburgh also continued its nine-year drought without a playoff win following its 30-6 loss to Houston.  Pittsburgh's roster has some notable but aging players that includes 31-year-old T.J. Watt, 31-year-old Jalen Ramsey and 36-year-old Cameron Heyward. They also have some promising young talent, led by offensive linemen Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick and defensive lineman Derrick Harmon.  Quarterback remains the Steelers' biggest question mark as the team has yet to find Ben Roethlisberger's longterm successor. Once again, quarterback will be one of the Steelers' primary focuses -- if Rodgers retires or opts to play elsewhere -- as they look to once again be in contention in 2026.  \nAfter a particularly busy NFL coaching cycle where 10 jobs opened, only four vacancies remain -- the Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders.\n            ",

Following Indiana's national championship win over Miami, Cignetti placed his Hoosiers at No. 1, followed by the Hurricanes, Oregon, Ole Miss and Ohio State inside the top five.The Big Ten dominated bowl season and placed three teams in the College Football Playoff, ending with the league's third consecutive national title. The SEC is 1-5 in CFP games against non-conference competition since Georgia's 65-7 win over TCU in the national title during the final year of the four-team era.\"I think it's called paradigm shift,\" Cignetti said after Monday's win. \"It's kind of like people can cling to an old way of thinking, categorizing teams as this or that of conferences as this or that, where they can't adjust to the new world.\"\n        \n            \n                Indiana's national championship isn't a fairy tale. It's a warning for college football's old order\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCignetti ranked seven SEC teams, including six in the top 13. But notably, Cignetti placed Iowa at No. 11 ahead of Alabama, whom the Hoosiers beat, 38-3, in the CFP quarterfinals. Illinois is No. 16 on Cignetti's ballot. The Fighting Illini beat Tennessee in the Music City Bowl and lost to Indiana during the regular season, 63-10.\nMichigan and Washington are ranked No. 17 and No. 18. The Hoosiers didn't play either team this season. Michigan lost to Texas in the Citrus Bowl while Washington dominated Boise State, 38-10, in the LA Bowl.This season was the Big Ten's first three-peat since the 1940s. Indiana went unbeaten while beating six top-10 teams, strengthening its unprecedented finish.\"I would like to say our NIL is nowhere near what people think it is, so you can throw that out, and this team really overcame a lot on the road in a lot of tight games and found a way to get it done,\" Cignetti said. \"And we're 16-0, and I guess we're 27-2 since Indiana. But we're 16-0, national champions at Indiana University, which I know a lot of people thought was never possible. \n\"It probably is one of the greatest sports stories of all time.

    "description": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch",
    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. Nine NFL teams have fired their coaches and one, Mike Tomlin, has stepped down. The Titans and Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season.The Falcons fired Raheem Morris right after their season ended. On Black Monday, the Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon.A day later, the Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons.Two days after that, the Dolphins fired Mike McDaniel.After a wild card round loss, Tomlin stepped down from his post as the Steelers head coach after 19 seasons. Following a playoff loss to the Broncos in the divisional round, the Bills entered the coaching hunt after firing Sean McDermott. Five hires have since been made -- including Harbaugh and Stefanski landing new jobs -- but five vacancies remain. Let's rank them in order of desirability.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. BillsThe Bills have arguably the best player in the league at the most important position in the sport in Josh Allen. That alone makes this the most coveted job of this cycle, after the Bills fired Sean McDermott after their latest playoff loss to the Denver Broncos. Pairing yourself next to Allen has championship potential, so every head coach who hasn't already accepted a job will almost certainly stop what they're doing and see if they can align themselves with Allen. \nOutside of the elite QB, Buffalo does have other things going for it. James Cook is coming off a 2025 regular season where he led the NFL in rushing, the defense allowed a league-low 156.9 passing yards per game, and they are just about to move into a brand new stadium. That said, whoever is hired will need to help improve a horrid run defense and get the most out of a lacking pass-catching group to truly help Allen get over the hump in the postseason. \n        \n            \n                Bills coaching search: Buffalo to interview Mike McDaniel with Josh Allen 'significantly' involved in process\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.\nOne drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.\nThe Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. \nThey do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n            ",

The Rams are now headed to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2021, a season that ended with them winning the Super Bowl. In the NFC title game, the Rams will be heading to Seattle to face the Seahawks for the third time this season. The teams split their two regular-season meetings with the Rams winning in Week 11 (21-19) and the Seahawks winning in Week 16 (38-37). The Seahawks earned their way to the NFC Championship by absolutely destroying the 49ers in a 41-6 win on Saturday night. The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's NFL Championship Sunday picks: Jarrett Stidham does enough for Broncos, Seahawks lean on defense\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the AFC, the Denver Broncos are headed to the conference title game after beating the Buffalo Bills, 33-30 in overtime, in what was easily the wildest game of the divisional round. The Broncos' vaunted defense forced five turnovers, including four from Josh Allen, who threw two interceptions while also losing two fumbles. The top-seeded Broncos will now host New England in the AFC title game with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line. The Patriots advanced on Sunday after beating the Texans, 28-16. The Broncos and Patriots are facing each other in the AFC title game for the third time in 13 years. The two previous meetings were both played in Denver and the Broncos won both of them. If the Broncos are going to get to the Super Bowl this year, they're going to have to do it without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury against Buffalo. For the Patriots, it will mark their first trip to the conference title game since 2018 in what ended up being the final appearance by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Divisional Round scheduleSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC ChampionshipPatriots at Broncos, 3 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)NFC ChampionshipRams at Seahawks, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) Steelers\nTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

This Seattle defense is much better than that Bears group. But Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has had success against them in the two games.\"The Seattle defense is the best unit of any left in the playoffs, which will challenge McVay to come up with new ways to move the football. The Rams lack great outside speed, and that showed up last week at Chicago. Keep an eye on that in this one. \"On the other side, the Rams defense has had some leakage issues in the secondary over the past six weeks. It is not a great group. The good news is Seattle wants to run it more than throw it.\n\"Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold is the key. If he can take care of the football, which he didn't do in a playoff loss to the Rams last year when he was with the Vikings, the Seahawks will win the game. I think he does. The Seattle defense is playing too good right now. That defensive front will disrupt the night for Stafford as the Seahawks get to the Super Bowl behind that defense.\" Pick: Seahawks 23, Rams 17To see Prisco's AFC Championship pick, click here.SportsLine's Larry Hartstein's Rams vs. Seahawks pickThere is no better resource when it comes to betting on Rams games than Hartstein. He's nailed 28 of his last 38 picks in games involving Los Angeles, and Harstein is now putting this NFC Championship in the crosshairs. We can tell you Hartstein is leaning Over the 47.5 total. To see his official pick for this game, however, you'll need to log on to SportsLine. Tyler Sullivan's Rams vs. Seahawks pickSeahawks -2.5: \"The Seahawks were the best defense in the NFL this season, allowing the fewest points per game (17.2), the lowest third-down conversion rate (32.05%), and the second fewest yards per play (4.6). They also haven't allowed a touchdown over their last two games, dating to the regular season.\n\"Matthew Stafford did have success against this defense earlier this year, but the veteran quarterback was a bit shaky at times last week against a Chicago defense that isn't in the same stratosphere as Seattle's. Stafford dealt with a solid amount of pressure and was sacked four times on the night. There was also a period against the Bears where he and the Rams punted six times over a seven-drive stretch. Chicago simply didn't take advantage. Seattle can, and will, especially if Kenneth Walker III gets rolling on the ground.\" Pick: Seahawks 30, Rams 20To see Sullivan's AFC Championship pick, click here.John Breech's Rams vs. Seahawks pickRams +2.5: \"The Seahawks only lost three games all year and all three of those games had one big thing in common: They turned the ball over multiple times. The Seahawks are so good that they only tend to lose when they beat themselves: They went 9-0 this season when their turnover number was one or zero, but they went 6-3  when they turned the ball over two times or more. \"The problem for the Seahawks is that if there's anyone who might turn the ball over multiple times in a big game, it's definitely Sam Darnold, especially if that game is against the Rams. In two games against L.A. this season, Darnold has been picked off six times. \n\"Darnold had the most turnovers by any player in the NFL this year with 20 (14 interceptions, six lost fumbles). Since 1990, only one QB has led the NFL in turnovers and won the Super Bowl in the same year, and that was Eli Manning, who did it thanks to a miracle run by the Giants in 2007. \"Darnold has faced the Rams four times since the beginning of last season and here's what has happened: He's been sacked 16 times, he's thrown seven interceptions and he's gone 1-3.\" Pick: Rams 30, Seahawks 23To see Breech's AFC Championship pick, click here.Mike McClure's top DFS for Championship SundayIf you want to add some DFS lineups to your Championship Sunday, Mike McClure is the expert you'll want to follow.

L.A. won the first game between these two teams and should have won the second one, and would have if not for one of the craziest two-point conversions anyone has ever seen. The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position. In this case, that's Matthew Stafford and the Rams. I like them to advance with a closely-contested win.\" Pick: Rams 23, Seahawks 20To see Dubin's AFC Championship pick, click here.Jordan Dajani's Rams vs. Seahawks pickRams +2.5: \"My preseason Super Bowl pick was Ravens vs. Rams, and just because I was wrong about Baltimore does not mean I'm flaking on Los Angeles in this spot. Everyone is going to be on the Seahawks this week because of their incredible defense, but I will remind you that Matthew Stafford and Co. racked up 581 yards of total offense and 37 points in that overtime thriller in Seattle we witnessed last month. This pick comes down to me trusting Stafford and his fantastic cast of weapons more than Sam Darnold. The historical trends are in my favor as well. The Rams are 2-0 all-time vs. the Seahawks in the playoffs, and have won four straight NFC Championship game appearances.\"I know scoring points against this Seahawks defense will be tough. The only touchdowns they've allowed since Thanksgiving, not including the Rams matchup, are a Philip Rivers passing touchdown and a Bryce Young rushing touchdown. Still, I'm calling for the upset. Sean McVay is 5-2 against the spread and 4-3 straight up as an underdog in the playoffs.\" Pick: Rams 24, Seahawks 23\nTo see Dajani's AFC Championship pick, click here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's time to kick off a new era for UFC. The promotion begins with Paramount+ on Saturday night in Las Vegas with UFC 324 at the T-Mobile Arena. The main event sees an interim lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Follow live updates on UFC 324: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett as event debuts on Paramount+\"I'm happy I'm the underdog and I'm happy to be fighting someone so confident with so much momentum behind them because one thing you must understand in this game is, I don't care how confident you are, you better be perfect,\" Gaethje said. \"And he's going to make mistakes and I'm going to take advantage of his mistakes. I've said it before but I don't plan on being alive after Saturday night. I have to tell myself that he's going to kill me so that I can go into my most primal place.\n\"I love the pressure, I love the moments and I love the adrenaline -- it's the best drug in the world.\" Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Pimblett, meanwhile, is a man on the rise as he looks to get his first piece of UFC gold. The Brit is undefeated in seven trips to the Octagon, including an impressive TKO of Michael Chandler last April. Gaethje represents by far the biggest test of Pimblett's young career.\nThe card also features some former champions and rising contenders looking to make a splash. That begins in the main card opener when Jean Silva takes on Arnold Allen at featherweight. Silva is coming off a tough loss to Diego Lopes but remains a dangerous out for anyone in the 145-pound division. Plus, former women's strawweight champion Rose Namajunas takes on a difficult test in the fast rising contender Natalia Silva. Big boys also support the main card when heavyweights Waldo Cortes-Acosta and Derrick Lewis collide. And former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley looks to get back on track when he faces the hard-hitting Song Yadong in the co-main event.Saturday marks the first time in four years that a numbered event will air live without being on PPV in the United States.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 AFC Championship Game will welcome back some conference powers who have been away for several years as the top-seeded Denver Broncos host the New England Patriots on Sunday. These franchises rank in the top three of all-time AFC title game appearances, but this is just the second NFL playoff appearance for Denver since its 2015 Super Bowl run. The Patriots, meanwhile, have rapidly rebuilt under first-year coach and franchise legend Mike Vrabel, and they are set to return to the AFC title game for the first time since 2018. Jarrett Stidham will start at quarterback for Denver after Bo Nix broke his ankle in the divisional round. Kickoff from Empower Field at Mile High is set for 3 p.m. ET. New England is a 4.5-point road favorite in the latest Patriots vs. Broncos odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under is 43.5. Before making any Broncos vs. Patriots picks, be sure to check out the NFL playoff predictions from SportsLine's Bruce Marshall.Watch the game on CBS and Paramount+, where plans start at just $8.99/month. Sign up here.For years Vegas-based Bruce Marshall was synonymous with The Gold Sheet, the famed sports betting newsletter. With a background in play-by-play work and sports information while in college, Bruce joined TGS in 1981 when hired by the legendary Mort Olshan and served as executive editor for many years. Marshall has crushed his NFL picks, going 58-38-2 (+1494) in his last 98 NFL against the spread picks. Anybody following his NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.    Now, Marshall has set his sights on Broncos vs. Patriots. You can visit SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the NFL odds and trends for Patriots vs. Broncos:\nBroncos vs. Patriots spreadPatriots -4.5 at DraftKings SportsbokBroncos vs. Patriots over/under43.5 pointsBroncos vs. Patriots money line Patriots -218, Bears +180Broncos vs. Patriots picksSee picks at SportsLineBroncos vs. Patriots streaming Paramount+Why the Patriots can coverNew England has a golden opportunity to advance to the Super Bowl thanks in large part to Nix's injury. The hypothetical lookahead lines for this game had Denver listed as a small favorite, so Nix's injury certainly changed the outlook in a major way. The Patriots have handled the Chargers and Texans without too much difficulty, defeating both by double digits. The Pats have also been beating market expectations all season as they led the NFL with a 13-5-1 record against the spread, and they were 7-1 ATS on the road. Denver, meanwhile, went just 8-10 ATS this season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverStidham is a competent backup who started multiple games for Sean Payton in 2023, so the drop off might not be as large as the odds shift is indicating. Denver can also lean on a stout defense that ranked second in the NFL in total defense and third in scoring defense this season. Denver's overall spread numbers aren't as strong as New England's, but the Broncos were 5-1 ATS as an underdog and 3-0 ATS as a home underdog, and now they're getting more than a field goal in one of the league's toughest places to play. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Broncos vs. Patriots picksMarshall is going Over on the total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the spread.

    "body": "\n        Mohamed Toure's college football journey isn't ending anytime soon. The standout Miami linebacker is planning to return for the 2026 season, giving him a rare eighth year of eligibility, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and 247Sports' Gaby Urrutia. The decision follows the Hurricanes' run to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game and keeps one of their most productive defenders around for another year.Toure's return is technically legitimate under NCAA rules. He redshirted as a true freshman at Rutgers in 2019. Then, in 2020, the NCAA granted all players a free year of eligibility because of the pandemic-shortened season. On top of that, Toure lost two full seasons to ACL injuries while at Rutgers -- in 2022 and again in 2024 -- both of which resulted in medical redshirts.Stacked together, those technicalities created an unusual path: a traditional redshirt, a COVID waiver and two medical redshirts. The result is an eighth season of college football for a player who first arrived on campus at Rutgers in January 2019 as a three-star recruit.\n        \n            \n                Miami's magical run came up short, but Hurricanes belonged on college football's biggest stage\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nToure transferred to Miami in 2025 and immediately became a core piece of the defense. He led the Hurricanes with 84 tackles, including three for loss, two sacks and six pass breakups, while starting all 16 games. Miami leaned heavily on his experience throughout its playoff run, where he consistently showed up in high-pressure moments.\nIn the CFP, Toure recorded eight tackles against Texas A&M, seven against Ohio State in the quarterfinals, four in the semifinals against Ole Miss and matched a career-high with 11 tackles in the national title game loss to Indiana. One of the defining plays of Miami's postseason came in the opening round, when he broke up a late pass at the goal line against Texas A&M to help preserve a Hurricanes win.Toure's return matters for a defense facing turnover. With Wesley Bissainthe declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft, Miami loses a multi-year contributor in the middle of its linebacker room. Toure's presence gives the unit an experienced anchor as younger players are pushed into larger roles.The decision also reflects the modern structure of college football. With NIL opportunities and revenue sharing now part of the landscape, staying in school has become a realistic option for players with remaining eligibility who aren't projected early-round NFL picks. For veterans like Toure, another year can offer both financial stability and a chance to improve draft positioning.\nEight seasons in college football isn't normal. It's not supposed to happen. But in Toure's case, the rules allow it -- and Miami is set to benefit from it.\n            ",

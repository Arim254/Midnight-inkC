    "body": "\n        NFC teams coming off different results on Thanksgiving Day will meet on 'Thursday Night Football' as the Dallas Cowboys visit the Detroit Lions. Dallas (6-5-1) defeated Kansas City on Thanksgiving, 31-28, for its third straight victory. Detroit (7-5) fell to Green Bay on the holiday, 31-24, as the Lions have alternated wins and losses over their last eight games. However, the Lions won the last meeting between the teams, 47-9 in 2024, which is Dallas' largest margin of defeat since 1988. CB Trevon Diggs (knee), OL Tyler Guyton (ankle) and Jadeveon Clowney (hamstring) have been ruled for for Dallas, while Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) is active for Detroit.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Ford Field in Detroit. The Lions' victory in their 2024 matchup ended a six-game win streak by Dallas in the head-to-head series. Detroit is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Lions vs. Cowboys odds. Meanwhile, the over/under for total points is 55.5. Detroit is at -181 on the money line (risk $181 to win $100). Before making any Cowboys vs. Lions picks, make sure to check out the 'Thursday Night Football' predictions from SportsLine NFL expert R.J.

Meanwhile, Detroit has lost three straight versus the spread, and it lost one of its best playmakers in Sam LaPorta (back). While Detroit still has its backfield of Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery to lean on, the run defense has been the biggest improvement for Dallas recently. Since acquiring Quinnen Williams from the Jets, Dallas has allowed just 69.7 rushing yards, which is less than half of the 143 yards per game it allowed in nine games prior to his arrival. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Lions can coverThese teams met in October 2024 -- in Dallas -- in which the Lions' 38-point victory was their third-largest road win, ever, while the game also marked Dallas' fourth-largest home loss in franchise history. So, Detroit should feel very confident it can take care of business at home, as the Cowboys average 6.9 fewer points on the road than in Dallas. Dan Campbell also knows how to get the best out of his team after a defeat, as the Lions have remarkable resiliency in terms of spread success. Since the start of the 2023 season, the Lions are 10-1 ATS (90.9%) following a straight-up defeat, while Dallas is just 11-13 ATS (45.8%) after a win over that same time frame. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest BetMGM bonus code to get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:How to make Cowboys vs. Lions  picksWhite has analyzed Lions vs. Cowboys from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

    "body": "\n        From one glance at the Championship Week college football odds, there is a clear outlier amongst the Power 4 title games. That's over in the Big 12, which has Texas Tech favored by 12.5 points over BYU, per the latest Championship Week college football lines. Meanwhile, the other power conference championship games all have college football spreads of under 6 points. They include Georgia vs. Alabama (+2.5) in the SEC, Ohio State vs. Indiana (+4) in the Big Ten and Virginia vs. Duke (+4.5) in the ACC.Whether you prefer to make Championship Week college football bets on smaller lines or larger college football spreads is a matter of preference. However, having the proper college football betting advice will set you up for success during the conference championship schedule.

No team has a better point differential than IU (+401), which is 50 points greater than what Ohio State has. Indiana also has the Heisman favorite in Fernando Mendoza, who leads FBS with 32 passing touchdowns, while topping the Big Ten in total touchdowns and yards per attempt. His counterpart, Julian Sayin, has thrown picks in his last two games away from home, and the Buckeyes haven't won the turnover battle in five straight games. In addition to the Hoosiers sticking within the spread, the model also says the Over hits over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Duke (+4.5, 57.5) covers versus No. 16 Virginia in the ACC Championship Game on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET. The model projects the Blue Devils to cover almost 60% of the time. While UVA prevailed when these teams met on Nov. 8, the Cavs' offense is limping into this rematch. UVA averaged 36.4 points over its first nine games but is averaging over 13 fewer points over its last three. Meanwhile, Duke is coming off a season-high of 49 points in a victory over 8-win Wake Forest, as the Blue Devils have one of the most efficient offenses around. They rank 19th in the nation, and second in the ACC, with 34.6 ppg, and only two teams in all of FBS have thrown fewer interceptions. Virginia has as many turnovers (five) over its last three games as Duke has over its last nine games, and the turnover margin is one reason why Duke sticks within the spread. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Championship WeekThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every Championship Week matchup, and it's calling for three underdogs to outright win. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which three teams should you jump on?

    "body": "\n        A baby born on the last day that LeBron James scored single-digit points in a regular season NBA game would be an adult today. It has been nearly 19 years since James was last held below 10 points in the regular season, the last such occasion coming on Jan. 5, 2007. That's a stretch of 1,297 total games. But when the final buzzer sounded between the Los Angeles Lakers and Toronto Raptors on Thursday, James had only eight points. The mythical streak had finally, amazingly, come to an end.And it ended in the most LeBron James-possible fashion. With the score tied at 120 and the final seconds ticking down, Austin Reaves, who finished the game with 44 points, tried to create an opening for a game-winner. When Scottie Barnes crept over to double Reaves, he passed it to a wide open James, who bolted into the lane. A frantic Immanuel Quickley rotated over from the corner to pick him up, which left Rui Hachimura wide open. James did what he's been doing for even longer than he's been scoring double-digit points in regular-season games: he made the right basketball play. He passed the ball to Hachimura, who drilled the game-winning 3-pointer, leaving James, who could have attempted his own game-winner to reach 10 points, stranded at eight as time expired.\n\"This is the best way. If it had to end, the perfect ending for the streak is tonight,\" James told The Athletic after the game. \"It's literally who I am. That's who I am. ... It's always been about: 'How can I win the game? How can I make the right play and win the game?' That streak just happened.\"Throughout his career, James has drawn criticism for making passes just like this. In Game 1 of the 2007 Eastern Conference finals, he made a similar pass to Donyell Marshall in the final seconds, but he missed the possible game-winning 3-pointer and the Cavaliers lost by two. In Game 5 of the 2020 NBA Finals, James could have won the championship with his own final shot. He passed the ball to Danny Green instead, who also missed. His critics, many of whom love to point out how eager players like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant are to take game-ending shots, yelled that as the star, he should have been responsible for scoring those final, critical points.But James has never been wired like Jordan or Bryant. He always makes the right basketball play, even if that play means giving the ball to someone else. It can come in the first quarter of a random game. It can come with the title on the line. It can even cost him one of his most legendary streaks. But James is always going to make the play he believes gives his team the best chance to win. He did that on Thursday, and it paid off for the Lakers. James never doubted the process. \n\"You always make the right play,\" James explained after the game. \"That's just been my M.O. That's how I was taught the game. I've done that my whole career. There's not even one second guessing that. Once they doubled AR and the ball got swung to me, I know it's a numbers game. We've got a 4-on-3 advantage. I was just trying to put the ball on time, on target in Rui's socket, in his shot pocket, and he knocked it down.\"That attitude is going to serve the Lakers well this season. James is now 41 years old. Through his first five games this season, he was already averaging a career-low 15.2 points per game. James has tended to start seasons slowly as a Laker, but there's a pretty noticeable difference this season as he's worked his way back from sciatica. The player who is used to controlling every aspect of his team's offense is clearly struggling to get up to speed. James already had one streak scare on Monday against the Phoenix Suns. He finished the loss with exactly 10 points, and he needed 31 minutes to get them.But the Lakers don't need James scoring at the volume that he typically has. Reaves and Luka Dončić entered Thursday's game averaging a combined 63.4 points per game, the most ever by a post-merger pair of teammates. The Lakers have more than enough scoring.\nWhat they need is for James to fit in. To play hard on defense, get rebounds and make the smart pass. He did all of that on Thursday. Case in point: he may not have reached double digit points, but he got to 11 assists in a victory. That has always been his preference, and it's what's going to make him a valuable player even as age leads to inevitable decline. James isn't as fast as he used to be. He may not be able to jump as high or play quite as hard on a possession-by-possession basis. But he's a pathologically unselfish basketball genius, and that's the sort of player that every team could benefit from. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Dallas Cowboys are looking to extend their win streak to four games in Week 14, but they will have to finish out this Thursday night showdown with the Detroit Lions without one of their star wideouts. In the third quarter, CeeDee Lamb was injured while attempting to catch a touchdown. He hit his head on the turf, and the Cowboys' medical staff quickly ruled him out with a concussion, per the Amazon broadcast.Check out what happened, here:\nLamb was in the midst of another massive performance, as he caught six passes for 123 yards before exiting the contest. The four-time Pro Bowl receiver had caught 51 passes for 744 yards and three touchdowns in nine games played entering this week.This unfortunate development opens the door for George Pickens, who entered this week ranked No. 2 in receiving yards with 1,142. The former Pittsburgh Steeler and Lamb are the only duo in Cowboys history to average 80 receiving yards per game in a season. Naturally, Detroit's defense turned its focus to Pickens when Lamb exited, which gave Ryan Flournoy some opportunities to make plays. In the fourth quarter, he caught a 42-yard touchdown pass to pull Dallas within three points. \nIf there's a silver lining with the Lamb injury, it's that he's going to have more time to heal with Dallas on a mini bye. Up next for the Cowboys are the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 14. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles once again are facing adversity as they have lost back-to-back games for the second time this season. The Los Angeles Chargers have won four of their last five contests but are dealing with a problem of their own as quarterback Justin Herbert is dealing with a hand injury.Philadelphia and Los Angeles attempt to overcome their issues when they square off in Week 14 of the 2025 NFL season at SoFi Stadium on Monday Night Football.Philadelphia (8-4) bounced back from consecutive losses to the Denver Broncos and New York Giants in early October with four straight victories, but the Eagles squandered a 21-point lead against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 12 and dropped a 24-21 decision before being embarrassed at home by the Chicago Bears 24-15 last week.Despite its current struggles, Philadelphia owns a 1 1/2-game lead over Dallas in the NFC East. But the club will need to get untracked offensively if it hopes to avoid another defeat as it has recorded only two touchdowns since early in the second quarter against the Cowboys.\nBoth of those TDs came on passes from Jalen Hurts to A.J. Brown, who have accounted for all six of the Eagles' touchdowns over their last three games. Hurts has run for three scores, giving him a team-high eight rushing TDs, and connected with Brown for the other three.Saquon Barkley, who led the NFL in rushing last season with 2,005 yards, is just 16th in the league this year with 740. The 28-year-old has run for only four touchdowns and has gone four straight games without making his way into the end zone.The Chargers (8-4) had their three-game winning streak halted in Week 11 with a dismal 35-6 setback against the Jacksonville Jaguars but returned from their bye to cruise past the Las Vegas Raiders 31-14 last week. However, Herbert fractured his non-throwing hand in that victory and underwent surgery, leaving his status for Monday night in question.Considering that Trey Lance is its backup, Los Angeles will need Herbert on the field if it hopes to hand Philadelphia its third consecutive loss. The 27-year-old has been one of the league's top signal-callers this campaign, ranking eighth with 2,842 passing yards and sixth with 21 touchdown tosses -- two fewer than his 2024 total.Whomever starts at quarterback for the Chargers won't have to contend with Jalen Carter, as the Eagles' defensive tackle will miss the contest after undergoing procedures on both of his shoulders this past Monday. The 24-year-old has been dealing with shoulder issues all season and registered just his second sack in last week's defeat.Even with Carter on the field, Philadelphia is just 25th in the NFL in total defense this year with an average of 347.2 yards allowed. Conversely, Los Angeles ranks third in total defense (275.3 yards allowed), second against the pass (168.3) and sixth in sacks (34).The Chargers enter Week 14 second in the AFC West, two games behind division-leading Denver (10-2). They occupy the first wild card spot in the conference but are just one game better than the Houston Texans (7-5), who are eighth in the playoff standings.Therefore, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes a loss to the Eagles would be a major blow to Los Angeles' postseason hopes. But according to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, a setback by the Eagles would not be very harmful to either their playoff or division title chances. CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 14 WINWITH WEEK 14 LOSSDIFFERENCELos Angeles Chargers63.6%76.7%50.3%26.4%Philadelphia Eagles90.1%96.4%84.0%12.4%CHANCES OF WINNING NFC EASTCURRENTWITH WEEK 14 WINWITH WEEK 14 LOSSDIFFERENCEPhiladelphia Eagles86.5%94.0%79.3%14.7%Even though the Chargers defeated the Broncos in their first meeting this season, the model doesn't give them much of a chance to overtake Denver -- which visits 2-10 Las Vegas on Sunday -- and win their first AFC West title since 2009. It says Los Angeles' prospects for the division crown currently are less than 10% and would drop below 5% with a loss to Philadelphia.CHANCES OF WINNING AFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 14 WINWITH WEEK 14 LOSSDIFFERENCELos Angeles Chargers9.5%14.4%4.5%9.9%Denver Broncos89.3%92.8%78.5%14.3%The Eagles are 8-5 against the Chargers in the all-time series but have lost three of the last four meetings, including a 27-24 setback in Week 9 of the 2021 season. Herbert was the offensive star for Los Angeles in that triumph, throwing for two touchdowns and running for another, while Hurts connected with DeVonta Smith for one of Philadelphia's scores.Philadelphia is a 2.5-point favorite against Los Angeles in the latest consensus odds, but the ITL team's model is projecting a 22-21 victory for the Chargers, which would move them one step closer to their third postseason appearance in four years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After whiffing on numerous candidates, Penn State has turned the focus of its long, winding coaching search to a prominent name in the Big 12. The Nittany Lions are now targeting Iowa State's Matt Campbell, sources confirmed to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. The two sides had talks on Thursday. Campbell has achieved unprecedented success, posting a 72-55 record throughout a decade-long tenure at Iowa State and has been tied to various coaching searches across the Big Ten on numerous occasions. Each time his name popped up as a candidate for a premier job, though, Campbell elected to remain with the Cyclones. Prior to his stint at Iowa State, Campbell made a name for himself as a head coach by going 35-15 across five seasons leading Toledo in the MAC. While it has taken a while for Campbell to emerge as a Penn State target, his track record of maximizing his program's potential indicates he could thrive with the Nittany Lions. Campbell inherited a perennial middling operation when he took the Iowa State job in 2016, and he quickly turned his program into one of the Big 12's most consistent winners. After a three-win debut, the Cyclones posted just one losing season from 2017 onward. They racked up five consecutive bowl appearances for the first time in school history and reached their first conference championship game in an 11-win 2024 campaign.\n        \n            \n                Kalani Sitake sends Penn State coaching search back to drawing board again as eight targets spurn interest\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nShould Penn State close the deal with Campbell, it would bring a splendid conclusion to a coaching search that turned sour as candidate after candidate brushed off interest in the Penn State job. Eight presumptive candidates locked up contract extensions or engaged in such conversations with their current schools instead of taking the position. On Thursday, Alabama's Kalen DeBoer became the latest to deny ties to the Nittany Lions.\nThis prolonged search has had major ramifications on the program's immediate outlook. Penn State inked just two recruits on Signing Day after losing countless commits, many of whom followed Franklin to Virginia Tech. Reconstructing the recruiting class and attacking the transfer portal when it opens Jan. 2 would be among Campbell's most pressing tasks upon his arrival.Could Campbell deliver Penn State's elusive next step?For all of the much-deserved praise Franklin received for rebuilding Penn State into a Big Ten title contender, the frustration of consistently falling short of championships did not sit well with the Nittany Lions faithful. The program remains in search of its first national championship since 1986, and it achieved Big Ten supremacy just once in Franklin's 12 years at the helm.For a potential Campbell tenure to be considered a success, not only would Penn State need to consistently advance deep into the College Football Playoff and win the occasional conference crown, but it would also need to fare better against premier competition than it did over the last decade. The Nittany Lions went just 4-21 against AP top-10 teams under Franklin's watch and just 2-21 against teams in the top six.\nThe floor is incredibly high at Penn State. Campbell would be tasked with raising the ceiling. Anything less than a breakthrough would make the Franklin firing appear as a waste of a coaching change.Campbell does more with lessOne sign of a prolific coach is the consistent exceeding of expectations. By that measure, Campbell is a star in the industry. Iowa State had not cracked the AP Top 25 in a decade when Campbell arrived, and he led the Cyclones to rankings in all but three of his seasons -- three times reaching the top 10. The program also only had 12 bowl appearances in its history prior to his tenure, and he made seven postseason trips.Not only has Campbell overseen the greatest period of Iowa State football to date, but he also did so with a modest amount of talent. Never in his tenure did the Cyclones secure a recruiting class better than No. 39 in the 247Sports team rankings, and more often than not, the program signed classes ranked near the bottom of the Power Four. Campbell's player development acumen and in-game abilities helped him overcome the talent gap.\nOf course, the expectation at Penn State is to recruit at a high level, so Campbell would have to prove more capable of attracting blue-chip prospects to the program than he has been at Iowa State.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas State officially hired legendary former quarterback Collin Klein as coach, the program announced Thursday. Klein, 36, had most recently served as Texas A&M's offensive coordinator. He succeeds Chris Klieman, who retired Wednesday, and 247Sports had reported Klein was in line to be the next head man in charge for the Wildcats.Klein will continue to coach the Aggies through the College Football Playoff.After redshirting at Kansas State in 2008, Klein played wide receiver in 2009 before converting to quarterback in 2010. He took over full-time behind center the next year, and across 2011 and 2012, he accumulated a 21-5 record, threw for 29 touchdowns, ran for 50 touchdowns and finished third in 2012 Heisman Trophy voting. The Wildcats reached as high as No. 2 in his senior season, tied for their highest ranking ever.Klein returned to Kansas State as a coach in 2014 and slowly worked his way up from low-level assistant to quarterbacks coach to co-offensive coordinator to, finally, offensive coordinator from 2022-23. Texas A&M hired him away after the 2023 season. Now, however, he returns to the place that made him a star.Klein's contract is for five years, with an average base salary of $4.3 million.Klieman, who took over for the iconic Bill Snyder in 2019 and was under contract through 2032, produced several strong seasons upon his arrival in Manhattan, including a 10-win campaign in 2022 and bowl wins in 2021, 2023 and 2024.But the Wildcats are just 6-6 this season after being ranked 17th in the AP preseason poll. They'll hope Klein -- the first Kansas State alum to be head coach since Ellis Rainsberger from 1975-77 -- can get things back on track.\nHere's more analysis from CBS Sports' Cody Nagel:He spent five seasons on Klieman's staff, including two as offensive coordinator, before departing for College Station ahead of the 2024 season. Klein's familiarity with Kansas State's roster, donors and recruiting base -- combined with his status as one of the program's most accomplished former players -- has made him the university's leading target as succession planning accelerates.As a coach, Klein quickly made his mark when he joined the staff in 2017. He served as Kansas State's offensive coordinator for two seasons in 2022-23, taking a unit that ranked outside the top 75 nationally in 2021 to top-25 rankings in multiple offensive categories before his departure. His offenses became known for efficiency and balance: total offense jumped from 362.3 yards per game in 2021 to 446.1 in 2023, scoring jumped from 27.5 to 37.8 points per game, and his final unit led the nation in red-zone touchdown conversion rate at 78.7%. The Wildcats' rushing attack also flourished, producing top-15 units nationally in yards per game, while quarterbacks posted school-record low interception percentages.After joining Texas A&M in 2024, Klein helped guide the Aggies to a 5-0 start in SEC play, marking the program's best conference start since 1998. The offense ranked second in the SEC in rushing behind a strong offensive line. Texas A&M ranks 16th nationally in scoring offense with 36.3 points per game this season. Klein is a semifinalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the top assistant coach in college football.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 World Cup draw is taking place on Friday, December 5th at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C. at 12 p.m. ET. Without a doubt, this is going to be one of the most important moments in the buildup to the much-anticipated summer tournament that taking place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which kicks off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, before coming to a close on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City. For the United States, it is the first time they've hosted a World Cup since 1994 (although the U.S. did host the Club World Cup last summer). The draw will be when not only the United States men's national team, but Mexico and Canada as well, will find out their fates.Friday's draw is the first for a 48-team World Cup, after the tournament was expanded from a 32 team version, and will define the path to the final for all the teams involved. Notably, while 42 nations have already clinched a spot next summer, six more are still competing in the UEFA playoffs and intercontinental playoffs, but whichever countries prevail will know their path. Those playoffs are taking place in March 2026. Let's now take a look at all you need to know ahead of Friday's draw: When is the draw taking place? The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will finally reveal the group-stage paths for the 42 teams already secured, including the three co-hosts (Canada, Mexico, and the United States), and the six contenders for the final spots in the inter-confederation and European playoffs set for late March 2026. How to watch FIFA World Cup 2026 drawDate: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts -- Washington, D.C.TV: Fox | Live stream: Fubo (try for free)Live reaction: CBS Sports Golazo Network Matchday\nHow does the draw work? Canada, Mexico and the United States, as the host countries, will be assigned to positions A1 for Mexico (green ball), B1 for Canada (red ball) and D1 for the USA (blue ball), as already established per the match schedule released in 2024. The remaining nine top-ranked teams in pot 1 will be identified by nine balls of the same color and automatically allocated to position one of the group into which they are drawn.To ensure competitive balance, two separate pathways to the semifinals have been established when developing the match schedule. In order to have a balanced distribution of the teams, the four highest-ranked teams in the FIFA Men's Rankings, when drawn, will have the following constraints: the highest-ranked team (Spain) and the second highest-ranked team (Argentina) will be randomly drawn into opposite pathways, and the same principle will apply to the third (France) and fourth (England) highest-ranked teams. This will ensure that, should they win their groups, the two highest-ranked teams will not meet before the final.No group will have more than one team from the same federation in it, except UEFA, which is required to have two groups of two UEFA teams in it, due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament. Then there's the challenge of the inter-confederation playoffs, which will not be held until after the draw. For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions will be applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams.\nWill Donald Trump be at the FIFA World Cup draw?FIFA has confirmed a number of famous athletes will be part of the festivities including Eli Manning, Aaron Judge, Tom Brady and Shaquille O'Neal.

    "body": "\n        The noise in Pittsburgh is growing louder. The proud Steelers have lost two straight heading into the first of two (likely) playoff-deciding games against the Ravens. After a 4-1 start, Pittsburgh is 6-6 and another collapse may be just around the corner.At the center of it all is head coach Mike Tomlin. Widely considered one of the best leaders in the NFL, Tomlin has been with his team longer than any other active head coach. But for all the \"never had a non-losing season\" talk, it's been eight years since the Steelers won a playoff game. And no one in Pittsburgh cares about the non-losing season record if it doesn't come with some January success.Externally, many feel like the seat has to be hot on Tomlin. But sources say that is not the case internally.\"He doesn't pay attention to it. It's been this way since he got [to Pittsburgh,]\" said a source. \"... He remains focused on winning and doesn't let the noise affect him.\"\nTomlin, 53, signed a three-year contract extension last year that keeps him with the Steelers through the 2027 season. He has been at the helm since 2007. A Steelers head coach hasn't been fired since 1941, and all indications are it won't be happening at the end of this season either.As it stands today, there's a good likelihood Tomlin is back coaching the Steelers in 2026. But in the event he's not, league sources see two different options.The Steelers could trade Tomlin to another team, collecting what is sure to be a first-round pick for his services. But Pittsburgh would need Tomlin's blessing as he possesses a no-trade clause, so it would have to be a collective decision among three parties: the Steelers, Tomlin and his next team.\nThe other option would be a mutual parting of ways, and not the \"mutual parting of ways\" that saw New England fire Bill Belichick after the 2023 season. But as one source put it, if the Steelers decide a fresh start is needed, \"who are they going to hire that will be better?\"There is also recent proof-of-concept with a coaching gap year. Sean Payton had a year off before going to Denver, where the Broncos are set to make the playoffs again. Mike Vrabel didn't land a job after getting canned in Tennessee and now may get a first-round bye in New England. Mike McCarthy spent his year in a garage after Green Bay and then went to the playoffs three times in five years in Dallas. (Now, in the interest of fairness, the year off has not been particularly kind to Pete Carroll in Las Vegas). Here is what is not going to happen: Tomlin is not going to leave to the NFL to go coach in college, and he's not going to be the next head coach of Penn State football like his former quarterback floated this week.\n\"Maybe a fresh start for him is what's best,\" Roethlisberger said on his podcast. \"Whether that's in the pros, maybe go be Penn State's head coach. You know what he would do in Penn State? He would probably go win national championships, because he's a great recruiter.\"Penn State, the first open job in major college football, somehow remains open today after being rejected by a roster of coaches. CBS Sports' college football reports think the Nittany Lions' next target is Matt Campbell of Iowa State. Roethlisberger may not have intended to come off as disrespectful, but it's hard to interpret such a suggestion as anything other than that.\nTomlin makes more money in the NFL than he ever would in college. If available, he would be one of the most sought-after coaches in all of pro football. He hasn't coached in college in a quarter century and just a few years ago shot down any notion of ever going to that level.Not to mention, Tomlin is a first-option type of coach. \"Ben is more concerned about remaining relevant than being real and respectful,\" said one source.Yes, things are loud in the Steel City. And Tomlin must shoulder his share of blame should this season go the way last year did. But if I had to rank the NFL head coaches by who cares the least about what's being said externally, Mike Tomlin is at least tied for the top spot. \nWhy embattled Giants GM Schoen may keep his jobThere are some press conferences you can win. In most instances, the opportunity to lose a press conference is available. And sometimes, there is no way you can win it, so you just mitigate the damage.That's what I saw this week when embattled Giants GM Joe Schoen spoke at his scheduled bye week presser. His team has won five games the past two seasons. He's the architect of the team. The head coach and defensive coordinator have been voted off the island. There was no chance Schoen could win the presser.Schoen's seat has been hot for a year. It was hot when John Mara decided to keep Brian Daboll and Schoen together at the end of last season. It remained hot when Mara fired Daboll last month and said Schoen would stay on. It is still hot as the losses pile up.\nCould Mara change his mind at the end of the season and fire Schoen? Of course he could. Joe Judge wasn't fired until he talked his way out of the job, opting to lose the press conference after that Bears game toward the end of the 2021 season.But sources say the sense is nothing has yet changed. Naturally, some more competitive games down the stretch would help everyone's case there (home vs. the Commanders, Vikings and Cowboys, plus a road trip to Las Vegas, remain). \n        \n            \n                Giants' Abdul Carter explains why he's 'glad' he's going through multiple benchings\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere's also the notion that Schoen could lose his job only if Mara's top head-coach candidate says he will only take the job if Schoen isn't there. We saw a version of that play out last year in Jacksonville when Shad Khan couldn't secure anyone's services while Trent Baalke remained as GM. But sources across the league have spoken highly of Schoen and how great he is to work with.\nThe Giants head coaching job could be the best on the market this cycle, highlighted by the presence of quarterback Jaxson Dart. I don't get the sense coaching candidates will balk, if you will, at working with Schoen. Plus, he's only under contract through the 2026 season. So if it doesn't work, that coach will likely be part of the group choosing the next GM anyway.Houston's found solutionsStroud threw for 276 yards and completed 63% of his passes in last week's return.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            I spent some time in this space two weeks ago applauding the work Houston has done offensively recently, and I think there's more to it. The Texans got a big AFC South win against the Colts last week in C.J. Stroud's return, and it showed to some observers that things are clicking again for the quarterback.\"Sometimes the best thing you can do to win a game is take a completion, throw the ball away, affect the game with great run checks, and understand field position and when's the best time and place to scramble,\" said one AFC offensive coach. \"And when he's got to put on the cape and be special, those opportunities will present out of necessity.\"\nThe Texans have won four straight, including three wins with backup QB Davis Mills, and the offense has even left some points in the field in the past two wins against the Bills and Colts. It shows an offense that took some time to gel with a first-time play-caller in Nick Caley and a personnel group that needed better play along the offensive line.Through the first nine weeks of the season, the Texans ranked 26th in the league in offensive expected points added (EPA). Since then, Houston is ranked 15th in the league, just behind the Chicago Bears.Sunday night's game against the Chiefs will be a great challenge for Houston. The Chiefs defense will test Stroud's discipline with the multiple looks K.C. DC Steve Spagnuolo presents.\nPrepare for earlier-than-usual contract negotiationsA plugged-in league source told me this week to keep an eye on teams doing more end-of-season deals this year than in previous seasons. While the salary cap number for the upcoming year is never official until late February or early March, teams are anticipating a big spike. That means that teams will want to beat others to market and lock up guys needing new deals before they learn just how much more money is available in March.Ever since the COVID true-up year of 2021, the cap has gone up fairly dramatically each season. In the four years before COVID, the cap increased on average 6.3 percent year-to-year. In the four years since that 2021 true-up, the cap has increased an average of 11.2 percent year-to-year.One league source anticipates next year's jump will be even bigger than the past few years, which saw a spike of 13.6 percent year-to-year in 2024 and 9.3 percent this past year.Teams like the Titans and Falcons could be wise to get extensions done earlier for players like Jeffrey Simmons and Drake London, respectively, knowing they wish to retain their services for years to come. While it's known the Cowboys want to keep George Pickens, might the Packers try to hash out a deal with Rasheed Walker before mid-March? What about Devin Lloyd in Jacksonville?Those are some of the big names, and it will take the players being willing to accept the deals early in order to come to an agreement. But that could lead to another blow to the big free-agency bonanza that used to take place every March.Why punt returners are going bananasBefore this year, it had been a half-decade since a player returned more than one punt for a touchdown in a season. Through Week 13 this year, three guys have done it.New England's Marcus Jones, Jacksonville's Parker Washington and Tennessee's Chimere Dike each have two so far this season. Jones got his Monday night in his 13th game while  Washington and Dike have done it in 12 games.Nyheim Hines was the last player with multiple punt return touchdowns, doing so in 2019 for the Colts. Before him, Jamal Agnew did it in 2017. But not since 2016 have there been three players with two or more punt return touchdowns. And you have to go all the way back to 2008 to have four players with two-plus punt return touchdowns.Here's what's even more impressive: there are fewer punts than ever before. As recently as 2016, there was an average of 4.5 punts per game. But thanks to better starting field position and coaches being more aggressive on fourth downs, that number dropped to a modern-low of 3.76 puts per game last season. And through 13 weeks there have been just 3.65 punts per game. So these three players are getting these returns with fewer chances than ever.What gives? Each of these six returns have come against different teams, so there's no weak link to bully.Instead, I'm reminded of the story I wrote back in September when we saw a rash of blocked punts and kicks. The common thread among the special teams coaches I spoke with was there is less practice time than ever before on those plays, in large part because of the time now allocated to the dynamic kickoff. Not to mention, the typical body types of special teamers have changed from team to team because of the new kickoff.It's reasonable to assume all of that has had a trickledown effect on other areas of special teams. The 11 punt return touchdowns through 13 weeks are the most since there were 12 returned by this point in 2015, and that was with 255 more punts.There has been so much talk about how the 'K' balls have impacted field goals, and I understand it to a point. Kickers have attempted 15 field goals of 60 or more yards with eight makes compared to four out of 10 through Week 13 last year (even though there were more attempts of 50-plus yarders last year with better accuracy.) But I think all that talk has obscured a far more fascinating special teams story about how the dynamic kickoff has had greater and more consequential ripple effects across the sport.Key to Carolina turnaround: Morgan's touch at WRA quick bye week shoutout to Panthers GM Dan Morgan and the Carolina front office. When it comes to the receiver position specifically, the former linebacker deserves high marks. He and his group took Tetairoa McMillan eighth overall in the draft when some teams weren't as sold on him, and now he's a month from securing the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.A year earlier, Morgan took Xavier Legette at the end of the first round, and Carolina could use more from him. But Morgan also nabbed Jalen Coker, an important piece of the rotation, in undrafted free agency. But beyond acquiring receivers, look at what he's been able to get for the receivers no longer in Charlotte.Last year he got a fourth-round pick for Jonathan Mingo, who has caught five passes in nine games for the Cowboys. He got a fifth for a sixth in sending Diontae Johnson to Baltimore, and Johnson has caught three passes for two teams while spending time with a third since the deal.And this week the Vikings waived Adam Thielen after sending Morgan what amounts to a fourth-round pick for the veteran, who had just eight catches before being released.There's plenty of work ahead of the 7-6 Panthers, but Morgan should be able to enjoy the bye week a little better.Housekeeping note on front office tagsI'm told the NFL is expecting to make things clearer for teams as it relates to who is the true \"primary football executive\" within teams.The PFE is typically known as the general manager for teams. That person has the usual GM duties, though final say over the 53-man roster has not been a requirement when determining the PFE.But in recent years, teams have created more complex structures in their front offices. In Tennessee, for example, Chad Brinker is the president of football operations and Mike Borgonzi is the GM. Borgonzi is considered the PFE, though there was a lot of conversation at the time of the hire between the team and league about that designation. Both men are listed under the team's \"football executive leadership.\"The league aims to make the PFE job duties more descriptive, and it will be up to the league office -- and not the teams -- on making the determination moving forward.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The college football regular season is over and the postseason begins for several teams this weekend. Conference championships are on the line as the final missing piece before the College Football Playoff selections. For players in those games, it's an opportunity to showcase their talents on one of the game's biggest stages and with so many other competitors sidelined at home,A dozen NFL teams without postseason aspirations of their own should be tuning in for an early opportunity to scout some of the 2026 NFL Draft's best prospects. Here is one to watch for each team with a sub .500 record:    Conference championship schedule    Friday  Sun Belt: Troy vs. James Madison (7 p.m.)Conference USA: Kennesaw State vs. Jacksonville State (7 p.m.)American: Tulane vs. North Texas (8 p.m.)Mountain West: UNLV vs. Boise State (8 p.m.)  Saturday  Big 12: BYU vs. Texas Tech (12 p.m.)MAC: Miami (OH) vs. Western Michigan (12 p.m.)SEC: Georgia vs. Alabama (4 p.m.)Big Ten: Indiana vs. Ohio State (8 p.m.)ACC: Duke vs. Virginia (8 p.m.)\n        \n            \n                The Six Pack: Picks for Alabama vs. Georgia, Texas Tech vs. BYU and Tom Fornelli's lock of the week\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tDavison Igbinosun, CB, Ohio State  Atlanta probably wished it had a bit more confidence in Michael Penix Jr. moving forward, but the organization is not going to cut bait yet. It has assembled a good collection of skill players. The focus should be a continuation of building up a young defense.Igbinosun is not going to be a first-round pick, but he is a good compliment to A.J. Terrell, who will have three years remaining on his second contract. Igbinosun is expected to be a Day 2 selection.   \nThe Falcons do not own the rights to their first-round pick. For that reason, Rams fans may have come here expecting to find their team listed. Although not in this exercise, Los Angeles may want to fixate on Alabama offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech  The Cardinals could conceivably target Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson or one of the other top quarterback prospects to replace Kyler Murray. However, a quarterback may not be in the cards.   The Cardinals could continue building out that young defense with a pass rusher like Bailey. Among players with at least 250 pass rush snaps, Bailey ranks first in pressure rate (22.7%), according to TruMedia. His 12.5 sacks are also the most in college football.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State  The Bengals defense, in general, has been underwhelming to the surprise of no one. The team has drafted defensive players, but seen little return.Downs may be one of the best prospects in this class, but he gets dinged since he plays a position considered low priority. Cincinnati may feel differently having seen its safeties take meandering routes to the ball-carrier and not finishing tackles in space. His older brother, wide receiver Josh Downs, was a second-round pick by the Colts.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana  Some are still holding out hope that Shedeur Sanders is the answer at quarterback for the Browns, but the reality is that nothing can be done over the final five games to convince them not to take a quarterback.   The defense is arguably the best in the league and yet the offense has been hampered year after year by poor quarterback play. Mendoza is a big body who makes good decisions and throws an average football. He has proven capable of winning in non-traditional environments like California and Indiana, so there is no reason to believe Cleveland would be any different.  \n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 3.0: Wide-open QB race creates chaos at the top of board\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State  When Jakobi Meyers was traded to Jacksonville, the Raiders were left cobbling together a pass-catching unit that features Tre Tucker, Tyler Lockett, Jack Bech and others. They certainly need to build up the offensive line and, more importantly, the defense, but few are going to have the impact of Tate.   \nQuarterback will be in the conversation, but the team may need to have a top-two pick to ensure itself a bite at the apple.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tJermaine Mathews Jr., CB, Ohio State  It was evident cornerback would be an issue for the Dolphins coming into the season, and that sentiment remains true. Mathews has stepped into a larger role this season and delivered with a forced fumble and two interceptions for the national championship contender.   \nThe team spent ample resources on the defensive interior and now must address the secondary. Wide receiver is another spot with Tyreek Hill's salary cap hit almost surely paving his way out of town this offseason.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State  The fifth Buckeye on the list, but certainly not the last. Styles may be overshadowed by teammate Arvell Reese, but is worth early-round consideration of his own. His father, Lorenzo, was a third-round pick of the Falcons in 1995. Styles would step into a Vikings defense allowing the 10th-most rushing yards per game.   \nIn this scenario, Styles would be a potential trade-up target from the second round if he were not to fall to them.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tOmar Cooper Jr., WR, Indiana  The jury is still out on second-round quarterback selection Tyler Shough. The Saints shipped Rashid Shaheed to the Pacific Northwest.If quarterback is not the play in Round 1, then supporting Shough should be of the utmost priority. The NFC South welcomed rookie receivers Emeka Egbuka and Tetairoa McMillan in 2025. The division's infusion of young pass-catchers continues with Cooper, who has made big-time plays for Indiana all season.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tBrian Parker III, IOL, Duke  Jaxson Dart needs to take better care of his body in regards to running the football, but there is no question he has brought a lot of energy to a Giants offense that has been without Malik Nabers for quite some time.   If he is the quarterback of the future, then the franchise needs to take steps towards protecting him. Parker has played right tackle, but will transition inside at the next level.   Duke, despite having five losses, has an opportunity to win the ACC with a win over No. 17 Virginia.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State  In some cases, it can be difficult to identify a team's needs, but the Jets may as well have sent one of those planes at the beach pulling a banner that reads \"defensive tackle and cornerback.\" Jarvis Brownlee Jr. has shown promise since coming over from Tennessee, which leaves defensive tackle as the bigger of two needs.   McDonald would be a target with the second of the team's two first-round picks or in the second round.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Arvell Reese, EDGE, Ohio State  The Titans parted ways with head coach Brian Callahan. The team will be seeking new leadership once the season ends, and that will inform its roster-building strategy, but pass rusher is expected to be a need regardless of who is coaching.   \nReese is listed as a linebacker, but has shown a lot of promise as a pass rusher. The transition has worked well for others like Micah Parsons and Abdul Carter. Reese could be equally successful making the transition.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tZachariah Branch, WR, Georgia  Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel will each be 30 years old or older next season. Samuel is on an expiring contract. Wide receiver is not a position in which age and experience are advantages. The Commanders must consider preparations for a future with Jayden Daniels.   Branch is dynamic after the catch. In theory, he would be a Day 2 target for the Commanders.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh. More draft coverage can be found at CBSSports.com, including the weekly mock drafts and a regularly available look at the eligible prospects.   \n            ",

Carter Bahns here to preview college football's conference championship games and an NFL slate loaded with playoff implications. We'll also take a look ahead to this afternoon's highly anticipated FIFA World Cup Draw and Saturday's potentially historic UFC 323 event. Oh, and the coaching carousel is still spinning. I know, I know, the sky is blue. But you won't want to miss the latest updates. Let's dive in.  🏈 Five things to know Friday Lions' playoffs hopes get brighter while Cowboys' hopes dim with a loss on 'TNF.' Thursday night's game was going to provide the winner with a better -- though not assured -- path to the playoffs. However, the odds of the loser advancing to the postseason were grim. And that's exactly where the Cowboys find themselves after being outplayed by the Lions. Detroit won, 44-30, behind three touchdowns by Jahmyr Gibbs, who is now tied with Barry Sanders for the most scores from scrimmage before turning 24. Dallas lost CeeDee Lamb (concussion) during the third quarter while Brandon Aubrey continues to kick into the NFL record books.Penn State might finally have its man … plus more moves on the coaching carousel. The Nittany Lions' bizarre search continues with another twist. After whiffing on numerous candidates, athletic director Pat Kraft has now turned his focus toward Matt Campbell. Can he finally get a deal done? I wrote about the potential hire and what it would mean for both sides. Elsewhere on the college football coaching carousel, Kansas State hired Collin Klein to succeed the retiring Chris Klieman, Billy Napier found a landing spot back in the Group of Six with James Madison and UAB will go in-house with its hire by elevating Alex Mortensen. Florida is also set to make a splashy assistant hire with Buster Faulkner poised to arrive as offensive coordinator from Georgia Tech.Tune in today to the FIFA World Cup draw. For the 42 teams that have already qualified for next summer's World Cup, today is a pivotal day that determines their path to glory. Who will land in the Group of Death? Might the United States get a favorable draw as it gears up to host the tournament next summer? We will find out at noon ET when the 48 total teams are placed in 12 groups of four. Here are the major storylines we're focusing on for the draw, which you can follow live here. College football conference championship games begin tonight. A quartet of Group of Six games kicks off championship week, including the important battle between No. 20 Tulane and No. 24 North Texas, wherein the American Conference winner will all but guarantee itself a spot in the College Football Playoff. Each of the Power Four matchups on Saturday will influence the bracket, too. At face value, the Big Ten Championship Game is the most compelling considering it features the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the country in unbeaten Ohio State and Indiana. That showdown may also determine which quarterback, either Julian Sayin and Fernando Mendoza, wins the Heisman Trophy.Playoff implications are aplenty as the NFL's regular season enters its final month. Five divisions are separated by a game or less entering Week 14, which makes this the most wide-open Super Bowl race in league history. More bubble teams will be in action on Sunday, like the Texans and Chiefs, who will go head-to-head in a critical AFC contest in Kansas City. 🥊 Do not miss this: Will Merab Dvalishvili make history at UFC 323? \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            No UFC champion has ever defended a bantamweight title 14 consecutive times, but that could change on Saturday when Merab Dvalishvili clashes with Petr Yan. \"The Machine\" defeated Yan by decision in March 2023 and would make history if he repeats at UFC 323 against a challenger on a three-fight winning streak. \nBrent Brookhouse dished out his best bets for UFC 323 and likes the chances of Dvalishvili not only securing his 14th straight title defense but also doing so in convincing fashion. He's picking Dvalishvili to win by KO/TKO/DQ or submission at +450 odds. Brookhouse: \"Dvalishvili is -395 to win, and he should be expected to get the victory unless a fourth weight cut in a single calendar year has him physically diminished. I have a feeling Dvalishvili will be out to prove a point against Yan.\"This is also the final UFC event of the ESPN era. UFC 324 on Jan. 24 ushers in a new chapter as the partnership with Paramount+ takes effect with an incredible debut card.  ✅ Week 14 NFL expert picks \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are in agreement on the Jaguars defeating the Colts straight-up and the Eagles covering a 2.5-point spread. They're split on most of the other critical Week 14 battles, though. Check out their full slate of picks, and read on below for their cases for and against playoff hopefuls in a couple incredibly tight divisions. \nAFC North: Steelers at Ravens Dajani (Steelers +5.5): \"The Ravens are definitely winning this game (in my opinion), so the issue is the spread. The Ravens have failed to cover in three straight games, and are 1-5 ATS in their past six home games.\" Prediction: Ravens 23, Steelers 20Dubin (Ravens -5.5): \"Pittsburgh's offense just doesn't have enough to hang -- even with a Ravens offense that is struggling in its own right.\" Prediction: Ravens 23, Steelers 13NFC North: Bears at Packers Dajani (Packers -6.5): \"No offense to Caleb Williams, but the Bears find themselves at 9-3 because of a defense that forces turnovers and a fantastic rushing attack. However, the Packers have turned the ball over an NFL-low seven times this season, and allow under 100 rushing yards per game.\" Prediction: Packers 28, Bears 20Dubin (Bears +6.5): \"The Bears can scheme up explosive plays in the passing game but aren't particularly consistent down to down, and I trust Green Bay's passing game more at the moment. The Packers come away with a win here, but the Bears keep it close.\" Prediction: Packers 26, Bears 21 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Tune in!

    "body": "\n        It's been a wacky NFL season -- in a good way. This is actually the first time in NFL history there are five divisions with a lead of less than one game this late in a season! The Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers lead the way at 6-6 in the AFC North with the Cincinnati Bengals lurking, the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks are both 9-3, and the Jacksonville Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts are both 8-4.This week in the NFL, the Dallas Cowboys put their three-game win streak on the line against Dan Campbell's Detroit Lions, Joe Burrow and Josh Allen face off in Buffalo, and rookies Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders meet for the first time in Cleveland. Times are also getting desperate for the 6-6 Kansas City Chiefs, who host the Houston Texans on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Which teams should you pick in Week 14, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken from FanDuel Sportsbook on Wednesday. New users can get $150 in bonus bets on a winning $5 wager.Dallas Cowboys at Detroit Lions (-3) (TNF)Dajani (Cowboys +3): Are the Cowboys \"America's Team\" again? I don't know, there's something endearing about seeing a high-powered offense that had no defense to start the year experience a defensive turnaround to get above .500. Shoutout Quinnen Williams, Logan Wilson, DeMarvion Overshown and Shavon Revel Jr. As for the Lions, this defense has not been up to snuff, and the offense could be without Sam LaPorta AND Amon-Ra St. Brown. Detroit ranks first in yards per play with St. Brown on the field since 2021, and 25th without him. Prediction: Cowboys 26, Lions 23\nDubin (Lions -3): I know Dallas is red hot. I know Detroit is dealing with some injuries. But I have the feeling that one of these two teams is a playoff team, and it's the home team, which means they need to win this game. The Cowboys defense has looked better these last few weeks but has also played two broken offenses in Vegas and Philly and then given up four touchdowns to Kansas City. I think the Lions can score to keep up with the Cowboys here, and then pull it out at the end. Prediction: Lions 32, Cowboys 28Cincinnati Bengals at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Dajani (Bengals +5.5): I knew the Bengals were going to cover the spread vs. Baltimore with Joe Burrow back in the lineup, but I didn't expect them to actually win the game! Cincinnati is 3-0 with Burrow in the lineup this season, and 1-8 without him. If we go back to last season, Burrow has won eight straight starts -- which is tied for the longest win streak of his career. Furthermore, Burrow is 2-0 against Josh Allen, and 14-3 ATS in his career as an underdog of three or more points. Again, I'm not expecting the Bengals to actually win outright, but I'll take 5.5 points. Prediction: Bills 28, Bengals 24Dubin (Bills -5.5): One of the things almost every team can do is run all over the Bengals. We just saw the Bills run all over the Steelers to the tune of 249 yards. James Cook has a chance to really go off here and help the Bills control the game throughout. If the Bengals get Tee Higgins back, then the Bengals' explosive offense could obviously keep pace, but I'm comfortable backing Buffalo's run game here. Prediction: Bills 26, Bengals 20\nIndianapolis Colts (-1.5) at Jacksonville JaguarsDajani (Jaguars +1.5): A massive, massive game in the AFC South. I find it fascinating that the Colts have not won in Jacksonville since 2014 -- going 0-9 during this stretch. The Colts have not looked fantastic as of late, and you have to wonder how much Daniel Jones' fibula injury is affecting him. The Jaguars defense is not the Texans defense, but this is the same unit that destroyed Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers, 35-6, a couple weeks ago. You never know what you're going to get with Trevor Lawrence, but I'll take Jacksonville in a small upset. Prediction: Jaguars 30, Colts 27Dubin (Jaguars +1.5): The shine is coming off the Colts, especially with their quarterback dealing with a fractured leg and barely able to move in recent weeks. (He ran once for one yard in Indy's loss to Houston on Sunday.) Jonathan Taylor is going to be asked to win this game all by himself, and I just am not sure it's fair to expect that of him. The Jags have allowed just 3.9 yards per carry on the season. Prediction: Jaguars 23, Colts 21Tennessee Titans at Cleveland Browns (-3.5)Dajani (Browns -3.5): Just a PSA, next week you're going to have to hear debates about why Shedeur Sanders should have been drafted above Cam Ward, because the Browns are going to win this game. It won't be because of Sanders' play, but because of the Browns' vaunted defense and Myles Garrett's 10 sacks on Ward. It looked like the Titans were making progress in recent weeks, but then Week 13 happened. In a 25-3 loss to the Jaguars, Tennessee went 2 of 12 on third downs and recorded just 188 yards of total offense. Believe it or not, 70 of those yards came on the first drive. For the second year in a row, Tennessee is the worst team in football. Prediction: Browns 17, Titans 6\nDubin (Titans +3.5): The Browns are a different team at home than they are on the road, so I expect them to win this game, largely on the strength of their defense. Myles Garrett might break the all-time sack record this weekend, given the matchup advantages he has here. But Cleveland's offense isn't nearly efficient or explosive enough to bet on the Browns winning by all that many points, so we have to predict a close game here. Prediction: Browns 17, Titans 14Pittsburgh Steelers at Baltimore Ravens (-5.5)Dajani (Steelers +5.5): The Ravens are definitely winning this game (in my opinion), so the issue is the spread. The Ravens have failed to cover in three straight games, and are 1-5 ATS in their past six home games. As for the Steelers, Mike Tomlin is 13-3-2 ATS and 10-8 straight up as an underdog vs. the Ravens, and has lost by four or more points in just seven of 36 matchups vs. Baltimore. Whoa. I'm just going to hope that Aaron Rodgers' little film birthday party he had with teammates helped. Prediction: Ravens 23, Steelers 20Dubin (Ravens -5.5): Pittsburgh's offense just doesn't have enough to hang -- even with a Ravens offense that is struggling in its own right. The Ravens should be able to run the ball on the Steelers. Presumably not as well as the Bills did last week, obviously. But getting Derrick Henry downhill more often should help get the passing game in rhythm as well. Lamar Jackson can't be held down like this for much longer... can he? Prediction: Ravens 23, Steelers 13\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking seven NFL Week 14 games with huge playoff implications: Lions-Cowboys, Chiefs-Texans loom large\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nChicago Bears at Green Bay Packers (-6.5)Dajani (Packers -6.5): No offense to Caleb Williams, but the Bears find themselves at 9-3 because of a defense that forces turnovers and a fantastic rushing attack. However, the Packers have turned the ball over an NFL-low seven times this season, and allow under 100 rushing yards per game. Green Bay is 3-0 vs. the NFC North this season after going 1-5 in the division last year. I understand 6.5 points is a pretty big number in a divisional matchup, but I'll take the Packers to cover the spread Sunday in the fourth quarter. Prediction: Packers 28, Bears 20Dubin (Bears +6.5): I'm fascinated to see the matchup between the Bears' run game and the Packers' run defense. Chicago has forcefully rammed the ball down its opponents' throats since taking its bye back in Week 5, while Green Bay has been able to slow almost any run game in its path. The Bears can scheme up explosive plays in the passing game but aren't particularly consistent down to down, and I trust Green Bay's passing game more at the moment. The Packers come away with a win here, but the Bears keep it close. Prediction: Packers 26, Bears 21Houston Texans at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5) (SNF)Dajani (Texans +3.5): If this number was Chiefs -1.5, I would take it. But if you're giving me the hook against a 6-6 team that has a losing ATS record, I'm probably going to side there. The Texans rank No. 1 in both scoring defense and total defense and allow an NFL-low 11.0 passing yards per game outside the pocket this season. That's usually where Patrick Mahomes thrives. Additionally, Houston is 4-0 in one-score games during this current four-game win streak. I didn't think C.J. Stroud was perfect in his return to the lineup last week, but he wasn't a disaster either. Houston loses by three points. Prediction: Chiefs 24, Texans 21\nDubin (Chiefs -3.5): I'm going down with the Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid ship. Prediction: Chiefs 23, Texans 16Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5) vs. Los Angeles Chargers (MNF)Dajani (Eagles -2.5): Yes, I have obvious questions about the Eagles as legitimate contenders, but I don't like that Justin Herbert is going to try to play days after having surgery for a fracture in his left hand. I actually really like getting the Eagles under a field goal here. Additionally, I was surprised to learn that the Eagles are 7-5 ATS this season while the Chargers are 6-6. Prediction: Eagles 27, Chargers 20Dubin (Eagles -2.5): The Justin Herbert hand surgery has me off the Chargers in this game. Even if they get Omarion Hampton back, I don't know how effective we can expect the offense to be -- even against a defense that has struggled the last two weeks. We know the type of ceiling Vic Fangio's unit can reach. Do I trust the Eagles' offense at all here? Nope. But I'll back the team whose quarterback at least is not injured. Prediction: Eagles 21, Chargers 17\n            ",

Yes. It was a winning week both ways for me with my NFL picks last week.As the NFL season winds down, I am starting to get hotter than Cleveland Browns fans when you say their quarterback of the future isn't on their current roster.I went 11-5 straight up and 9-6-1 against the spread last week with my NFL picks.

Both teams need it in the worst way. Dallas has come alive the past two weeks, while the Lions have been leaking oil. The Cowboys offense should be able to move the football here, while the improved Dallas defense will be able to limit the Lions late to win it. It's close, but the Cowboys take it.Pick: Cowboys 34, Lions 33 | Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\n        \n            \n                Cowboys vs. Lions prediction: Can Jared Goff and Co. keep up with Dak Prescott and the potent Dallas offense?\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCincinnati Bengals at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nJoe Burrow being back has brought life to the Bengals. They can't afford another loss, but beating the Bills on the road will be tough to do. The Bills ran it right at the Steelers for over 240 yards and will do the same here. The Bengals will have trouble stopping the run as the Bills control the ball and Josh Allen hits some timely throws.Pick: Bills 27, Bengals 20 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookIndianapolis Colts at Jacksonville Jaguars (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Colts have lost three of four and they now trail the Jaguars in the AFC South race. The Colts haven't won in Jacksonville since 2014, which is hard to believe. The Colts love to run the ball, but the Jaguars are No. 1 in run defense. That will put it on Daniel Jones, who is limited with a broken fibula. I don't think he can win it , while Trevor Lawrence will make plays against the Sauce Gardner-less defense. Jaguars win it.  Pick: Jaguars 21, Colts 17 | Odds via BetMGMMiami Dolphins at New York Jets (+2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Dolphins are somehow still alive in the playoff chase, while the Jets have won three of their last five games. The Dolphins haven't played well in the cold and this could be one of those games. The Jets have played better on defense lately and the offense has shown some signs of life. The defense will keep it close as they win it.  Pick: Jets 24, Dolphins 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNew Orleans Saints (+8.5) at Tampa Bay BuccaneersSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Saints are playing consecutive road games in Florida after losing to the Dolphins last week. They showed fight in that game and they seem to always show it against the Bucs. But this Tampa Bay team is pushing for a playoff spot. That matters. The Bucs win it behind a big game by their running attack.

Both teams are coming off bad losses, both at home. Neither team is playing well, but the Ravens are playing a little better. The Steelers have major defensive issues. Look for a big game by Derrick Henry as the Ravens win it behind a big rushing performance.  Pick: Ravens 27, Steelers 14 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookSeattle Seahawks (-7.5) at Atlanta FalconsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a long trip for Seattle, but the Seahawks are playing a team that is playing for nothing. That matters. The Seattle defense is really good and will travel well here and cause problems for Kirk Cousins. Sam Darnold hits a few deep shots too. Seattle wins it.Pick: Seahawks 27, Falcons 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookTennessee Titans at Cleveland Browns (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is the dog game of the day, but it does feature two quarterbacks from the 2025 draft class in Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders. Both have done some good and bad things. The Browns defense is much better than what Sanders will face. Look for the Browns to win it behind that defense.  Pick: Browns 20, Titans 10 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookWashington Commanders at Minnesota Vikings (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThese two are among the biggest disappointments this season. The Vikings will have J.J. McCarthy back at quarterback, but it will be Marcus Mariota again for the Commanders. The Vikings have the better defense, which will be the difference here.  Pick: Vikings 24, Commanders 17 | Odds via BetMGMDenver Broncos (-7.5) at Las Vegas RaidersSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Broncos are playing consecutive road gams, but it doesn't matter here. The Raiders offense is awful and the line is even worse. The Broncos' defensive front will dominate this game and get turnovers that lead to short fields. The Broncos will keep rolling.  Pick: Broncos 31, Raiders 14 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookChicago Bears at Green Bay Packers (-6.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is an enormous game in the NFC North. The Bears lead the division and are coming off an impressive road victory over the Eagles, while the Packers beat up the Lions on the road. This is Ben Johnson vs. the Packers defense in terms of the key matchup. But I think it will be a Jordan Love game. He stays hot and the Packers win it.  Pick: Packers 28, Bears 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookLos Angeles Rams (-8) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Rams are playing consecutive road games, although this is a short trip. They will be focused here after losing to the Panthers in a big upset last week. Look for Matthew Stafford to bounce back in a big way. The Cardinals have lost a lot of close games. This won't be one of them.  Pick: Rams 34, Cardinals 20 | Odds via BetMGMHouston Texans at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC \nThis is a playoff game for these two. Loser has major problems and likely won't make it. The Texans are also playing consecutive road games. But that defense is impressive. Even so, give me the Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes to stay alive in a game they have to have.  Pick: Chiefs 23, Texans 17 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookPhiladelphia Eagles (-3) at Los Angeles ChargersMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles are coming off a horrible home loss to the Bears where they were mauled in the run game. The Chargers won last week, but quarterback Justin Herbert injured his non-throwing hand. That has to impact him some this week. I think the Eagles will get back on track here against a bad Chargers offensive line and the Philly run game will get going. Pick: Eagles 26, Chargers 20 | Odds via BetMGM\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two of the top three scoring offenses will meet on 'Thursday Night Football,' providing quite the NFL DFS player pool for the Dallas Cowboys vs. Detroit Lions matchup at 8:15 p.m. ET. Detroit is a 3-point home favorite, while the over/under is 54.5, the highest on the board in Week 14. Dak Prescott, Jared Goff, Jahmyr Gibbs and CeeDee Lamb are names known to casual football fans and names very familiar with being included in NFL DFS lineups. However, Detroit could be shorthanded with Sam LaPorta on the IR and Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) a game-time decision after not practicing this week. George Pickens (calf/knee) doesn't carry an injury designation for TNF.Wideout Isaac TeSlaa played 92% of snaps in Detroit's last game and scored his third touchdown of the year. Daily Fantasy football lineups need economical options like TeSlaa to balance out the highly-priced stars. The Cowboys also have NFL daily Fantasy sleepers who could provide a great return on investment on TNF.

The wideout is coming off a 7-112-1 stat line on Thanksgiving versus Kansas City, with the 112 yards matching a season high. Lamb is averaging 82.7 receiving yards per game in 2025, which ranks sixth-best in the NFL, and his career high of 227 yards came versus Detroit in 2023. This year's Lions team has allowed the third-most touchdowns to opposing wideouts, and now it will be without starting cornerback, Terrion Arnold (shoulder), who was placed on injured reserve on Monday. Detroit also allowed four touchdowns to wideouts in last week's loss to Green Bay. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also rostering Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who has been a one-man show over the last half-dozen games. Gibbs is averaging 152.3 scrimmage yards with eight total touchdowns over his last six contests, compared to 83.7 yards and five scores over his first six games. The two-time Pro Bowler is on pace for career highs in rushing yards, rushing average, receptions and receiving yards, with his 2025 production coming versus defenses much more stout than what Dallas possesses. The Cowboys have allowed the second-most points and the fourth-most yards this season, in addition to giving up the third-most receiving yards to running backs, which increases the value of a pass-catching RB like Gibbs. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Lions vs. Cowboys NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'.

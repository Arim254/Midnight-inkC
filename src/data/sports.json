    "body": "\n        The 2025 college football season has been exciting, but alas, all good things must come to an end. With the end of November here, it's time to put a bow on the regular season, and Thanksgiving weekend brings us two massive Big Ten clashes to close the festivities. On Black Friday, two rivals go head-to-head as Iowa battles with Nebraska. While neither team is in College Football Playoff contention, bragging rights will still be up for grabs. On Saturday, however, CBS will feature a team firmly in the CFP conversation as Oregon takes on rival Washington in a battle between former Pac-12 foes. In addition to the Big Ten games on the docket, CBS Sports will also feature three legs in the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy rivalry between Army, Navy and Air Force. Army-Navy, of course, will be in its historic spot on the calendar, this year taking place on Dec. 13 in Baltimore. Check out the full schedule below, and then below the table a closer look at the matchups that will be featured as part of the early Big Ten on CBS schedule.      \n   Fall 2025 CBS college football schedule   DateTime (ET)GameSat., Aug. 23  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t7:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tStanford at Hawaii  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Aug. 30  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tNevada at Penn State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 6  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOklahoma State at Oregon  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 13  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tUSC at Purdue  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 20  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.         7:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMichigan at Nebraska         Washington at Washington State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 27  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOhio State at WashingtonSat., Oct. 4  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t12 p.m.         3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAir Force at NavyPenn State at UCLASat., Oct. 11  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tIndiana at OregonSat., Oct. 18  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOhio State at WisconsinSat., Oct. 25  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMinnesota at IowaSat., Nov. 1  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t12 p.m.         3:30 p.m.       7:30 p.m.    \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tArmy at Air ForceIndiana at Maryland        Washington State at Oregon State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Nov. 8  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOregon at IowaSat., Nov. 15  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.    \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tPenn State at Michigan StateFri., Nov. 22  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tUSC at OregonFri., Nov. 28  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t12 p.m.      4 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tIowa at Nebraska      Boise State at Utah State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Nov. 29  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOregon at WashingtonSat., Dec. 13  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tArmy-Navy Game  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tWed., Dec. 31  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTony The Tiger Sun Bowl \t\t\t\tNow let's highlight the announced games for Big Ten on CBS in 2025. You can also watch on Paramount+ Premium. Iowa at Nebraska (11/27)Expect a close one on Black FridayIowa and Nebraska have delivered thrills nearly every Thanksgiving weekend for the last decade, and the small margins between the two programs has always packed intensity into their respective regular season finales. The interesting twist here is that while nine of the last 11 games in the rivalry have been decided by seven points or less, nine of the last 11 games have also been won by Iowa. If Matt Rhule and the Cornhuskers are going to have a true breakthrough season in 2025 it doesn't need to include a win over the Hawkeyes necessarily, but it would definitely help the vibes to finish the regular season by snapping this recent run of struggles.CBS Sports will announce additional details on its 2025 roster of game and studio announcers at a later date.Oregon at Washignton (11/28)Ducks look to punch CFP ticket against upset-minded Huskies A week after dominating No. 15 USC in Eugene to improve to 10-1, the Ducks will face another former Pac-12 rival in Washington, but will have to go on the road as they aim to wrap up a College Football Playoff berth with a victory. A win in Week 14 would lock the Ducks into an at-large berth, and give them a chance at reaching the Big Ten Championship game in Indianapolis depending on how Ohio State and Indiana fare in their final games of the season against Michigan and Purdue, respectively. The 7-3 Huskies will be looking to play spoiler as home underdogs against Oregon. Washington has presented a much different challenge for opponents in Husky Stadium compared to their road performances, and figure to bring their best to try and ruin Oregon's clean path to the Playoff. The Huskies' lone home loss on the season was a 24-6 defensive struggle against Ohio State, but they've put up 42 and 49 points in their last two home games, blowout wins over No. 21 Illinois and Purdue. \n            ",

The honor of retiring Cena must be earned, though, as WWE superstars are currently battling in The Last Time is Now Tournament, with the winner ultimately becoming his final opponent in Washington, DC.Competition in The Last Time is Now Tournament began on the Nov. 10 episode of Monday Night Raw, and it is continuing the two weekly shows, leading into the fifth and final Saturday Night's Main Event of 2025.Superstars from every rung of the WWE ladder are competing for the unique opportunity to show Cena the door. The 16-man field includes both day-to-day superstars from Raw and SmackDown, popular NXT wrestlers like Je'Von Evans, and classic rivals like The Miz.Two surprise entrants from Cena's past also competed in the tournament. Zack Ryder returned for a one-off match on SmackDown, and Dolph Ziggler received a warm ovation for his match on Raw.\nRusev and Sheamus, each with a longstanding history of fighting Cena, were the first to advance to the quarterfinals. However, Sheamus pulled out before the quarterfinals with a shoulder injury. Jey Uso overcame The Miz, while LA Knight spoiled Ryder's WWE return to advance. A returning GUNTHER and Solo Sikoa have also progressed.Now, the quarterfinals are set with some interesting matchups. GUNTHER will take on Hayes on Raw, while Sikoa will face Penta. Then on SmackDown, Rusev will face Jey Uso while LA Knight will await an opponent to be named after Sheamus' injury.\nTake a look below at the tournament schedule, results, and upcoming match dates. WWE has not yet released an official bracket, but once it does, CBS Sports will update the matchups accordingly.

    "body": "\n        All Elite Wrestling returns with its penultimate pay-per-view of the year, AEW Full Gear. \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Samoa Joe run back their world championship match from WrestleDream, but this time, inside a steel cage. \"Hangman\" beat Joe for the first time last month after multiple failed attempts of the year. Their hostilities only escalated after Joe and his faction, The Opps, attacked \"Hangman\" post-match. On Saturday, Page gets Joe to himself in a steel cage.Full Gear will also crown the inaugural National champion, a title intended to be defended in promotions beyond just AEW. Bobby Lashley and Shelton Benjamin, Hurt Syndicate teammates, will be the first participants in the Casino Gauntlet match. The innovative match starts with two participants. New entrants join the fray at timed intervals; however, the match can end by pinfall or submission at any time. In theory, the match could end with two or 21 participants in the ring. Other notable stars wrestling at Full Gear include TBS champion Mercedes Mone, former world champions Jon Moxley and Kenny Omega, and AEW stalwart Darby Allin. Omega, considered one of the best wrestlers in the world who never competed in WWE, admits he has been thinking about when he will retire.\n\"I've been thinking a lot about when that timing would be. Another important thing for me is, when I finally do leave, whenever that may be, and this might sound odd, I don't want people to be sad,\" Omega told CBS Sports. \"In fact, the best-case scenario for me is that they don't realize I'm gone at all. I'd love to have the peace of mind that the company has built enough stars so that their star is shining bright enough to distract from me stepping away from the scene. That would make me most happy.\"Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWatch 2025 AEW Full GearDate: Nov. 22Location: Prudential Center -- Newark, New JerseyStart time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: HBO Max, Prime Video, PPV.com, YouTube, and Fubo | Price: $49.992025 AEW Full Gear match cardAEW World Championship -- \"Hangman\" Adam Page (c) vs. Samoa Joe (Steel cage match)Jox Moxley vs. Kyle O'Reilly (No Holds Barred match)AEW Women's World Championship -- Kris Statlander (c) vs. Mercedes Mone Kenny Omega & Jurassic Express (\"Jungle\" Jack Perry &  Luchasaurus) vs. The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson & Nick Jackson) &  Josh Alexander  AEW Women's Tag Team Championship -- Babes of Wrath (Willow & Harley Cameron) vs. Sisters of Sin (Julia Hart & Skye Blue) vs. Timeless Love Bombs (\"Timeless\" Toni Storm & Mina Shirakawa) vs. Megan Bayne & Marina ShafirDarby Allin vs. PacTNT Championship -- Kyle Fletcher (c) vs. Mark Briscoe (No Disqualification match)*National Championship -- Bobby Lashley vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Ricochet vs. Kevin Knight vs. \"Speedball\" Mike Bailey vs. More TBA (Casino Gauntlet match)AEW Tag Team Championships -- Brodido (Bandido & Brody King) (c) vs. FTR (Cash Wheeler & Dax Harwood)Hook & Eddie Kingston vs. WorkHorsemen (Anthony Henry vs. JD Drake)CMLL World Trios Championships -- El Sky Team (Mistico, Mascara Dorada & Neon) (c) vs. The Don Callis Family (Kazuchika Okada, Konosuke Takeshita & Hechicero)The Acclaimed (Max Caster & Anthony Bowens) vs. Bang Bang Gang (Austin Gunn & Juice Robinson) vs. Big Bill & Bryan Keith vs. The Outrunners (Truth Magnum & Turbo Floyd)Boom & Doom (\"Big Boom\" A.J. & Q.T.

    "body": "\n        Teams desperate to get in the win column meet on Sunday when the Las Vegas Raiders (1-8) face the Cleveland Browns (2-7) in NFL Week 12 action on CBS and Paramount+. Cleveland has lost three straight, but did cover as a 7.5-point underdog last week against the Ravens. Las Vegas, meanwhile, has dropped four straight overall, but has covered in two of its last three. Despite struggling this season, the Raiders are expected to stick with Geno Smith at quarterback, while the Browns plan to start rookie Shedeur Sanders for the first time with Dillon Gabriel in concussion protocol. Kickoff from Allegiant Stadium is set for 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. Las Vegas is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Raiders vs. Browns odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 36.5.

It starts with quarterback concerns for both teams, but these sides also lack many game-breaking skill players to help them. Running back Ashton Jeanty was supposed to be just that for Las Vegas, but has averaged just 3.7 yards per carry this season. Quinshon Judkins has been a bit more effective for Cleveland, but only one player for either side -- Raiders receiver Tre Tucker (502 yards) -- has more than 500 receiving yards on the season. These teams, however, both have a game-wrecker coming off the edge. Cleveland's Myles Garrett leads the NFL with 15 sacks, while Maxx Crosby of the Raiders has six sacks and ranks third in the NFL in tackles for loss with 14. How these offensive lines contain those players could be an x-factor in who wins what is expected to be a low-scoring battle. Click here to bet Raiders vs. Browns at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Raiders vs. Browns score prediction, picksBoth teams are 4-6 against the spread, and Cleveland has been especially poor on the road with an 0-4 ATS mark. Despite that, the model is projecting an extremely low-scoring game, and that often is a case for backing the team getting points, as the Browns are in this spot.

    "body": "\n        The New Orleans Saints (2-8) host the Atlanta Falcons (3-7) in an NFC South matchup on Sunday afternoon between two franchises more so with their eyes on next season. Both teams are significant longshots to make the postseason, even with Tampa Bay leading the division with just a 6-4 record. The Falcons have lost five straight games and turn to veteran Kirk Cousins after Michael Penix Jr. suffered a season-ending knee injury last week. The Saints are coming off a bye week following a 17-7 victory over the Panthers in rookie quarterback Tyler Shough's second start of the season. This is their first head-to-head matchup of the season.Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. ET from Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. According to the latest NFL odds, the Saints are favored by 2.5 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 39.5. The Saints are -132 money line favorites (risk $132 to win $100), while the Falcons are +112 underdogs. Click here to bet Falcons vs. Saints at FanDuel, where new users get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Where to bet on Saints vs. FalconsBrandPromoPromo CodeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 Months of NBA League PassJust click herebet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets instantly CBSBET365BetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSCaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBS20XFanDuelBet $5, get $150 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash  CBSFANWhere to watch Falcons vs. Saints on SundayWhen: Sunday, Nov. 23Time: 4:25 p.m. ETTV: FOXFollow along: CBS Sports AppSaints vs. Falcons betting previewOdds: Saints -2.5, over/under 39.5It's been a challenging week for Atlanta, which found out Michael Penix Jr. will miss the remainder of the season with a knee injury, and star wide receiver Drake London (knee) is out this week as well. Kirk Cousins will start, and the 37-year-old looked his age in his first start, completing 21 of 31 passes for 173 yards and no touchdowns in a 34-10 loss to the Dolphins in Week 8. Cousins has been a reliable starter for the majority of his NFL career, and the Falcons hope he has a few more of those performances left. Expectations weren't high for Kellen Moore in his first season as the New Orleans head coach, and although the Saints only have two victories, three of their eight losses have come in one-score contests, so they haven't been totally outclassed. The Saints are favored for just the second time this season, and the only other time they were favored, New Orleans defeated the Giants, 26-14, on their home field. They'll seek a similar result on Sunday, coming off just their second win of the season before a bye week.Model's Falcons vs. Saints score prediction, picksThe SportsLine Projection Model knows that the Falcons will rely on one of the best running back tandems in Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier, as the Falcons are 13th in the NFL in yards per rush (4.5). It also knows the Saints have a big-play receiver in Chris Olave, who had 104 yards and a touchdown in his last game against the Panthers and is 15th in the NFL at 664 receiving yards. The model has New Orleans winning by one point, but its top pick is the Over (39.5), as it is projecting 47 total points. Falcons vs. Saints score prediction: Saints 24, Falcons 23Falcons vs. Saints SGPOver 40.5 (-105)Tyler Shough Over 201.5 passing yards (-114)Tyler Shough Over 0.5 interceptions (-117)Final odds: +405 (wager $100 to win $405)Click here to bet Saints vs. Falcons at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Want more Week 12 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for New Orleans Saints vs. Atlanta Falcons.

    "body": "\n        As Trinity Rodman stood on the touchline at PayPal Park early in the 56th of the NWSL Championship, it was hard not to notice she was giving the audience what they were waiting for. The noise from the sellout crowd swelled, their largest cheer of the night thus far audible despite the cacophony that is the signature of a sports broadcast.Quite simply, she is the star many had traveled from different parts of the country to see, the standout who motivated others to turn on their screens on a Saturday evening. Rodman is the headline-grabber in a league full of them, the elite athlete commissioner Jessica Berman said the NWSL \"will fight\" to keep, the type of player who forces existential questions of a new type for a growing league. Rodman is a classic game-changer in a match that needed one, still goalless with about a half-hour left on the clock.\nHer star power, though, was not enough.It was not a failure of her creation, truth be told. Gotham FC's 1-0 win over the Washington Spirit on Saturday came as a result of the eventual NWSL champions' remarkable ability to grind an opposition defense down and render them irrelevant no matter their might, this time limiting the Spirit to just 0.49 expected goals and zero shots on target despite having the likes of Gift Monday, Croix Bethune and Sofia Cantore on the pitch before Rodman's arrival. Rodman was a victim of the grueling exercises Gotham's defense puts attackers through, coming up with zero shots in a quiet return to the NWSL Championship a month after sustaining an MCL sprain.The result, in some sense, was a showcase of the NWSL's greatest attribute – its collection of stars and champions, spread out across the league's 14 teams. Rose Lavelle's game-winning goal in the 80th minute was a classic example of individual brilliance. Gotham, too, were struggling in attack and only ended the game with 0.39 expected goals of their own, the game desperately calling out for a game-changer who would live up to the billing. Lavelle, who scored in the Women's World Cup final six years ago with the U.S. women's national team, had another big moment in a final and collected her first NWSL title – and MVP honors – in the process.\nGotham are just as star-studded and accomplished as the Spirit. Jaedyn Shaw has played a serious role in the team's playoff run with three goal contributions on their four total goals in the postseason, while international title-winners like goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger and center back Emily Sonnett stood out on Saturday. They may have entered the postseason as the lowest-ranked seed but underdog was a misnomer of a label for a team like this one, fully living up to the hype to win their second title.The sheer number of stars makes star power inherently unpredictable – someone's individual talents will eventually break through but it becomes hard to guess whose will, one of the NWSL's greatest sources of entertainment value. That quality will not fade if one, or two, or three stars leave the league; the number of high-profile players plentiful in NWSL for the time being. Not all stars are created equal, though, and Rodman's status is as clear an example as any of that concept.The NWSL is in a natural period of transition, previous standouts like Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe coming to the end of their storied careers, paving the way for the next generation. While the full collection of rising talents continues to take shape, Rodman is clearly the leader of the pack – her on-field ability and accolades speak for themselves but she has the mix of tangibles and intangibles that command attention, making her a covetable player by just about every team on the planet. There is no question that the mantle is hers to take – who she chooses to take along with her on the ride is not a question for the future but now the NWSL's top concern, the 2025 season done and dusted.Rodman said she has yet to make a decision but her quiet 33-minute showing on Saturday is almost a perfect setup for what's to come. With interest in England's Women's Super League and the USL Super League, a fellow Division I league in the U.S., Rodman has fully placed her fate in the NWSL's hands. Update the salary cap rules that currently restrict her return to the Spirit and Rodman can share her talents with the NWSL once again, the pair growing together as women's sports' undeniable rise continues. Should Rodman take her skills elsewhere, the NWSL's moment of transition becomes a lot harder to navigate.\nRodman's performance on Saturday may not have done so but the roar of 18,000 fans in San Jose offers a stark reminder of what's at stake for the NWSL in a new chapter of the women's game, one that no longer asks the power-that-be simply to pay attention but to be intentional and impactful in their investment. The league's next decisions may revolve around Rodman but it will also lay the foundation for the stars that come after her, whether they currently play in the NWSL or not.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Oregon Ducks moved a major step closer to another trip to the College Football Playoff on Saturday with an impressive 42-27 home win over No. 15 USC in the biggest game of the Week 13 schedule. That win improved them to 10-1 on the season and makes next week's game at Washington a \"win and in\" situation for the Ducks, whether they make the Big Ten title game or not. In his postgame press conference, Oregon coach Dan Lanning was asked what he hopes the College Football Playoff committee takes away from the Ducks' play this season, and he couldn't help but take a swipe at the SEC, where many of the top contenders were playing Sun Belt, Conference USA or FCS opponents.\"We just played a really good team and we beat them,\" Lanning said. \"A lot of times we play really good teams that become unranked all of a sudden, that's not our fault, right -- maybe it is our fault -- but all that we're worried about is playing the teams we play and doing the job we need to do and we did that job today. I think that the proof's in the pudding. We played a good team and we beat them. All we can do next week is try and do the same thing. \n\"This conference is a really good conference. It's competitive. We didn't play Chattanooga State today, like some other places. We competed. So with that being said, it's tough playing nine conference games. It's tough playing in this league, and we got to take advantage of playing a good team today and attacking that.\"First off, UT Chattanooga is the only college football program in Chattanooga (Chattanooga State does exist but doesn't have a football program) and, as Dan Mullen will tell you, they're an excellent football team. Second, I think the response from most SEC programs would be to ask what the difference is between opening your season with an FCS opponent, as Oregon did, and playing one at the end of it -- to Oregon's credit, they did face a good FCS team in Montana State.What Lanning's doing is understandable though, as so much gets made of the challenge of the SEC week-to-week, while the Big Ten doesn't get the same respect. A lot of that comes down to the fact that the bottom of the Big Ten looks considerably worse than the top of it, but there's certainly an argument to be made that the middle class of the Big Ten doesn't get the respect they deserve relative to similar programs in the SEC. \nThat's the more salient point in Lanning's answer here, but stumping for the Big Ten being better top to bottom than it's been credited for wouldn't grab headlines in the same way as the Chattanooga State swipe. Lanning is just doing his part to stump for his team to get the best possible seeding, for whatever that's worth for a team that almost assuredly won't be in the top 4, and couldn't resist a chance at a drive-by on his SEC rivals on a week where his team got to enjoy the spotlight mostly to themselves. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In what amounted to a College Football Playoff elimination game between two top-15 titans in the Big Ten, No. 7 Oregon kept its conference championship and national title hopes alive Saturday with a spirited 42-27 win over No. 15 USC.The Ducks (9-2) need a win at Washington and a Michigan victory over Ohio State next week to reach the Big Ten Championship Game for the second straight season as the league's reigning champion.The loss for the Trojans (8-3) eliminates the Trojans team from various league title scenarios and now, the race will be decided during rivalry weekend with unbeatens Ohio State and Indiana leading the way ahead of Oregon and Michigan, a 45-20 winner at Maryland.Oregon never trailed following Malik Benson's 85-yard punt return midway through the second quarter and put it away with Noah Whittington's touchdown run with 5:30 to play after USC had cut a two-score deficit to eight points on Jayden Maiva's to Lake McRee in the final frame.\nBefore getting to what Oregon's victory means in the overall playoff picture, here's a glance at how updated Big Ten Championship scenarios coming out of Week 12:Big Ten tiebreakers, explained The tied teams will be compared based on head-to-head matchups during the regular season.The tied teams will be compared based on record against all common conference opponents.The tied teams will be compared based on record against common opponents with the best conference record and proceeding through the common conference opponents based on their order of finish within the conference standings. The tied teams will be compared based on the best cumulative conference winning percentage of all conference opponents.The representative will be chosen based on the highest ranking by SportSource Analytics (team Rating Score metric) following the regular season.The representative will be chosen by random draw among the tied teams conducted by the commissioner or designee.Big Ten Championship scenarios after Oregon's winIf Oregon beats Washington next weekend and Michigan beats Ohio State, the Ducks are in the title game.If Michigan beats Ohio State and Washington beats Oregon, the Wolverines are in the title game.If Ohio State beats Michigan, the Buckeyes are in the title game.If Indiana beats Purdue, the Hoosiers are in the title game.Michigan has won four straight over the Buckeyes, but an upset of top-ranked Ohio State next week would be the most improbable victory in the current stretch of success.For the Ducks to secure an opening-round home game, they're going to need to beat Washington on the road during rivalry weekend. A loss for Oregon and a 10-2 finish would put them team in a logjam with several other at-large, 10-win teams and would risk the Ducks falling behind two-loss Oklahoma and Notre Dame given the hot streak's each has shown in the final month.\nOklahoma took out No. 22 Missouri on Saturday for its third straight quality victory, while the Fighting Irish walloped Syracuse, 70-7, and have Stanford left.In CBS Sports' latest playoff bracket projection, Oregon was slotted as the 8-seed hosting No. 9 Oklahoma in December. However, should Oregon, Oklahoma and Notre Dame win out, we're expecting the Ducks to move to No. 6 in the final bracket replacing Ole Miss, which could slide should Lane Kiffin bolt to LSU.Committee chair Hunter Yurachek explained after the third playoff rankings why the Ducks were one spot ahead of the Sooners.\n\"Oregon, while their strength of schedule metric may not be as strong as an Oklahoma, we felt like they are a very strong team on both sides of the ball,\" Yurachek said. \"Offensively and defensively, they rank in the top 10 of most of the statistical categories that we use, in comparison to other teams.\"Yurachek noted Oregon's recent ranked win at Iowa and said the committee still views the victory at Penn State in September as a quality win.\"I know Penn State is not the same Penn State we expected them to be this year,\" Yurachek said. \"Still, it's a very challenging place to play as evidenced by Indiana having to have a last-second touchdown to win there a couple weeks ago. So there was significant discussion about that, but Oregon at 9-1 stayed one spot ahead of Oklahoma.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said the league \"will fight\" to keep Trinity Rodman as a bidding war of sorts emerges for the U.S. women's national team star, who will be out of contract after Saturday's NWSL Championship (8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+). Rodman's deal with the Washington Spirit, who will face Gotham FC on Saturday, expires upon the conclusion of the 2025 season with her future currently unclear. The Spirit remain in the mix to re-sign her but three clubs out of England's Women's Super League are interested, as are the USL Super League side D.C. Power, according to The Athletic.Most of the contenders for Rodman's signature, including the Power, are reportedly currently able to offer higher wages than the Spirit are because of the restraints of the NWSL's salary cap. The cap will sit at $3.3 million in 2026 and will rise incrementally each year until it reaches $5.1 million in 2030 but Rodman's contract status has raised concerns about the current structure, which Berman tried to dispel in a press conference on Thursday.\"Specifically, as it relates to Trinity and candidly, any other top player in the world, we want those top players here in the NWSL and particularly, we want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her and we are excited to see her compete in the championship on Saturday,\" Berman said.Berman said she believes the NWSL's selling points are greater than just compensation.\nHow to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190\"We really believe that there is a holistic picture that players evaluate and the reason we believe this is because we hear it from players in our league and around the world,\" she continued. \"I go and sit with the players on every single team in the NWSL every season and they tell me that yes, compensation matters but they also think about compensation not just from the perspective of what their club is paying them … We also know that our market here in the U.S. has more interest in supporting female athletes and women sports than any other market in the world and then there's all the other components outside of compensation, which I referenced earlier, the other three Css, which is the competition, the club and the coaching and we believe on a holistic basis If you're a player who wants to be performing at your best and wants to be valued and supported and feel like you have the opportunity to train in a best-in-class environment with the best-in-class league, that the NWSL is the place for you.\"The salary cap will grow as dictated by the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the NWSL Players Association, the most recent version ratified in 2024. The CBA does include the ability to raise the cap outside of the scheduled yearly increases but Berman did not signal that changes to the current structure were imminent.\"We do not believe that NWSL is a charity,\" Berman said. \"We believe it's a business and in order to treat it like a business, it means that the amount that our teams are investing has to have a rational relationship to revenue and so when we go through that process of reviewing the overall ecosystem and the value proposition that we're offering to top talent and to our players and we're looking at the amount being invested in training facilities, in stadiums, in compensation for players, we have to look at it in the context of where our business is at and of course, as I said earlier, we've made incredible strides in a very short period of time to drive commercial growth, both at the league level and our clubs, but that is the lens that we consistently look at it through.\"\nShould Rodman leave the NWSL, she would join a growing list of USWNT players who recently moved to Europe like Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma, though she would easily be the most high-profile to do so. The prospect of Rodman leaving for the Power is a unique one, though – like the NWSL, the USL Super League has been sanctioned by U.S. Soccer as a Division I league, but the clubs' means and budgets are generally more modest than the NWSL's. In its short history, it has acted more as a developmental tool for NWSL clubs, who have sent players on loan to counterparts in the USL Super League, rather than as a destination for top-tier players.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN JOSE -- The quest for the 2025 NWSL Championship enters its final day, the Washington Spirit face a pivotal question: Will soon-to-be free agent Trinity Rodman be fit to play?Spirit head coach Adrian Gonzalez offered the update fans have been waiting for: Rodman is \"going to be available and ready to compete.\"\"Trin is doing good. She's been, I think, improving so quick, pushing to be able to play,\" Gonzalez said. \"Fortunately, we could see her last week, playing some minutes, and she's doing great, so obviously she's going to be available and ready to compete.\"Rodman's season has been marred by injuries. A lingering back injury sidelined her for nearly four months and even sent her to Europe for treatment. Just 16 games after she returned, an MCL sprain kept her sidelined during the playoff push. She was bench-listed for both playoff games, making only a brief cameo in the final minute of Washington's semifinal win over Portland -- her first action in a month. Now, with the Spirit on the brink of a second NWSL Championship title in four years, her game-day availability could be the difference between glory and heartbreak.\nYou can catch the game Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.Rodman has dominated championship-week headlines -- not just because of her return from injury, but for what comes next. The 23-year-old enters the final game of the season as a potential free agent this offseason, with a report looming regarding a lucrative offer from USL Super League side D.C. Power, according to The Athletic. Her future has become a talking point across the league, has prompted commissioner Jessica Berman to emphasize that she and the league \"want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her.\" That backdrop adds even more intrigue to her availability for Saturday's must-watch title clash.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Rodman's return to the pitch this season has been anything but smooth, but the fact that Gonzalez declared her \"available and ready to compete\" is a significant upgrade, considering she was labeled as questionable entering the semifinal against Portland, where she subbed in as a late-game option and played a minute. \nWhile that's not a ringing endorsement of the ability to play lengthy minutes, it took Rodman one minute and four touches to record a definitive shot on goal. It shows again why she's such an important player, no matter the amount of time she can give to the Spirit in a high-stakes game like the NWSL Championship. Her availability isn't just a boost; it could be a potential game-changer.\n            ",

That leaves just three teams vying for two spots in the Dec. 6 ACC Championship in Charlotte: No. 19 Virginia, Pittsburgh and SMU.The problem in the playoff discussion? Only Virginia is ranked, while red-hot Group of Five squads Tulane (9-2) and James Madison (10-1) continue climbing in the committee's eyes. Both conference frontrunners won on Saturday and control their own destinies.Virginia will clinch a spot in the ACC title game with a win over Virginia Tech. SMU can get in with a win over Cal. Pittsburgh will reach Charlotte if it beats Miami and either Virginia or SMU loses.\nIn other words, the Hokies have become agents of chaos in the ACC. Even if Pitt or SMU wins the league, there's no guarantee either will be ranked ahead of the Group of Five champions two weeks from now.ACC standings after Week 13TeamRecordNext weekNo. 19 Virginia9-2, 6-1Virginia Tech (Win to reach ACC final)SMU8-3, 6-1at Cal (Win to reach ACC final)Pitt8-3, 6-1Miami (Win to reach ACC final with Virginia or SMU loss)No. 16 Georgia Tech9-1, 6-2N/ANo. 13 Miami9-2, 5-2at PittDuke 6-5, 5-2Wake ForestIf you're one of those crazies who roots for a conference in the playoff after your preferred team is excluded, here's what ACC fans need to hope happens over the next two weekends to all but guarantee entry: Virginia wins out and takes the ACC crown -- OR -- James Madison suffers an unexpected loss.Anything happening outside of those two possibilities leaves everything up to the committee, whose goal is to put the 12 \"best teams\" in the playoff and not the most deserving. And with the stipulation five of those bids are given as auto-conference champions, a potentially unranked winner of the ACC isn't going to have much of a say.\nKeep an eye on Tuesday night's rankings. Where SMU or Pittsburgh land in relation to various Group of Five options is extremely important moving forward.\n            \n    ",

With two of the best defenses in the league meeting in the final in Tulsa, chances came at a premium, but neither side were able to take them as they extended lengthy shutout streaks in the final. Tulsa keeper Tyler Deric guessed correctly on four of those Pittsburgh penalties, but was unable to save any of them, showing how fine margins can be in a game of this magnitude.Coaching only his seventh game for Pittsburgh after manager Bob Lilley was placed on administrative leave, interim manager Rob Vincent has hit cult level status in Pittsburgh by going undefeated in those matches. At 35, Vincent has also become the youngest coach ever to win the championship. Juan Guerra, who won with Phoenix Rising in 2023 at 36 years, eight months, and 37 days old, was the previous holder of the record that has now fallen.Lilley led the Riverhounds to a playoff spot in every season since he was hired in 2017, but he had never won a playoff game with the club, which rallied together under Vincent and were able to make something special happen.Pittsburgh's defense only allowed five of Tulsa's 17 shots to be on target during the match, and despite Pittsburgh only putting one shot on target, they did just enough. Even when it came to penalties, keeper Eric Dick was ready for anything that came his way as the Riverhounds won three penalty shootouts en route to winning the USL title.\nTulsa may be disappointed to not win in front of their home fans, but this is a club moving in the right direction. They were 10th in the Western Conference last season, and head coach Luke Spencer was able to lead the Scissortails within a shootout of the first league title in club history. They'll be back on this stage in what is a final of teams on the rise.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        SAN JOSE, CALIF. --  In a match an entire year in the making, it was a moment of brilliance that separated Gotham FC from Washington Spirit in the 2025 NWSL Championship final, thanks to veteran midfielder Rose Lavelle. The two teams have played each other more times (45) than any other team in NWSL history, surpassing the famed Pacific Northwest rivalry between the Portland Thorns and the Seattle Reign. In recent years, the matches have been more tightly contested, and with added meetings outside of the league during the 2025 Concacaf W Champions Cup, it was only natural that the 2025 NWSL Championship felt as cagey as it did at times. It took a moment of brilliance by Lavelle late in the game for Gotham to finally capitalize on the possession they happened to retain while the Spirit were trying to manage getting out of an injury scenario. Spirit midfielder Hal Hershfelt was getting treatment on the sidelines for several minutes, and eventually came back into the match, but Gotham fullback Brunihna took advantage of the wide spaces, and Lavelle handled the rest.\n\"I think it was like, maybe the one moment I had in the game to step up. And I keep saying I think Bruninha did the heavy lifting on that, but yeah, it was a great ball across the box, and luckily I was able to get there to finish. But yeah, it was fun,\" Lavelle said about her game-winning goal.\nThis is Gotham FC's second NWSL Championship title in the last three years, though they haven't made it easy on themselves. The club finished the 2025 regular season in eighth place, falling to the last available playoff spot. But Gotham FC had been in this scenario before in 2023 and were familiar with running a playoff gauntlet all the way to a podium finish. This is a first-time experience, though, for plenty of players in 2025, including Lavelle, who signed with the team in 2024 in a monster offseason for the club.\"I definitely wouldn't have thought, like three years ago, that I'd be on Gotham playing in a final. I wouldn't have anticipated that. But I think, nonetheless, it's been a really exciting, fun journey. Being a part of the New York-New Jersey sports market has been so fun and special. So having the opportunity to potentially bring another title back to the city would be really, really cool in terms of [my] career,\" Lavelle said in the days leading up to the NWSL Championship.Lavelle is one of the league's most familiar faces. A player whose singular talent has long been celebrated, a former No. 1 pick in the NWSL Draft, an event roster-building mechanism that no longer exists. She's played for four different clubs before turning 30, and at one point even had to be selected in a dispersal draft, because the former club that drafted her, the Boston Breakers, folded.\nNow, despite winning FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic gold medals, the long-time NWSL player was back in the NWSL Championship final, this time playing for the team that she lost against in 2023.\"I keep saying, I think we all know that we like underperformed, especially at the end of the season. I think that was not the end that we wanted to have. So, I think going into this season, like we just were so confident in the group that we had. We know we have a lot of talent, and so I think we really leaned on that this playoff series, and I think that's what we saw, and that's what ended up helping us win,\" Lavelle said after the match. The creative, quick-thinking, dribbling menace has often glided through plenty of midfield traffic. She often just needs a few touches to find the open lane or take the quick shot. She's produced on the biggest stages in her career, and yet, an NWSL Championship has eluded her. That's no longer the case, and the title win has an added sense of accomplishment due to its difficulty. \n\"I feel like this is like, this is like, what you play for. This season is like, so long and hard, but then you get to these moments, and it's like this is the fun part. It's win, lose, or go home. So, I think we're all just like, fighting for each other and amped up playing every single day. It's a heightened sense of excitement. I mean, technically, I like to think every game should be the same, and you go into every game feeling the same, but I definitely think the NWSL Playoffs is like a whole different beast.\"The NWSL postseason is a different beast. NWSL players often refer to it as a new season or series to get through. This postseason has put Lavelle in the spotlight again, especially whenever Gotham finds themselves in tricky game situations. Throughout the regular season and the playoffs, there have been times when their attack has stagnated, and the path to the goal seemed blocked. But it is in these moments that Lavelle's quality becomes most vital, and where she's found the most growth.\"Oh my gosh, I think it's just so special. I keep saying like this was such a roller coaster of a season for us. We had injuries, we had a really daunting schedule with the amount of games that we were playing. The travel. I think just like the way that every single individual stepped up in the moments that they were asked to was so huge,\" she said.\n\"And so, I think I would say, you learn the most about yourself in the toughest moments. I think the adversity that we faced throughout the season really helped set us up to be prepared for this playoff push. I think that, that's really what set us up to, like, win in the end. We went through a lot of the season, we had seen it all, so, I don't think anything felt like new or unfamiliar going into this. And I think that that was a really big advantage for us going into the playoffs.\"\n            ",

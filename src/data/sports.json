The team coached by Cristian Chivu, despite suffering and conceding two goals in the first half to Pisa, in the end managed to win 6-2 at San Siro on Friday, while both Napoli and AC Milan failed to win on Sunday. Antonio Conte's side faced another challenging match and lost 3-0 to Juventus in Turin, basically saying goodbye to their chances of winning the back-to-back Scudettos while AC Milan drew 1-1 against AS Roma. Despite avoiding defeat in their away match in Rome, AC Milan remain five points behind the Nerazzurri, but they could benefit in the coming weeks from the fact that Chivu's side are facing a crucial and demanding month in their Champions League campaign.Here's what to know:\nInter atop the standingsInter came out of the weekend as the leading candidates for the Scudetto and increased their gap on both AC Milan and Napoli. The side coached by Conte are now probably excluded from the chance of winning the Serie A title for the second season in a row, while Inter are now in the best position possible but will also likely have to face the Champions League playoffs next month, increasing the matches they will have to play in a key month for both Serie A and European campaigns. Chivu was able to rotate his team in the past weeks and some new faces emerged as crucial, starting with Italian young star Francesco Pio Esposito, who scored a key goal against Pisa and showed again to be an important player for Inter and potentially for Italy in the near future. The 18-year old was able to find his space in this team despite playing with some world-class stars such as Marcus Thuram, Lautaro Martinez and Yoan Bonny. Watch out for him. Napoli facing issuesConte is facing a difficult moment at Napoli, especially due to injuries. The Azzurri were not able to rotate as much as the Italian coach was hoping to and now Napoli are nine points behind Inter in the Serie A standings. That's a gap that will be difficult to overcome. The Italian manager was unhappy with the performance of the Azzurri that lost 3-0 in Turin against Juventus but also underlined once again how difficult the season is going. Conte was forced to play with new signing Giovane in the second half after the club decided to loan Noa Lang to Galatasaray and sold Lorenzo Lucca to Nottingham Forest. Speaking to DAZN after the match, Conte said, \"For the first time in my career, I had to play a player I had never even seen before. Now this has happened to me as well. I haven't trained him for even a single minute.\" Napoli will face Chelsea on Wednesday at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona live on Paramount+ in a key match that might also affect the future of the Italian coach as the Azzurri are at risk of being eliminated in the league phase.\nAS Roma help Chivu \nThe AS Roma draw against AC Milan helped Inter to increase their gap with the city rivals but also meant Gian Piero Gasperini's team are now in third place, tied on points with Napoli behind Inter and the Rossoneri. Week by week, AS Roma are improving, and new signing Robinio Vaz showed Gasperini's vision for this team in the long term -- young players who can adapt to his attacking style, something his team probably lacked during the opening months of his stint in Rome. It's too early to understand the impact of the new signing, but even if he only played a few minutes, he looks way more tactically involved than other attacking players that are set to leave the team in the summer, such as Artem Dovbyk or Evan Ferguson. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos' season ended just short of reaching Super Bowl LX after falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. This was the latest gut punch for a franchise that limped into this conference title matchup. The high of winning a divisional round thriller against the Buffalo Bills in overtime was almost instantly shattered once word got out that Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury. That thrust backup Jarrett Stidham into the limelight, and while the veteran had his moments, he couldn't get his team to pull off what would've been a miraculous upset. Now, Sean Payton's club is looking into the abyss of the offseason and on the precipice of doing a postmortem of the 2025 season. By most accounts, it was a wildly successful campaign, owning a 14-3 record over the regular season, which was good enough for an NFC West title and the No. 1 seed. As they look to begin preparing for the 2026 season, let's highlight what's on the horizon for the organization. Bo Nix's recovery takes center stage\nNix suffered a broken right ankle in the final moments of that overtime win against the Bills. The second-year quarterback has already undergone surgery to repair the ankle, with the procedure done this week. The early prognosis was that Nix is expected to be sidelined for 12 weeks. If he stays on that recovery timeline, Nix should only miss a small amount of OTAs (if any) and certainly be on track to participate during mandatory minicamp later this spring. That gives Nix plenty of time to get into form before Denver opens up training camp, so this injury is not debilitating enough that it'll bleed into 2026. Does the coaching staff lose key figures?Payton has been able to bring the Broncos back to relevance, but that success may soon result in key figures on his coaching staff being poached. With Denver now eliminated, teams looking for a head coach can now hold in-person interviews with Broncos staffers, including defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and offensive pass game coordinator Davis Webb. Both Joseph and Webb have been popular candidates this hiring cycle, and it would not be shocking to see one or both coaches depart in short order. \nWebb has interest from the Las Vegas Raiders and Buffalo Bills, and neither of those destinations has filled their vacancy to this point. Webb also interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, but the franchise recently hired former Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. While Payton calls the offensive plays, having someone of Webb's acumen departing is hardly ideal for a still-developing offense under Nix. As for Joseph, he has been requested by a large contingent of teams. While some of those organizations have since filled their roles, the Raiders and Arizona Cardinals are two clubs that have expressed interest in Joseph and are still on the hunt for a new coach. Joseph's potential exit could prove to be the biggest X factor of Denver's offseason. A big piece as to why the Broncos made it to the AFC Championship was due to Joseph orchestrating arguably the best defense in the NFL. Denver was fourth in the NFL in scoring and first in the NFL in sacks (including postseason). If Joseph leaves, there's the risk that the unit takes a slight step back. \nBolstering offense around NixA couple of the areas the Broncos should look to address this offseason come on the offensive side of the ball. Specifically, they need to continue surrounding Nix with talent at the skill positions. This season, the Broncos ranked 28th in the NFL in yards per reception from the wide receiver and tight end positions combined. Courtland Sutton was able to lead the team with 1,017 yards receiving, but Denver did struggle to find a top secondary pass-catching option, volleying from Troy Franklin to Pat Bryant to Marvin Mims at receiver. They also never truly got Evan Engram off the ground as Payton's \"Joker\" at the tight end spot. \nMoreover, Denver need to bolster the backfield. The rushing attack cratered after J.K. Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10. Rookie RJ Harvey averaged just 3.7 yards per carry on the year. Their inability to run the football effectively came back to bite them in the AFC Championship, where they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush as a team. With a backup quarterback under center and snowy conditions late in the contest, a capable ground attack could've helped them pull off the upset. Instead, that deficiency helped be their undoing. With Dobbins looking at free agency this offseason, along with a shaky injury history, Denver would be wise to add a back in some capacity this offseason. Offseason assets, free agentsNotable free agents:DL John Franklin-MyersLB Alex SingletonRB J.K. DobbinsS P.J. LockeJa'Quan McMillan (restricted)The Broncos are projected to have roughly $35.4 million in available salary cap space, which is the 12th highest in the NFL.  As for the NFL Draft, Denver has five picks inside the first four rounds, including their own first-round pick.\n            ",

The combined points are the second-lowest total in AFC title game history (Dolphins 14-0 over Jets in 1982).The Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl for an NFL-record 12th time, and to get there, Drake Maye did something that Tom Brady never did: He won a playoff game in Denver. Brady went 0-3 in his career in the Mile High city with two of those losses coming in an AFC title game. With New England's win, that means the Super Bowl will now be a rematch with the Patriots either facing a Seahawks team that they faced in Super Bowl XLIX or a Rams team that they've faced twice before in the Super Bowl. In the NFC title game, the Rams will be heading to Seattle to face the Seahawks for the third time this season. The teams split their two regular-season meetings with the Rams winning in Week 11 (21-19) and the Seahawks winning in Week 16 (38-37). The Seahawks earned their way to the NFC Championship by absolutely destroying the 49ers 41-6. The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's AFC, NFC Championship picks: Jarrett Stidham does enough for Broncos, Seahawks lean on defense\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25AFC Championship(2) Patriots 10-7 over (1) Broncos. This was a dominant performance by a New England defense that has now played three straight dominant games in the playoffs. The Broncos scored on their second possession of the game, but after that, the Patriots' defense shut Denver down. The biggest play of the game came in the second quarter when the Patriots forced a Jarrett Stidham fumble that New England recovered at Denver's 12-yard line. Drake Maye scored on a 6-yard run just two plays later to provide the Patriots' only touchdown of the game. Maye didn't put up huge numbers, but he came up big with his legs: Not only did he score, but he also iced the win with a 7-yard run on third-and-5 with under two minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. NFC ChampionshipRams at Seahawks, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8Patriots vs. Rams/Seahawks at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Divisional Round resultsSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) Steelers\nTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        As players were being introduced ahead of Unrivaled action on Sunday, three-time WNBA champion Breanna Stewart held up a sign that said \"Abolish ICE,\" when her name was called. Stewart's action comes in the wake of federal immigration officers killing a 37-year-old man, Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis on Saturday. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking protests across the city, and other across the country, calling for ICE to be abolished.After the game on Sunday, Stewart expanded on her decision to hold up the sign.\"Really all day yesterday, I was just disgusted from everything that you see on Instagram and in the news,\" Stewart said. \"Everyone here [at Unrivaled] is feeling that way, one way or another. We're so fueled by hate right now instead of love, so I wanted to have a simple message of 'Abolish ICE,' which means having policies to uplift families and communities instead of fueling fear and violence.\"Stewart also shared her personal connection to this specific issue, as her wife, Marta Xargay Casademont, is not a U.S. citizen as she's from Spain.\n\"It's scary,\" Stewart said. \"You see it on social media, you see it splitting up families and dissecting communities and kids are being involved. It's the worst in all ways. And to be married to Marta ... we're working to get her citizenship, and she is a legal permanent resident and all of that. But it seems like it doesn't matter. And I think that that's why these policies need to be put in place, that reform needs to happen, because it doesn't seem to be affecting the right people. It's not helping anybody.\"Unrivaled held a moment of silence before Saturday's games, with the public address announcer saying, \"Our thoughts and support are with everyone affected, and we send our deepest sympathies to those who have lost a loved one.\"While Stewart has made the most public statement on ICE and the recent tragedies happening in Minneapolis, she isn't the only member of Unrivaled or the WNBA to share the same sentiments. Minnesota native and 2025 No. 1 overall pick Paige Bueckers pledged to match the $50,000 she won in Unrivaled's free-throw challenge to donate to the Hopkins Strong Relief Fund, which aids with food security in Minnesota.\nWNBPA executive committee member Brianna Turner took to social media to share similar sentiments about ICE.\"My thoughts are constantly with the [Minnesota] residents who are suffering through a politically motivated ICE invasion,\" Turner wrote on social media. \"There is nothing positive about improperly trained federal agents profiling individuals & antagonizing communities. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere.\"WNBA players are no stranger to speaking up on matters like these. In 2020, they were at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement amongst athletes. This has been no different.\n\"I think doing whatever you can to help your community [is important],\" Stewart said. \"Obviously, Minnesota is the place that everyone's seeing is in crisis, but it's happening in many more cities than just one, and knowing the right people to reach out to -- your local council person, your mayor, your governor -- and really advocating to change the policies and advocating for reform, knowing that it's not going to happen overnight.Stewart continued.\"But how many times do we have to see it happen over and over and over again and using our platform to make sure that we're trying to make a change and a difference and hopefully save a life.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Scottie Scheffler on Sunday earned his 20th victory on the PGA Tour in just his 151st career start. The world No. 1 looked the part in his season debut, overcoming a one-stroke deficit to Si Woo Kim at the 54-hole mark to enter the winner's circle at the 2026 American Express.Scheffler signed for a final-round 66 at Pete Dye's Stadium Course, running away from the field. Reaching 27 under for the tournament, Scheffler's margin of victory stood at four strokes over Jason Day, Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, the latter of whom posed as his closest pursuer for much of the back nine on Sunday.The win represents plenty in the context of Scheffler's career. It is the earliest in the calendar year that he has won on the PGA Tour. It is also his seven win in his last 13 starts as he won six of the last 12 tournaments he played on the PGA Tour in 2025.With the victory, Scheffler becomes the first player since Rory McIlroy at the 2021 CJ CUP to win 20 times on the PGA Tour; he's the 40th in history to accomplish the feat.\nWinning 20 times in 151 starts, Scheffler trails only Tiger Woods (95) and Jack Nicklaus (127) as the third-quickest ever to the key number. Scheffler also joins Woods and Nicklaus as the only players to emerge victorious in 20 PGA Tour events and four major championships before the age of 30. Despite a nine-win campaign in 2024 that included seven PGA Tour victories, an Olympic gold medal and a successful defense at the Hero World Challenge -- and a 2025 in which he won two major championships despite not raising a trophy until May amid an offseason hand injury -- Scheffler appears primed to challenge if not surpass those efforts just 72 holes into his 2026 season.One day after Scheffler struggled with his scoring clubs, he let the field know that he had righted those wrongs on the opening hole. Throwing a dart to 4 feet on the par-4 1st, he caught Kim immediately and never looked back. Scheffler kicked in four birdies from inside 5 feet across his first seven holes and added another from 10 feet before making the turn.\nThe same story continued to unravel on the inward half as Scheffler imposed his will. A birdie from 2 feet came on No. 11, another from 2 feet on the next and a driven wedge to a back pin location on No. 14 led to another conversion from 4 feet. As the back nine progressed, it was no longer a question of whether Scheffler would win but rather how deep his margin would grow. As the year progresses, the question may turn from wondering which tournaments Scheffler will win to which he will not. Grade: A+\nT2. Ryan Gerard (-23): Fresh off a runner-up finish at the Sony Open, Gerard kept his foot on the gas on the mainland. Stretching back to his start in Mauritius last fall on the DP World Tour, he now has three straight runner-up results. The confidence is continuing to snowball as the game makes one leap after another. While the bread and butter of his game is typically his ball striking, Gerard found success this week on and around the greens. He will win again this season, and it will likely come sooner than later. Grade: A\nT6. Si Woo Kim (-22): The four-time PGA Tour winner looked up to the task in the early stages of the final round; Kim gave himself birdie chance after birdie chance on his front nine. He was well within range of Scheffler before disaster struck on the par-5 8th, where he made a mess around the green and made a double bogey without losing a golf ball. Some interesting decisions and the inability to cash in early chances proved to be Kim's downfall, but this week proved that, when he putts well, he will position his name on the first page of the leaderboard given his current ball-striking acumen. Grade: B+T18. Blades Brown (-19): Facing an opportunity to become the second-youngest winner on the PGA Tour, Brown acquitted himself nicely in the final group alongside Scheffler and Kim. He made an early birdie and appeared comfortable but made a fatal mistake when he found the water off the tee on the par-5 5th, leading to a double bogey. The 18-year-old was never able to recover from there, but the experience will prove beneficial as he continues to progress in his career. He battled tough but was unable to remain inside the top 10 and earn a spot in next week's Farmers Insurance Open. Grade: A+T18. Will Zalatoris (-19): In his first PGA Tour start since last spring's PGA Championship, Zalatoris jumped out of the gate with a 7-under 65. The wiry right-hander continued to show promise in ball-striking areas, but in a tournament that requires piling up birdies, he was ultimately left in the dust ahead of his sizzling 64 on Sunday. There are a lot of positive signs to take from the week, as he was among the leaders in greens in regulation and strokes gained tee to green. That's a recipe for success and one which Zalatoris has mastered throughout his career. \n\"Really good besides a couple holes on the Nicklaus Course,\" Zalatoris said. \"I putted really well, been working with Blair Phillips at home. It's been a massive change taking ownership on the putting green, and I think, this year, you're going to see a massive difference in my putting this year in general. Yeah, it's nice to, any 64 on Sunday feels pretty good, especially after the last three years I've been through.\" Grade: BT18. Rickie Fowler (-19): Fowler quietly entered 2026 with a ton of momentum following his run in last season's FedEx Cup Playoffs. Despite tinkering with his bag configuration and putting a new putter in place, the fan favorite did not miss a beat. After carding three bogeys at La Quinta Country Club on Thursday, Fowler played his final 54 holes in bogey-free fashion, including no squares on his scorecard across his two rounds at the more difficult Stadium Course. He may have some work to convert more scoring chances, but any time clean cards stack up, that's a good thing. Grade: B-\n            ",

Now, he can etch his name even deeper into Lombardi Trophy history: With a win in Super Bowl LX, Vrabel would become the first person ever to win a Super Bowl as a player and as a head coach for the same franchise.When informed of that select company by CBS Sports' Jim Nantz postgame, Vrabel quickly deflected the praise.\"I won't win it,\" Vrabel said during the trophy ceremony. \"It'll be the players that'll win the game. I promise you. It won't be me that'll win it, and I promise I'll do everything that I can to, and our staff, to have them ready for the game.\"Vrabel has already joined exclusive company as only the second person to make the Super Bowl as a player and as a head coach for the same team. Gary Kubiak also did it with, coincidentally, the Broncos: He was a Denver quarterback on their Super Bowl XXI (1986 season), Super Bowl XXII (1987 season) and Super Bowl XXIV (1989 season) teams -- all losses -- and the coach for its Super Bowl 50 (2015 season) triumph.\nVrabel's trips to the Super Bowl as a player were much more successful: triumphs in Super Bowl XXXVI (2001 season), Super Bowl XXXVIII (2003 season) and Super Bowl XXXIX (2004 season) and a loss in Super Bowl XLII (2007 season).Though he was a linebacker, he might be best known for his contributions as a pass catcher: He caught touchdown passes in two different Super Bowls and finished his career with 12 catches, all of which went for touchdowns.\nVrabel is one of 105 people to play in and be a head coach in the NFL since the 1970 merger, and he's one of the most successful when also considering his time coaching the Tennessee Titans. New England is the first team to make the Super Bowl one year after a 13-loss season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Vanderbilt suffered its first loss of the season at the hands of South Carolina on Sunday afternoon, with the No. 2 Gamecocks dominating the No. 5 Commodores, 103-74.Vanderbilt came into the game 20-0, which was the best start in program history, and the Commodores were one of the last two undefeated teams remaining in women's college basketball. The only one still standing is No. 1 UConn, the reigning national champions.\"We have won 20 games,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph told reporters postgame. \"We're 20-1. The world is not ending. We are going to be fine.\"\nFive Gamecocks scored in double figures, led by Ta'Niya Latson and Tessa Johnson, who combined for 41 points. Mikayla Blakes led Vanderbilt's effort with 23 points, which marked her 16th 20+ point game of the season.\nSouth Carolina was bouncing back from a 94-82 overtime loss to Oklahoma earlier in the week. Dawn Staley's program has not lost back-to-back games since the 2018-19 season and Sunday's result helped the Gamecocks keep that streak going. They moved the ball well with 25 assists, more than double the 12 they had in the loss to the Sooners. The Gamecocks were able to speed up Vanderbilt, which helped them get 24 points off 16 turnovers in the first half. This put the Commodores in an unusual situation since they entered the game only averaging 12.5 turnovers per game. Vanderbilt finished the game with 20 turnovers that led to 32 South Carolina points.\nSouth Carolina held a 55-44 lead at the break, with 28 of those points coming from the paint. By the end of the night, the Gamecocks had won the battle in the paint 56-24. However, their shots were also working from elsewhere as they had 10 3-pointers, which is more than their 5.9 per game average this season.\nRalph said she was surprised by her team's poor defensive performance, which she described as an \"absolute disaster.\" Mental strength and staying locked in even when they are down is also something the coach wants to see from her team as they move forward.\"At points in the game it looked like we quit,\" she said. \"That can't be who we are.\"This was the Gamecocks' 5th win against a ranked opponent this season, while Vanderbilt has two. Both teams still have plenty of time to add more quality wins before March because the SEC is impressively deep with nine teams ranked in the AP Top 25 this week.\nUp next, South Carolina will hit the road to take on Auburn on Thursday. That same night, Vanderbilt will have a chance to bounce back with a road matchup against No. 18 Ole Miss.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots tied an NFL playoff record on Sunday when they sent out Andres Borregales for a long field goal attempt just before halftime of the AFC Championship Game in Denver. With one second left to play in the second quarter and the Patriots sitting at Denver's 45-yard line, coach Mike Vrabel had two options: he could send out Drake Maye for a Hail Mary, or he could send out Borregales for a long kick. Vrabel ended up going for the 63-yard field goal, which was notable, because it tied the NFL record for longest field goal attempt in a playoff game. Going into Sunday, there had only been TWO attempts of 60 yards or longer in NFL postseason history. Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein attempted a 63-yarder against the Cowboys during a 2018 divisional round game (he missed).49ers kicker Mike Cofer attempted a 60-yarder against the Vikings during a 1989 divisional round game (he missed).Not only did the Patriots tie the record for longest field goal attempt, but Borregales could have set the NFL record for longest field goal, but he ended up sending his kick wide left. \nBorregales, who was a sixth-round pick for the Patriots in the 2025 NFL Draft, had a strong rookie year, and he was 4 of 4 during the regular season on kicks of 50 yards or longer. Trying a long kick in Denver definitely makes some sense, because some of the longest kicks in NFL history have been hit there. Of the 16 field goals of 63 yards or longer in NFL history, three of them have come in Denver. Although 60-yard field goals seem to happen every other week now, there still has NEVER been one in the NFL postseason. During the 2025 season, there were six kicks of 60 yards or longer, including an NFL record 67-yard field goal by Cam Little, but that hasn't translated to success in the playoffs. The longest kick in NFL postseason history is 58 yards, which has been done just twice. The Dolphins' Pete Stoyanovich set the record with a 58-yarder during a 17-16 win over the Chiefs in the 1990 wild card round. The Panthers' Graham Gano tied that mark in a 31-26 wild card loss to the Saints that was played back in January 2019. \nBorregales did hit a 23-yard field goal in the third quarter to give the Patriots a 10-7 lead. With a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line, we have a tight game in Denver. If you want to know the latest scores and stats, be sure to check out our live blog here. \n            ",

The Seahawks blasted the Niners, 41-6, in a game that was never remotely close after Rashid Shaheed took the opening kickoff to the house for a touchdown. The Seahawks are now in the conference title game for the first time since 2014, when they went to back-to-back Super Bowls during the \"Legion of Boom\" era.Los Angeles is coming off a dramatic, overtime victory over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round, which followed a similarly dramatic win over the Carolina Panthers on Wild Card Weekend. The Rams have won their two playoff games by a combined six points, but they've advanced to the title game nonetheless. They were last here back in the 2021 season, when Matthew Stafford led the team to its first Super Bowl since 1999, and now they're looking to get back to the same mountaintop.\n        \n            \n                Seahawks vs. Rams: NFC Championship expert picks, odds, NFL playoffs best bets, where to watch, TV, stream\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will advance to the Super Bowl and earn a chance to compete for the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough. Before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Seahawks vs. Rams liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field (Seattle)TV: Fox | Streaming: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 46.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesGrudge match. The Rams beat the Seahawks in the first of the teams' two regular-season meetings, prevailing 21-19, a game in which their defense forced four interceptions from Sam Darnold. The Seahawks won the second game in dramatic fashion in overtime, converting a pair of two-point tries along the way as they stormed back from a 30-14 fourth-quarter deficit and got themselves the inside track to the No. 1 seed that allows them to host this conference title game. Sam Darnold vs. Chris Shula. Darnold had a miserable time against Shula's defense in the playoffs last year and in the first matchup of this season. He went 25 of 40 for 245 yards, one touchdown and one interception while taking an incredible nine sacks in last year's playoff game. He went 29 of 44 for 279 yards and the aforementioned four picks in the first matchup this season. And in the first three quarters of the second matchup this season, he went 10 of 16 for 126 yards and another pick. But he went off in the fourth quarter and overtime of that second game, completing 12 of 18 passes for 144 yards, two scores and a pick (and the game-winning two-point conversion in OT) to lead the team back from its 16-point deficit. The Seahawks need more of the latter version of Darnold than the former if they want to stave off the Rams again. The Rams' secondary can be leaky on occasion, so it's likely a matter of keeping Darnold well protected, giving him time to make the right decisions rather than rushing and becoming more susceptible to mistakes.Matthew Stafford vs. Mike Macdonald. Stafford largely struggled in the first matchup between these two teams this season, going just 15 of 28 for 130 yards (a season-low average of 4.6 per attempt), albeit while throwing a pair of touchdowns and no picks. But he went nuclear in the second matchup, throwing for 457 yards and three scores while completing 29 of 49 pass attempts. He didn't take a sack or turn the ball over in either game. With Puka Nacua and Davante Adams on the outside, he has the tools to succeed against even one of the best defenses in the NFL, which is exactly what the Seahawks are. If Macdonald can contain Stafford as he did in the first matchup, the Seahawks have a chance to win -- even if that's not what happened in that particular game. But if Stafford goes off again as he did in the second matchup, the Seahawks might not get the miracle comeback this time around. Zach Charbonnet injury. The Seahawks will be down a man in the backfield after Charbonnet tore his ACL last week against San Francisco. That leaves Kenneth Walker III as the feature back for Seattle. George Holani could potentially return from injured reserve, but if he doesn't, then it'll be Velus Jones Jr. and Cam Akers working behind Walker. That would likely mean a significant workload for Walker, who has been splitting the snaps and touches with Charbonnet all season. Charbonnet has been the preferred goalline back for Seattle, so it'll be interesting to see whether Walker assumes that role or if it goes to one of the other backs active for the game.Rams running game. Kyren Williams carried the ball 12 times for 91 yards and a touchdown in the first matchup between these two teams. Blake Corum, though, got only 10 yards on his 8 carries. Still, 20 rushes for 101 yards is excellent. Williams and Corum combined for 118 yards on 37 rushing attempts in the second game, though, getting bottled up a little bit more than they did in the first contest. have run for at least 111 yards in each of their two playoff games, but Williams and Corum averaging a combined 4.0 yards per carry, which probably won't cut it against an elite Seattle run defense that held enemy backs to 3.7 yards a pop during the regular season.PredictionI picked the Rams to beat the Seahawks in the NFC title game in our pre-playoff predictions, so I am obviously rolling with the same pick here. L.A. won the first game between these two teams and should have won the second one, and would have if not for one of the craziest two-point conversions anyone has ever seen. The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position. In this case, that's Matthew Stafford and the Rams. I like them to advance with a closely contested win. \nPick: Rams 23, Seahawks 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams, with just one total touchdown allowed over this stretch. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The Seahawks enter conference championship weekend as the Super Bowl favorites looking to win their second championship in franchise history. The first one came thanks to a stunning 43-8 thrashing of Peyton Manning and the Broncos' record-setting offense in Super Bowl XLVIII.If the Seahawks are going to repeat what they did a dozen years ago, it will be with the same formula: the occasional explosive pass with a punishing ground game backed by the NFL's top scoring defense. It worked for Russell Wilson (in his second season), Marshawn Lynch and the \"Legion of Boom\" and it could work with Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the \"Dark Side,\" which is Seattle's new self-ordained defensive nickname. The moniker could be a Nirvana track, but the defensive players chose the name because of the Pacific Northwest's gloomy weather during the fall and winter months of the season. Its defense was indeed so suffocating it earned Seattle the NFL's top scoring defense crown for the first time since the \"Legion of Boom\" did it a decade ago. Nasty defense has gotten Seattle this far. The Seahawks have allowed one touchdown in the last month. Their next challenge is the toughest: stop Sean McVay's No. 1 scoring offense and the possible MVP quarterback, Matthew Stafford, five weeks after they scored 37 on you in your building. If anyone can make the necessary adjustments to counter what happened in Week 16, it's Mike Macdonald's defense.To understand where this new defense can take them, you have to understand where it came from and how Seattle is looking to ride a new No. 1 group to a Super Bowl while evolving from the \"Legion of Boom\" glory days to the \"Dark Side\".\n\"Legion of Boom\" fall paved way for the \"Dark Side\"Richard Sherman, left, and Earl Thomas were two of the best defensive backs of their generation.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            It's hard to talk about an elite defense in Seattle without waxing poetic about another Seahawks defense that used to give teams nightmares. The \"Legion of Boom\" went on one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history over a decade ago. They became the first team to lead the NFL in scoring defense for four straight seasons since the Cleveland Browns in the 1950s. They were debated as one of the best championship defenses of all-time alongside the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2002 Buccaneers for good reason. They pulled off one of the most incredible defensive feats in league history by holding the Broncos to eight points in the Super Bowl after Denver had scored an NFL-record 606 points during the regular season and Peyton Manning threw for 5,477 yards and 55 touchdowns. All three records still stand today, even with a 17th game. One memory from this defense lives on. Richard Sherman's interview with Erin Andrews after making a deflection that was intercepted by future Super Bowl MVP Malcolm Smith to win the 2013 NFC Championship vs. the 49ers is immortal and stamped the Legion of Boom as the the defining force of their generation of football. \nThe \"LOB\" was a brand of big personalities, big hits (jumbo safety Kam Chancellor used to rock people) and playmaking (Earl Thomas' chase-down forced fumbles) that took over the NFL in a flash and it went away in the blink of an eye. Injuries, old age and contracts (they had to pay Russell Wilson) all caught up the league's most feared defense too fast. Sherman (torn Achilles), Thomas (broken leg) and Chancellor (neck) all suffered season-ending (or career ending in Chancellor's case) injuries that more or less ended their time in Seattle by 2018. It's a crime none of the trio played with the Seahawks into their thirties. Michael Bennett was also traded, Cliff Avril suffered a career-ending neck injury and poof, it was over.Mike Macdonald hired to be McVay and Shanahan's kryptoniteThe downfall of the LOB and the lessons learned led us to the next generation of defensive brilliance. \nAfter all, the Seahawks had one of the worst defenses in the NFL in the post-LOB days where Pete Carroll and Wilson won enough track meets to stay relevant but only managed one playoff win. A new wave of offensive gurus came into the division between Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay around the same time Seattle's defense began fading in 2017. Motion, jet sweeps, misdirection and deception became common NFL vernacular as Shanahan, McVay and Matt LaFleur's teams combined to score 99 points while eliminating the Seahawks in three playoff runs in 2019, 2020 and 2022. That made things crystal clear. A reset was needed. The counter move was to make then 36-year old Mike Macdonald the youngest head coach in the NFL after he led the 2023 Ravens to the title of top scoring defense as coordinator. Macdonald has proved to be exactly what the Seahawks needed as a great leader and communicator to usher in another winning culture while figuring out how to stop the NFC's best offenses. Seahawks general manager John Schneider said it best when he introduced Macdonald in 2024. \"This is the future right here, this is where it's going … I think you're going to learn in getting to know Mike that he's a special dude.\" \nHe was right. Macdonald's reputation from Baltimore has followed him to Seattle. The 2023 Ravens became the first team in NFL history to lead the league in scoring defense, takeaways and sacks in the same season, which was Macdonald's last with the club. Fast forward just two years and he's already rebuilt the Seahawks from the No. 25 unit in 2023 to the top defense in 2025.He's only the third coach since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger to be the defensive coordinator and head coach of a top scoring defense after pulling it off with the Ravens and Seahawks. The other two were Rex Ryan and Bill Belichick. Macdonald's own innovative thinking has already helped neutralize two of the best thinkers on the other side of the ball. The Rams and 49ers are averaging under 21 points per game in nine games vs. the Seahawks under Macdonald. Fittingly, Macdonald has a chance to get Seattle to the Super Bowl by going through the two coaches he was hired to beat. What a flex that would be.\nSchneider rebuilt the entire defense in four yearsThe Seahawks slowly pieced together the talent to fit Macdonald's scheme predicated on a dominant front four backed by a physical and versatile group of linebackers and defensive backs. Schneider built the unit through equal parts draft, free agency and trade. There's not a single defender in the group with an active tenure on the team longer than four years. It's been a complete rebuild that has this new core standing shoulder to shoulder with the LOB.Seahawks defense then and nowSuper Bowl XLVIII vs BroncosWeek 18, 2025 vs 49ersDECliff AvrilDemarcus LawrenceDTMichael BennettByron Murphy IIDTClint McDonaldLeonard WilliamsDEChris ClemonsUchenna NwosuLBKJ WrightDrake ThomasLBBobby WagnerErnest Jones IVCBRichard ShermanDevon WitherspoonCBByron MaxwellJosh JobeCBWalter ThurmondNick EmmanworiSEarl ThomasJulian LoveSKam ChancellorCoby BryantThe Seahawks have had an absurd hit rate in the draft in the last four years. 2022: It started with a masterclass in 2022. Boye Mafe, Coby Bryant and Riq Woolen -- all key players in this defense. 2023: Schneider hit the jackpot with All-Pro corner Devon Witherspoon in the first round in 2023. He's since become the third defensive back in the past 40 years to make a Pro Bowl in each of his first three years along with Charles Woodson and Patrick Peterson. Macdonald credits Witherspoon's development for freeing him up as a defensive play caller. 2024: Seattle drafted defensive tackle Byron Murphy in the first round the following year and he's been a game-wrecker on the inside. 2025: The final piece to bring the top defense together was 2025 first-round pick Nick Emmanwori, a swiss-army knife who has done everything from defending the run to blitzing and excelling in coverage.  So the top defensive player Seattle took in each of the last four drafts was Mafe, Witherspoon, Murphy and Emmanwori. Holy crap. The Seahawks have also signed or traded for four players that got a Pro Bowl or All-Pro selection in the last few seasons2023: Seattle signed former Giants safety Julian Love to an affordable three-year deal worth $33 million. He's one of many versatile, hard-hitting defensive backs on the team. Seattle traded a second and fifth-round pick for Leonard Williams, who has lined up (and dominated) everywhere on the front four2024: The Seahawks got another steal when they traded Jerome Baker and a fourth-round pick for linebacker Ernest Jones IV, who was a second-team All-Pro selection this season. He became the first linebacker with 125+ tackles and at least five interceptions in a season since LaVonte David in 2013. Macdonald praised him during before last week's win, \"to really man the middle of the defense, especially with how much split safety we play, that's a tall task, but he's nailed it.\"2025: The final piece on the Seahawks dominant front four was Demarcus Lawrence, signed to a three-year deal after an injury-plagued final year in DallasThey may not have a treasure trove of superstars or future Hall of Famers like the \"Legion of Boom\" just yet, but don't be surprised if a couple of them leave their mark and have a significant playoff moment on their way to a Super Bowl.How quickly Seattle built its new elite defenseAcquiredWhenDE Demarcus LawrenceFree agent2025DT Byron MurphyDraft2024DT Leonard WilliamsTrade2023DE Uchenna NwosuFree agent2022LB Drake ThomasFree agent2023LB Ernest Jones IVTrade2024CB Devon WitherspoonDraft2023CB Josh JobeFree agent2024CB Nick EmmanworiDraft2025FS Coby BryantDraft2022SS Julian LoveFree agent2023Fear the Seahawks' \"Dark Side\"Seattle's defense hasn't been together long, but it quickly has merged into the NFL's best.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Now you know the names, but you might not have caught on with the name. This isn't the \"Legion of Boom 2.0.\" This is a phoenix rising from the ashes of the \"LOB\" with a new identity. The old was one of the best secondaries in NFL history. The new is a ferocious front four with studs at all three levels. Leonard Williams explained the origin recently. \"We always hear of Legion of Boom,\" he said. \"We were starting to get to a point like. 'Hey, maybe we deserve our own name, you know?' I think guys started coming up with names and stuff like that and I think Dark Side kind of stuck with us.\"But what does it mean?\"The Dark Side is our defense. DLaw (Demarcus Lawrence) said it good at one point, he wants to turn the offense's lights off. We've shut offenses down with no touchdowns, no points at times, I think that's what it feels like when the \"Dark Side\" is playing against you, it's hard to get the ball moving, it feels like cutting your lights off, it feels like you're playing against 12 people.\"12 as 112 as 1 is one of Macdonald's core defensive principles that goes beyond just playing in front of the \"12\", as in Seattle's 12th Man, which the Seahawks will be doing on Sunday.\"A lot of times we see the ball carrier on the ground and pause the film to see how many blue helmets are in the picture,\" Williams said. \"A majority of the time it's nine players standing over the ball carrier ... over time that's overwhelming and intimidating to offenses. When the offensive guy is getting off the ground and seeing 10 Seahawks around him, after a while and getting hit by so many of us, getting swarmed by so many of us, it starts to feel like there's more than 11 of us on the field.\"A rewatch of the Seahawks demolition of the 49ers in their last two games underscored that assessment. The 49ers were seemingly immediately on their backs as soon as they caught the ball. They had just eight missed tackles across those two games. In Week 18, the 49ers managed their third-worst yards after catch average (2.6) in nine years under Shanahan. \"All 11 guys make it feel like 12 to the football,\" Witherspoon said. \"We play with relentless energy and swag.\" Seattle's defensive ranks this seasonNFL RankPPG17.21stDef EPA/gm7.81stPts/drive1.481stYards/rush3.71stYards/att5.52ndThird down conv pct32%1stFront fourPersonnel-wise, the foundation of this special group is the front four. \"We wouldn't be here without how our defensive line has played,\" Macdonald said before the playoffs opened. Everything starts with them.The Seahawks allowed the fewest yards per rush in the NFL this year (3.7). They also got pressure at the sixth-highest rate in the league while blitzing at the seventh-lowest rate in the NFL. It's a similar formula that won Philadelphia the Super Bowl last year. You can put these four on an island and they can stop the run and create enough pressure without blitzing to help the secondary. Williams explained it like this, \"When we can play with two high safety and stop the run with just four down lineman, knowing at least two or three of us are getting double teams, that's mean we're not only stopping the double teams, we're beating the double teams, (Byron) Murphy is one of the best in the league that I've seen do it in my career.\"Williams and Murphy bring so much pressure and throw enough weight around to start a Beastquake 2.0. They have the most pressures (108), quarterback hits (35) and sacks (14.0) among any 300-pound duo this season.Versatility and controlled aggressionThe front four sets the tone and the versatility on all three levels brings it all together. Williams (defensive end, defensive tackle), Witherspoon (outside corner, slot corner) and Emmanwori (slot corner, linebacker) almost all split their playing time 50/50 at two positions. Rookie playmaker Nick Emmanwori is a Kyle Hamilton clone. The numbers between Hamilton and Emmanwori on Macdonald's top-scoring defenses are almost identical. 2023 Hamilton (BAL)2025 EmmanworiTackles8181Tackles for loss109QB hits44Passes defended1311Hamilton wears a ton of hats in Baltimore from box safety, to slot corner and deep safety and Emmanwori has been a major disruptor on Seattle's defense in a similar way. He has the fifth-most snaps played in the box among DBs (364). He's the chess piece that marries together an elite run defense with blanket coverage. The Seahawks are the first team since the 2015 Super Bowl-champion Broncos to rank top two in both yards per rush and yards per pass attempt allowed.It's an incredible feat, especially on the ground, considering since they play the least amount of base defense in the NFL and play among the most shell coverage.\"Some of the things you're going to ask Nick to do are a little different than what you'd ask a linebacker to do. But, in terms of how you manage your roster, he's basically playing the linebacker position,\" Macdonald said this week. \"We've essentially turned into a base 43 team with a crazy athletic SAM (linebacker), is what we are.\"The rookie was making highlights all over the field in Week 18 at San Francisco. \nHis presence was not lost on 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak, who gave him his flowers the week leading up to their playoff matchup.  \"That's their personnel, that's what they want to do, and they have the people to do it, I mean you look No. 3 (Emmanwori), he's this nickel body for them, but he's so big and long, he has the ability to play the run at a very elite level, like a good linebacker,\" Kubiak said. \"But he's also really athletic and he can cover. He's really a jack of all trades.\"49ers quarterback Brock Purdy took note of Emmanwori's presence leading up to the game.\"He's a young, talented player that flies around, he's got length, he's gonna bring it for four quarters, he can cover, drop back in zone, he can do it all,\" Purdy said. Opposing coordinators and QBs always know where Emmanwori is on the field.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The former South Carolina Gamecock is having a similar impact to Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie, one of Steve Spagnuolo's key pieces during back-to-back Super Bowl runs. The Seahawks play almost exclusive zone coverage (80%, third highest in NFL) and rarely send extra pressure but when they do Macdonald comes from the Rex Ryan school of exotic blitzes. The Seahawks sent a defensive back pass rusher the fifth-most times in the NFL this year (109) and Emmanwori led all defensive backs in pressures (18).  When you can stop the run with a dominant front four and nickel or dime defense behind it, all without blitzing, all with two-high coverage, it's an incredible luxury in the passing game. No defense faces shorter passes on average than Seattle this year. They keep everything in front of them. This defense has not allowed a play to gain more than 20 yards in over a month. They are the only team since 2000 to go three straight games without allowing a play of more than 20 yards. That is why the 'Dark Side' is terrifying. Toughest challenge ahead vs. Rams on SundayIs it possible Los Angeles is the one team who doesn't fold vs. Seattle? The Seahawks have allowed six touchdowns in their last seven games, and four were against the Rams in Week 16. Sunday's rematch vs. the Rams No. 1 scoring offense is an opportunity to settle a score and for their biggest triumph yet. This is the ninth game between the No. 1 scoring offense and No. 1 scoring defense in the conference championship round or later since 1970. The top defense is 7-1 in the previous eight matchups, including wins by the \"Legion of Boom\" against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers in the 2014 NFC title game and the Broncos in the Super Bowl. The only offense to come out on top was the 49ers against the Broncos in the Super Bowl of the 1989 season. \nNo. 1 Scoring Offense vs. No. 1 Scoring Defense (Conf Champ or Later Since 1970)OffenseDefense2025 NFC ChampRamsSeahawks2016 Super BowlFalconsPatriots (won game)2014 NFC ChampPackersSeahawks (won game)2013 Super BowlBroncosSeahawks (won game)1990 Super BowlBillsGiants (won game)1989 Super Bowl49ers (won game)Broncos1984 Super BowlDolphins49ers (won game)1980 NFC ChampCowboysEagles (won game)1978 Super BowlCowboysSteelers (won game)The Rams will be joining them if they repeat what they did on offense last month when they dropped 37 points at Lumen Field. Matthew Stafford (457 yards, three touchdowns, no picks) and Puka Nacua (12 receptions, 225 yards, two scores) torched Seattle's secondary in historic fashion without the benefit of Davante Adams in the lineup. Stafford is the only QB in NFL history with 400-plus pass yards, at least three touchdown passes and no interceptions vs a team that finished with the NFL's top-scoring defense.A lot of his production in the pass game (15/24, 221 yards, three touchdowns) came with the Rams' patented 13 personnel vs. the Seahawks' patented nickel defense. Somehow, the Rams couldn't run the ball vs. Seattle's light defense, even with three tight ends on the field, but they had no problem passing it. Go figure. Nacua did a lot of the damage and he caught a pass on seven different defenders. The obvious solution would be to rotate more safety help and double team Nacua. Make someone else beat you. It'll be fascinating to watch the chess match on Sunday and see how Macdonald counters the success McVay had in their last matchup. The Seahawks may have gotten away with a win thanks to the luckiest two-point conversion of all-time (not to mention a bad illegal man downfield penalty that cost the Rams four points in the first quarter), but it will need answers on Sunday.\n            ",

Vine and UAE Team Emirates XRG teammate Mikkel Bjerg crashed into one of the animals after it hopped into the peloton. Bjerg and three other cyclists -- Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese -- were knocked out of the race because of the crash. The kangaroo was also injured and visibly struggled to make its way out of the road.Vine exchanged bikes with a teammate and rejoined the peloton multiple kilometers down the road. The incident occurred during a high-speed stretch of an eight-lap circuit outside of Adelaide.\nVine entered Stage 5 with a 1:03 lead over Switzerland's Mauro Schmid and won the tour by that exact margin despite the crash. He lost four of his six teammates throughout the tour because of multiple crashes, including the one with the kangaroos. His team announced that Jhonatan Narváez sustained several stable thoracic vertebrae compression fractures in one of those other accidents.\"Everyone asks me what's the most dangerous thing in Australia and I always tell them it's kangaroos,\" Vine said after the race. \"They wait and they hide in the bushes until you can't stop and they jump out in front of you. Point proven today.\n\"Two of them blasted through the peloton when we were doing probably 50 kph and one of them stopped and went left, right, left right, left right and I ended up hitting its backside.\"\n            \n    ",

This Seattle defense is much better than that Bears group. But Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has had success against them in the two games.\"The Seattle defense is the best unit of any left in the playoffs, which will challenge McVay to come up with new ways to move the football. The Rams lack great outside speed, and that showed up last week at Chicago. Keep an eye on that in this one. \"On the other side, the Rams defense has had some leakage issues in the secondary over the past six weeks. It is not a great group. The good news is Seattle wants to run it more than throw it.\n\"Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold is the key. If he can take care of the football, which he didn't do in a playoff loss to the Rams last year when he was with the Vikings, the Seahawks will win the game. I think he does. The Seattle defense is playing too good right now. That defensive front will disrupt the night for Stafford as the Seahawks get to the Super Bowl behind that defense.\" Pick: Seahawks 23, Rams 17To see Prisco's AFC Championship pick, click here.SportsLine's Larry Hartstein's Rams vs. Seahawks pickThere is no better resource when it comes to betting on Rams games than Hartstein. He's nailed 28 of his last 38 picks in games involving Los Angeles, and Harstein is now putting this NFC Championship in the crosshairs. We can tell you Hartstein is leaning Over the 47.5 total. To see his official pick for this game, however, you'll need to log on to SportsLine. Tyler Sullivan's Rams vs. Seahawks pickSeahawks -2.5: \"The Seahawks were the best defense in the NFL this season, allowing the fewest points per game (17.2), the lowest third-down conversion rate (32.05%), and the second fewest yards per play (4.6). They also haven't allowed a touchdown over their last two games, dating to the regular season.\n\"Matthew Stafford did have success against this defense earlier this year, but the veteran quarterback was a bit shaky at times last week against a Chicago defense that isn't in the same stratosphere as Seattle's. Stafford dealt with a solid amount of pressure and was sacked four times on the night. There was also a period against the Bears where he and the Rams punted six times over a seven-drive stretch. Chicago simply didn't take advantage. Seattle can, and will, especially if Kenneth Walker III gets rolling on the ground.\" Pick: Seahawks 30, Rams 20To see Sullivan's AFC Championship pick, click here.John Breech's Rams vs. Seahawks pickRams +2.5: \"The Seahawks only lost three games all year and all three of those games had one big thing in common: They turned the ball over multiple times. The Seahawks are so good that they only tend to lose when they beat themselves: They went 9-0 this season when their turnover number was one or zero, but they went 6-3  when they turned the ball over two times or more. \"The problem for the Seahawks is that if there's anyone who might turn the ball over multiple times in a big game, it's definitely Sam Darnold, especially if that game is against the Rams. In two games against L.A. this season, Darnold has been picked off six times. \n\"Darnold had the most turnovers by any player in the NFL this year with 20 (14 interceptions, six lost fumbles). Since 1990, only one QB has led the NFL in turnovers and won the Super Bowl in the same year, and that was Eli Manning, who did it thanks to a miracle run by the Giants in 2007. \"Darnold has faced the Rams four times since the beginning of last season and here's what has happened: He's been sacked 16 times, he's thrown seven interceptions and he's gone 1-3.\" Pick: Rams 30, Seahawks 23To see Breech's AFC Championship pick, click here.Mike McClure's top DFS for Championship SundayIf you want to add some DFS lineups to your Championship Sunday, Mike McClure is the expert you'll want to follow.

L.A. won the first game between these two teams and should have won the second one, and would have if not for one of the craziest two-point conversions anyone has ever seen. The Seahawks have an elite defense and home-field advantage, but when two teams are as close in quality as these two are, I always like to roll with whichever team has the advantage at quarterback, the game's most important position. In this case, that's Matthew Stafford and the Rams. I like them to advance with a closely-contested win.\" Pick: Rams 23, Seahawks 20To see Dubin's AFC Championship pick, click here.Jordan Dajani's Rams vs. Seahawks pickRams +2.5: \"My preseason Super Bowl pick was Ravens vs. Rams, and just because I was wrong about Baltimore does not mean I'm flaking on Los Angeles in this spot. Everyone is going to be on the Seahawks this week because of their incredible defense, but I will remind you that Matthew Stafford and Co. racked up 581 yards of total offense and 37 points in that overtime thriller in Seattle we witnessed last month. This pick comes down to me trusting Stafford and his fantastic cast of weapons more than Sam Darnold. The historical trends are in my favor as well. The Rams are 2-0 all-time vs. the Seahawks in the playoffs, and have won four straight NFC Championship game appearances.\"I know scoring points against this Seahawks defense will be tough. The only touchdowns they've allowed since Thanksgiving, not including the Rams matchup, are a Philip Rivers passing touchdown and a Bryce Young rushing touchdown. Still, I'm calling for the upset. Sean McVay is 5-2 against the spread and 4-3 straight up as an underdog in the playoffs.\" Pick: Rams 24, Seahawks 23\nTo see Dajani's AFC Championship pick, click here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- It has been apparent for some time that the club best placed to stop Arsenal winning the Premier League is Arsenal. Here was the blueprint for how they would do it. The performance was bad, the decision-making was questionable, the tension was overwhelming. Throw that into the mix with some incredible finishing from Manchester United, and you have the sort of strange brew that can convince the league leaders that they cannot achieve what is so comfortably within their capabilities.This was a team that, Sunday at least, seemed to have internalized that meme, the Arsenal-labelled figure holding an Arsenal-balled metal pipe, ready to slam it down on an Arsenal-labelled head. They had been plain-sailing before a clumsy pass by Martin Zubimendi handed Bryan Mbeumo an equaliser, but, you know what, that really wasn't any reason for the headloss that follows. Teams give away sloppy goals all the time, most of them a lot more frequently than Arsenal.All that was required from then on was to get back to the team they had been beforehand. They were controlling the game with and without the ball, manufacturing transition moments for themselves on the rare occasions United advanced the ball upfield and baiting Senne Lammens to hoof the ball straight back to them through their press. A flick by Patrick Dorgu when a cross went into the box muddied the statistical waters, but effectively Arsenal's first goal came from a 26-pass sequence in which they pulled their opposition one way and another before applying the killer blow.At their peak, Arsenal proved they had the quality of champions. That has never been in question. What doubts there have been are over their temperament and those were only vindicated when they let the leash off their inner saboteur. \nArteta was not quite sure how to explain the clumsy run of misplaced passes that ended with United's equalizer. He said of it, \"The fact that you want to be more protective probably doesn't help to make those mistakes because there were three or four, to be fair, that were very unusual today in the game, and they are part of football. \"Sometimes you get punished and sometimes not, and today we got punished, and apart from that, we have to give credit to the opponent for what they've done and in the manner that they managed to win the game.\"\n        \n            \n                Mikel Arteta urges Arsenal fans to 'create more energy' at Emirates ahead of Manchester United clash\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDon't take anything away from Manchester United, whose three goals were uniformly excellent, even the one provided for them by Zubimendi. They opened the door to a glass cage of emotions. It was Arsenal, though, that threw away the key.\nOne mistake after the opener begat another begat another. Dorgu's thunderbolt was enough to momentarily discombobulate any team but there were still what proved to be 47 minutes left to play. You would not have known it by the way Arsenal went about their task.Too much haste, too little control. Declan Rice can bend them in from almost anywhere, but with 25 minutes to go and Arsenal setting up court on the edge of the United box, a low probability swing like that just gave Lammens a chance to let the clock run and the nerves build. That was typical of the second half. If there was bait left out for the Gunners, they'd foul it. At a time when Michael Carrick was perfectly happy for his side to drop deep and defend, Arsenal somehow managed to rapidly increase the speed of their attacking sequences and cut the average number of passes. In the desperate late charge, such an approach is totally understandable, perhaps even optimal. With nearly half a game to go, though, the league leaders shouldn't be in Hail Mary mode just because they're a goal down.Within minutes of United's second, Arteta had made four substitutions that he would insist afterwards brought control to the game. It is fair to acknowledge that none of Zubimendi, Piero Hincapie, Martin Odegaard nor Gabriel Jesus were setting the occasion alight. However, the latter two in particular would have enabled Arsenal to play a better version of the possession-dominant approach that had them on top early on. Though Mikel Merino's introduction proved valuable -- his bundling home of a corner late on raised hopes of a mentality-affirming comeback -- both the players and the message sent from a quadruple change seemed to heighten the sense of desperation in the air. Arteta's geeing up of supporters only added to that.\nOne of Arteta's great triumphs has been to change the energy of the Emirates Stadium, a ground that until recently seemed to believe it could will goals without any need for Arsenal players to get involved. Now this seems a crowd crushed by the unbearable weight of being on the cusp of greatness. Once Mbeumo equalized, almost every misplaced pass or move that wasn't brought audible despair. The players are responsible for their performance, but it cannot be denied that it is a harder environment for them to excel when there are so many nerves being transmitted in their direction.Whether it was more than that at halftime and at the final whistle might depend on where you sat. There were suggestions of a smattering of boos for a team that is still four points clear at the top of the Premier League. Though they weren't audible in the West Stand, there were still visible incidents of fans berating each other amid the exodus that followed Matheus Cunha's goal. In that moment, it was as if north London had travelled back to 2016 and the internecine wars of Arsene Wenger's final days. \"We have to understand that we all want to win,\" said Arteta, \"and the crowd is trying to be behind the team to make the best decisions and to win the game.\" None of that is untrue. The frustrations and fears are valid. It doesn't mean they are helpful. \nThe counterpoint is that Arsenal have been here for years now. Their fans know what it feels like to fall short because it feels like that is what has been happening right the way through. It hasn't really though, has it? Last season, injuries turned a title challenge from likelihood to impossibility by Christmas. No one wants to hear how the underlying data pointed to a team due a slowdown for most of 2022-23, but it did suggest that a young side would never be able to hold out against prime Manchester City. Only in 2023-24 did Arsenal really have a chance down the stretch. This is hardly the work of serial bottlers. Sometimes you go 16-1-1 and City still do enough.No one seems to believe this to be true, though, and right now, facts really are being eclipsed by feelings. The critique offered by Patrick Vieira was not that this team lacked quality or depth but that they might not have the mental strength of champions, something he knows only too well as the captain of sides who both went unbeaten in 2003-04 and who had collapsed down the stretch a year earlier.\"We accept every opinion, where it comes and where it's coming from, and they will have the right reason to say it,\" said Arteta of Vieira. \"At the end, we have to show the mental strength that we have on the pitch when it comes to a match day.\n\"We were absolutely brilliant in Milan, and today we weren't that good. I don't know if it was mental, because of how much they played, but because we were poor, especially technically in certain aspects of the game, against a team that when you make those mistakes, they can punish you big time. That was the difference.\"Arsenal were poor, United impressive but this was still a game decided by two wonder goals and one rare error from Zubimendi. The foundations are solid and though there is work to do on the attack -- isn't there always? -- the opposition have to do quite remarkable things to get two or more goals against Arteta's men.Arsenal could do with remembering that. It's how they got themselves a sizeable lead over rivals who don't look like they can consistently eat into it. Arsenal may be the best placed club to stop Arsenal winning the Premier League, but they're also the club who might only need to shut out the voices if they are to win the greatest prize.\n            ",

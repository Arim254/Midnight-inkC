    "body": "\n        HARTFORD, Conn. — It was the kind of victory that can give a team ultimate belief, because it might be the definitive evidence, that it can win a national championship.It was also the kind of loss that can kill a team's hopes and spirit for the remainder of the season.What sixth-ranked Connecticut did to No. 15 St. John's at PeoplesBank Arena on Wednesday night was more than just a record-setting 32-point evisceration. It was an emphatic socking, the likes of which the Red Storm might not shake off the effects from for weeks, if not until next season. The Huskies' 72-40 vaporizing was arguably the most impressive game played by any team almost four months into this brilliant 2025-26 college basketball campaign.\"What we did today as a rebounding team, as a defensive team, as a team that looked like we did offensively at times in the championship years,\" Huskies coach Dan Hurley told CBS Sports outside the locker room. \"Twenty assists, four turnovers, really, because we took a we took a turnover late in the game. Out-rebounded a team that kicks ass on the glass.\"\nIronically, it was all of a week ago when UConn fell 91-84 at home to mediocre Creighton to take its second loss in four games, bookending that with the 81-72 defeat against St. John's at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 6, when the Johnnies snapped the Huskies' 18-game winning streak.\"The defense has been a joke,\" Hurley said after that loss to Creighton. \"Our defense has been so bad. We've been playing with fire.\"On Wednesday, Hurley's Huskies tamed the flame and used it to burn out the will of St. John's — snapping its 13-game winning streak — and perhaps scorching its chances of doing something of significance over the next month. The Huskies suffocated the Red Storm by doing the near impossible, not allowing a made field goal from the 17:28 mark of the second half until the end of the game. \n\"This is a rivalry,\" Hurley told me, and it was obvious how much pride he felt to win so convincingly with all of the anticipation this game brought. \"I've got a lot of respect for what they do and the amount of success they've had, particularly in Big East play. ... It was a must-win game today.\"\nUConn heating up for March as usual UConn played like the program's existence depended on a victory. Credit to assistant Kimani Young, who was assigned the scout, and whose time to get a head-coaching job at the high-major level is overdue.The Huskies set a program record for their largest win over St. John's, surpassing the 29-point mark from 1998. They also won a home game over a ranked team by 30-plus points for the first time in school history. The game felt near-over at halftime when it was 41-26. Then it felt violent in the final 10 minutes. It felt personal. \nThe UConn team looked — not a lot like — but pretty much exactly like the 2023 and 2024 title-winning squads. There's one eye-opening stat after another attached to this one.The 32-point loss was the worst by St. John's as a ranked team since a 35-point loss to St. Bonaventure in 1960. The Red Storm shot 19.6% on 11-of-56 shooting, the worst shooting performance by any team in Division I this season. It happened because St. John's made its first two field goals of the second half and then missed 24 in a row, also the worst streak by any team in college basketball. \nSJU's best player, Zuby Ejiofor, was held to one point in the first half while his counterpart, senior big man Tarris Reed Jr., finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds, six blocks and two steals in 31 minutes in what was the best game of his career.\"I've never been through that experience,\" Ejiofor said, later adding, \"tonight was not what I was expecting at all.\"Reed became the third Husky to ever log at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks against a ranked team, joining Donovan Clingan (twice) and Emeka Okafor (three times).\nLoss might linger for St. John's  Adding to the embarrassment for Red Storm coach Rick Pitino, he coached a team to just 40 points, marking the lowest of a career that is 1,224 games deep. The previous low came when he was at Boston University in 1981 and his Terriers managed just 43 on the road against UCLA.\"Give [UConn] all the credit,\" Pitino said. \"They played a great game. That's probably only happened to me two times in my career. ... So, it's all on me. I'm very disappointed in our performance offensively, especially sharing the ball, moving the ball. So, it's all on me, but we'll get ready for Villanova.\"\n        \n            \n                Rick Pitino takes blame for St. John's dreadful performance in historic loss to UConn: 'It's all on me'\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlthough Pitino credited UConn and did own the loss, he did not handle himself well in the aftermath, which speaks to how much this result obviously and understandably burns him. Still, Pitino easily could have walked to the press conference room and taken questions for four or five minutes but opted not to — something that the Big East office will not appreciate — and instead gave one statement and took one question from a reporter, totaling less than 1 minute and 15 seconds after one of the two most important Big East games of the season.\n\"We're still playing for a championship,\" Pitino said. \"It doesn't matter whether you lose by one or 40, the league championship's still at stake. Obviously, we got to make our corrections and move on.\"The loss looks all the worse coming mere hours after this social media post from Pitino earlier on Wednesday.\nThe Red Storm's résumé looks fairly weak in light of this loss by the way. Its only two quality wins are home against UConn (extremely good) and on the road against Villanova (pretty good). At 22-6, the Johnnies are well on their way to earning a single-digit NCAA seed, but it felt like there was a fracture here in Hartford. SJU is now 1-4 against ranked teams this season. \nMeantime, UConn 29-12 against AP-ranked teams the last four seasons, the most wins of any team in the sport. The Huskies look dynasty-good again. The Red Storm need to do more to prove last year wasn't a one-off pop back into relevancy. This game was supposed to be for the supremacy of the Big East. Maybe it was.And maybe it's going to result in UConn ascending to the top tier of national title contender beside Duke, Michigan and Arizona, while St. John's settles into something inferior. Their league records are tied, it's true, with both at two losses apiece. St. John's still has three more games left, including next up hosting Villanova in a huge game for seeding and the Big East race.\nUConn will finish atop the league if it handles business vs. Seton Hall and at Marquette, both likelihoods.I asked Hurley if he used any special or different motivation tactics in advance of Wednesday's historic outcome.\"Nothing,\" he said. \"Coming out of the Creighton game, we got complacent going into that game. And because we played so well at Creighton, I think maybe I didn't have the team as ready as I needed to, and it put us in this must-win situation the rest of the way to win the regular season. The team is playing right now like these are elimination games, and it's a good time of year to play with that level of desperation. The fact that we have to win every game the rest of the way to get at least a piece of the regular season, the Big East has forced us to have to play like playoff Game 7s right now, and I think that's going to bode well for us the rest of the way.\"\nHurley has built up and fortified one of the toughest programs in college basketball. A championship-level outfit that is required to carry over year to year. Teams that operate at that standard aren't just capable of, but actually provide evidence to the type of supremacy on display Wednesday night. Just about everyone — Ejiofor included — wants to see the third act in Midtown Manhattan on Saturday, March 14. The Big East championship game. But if we don't get it, UConn's win on Wednesday and the aftereffects may well be the reason. The Huskies are the fourth projected No. 1 seed, and it's hard to see them spoiling that spot until the Big East title game at the absolute earliest. These teams' seasons collided in Hartford, and given how violent the impact was, it's hard to see both going in similar directions the rest of the season.\n            ",

Now he will be immortalized in Monument Park. On Wednesday, the New York Yankees announced Sabathia's No. 52 will be retired on Sept. 26. He will be the 24th player to have his number retired by the franchise.\"The Yankees was the place that wanted me,\" Sabathia said after being voted into Cooperstown. \"I've been here now 16 years. I love the other organizations, but this is home. I found a home in the Bronx and I don't think I'll ever leave this city.\"\nSigned to a then-pitcher record $161 million contract in December 2008, Sabathia was the ace of New York's most recent World Series championship team in 2009, and he played 11 of his 19 MLB seasons with the Yankees. He was most successful early during his tenure in the Bronx, pitching to a 3.22 ERA and averaging 239 innings per year from 2009-11.Sabathia went to three All-Star Games with the Yankees and finished in the top four of the Cy Young voting three times. He received MVP votes in three seasons as well. All told, Sabathia went 134-88 with the Yankees and had a 3.81 ERA in nearly 2,000 innings. He is top 10 in franchise history in wins, starts and strikeouts.\nBeyond his on-field contributions, Sabathia was also a beloved teammate, clubhouse leader and remains a fan favorite. He still regularly attends games at Yankee Stadium as a fan. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has credited Sabathia with changing the team's culture after signing ahead of the 2009 season.\n        \n            \n                MLB Power Rankings: Picking the best rotations for the 2026 baseball season\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSabathia will be the first player to have his number retired by the Yankees since Paul O'Neill's No. 21 in August 2022. The Yankees have the most retired numbers in baseball and even requested that their coaches not wear numbers so more are available for their players.Before signing with the Yankees, Sabathia pitched for Cleveland (2001-08) and the Milwaukee Brewers (2008). He retired with a 251-161 record and 3.74 ERA. His 3,093 strikeouts are third all-time among lefties behind Randy Johnson (4,875) and Steve Carlton (4,136).\nThe Yankees will also dedicate a plaque in Sabathia's honor in Monument Park on Sept. 26th. The team has not reissued his No. 52 since his final season. He has a Yankees logo on his Hall of Fame plaque.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Tennessee Titans entered Wednesday with almost $100 million in cap space, the most in the NFL. That number increased after the team decided to release veterans Lloyd Cushenberry and Xavier Woods with the official start of free agency just two weeks away. Tennessee will save about $3.4 million in salary cap space by parting with Cushenberry, who was released with a failed physical designation. They'll save roughly $4 million in cap space by releasing Woods, a veteran safety who played in 11 games last year before a hamstring injury ended his season.\nA former third-round pick of the Denver Broncos, Cushenberry was released less than two years after the Titans signed him to a four-year, $50 million contract. An Achilles injury, however, sidelined him for the final games of the 2024 season. He played in 15 games this past season after starting the year on the team's physically unable to perform list. \nDespite going 3-14 last season, the Titans have put themselves in a position to make a significant leap in 2026. In addition to having the most salary cap space in the NFL, the Titans are also armed with eight picks in the upcoming NFL Draft that includes the No. 4 overall pick. Speaking from the combine, Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi said that the team is going to \"attack both acquisition periods\" while alluding to the upcoming free agency period as well as April's draft. It appears, based on Borgonzi's comments, that the Titans are putting an added emphasis on the draft. \n\"You're trying to build a team and a locker room and a culture, and you do that through the draft,\" he said during an interview with Pat McAfee. \"We're certainly going to have our hand in free agency as well, and there's going to be some great opportunities to add some players in free agency. But really, through, the draft is where you have to build that foundation initially. ... You've got to build it through the draft.\" While the Titans' decision to release Cushenberry and Woods creates new voids in terms of building the roster for 2026, Tennessee clearly has the recourses to fill those voids this offseason. As it currently stands, the Titans' depth chart at center is led by soon-to-be free agency Corey Levin and 2025 undrafted rookie Drew Moss. Kendell Brooks, a fellow former undrafted rookie who has spent the last two seasons in Nashville, is currently slated to replace Woods in the starting lineup . \nWhile the Titans will undoubtedly address both of positions this offseason, the team will likely continue to prioritize improving other areas of greater need on their roster, specifically pass rusher and the skill positions. \n            ",

They pulled one back in the first half thanks to Manuel Locatelli. Though Lloyd Kelly's red card in the 49th minute complicated matters, Federico Gatti's 70th-minute goal put the Turin-based side within touching distance of extra time. McKennie's goal in the 82nd minute, though, ensured the hosts would get another 30 minutes to prove themselves in the hopes of reaching the round of 16.The hosts earned a free kick on the left flank, the ball looping to the far end of the box, where Teun Koopmeiners was waiting. Koopmeiners, who scored a brace at Galatasaray last week, sent the ball near the opposite post, the ball sailing towards the goal line. McKennie had his eyes on the ball as soon as it neared Koopmeiners' head and made a run to meet it at the post, and then got his head on the ball to ensure it landed in the back of the net.Watch the strike below.\nGalasaray turned things around in extra time and scored twice, first through Victor Osimhen's goal shortly before the halftime break and then another from Barıs Alper Yilmaz in the 119th minute. The victors are now in the Champions League round of 16 for the first time in 12 years and are the first Turkish team since the 2017-18 season to get this far.\nThe goal was McKennie's eighth of the season across all competitions for Juventus, the U.S. men's national team midfielder already in the midst of a career-best goalscoring run. He played as a left wingback on Wednesday, which comes as little surprise for the team's longtime utility player, but he has been in attack-minded roles since Luciano Spalletti became the coach last fall. Spalletti has showcased McKennie's versatility even as attack remains the focus, once describing him as the \"perfect central striker\" and even inserting him there at Galatasaray last week.McKennie finds his footingWin or lose, it's hard not to argue that the knockout phase playoffs were full of good news for the USMNT – McKennie's goal comes a day after Johnny Cardoso scored for Atletico Madrid and a week after Folarin Balogun notched a brace for Monaco. Coupled with the fact that U.S. players across Europe are currently in fine form and others, like Bournemouth's Tyler Adams and PSV's Ricardo Pepi, are returning to the pitch after weeks-long injuries, it feels like the USMNT players are beginning to peak at just the right time as the World Cup nears.McKennie, though, is perhaps the poster child for the USMNT players' upward trajectory. The 27-year-old has made the rare transition from a mere regular in Juventus' lineup to a central part of the team's attack, Spalletti fully utilizing the American's attacking skillset after a handful of predecessors chose otherwise. It has paid off in more ways than one – Juventus have added another dimension to their goalscoring operation, McKennie is useful from set-piece opportunities, and often makes impactful runs to score goals from close range. McKennie's contributions are much-needed for a Juventus team that could use an out-and-out goalscorer, the American doing his best to make up the gaps.From the player's perspective, the goalscoring run is a signal that things have changed for the better in Turin. He has frequently been deemed surplus to requirements, only to stick around to make up the numbers and work his way back into the coach's good graces. There was no adjustment period with Spalletti, though – not only has he been a regular fixture in the new coach's team, Spalletti has gotten the best out of McKennie, no matter the task the player's been assigned. Take Wednesday's match as an example – McKennie regularly finds himself on the wing in Spalletti's set-up, but he rarely plays as a left wingback for the new coach, though he remained an attacking force for a Juventus team in desperate need of goals. He created four chances from that position, his best game of the season in that sense, and later scored at the end of a set-piece sequence.\nMcKennie is expected to be back for the USMNT's friendlies against Portugal and Belgium in March, likely to join the national team for the first time since October after head coach Mauriico Pochettino preferred the player settle in with Spalletti during the November international break. McKennie's form is as great a form of vindication as Pochettino could receive for that choice, leaving the head coach with only good problems as a wide variety of players compete for World Cup roster spots – and starting roles. McKennie's abilities in goal creation and end product leave Pochettino with just as many options as Spalletti to utilize the player's versatility, both skills well-suited for the U.S. coach's high-intensity, attack-minded style of play.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- The Cleveland Cavaliers announced that star guard James Harden suffered a fractured right thumb during their 109-94 win over the New York Knicks Tuesday night. Harden played 32 minutes and finished with 20 points, four assists and two rebounds, but a subsequent evaluation of his thumb confirmed the presence of a fracture.Despite the diagnosis, surgery is not required and Harden is not expected to miss much time, per ESPN. The expectation is that Harden will wear a wrap or splint on his hand as he attempts to play through the injury. He was initially listed as questionable for Wednesday night's game against the Milwaukee Bucks before being ruled out. \"A postgame examination by the Cavaliers' medical staff, followed by X-rays taken [Wednesday], confirmed a non-displaced fracture of the distal phalanx,\" the team said. \"Harden will undergo treatment and continued evaluation. An update on his status will be provided as appropriate.\"Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said Wednesday that Harden was not complaining about his thumb during Tuesday's game, and he was unsure when the injury occurred. He declined to go into specifics about a timeline or plan for Harden and said the team will have more information after he's evaluated.\"I don't have my lab coat on, I'm not gonna go there,\" Atkinson said. \"I do think it's early. I think these things take time. Obviously, James is famous for his availability. There's a lot that goes into this. For me to sit here and start making judgments -- we'll have more information once the medical staff looks at him a little more.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NBA MVP Rankings: Victor Wembanyama jumps into top three, Cade Cunningham could win by default\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt appears Cleveland has avoided disaster with Harden not being immediately ruled out for a significant period of time. The Cavs have gone 6-1 since trading for Harden in early February. He has established immediate chemistry with Donovan Mitchell in the backcourt, giving Cleveland someone who can take offensive pressure off Mitchell in a way Darius Garland couldn't.\"They're two guys that are hungry to take that next step, and they've hit it off. Kinda been seamless, really,\" Atkinson said of the relationship between Mitchell and Harden. \"Got two guys who are so passionate about the game, they're both hoop junkies, they're both smart and they both have great [work] ethics. Usually, when you have that kind of synergy, it goes well. Really with them I haven't seen any misunderstandings or 'You should have went there.' They've been pretty locked in on the court and off the court. Couldn't have gone better so far.\"Harden is averaging 18.9 points, eight rebounds and 4.6 assists as a member of the Cavs. Before the trade, he averaged 25.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.8 assists in 44 games for the Los Angeles Clippers this season.\nCleveland (37-22) is tied with the Knicks for third in the Eastern Conference and 2.5 games ahead of the Toronto Raptors (34-24). How much the injury impacts Harden remains to be seen as the Cavaliers try to make a deep playoff run.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly two years after the NBA banned him for life for a violation of league gambling rules, former Toronto Raptors and Memphis Grizzlies forward Jontay Porter has a role with a different professional basketball league. The Seattle SuperHawks of the United States Basketball League announced that they signed Porter to their 2026 roster, giving him his first playing opportunity since the exit from the NBA.Porter's arrival in the USBL raises eyebrows, particularly because of the league's stated commitment to fair competition.\"The games we play must be decided on the court,\" the USBL says as part of its league values. \"Every rule we establish, every policy we implement, and every decision we make is guided by a commitment to fair competition. Players, coaches, and fans must be able to trust that the outcomes they witness are earned through skill, preparation, and effort -- nothing else.\"The SuperHawks are one of eight teams in the rebirth of the USBL, which opens its season on March 6. The league originally operated from 1985-2008 and produced a number of eventual NBA players including Manute Bol and Spud Webb.Porter is tied to the FBI investigation into illegal sports betting, which shook the NBA last fall, and he previously pleaded guilty in 2024 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Two defendants in the federal case allegedly threatened Porter, forcing him to remain involved in a scheme wherein parties gathered inside information on NBA games and relayed it to bettors.\nIrregular betting activity on Porter's player props in 2024 flagged potential wrongdoing. The NBA found that Porter disclosed information about his health status to a bettor ahead of a March 20 game, and another bettor wagered $80,000 on a parlay that would win $1.1 million if the under hit on Porter's player props. Porter exited from that game due to illness less than three minutes into the contest. The bet was frozen and never paid out.After a separate game earlier that season, DraftKings sent a report to users that stated the under on Porter's made 3-pointers was the biggest winner among all NBA props from Jan. 26, 2024.The NBA also found that Porter placed at least 13 bets on NBA games from January to March 2024 using an associate's account. He wagered a combined $54,094 and netted $21,965. None of those purported bets involved games in which Porter played, but he bet on the Raptors to lose as part of a multi-game parlay.\nPorter's case is one of the few rare instances in which the NBA disciplined a player for violating its gambling policy. The league prohibits anyone affiliated with the NBA from betting on NBA properties and requires players to attend anti-gambling training sessions on an annual basis. It also employs data scientists to monitor sports betting issues.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the fantasy basketball season winds down, deep-league managers know that streaming can be the difference between climbing the standings and falling short. With injuries, suspensions, and late-season shutdowns reshaping rotations, opportunity is emerging in unexpected places. This article highlights 10 under-the-radar players who are seeing expanded roles and turning increased minutes into tangible production. From recent trade additions to young contributors capitalizing on frontcourt vacancies, these names offer short-term upside with category juice. If you're searching for rebounds, defensive stats, or a 3-point boost, these viable streaming options can provide a timely edge in competitive deep formats.Kobe Brown, PacersBrown joined the Pacers via trade at the deadline. After averaging 8.7 minutes per game through his first 34 appearances of the season with the Clippers, he is up to 27.2 minutes per game with his new squad. He is making good use of his expanded role, averaging 10 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 0.7 steals per game, including hauling in a season-high 10 rebounds in the most recent outing. He is likely to continue to see a notable role, as the Pacers work through injury trouble and are not expected to push their regular stars too hard without a shot at the postseason. Guerschon Yabusele, BullsYabusele found a new home with the Bulls via trade in early February and has been thriving ever since. He averaged just 8.9 minutes per game through 41 appearances with the Knicks, but is up to  25.5 minutes per game, including six starts through eight outings since joining the Bulls. He is averaging 10.6 points, six rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 0.8 steals per game with his new squad, including two double-doubles and a single-game season-high of eight assists. He should continue to handle a notable role within their limited frontcourt rotation. Olivier-Maxence Prosper, GrizzliesProsper was locked into a deep bench role for most of the season until late January, when he began to see more consistent action. His playing time picked up after the Grizzlies parted ways with Jaren Jackson, allowing Prosper to take a step up in the rotation. He is averaging 12.7 points, 4.5 rebounds, one assist, and one steal over his last 10 appearances, playing more than 20 minutes in eight. He topped the 20-point mark for the first time this season twice within his last five outings and is converting a blistering 71.4 percent from the field over that span.  \nPaul Reed, PistonsReed has been a solid contributor all season for the Pistons, but was mostly limited in his opportunities, falling behind Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart at the center position. However, with Stewart being suspended, Reed has stepped up to deliver an average of 16.3 points, 6.5 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.5 steals, and 2.5 blocks, while shooting 64.4 percent from the field over the last four games. While Stewart will be out until March 3, there is still time to take advantage of Reed's expanded role. Julian Strawther, NuggetsStrawther has been making the most of a boost in playing time during the injury absence of Peyton Watson, who is set to remain out for at least another week. Strawther is averaging 15.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and one steal, with 2.3 made 3-pointers per game over six consecutive starts. His ability to contribute on both ends and the addition of his long-range shooting make him stand out from most players on this list. He should continue to prosper in the expanded role until Watson is back, but he will also likely retain a fair amount of playing time beyond that point.  Precious Achiuwa, KingsAchiuwa has seen his role pick up for a while now. But with the more recent addition of Dylan Cardwell to the injury report, as well as Domantas Sabonis being shut down, he is now in line to handle a significant role through the remainder of the season. Achiuwa is averaging 12.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists, two steals, and one block in 24.8 minutes per game over five consecutive starts. He also has two double-doubles in his last three outings, including his first 20-and-10 game of the campaign in the most recent outing. \nYanic Konan Niederhauser, ClippersKonan Niederhauser saw very limited action to start the season but has earned a notable boost since his squad parted ways with starting center Ivica Zubac. Konan Niederhauser is still in competition with Brook Lopez for minutes at the position, but is making his case as a reliable option, averaging 5.9 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks in 15.4 minutes per game over the last eight games. He has scored in double digits twice and has hauled in a high of eight rebounds twice in that span. He is also coming off the best defensive display of his young career, with four blocks in the last game. John Konchar, JazzKonchar is settling into his new home with the Jazz after being traded from the Grizzlies, along with Jaren Jackson. He has been a modest contributor throughout his NBA career, showing a knack for long-range shooting. Although he has yet to stand out offensively for his new squad, he has made a strong impression with his defensive impact, an area where he has also shown success in the past. He is averaging 4.2 rebounds and two steals in 22.2 minutes per game across six games. He could be a sneaky add for managers needing a boost in the above-mentioned areas. It is unclear how his playing time may hold up down the stretch, but with the recent injury to Vince Williams, there may be room for him to continue to pick up a fair amount of floor time. Baylor Scheierman, CelticsThe Celtics have cycled through a few different players at the starting wing positions this season, but Scheierman is the most recent standout, as he is averaging 8.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 0.7 steals over the last 10 games. His field-goal percentage is underwhelming, at 43.7, but he is knocking down 1.6 3s per game as a consolation. The second-year forward also has three double-doubles with points and rebounds among the last 10 games and should continue to enjoy a notable role that is his to lose. \nJa'Kobe Walter, RaptorsWalter is averaging 18.8 minutes per game on the season but has seen a boost and delivered improved production since the beginning of February, where he is averaging 9.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 1.3 steals, along with two made 3s per game over seven games. He looks to be earning his way by providing an intense defensive effort. There is certainly room for him to solidify a dedicated role as an energy guy off the bench, as the Raptors look to find their rhythm heading towards a postseason run. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        If fortune truly does favor the bold, watch out for flyweight prospect Lone'er Kavanagh in the main event of Saturday's UFC Fight Night card in Mexico City. Kavanagh (9-1), the 26-year-old from London who fights out of the Great Britain Top Team gym, agreed to replace the injured Asu Almabayev on just three weeks' notice and face former two-time flyweight champion Brandon Moreno inside Arena CDMX. In his opponent's backyard. In the first five-round bout of his career. Fresh off of a knockout defeat to Charles Johnson last August in the first loss of his career. Not to mention, at an elevation of over 7,000 feet. \"It's an amazing opportunity and it's one of these things that I pray for. So, for it to come up, I have to take it,\" Kavanagh told CBS Sports HQ on Tuesday. \"There was no hesitation, whatsoever [to accept the fight]. Obviously, I had to talk it over with my team to make sure that we were all on the same page. Once we were, it was go time.\"\nJust like Kavanagh, the 32-year-old Moreno will also be looking to bounce back from defeat just two months removed from a second-round TKO loss to Tatsuro Taira -- the first stoppage loss of Moreno's 34-fight pro career -- that elevated Taira to the title level where he will face Joshua Van at UFC 327 in April. But the Kavanagh defeat has some odd synergy with that of Van's first UFC loss. Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription. Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Van, the 24-year-old sensation from Myanmar who upset Alexandre Pantoja for the flyweight title in December, also lost by knockout against Charles Johnson in 2024 to snap a red-hot start to his UFC career that began with three straight wins in the span of seven months. Like Kavanagh, Van simply got caught against a dangerous fighter and returned to action quickly just two months later to begin a run of six straight wins over the next 15 months. \nKavanagh had plenty of success in the first round against Johnson last summer but was caught backing up with his hands down along the cage in Round 2 and suffered a flash knockout on a sweeping right hook. \"Obviously, for me, it's about getting better in every fight,\" Kavanagh said. \"Unfortunately, I didn't get the result I wanted in the last fight but there is now stuff to work on. And that's what I have done from my last fight until right now, it's always self improving.\"Before making a splash on \"The Dana White Contender Series\" in 2024, when he knocked out An Tuan Ho in just over two minutes to earn a UFC contract, Kavanagh's name first began to generate buzz in the U.K.-based Cage Warriors promotion, where he won four straight fights beginning in 2022. It's the same respected European regional promotion that helped catapult both Conor McGregor and Paddy Pimblett into star runs inside the Octagon. \nKavanagh considers the path of both fighters as an inspiration for his own journey.\"Of course, coming through the Cage Warriors platform, they set a path to get to the UFC,\" Kavanagh said. \"They set a blueprint. Even my teammate, [UFC featherweight] Nathaniel Wood, came up the same way. So, it's just about following the blueprint.\"Despite a recent TKO loss (and one that Moreno still believes came via an early stoppage), the former two-time flyweight king and first Mexican-born champion in UFC history remains the betting favorite. Moreno, a native of Tijuana who now fights out of Las Vegas, has advantages in everything from experience to fighting in front of a passionate home crowd.\nStill, Kavanagh believes timing is everything. He remains confident about his skills and isn't against going toe-to-toe with Moreno for as long as the five-round bout lasts in order to prove he's the next-big thing at 125 pounds. \"I think it's my mindset, my speed, my timing and my power [that give me an advantage over Moreno,]\" Kavanagh said. \"It's not just about fight IQ. I have an amazing team behind me and we have worked hard for this. It's all going to show on Saturday night.\"I want to look back on my life and see that I've done some cool stuff. The big thing for me is legacy and this is a legendary moment, so I'm looking forward to it It just brings me one step closer to the title and that's what I want. I'm here to get to the top as quick as I can and I'm looking to do whatever it takes to get there.\"\nAsked whether he believes he's getting Moreno at the right time so close to a recent defeat, Kavanagh's answer was telling.\"In terms of catching him at the right time, I don't think there is a right time or a wrong time,\" Kavanagh said. It's just my time.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In about a month's time, we'll learn whether shortstop and hotshot prospect Konnor Griffin has done enough to win an Opening Day roster spot with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Griffin, the No. 9 pick in the 2024 Draft, won't turn 20 until April 24. If he makes the team, he would be the first teenage position player to appear in a big league game since Juan Soto in 2019. Griffin made his case for the shortstop job emphatically Monday, going 2 for 4 with two home runs against the Boston Red Sox. That includes a two-run shot off $130 million lefty Ranger Suárez and a 440-foot tank out of the stadium. \"I heard very good things about him. Great, great ballplayer. A very good hitter and you can see that,\" Suárez told MLB.com after the game. \"I suppose when you're the top prospect in the game that people expect  that from you, and he did it today.\" CBS Sports ranked Griffin as the No. 3 prospect in baseball, thanks to his undeniable talent. He hit .333/.415/.527 with 21 home runs and 65 steals last year, and reached Double-A as a teenager. Pittsburgh's current shortstop is Nick Gonzales, a second baseman with minimal shortstop experience and poor defensive numbers. Hardly an obstacle. \nHere's our prospect write-up on Griffin headed into the 2026 season: The rap on Griffin during his amateur days was that he had every tool but the hit tool, the most important of the bunch. It was encouraging, then, to see him ease concerns about his swing-and-miss during his first pro season. He connected on more than 75% of his attempts while showing off the power (he cleared the 114 mph threshold) and speed (he stole 65 bases) combination that gave him a high ceiling. Griffin even kept his strikeout rate under 24% during a 21-game stint in Double-A, suggesting that he wasn't just feasting on younger pitchers or those with less raw talent. Knowing when to adjust priors is one of the trickiest parts of evaluating players. Given everything about Griffin's year, it would be silly to ignore how much higher his chances of reaching his star ceiling are now than they were 365 days ago. \tThere are valid reasons to send Griffin back to the minors to begin 2026. He's never played in Triple-A, has only 21 career games in Double-A, and, again, he's 19. Sending him down for a few months for some fine-tuning -- those two homers are his only two hits in the early going this spring -- ahead of a second half call-up would be perfectly reasonable defensible. At the same time, the Pirates invested heavily (relatively speaking) to boost what was MLB's worst offense a year ago, and clearly they need a shortstop. Griffin is a special talent and special talents do special things, like debut as 19 year olds. Pairing Griffin with Paul Skenes for as long as possible should be the priority. Putting Griffin on the Opening Day roster would accomplish that. Regardless of when they call him up, the Pirates surely want to keep Griffin in Pittsburgh as long as possible. The two sides are said to have mutual interest in a long-term extension, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Of course, that doesn't mean a deal will get done. He and the Pirates could have very different opinions of his value and be far apart on dollars. There is a great benchmark for extending a top prospect before his MLB debut: Jackson Chourio, who inked an eight-year contract worth $82 million with the Milwaukee Brewers in December 2023. Like Griffin, Chourio was one of the top prospects in baseball at the time, and he played only six career games in Triple-A. A deal of that size for a minor leaguer was unprecedented. \nIt more than worked out though. The Brewers put Chourio on the 2024 Opening Day roster and he rewarded them with a 3.9 WAR season and a third-place finish in the Rookie of the Year voting. Milwaukee identified Chourio as one of their best players in 2024 and beyond, locked him up, and put him on the roster. The Pirates are at a similar point with Griffin. Chourio's extension is working out well, plus there are two years of salary inflation to consider, so we would have to adjust upward for Griffin. An eight-year deal would take him through his age-27 season and likely run upwards of $100 million. Chourio's contract includes two club options, something Pittsburgh would surely push for in talks with Griffin. An eight-year extension would allow the Pirates keep Griffin beyond the usual six years of team control, and he would get a big locked-in payday as a teenager, and also potentially a chance to still test free agency in his 20s. That's when players really get paid. Teams have shown they will pay top dollar for a player's peak years (not so much his 30s). \nFanGraphs projections give the Pirates at 43.2% chance to reach the postseason. They're at a point where every win they add to the roster would boost their postseason odds significantly. Griffin could flop. He could also be an enormous, season-swinging upgrade over Gonzales. Extension or no extension, putting him at short has to be a serious consideration. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe red-hot San Antonio Spurs are two wins away from completing a perfect month of February. They attempt to register the first one against a team with which they've had little problems of late.San Antonio (41-16) looks to improve to 10-0 in February when it visits Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday to take on the Toronto Raptors (34-24) at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Spurs, who haven't lost since dropping a 111-106 decision to the Charlotte Hornets on Jan. 31 and are just three games behind the Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder, play their final contest of the month Thursday against the Nets in Brooklyn.The current nine-game winning streak is San Antonio's longest since it recorded a 10-game run in April 2012. The Spurs have won four consecutive meetings with the Raptors, with three coming by double digits, including a 121-103 home triumph earlier this season.Five other games are on Wednesday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Boston Celtics (38-19) and Denver Nuggets (36-22) at 10 p.m. ET at Ball Arena in Denver. The Celtics also are sizzling as they have won four straight games and nine of their last 10 after improving to 3-0 on their four-game road trip with Tuesday's 97-81 victory against the Phoenix Suns.The NHL returns from the Olympic break with an eight-game slate, one of which has the Vancouver Canucks (18-33-6) hosting the Winnipeg Jets (22-26-8) at 10 p.m. ET at Rogers Arena. Both teams have struggled of late, with the Jets losing seven of their last 10 games (3-4-3) and the Canucks winning just three of their past 22 contests (3-16-3).There is an abundance of games on Wednesday's college basketball schedule, with one being an American Conference showdown between North Texas (16-12) and Charlotte (14-13) at 7 p.m. ET at Dale F. Halton Arena. The Mean Green have won four of their last five contests, while the 49ers are coming off a 68-56 victory against East Carolina on Saturday that ended a four-game losing streak.The Spurs are 7.5-point favorites against the Raptors in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Nuggets are 3.5-point favorites over the Celtics. The Capitals are -153 on the money line versus the Flyers and North Texas is a 1.5-point favorite against Charlotte.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Feb. 25. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchSpurs at RaptorsTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Toronto | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Raptors +7.5 (-109)The Spurs have defeated the Raptors by an average of 20.5 points during their four-game winning streak in the all-time series, with only one of those victories coming by fewer than eight. San Antonio has beaten its opponents by at least nine points in every contest during its current nine-game winning streak, with the last eight triumphs being by double digits. But even though the Raptors lost to the Thunder by nine points last night, the SportsLine Projection Model believes they'll keep it close against the Spurs as they cover the spread in 64% of its simulations.Celtics at NuggetsTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Denver | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics +3.5 (-111) | Expert: Derrick White Over 5.5 assists (-132, Mike Barner)The Celtics are riding a four-game winning streak during which they've defeated each opponent by at least 11 points. Even though Jaylen Brown (knee) did not play against Phoenix on Tuesday, Boston posted a 16-point victory. Brown is listed as questionable but is expected by many to be in the lineup versus the Nuggets, who have lost six of their last nine overall games and two of three at home. Even with Brown's status up in the air, the SportsLine Projection Model's simulations have the Celtics covering the spread 67% of the time. SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner (46-21, +2169 on his last 67 NBA player prop picks) feels Derrick White will be a solid contributor for the Celtics as the guard, who led the team with 22 points against the Suns, has recorded eight or more assists in eight of his last 10 outings. \nNHL best bets, where to watchJets at CanucksTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Vancouver | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Under 6.5 (-123)The Canucks are the worst defensive team in the NHL as they have allowed a league-high 208 goals this season. However, neither team in this matchup is an offensive force as Vancouver ranks 29th in scoring with 145 tallies while Winnipeg is 25th with 159. The Canucks have scored two goals in each of their last six games and the Jets have been held to fewer than three in six of their last nine contests. Even though three-time Vezina Trophy recipient and Olympic gold medal winner Connor Hellebuyck isn't expected to be in the crease for Winnipeg, the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see a high-scoring affair, as the Under hits in more than 64% of its simulations.CBB best bets, where to watchNorth Texas at CharlotteTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Charlotte, N.C. | TV: ESPN+\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Charlotte -106 | Expert: Charlotte +0.5 (-118, Larry Hartstein)The 49ers won nine of 11 contests before their four-game slide, which ended with Saturday's 12-point triumph over East Carolina. That victory came at home, where Charlotte is 7-2 against North Texas. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks head coach Aaron Fearne's squad will continue that dominance in the all-time series as its simulations have the 49ers winning 61% of the time. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein (5-0, +500 on his last five against-the-spread picks involving Charlotte) agrees, and he was able to get the 49ers -- who have covered the spread in each of their last three meetings with the Mean Green -- at +0.5 at BetRivers Sportsbook.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's not every day that a kicker makes headlines for his contract demands, but that's exactly what's happening this week with Brandon Aubrey. The Cowboys are trying to get a long-term deal done with their kicker and they're even willing to make him the highest-paid player ever at his position, but a deal hasn't gotten done because of Aubrey's asking price. The 30-year-old reportedly wants to be paid somewhere close to $10 million per year. On one hand, that's a totally absurd asking price, especially when you consider that it would be a 56% jump over the current highest-paid kicker in the NFL in Harrison Butker, who's making $6.4 million per year. To put that in perspective, that would be like Lamar Jackson trying to get a new deal that pays him $93.6 million per year, which would be a 56% jump over the current highest number for a quarterback. It's also an interesting asking price because of how much leverage the Cowboys' currently have in the situation. Since Aubrey is a restricted free agent, the Cowboys will have to place a tender on him if a long-term deal doesn't get done by the start of free agency on March 11. If the Cowboys place a second-round tender on him, that means that other teams will be able to make him an offer, and if he leaves, his new team will have to send a second-round pick to Dallas. If he stays in Dallas and plays under the second-round tender, that means he'd make $5.8 million for the 2026 season. If that happens, the Cowboys could hit him with two franchise tags in a row, so the next three years would look like this: \n2026 salary: $5.81 million (second-round tender)2027 salary: $6.97 million (franchise tag)2028 salary: $8.37 million (second franchise tag)If you're the Cowboys, there's no reason to meet his $10 million asking price because you essentially control him over the next three years at $7.05 million per year. If Aubrey leaves after being hit with a tender, then the Cowboys will get a second-round pick out of it (or a first-round pick if they were to use the first-round tender), so it wouldn't be a total loss. The Cowboys have historically played hard ball with several players, including Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb, before overpaying for them down the road, but that's not the case with Aubrey. The Cowboys have reportedly offered him $7.5 million per year, which seems more than fair. However, this is one of the few situations where it makes sense for both sides to be stuck in. \nWhy Aubrey's asking price is reasonableAubrey is arguably the most valuable kicker in the NFL and he wants to be paid like it. From his standpoint, it makes sense to ask for a price that the Cowboys likely won't pay because that all but guarantees that he'll get to test the waters of (restricted) free agency. Aubrey will get to see what his value is and if he doesn't like what he sees, he can go back to Dallas and sign for $7.5 million per year, because it's unlikely the Cowboys would pull their offer. Basically, this allows him to get the best of both worlds. If he leaves Dallas, it will be because another team was willing to meet or come close to meeting his $10 million per year asking price. So is he worth $10 million per year? I would say the answer is yes. The smartest front offices in the NFL understand the importance of kicking and if you need proof, just look at the last few Super Bowl teams. The Chiefs have played in three of the past four Super Bowls and they have the NFL's highest-paid kicker in Butker. The Eagles have played in two of the past four Super Bowls and they have the second-highest paid kicker in Jake Elliott ($6 million per year). Elliott has struggled in the regular season over the past two years, but he hasn't missed a beat in the playoffs and he's been one of the best postseason kickers in NFL history. \nSeahawks kicker Jason Myers came close to winning Super Bowl MVP this year after hitting a Super Bowl record five field goals in Seattle's 29-13 win over the Patriots. Myers is currently the eighth-highest-paid kicker in the NFL, but when he signed his most recent extension in 2023, he was the second-highest-paid kicker.  The teams that taking kicking seriously are the teams that spend money on the position or spend a draft pick on the position. Of the past 15 teams to draft a kicker, all of them have made the playoffs within two years of drafting the kicker. That's not to say that the kicker led them to the postseason, it just means that the smartest front offices are focusing on the position and the teams with the smartest front offices are usually the ones making it to the postseason.If you don't want to draft a kicker, which can be a crapshoot, then you need to pay big when one of the top ones becomes available and that's what's about to happen with Aubrey. \nFor Aubrey to be worth $10 million, that means someone has to be willing to pay him that much and there will almost certainly be at least one front office that will be willing to pull the trigger. Just consider these two situations: The Rams might have gone 15-2 with a better kicking situation last season. The Falcons probably would have won the NFC South with a better kicking situation in 2025.In scenarios like that, $10 million almost seems like a bargain (And on that note, we've got some potential landing spots for Aubrey here). The other thing working in Aubrey's favor is that he's the ultimate kicking weapon: \nIn just three seasons, he has already made more 60 yard field goals (6) than any other kicker in NFL history. Only one other active player has more than two and that's Matt Prater (3). During a Week 14 game against the Lions, he became the first and only player in NFL history to hit three field goals of 55 yards or more in the same game. Even in this era of long distance kicks, no one had ever done that until Aubrey came along. Aubrey has also been automatic from inside 50 yards. Sometimes, you'll have a kicker with a big leg who struggles with his accuracy, but that's not the case here. In 2025, there were 17 kickers who attempted at least 25 field goals from 50 yards and in. Aubrey was one of just two who hit 100% of their attempts (Ka'imi Fairbairn was the other), so he was automatic. In 2025, there were 12 field goals hit from 60 yards or more and Aubrey has three of them. Jacksonville's Cam Little was the only other player with more than one, so two players combined for five of the 12 kicks from 60 yards or more. Basically, if you have one of those two players, you have monstrous leg up on the competition and every NFL team should be looking to get a leg up. There seems to be a belief that every kicker is hitting from 60 yards in the current NFL, but that's simply not the case. Last season, there were only nine kickers who hit from 60 yards or longer and there were only four who hit from 63 or longer. Since Aubrey's first year in the NFL, there have only been 21 field goals of 60 yards or more and Aubrey has six of them. No other kicker has more than two. Kickers are certainly hitting 60-yard field goals at a higher rate, but they're still a rare occurrence, unless you're Aubrey. The Cowboys kicker is so good from that range that he's the only player in NFL history to hit from 60 yards in the first quarter of a game. What that tells you is that he's the only kicker playing right now who has the total trust of his coach to hit from that range. \nYou can point to his field goal percentage of 85.7% in 2025 and say he's struggling, but that's not really the case. He's just asked to do things that no other kicker is asked to do. Aubrey went 36 of 42 in 2025 with all six misses from 51 yards or longer (He went 10 of 16 from that range). Aubrey is so good that it almost works against him, because he gets sent out for more long-range kicks than anyone else. One of those six misses was from 68 yards, which would have tied the NFL record. He also has a 70-yard miss in his career. Despite those long misses, he's still the fifth-most accurate kicker in NFL history. If you only count field goals from 55 yards and in, Aubrey is the second-most accurate kicker in NFL history, so you get the close-range accuracy with the bonus of a guy who can hit long-range bombs on a regular basis. If anyone deserves $10 million, it's Aubrey. The more realistic scenario is that he ends up getting $8 million or $9 million per year, but he's going to eventually get paid and he's going to deserve every penny he gets. \nOne thing to remember with Aubrey is that he didn't start playing in the NFL until he was 27. He's now 30 years old and he's only likely only going to get one or two long-term deals, so it makes even more sense for him to make sure he's getting top dollar with this deal. When you're the best at something in the NFL, you need to make sure that you're paid like the best and that's what Aubrey is trying to do here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's no guarantee J.J. McCarthy will start at quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings during the 2026 season, that revelation coming this week from executive vice president of football operations Rob Brzezinski, who said at the NFL combine the franchise is are \"exploring all possibilities\" at the position.The Vikings watched eventual Super Bowl champion Sam Darnold sign with the Seattle Seahawks as a free agent last March after hitching their wagon to McCarthy, a former 2024 first-round pick who was inconsistent during his first campaign as a starter.McCarthy finished with 1,632 yards passing, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions over 10 games, going 6-4 overall after missing his rookie season with a knee injury.\"What we do know is we need a level of baseline quarterback play for us to be effective,\" Brzezinski said. \"A lot of this has been J.J. in unfortunate (situations) with some of the injuries and things that he's dealt with, but we're going to explore every opportunity, and I don't think there's anything specifically we're looking for. We can't manufacture anything that's not there. So No. 1, what are the options? Is it reciprocal? Is it financially doable? All those things. There's just a lot of factors that go into it.\"\nNeither Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell, nor Brzezinski, endorsed McCarthy as Minnesota's expected starter during separate interviews in Indianapolis this week. O'Connell did say he felt like McCarthy, who missed the team's regular-season finale in January with a hand injury, could still be a franchise quarterback.O'Connell was previously a firm believer in the former Michigan standout to lead his offense after Minnesota selected him at No. 10 overall two years ago in the draft.\"It's just the timeline is in a different place for all of us than it was at that point,\" O'Connell said this week, via ESPN. \"And I have a responsibility -- we have a responsibility collectively as we put together this team -- to make sure that we use the data that we have at this time and the experiences we have, the feelings that we've had at different times as an organization.\"\nMcCarthy is signed through the 2027 on his four-year rookie deal which includes $21.8 million guaranteed. Brzezinski said the team was not\" ruling anything out\" with their plan at quarterback. Aaron Rodgers is a free agent, along with Malik Willis. There's an expectation Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray could be as well since he hasn't spoken with the team since the end of the season.The Indianapolis Colts have a decision to make with Daniel Jones. He's set to hit free agency unless the team franchise tags him or gets him to agree to a new deal.Each of these signal callers could be potential targets for the Vikings if they're not comfortable with moving forward with McCarthy as QB1 for next season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The title defence rolls on, but, in sharp contrast to 12 months ago, Paris Saint-Germain really do not feel like a team who are bound for the final. The dynasty might just be on pause for this season at least.If that seems a curious response to a 2-2 draw that took the holders beyond Monaco then ask yourself this question: how different might this tie have been if the young men from the principality had not contrived to get themselves sent off in the critical moments of both legs? For Aleksandr Golovin in the Stade Louis II read the previously exceptional Mamadou Coulibaly. When he careened into Achraf Hakimi in the 58th minute, Monaco were level in the tie and looked slightly more likely to find its seventh goal. Adi Hutter's side were doing a little with a lot: purposefully breaking out from their lines of five and four without the ball, exploiting the running power of Folarin Balogun out in the channels and getting players up in support of him. They might not have dominated possession -- who does against a Luis Enrique team? -- but they were getting into the right spots and doing with an energy that their illustrious hosts could not match.That is a real problem for PSG, who did get the job done quite swiftly after Coulibaly saw red. Desire Doue's cross from the byline was turned in by Marquinhos, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia pounced on the rebound when Philipp Kohn spilled a long ranger from Achraf Hakimi: these were partly a reward for the final third pressure the hosts applied with their man advantage but no less a reflection of a young opponent who'd had the stuffing knocked out of them by their reduction in numbers. \nxG race from PSG's 2-2 draw with Monaco, whose sending off came in the 58th minute \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            There might have been more in this for Monaco than they realised, Jordan Teze ghosting in at the back post to turn in almost unmarked in a fashion not dissimilar to the opener from Magnes Akliouche. On both occasions, PSG had the numbers to comfortably deal with the situation, and none of them seemed willing to take control of the season. That could scarcely be a greater contrast from last season, when intensity was the defining trait of this team. Luis Enrique's men would outrun anyone in Europe, and at this stage, their blend of quality and industry was shining through so clearly against Ligue 1 opposition that you suspected this was a different outfit to the many who had fallen short in the Champions League.Tonight, you half expected to see one of the old guard ambling around the field out of possession, waiting for the other guys to do the defending and get the ball up to them. It is becoming increasingly clear that PSG relied on Ousmane Dembele for more than just his clutch goals. It is hard to believe that the best pressing Ballon d'Or-level striker of his generation would have allowed Monaco to so easily work their way out of the counter press when PSG frequently gave the ball away in the Monaco half. \nThe issue here is that the 13 total starts Dembele has made this season is altogether more normal for him than the run of fitness he found 12 months ago. Good squad planning means having good cover for the players you know are most vulnerable. It's not entirely clear that a front three of Bradley Barcola, Doue and Kvaratskhelia, with Goncalo Ramos filling in here and there, is that.Dembele is not the only one who is feeling the burn. Fabian Ruiz was missing tonight; it is hard to find a cornerstone of that championship team who hasn't missed time. And that's not a surprise. This was a team coached to hit its peak on May 31, 2025. Then they had to play on for another six weeks and seven games. The Club World Cup exacted a heavy burden. Luis Enrique has tried to mitigate that with rest and rotation, but maybe that explains why so many basic passes were going awry.When they didn't, this was still a team that could run rings around better opponents than Monaco. There is something irresistible about PSG's left winger dragging the opposition out of position to create space for an underlapping Nuno Mendes to fizz in a low cross from the byline. Get Kvaratskhelia going at his man, and it's good night and good luck. Last season, PSG could manufacture those spots a dozen times a night. Now they are flashes of what once was.\nWhat they are now is not a team that exists at the same level as Arsenal and Bayern Munich, the two clear favorites to win this competition. It might not even be enough to get comprehensively clear of Barcelona or Chelsea, the two teams that they could get in Friday's draw. At this stage a year ago PSG seemed to have the momentum to push themselves to the heights they had always dreamed of. Now they are back to the crushing realities of what a team looks like when it doesn't have the energy to match its talent.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We all know the top prospects in this draft class. The likes of Fernando Mendoza, Jeremiyah Love, Carnell Tate, and Kenyon Sadiq will be selected early in the 2026 NFL Draft and will be expected to contribute early in their NFL careers. As we move further down the draft board, it becomes increasingly more difficult to find Fantasy stars of tomorrow, but it's certainly possible. The 2026 NFL Draft has been billed as one that'll likely be good for the trenches but not so much for skill positions. However, the more players I studied, the more players I found that I wholeheartedly believe will have a shot at becoming Fantasy contributors in Year 1. If the following players fail to show signs of life in their Rookie season, they'll at the very least be worth drafting and stashing in Dynasty leagues. QB, Taylen Green, ArkansasAs long as putting points on the board is the primary objective, Taylen Green should always be considered a quarterback prospect. As a true dual-threat quarterback, he's capable of putting the ball in the endzone with his arm and his legs. At 6-foot-6, 224 pounds, he's got the arm strength necessary to make up for being late on any down that requires him to make an off-schedule play. He's also got above-average athleticism for the quarterback position as he's expected to run the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds or lower. Look for Green to put on a show at the NFL Combine and place himself firmly on the radar of quarterback-needy teams ahead of the 2026 NFL Draft.  If he's able to sit and learn behind a veteran for a year or two, he could be the perfect player to draft and stash in Dynasty leagues.Comparison: Randall CunninghamPerfect fits: Las Vegas Raiders, Detroit Lions, Philadelphia Eagles, Indianapolis Colts\nHonorable mention: Drew Allar | Hayes King | Jalon Daniels | Diego PaviaAdam Randall, RB, ClemsonAdam Randall is a very intriguing prospect. At 6-foot-2, 233 pounds, Randall possesses a great deal of versatility. Coming out of high school, he was a four-star wide receiver prospect. He didn't make the full-time transition to running back until his final season at Clemson, when he rushed for 814 yards and 10 touchdowns and added another 254 yards and three touchdowns on 36 receptions. Despite his height, he actually runs quite well behind his pads, and thanks to his background at wide receiver, he's a mismatch for most linebackers and safeties. Due to his height, most defenders tend to go after his legs, and his legs do tend to go dead on contact. He'll need to get slightly stronger in his lower half to maximize yardage through contact to his lower half at the next level. With that said, I wouldn't be shocked to see him carve out a role for himself early in his NFL career. Comparison: James StarksPerfect fits: Baltimore Ravens, Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills,Rahsul Faison, RB, South CarolinaWhen it comes to patience and start-and-stop ability, there's no better running back in the 2026 NFL Draft than Rashul Faison. He truly understands what it means to be slow to and fast through the hole. He does a tremendous job of setting up his blocks, and he's got the ability to make defenders miss once he breaks into the open field. While he didn't put up big numbers at South Carolina, his 1,109 yards and eight touchdowns in 2024 at Utah State is proof that he's capable of taking on a three-down role at the next level. Faison will, in fact, be a 26-year-old rookie, so it would be in the best interest of any team that selects him to get all they can out of him now. With that said, the film says the juice is certainly worth the squeeze, and he has the talent to be a fine RB2.Comparison: Kevin SmithPerfect fits: New Orleans Saints, Pittsburgh Steelers, Tennessee TitansMike Washington Jr. RB, ArkansasIf there's any player whose Combine performance may cause teams to go back and take a second look at the film, it's Mike Washington Jr. Washington posted 1,070 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground and added another 226 yards and one touchdown on 28 receptions. At 6-foot, 228 pounds, Washington is much more explosive than he's given credit for in scouting circles. He's got a slashing running style with the speed to pull away from secondary defenders with ease. His acceleration is apparent on film, and while I'd love to see him get his pad level a little lower at or behind the line of scrimmage, he always seems to get his pads down just before contact. Washington may not be the best back in the 2026 Draft, but when it comes to upside, he's probably my favorite running back in this class. Expect his stock to soar with a stellar performance in Indy.\nComparison: DeMarco MurrayPerfect fits: Houston Texans, Cincinnati Bengals, Washington CommandersHonorable mention:Nick Singleton, Penn State | RB, Demond Claiborne, Wake Forest | Noah Whittington | Eli Heidenreich, RB/WR, NavyChris Brazzell II, WR, TennesseeUnfortunately, Tennessee wide receivers are getting a bad rap throughout league circles. The Volunteer offense tends to lean on a player's overall athleticism, as opposed to nuance and savvy at the wide receiver position. While Volunteer wide receivers haven't panned out in recent years, there's reason to believe Chris Brazzell could be different. Though he's 6-foot-5, 200 pounds, he has long speed and would be best suited as a \"Z\" receiver. The \"Z\" receiver or flanker is often positioned off the line of scrimmage and is frequently used in motion. Flankers are often granted a free release as a result of being positioned off the ball or used in motion, and that makes a player with Brazzell's size-speed combo that much more dangerous. If he happens to land in an offense that has an established No. 1 WR and utilizes a great deal of pre-snap motion, he could carve out a role as a deep threat early in his career.Comparison: DJ Chark Jr.Perfect fits: Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks, Dallas Cowboys, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nZachariah Branch, WR, GeorgiaAny team in need of a player who can take their short passing game to another level, they'll certainly want to consider Zachariah Branch. Many coaches call the short passes and screens as extended handoffs, and Branch is definitely a guy who will receive a great deal of them in the NFL. Many of his receptions were behind the line of scrimmage at Georgia. That will likely continue to be a theme early in his career, which makes him the perfect young receiver to take a flyer on in PPR leagues.  As he continues to round out his game, he'll be best suited in a West Coast offense that allows him to thrive as a runner after the catch. Thanks to his quickness and long speed, any coach worth his salt will quickly realize he's simply too explosive to keep on the sideline.Comparison: Marquise \"Hollywood\" BrownPerfect fits: Cleveland Browns | Miami Dolphins | Arizona CardinalsBrenen Thompson, WR, Mississippi StateThis is a receiver with real track speed. He's got a personal best of 10.18 in the 100-meter dash, and it is possible he leaves Indianapolis as the 2026 NFL Combine's fastest man. While Thompson is listed at 5'9 170, he should not be relegated to the slot. He has the quickness to win on the outside. Any defender who attempts to jam him with no help over the top could have a very long day. Due to his speed, many teams gave him a great deal of cushion, and I wouldn't be shocked if that were the case for him in the NFL as well. Brenen may need to add a little more muscle to his frame, but he's a player who is deserving of a lot more fanfare. Expect his draft stock to rise exponentially after this weekend. Comparison: Santana MossNFL fits: Kansas City Chiefs | Philadelphia Eagles | Carolina PanthersHonorable mention:Emmanuel Henderson Jr., WR, Kansas | CJ Daniels, WR, Miami | Bryce Lance, WR, NDSU | Antonio Williams, WR, Clemson\nMichael Trigg, TE, BaylorMichael Trigg has a massive catch radius and will be a great security blanket for a young or struggling quarterback. He can play above the rim and is the ultimate matchup nightmare. He's too big for most safeties, and he's too athletic for your average linebacker. He'll need to get bigger and work on improving his base to become a better blocker, but as it stands, he's the perfect \"move\" tight end.Comparison: Noah FantNFL fits: Houston Texans | New England Patriots | Denver Broncos Khalil Dinkins, TE, Penn StateDespite not being utilized much in the passing game, Dinkins' athleticism definitely stands out whenever the ball is thrown in his direction. Due to a lack of production, he'll need to make his presence felt during the Combine, and he certainly has the athleticism necessary to improve his draft stock. He has outstanding body control when the ball is in the air, and he does an excellent job catching the ball at its highest point. He's expected to be a Day 3 selection in the 2026 NFL Draft, but given his explosiveness and natural hands, I wouldn't be surprised to see him make a 53-man roster and carve out a role for himself late in the season. If he runs in the low 4.5 area in the 40-yard Dash, and looks the part in on-field drills, he's definitely worthy of a draft and stash in Dynasty leagues.Comparison: Chig OkonkwoHonorable mention:Oscar Delp, TE, Georgia | Dae'Quan Wright, TE, Mississippi | Eli Raridon, TE, Notre Dame | Jack Endries, TE, Texas\n            ",

The win was engineered by veteran quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who will remain Arizona's QB1 for at least the next four games after the team recently placed Kyler Murray on injured reserve. Arizona (3-5) is facing a red hot Seahawks team that bolstered their roster just before the NFL trade deadline when they acquired former Saints receiver/returner Rashid Shaheed. At 6-2, the Seahawks are trying to keep pace with the also 6-2 Rams in the NFC West standings. \nWhere to watch Cardinals vs. Seahawks liveWhen: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETWhere: Lumen Field -- Seattle, Washington TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -6.5; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Cardinals vs. Seahawks: Need to know The Cardinals \"new\" QB1. The 32-year-old Brissett has embraced his role as a veteran quarterback that is more than capable of stepping in at a moment's notice. In three games this season, Brissett has completed an impressive 65.2% of his passes with six touchdowns and just one interception. Tom Brady's former backup in New England, Brissett has 92 games and 56 career starts under his belt. Seahawks to work in new receiver. In Shaheed, the Seahawks are getting a 27-year-old playmaker who is still very much in his prime. This year, despite shaky quarterback play in New Orleans, Shaheed still managed to catch 44 passes for 499 yards and two touchdowns. He caught 6 of 9 targets for 33 yards during the Saints' Week 1 loss to the Cardinals. Seattle's \"other\" receiver. Shaheed should help open things up for new teammate Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who currently leads the NFL with 948 receiving yards. The former Ohio State standout has been on a tear lately; he averaged 136.5 yards per game and caught eight passes in each of the Seahawks' last four games. Speaking of receivers. Arizona has its own dynamic pass-catching duo in Marvin Harrison Jr. and tight end Trey McBride. Harrison's production has steadily picked up this season; he had seven catches for 96 yards and a score against the Cowboys. McBride also had a touchdown in Dallas and is the team's leader with five touchdown receptions. Defense, anyone? We've talked a lot about offense, but both teams have pretty good defenses, too. Arizona is currently 11th in the NFL in fewest points allowed and is also 10th in third down efficiency. Seattle's defense has been even better, as it is fifth in the NFL in points allowed, third in interceptions recorded, first in average yards-per-carry allowed and ninth in red zone efficiency. Cardinals vs. Seahawks prediction, pick \nArizona was competitive in each of its first eight games, and I expect that to again be the case on Sunday. But as was the case in five of their first eight contests, I'm picking the Cardinals to come up short once again. Seattle's defense is the main reason why I'm going with the home team. Specifically, Seattle's formidable pass rush may prove to be a big factor in Sunday's game. The fact that the Seahawks also boast the league's fifth-ranked scoring offense doesn't hurt, either. Pick: Seahawks -6.5; Under 44.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The 49ers, quarterbacked by Mac Jones, were 7.5-point underdogs, making it Shanahan's largest upset win as a coach. It looks like Jones will get the call under center once again as Brock Purdy continues to deal with a troublesome turf toe injury that has limited him to just two games this season.On the other side is a team that is absolutely rolling. Ever since the loss to the 49ers, the Rams have won three straight games, outscoring their opponents 86-20 over that span. Matthew Stafford has emerged as an MVP candidate, and the defense has more than held up its end of the bargain as well.Here's how to watch this NFC West showdown, as well as betting information, keys to the game and a prediction.\nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Rams liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Levi's Stadium -- Santa Clara, CaliforniaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -4.5; O/U 49.5 (via FanDuel)49ers vs. Rams: Need to knowMatthew Stafford is on an absolute heater. Over his last five games, Stafford has thrown for 16 touchdowns and zero interceptions. That included a 375-yard, three-touchdown game against the 49ers. Overall this season, Stafford leads the NFL with 21 passing touchdowns, and he is fifth in the league with 2,147 passing yards. Stafford has been tremendous surrounded by one of the best receiving duos in the NFL in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, who leads the NFL with eight receiving touchdowns. Nacua, it should be noted, is expected to be just fine for this game after exiting early with a rib injury in Week 9.Christian McCaffrey keeps 49ers offense moving. Purdy is one of several key players who has missed time this season. Defensive stars Fred Warner and Nick Bosa are out for the season, as is first-round rookie Mykel Williams. George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings have all missed time, and Brandon Aiyuk is yet to make his season debut. Yes the 49ers just keep on going, thanks in large part to McCaffrey, who leads the NFL with 1,222 yards from scrimmage. After missing much of last year, McCaffrey has returned to his normal workhorse status, and even though he hasn't been as explosive or efficient as in past years, he is on pace to become the first player with multiple seasons of 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards.Rams defense holding its own. For all the headlines Stafford, Nacua and Adams garner, the Rams' defense has been terrific. Los Angeles ranks in the top 10 in yards per play allowed, yards per rush allowed, net yards per pass attempt allowed, sack rate and third-down and red zone efficiency. Byron Young has nine sacks this year, already surpassing his previous career high, and Jared Verse is the other half of a fearsome pass rush.49ers vs. Rams pick, prediction\nEach of the last five games between these two teams has been decided by seven points or fewer, and expect that to continue this weekend. This time, however, it's the Rams sneaking out a narrow win, with Stafford and his top two targets making big plays to even the season series with their division rivals upstate. Pick: Rams -4.5; Over 49.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Lions have have gone 52 straight games without losing back-to-back contests since then and have won their last 12 games that followed a loss.They will be heavily favored to make that 13 straight given the condition of the Commanders currently. Washington (3-6) has come crashing back down to Earth after last year's stunning 12-5 record and trip to the NFC Championship Game. Reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels dislocated his elbow late in a Week 9 blowout loss to the Seahawks and will be out. His injury is one of several the Commanders have experienced this year, and Marcus Mariota will make his fourth start in place of Daniels this season.\nWhere to watch Commanders vs. Lions liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Northwest Stadium -- Landover, MarylandTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -8.5; O/U 48.5 (via FanDuel)Commanders vs. Lions: Need to knowLions look to get offense back on track. Jared Goff got sacked five times, and Detroit managed just 65 rushing yards last week. The Lions' 305 yards of offense represented their fifth consecutive game with 380 yards or fewer, their longest streak since 2021. Overall, the Lions have slipped to 11th in yards per game this season; they were second last year. Offensive coordinator John Morton, Goff and star running back Jahmyr Gibbs should have ample opportunities to get back on track, though. Washington is allowing over 410 yards per game over their past four games, the second-highest in the NFL.Aidan Hutchinson, rest of pass rush aim to get after Marcus Mariota. After signing a massive extension with the Lions last week, Hutchinson had a sack and seven pressures against the Vikings. He has seven sacks this season and will look to add to that total against a Washington offensive line susceptible to the pass rush. Washington quarterbacks have taken 24 sacks this season, tied for ninth-most in the NFL entering Week 10, and Mariota has taken multiple sacks in three of the four games he's seen significant action in this season.Washington trying to find bright spots. The Commanders have been outscored 135-67 during their four-game losing streak, the worst point margin in the NFL since Week 6. Not only is Daniels out, but so, too is Terry McLaurin as well as several other key contributors. At this point, Washington is hoping to find anything positive to take forward. Keep an eye on rookie right tackle Josh Conerly Jr., rookie cornerback Trey Amos and some other youngsters who will figure heavily into Washington's future as it plays out the string this season.Commanders vs. Lions pick, prediction\nThis one seems pretty straight forward. Washington has been one of the worst defensive teams in the NFL over the past several weeks, making this a perfect get-right game for Detroit. This was always going to be a tough challenge for Washington even if Daniels was healthy considering how poorly the defense is playing. Without him, victory is a near impossibility.

Miami is coming off a mini-bye following its 28-6 loss to the Baltimore Ravens last Thursday, while the Bills are riding high following a 28-21 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.The Dolphins moved on from general manager Chris Grier last week, but coach Mike McDaniel is expected to keep his job through the end of the season. Miami is off to its worst nine-game start under McDaniel, and just experienced the largest home loss of the McDaniel era last week (22 points). With that being said, the Dolphins were competitive with the Bills in Week 3.The Bills on the other hand appear to be surging following their Week 7 bye. Buffalo ran over the Carolina Panthers, 40-9, in Week 8, then Allen completed 23 of 26 passes for 273 yards and scored three total touchdowns against Patrick Mahomes last week. His 88.5% completion percentage vs. the Chiefs was the highest in a single game in franchise history. Let's break down this Week 10 showdown, but first, here's how you can watch the game. \nWhere to watch Bills vs. Dolphins liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -9.5; O/U 49.5 (via FanDuel)Bills vs. Dolphins: Need to knowAllen has had total domination over Dolphins. Allen likes facing the Dolphins, because he usually plays very well. The reigning MVP is 14-2 vs. the Dolphins lifetime, and he's been averaging 312.1 total yards and three touchdowns per game vs. Miami over his career. The three total touchdowns are the most averaged by any player vs. any opponent since 1950, and the 312.1 total yards per game are the second-most by a player vs. any opponent since 1950. Allen's 4,994 total yards and 48 total touchdowns vs. the Dolphins are the most by any player vs. an opponent before turning 30 since 1950. James Cook's impressive start. Last week, Cook snapped the Chiefs' 27-game streak without allowing a 100-yard rusher by scampering for 114 yards following a 216-yard outing vs. the Panthers the week prior. Cook's 857 rushing yards through eight games are the most by a Bills player since O.J. Simpson in 1975, and his 108.4 rushing yards per game lead the league. Is De'Von Achane one of the most explosive players ever? If the Dolphins are going to pull off this upset, running back De'Von Achane will be important. He has the sixth-most scrimmage yards (880) in the NFL this season, and you may be surprised to learn that his 5.42 yards per rush ranks No. 1 in NFL history among players that rush at least 10 times per game -- above even Bo Jackson and Jamaal Charles! Achane's 5.9 yards per touch (minimum 15 touches per game) also rank most in NFL history above Jahmyr Gibbs and Christian McCaffrey. Bills vs. Dolphins prediction, pick\nDespite being 14-2 vs. the Dolphins, did you know that Allen is just 7-8-1 against the spread vs. Miami? This line is also the largest spread McDaniel has faced as a home underdog. Still, I'm going to take Buffalo to keep rolling. The Bills have averaged 34 points per game in back-to-back wins after averaging 17 points per game in back-to-back losses. Pick: Bills -9.5, Under 49.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

A massive favorite, the Steelers watched the Chargers overcome a 10-point, fourth-quarter deficit to steal what appeared to be a sure trip to the Super Bowl for the black and gold. Sunday night has all the makings of another highly-competitive game between these two teams. The Steelers will head to Los Angeles with a 5-3 record after dispatching the Colts last week in Pittsburgh. At 6-3, the Chargers are looking to keep pace with the Broncos who moved to 8-2 with a victory over the Las Vegas Raiders Thursday night. Plus the Chargers still have to visit Kansas City to face a rejuvenated Chiefs team. \nWhere to watch Steelers vs. Chargers liveWhen: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETWhere: SoFi Stadium -- Inglewood, California  TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers -3; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Steelers vs. Chargers: Need to know Recent rematch. These teams faced each other a little over a year ago in Pittsburgh. The Steelers won that game, 20-10, on the strength of a defense that held the Chargers to just 10 first downs and 166 total yards. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin acknowledged this week that his team faced a physically compromised Justin Herbert that day, as Herbert played through a considerable ankle injury for most of the game before exiting the contest in the second half. Key injury. The Chargers recently lost another notable player when starting offensive tackle Joe Alt suffered a season-ending ankle injury during last week's win over the Titans. Los Angeles is now without both of its starting offensive tackles after losing Rashawn Slater to a season-ending injury back in August. New Steelers secondary. Tomlin said this week that Jalen Ramsey will be exclusively at free safety while playing alongside new starting strong safety Kyle Dugger. Dugger played in all but one of the Steelers' defensive snaps last week despite joining the team just days before Pittsburgh's win over the Colts. Big game for Warren? Pittsburgh struggled to run the ball vs. the Colts, but on Sunday, they'll be facing a Chargers defense that is 27th in the NFL in average yards-per-carry allowing 4.9 yards. This could mean good things for Jaylen Warren, who is three weeks removed from his lone 100-yard rushing performance this season. Red zone showdown. It'll be interesting to see which units steps up when Pittsburgh's offense enters the red zone against Los Angeles' defense. Led by Aaron Rodgers, the Steelers' offense is seventh in the NFL in red zone efficiency this season. On Sunday night, they'll face a Chargers defense that is the fourth-best in the league inside their own 20-yard-line. Steelers vs. Chargers prediction, pick \nA pretty evenly matched game, the Steelers do have one statistical advantage that may prove to be a big key in the game. Pittsburgh's defense, seventh in the NFL in red zone efficiency, will face a Chargers offense that is just 26th in the NFL in terms of scoring touchdowns inside the opponents' 20-yard-line. If T.J. Watt and the rest of Pittsburgh's defense can force the Chargers to settle for field goals, it would go a long way towards a possible upset. Pick: Steelers +3; Over 44.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Browns sit at 2-6 and last in the AFC North, while the Jets are 1-7 and also last in their division, the AFC East.While neither team is having an incredible season, which is putting it mildly, some changes both squads made prior to last week's trade deadline could have big impacts on not just this game but the rest of the season. The trade deadline move that shook up the league was the Jets sending the 2022 No. 4 overall pick Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts. They also sent their 2019 No. 3 overall pick Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys.Leading up to the game, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski announced that for the second-straight year, he will be giving up play-calling duties to his offensive coordinator, Tommy Rees.\nWhere to watch Browns vs. Jets liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: MetLife Stadium -- East Rutherford, New JerseyTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Browns -2.5; O/U 37.5 (via DraftKings)Browns vs. Jets: Need to knowWho'll be Jets' QB1? During Monday's press conference, coach Aaron Glenn wouldn't say if Justin Fields or Tyrod Taylor would be the starter for Week 10. Glenn did compliment Fields' 244 yard, one touchdown performance against the Bengals, saying the QB \"did a hell of a job\" against them. Taylor is 0-1 in starts this year, losing to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It'll be a new New York defense. The Jets defense will look a lot different without Gardner and Williams. New York wasn't winning games even with the two All-Pros and decided that investing in their future was more important than their present. Their defense had been allowing the fifth-fewest passing yards up to this point and so it will be interesting how their approach and effectiveness in shutting down opposing offenses looks without their two former stars. Both teams are coming off byes. Both teams had a chance to have a much-needed reset in Week 9. The Jets last game was their first win of the season, when they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 39-38. Can New York recapture that momentum and start a winning streak? The Browns most recent contest was a 32-13 loss to the New England Patriots.Browns vs. Jets prediction, pick\nConsidering the struggles that exist on both sides, this is a difficult one to pick.

    "body": "\n        We're now entering the most crucial phase of the Serie A season after an exciting start of the campaign that didn't see a team dominating the others as it often can happen and as is happening elsewhere in Europe. Arsenal are at the top of the Premier League standings with a six-point margin, Real Madrid are five points ahead of Barcelona in Spain while Bayern Munich are also five points ahead of RB Leipzig. In Italy, things couldn't be tighter at the top. Napoli currently lead Serie A with 22 points, followed closely by three teams on 21 (Inter, AC Milan, and AS Roma) while Juventus and Bologna sit just four points behind the league leaders. Everything is on the table, and all the top teams can concretely hope to win the Scudetto this season. Here's the main reason why each of them will and won't win the title.Napoli - 22 points Why they will win: Antonio Conte's side won the Scudetto last year and are still the main candidates to win again this season despite some key injuries that are affecting the roster, such as the most recent one to Kevin de Bruyne, who will miss at least three months of action. With their experience and Conte's winning mentality, Napoli have all the elements to stay at the top and fight for another Scudetto.Why they won't win: Injuries might affect the team in the long term and playing the Champions League this season is affecting the performances of the team in both domestic and European leagues. After focusing on just one game per week last season, things are quite different this year. Playing every three days has made it difficult for Conte to rotate his squad, especially with the current injury issues.Inter - 21 pointsWhy they will win: Cristian Chivu's team are now in a great form and after a challenging start the new coach was able to transform the way Inter are playing. Inter, after losing last season's title on the last matchday of the championship, will have a sense of revenge against Napoli and probably have the most experienced roster in the Italian Serie A to make it happen. \nWhy they won't win: The lack of experience for the Romanian coach in his first year with Inter can have an impact on the performances of the team in the long run, especially if we compare it to his rivals such as Antonio Conte, Massimiliano Allegri or Luciano Spalletti. Chivu is showing to be a great manager, but he will also need time to make some mistakes that will help him in the future. On top of it, Inter were able to play two Champions League finals in three years under Simone Inzaghi, and despite the great European runs were only able to win one Serie A title in four years. AC Milan - 21 pointsWhy they will win: The Rossoneri started off a new cycle under Massimiliano Allegri this summer and so far it's working perfectly. AC Milan can repeat what Napoli have done in the past season, when Conte's side focused on the league as they were not playing European soccer and helped them to win the title in his first year at the club. All the other teams are competing in Europe, and ironically, that could turn into an advantage for Allegri's side in the long run.Why they won't win: At the same time, AC Milan's summer revolution will take some more time to arrive where Allegri wants and the experience of teams like Napoli and Inter can become a factor. The Rossoneri are also lacking a true central striker who can lead the line effectively, despite featuring both United States men's national team star Christian Pulisic and Rafael Leao in their attack.\nAS Roma - 21 pointsWhy they will win: Gian Piero Gasperini's side start of the season has been really promising and the last time the Giallorossi won the Scudetto was in 2001, meaning there is a lot of pressure for him to succeed. At the same time, if Roma enter the spring within close reach of the Serie A leaders, they could find an additional source of motivation to make a serious title run.Why they won't win: This is only the first season under the new coach and it's probably too early for them to compete against the other teams to win the Scudetto. AS Roma are in the process of rebuilding under former Atalanta manager Gian Piero Gasperini, but they don't yet appear to be at the same level as their main rivals. Some of the new signings, such as striker Evan Ferguson and winger Wesley, have also struggled to meet the expectations so far.Bologna - 18 pointsWhy they will win: Compared to the rivals Bologna are the ones with the least pressure on their shoulders and they are also the only team with Napoli that kept the same coach from last season, something that can definitely help them in the long term. \nWhy they won't win: Despite playing exciting soccer and scoring some key wins in the first part of the season, their roster is not comparable to the ones of Napoli or Inter, for example. They are also playing Europa League, which doesn't help Vincenzo Italiano to rotate his players as much as he wants ahead of the key Serie A games. Juventus - 18 points Why they will win: The Bianconeri had a disappointing start of the season under Igor Tudor but the club decided to sack the Croatian manager and hired Luciano Spalletti, one of the most experienced managers available. His work ethic and tactical knowledge can help this team to improve in the short term, and Juventus are not far away from the top of the standings. Why they won't win: It's always difficult for a new manager to come in once the season is underway and implement drastic changes. Spalletti will likely need time to adapt the current squad to his tactical vision but time is exactly what he doesn't have.\n            ",

This is an AFC vs. NFC battle between two top teams in their respective conferences. The Patriots sit atop the AFC East, while the Buccaneers lead the NFC South.New England is coming off a 24-23 win over the Atlanta Falcons that extended their win streak to six games. It wasn't quarterback Drake Maye's best game and it will take a better showing to defeat Tampa. The Patriots have been praised for their quick turnaround by some, while others are hesitant to give them credit until they can beat more top teams. If New Engalnd can defeat Tampa Bay -- which is no easy task -- they'll quiet some of those doubters.The Buccaneers defeated the New Orleans Saints easily in their last game and the week prior fell to the Detroit Lions, 24-9. Tampa's other loss this season came to the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. Tampa Bay's defense knows how to pressure the quarterback and are a complete unit under coach Todd Bowles. The Bucs' blitz package is something a young quarterback, like Drake Maye, will need to anticipate.The Bucs are coming off a bye, so they have extra rest and time to prepare. Crucially, teams coming off a bye, when their opponent is not, are 6-0 so far this season.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Buccaneers liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium -- Tampa, FloridaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -2.5; O/U 48.5 (via DraftKings)    Patriots vs. Buccaneers: Need to knowBaker Mayfield vs. Drake Maye. Both quarterbacks are having stellar seasons. Mayfield has a 63.9 completion percentage (23rd), 1,919 yards (11th), 13 touchdowns (14th) against only two interceptions. Maye currently has a league-best 74.1 completion percentage, along with 2,285 passing yards (fifth), 17 touchdowns (tied for third) and just four interceptions. These quarterbacks are two of the most fun to watch in the league and who has the better game may be the difference maker on Sunday. Two solid rush defenses. Just like these teams are benefiting from solid quarterback play, both squads have notable defenses. The Patriots have allowed just 679 total rushing yards, which is best in the league. The Bucs have held their opponents to 741 yards on the ground, and that's sixth-best. The Patriots run game is middle of the pack, with 1,011 yards, eight touchdowns and 3.9 yards per carry, while the Bucs' comes in at the lower end of the spectrum, with 785 yards, six touchdowns and 3.8 yards per carry.How will the Buccaneers' injuries play a role? Wide receiver Chris Godwin (fibula) and running back Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) are among two players who did not practice on Wednesday. Godwin has played just two games this season, with the last coming on Oct. 5. Irving has played in four games this year and hasn't seen the field since Sept. 28.Patriots vs. Buccaneers prediction, pick\nI think fans are in for a treat with this one, as two playoff contenders from different conferences face off. I think this will be a close one that could come down to which team makes fewer mistakes. Pick: Patriots, Over 48.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim and Randy Brown took very different paths to their first UFC Fight Night main event. Bonfim is a relatively new addition to the UFC roster; meanwhile, Brown celebrates a decade with the promotion in January. They collide on Saturday night at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.Bonfim (18-1) is defending his ranking, but arguably has more to prove than his opponent. Bonfim became a top 15 welterweight off a controversial decision win over longtime contender Stephen \"Wonderboy\" Thompson. Two years ago, nearly to the day, he was knocked out by Nicolas Dalby. A close decision win over Brown, an unranked fighter approaching 10 years with the promotion, won't do him much good. Bonfim needs a standout performance.\"If I let Brown control the distance and keep the fight standing, he has an advantage, that's his game. But not with me,\" Bonfim told CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter. \" I'm very comfortable exchanging punches. I know he's afraid and weary of my ground game.\"\n        \n            \n                Jon Jones rips Tom Aspinall's skills after UFC 321: 'His wrestling and jiu-jitsu are incredibly overrated'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown (20-6) is determined to make the most of his first main event. He's a promising contender, but every time he builds steam, his momentum gets cut short by guys like Belal Muhammad, Jack Della Maddalena and Vicente Luque. But all that experience has given him a level head. Brown is coming off a KO win over Dalby, the only person to beat Bonfim, but he isn't putting much stock in it. Brown knows exactly what Bonfim did wrong, but he can't guarantee he'll make those mistakes again. \n\"I know exactly what he lost that fight and what happened. I can't assume he's in that same place. He was pushed, overwhelmed, got tired, and was stopped...\" Brown told CBS Sports. \"I can't bank on him making those same mistakes. For all I know, he's in the best shape of his life, and when he shows up he'll be ready to do 10 rounds.\" There isn't a lot to write home about on the undercard. Ricky Simon vs. Raoni Barcelos is solid matchmaking. Neither fighter is currently ranked, but they're veteran fighters who've mixed it up with the best. Simon notably holds a controversial win over reigning UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili and has fought former WEC champ Urijah Faber. Barcelos mixed it up with title challenger Umar Nurmagomedov in recent years.Below is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event.\n UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavorite Underdog Weight classGabriel Bonfim -190Randy Brown +160Welterweight  Joseph Morales -420  Matt Schnell +330  FlyweightUros Medic -150  Muslim Salikhov +125  WelterweightIsmael Bonfim -195Chris Padilla +165  LightweightRicky Simon -180Raoni Barcelos +150BantamweightMarco Tulio -185  Christian Leroy Duncan +155  Middleweight UFC Fight Night viewing information Date: Nov. 8 | Start time: 7 p.m. ET (main card) Location: UFC Apex -- Las Vegas TV channel: ESPN+ Prediction Gabriel Bonfim vs. Randy Brown: Don't let Bonfim's ranking fool you; he has something to prove. Many believe \"Wonderboy\" beat Bonfim. Dalby knocked him out. They were Bonfim's two most experienced opponents. Brown is another such veteran, having faced world-class competition for over a decade. He's fully capable of exploiting whatever holes Bonfim gives him, especially should he wilt over five rounds. Skill-wise, I lean towards Bonfim. He has fantastic submissions, judicious wrestling, and responsible striking defense. Thompson outstruck Bonfim in totality, but their significant strike outputs were almost identical. Last year, Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos took down Brown four times. The year before that, Della Maddalena submitted Brown -- one of only two submission wins in the champ's 20-fight pro career. There are conditions we should acknowledge in those two fights: Brown still beat Dos Santos, and Della Maddalena locked in the rear-naked choke off a knockdown. The fight benefits Brown the longer it goes. Ultimately, Bonfim shines more where Brown struggles. The inverse isn't quite as true. I'll take Bonfim, hesitantly, by submission. Bonfim via SUB2\n            ",

McCarthy's return from an ankle injury. The Ravens cruised past the Dolphins, 28-6, and are now 3-5 on the season after a 1-5 start. Lamar Jackson, playing for the first time since Week 4, threw for four touchdown passes. The Ravens had thrown for only one score in the previous three weeks when Jackson was out with a hamstring injury.Both teams will look to kick off the second half of their seasons with an interconference win and look to keep pace in the group of teams on the outside looking in on the current playoff picture. Here's how to watch the game, followed by odds, keys to the game and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Vikings vs. Ravens liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: U.S. Bank Stadium -- Minneapolis, MinnesotaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -4.5; O/U 48.5 (via FanDuel)Vikings vs. Ravens: Need to knowLamar Jackson has dominated NFC teams. Jackson leads the NFL in passer rating this season, and if the past is any indication, he should have another big performance Sunday. Jackson is 24-3 against NFC teams, the best interconference mark by a starting quarterback since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, and he has thrown 20 touchdown passes and just one interception in his last seven starts against NFC teams. Jackson's return also provided a boost for Derrick Henry, who had 119 yards rushing against the Dolphins, so the Minnesota defense will have its hands full.J.J. McCarthy looks to build on big win. McCarthy has experienced plenty of ups and downs to start his NFL career. After missing all of his rookie year due to a knee injury, he struggled for much of his NFL debut against the Bears before rallying the Vikings to an unlikely win. He then struggled again in a Week 2 loss to the Falcons and suffered a high ankle sprain. He missed Weeks 3-8 with that injury and returned in Week 9 with his best and most consistent performance. Though the 143 yards passing aren't that impressive, he made multiple big throws -- including two touchdowns -- and also ran for a score. He has multiple passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in two of his three career NFL games.Both defenses are improving. The Ravens were one of the NFL's worst defenses early in the season, but a pair of recent developments have helped. First, they've gotten healthy, with Roquan Smith, Marlon Humphrey and others returning from injury. Second, the acquisition of Alohi Gilman has allowed the Ravens to play with three safeties more often and move Kyle Hamilton closer to the line of scrimmage. The Vikings uncharacteristically struggled in consecutive losses to the Eagles and Chargers but got back on track in Week 9, by limiting the Lions' potent rushing attack to just 65 yards and sacking Jared Goff five times.Vikings vs. Ravens pick, prediction\nEven with improvements last week, the Vikings are allowing the sixth-most yards per play since Week 6, and now they're facing an offense back at full strength with Jackson in the fold. McCarthy looked more comfortable and confident in his return from injury, but the lack of explosiveness will make it hard for Minnesota to keep up with Jackson, Henry & Co. Pick: Ravens -4.5; Under 48.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Colts made a major defensive upgrade at the trade deadline in order to cement their status as contenders, and the Falcons need a win to stay in the NFC playoff race.Coming off just their second loss of the season, the Colts took a big swing on Tuesday when they sent a pair of first-round picks and receiver AD Mitchell to the New York Jets for cornerback Sauce Gardner. That was a big gamble, but it's one worth making for a team with Super Bowl aspirations. Indianapolis already has a top-two offense in the league, which is powered by star running back Jonathan Taylor and veteran quarterback Daniel Jones. That unit had a hiccup last weekend against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and it'll look to bounce back against the Falcons.Atlanta should be the more desperate team in this matchup as the team is now 3-5 and needs a win to keep pace in the NFC playoff picture. The Falcons missed an opportunity to pick up a huge win last weekend when kicker John Parker Romo missed what would have been a game-tying extra point late in the fourth quarter against the Patriots. Still, Atlanta has no shortage of weapons, especially on offense. Drake London just turned in a three-touchdown performance, and Bijan Robinson is one of the best running backs in the NFL.\nWhere to watch Falcons vs. Colts liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 9:30 a.m. ETLocation: Olympic Stadium Berlin -- Berlin, GermanyTV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Colts -6.5; O/U 48.5 (via DraftKings)Falcons vs. Colts: Need to knowNew weapon for Colts defense. On Tuesday, Gardner became just the second player since 1990 to get traded in exchange for multiple first-round picks. The other one was Jalen Ramsey, who went to the Los Angeles Rams in 2019. With a pair of first-team All-Pro selections in his first two NFL seasons, Gardner has already proven to be one of the best corners in the league. Gardner has missed time with a concussion, but he's on track to return for his Colts debut this week.Battle of the backfields. Expect both of these teams to feature their running backs early and often because they have two of the very best in the world. Taylor and Robinson are two of just three players with more than 1,000 yards from scrimmage this season. The last time two players with those numbers met in Week 10 or earlier occurred when Marshall Faulk and LaDainian Tomlinson faced one another in 2002.Falcons coming through as underdogs. The Falcons are the underdog in this one, and that's a role they've relished, at least against the spread. Atlanta is 3-0 against the spread as an underdog this season, which means the team is just 1-4 as a favorite. The problem for the Falcons is that not all of those covers have resulted in straight-up wins. They'll need to make sure they spring the upset this weekend in order to avoid falling into a 3-6 hole.Falcons vs. Colts prediction, pick\nDespite how good the Falcons have been as underdogs, I hesitate to take them in that situation this weekend given the travel and the fact that they'll get an angry Colts team coming off a rare loss. That said, the Indianapolis defense should get plenty of stops, even without Gardner fully up to speed with the scheme. The Atlanta defense isn't exactly a doormat either. Because of the defenses and the general body clock disruption, I think we get a low-scoring matchup. Pick: Colts -6.5; Under 48.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

They'll try to take another step toward the postseason as Jaxson Dart and the New York Giants come to town this weekend.Things are starting to come together for the Bears under first-year coach Ben Johnson. After an 0-2 start to the season, Chicago has won five of its last six, and the team gets a favorable matchup this weekend. In last week's win over the Bengals, Caleb Williams and Kyle Monangai were on fire. Williams totaled 333 yards to go with three passing touchdowns, and Monangai gashed Cincinnati for 176 rushing yards. The Giants defense may not be as bad as the Bengals, but it's not far off.Over the last three weeks, the story has been the same for New York. Dart looks good, but he doesn't have enough help around him to pick up the win. That was certainly the case in last week's loss to the San Francisco 49ers, in which Dart tallied 247 total yards and three total touchdowns. The other side of the ball was a problem for the Giants as they allowed 5.8 yards per play, and the 49ers were able to lean on the running game with a second-half lead. Can New York put together a more complete effort this week?Everything you need to know about what should be a fun game in Chicago can be found below.\nWhere to watch Giants vs. Bears liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Solider Field -- Chicago, IllinoisTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bears -4.5; O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings)Giants vs. Bears: Need to knowGiants have road woes. If you thought the Giants were bad at home, you would be right. The scary part is that it can -- and does -- get worse. New York has lost 10 straight road games, and the average margin of defeat in those games is 10.1. The Giants aren't even doing well by Vegas' expectations as they're 2-8 against the spread throughout this road skid.Caleb Williams is on a historic pace. The Bears have never had a quarterback top 4,000 yards in a single season, but that could change this year. Williams is now on pace for 4,071 passing yards this year, and now he gets to face a Giants defense allowing 232.1 yards per game. Williams should be able to put up numbers against this unit.Bears back in playoff picture. The Bears are very much in the playoff mix as they try to reach the postseason for the first time since 2020. Chicago (5-3) is still battling with the Detroit Lions (5-3) and the Green Bay Packers (5-2-1) for the top spot in the NFC North. According to FanDuel, the Bears' playoff odds are now +186.Giants vs. Bears prediction, pick\nSince Jaxson Dart took over as the starting quarterback in New York, the Giants offense has looked markedly better, despite some key injuries. Against a Bears defense that has surrendered 72 points over its last two games, the Giants should be able to find the end zone in this one. On the other side of the ball, the Giants have struggled to get stops, and the play caller matchup between Johnson and New York defensive coordinator Shane Bowen favors the Bears. I think this could be a shootout. Pick: Bears -4.5; Over 46.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Houston will face Jacksonville without starting quarterback C.J. Stroud, who entered the league's concussion protocol during last week's three-point loss to the Broncos. While Houston has more than one problem on its hand, this season has been much smoother for the Jaguars, who at 5-3 are within striking distance of the 7-2 Colts in the AFC South division standings. Jacksonville increased its odds at a postseason push when it acquired former Raiders wideout Jakobi Meyers just before the trade deadline. \nWhere to watch Jaguars vs. Texans liveWhen: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: NRG Stadium -- Houston, Texas  TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Jaguars -1.5; O/U 37.5 (via FanDuel)Jaguars vs. Texans: Need to know How will Stroud's replacement fare? With Stroud out, veteran Davis Mills is slated to make his first regular season start since the 2022 season. A 2021 third-round pick, Mills made 25 starts for the Texans during his first two NFL seasons and has a 2-1 career record against the Jaguars. While he played relatively well over that span, Mills as times struggled to take care of the ball. He threw a league-high 15 interceptions during the 2022 season, for example. Jaguars \"new\" wide receiver. While he's new to the Jaguars, Meyers -- who will turn 29 on Sunday -- is a seven-year NFL veteran who spent his first four seasons in New England before spending his last three seasons with Las Vegas. A model of consistency, Meyers had over 800 receiving yards each of the four seasons while tallying a career-high 1,027 yards last season. He had 33 catches for 352 yards and no touchdowns in seven games this season for the Raiders. Avoid Lloyd. Mills would be wise to avoid throwing in the direction of Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd. The 27-year-old Lloyd has a league-high four interceptions this season that includes two picks of Mac Jones during Jacksonville's Week 4 win over the 49ers. Speaking of defense. While their record leaves something to be desired, the Texans have nonetheless received mostly stellar play from its defense, led by defensive end Will Anderson Jr. On average, Houston is allowing 15.1 points per game, the fewest in the NFL. Record breaker. Jaguars kicker Cam Little is fresh off of his record-setting performance during last week's overtime win over the Raiders. Just before halftime, Little made history by booting a 68-yard field goal, the longest in NFL history by two yards. Jaguars vs. Texans prediction, pick \nIn a pretty evenly matched game, the Jaguars appear to have an advantage with the running game with Travis Etienne. After being underutilized in recent weeks, Etienne was given the ball a season-high 27 times during last week's win in Las Vegas. One would think that Jaguars coach Liam Coen will follow a similar script in Houston. If he does, the Jaguars should be enough to get a hard-earned win while improving to 6-3.

Carolina just sprung a huge upset against the Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field, and New Orleans just got shelled by the Los Angeles Rams.Anyone who thought about writing off the Panthers as playoff contenders can forget it because they just pulled off one of the most surprising results of the season with their 16-13 win over the Packers. Running back Rico Dowdle, who wrestled the starting job from Chuba Hubbard, has given the offense a little more juice. He went for 141 total yards and two touchdowns against a stout Green Bay defense. After an 0-2 start, the Panthers have rattled off five wins in their last seven games.On the other sideline, the Saints have been written off for a while now, and for good reason. They have one of the worst quarterback situations in the NFL, and that showed last week. In his first career start, Tyler Shough threw for 176 yards, one touchdown and one interception against a very good Rams defense. Shough faces a less difficult test this weekend, but he is down a key weapon after the Saints dealt receiver Rashid Shaheed to the Seattle Seahawks at the trade deadline.\nWhere to watch Saints vs. Panthers liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North CarolinaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Panthers -5.5; O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings)Saints vs. Panthers: Need to knowPanthers favored for this first time this season. The Panthers are the favorite in this matchup, and that marks the first time that has happened all season. In fact, Carolina hasn't been favored in this matchup since 2017 with New Orleans snapping a streak of 15 straight meetings as the favorite. It will be interesting to see how the Panthers handle a game that most everyone expects them to win.Saints' struggles against winning teams. The good news for Carolina is that New Orleans has been miserable against teams with winning records dating back to 2021. Since the start of that season, the Saints are 6-23 in 29 games against teams that are above .500. That includes an active nine-game losing streak.Rico running wild. Since Hubbard missed time with a calf injury earlier this season, Dowdle has seized the role and put up some monster numbers. In his three games as Carolina's starting running back, Dowdle has averaged 173 yards per game and 6.7 yards per attempt while finding the end zone three times. Dowdle's three games with 130 or more rushing yards are tied for the second-most in franchise history.Saints vs. Panthers prediction, pick\nThe Panthers haven't been a favorite all season, so there's no track record there. That makes me a little nervous, but how can I possibly bank on the Saints in this spot? Shough will be making his second career start, and the offense will be worse with the loss of Shaheed. Add in the fact that Dowdle should shred the New Orleans defense, and I could see the Panthers winning this one by a touchdown.

    "body": "\n        For his second straight tournament, Tommy Fleetwood will head into the weekend with at least a share of the 36-hole lead. The Englishman followed up his sensational 8-under 64 on Thursday with a 66 on Friday to maintain his overnight co-lead with fellow countryman Aaron Rai at 14 under halfway through the 2025 Abu Dhabi Championship.Among a pack of five to sleep on the lead after 18 holes, Fleetwood was the lone man to maintain his position atop the leaderboard. His playing partner the first two days, Shane Lowry, remains within shouting distance after a second-round 69 puts him at 11 under with players such as Nicolai Højgaard (-12) and Alex Noren (-10) rounding out the top 10.\"Really good day,\" Fleetwood said. \"I got off to, like, the perfect start -- birdie, birdie, birdie. That was good, especially when you've had a good round the day before. They always say it's hard to follow up a good round with another good one, or a low one with another one. \"Starting good was really important. I just did a really good job -- I hit a lot of good shots, but a few times today where I drove it into the rough and we read the lies really well. I felt like we did a great job of controlling the ball out of the rough, and that was really pleasing. I feel like I putted solid again. 6 under was a very good score.\"Fleetwood is projected to move up to No. 5 in the Race to Dubai standings should he hold on to the victory. It would mark his second straight trip into the winner's circle and the third in his last five worldwide starts dating back to his breakthrough win on the PGA Tour at the Tour Championship. \n\n        \n            \n                Rory McIlroy calls LIV Golf's decision to move tournaments to 72 holes 'a peculiar move'\n                \n                    Patrick McDonald                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt will not be given to him, however. Rai was spectacular in his own right on Friday at Yas Links. Shooting out of the blocks with an albatross on the par-5 2nd from 218 yards, the 30-year-old kept the momentum rolling throughout the entirety of his round and ultimately signed for a 64 tying for the low round of the day.\"Any time you hit close to 18 greens, you've had a good day out there, let alone 18,\" Rai said. \"The course is in incredible condition. If you hit a lot of fairways, it certainly gives you control. The green complexes are fantastic out here, as well, with being able to use the slopes, change your flights, change your shapes. It's a pleasure being out here and nice to play well, as well.\"The tournament leaderboard experienced some shuffling on Friday, but the season-long race remains where it started the week. Rory McIlroy backed up his opening 68 with another in Round 2 to sneak inside the top 20 at 8 under while his closest competitor, Marco Penge, matched his second-round score to remain one clear of him at 9 under. \n\"It's been great,\" Penge said. \"Obviously it's tough when you're both trying to beat each other. So I didn't want to get in the way too much or ask too many questions. But he definitely gave me a lot of time, and it was nice to walk the fairways with him and hopefully spend some more time with him in the future and learn a couple of tricks.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The presents have been cleared out from under the tree, and now college football bowl season has some more gifts to deliver with a trio of college football bowl games on Friday, Dec. 26. Northwestern takes on Central Michigan at 1 p.m. ET in the GameAbove Sports Bowl to begin the Friday college football action. Then, Minnesota squares off with New Mexico at 4:30 p.m. ET in the Rate Bowl, followed by UTSA vs. Florida International in the First Responder Bowl at 8 p.m. ET.Northwestern, Minnesota and UTSA are all favored in the latest college football odds, and the SportsLine projection model is backing all three favorites in its Friday college football best bets. Before locking in your college football picks, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model and team of college football experts. New users can also target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. College football best bets for Friday, Dec. 26 (odds subject to change): Northwestern (-10.5) vs. Central MichiganMinnesota (-2.5) vs. New Mexico UTSA (-5.5) vs. FIUCombining the model's three picks into a Friday college football parlay would result in a payout of +609 (risk $100 to win $609). Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Northwestern (-10.5) vs. Central Michigan Northwestern should have a significant talent advantage as a Big Ten school going up against a MAC program, despite a 6-6 record this season. Five of the Wildcats' six losses came in Big Ten play, though, and Central Michigan's one Big Ten matchup this season certainly didn't go well for the Chippewas. Central Michigan lost to Michigan, 63-3, in September. Northwestern was significantly more competitive in its matchup against the Wolverines this season, losing 24-22 in November. Central Michigan is coming off a 21-3 loss to Toledo in its final MAC game as well. The model projects Northwestern to win in 54% of simulations. Back Northwestern at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:Minnesota (-2.5) vs. New Mexico Minnesota closed its season with a 17-7 win over Wisconsin to finish 7-5, including 5-4 in the Big Ten. New Mexico went 9-3, but the competition in the Mountain West doesn't compare to the Big Ten as a whole. Even though New Mexico went 6-2 in the Mountain West, four of those six wins came in one-score games. The Gophers should have the talent advantage, and they've been unbeatable in bowl games under head coach P.J. Fleck. Literally unbeatable. Minnesota is 6-0 in bowl games over Fleck's first eight years as head coach, and that's a trend the model expects to continue on Friday. The model projects Minnesota to win in 63% of simulations. Back Minnesota at FanDuel, where new users get $250 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:UTSA (-5.5) vs. FIU UTSA has a top-20 offense in college football this season, ranking 19th at 32.5 points per game this season. The Roadrunners' offense is orchestrated by a familiar last name for football fans, with Owen McCown as the team's QB1. McCown is the son of Josh McCown, who had a 16-year NFL career at quarterback. Owen McCown threw for 2,700 yards, but he wasn't a one-man show. Running back Robert Henry Jr. rushed for 1,045 yards on 6.9 yards per rush, which ranked ninth in college football. Meanwhile, Florida International is allowing 29.5 ppg this season, which ranks 90th in the nation. The model projects UTSA to cover in 60% of simulations. Bet UTSA at FanDuel, where new users get $250 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Want more Friday college football picks?You've seen the model's college football best bets for Friday's bowl games.

Even with some notable quarterback injuries removing notable names like Patrick Mahomes, Jayden Daniels and J.J. McCarthy from the NFL DFS player pool, the slate is still loaded with high-quality options to target for NFL DFS lineups. Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Jahmyr Gibbs, Justin Jefferson and Travis Kelce are just some of the stars you could consider for your daily Fantasy football lineups.Big names, however, come equipped with big price tags, so you'll have to find balance with more affordable players as well. Those aforementioned QB injuries could make the likes of Josh Johnson, Chris Oladokun or Max Brosmer value-based Christmas NFL DFS picks. Before making any NFL DFS picks for Christmas, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Prescott going over 1.5 passing touchdowns using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

Gibbs ranks third amongst all running backs in Fantasy points for the second straight season. He ranks eighth in scrimmage yards (1,662) and second in total touchdowns (17) ahead of a matchup with a team he has historically dominated. Gibbs has nine touchdowns in five career games versus Minnesota while averaging 97.6 scrimmage yards. The Vikings have also been unable to stop any RBs from hitting paydirt recently as each of the last six offensive TDs that Minnesota has allowed have been to running backs. See who else to roster at SportsLine.You can also bet on Gibbs to go Over 113.5 rushing + receiving yards at DraftKings:\nAnother one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Cowboys wideout George Pickens ($8,800 on FanDuel, $7,300 on DraftKings), who is coming off a 7-130-1 stat line and ranks third in the NFL with 1,342 receiving yards on the season. He's been as consistent as any receiver and has at least 78 yards or a touchdown in 12 of 15 games.

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is the championship matchup in a vast majority of Fantasy football leagues, so it's the biggest week for Fantasy lineup decisions of the year for those who have made it thus far. In 2024, the players who had starred all year also showed up in the penultimate week as Joe Burrow, Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry and Trey McBride were among the stats leaders. This year, it's the likes of Josh Allen, Jonathan Taylor and Puka Nacua who have excelled and remain must-starts as Week 17 Fantasy football picks.As for your Fantasy football start/sit decisions, targeting players on teams with something to play for that are facing teams out of playoff contention could be the way to go. So, the likes of Jaylen Warren, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Stefon Diggs may find themselves a bit higher in the Week 17 Fantasy football projections than expected. Some NFL injuries of note to consider for Fantasy include J.J. McCarthy (hand) being out and Lamar Jackson (back) and Jordan Love (concussion/shoulder) being day to day.Before setting your Week 17 Fantasy football lineups for championship matchups, be sure to check out the Week 17 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 17 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $250 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 17 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 17: The model is fading Jags wideout Brian Thomas Jr., a Pro Bowler last year who finished third in receiving yards. Thomas, who is owned in almost all leagues being started in nearly half of them, has been a top-25 Fantasy receiver over the last three weeks, but this has been his best stretch all season as inconsistency has defined his sophomore year. He had a season-low of 18 yards last week, as both Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers have passed Thomas in the eyes of Trevor Lawrence, as those two are averaging more receptions and yards over the last month. Thomas may not warrant a spot in Week 17 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in wide receiver rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Rams tight end Colby Parkinson, despite him being the TE22 on the season and being started in just 38% of leagues this week. Parkinson has quietly performed as the TE6 since Week 10 as he's made the most of Tyler Higbee going on injured reserve. The former has six touchdowns over his last seven games while averaging 35.9 receiving yards over this stretch. He should continue that success on Monday night versus a Falcons defense which just allowed 11 catches and 118 yards to the tight end position on Sunday, which came a week after giving up a tight end touchdown.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Christmas best bets at DraftKings SportsbookLions vs. Vikings: Over 43.5 total pointsLakers vs. Rockets: Over 229.5 total pointsChiefs (+13.5) vs. BroncosCombining the model's three picks into a Christmas parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +605 (risk $100 to win $605). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nLions vs. Vikings: Over 43.5 total points (-105)\"The Lions come in needing a win to stay alive, and I expect them to move the ball against the Minnesota defense, as they had 30+ points in four straight against Brian Flores' unit before only scoring 24 earlier this year,\" SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White said. \"Getting to the Over will depend on how well Minnesota moves the ball, and the Detroit defense, with its secondary injuries, has been awful of late, with seven of eight games since the bye getting to 50 points and four up to 60-plus. Max Brosmer didn't look as lost in relief duty last week and even had some rapport with Justin Jefferson, so this is a game where I see both teams getting into the 20s.\"  Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Lakers vs. Rockets: Over 229.5 total points (-110)Each of the Lakers and Rockets games on Tuesday went Over this total, with both teams displaying awful defense in lopsided losses. The Lakers allowed 132 points to the Suns, while the Rockets allowed 128 points to the Clippers. The Rockets have allowed at least 125 points in four of their last five games, while the Lakers have allowed at least 132 points in three of their last five games. Both teams feature elite offensive playmakers, such as Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Kevin Durant, leading the model to project the Over to hit in 65.1% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Chiefs (+13.5) vs. Broncos (-112)Yes, the Chiefs are down to their third-string quarterback, but they still have Andy Reid as the playcaller and offensive guru to get the most out of Chris Oladokun. The seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft didn't look completely lost in his relief of Gardner Minshew, who left with a knee injury, last week. Oladokun completed 11 of 16 passes for 111 yards. The Chiefs won't want to be embarrassed against a rival in front of a huge audience, and although the Broncos are 12-3 on the season, they haven't dominated teams they were expected to. Denver has one-score wins against the Titans, Jets, Giants, Commanders and Raiders this season, and only two of their wins all season have come by more than one score. The model projects the Chiefs to cover in 60% of simulations. Back the Chiefs at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NFL and NBA picks for Christmas?You've seen some of the model's Christmas best bets.

    "body": "\nMaking NFL picks always carries a bit more excitement when there's something on the line, and that's the case with the Week 17 NFL schedule. No less than half a dozen matchups carry postseason implications for both teams, making them ideal ones to target with Week 17 NFL bets. Among those are Texans vs. Chargers (-1.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) and Ravens vs. Packers (-3) on Saturday, then Jaguars vs. Colts (+6.5), Seahawks vs. Panthers (+7) and Eagles vs. Bills (-1) on Sunday afternoon.Then on Sunday night, the 49ers are 3-point home favorites over the Bears, per the Week 17 NFL odds. If a rest edge matters to you, then you may want to back the Bears with Week 17 NFL predictions as Chicago's coming off a Saturday game, while San Fran is coming off a Monday game. All of the updated Week 17 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 17 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 17 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 17 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 17 NFL picks is that the Steelers (-3, 33.5) cover versus Cleveland on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh has rolled off three straight wins -- and three straight covers -- to control its own destiny to claim the AFC North. Meanwhile, Cleveland fought valiantly in its loss to the Bills on Sunday, but the Browns are now 0-4 straight-up and 1-3 ATS over the last month. Shedeur Sanders has brought excitement to the Browns but not necessarily many winning plays as no player has more turnovers (seven) than Sanders since he became starter in Week 12. Pittsburgh capitalizes off taking the ball away as the Steelers have covered in six straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. The model has Pittsburgh prevailing versus the spread nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 17 NFL predictions: the Bengals (-7, 53.5) cover against the Cardinals in a 1 p.m. ET kick on Sunday. Both teams are out of the playoff picture, but Cincinnati is in much better form overall. The Bengals have won two of their past four and have covered in four of their past five. The Cardinals, meanwhile, have dropped seven straight and are just 1-6 against the spread during that span. In addition to backing the Broncos, the model also says the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bengals to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 17 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 17 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams that outright win nearly 70% of the time, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 17 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which seven picks should you lock in now?

They played each other on Christmas as members of the Heat and Thunder. They did so again when James moved to the Cavaliers and Durant joined the Warriors. When James flew West for Hollywood, he faced Durant's Warriors in yet another holiday showdown. Were it not for an injury, Durant would have joined his Nets against the Lakers in 2021. Now, we're here again. The Lakers and Rockets represent the fifth unique matchup of their teams on Christmas Day.Well... \"their\" teams isn't quite the descriptor it used to be. While James and Durant are still stars, they are now supported but younger marquee players. This isn't just James vs. Durant. It's Luka Dončić vs. Alperen Sengun. It's Austin Reaves vs. Amen Thompson. It's two of the Western Conference elite slugging it out with major playoff standing implications at stake.So let's prepare for one of the best games on the Christmas slate with some best bets. Below are our picks against the spread and for the game's best prop bet.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRockets at Lakers: Where to watchTime: 8 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Crypto.com Arena -- Los AngelesTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Rockets -3, O/U: 230.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Rockets at Lakers: Prediction, odds, best bets\nThe Lakers are very banged up right now. Luka Dončić missed Tuesday's game. DeAndre Ayton just came back from a brief injury absence. So did Austin Reaves, and LeBron James is nearly 41, so it's safe to assume he's never quite at 100% anymore. That's exactly where you don't want to be heading into a matchup against the ultra-physical Rockets. The Lakers have had trouble with bigger, athletic teams all season. That's their weakness. Until they prove that they can overcome it, I'm expecting the Rockets to bully them in this one. The Pick: Rockets -3\nThe Lakers have holes all over their defense, but nowhere is it more glaring than in the backcourt. They are incredibly vulnerable against smaller, fast guards, and only the Clippers and Jazz are allowing a higher 3-point percentage on above-the-break 3s. In other words, I'm expecting the Lakers to build their game-plan around stopping the Rockets in the paint, and in the process Reed Sheppard will have a field day from deep. The Pick: Reed Sheppard Over 2.5 3s\n            \n    ",

The Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets were built by the same general manager, Tim Connelly. They faced off in the 2024 playoffs, where Minnesota ended Denver's championship defense with a second-round upset. Every year, they seem to play in a thriller or two. Last year, the Timberwolves stole a double overtime victory on a terrible Russell Westbrook shooting foul.Neither team is quite at its peak. Denver is still dealing with injuries to Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun. Minnesota is still adjusting to life without Nickeil Alexander-Walker. But these are still both Western Conference contenders, and any game between the two of them is a deserving marquee regular-season event. Below is our pick against the spread as well as the best prop bet for the Christmas finale.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTimberwolves at Nuggets: Where to watchTime: 10:30 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Ball Arena -- DenverTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Nuggets -3.5, O/U: 238.5 (via BetMGM) Timberwolves at Nuggets: Prediction, odds, best bets\nDenver's depth has improved significantly this season, but the injuries are just becoming too much to overcome against a great opponent like Minnesota. Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun are still out, and on Tuesday, Cam Johnson suffered a knee injury that we don't know the extent of yet, but should leave Denver without a third starter for at least some period of time. The Timberwolves always get up for Nuggets games and they've now won 10 of their last 12, including statement wins over the Knicks and Thunder. They're the safer pick with the points. The Pick: Timberwolves +3.5\nI'll admit my instinct was to pick Nikola Jokić's scoring over to account for his missing teammates, but no team limits his shot total better than Minnesota. Outside of his 61-point gem last season, which came without Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. and took two overtimes, Jokić has averaged just 15.4 shot attempts per game against Minnesota over the past two regular seasons. So I'm going the other way and expecting a more balanced offensive night for the three-time MVP. The Pick: Jokić Under 29.5 Points\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        You've heard of \"Elf on the Shelf,\" but have you heard of \"Snoop on the Stoop?\" Yes, for those wondering, it is a real thing and involves a plush of rapper Snoop Dogg dressed as an elf. From creating his own Christmas tradition doll, to making his own version of holiday stories, the hip-hop legend is becoming a Christmas legend and that legacy continued with an NFL halftime show on Thursday. Titled \"Snoop's Holiday Halftime Party,\" the 54-year-old took the stage at U.S. Bank Stadium during the break in the Christmas Day game between the Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions. Martha Stewart, a longtime friend of Snoop Dogg, introduced the rapper with a Snoop-ified Christmas story. The performance began will chants of \"Minnesota knows how to party.\"\nSnoop Dogg, dressed in an all red outfit, performed a number of his biggest hits and welcomed some special guests across numerous genres. There were background singers, dancers, nutcracker dancers, sleighs and a giant \"Snoop on a Stoop\" decoration.\nHe began with a hip-hop classic, \"The Next Episode,\" before switching gears to a performance of \"My Favorite Things,\" to bring some holiday music in the mix, a theme the show would continue to follow.After the holiday tune, he went back to his own discography with \"Nuthin' But A 'G' Thang.\"The singers of the hit Netflix movie K Pop Demon Hunters, EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami, gave their rendition of \"12 Days of Christmas.\" The rings in that song are \"gonna be, gonna be golden.\"\nFor his last two original songs of the show, the West Coast rapper hyped up the crowd with \"Drop it Like It's Hot\" and \"Who Am I (What's My Name).\"Country star Lainey Wilson was introduced and performed \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" on a light-up sled, with Snoop nearby dancing to her rendition.Italian singer Andrea Bocelli and his son Matteo Bocelli wrapped up the show with \"White Christmas\" and the rest of the performers joined them at the end of the song.\n\"NFL, Netflix and your uncle Snoop on Christmas Day? We're servin' up music, love and good vibes for the whole world to enjoy. That's the kind of holiday magic Santa can't fit in a bag,\" Snoop Dogg said ahead of the performance.Before the game, award-winning artist Kelly Clarkson kicked things off with her hit \"Underneath the Tree.\"\nThis marked the second year of Netflix broadcasting an NFL game on Christmas. Last year, the halftime show was performed by Beyoncé during the Ravens-Texans game in Houston. The performance, called the \"Beyoncé Bowl,\" received four Emmy nominations. \nThe Lions currently sit at 8-6 and are third in the NFC North, while division rival Vikings sit at 6-8 and in last place in the NFC North. Minnesota has been eliminated from the playoffs, but Detroit still has a fighting chance. The Christmas Day games are broadcasted on Netflix and are airing on CBS affiliates in the competing team's cities.\n            ",

The pact includes a club option for an eighth year and escalators that can push the total value to $131 million.Soderstrom, 24, is coming off a breakout season. He hit .276/.346/.474 with 25 home runs and 93 runs batted in. His contributions were worth an estimated 4.3 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations.Soderstrom's 126 OPS+ ranked third among A's regulars, behind first baseman and American League Rookie of the Year Award winner Nick Kurtz and catcher Shea Langeliers. The A's ranked sixth in the AL in runs scored, trailing five playoff teams: the New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, and Detroit Tigers.Soderstrom, who was already under team control through the 2029 season, is now in possession of the largest contract in Athletics franchise history. That distinction previously belonged to right-hander Luis Severino, a free-agent signing from last winter who inked a three-year pact worth $67 million.\nThe A's are slated to enter their second season since departing Oakland as part of a multi-city relocation route. They spent last year and will spend the next few years in Sacramento until a ballpark is constructed in Las Vegas.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The second matchup of the NBA Christmas schedule is one that is growing increasingly familiar for fans. The San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder played perhaps the game of the year in the NBA Cup semifinals. They played again on Tuesday, just two days before Christmas. The Spurs won both games, handing the Thunder (26-4) half of their losses to this point in the season. Now they'll square off for the third time this month on Christmas itself.Somehow, I doubt any fans are complaining. The Thunder and Spurs represent what most expect to be the defining rivalry of this era of NBA history. Oklahoma City already has a championship to its name along with one of the deepest rosters in NBA history. Victor Wembanyama represents arguably the greatest threat to their impending dynasty in the NBA as an impossibly skilled giant with a seeming distaste for Thunder big man Chet Holmgren.So how are we gearing up for Thunder-Spurs Round 3? With best bets, of course. Below is our pick against the spread plus a prop bet headed into what might be the day's marquee game.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpurs at Thunder: Where to watchTime: 2:30 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Paycom Center -- Oklahoma CityTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Thunder -9.5, O/U: 235.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Spurs at Thunder: Odds, prediction, best bets\nLook, we're basing this off of vibes. Oklahoma City's first loss to San Antonio was a close, marquee game. Their second turned into a blowout in the fourth quarter. For the first time in the Thunder's young run, people are starting to wonder if a team has their number. Wembanyama's disdain for Holmgren should only intensify Oklahoma City's resolve. Expect the Thunder to come out motivated on Christmas, and as big as this line looks, remember, the Thunder have played 14 games in Oklahoma City this season and haven't lost one of them. In fact, they only have one single-digit home victory, which came on Oct. 28 against the Kings. The Thunder blow everyone out in their building. This should be no exception. The Pick: Thunder -9.5\nWe're sticking with the motivational theme for our prop pick. Chet Holmgren scored only seven points in Tuesday's loss to the Spurs, but it's worth noting that he scored 17 in the NBA Cup loss and had reached this over in seven of the nine previous games that he played. He's gonna go at Wembanyama on Christmas in an effort to prove that there is in fact a rivalry between the two of them. The Pick: Holmgren Over 15.5 Points\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Nuggets sit third in the Western Conference at 21-8, but their depth will be put to the test once again after seeing starting forward Cam Johnson suffer a knee injury. Johnson sustained a bone bruise in his right knee in a loss to the Mavs on Tuesday and while an MRI revealed no structural damage, he will be re-evaluated in 4-6 weeks with the injury, the team announced on Thursday. Johnson is averaging 11.7 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game on 46.1/42.9/81.0 shooting splits in 28 starts this season. With Johnson out, the Nuggets are now down three starters. Aaron Gordon remains sidelined with a hamstring strain and Christian Braun is still a week away from his re-evaluation after spraining his ankle earlier this season. Despite the absences of Gordon and Braun, the Nuggets have managed to stay near the top of the Western Conference thanks to the sensational play of Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray, as well as getting strong contributions from their bench after bolstering their depth this offseason. With Johnson out, that depth will be put under even greater stress, as will Jokić and Murray to continue producing the majority of Denver's offensive production.\nWithout Johnson, the Nuggets will have to ask more of their wing rotation and lose some more size and versatility at the forward spot. Johnson has played more power forward than small forward this season due to Gordon's extended absence, and the likes of Peyton Watson and Spencer Jones may see more time at the four -- with Zeke Nnaji and Hunter Tyson also options there from deeper down the bench. Everything in Denver starts with their two stars, and as long as Murray and Jokić are healthy, the offense will operate at an elite level. However, their defense was already on shaky ground without Braun and Gordon and losing Johnson will make them even weaker on that end of the floor. Braun and Gordon are both nearing their timetables for re-evaluation, but will still need time to ramp up to game shape once eventually cleared. \nIn the meantime, the Nuggets will look to hold on to strong position in the hotly contested Western Conference playoff race. They're only 1.5 games up on the Lakers and Timberwolves and three games ahead of the Rockets in sixth. They'll face that Minnesota team in the nightcap of the Christmas slate in their first game without Johnson before a lengthy East coast road trip that starts in Orlando and goes to Miami, Toronto, Cleveland, Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Boston. \n            ",

That may not be the case this year as the Sabres work their way onto the nice list with a seven-game winning streak.Earlier this season, I buried the Sabres in these very power rankings, and I underestimated how long the Eastern Conference standings would be a compressed mess. The difference between last place and second place is a mere 10 points.That has opened the door for any team lucky enough to get hot at the right time, and the Sabres have seized upon that opening with a nice run just in time for Christmas. Buffalo is now just three points out of a playoff spot with a game in hand, and it feels like belief is starting to build.Over this stretch, Alex Lyon has stepped up as the No. 1 option in net with 3.94 goals saved above average, and Tage Thompson has tallied four goals and four assists. Rasmus Dahlin has also caught fire from the blue line with two goals and six assists while playing lights out defense.\nIn a wide open Eastern Conference, why can't the Sabres get hot and end their 14-season playoff drought? That's what fans are asking themselves as they get a little hope in their stockings this Christmas.With that in mind, here are the updated NHL Power Rankings with one Christmas wish for each team.\nAll expected goals and goals saved above average data courtesy of Natural Stat Trick.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                9\n            \n                Sabres\n            \n                7\n            \n                Maple Leafs\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Avalanche\n                                \n                            Power play prowess | The only thing this Avalanche team doesn't do well is score on the power play, which boggles the mind.

One of those favorites, the New York Knicks, has more than lived up to the billing. They won the NBA Cup earlier this month and are hovering around a 60-win pace under new head coach Mike Brown. The other, the Cleveland Cavaliers, have struggled quite a bit more. After losing just 18 games all season a year ago, the Cavaliers are in danger of reaching that total in January this season. With Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen underwhelming and nobody's shots falling, Cleveland's contender status is in serious doubt. The Cavs enter Christmas with a 17-14 record and in seventh place in the East.How could they get their season back on track? A marquee win over the Knicks would be a good start. So to prepare for the Christmas action, below are our best bets for Knicks-Cavs, both against the spread and through props.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCavaliers at Knicks: Where to watchTime: 12 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Madison Square Garden -- New YorkTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Knicks -6.5, O/U: 239.5 (via DraftKings) Cavaliers at Knicks odds, prediction, best bet\nHas Cleveland really righted the ship, or the Cavaliers just making their shots? They've won their last two games, but allowed 250 points in the process. Those wins came because they took 93 3-pointers and made 44 of them. Now, Cleveland lived off of its shooting a season ago, but there are still major problems here. Darius Garland is starting to right the ship, but with Evan Mobley dealing with a calf strain, it'd be hard to pick against a Knicks team that's rolling at home in a marquee game even with some injuries of their own. Jalen Brunson sat on Tuesday for load-management purposes, so he should be good to go in this one. The Pick: Knicks -6\nMitchell Robinson averaged just under 10 rebounds per game when the Knicks played the Cavaliers in the 2023 playoffs. He's faced them three times since then in the regular season and pulled in 30 total rebounds. He just has a way of bullying Jarrett Allen, who was so shaken after that playoff series that he admitted \"the lights were brighter than expected.\" So I'm not overthinking this one. Expect Robinson to own the glass. The Pick: Robinson Over 7.5 Rebounds\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        It's that time of year, when Santa Claus makes dreams come true for kids across the world. What if he came to college basketball bearing gifts? What would he bring?The wish list is long for players, coaches, teams and leagues around the sport. With nonconference play wrapping up for most programs, needs are more obvious now than they were before the season. If expectations are going to be met or surpassed, a visit from college basketball's Santa Claus would be ideal for almost everyone. While no such gift-bearing phenomenon exists, we are getting in the holiday spirt for this week's Dribble Handoff. These are the gifts we would give if we could play the role of college basketball's Santa Claus.For St. John's: A point guard Unless things dramatically turn around and culminate with a deep run through the bracket of the 2026 NCAA Tournament, this season at St. John's will forever be remembered as the one that started with Rick Pitino calling Ian Jackson the Red Storm's \"next great point\" but quickly turned into something that had the Hall of Fame coach lamenting the idea that nobody on his roster qualifies as a true high-major point guard.\nIt's not ideal!Can St. John's still be good without a legitimate high-major lead-guard? Sure, I guess. The Red Storm are still 20th at BartTorvik.com and KenPom.com -- and 26th in the Top 25 And 1. They're not bad. They're just not ... great. And unfortunately for anybody who might've had them No. 1 in the preseason, it appears likely that they'll always fall something short of great because of some combination of recruiting failures and miscalculations that have left one of the sport's most talented rosters with a gaping hole. -- Gary ParrishFor Mick Cronin: Cozy clothes, sleeping pills and an airplane pillowMy colleagues are trying to gift out individual things to teams increase their chances of winning over the next three months. But I am looking at the calendar and trying to be more practical. There's an urgent matter just over the horizon that needs immediate attention.A year ago, UCLA coach Mick Cronin was furious at the sight of the Statue of Liberty and the state of the Bruins' travel schedule. He was so miffed by the team's travel arrangements, he made sure of two things last offseason: he would quietly sign a big new contract, and he his team did not leave the state of California for any of its nonconference games this November and December. But Big Ten play starts in earnest the next in less than two weeks, and I have some tough news for Cronin — It's time to hit the road\nJan. 3: @ IowaJan. 6: @ WisconsinJan. 10: vs. MarylandJan. 14: @ Penn StateJan. 17: @ Ohio StateThe 10-3 Bruins have four of their first five games of 2026 not only on the road, but two or three time zones away. The brunt of UCLA's Big Ten travel is early, which is probably preferred, but Cronin's capacity to go viral with a postgame rant is all the more probable thanks to this unforgiving start to January. The team may well lose three of its first five games after the New Year. That in mind, Cronin needs some Lululemon, travel slippers, sleeping medication for the long flights, a high-end pillow to help catch some Zs and a few podcasts to pass the time/reduce his anxiety. Obviously, Eye on College Basketball should be the go-to, but if he's looking for something outside of sports, SmartLess and Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend are as enjoyable as non-sports pods get. -- Matt NorlanderFor Illinois: A playmaking defender Illinois is scoring 127.5 points per 100 possessions, per KenPom data. That's a mark ranked second nationally in adjusted efficiency margin per the website. That's elite. They are picking teams apart by taking care of the ball, shooting it efficiently and smashing teams on the offensive glass. What's not elite for the Illini, and largely why there are 9-3 instead of 12-0: their defense.\nThey are surrendering 98.1 points per 100 possessions -- a number ranked 27th nationally in adjusted efficiency. That's perfectly fine and could get Illinois to 25 wins with ease. But it is nowhere close to elite. (Michigan, for comparison, is first, surrendering just 88.2 points per 100 possessions.)They are dead last among major conference teams in steal rate defensively and in turnover rate forced. (And, for what it's worth, this is a theme under Brad Underwood going back several years.) They don't generate enough chaos to create transition opportunities -- an area that, per Synergy data, Illinois rates in the 92nd percentile in nationally. Let's give the Illini a defensive playmaker or two and just see what happens. If this team was even at the Div. I average in steal rate or turnover rate defensively they could level up to a juggernaut potentially with the way their offense is humming. That's not the case. And it may be the one area I would pinpoint that ultimately keeps this team as a No. 3 or 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament as opposed to a No. 1 or 2 seed. It's areas on the margin holding Illinois back that separates Illinois from just a good defense to a truly great one. -- Kyle Boone\nFor Kentucky: Magic shoulder creamIf Kentucky could just have a healthy and available Lowe, it would alleviate many of its problems. With frontcourt players Mo Dioubate and Jayden Quaintance back in the rotation after working back from injuries of their own, a clean bill of health for Lowe is the final missing piece. That's why I'm getting the Wildcats some magic shoulder cream that fixes all shoulder issues for point guards. It's the second year in a row UK is grappling with this problem. Last year, it was Lamont Butler, who soldiered through shoulder issues that required him to wear a bulky brace. This year, Lowe has played in just six of UK's 13 games while navigating a problematic shoulder situation of his own.Lowe is the Wildcats' most impactful offensive player, according to EvanMiya.com's BPR metric, because he's the straw that stirs the drink. He's this roster's one true point guard, and life without him makes for some ugly offense. --David Cobb\nFor Vermont and Mercyhurst: A jump-ball victoryAccording to KenPom's glorious database, there are only two teams that have not won the opening tip against a fellow Division I club. Vermont and Mercyhurst. The basketball gods have to rectify this. Vermont is particularly confusing. John Becker has trotted out three different players to try and win the jump to no avail. Gus Yalden (0-1), Ben Michaels (0-2) and Noah Barnett (0-10) have all whiffed.Oh, and the jump ball isn't nothing. Models predict that winning the jump ball increases your chance of winning the game by 3%. Even with the opening-tip follies, Vermont is still projected to be the kings of the America East. Mercyhurst very likely won't win the NEC, but it will have that early-November victory over Loyola-Chicago on the ledger forever. -- Isaac TrotterFor Kansas: A healthy Darryn PetersonThere were not many players in college basketball (in recent memory) who arrived with more hype entering the season than Peterson. The projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is one of the best guard prospects of this generation and is an elite scorer. Simply put, it's been a shame Peterson hasn't been able to play more because I think people are forgetting how good he is. Peterson has only appeared in four games this season. For Kansas to be the best version of itself down the stretch, it's going to need him to be healthy.\nThat's why, for Christmas, I'm giving Peterson a fresh bill of health. College basketball fans deserve to watch one of the best players in the sport play more. Kansas coach Bill Self already said this week that it's a mutual agreement between Kansas and the Peterson family to hold him out until he's at full strength. -- Cameron Salerno\n            ",

The Pistons had little trouble in their 126-111 road win over the Knicks, who are one of Detroit's top competitors to win the Eastern Conference. The Pistons have surged past the Thunder for the best record in the NBA at 42-13, including 21-6 at home. Cade Cunningham had 42 points against the Knicks, and he's averaging 25.5 points per game this season as a bona fide superstar. The Spurs are also 8-1 over their last nine games, but six of those nine games were at home, and only one of three road wins came against a team in the top six of their conference. The model projects the Pistons to win in 72% of simulations, showcasing strong value for Monday NBA bets. Back the Pistons at DraftKings here:North Carolina (+124) to defeat LouisvilleThe Tar Heels are a rare home underdog on Monday, and the model is jumping on that opportunity. North Carolina is 15-0 at Chapel Hill this season, including a 71-68 win on Feb. 7 against Duke, which just defeated No. 1 Michigan on Saturday. The Tar Heels are coming off a 77-64 win over Syracuse on Saturday, improving to 21-6 overall and 9-5 in the ACC. Louisville (20-7, 9-5) is having a strong season as well, but the Cardinals dropped their last road game to unranked SMU, 85-75. Louisville has lost four straight against ranked teams and hasn't defeated a ranked team since No. 22 Indiana on Dec. 6. North Carolina has won its last three head-to-head in Chapel Hill, and the model projects that to continue on Monday. The Tar Heels win in 46% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 44.6%. Back North Carolina at DraftKings here:Walter Clayton Jr., Grizzlies, Over 7.5 total rebounds + assists (-127)\"After missing three games with a calf contusion, Walter Clayton Jr. returned to play 25 minutes against the Heat on Saturday. He started, posting four rebounds and six assists,\" SportsLine expert Mike Barner said. \"Over three games with the Grizzlies, he has averaged 3.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists. Cedric Coward (knee) is out, which should put Clayton in line to play around 25 minutes again. Considering that the Kings rank 19th in rebounds allowed per game and 26th in assists allowed per game, that's enough playing time for Clayton to make this over appealing.\" Back Clayton at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather are set to run back one of the biggest fights in boxing history. Mayweather and Pacquiao will rematch in a Sept. 19 clash from The Sphere in Las Vegas, as announced by Netflix, with the streaming service set to air the event.The first meeting between Pacquiao and Mayweather took years of negotiation to come together, as both fighters were on top of the boxing world. The fight eventually happened in May 2015. Mayweather won the fight by clear unanimous decision, with the fight reportedly drawing more than 4.5 million pay-per-view buys, making it a massive success, though the fight itself disappointed many due to a general lack of action.\nNegotiations for the first meeting began in early 2010, though those plans fell apart when the two sides could not come to an agreement on drug testing for the fight.Drug testing would continue to be a sticking point as negotiations would continue as time passed. Between the type of drug testing, with Mayweather wanting \"Olympic-style\" testing, or timing, with Pacquiao refusing testing that went beyond 14 days prior to the bout, testing remained an ongoing sticking point as the negotiations dragged on for years.\nOver the past few years, the idea of a rematch has popped up repeatedly, though it never seemed to gain much momentum until recent months, when interest was ignited once again.After a controversial semifinal loss in the 1996 Olympics that ultimately led to winning a bronze medal, Mayweather turned professional, going on to hold world championships across five weight classes. Mayweather's championship accomplishments are slightly eclipsed by Pacquiao, who remains the only boxer to have won world championships in eight different divisions.Pacquiao, 47, ended his retirement in July 2025, facing Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight title. That fight, Pacquiao's first professional bout since a WBA welterweight title loss to Yordenis Ugas in August 2021, ended in a majority draw but showed Pacquiao to still have some of his signature speed and power.\nMayweather, 48, has not fought professionally since a TKO win over UFC superstar Conor McGregor in August 2017. The win over McGregor allowed Mayweather to enter retirement with a sparkling 50-0 record.Both Mayweather and Pacquiao have participated in various exhibition bouts in the years since entering retirement. Mayweather is currently planning another exhibition, this time against Mike Tyson, in an event that was recently announced as a final tune-up before returning to the professional ranks.Likewise, Pacquiao recently announced an April exhibition against Ruslan Provodnikov in what will be his own tune-up ahead of the clash with his former rival.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dynasty ranking changes from January to February are generally pretty minimal. They are mostly influenced by the smattering of news we get and my first run at 2026 Fantasy Football projections. This year, at quarterback, the changes in the rankings are almost completely nonexistent. Just don't get used to this static situation because before I release my March rankings, there are at least eight quarterbacks who could change uniforms and their Dynasty outlook radically altered.My way-too-early 2026 quarterback projections are here.The first two obvious names are Kyler Murray and Tua Tagovailoa. Both of their respective teams have new coaches and have expressed at least some interest in moving on from their very expensive quarterbacks. The risk of them not finding starting jobs has already been factored in to some degree, but it could be worse. For either of these quarterbacks, if their situations are unresolved a month from now, I will be more nervous. At the same time, if they find a new home as a starter in March, they could be risers. I am more optimistic both about Murray's chances of finding a starting job and his Fantasy upside if he does, which is why he is ranked considerably higher than Tagovailoa.Earlier in February, I had Jay Felicio from QB List on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty to discuss the state of the quarterback position. Check it out:\nThe free agent I am most interested in monitoring in the next month is Malik Willis. From my view, those two teams we just talked about, the Dolphins and the Cardinals, are the two most likely to give Willis a starter's contract in 2026. The path to him being a riser in the next month is if Willis receives a contract that offers him more long-term security than what Justin Fields received last year. These two coaching staffs have close connections to the Packers, so if anyone is willing to take that risk, it should be them. Over the past two seasons, Willis has thrown 89 passes and averaged 10.9 yards per attempt with six touchdowns and zero interceptions. Combine that with his rushing upside, and if Willis gets a three-year deal, he could vault into the top 20 in the rankings below.Other quarterbacks who could see the biggest gains or losses in the next month are Jacoby Brissett, Aaron Rodgers, Daniel Jones, and Geno Smith. Of course, we have no reason to expect Rodgers to make a decision that fast, and we'll have to wait until August at least to see how Jones' rehab is coming. One thing is for sure: We should expect far more changes in the Dynasty QB rankings next month than we got this month. We may even get to add Derek Carr back in if he decides to return to the NFL.I don't rank rookies until they are drafted, but I have already started to think about where I will put them. Assuming Fernando Mendoza is taken first overall by the Raiders, I anticipate he will rank somewhere between QB15 and QB18 in the rankings below. I would be surprised if any other rookie cracks the top 25.\nHere are my updated Dynasty QB rankings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Team USA's World Baseball Classic roster looks like the best they've ever put together, but it just took a hit.Two-time AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal will pitch just once for USA and it'll happen in pool play (March 7 vs. Great Britain). If the USA advances to the championship round, as expected, Skubal won't pitch.\"If they go to the finals, I think I'm going to try and lobby to just go watch and be with the guys,\" he told reporters, including The Athletic, Monday.That's too bad. Those of us who had already started looking ahead figured Skubal could be the USA starter in either the semifinals or finals, giving a nice edge to the squad. After all, he's won two straight Cy Young awards, two straight AL ERA titles and has a 2.04 ERA in six career playoff starts. Instead, if the USA advances, it'll be without Skubal. \nThat gives the mantle of ace to Paul Skenes alone, instead of Skenes just being a \"co-ace.\" The USA isn't hurting for starters after Skubal or Skenes, either, as All-Stars Logan Webb and Matthew Boyd are also on the team. Fellow All-Star Joe Ryan is on the roster, though he's currently dealing with a back injury, as is youngster Nolan McLean and his veteran Mets teammate Clay Holmes. The offense is headed up by Aaron Judge, Cal Raleigh, Bobby Witt Jr., Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber. This is to say that, yes, the USA is still plenty talented and could well win the finals. Not having Skubal for the championship round is still a bit of a bummer.\nPool play kicks off next week in Tokyo, San Juan, Houston, and Miami, and the tournament will conclude with the championship game at Miami's LoanDepot Park on March 17. Team USA won the 2017 WBC, but fell to Japan in the finals in 2023. The Americans are the favorite to win this year (-115, per Caesars), ahead of Japan (+350) and the Dominican Republic (+425).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Army-Navy Game, which has been held on the second Saturday of December since 2009, has been at the center of recent discussions with regard to College Football Playoff expansion and scheduling due to its unique placement on the regular-season schedule. In a departure from recent tradition, Army coach Jeff Monken said he would like to see the historic rivalry game move up a week to pave the way for the CFP to start earlier.The rivalry series, dubbed \"America's Game,\" holds its contests the week after conference championship games to retain its own timeslot. The pageantry and tradition involved with one of college football's most storied rivalries has long justified the separate window. But amid calls for the season to wrap up earlier than late-January, Monken said moving the Army-Navy Game back to Thanksgiving weekend is necessary.\"There's not an appetite for the college football season to go all the way to the end of January,\" Monken said to The Athletic. \"There's a real hope that we can get this thing into one semester, and have the championship game around Jan. 1, which I think would be awesome.\"Because the CFP avoids broadcast competition with the NFL and prioritizes giving teams a full week between games, the playoff schedule for the next two years comes with lengthy layoffs (nearly two weeks between rounds) and national championship games scheduled for Jan. 25 and Jan. 24. Playoff expansion from four teams to 12 only led to the season extending deeper into the winter.If the Army-Navy Game were to move back to Thanksgiving weekend, or even to conference championship week, the CFP could begin a week earlier and thus prevent such late winter championship games.\nAny proposal to move the annual contest from its protected window would likely receive pushback. President Donald Trump last month said that he plans to sign an executive order which would prevent any football games from going head-to-head with the Army-Navy Game. That came after the now-defunct LA Bowl kicked off a half hour after the start of the 2025 installment.\"I think Army-Navy is a huge part of the history of college football, and what it is today, even,\" Monken said. \"Give us a four-hour block on Thanksgiving, or on Friday of Thanksgiving, or on Saturday of Thanksgiving, and give us a four-hour block, and just say nobody else plays during this four-hour block. That's still protecting the game.\"The Army-Navy series began in 1890, and the football game has been contested every year since 1930. Navy holds a 64-55-7 all-time advantage and won the last two meetings, including a 17-16 thriller last season.\nCBS Sports has held the broadcast rights for the Army-Navy Game since 1996 and will continue to air the game on its networks through 2038. The 2026 meeting will take place on Dec. 12 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as part of commemorating the 25th anniversary of 9/11. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Slow starts have hindered Scottie Scheffler early in the 2026 PGA Tour season. You know it. He knows it. The whole golf world knows it. Of course, \"slow\" and \"hindered\" are relative when it comes to what the world No. 1 is capable of accomplishing. Scheffler looked like a mid-handicapper for 50% of the Genesis Invitational yet still finished T12 alongside Jordan Spieth, a player who completed his best tournament finish since June 2025. This is not a drive-by on Spieth; it is an illustration that Scheffler's performances are all about perspective.Scheffler went to bed Thursday evening without another name below his on the leaderboard. He played his first 10 holes of the tournament in 5 over and was forced to make an 8-foot par putt on his 36th hole just to see hole No. 37 in a tournament where no one misses the cut. And still, he somehow threatened to extend his top 10 streak to 19 in a row ... though he did ultimately fall short, ending the longest run on the PGA Tour.Perspective!Scheffler won in his season debut at the American Express, becoming the third player under the age of 30 to notch 20 PGA Tour victories and four major championships. The other two? Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. Scheffler finished one stroke outside of a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open after opening with a 73 that put him 10 strokes behind his playing partner and eventual winner, Chris Gotterup.\nA win would have been Scheffler's third at that tournament -- a mark that would have pulled him alongside none other than Arnold Palmer for most in the event's history.After opening with a 72 in benign conditions at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Scheffler closed with a 63 thanks to three final-round eagles, falling two strokes short of eventual champion Collin Morikawa. A win at Pebble Beach means something a little more. You look at the names. You look at that venue. You read through the history.The same holds at Riviera Country Club, host of the Genesis Invitational, especially as it represents one of the three biggest non-major tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule. The signature events reign these days, but there are three tournaments with lasting power, no matter how the PGA Tour calendar might change.\nTiger's tournament.Arnie's tournament.Jack's tournament.Combined, they make up the PGA Tour's big three player-hosted invitationals that, despite being labeled signature events, still have cuts at the 36-hole mark. Should they chop off more than those who finish outside the top 50 and more than 10 strokes behind the leader, especially when a field is only 72 players? Yes, but that is a conversation for a different day.Winning one is amazing. Just ask last week's champion, Jacob Bridgeman. Winning two, now that is something really special. Many of the all-time greats have done just that. But winning all three on those golf courses? That is as rare as it gets when it comes to PGA Tour accolades, as only Fred Couples and Ernie Els have conquered the triumvirate (Hale Irwin won the 1976 Citrus Open at Rio Pinar Country Club, later called the Arnold Palmer Invitational).Players to win at least two of the big threePlayerTotal winsGenesis InvitationalArnold Palmer InvitationalMemorial TournamentTiger Woods13🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆Fred Couples4🏆🏆🏆🏆Ernie Els4🏆🏆🏆🏆Kenny Perry4🏆🏆🏆🏆Scottie Scheffler4🏆🏆🏆🏆Tom Watson4🏆🏆🏆🏆Hale Irwin3🏆🏆🏆Phil Mickelson3🏆🏆🏆Bryson DeChambeau2🏆🏆Hideki Matsuyama2🏆🏆Jon Rahm2🏆🏆Vijay Singh2🏆🏆There are stipulations to all of the names listed above -- blame the PGA Tour's record keeping -- as Els, of course, did not receive a trophy from Woods. In fact, he was making sure he was not winning one as the Big Easy's title came at the expense of Woods, who finished two strokes behind the South African -- the closest he ever came to winning at Riviera. Irwin's win at the Citrus Open came before Palmer began hosting the event at Bay Hill.\"Here and Memorial -- I think the player-hosted invitationals are becoming increasingly important in the PGA Tour schedule,\" Rory McIlroy said last week. \"I have been lucky enough to win at Bay Hill, but Arnold wasn't around when I did it. It would be really cool to get a trophy from Tiger and get a trophy from Jack at some point. [Riviera] and Muirfield are two ones that I would love to check off.\"Scheffler has already won twice at Arnie's and Jack's tournaments, but Tiger's continues to elude him. It is not unfair to suggest this year might have been it had he not started so poorly. Scheffler played his final 62 holes in 16 under, while Bridgeman won the tournament at 18 under. Over the last three rounds, Scheffler clipped the winner by a shot.While these rough starts have put Scheffler in holes, they have allowed us to see his true competitive grit. That no-quit attitude is reminiscent of a boxer who has taken punch after punch to the point that he can't see out of one eye, but he still manages to stay on his feet and go another round.Scheffler remains the favorite at all four major championships: 3-1 at the Masters, 19/5 at the PGA Championship, 16/5 at the U.S. Open and 5-1 at The Open, per FanDuel.The comebacks have been impressive and fun to watch. They have shown us what Scheffler is capable of achieving, even when he's stuck deep in the chasing pack. In another sense, they have shown us what else he can do, as we already knew the Texan can win when he's well out in front.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2028 Summer Olympics are still two years away, but athletes are already confirming that they intend to compete when Los Angeles serves as host. Four-time Olympic gold medalist Kevin Durant is one of those athletes, as he told ESPN that he has every intention to compete at the 2028 Games.\"Hell yeah, I want to play,\" Durant said. \"I would love to, but I've got to stay on top of my game. I'm not expecting, I want to produce on the floor and make Grant [Hill] and whoever is making the decisions, want to put me on the team. I don't want -- not just for seniority. I want to still prove I can help the team win.\"Durant will be just two months shy of turning 40 when the 2028 Summer Olympics happen, but if he maintains the level of play that we've seen this season over the next two years, there would be no reason to not include him on the Olympic roster.Health will certainly be a major factor in the matter, but Durant's been durable in each of the last three seasons including the current one, and if that trend keeps, he should be a no-brainer to make the roster. The way Durant plays lends itself to aging well in the NBA, and we've seen that in the years since he tore his Achilles in 2019. He's been an All-Star in six of the seven years since that injury cost him a full season in the NBA, and the outlier year was because he was limited to 39 games due to injury.\nDurant earning a roster spot on Team USA isn't the surprising part, it's that he still wants to compete in the Olympics. There was an assumption that the 2024 Paris Games would be the final year he, LeBron James and Stephen Curry would all compete with Team USA. James has already said publicly that he doesn't plan on suiting up for the 2028 Games. Curry hasn't said if he'll play, but he'll also be 40 by then.But Durant is letting us know that we were all wrong with that line of thinking.\"You guys, the media, have projected that,\" Durant said. \"That narrative, where did the last dance thing come from? I didn't say I wasn't playing. LeBron said he wasn't. You didn't hear that from me or Steph.\"For now we can pencil Durant's name in for the 2028 Olympic roster, which will certainly see some turnover with all the aging stars likely not participating. Cade Cunningham stated his desire to play in the 2028 Olympics in a recent GQ profile, while making the bold statement that he thinks he's the best American player. And will get some holdovers like Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton, as well as several of the younger players who are just starting out like Rookie of the Year frontrunners Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel.\nTeam USA certainly won't be short on talent to pick from, but there's already this narrative that other countries are starting to catch up with them. The men's basketball team has won a gold medal in each of the last five Olympic Games, as they've been the far superior team in most cases in Olympic history. There's only been three times the U.S. men's basketball team hasn't won gold since 1936, so it's been an incredibly dominant run for them in the sport for a very long time.However, at the 2024 Games, teams like Serbia and France did put up a good fight against Team USA, and Canada's talent pool just continues to deepen with each passing year. The talent gap isn't as wide as it once was, but Durant thinks it's being overblown.\"I just don't like the talk around the USA versus European style of how you approach the game,\" Durant said. \"All I hear is, 'AAU is destroying the game; the Euros do it right while the Americans do it wrong.'\" \nDurant went on to talk about how he feels the conversation feels a bit racially charged in the way its discussed.\"It's a lot of bullshit with that,\" Durant said. \"I can read between the lines on that. It's a shot at Black Americans. We're controlling the sport. They're tired of us controlling the sport. 'France is coming for you.' Really? We smacked them boys.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jaxon Smith-Njigba picked the perfect time to have the best season of his career. The NFL's reigning Offensive Player of the Year led the league in receiving yards in 2025 during a career season that saw him go off for 1,793 yards and 10 touchdown catches. The timing couldn't have been better for the Seahawks star, who just finished his third NFL season, which means he's now eligible to get a contract extension for the first time. Smith-Njigba, who was selected with the 23rd overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has developed into one of the top receivers in the NFL and he definitely wants to be paid like one of the top receivers. During a recent interview with Jonah Javad of WFAA, the 24-year-old was asked if wants to be the highest paid receiver in the NFL and he didn't hesitate with his answer. \"I think, I believe I deserve to be the highest paid in my position, just what I give to the game and the community, I give it my all,\" JSN said. \"I think that's worth a lot.\"\nSmith-Njigba made just $1.55 million in base salary last season during the third year of his rookie deal and he's only scheduled to make $2.72 million in 2026 (He signed a four-year, $14.42 million rookie deal that included a $7.49 million signing bonus), so he's certainly underpaid. After his huge 2025 season, he's clearly looking for a raise. So what does that mean for the Seahawks? Glad you asked. Let's check out the receiver market. Highest-paid receivers in the NFLThe NFL's highest-paid receiver right now is Ja'Marr Chase, who signed a four-year, $161 million contract extension back in March. Chase's deal pays him an average of $40.25 million per year, so if Smith-Njigba is looking to top that number, that means he's aiming to get $40.3 million per year at the minimum.\nThe second-highest paid receiver in the NFL is Minnesota's Justin Jefferson, who's pulling in an average of $35 million per year. There's a huge gap between Chase and Jefferson and it's possible the Seahawks could try to fit Smith-Njigba's new contract number somewhere in there, but with JSN saying \"I deserve to be the highest paid,\" there may not be a lot of wiggle room. This could be a situation where the Seahawks either agree to pay him what he's asking for or things could get contentious. The Seahawks will also likely need to include more than $110 million in guaranteed money to top both Chase and Jefferson in that department. The Seahawks do have Smith-Njigba under contract for one more year (2026), plus a potential fifth-year option in 2027 on top of that, so they could conceivably kick the can until next offseason. Yes, JSN wants to get paid, but he doesn't seem to be in a hurry. \"I'm really not too pressed right now to get it done,\" Smith-Njigba said. \"I know my time is coming and when we get it done it's gonna be a great deal. And, you know, God's timing is perfect timing. So, whenever that may come, we'll be ready for it.\"\nBasically, a deal could certainly get done this season, but there's also a chance that it would take until next offseason. One big reason why Smith-Njigba might be willing to wait is because the receiver market could be going up in the next few months, which takes us to our next topic. Why the Rams should be paying close attentionAs things currently stand, there are only really two players who have any shot of resetting the receiving market over the next 12 months. One of them is Smith-Njigba and the other one is Puka Nacua. The Rams receiver has been one of the biggest bargains in NFL history over the past three years. During the 2025 season, he made just $1.03 million in base salary under the terms of his rookie contract and that will go up to just $5.66 million in 2026. Although JSN's rookie contract could technically keep him tied to Seattle until 2027, the Rams are in a more pressing situation with Nacua. Since he was taken in the fifth-round, there's no fifth-year option with his contract. His deal expires after the 2026 season, so the Rams need to get something done now (or they could face a situation where they're forced to hit him with the franchise tag next year). \nNacua led the NFL in yards per game (107.2) and receptions in 2025 (129). He's also averaged 104.3 catches per year during his three NFL seasons. Rams general manager Les Snead is well aware that his team is going to have to pay Nacua a boatload of money in the very near future.  \"If you're one of the best at what you do and obviously he's evolved into one of the best things, that's a pretty simple contract because it's pretty self-explanatory where you fall in the ecosystem and the hierarchy,\" Snead said in early February. The Rams general manager also added that he's hoping to negotiate a win-win contract with Nacua so that the Rams have some money left over to pay other guys. \n\"There are also so many variables,\" Snead said of negotiating this type of contract. \"There are other players whose contracts are up. Maybe there are so many variables that go into to that make it more complex than it would seem on the surface level. Similar to a few players we've had in the past that have been at that level in the ecosystem, you have to begin communication and begin working through it to come up with win-win solution.\"The Nacua negotiation and the Smith-Njigba negotiation are almost certainly going to have an impact on each other, which is why the Rams will be paying close attention to the Seahawks and the Seahawks will be paying close attention to the Rams. If Nacua gets a deal first that makes him the highest-paid receiver in the NFL, then Smith-Njigba will likely turn around and look to top that number. If JSN gets his deal first, then Nacua may look to top that number, and due to that dynamic, that would explain why Smith-Njigba isn't in any rush to get his deal done. If Nacua gets his new contrac first, that will likely mean even more money for JSN. In this case, being patient could pay off big for Smith-Njigba. \nOf course, the Seahawks could always try and talk JSN into playing for nothing, which he almost seems open to. Almost. \"I would play this game for free,\" Smith-Njigba said on WFAA. \"I love this game so much, but you don't have to [play for free]. I'm learning to be a good businessman and we need that check at the end of the day.\"If Smith-Njigba gets an extension done this offseason, his next check could end up being worth more than his entire rookie contract. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Winter Olympics concluded on Sunday, and the NBA is already looking ahead to the 2028 games. Recently, four-time Olympian Kevin Durant said that he wants to play for a historic fifth gold medal in Los Angeles. \"Hell yeah, I want to play,\" Durant said. \"I would love to, but I've got to stay on top of my game. I'm not expecting, I want to produce on the floor and make Grant (Hill) and whoever is making the decisions, want to put me on the team. I don't want -- not just for seniority. I want to still prove I can help the team win.\"Durant may ultimately deserve a spot on merit -- 2028 is still a ways away for a 37-year-old, but he is still an All-Star-caliber NBA player -- but if he wants a spot, it's his on seniority. He is the greatest Olympic basketball player of all time, and his skillset should age well enough and fits so smoothly next to other elite players that, short of significant injury- or age-related decline, it's hard to envision a scenario in which he wouldn't be able to help Team USA.But that exacerbates a first-world problem for Team USA: after years of fear about the American developmental pipeline, we're in the middle of a talent boom. The last handful of drafts have been very kind to American prospects, and when you consider all of the great existing American players who have already worn the red, white and blue, it suddenly gets very difficult to trim the roster down to 12 players. With Durant in place, there are really only 11 spots.So... who do we think is filling those other slots? We're going to take a shot at filling in the rest of the team. Keep in mind that we're still more than two years away here, so aging will be a factor. So will the stylistic differences between the NBA and FIBA game. Remember, FIBA has no defensive three-second rule, no goaltending and a shorter 3-point line, so shooting is at an absolute premium. Officials tend to call fewer fouls as well, allowing for more physicality defensively. We still have a ways to go before 2028, but for now, these are the players who make the most sense four Team USA's next Olympic roster.\nThe starsYes, yes, I know, almost everyone who plays for Team USA is going to qualify as a \"star.\" But every Olympic cycle reminds us this process is a bit more complex than slapping the 12 biggest names together. We just watched Jayson Tatum ride the bench in the 2024 run to gold while his less-accomplished NBA teammate, Derrick White, played a vital rotation role. The idea here is to grab a handful of the best players in the NBA and then use the rest of the roster to round out the team with specialists.Now, Durant will be on the team, but he will be 39 when the Olympics arrive. He's probably coming off of the bench. We'll address the bigs separately. Fortunately, the four other starters appear to be relatively straightforward at this point.Cade Cunningham is, at worst, the fourth-best point guard in the NBA. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is Canadian, Luka Dončić is Slovenian and Stephen Curry likely won't be back as a 40-year-old in 2028. That leaves Cunningham as the obvious choice as our starting point guard. His playmaking should fit in quite well on an Olympic roster with far more offensive firepower than his Pistons, and his size and defensive versatility ensure he won't get picked on. This one's a no-brainer.Anthony Edwards won gold in 2024, has improved markedly as a shooter and post player since then and will turn 27 soon after the 2028 Olympics. He should be at the peak of his powers at this point and could easily be the best American player in the NBA. Once again, this one is obvious.Jayson Tatum really should have been one of the core members of the 2024 team. American Olympians usually only play once or twice before handing the baton to the next generation. Durant and LeBron James didn't do that last time, so that forced Tatum to the bench, where Steve Kerr seemingly determined that despite being a jack of all trades, he was not enough of a master at any single one to justify consistent specialist minutes off the bench. Well, with James presumably done competing for gold and Durant headed for the bench, Tatum's versatility alongside other stars suddenly looks a lot more valuable. Assuming he doesn't significantly decline as a result of his torn Achilles, he should still be a deserving starter. He was the best American forward in the NBA before he got hurt, and arguably the best overall American player.Cooper Flagg rounds out our core. We're admittedly doing some projecting here, but it feels relatively safe to do so. He's just the fourth rookie in NBA history to average 20 points, six rebounds and four assists. The first three were Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Luka Dončić. Odds are, he'll be a special player by his third season. His defensive versatility and competitiveness should fit in quite well here.So let's take stock here. In Cunningham, Edwards, Tatum and Flagg, we have an enormous set of starters in which our smallest player, Edwards, is 6-foot-4. Defensively, this foursome should be stellar and capable of pretty much any scheme Erik Spoelstra wants to run. There's plenty of playmaking here too. Cunningham currently trails only Nikola Jokić for the NBA lead in assists, and Tatum and Edwards have both averaged at least five assists per game in a season despite not playing point guard. Throw in Flagg's passing and you have a really balanced group that can all set one another up.\nIf it's lacking anywhere, it's probably shooting, and that's only a minor blemish. Cunningham is roughly a 34% shooter from deep, Flagg is at around 30%, and while Tatum is typically a reliable shooter, his jumper seemingly abandoned him during his last run with Team USA. Fortunately, we have a wide pool of American players to choose from to fill in that \"gap\" and round out the rest of the team. Let's start with the big men, who deserve their own category. Fortunately, there isn't really a shortage of American bigs who can shoot.The bigsOur first center choice is easy. We want a big who can shoot? Chet Holmgren is roughly a 37% 3-point shooter. Problem solved. That he's also a perpetual Defensive Player of the Year candidate is a nice bonus. He's not a great rebounder, but having Tatum and Flagg at forward should help offset that minor deficiency, and besides, we have two more big slots at our disposal here. We can stylistically cherrypick from this point on.Rebounding largely fits into the broader need for physicality. Serbia gave Team USA its biggest test in 2024, so winning in 2028 means having an answer for Nikola Jokić. Alperen Sengun, Domantas Sabonis and Giannis Antetokounmpo loom as possible opponents here as well, and though he plays differently, Team USA needs as many stylistic options as it can find to throw at Victor Wembanyama. So for our second big slot, we're looking for a bit of heft.\nThis isn't something the American hoops pipeline tends to deliver much anymore, but we fortunately have a pretty straightforward choice here. It's Jalen Duren. He comes with baked in chemistry with Cunningham, he rebounds, and although the sample in the modern NBA is always going to be fairly small, his numbers defending the post have by and large been excellent. Over the past three seasons, he has been in the 75th percentile or better at post up points allowed per possession. Again, tiny sample, but it checks out. When you're as strong as Duren, you're probably going to be tough to score on near the basket.The third spot comes down to two names, and they're pretty similar players. Both Bam Adebayo and Evan Mobley are enormously versatile defensive big men who have improved meaningfully as shooters in recent years and can create some of their own looks. The standard aging curve would suggest that Mobley, who will be 27 when the Olympics roll around, is likely to be better at that point than Adebayo, who will be 31. He might even be better now. But Erik Spoelstra is coaching this team, and he's probably going to lean toward the player he's more comfortable with, which would surely be the one he's coached in Miami for almost a decade now. It wouldn't hurt to have a bit more Olympic experience on this roster, so Adebayo's 2024 run is a plus as well. If it's a tie or close to it, he's probably going to win. If he's declined at all by then, though, Mobley is ready to go.The supporting castSo right now, we have eight spots locked up: Durant, Cunningham, Edwards, Tatum, Flagg, Holmgren, Duren and Adebayo. There are three pretty straightforward roles we need to fill with our four remaining slots: backup point guard, designated shooter and designated defender.\nTyrese Maxey is our backup point guard. His speed and shooting contrasts nicely with the bigger Cunningham, giving Team USA a curveball to throw at opposing bench lineups. The name of the game here is versatility, and Cunningham and Maxey just complement each other perfectly.Kon Knueppel is the clear designated shooter choice. He's leading the NBA in made 3-pointers as a rookie. He's averaging eight 3-point attempts per game, and the only players to shoot a higher percentage from deep on that volume in a season are Stephen Curry and Duncan Robinson. He's on track to succeed Curry as the best shooter in the NBA, so if we're looking for one, pure shooter for the roster, he's our guy.Amen Thompson is our defensive specialist. This was the trickiest choice. He just checked the most boxes. He's perhaps the NBA's best athlete, he's 6-foot-7 with a seven-foot wingspan so he's positionally versatile, and FIBA's whistle should be very kind to him given how physically he likes to play.We'll get into some of the other players I considered for those slots in the snub section, but for now, we have one last slot to fill. It's a tricky one. There's no specific need we're looking to address here. We've checked every positional box, and because of how big some of our guards are, there's not really an impetus to seek out size here either. It's just a matter of picking the best available American player.Now, this could change in the next two years, but I believe at this point the best available American player is Donovan Mitchell. He'll be closing in on his 32nd birthday by then, so decline is a real possibility, but he still hasn't played and 2028 will probably be his last realistic chance. He's a seven-time NBA All-Star. Every other active player to be chosen to that many All-Star teams has at least been chosen by Team USA, though Kawhi Leonard dropped out due to injury. He finished fifth in MVP voting last year and just ranked seventh in ESPN's latest MVP straw poll for this season. Only two Americans finished above him, Cunningham and someone we'll get to in a moment. Purely as an individual, he is the most accomplished American player without a gold medal.So Mitchell is the pick to round out the roster. That leaves us with the following 12-man team...\nThe final rosterPoint guardCade CunninghamShooting guardAnthony EdwardsSmall forwardJayson TatumPower forwardCooper FlaggCenterChet HolmgrenGuardTyrese MaxeyGuardDonovan MitchellGuardKon KnueppelForwardAmen ThompsonForwardKevin DurantCenterBam AdebayoCenterJalen DurenThe snubsSo, we mentioned one other American player who just outranked Mitchell in the MVP straw poll. That would be Jaylen Brown. In pure basketball terms, he would be a reasonable choice. He's having the best season of his career, he played for Team USA in the FIBA World Cup, and our roster does lean a bit more toward guards than forwards.Ultimately, the prediction was informed by two factors. The first is that I simply think Mitchell is slightly better. In the best year of Brown's career, he and Mitchell are still basically even in terms of scoring volume. Brown is the better defender given his size, but Mitchell is a better playmaker, is more efficient and beats Brown in most of the all-in-one metrics pretty meaningfully. They're close enough that if there was a specific need for something Brown did, he'd be a fair choice. But if that were the case, we would have carved out a specialist slot for him and we didn't.The other factor was politics. Brown criticized Team USA in 2024 for his belief that it allows Nike influence over roster decisions. Whether that's true or not, it's a headache Team USA would probably prefer to avoid. If we were talking about a foundational part of USA Basketball, that would be one thing, but for one of the last slots on the roster, the tie is probably going to go to someone else.The other candidate for the final, \"best available American player\" slot was Jalen Williams. He's not the individual creator Brown is, but he's a better defender and on the right side of the aging curve. He's having a down year as he recovers from a wrist injury, but it's reasonable to assume that he'll at least bounce back to the level he played at last season, when he was an All-NBA choice. If USA Basketball wants a forward for this last slot, he's the easy pick. But in a tie, I'm giving the edge to the older player. Williams will have more chances.Backup point guard was a nightmare. Tyrese Haliburton was on the 2024 team, though he barely played. Jalen Brunson missed the cut, and he reportedly wants another shot in 2028. Either would have been worthy choices. But the guard pool is so deep that, with two years out, I'm inclined not to gamble on what Haliburton looks like post-Achilles tear. I'm a bit more comfortable with Tatum, a forward, looking mostly like himself after that injury compared to Haliburton, a guard. Brunson is the oldest of the three, right in the same range as Mitchell, but his playing style is a bit more tailored to the NBA given his mid-range mastery and defensive vulnerability at his size. Both were agonizing cuts, especially given how well Haliburton's passing fits into the FIBA game, but we only have 12 spots.Devin Booker didn't really fit into a neat box, but he was another brutal cut considering how well he played in 2024. But Mitchell has outplayed him for several years now, and we've now had two full seasons of subpar 3-point shooting out of Booker, so he wasn't going to get any consideration in the designated shooter slot. He's not beating players off of the dribble quite as easily anymore either, so I'd be a bit concerned with how he'll look in two-and-a-half years.I could have gone in so many different directions for the designated defender slot. Jalen Suggs isn't durable enough. Herb Jones doesn't do enough offensively. Alex Caruso is too old. Cason Wallace is too small. The two players that most seriously challenged Amen Thompson were his brother Ausar and Stephon Castle. In the end, Amen's offensive advantage over his brother and his slight size advantage over Castle were the tiebreakers. Castle is certainly better on offense than Thompson, though, and if either of them can just get to passable as a 3-point shooter, that would make picking a winner easier. Speaking of shooting, that was what kept Scottie Barnes off the team. He could qualify as a defensive specialist, though he's obviously more well-rounded than that overall. This team just already has enough of what he does offensively, and Thompson is an easier fit in the on-ball defensive role we're looking to fill.The only other big man I gave any consideration to was Walker Kessler. He hasn't played much this season due to injury, but he played for Team USA in the 2023 World Cup and he checks the same size and physicality boxes that Duren does. Duren's growth into an All-Star this season made him the clear choice for this role on the team, but I'm keeping an eye on Kessler just on the faint hope that his experiments with 3-point shooting ever bear fruit. If he ever learns to shoot at his size, he'd be a great FIBA player, so watch out over the next two years.And then there are the youngsters. I don't think Reed Sheppard is going to catch Knueppel, but he was a similarly gifted college shooter. The 2025 draft class is promising enough that some of these players, like Cedric Coward or Derik Queen, may be heard from in the years to come. And of course, we have three enormously promising American youngsters coming in June in Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa and Cam Boozer. Making the team after only two years as a professional is rare, but not unheard of. Keldon Johnson made the cut after his rookie season in 2020, and Anthony Davis played for Team USA before he even played in the NBA. Neither played major roles in the Olympics, but both won gold medals, so we can't rule the upcoming rookies out.\n            ",

Both teams have plenty of work to do in order to ensure a return to the last 16. Atletico Madrid, meanwhile, are deadlocked with Club Brugge after an entertaining 3-3 draw in Belgium last week, each side with a reasonable chance to advance.This week's action will also be a consequential week for Italy, as each of its remaining clubs is in danger of dropping out of the competition. Inter's clash with Bodo/Glimt will take center stage on Tuesday, while Atalanta will host Borussia Dortmund, each side carrying a two-goal disadvantage into their home legs. Juventus, meanwhile, host Galatasaray on Wednesday and are tasked with reversing a three-goal deficit after their unraveling in Istanbul last week.Here's what the CBS Sports team is predicting for a busy week in Europe's top club competition.\nDon't miss any of the Champions League.

And yet their win over Napoli at the weekend was a sign of the cocktail of composure and quality that should give this team a fighting chance.  Pardeep Cattry: Bodo/Glimt -- While last week's 3-1 win over Inter came as a surprise, Bodo/Glimt have gone from strength to strength over the last year, learning how to navigate the challenges of European competition along the way. They have frazzled the likes of Manchester City, Atletico Madrid and now Inter in a matter of a few short weeks, creating a comfortable advantage as they travel to Milan and take on a team in desperate need of goals, but one may not be able to count on their top goalscorer to pitch in. The odds may still be in Inter's favor, but there's more than a small chance that Glimt can see things out in Italy, teasing an upset for the ages.  Francesco Porzio: Borussia Dortmund --I expected Atalanta to be the favourites in the playoff against the German side, but Borussia Dortmund claimed a 2–0 victory in the first leg at home, shifting the balance of the tie. It will now be a significant challenge for Raffaele Palladino's team to come back at the New Balance Arena in Bergamo on Tuesday. Despite their weekend Serie A win over Napoli, overturning a two-goal deficit against a side of Dortmund's caliber will require an outstanding performance.\n Chuck Booth: None? -- While technically Galatasaray should advance as underdogs, they never should've actually been considered to be underdogs in my opinion. The knockout stages are usually where feel-good stories come to an end, which brings us to Bodo/Glimt facing Inter. On the turf of their home stadium, Bodo have one of the biggest advantages of any European side at their home stadium, and even without Lautaro Martinez available, Inter will be able to turn this around. Favorites who will crash outJames Benge: Inter -- Even as Bodo/Glimt were celebrating perhaps the greatest European win in their history, you could feel the skepticism bubbling up inside yourself. Sure, Kjetil Knutsen's side did what they so often do on (artificial) home turf, but it would all fall apart under the bright lights of the San Siro. I'm not so sure. Bodo/Glimt are a decent counterattacking team and might have the energy and organisation to disrupt Inter. Also, as I understand it, Norwegians have been quite successful in the Milan area lately.  Pardeep Cattry: Juventus -- Last week was not a great one for Italy, and while Inter can still plot a path to the round of 16, Juventus may have dug themselves into a hole that's too deep to get out of. Luciano Spalletti's tactical innovations in attack have helped Juventus over the course of the season but it may not be enough against Galatasaray, who have a three-goal advantage and boast two talented goalscorers in Victor Osimhen and Mauro Icardi. The tie is now officially Galatasaray's to lose, and with their first round of 16 berth in 12 years within their reach, they probably won't throw it away now.  Francesco Porzio: Juventus -- The Bianconeri were expected to advance against Galatasaray despite playing the first match away, and that clash became a nightmare for the team coached by Luciano Spalletti, that lost 5-2. It will be a big challenge for Juventus to make a comeback in the second leg in Turin on Wednesday with Turkish talent Kenan Yildiz in doubt to play the second leg due to a minor injury.   Chuck Booth: Juventus -- No Gleison Bremer, no party. While there's a chance that the Brazilian defender may be available for this match, he's the heartbeat of the Juventus defense and needs to be at the peak of his powers for them to have a chance. Needing to win by three goals to even force extra time, this is a mountain that will be too high to climb, even with the match taking place in Turin.Game of the weekJames Benge: Atletico Madrid vs. Club Brugge -- Yeah, it might not have the superstar talent or the European Cup-winning pedigree, but Diego Simeone's side against a team they're expected to beat in this competition tends to mean one thing over these last few years: gripping psychodrama. This one is going to be tense and potentially error-prone. Secretly, that's what we all want.  Pardeep Cattry: Atletico Madrid vs. Club Brugge -- If last week's 3-3 draw in Belgium was anything to go by, Atletico Madrid and Club Brugge's meeting in the Spanish capital just might be the most fun match of the week. Each side has a well-documented ability to score goals and will come to the matchup with a vulnerable defense that should be easy for the opposing attack to take advantage of. Add to that the fact that both teams actually need to score on Tuesday, and, fingers crossed, we may just end up with a jam-packed match. Francesco Porzio: Real Madrid vs. Benfica -- All the eyes will be on the Bernabeu where Real Madrid will host Benfica for the second leg after the disgraceful incident that occurred last week in Lisbon between Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni and Vinicius Jr. The two will meet again on Wednesday in Madrid for what will be one of the most awaited clashes of the season, while Benfica manager and former Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho will be suspended after receiving a red card last week in Lisbon. \n Chuck Booth: Real Madrid vs. Benfica -- Some of the intrigue around this game may be for unfortunate reasons, considering the events that took place in Portugal, but given the performances on the pitch by Vinicus Junior as of late, he's box office viewing at this stage. With Goals in four consecutive matches, he's in his best form of the season and has a point to prove facing Benfica, even if Jose Mourinho won't be on the sidelines. This is one where Real will absolutely look to run up the score even if they can advance to the round of 16 with a draw.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown led all scorers in Sunday's 111-89 road rout of the Los Angeles Lakers with 32 points, and his performance prompted LeBron James to speak up for him as an NBA MVP candidate. While Brown ranks fourth in the league in scoring and is the face of a surprisingly successful Celtics squad, he stands behind numerous stars in the award race, and that is a reality that James cannot get behind.This has been a career year for Brown, whose 29.2 points per game are by far a personal high and who leads the league in field goal attempts per game.\"JB is playing great basketball, man,\" James said after the rivalry game. \"This whole MVP thing, I don't understand why his name is not getting talked about some, as well. Nobody gave them a shot to start the season. He's averaging, what, 30? Just under 30. It's a popularity contest sometimes.\"The only knock against Brown's production is that he is less efficient than some of his elite counterparts. His usage rate has spiked this year as he flourished into the Celtics' ringleader with Jayson Tatum out with a torn Achilles. Because his increased workload is such a large catalyst behind his elevated play, he ranks No. 12 in the NBA's efficiency metric, well behind the premier MVP contenders.That, and Brown's lack of superstar pedigree, are likely the most to blame for his sixth-place standing in the MVP race, per FanDuel odds.\nNBA MVP oddsShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder (-145)Nikola Jokić, Nuggets (+270)Cade Cunningham, Pistons (+650)Victor Wembanyama, Spurs (+2500)Luka Dončić, Lakers (+4000)Jaylen Brown, Celtics (+5000)Jaylen Brown's value goes beyond career-best scoring outputWhile Brown cannot compete with the likes of Jokić, Dončić and Gilgeous-Alexander from an efficiency standpoint, the value he brings to the Celtics is undeniably important for a team that seeks to contend in what was supposed to be a down year.In past years he was a prominent wingman to Tatum, but this season, Brown has proven an ability to put a franchise on his shoulders and lead it to championship contention. The Celtics are second in the Eastern Conference, while preseason projected win totals suggested they should have been in firm danger of missing the playoffs.\"I think he's just using motivation of a lot of people saying that they're going to have a down year because of JT being out, them losing Jrue [Holiday],\" James said. \"Al [Horford] leaves. [Kristaps] Porziņģis leaves. Their whole championship team pretty much is revamped. He uses that as motivation to keep them afloat. They're playing great basketball, and it's because of him and the rest of those guys. He's taken that next step.\"\nWhat's more, Brown has been highly available, playing 51 of the Celtics' 56 games. That is more than any of the MVP candidates who stand ahead of him on the odds board.\n            ",

The Falcons have until July 15 to sign Pitts to a contract. If he were to play on the tag in 2026, Pitts would make a fully-guaranteed $16,007,000, according to Spotrac. The Falcons are expected to have $26,462,519 in cap space, which ranks No. 15 in the NFL per Over The Cap. Jones also mentioned the possibility of Pitts being tagged and traded if there was a suitor that offered enticing-enough compensation. Atlanta's first selection in this upcoming draft comes at No. 48 overall.Pitts was considered to be one of the top tight ends set to hit free agency, headlining a list that includes Travis Kelce, David Njoku, Isaiah Likely, Dallas Goedert, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo. \nPitts is coming off a career year in which he caught 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns. He delivered what was the best outing of his NFL career during a Week 15 prime-time victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which he caught 11 of 12 targets from Kirk Cousins for 166 yards and three touchdowns. The Florida product made the Pro Bowl in 2021 after becoming the first rookie tight end to cross 1,000 yards receiving since Mike Ditka in 1961, and was named a Second Team All-Pro this past season. In 78 career games played, Pitts has caught 284 passes for 3,579 yards and 15 touchdowns. \nPitts is the second reported player to be in line to receive the franchise tag, joining Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. Running back Breece Hall of the New York Jets is another player to watch. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Phoenix Suns have been one of the NBA's best stories this season, and Dillon Brooks has been at the heart of it. He's scoring at a rate (and in ways) we've never seen from him before on any kind of a consistent basis. He's defending, as always. His competitive prints are all over one of the grittiest teams in the league. And now he has a broken hand.There are bummers and there are bummers. This is the latter. Here's to hoping Brooks can get back in time for the playoffs/Play-In tournament (ESPN reports he'll be out 4-6 weeks), but in the meantime the Suns, who are also without Devin Booker (hip strain) for at least the next week, need to find a way to replace at least some of Brooks' 21 points per game. The natural next man for that job would be Jalen Green, who also came over from Houston with Brooks in the Kevin Durant trade. You're forgiven if you forgot Green even played for the Suns. He's missed most of the season with a hamstring issue that has refused to fully repair. But he's back and healthy (for) now. He had 26 points and four 3-pointers against San Antonio coming out of the All-Star break. On Saturday, he made up for a miserable shooting night by knocking down a fading corner 3 at the buzzer to beat the Magic in overtime. \nGreen is an electric athlete who had a legitimate superstar stretch last season in Houston, but he's never been a consistent shooter or anything close to an efficient scorer on the whole. He's only 24, but he's making $33.5 million. Next year that number rises to $36.2 million, and the year after that he has a $36 million player option as the first player to ever sign a 2+1 rookie extension on a nine-figure contract. It's a lot of money if Green doesn't pan out. But if he does, it has a chance to become a team-friendly deal. He's not going to defend like Brooks, if at all. He's not going to go to work in the post. But he'll never have a better opportunity to prove his value than right now, with the Suns badly in need of anyone who can contribute to the cause of recreating Brooks' production in the aggregate, particularly as a self creator. One of the notable strides Brooks has made this year is as a guy who can get buckets on his own; over 55% of his field goals have been unassisted. For better or worse, this is what Green does. Last season 63% of his non-garbage-time buckets were unassisted (that was the highest percentage for any wing in the league, per Cleaning the Glass). \nAgain, it's never been efficient. And so far it hasn't been with the Suns. On Sunday, Green cooked up a donut in the first half of Phoenix's loss to Portland and finished 1 of 7 from 3. So far this season he's averaging 13.3 points and shooting 38% from the field over 10 games. Small and randomized sample notwithstanding, that's obviously not going to cut it. \nBut don't be fooled, there is a big-time-scorer version of Jalen Green that is going to come out, and the Suns need it to be sooner than later. The dream of him turning into the actual superstar his talent theoretically suggests he could be is almost surely dead, but the question remains whether he can be winning player on a winning team. We've seen in in stretches, but the Rockets, all told, were more than eight points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor last season, per CTG. He's probably regarded as a negative asset at this point with $70 million in guaranteed money still on the books, but winning looks good on everyone. He's playing for another contract, be it in Phoenix or elsewhere. \nThese next six weeks aren't do-or-die for Green; he'll have a big opportunity next season, as well. But it has to start now. NBA perceptions can become sort of irreversible at some point, and Green is toeing that line as the dreaded empty-stats scorer. It just so happens that the Suns -- who are just two games back of the No. 6 Timberwolves with one head-to-head remaining and the tiebreaker already secured, but are also just two games up on the No. 8 Warriors -- are not in a position to consider any scoring stat empty without Brooks. They scored 77 points on Sunday. They need every bucket they can get. And if there's one thing Green can do, it's get buckets. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Champions League is back, and come Friday morning we will at last have a shape for how this is all going to work out. Between now and then is the small matter of rounding out the field for the last 16. For plenty of the big sides there is work to do with Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid holding onto one goal leads and Atletico Madrid licking their wounds after a 3-3 draw.The biggest pressure is on the Serie A giants however. Last year's finalists Inter returned from Bodo/Glimt having been utterly chastened in a 3-1 loss that has their Champions League hopes on the brink.

Is Osimhen a top five striker in the world?Without wishing to state the obvious, the very best center forwards in the world tend to be the ones who score the most. You might get the odd Roberto Firmino type whose qualities lie in facilitation, but if you wear the No. 9 shirt (or one whose digits add up to nine), you'd best be putting the ball in the onion bag. Move to the very best of the very best, though, and you enter the class of players who can deliver all the goals you need but still, on those rare off days, bend a big contest to their will without scoring. A prime reference point for that might be Victor Osimhen's obliterating of Juventus in a 5-2 win that will almost certainly have Galatasaray in the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in 12 years.\nWhat was funny about the devastation wrought by Osimhen on his former boss Luciano Spalletti was that it really didn't show up on a cursory glance at the stats sheet. Three shots for 0.13 xG, 11 of 18 passes completed, no chances created. You're telling me this is the guy you're considering placing behind Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe in the pantheon of center forwards, maybe on a par with Ousmane Dembele and Harry Kane? Dig a little deeper though and you see something. Ten touches in the opposition box is usually the sort of number a Champions League striker registers when they're on the positive end of a severe talent mismatch. The 0.41 expected assists is pretty sprightly too, though Opta does not have any assists logged for the Nigerian international. Check UEFA's data and you will find two and it was those moments that typified the chaos Osimhen created both before and after Juventus went down to 10 men. His pressing was ferocious, his commitment in the duels relentless. Gabriel Sara's opener would not have come about if Osimhen hadn't sensed a heavy touch by Kenan Yildiz and hit him hard. Galatasaray's fourth is the poacher's instinct of a striker reinterpreted for when the other team has possession. Lurking on the blind side, waiting for the moment when Juventus think they can breath because the initial wave of pressure has crashed against them. They never see Osimhen coming.\nSuch elite off ball play tends to be one of the first things that goes when strikers enter the pantheon of the best on earth. So many reason that they need to save their energy for what they do best. You would figure the intensity would drop off even more when a player moves out of Europe's top five leagues to the sort of environment he can dominate at 80% energy. And yet Osimhen averages an incredibly impressive 1.75 interceptions per 90 minutes in the Super Lig this season, four times what Mbappe, for instance, does for Real Madrid in league play. It translates on the European stage too. Only eight players win possession in the attacking third more frequently than Osimhen has in this season's Champions League. All that is to say nothing for how he holds possession when he gets it, bringing others into play.As for the thing that really matters for strikers, you know that Osimhen delivers on that front. Perhaps not quite with the consistency of last year but 15 goals in 23 games is not to be sniffed at, all the more so when six of them have come in the Champions League. There might not have been any in his last four games but there is no shame in struggling to find the net against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid, particularly when even after Galatasaray's recent aggressive investment they are not a club that can go toe to toe with those sides on talent terms.So Osimhen then is quite clearly one of Europe's outstanding strikers, right? Well probably, when he's fit. That has been the recurring problem for the 27-year-old, who missed the weekend's defeat to Konyaspor with a knee injury. He is said to be a doubt for the trip to Turin too, albeit he is expected to travel. Per Transfermarkt, this was the eighth separate injury he has suffered since leaving Napoli, initially on loan, at the start of last season. They say availability is the best ability. Whether that is or isn't the case (it isn't), it might be the only one a striker needs that Osimhen is missing.\n2. Can Bodo/Glimt see out their upset on the road?So, how much of Bodo/Glimt's stunning 3-1 win over Inter was down to what is probably the most significant home field advantage in the Champions League this season. The artificial turf and freezing temperatures have been a pretty helpful swing factor against not just Inter but Manchester City, Lazio and Porto in the last 18 months. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, Bodo/Glimt have a European record at the Aspmyra Stadion that can stand up against all but the continent's superteams: 19 wins, two draws and nine defeats. That's a smidge under two points per game. Their opponents, twice Champions League finalists in that same time period, average exactly two.And so Bodo/Glimt's win was one we might have seen coming, but was it enough? Because as good as the Norwegian champions are at home, their road record is pretty abysmal: seven wins, 14 draws and 19 defeats. Most notably they seem to struggle when travelling for knockout games. There are isolated periods of success, winning against Celtic in Glasgow and getting the result they needed away to AZ in the 2021-22 Conference League. The following year the giants of Bohemians and Pyunik fell at home to Bodo/Glimt but not a lot else. Across their last 40 away European matches a goal difference of -20 is bad but it could have been so much worse, their non-penalty xG difference is -29.36. Historically they're three-quarters of a goal per game worse than their opponents on the road and most of those opponents are not Inter.So historically Bodo/Glimt have the look of a team that could very plausibly cede a two goal lead to a European juggernaut. But this isn't 2021-22 Bodo/Glimt. Their money-spinning runs through the Europa League have not only allowed this club to recruit and retain Norwegian stars like Frederik Bjorkan and Kasper Hogh, but to bring back the likes of Patrick Berg and Jens Petter Hauge after moves to the big five leagues. As their manager Kjetil Knutsen explained, this is a team that have only improved from their many trips across the continent.\n\"I really believe in our identity and in the work we do over time,\" he said. \"That [way] it becomes second nature, there's loyalty, and a culture where we trust the quality we have within the team. We've also been extremely fortunate because we've been in the Europa [League] over a sustained period, facing stronger and stronger opposition. Both personally and as a [coaching] team, we've trusted the process.\"The current iteration shouldn't be written off as just a side who do the business at home. Kjetil Knutsen's men took five points on their travels in the league phase, the memorable win against Atletico Madrid following draws at Borussia Dortmund and Slavia Prague, the latter a fighting performance to overturn a two goal deficit in the final 12 minutes. Most worryingly of all for Inter, Bodo/Glimt are proving themselves to be a team who can execute in the particular scenario ahead of them. Four of their 17 goals in this season's Champions League have come on the counter attack, a tally bettered only by Real Madrid and they average a breakout that ends in a shot once per game. If they can just convert that moment when it comes their way, they will set Inter an almighty task.3. Will Mbappe break Ronaldo's single season scoring record?Even with the new Champions League format exposing players to as many as four extra games in the competition, it feels remarkable that before spring has sprung Kylian Mbappe finds himself so close to what once seemed an unbreakable Champions League record. The 17 goals that Cristiano Ronaldo hammered home in the 2013-14 competition included a healthy dose of group stage output against lesser opposition and some thundering beatdowns on the likes of Schalke, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid. Thereafter only Ronaldo got within one again and those who even sniffed it were the best striker in the world in the form of their lives (Robert Lewandowski in 2019-20 and Karim Benzema two years later).\nKylian Mbappe might be the first of those things, only time will tell if the latter is true. What he is not, for the moment at least, is at the head of an all-conquering attack like those led by Lewandowski, Benzema and Ronaldo. Even so he needs just four more goals to match the single season scoring record in this competition.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            You suspect a player averaging 5.7 shots and 0.73 non-penalty xG per 90 will back himself to add a few more against Benfica this week, who have given up nine shots to Mbappe in two games so far in the competition. What bodes best for him in this Champions League iteration is that he has had that very Ronaldo-ish quality of scoring in bunches: two against Monaco, three on Kairat, four against Olympiacos.The only question is whether Madrid can go far enough in this competition to allow Mbappe to get up to and ahead of his predecessor. Much will depend on Friday's draw, assuming Los Merengues are in it. If Madrid drop on Manchester City's side then we are in crapshoot territory, two sides that have hardly inspired great faith in their Champions League chops duking it out once more in games that are reliably incomprehensible. The other option though is Sporting and while any team that has beaten PSG and won in Bilbao will deserve Madrid's respect, they will also have plenty to fear from an in form Mbappe. Get this guy to the quarterfinals and he might already have delivered the greatest scoring season this competition has seen.\n            ",

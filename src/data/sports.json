    "body": "\n        The 2026 Peach Bowl will see Big Ten teams squaring off on Friday as the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers face the No. 5 Oregon Ducks. This 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal contest is a rematch of a mid-October game in which the Hoosiers prevailed on the road, 30-20. That remains the only loss for the 13-1 Ducks, who are coming off a dominant 23-0 shutout win over Texas Tech. As for the 14-0 Hoosiers, they are coming off a 38-3 blowout of Alabama and have aspirations of becoming the first 16-0 team in college football history.Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds per SportsLine consensus. The over/under for total points is 48.5, having risen 2 points since the opening line.

The Ducks have also covered at at 75% clip as an underdog since 2023, while IU is just 5-4 ATS over its last nine versus Big Ten teams. On the field, Oregon possesses the better offense both on the ground and through the air. The Ducks average more passing yards than Indiana, with a higher completion percentage, in addition to averaging more rushing yards, as well as more yards per carry. On the other side of the ball, Oregon is coming off a season-high of four takeaways in the win over Texas Tech, and the Ducks had a pick-six of Fernando Mendoza in the first contest. Mendoza has also been under pressure as of late as he's been sacked three-plus times in four of his last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Indiana can coverNo one can match Indiana's production on both sides of the ball, as it has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 3 scoring offense, and no other FBS team ranks in the top five of both. The Hoosiers have allowed two touchdowns, total, over their last four games, and they've given up a rushing touchdown in just one of their last nine games. Mendoza leads the nation with both 36 passing touchdowns and with a 184.7 passer rating, and Indiana isn't the type of team that hurts itself. Just one team in all of college football commits fewer penalty yards per game, while just two teams in the country commit fewer turnovers per game.

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- It should probably be no surprise that, since the start of his first full season in charge, no team has attempted more pullbacks than Mikel Arteta's Arsenal. The Spaniard had been pruned off Pep Guardiola's coaching tree at just the right moment, departing a team that were all about stretching play in behind their opponents, cutting the ball back for an onrushing midfielder to crash home. No one doubts that Manchester City's head coach was the architect of this seemingly unstoppable approach, but Arteta was widely credited as having a helping hand, particularly in his work with Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling.On Thursday night, Arsenal's ability to get to the byline and fire the ball into dangerous areas was in full effect. Opta logged two such passes, fizzed low balls across the box from Leandro Trossard and Bukayo Saka in the first 20 minutes, but such deliveries can be in the eye of the beholder. Before Saka, Jurrien Timber had snuck to the byline to deliver. Declan Rice's tempter from the left channel was definitely not a cutback but it asked the same questions of his teammates: who was going to gamble on getting a toe on the ball? Noni Madueke did the same.What really isn't a question of categorization is the end outcome of these many balls that flew down Liverpool's corridor of uncertainty. No shots. That is a waste given that Arsenal were so well set up to exploit overlaps. Their full backs roamed across the field looking for a give-and-go, with Jurrien Timber particularly shrewd in his manipulation of man markers. Cody Gakpo and Alexis Mac Allister found themselves splitting shifts on the Arsenal right back. In response Timber might drag Gakpo into central midfield, creating the wrong sort of defensive overload, one that both manufactured space for Saka to operate in and opened up an angle for him to receive an underlapping pass.Arsenal were really good at getting to the sorts of prime positions you can see below and quite poor at exploiting them. To hear Arteta explain it, the fault lied with those picking out the pass. \"We were much closer to that with the amount of situations and the spaces that we arrived into, normally you have to pick somebody in the box and it's a goal,\" he said.\nAfter a fine run to the byline, Bukayo Saka picks out Florian Wirtz with four Arsenal team mates attacking the box \n                                                                    Premier League\n                                                            \"The movement was there, the arrival was there, the players were there,\" he added, though he somewhat contradicted himself by continuing, \"there are two or three that they come across and we need to occupy a space that we didn't occupy to score the ball.\"Sometimes the ball didn't arrive. Normally we're going to the six yard box almost with the ball at our feet, and normally that's a goal, you pick somebody and you score a goal, and we didn't do that, and that's the thing today, we have to improve.\"Arteta would insist that his team have had games when they have got their passes right around the box, pointing to the 4-1 win over Aston Villa as a moment of particular excellence. \"That's why you win those big matches,\" he said, \"and today we missed that.\"\nThe curious factor is that it isn't just on Thursday night that Arsenal have been a little bit off with their cutbacks and low deliveries into the box. It has rather felt like one of the few negative traits that has stuck with this team throughout the season, that they are getting into positions to make these passes even more than last season and doing less with them. Indeed, so far in 2025-26 they have attempted 32 passes that Opta has logged as pullbacks from their 21 games, a rate of over 1.5 per match that is tracking to a level they have only bettered once.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            In 2023-24 they attempted 72 such passes and scored eight goals. Some of that came from xG overperformance but they were certainly getting themselves more good shots than they have in 2025-26. The graph above shows the problem. You will not find a team in the Premier League this season who have been better at making cut back chances for themselves but Arsenal are only a smidge over the middle of the pack in terms of the expected goals value they are creating in this prime attacking real estate.Some of the explanation for the season as a whole might be what Arteta was referring to last night, players not getting the pass right. One of the reasons why Arsenal were so devastating in these scenarios two years ago was the interplay of Martin Odegaard, Saka and Ben White, the latter establishing himself as one of the game's outstanding attacking right backs. Arsenal's No.4 seemed utterly in sync with the rest of the attacking pod on the right flank and could use the threat of Saka coming inside to find even more space towards the byline.\nInjuries have hit White hard over the last 18 months, but fortunately for Arsenal his replacement might have been even better. There are few defenders who can lock down a flank like Timber and this season has seen the Dutch international stretch his attacking muscles even more. The positions he took up on Thursday night seemed designed to maximize difficulty for his man markers and his stretching runs in behind were a continual nuisance for Liverpool.To have been more than that, his delivery needed to be better. For a player who has come so far in so long it seems fair to suggest that passing like the below, a looped cross in the vague direction of Piero Hincapie but not in a position to really threaten anyone, will be ironed out with more reps.Timber's cross from the right doesn't find a red shirt with Liverpool giving up a lot of space in dangerous areas \n                                                                    Premier League\n                                                            It is not quite so easy to feel the same about Viktor Gyokeres. The obvious explanation for why Arsenal are trying to be more of a cutback team is probably be that this season they thought they were adding the fox in the box that they had supposedly needed for so long. Why then is their No.14 yet to get a shot from a pullback in a Premier League game?\nSquint hard enough and you can make a case for Gyokeres. When Saka went probing around the 20th minute his movement to the back post took Ibrahima Konate out of position, opening up space for others. These are the sorts of things that Arsenal fans are hearing a lot when it comes to Gyokeres. Declan Rice has been pointing out to the strength and industry he has been showing in the build up to goals, which is not untrue. Arteta was keen to talk up the \"great positions\" his summer signing found against Liverpool. Maybe there's a case to be made that in that image above Gyokeres is doing the right thing. His run takes Ibrahima Konate to the back post, where the ball is going. It opens up space that Leandro Trossard and Martin Odegaard should be more aggressive in filling. There's a question to ask about why Odegaard wasn't attacking those spaces off pullbacks as he was a few years ago, but right now the focus needs to be on Gyokeres.  It is absolutely valid if part of a striker's repertoire is to make space for others. Erling Haaland has rightly won praise this season for how he uses his gravitational force to manoeuvre the opposition and create space for his teammates. It's just that Haaland gets lots of shots and goals. Right now Gyokeres is delivering little of either. Last night was the seventh Premier League game where the Swede failed to take a shot. He has played 19. Since the start of November he has put a shot on target on four occasions in the competition, one a penalty against Everton.\nMuch of the debate around Gyokeres' form has been whether Arsenal are playing in a way that suits him. He will never get the transition opportunities that the Portuguese league afforded him and he will rarely if ever find himself in the sort of talent mismatch that his old club Sporting CP have in many weekends. But his teammates have been pushing the pace in their attacks this season, they do look to release him with quick balls into the channel.Gyokeres is just not getting to them. Go back to that first image. Which of the quartet of Arsenal players look least favorably positioned if the cutback comes to them? Probably the striker, who has not managed to get any meaningful separation from Konate. That was the story of his night. Yes he was dragging a Liverpool center back around the penalty area but to what end result?It might even be the story of his season. Until that big goal comes maybe the defining moment of his season is him by the power of Grayskull-ing his penalty against Everton, or maybe it's him berating Bukayo Saka because he didn't get the ball passed to him against Brighton.\nThere is no disputing that Gyokeres can use his gravity and running power to good effect even when he doesn't have the ball. When he does and lays it off nicely, as he did for Rice's goal against Bournemouth, it makes Arsenal a better attacking team. The simple truth, though, is that you don't commit $85 million for off-ball running, space creation and less than two and a half shots per 90. If you're dialing up your attacks from the byline, perhaps that is because you're trying to create opportunities to exploit your new striker's ability to kick the ball very hard and very precisely into the goal. It is hard to see how that is going to happen if he is stuck behind a defender at the far post.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        GLENDALE, Ariz. — Carson Beck looked left, he looked right and then he saw a clear path out of the desert and back home.Nearly one year to the day he surprised the sport -- and irked Georgia fans -- by reneging on the NFL Draft to instead transfer to Miami, the quarterback scrambled three yards into the end zone and scored the decisive touchdown against Ole Miss with 18 seconds remaining in the Fiesta Bowl. The legacy-defining play lifted the Hurricanes into the national championship game for the first time in 24 years.\"Man,\" Beck said, \"what an unbelievable year. It was never easy. It was never perfect. There were a lot of ups and downs. There was a lot of adversity that not only I faced individually, but that we faced as a team.\"The Hurricanes (13-2) traversed arguably the most difficult path in the playoffs, defeating three higher-seeded teams to advance to the championship. Their reward? They will be the first team in the 27-year era of the BCS/CFP to play for a national title inside their home stadium. \n\"We haven't been home in a long time,\" Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. \"We've been on the road for five straight games.\"Miami keeps winning because it has proven to be the most physical, violent team remaining in the playoff. The Hurricanes have bullied every opponent in the trenches. On Thursday night, they played keep-away from Ole Miss' high-powered, fast-paced offense -- running 88 plays over 41 minutes, the largest time-of-possession disparity in CFP history. Miami converted a playoff-record 11 third downs, including a critical completion on the final drive, and rushed for 191 yards behind a ferocious offensive line.Beck led back-to-back, 75-yard touchdown drives to cap the 31-27 win against No. 6 Ole Miss after coming up scoreless on five straight possessions. \n\"it almost seems like the tougher it gets, the better we play,\" Cristobal said. \"And it's a testament to them -- to their resilience, and their will.\"Beck connected on seven of his final 12 passes for 85 yards after throwing a momentum-changing interception that helped set up a go-ahead Ole Miss touchdown. He fired back with a 36-yard touchdown pass to freshman phenom Malachi Toney and scored again on his game-winning scramble.\"I'm sure a lot of people thought we were screwed there a lot of times. Then again, we've got an absolute game-changer at quarterback,\" Miami center James Brockermeyer said. \"He's the reason we got it done at the end.\"\nBeck has been one of the sport's most hot-button players in recent years, a popular target for critics and rival fans. His path has included an interception-laden final season at Georgia that ended with an injury in the SEC Championship Game and an internet-friendly relationship with Miami women's basketball player Hanna Cavinder that drew headlines and social media attention. Through it all, the quarterback navigated landmines -- some of his own making -- to reach the national championship game for the third time in his career, but for the first time as a starting quarterback.He sat behind Stetson Bennett as the Bulldogs reached the title game in 2021 and 2022, but couldn't do the same as the starter in 2023 and 2024, raising questions about his leadership and talent. In his final season, he threw 12 interceptions (the most by a Georgia quarterback in 12 years) and his receivers dropped 30 passes, the most in the FBS.\"He should feel vindicated,\" Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson told CBS Sports. \"His record against top-10 opponents is as good as anybody, and he deals with a lot of criticism from a lot of people. He's a little bit misunderstood.\"\nIndeed, the numbers paint the picture of an elite competitor. Beck enters the national championship game 37-5 as a starter, the second-most wins over a three-year period in FBS history. He's an unmatched 16-3 against ranked opponents, which includes seven wins this season, and he has led eight comebacks in the fourth quarter.\"This was his moment and he stepped up,\" Dawson said, as he watched Beck enjoy a shower of gold confetti inside State Farm Stadium. \"Good for him. He deserves it. He silenced a lot of critics, but we've got one more to go.\"Indeed, Beck is a popular target, because of his notoriety and his reportedly rich NIL contract ($4 million and potentially $6 million with incentives). No one cried when his luxury vehicle was stolen in the spring. If anything, they made him a punchline. They obsessed over his dating life, poking fun at him when his relationship with Cavinder ended.\nStill, Miami coaches and players share stories of a misunderstood superstar, one they admittedly once believed seemed aloof before he arrived in Miami last January.\"He really doesn't care too much about what people say about him,\" said Toney, who caught five passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. \"He's about his business.\"\"There's all these weird narratives about the guy,\" Brockermeyer said. \"You meet him, and you're just like, what the crap are these people talking about? He's an awesome dude, a hell of a competitor, a great teammate and a great friend. I love the guy to death.\"\nBeck absorbed four sacks, but was more willing to run than at any point this season. He finished with minus-6 yards but took off seven times, including the scramble to win the game, his first rushing score since Week 3. Dawson said scrambling has been a point of emphasis for Beck in the playoffs.Up next is a happy flight home to Miami, and a few more practices at the famed Greentree practice fields in Coral Gables. Miami awaits Indiana or Oregon in the national championship game at Hard Rock Stadium.Funny, three of Miami's five previous national titles were secured by winning games at the Orange Bowl. Now they will try to christen their newer digs with a sixth championship -- thanks in part to a new quarterback, who found acceptance and understanding in South Florida.\n\"We really banded together and showed that we believe in connection; that we just don't fake it,\" Beck said. \"This team is really a family. If our team really wasn't like that, I don't know if this win happens tonight.\"\n            ",

Back-to-back losses in Weeks 16-17 landed them with a wild card, which of course means their road to the Super Bowl is a bit tougher. Then, this is a revenge game for the Rams, as they were upset by the Panthers in Carolina in Week 13. ... Despite the playoff berth, it's not like the Panthers are riding high. They fell to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the regular-season finale, and needed the Atlanta Falcons to save them. I would love to see the forever-doubted Bryce Young play the role of spoiler and rookie phenom Tetairoa McMillan dice up this Rams secondary, but I don't think it's in the cards this week.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Jordan Dajani on why he has L.A. covering the massive spread, 31-20.

I'm not saying that Williams can't do it, but I am saying that almost every quarterback making his first career playoff start tends to struggle and Williams is making his first career playoff start. Last year, Bo Nix and Sam Darnold were both making their first career playoff starts in the wild card round and both quarterbacks got blown out.

That's the matchup that will decide the game. The 49ers defense has struggled all year, while the Eagles offense has as well. Something has to give. I think the Eagles offense will get it going some here against the 49ers defense. Look for a big game from Saquon Barkley. On the other side, I look for the Eagles to limit Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense. The Eagles get it going some on offense and advance to the next round.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he has Philly winning and covering over the Niners.

They should get Trent Williams and possibly Ricky Pearsall back for this game, which should help them move the ball against Philly's defense better than they did against Seattle. HOWEVER. San Francisco is still incredibly banged up on both sides of the ball, but particularly on defense. I know the Eagles are perhaps the most untrustworthy offense in the league, but I like them to be able to get something going against this San Francisco unit that has allowed offenses to move the ball with consistency even before losing Tatum Bethune (in addition to Fred Warner, Nick Bosa and more) for the season. I don't feel fully comfortable backing a team that can look so listless, so often, but that's why I'm picking the Eagles to win and not cover.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Jared Dubin on how he sees this playoff matchup between Philly and San Francisco unfolding.

The Chargers QB is 0-2 in his playoff career, and they've been some pretty damming defeats. The first saw Herbert and the Chargers blowing a 27-0 lead to the Jaguars during the 2022 playoffs.

White. The SportsLine expert has been on a 37-20-1 roll (+1455) over his last 58 picks involving the Steelers. Now, he's revealed his best-bet for this Monday night showdown against Houston. We can tell you he's leaning Over the 39.5 total, but to see his official pick for this game, you'll need to go to SportsLine.Steelers +3: \"The Texans have one of the best defenses in the league and that can be a problem for a Steelers offense that is just OK. Aaron Rodgers does have a lot of playoff experience, which matters. He also gets back DK Metcalf in this one, which is big. The Steelers offensive line has also been good as of late. The Texans offense has been better during a nine-game winning streak, but this will come down to Houston's offensive line against the Steelers' front. That's a problem. Look for the Steelers to force some mistakes by C.J. Stroud as Pittsburgh advances behind its defensive front in a playoff upset.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he has Pittsburgh upsetting Houston as a home underdog.

The Hurricanes will face the winner of No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon on Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami for college football's ultimate prize.The Hurricanes went on a 15-play, 75-yard drive that lasted 2:55 and resulted in a 3-yard touchdown run by quarterback Carson Beck. Ole Miss had one final chance to pull off an upset on the last play of the game, but the pass in the end zone was incomplete.Despite being guaranteed to be the worst seed in the title game, Miami will actually be playing at its own stadium for the right to win its first national title since 2001. That's because Hard Rock Stadium was chosen as the site for the CFP title game back in 2022. The city of Miami will host the title game for the second time this decade and the first time since hosting Alabama's win over Ohio State back in 2021.\nAlthough it's rare for a college or professional team to play for a title at their home stadium, it's not unheard of. During the 2020 season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs to win their second Super Bowl title. The Buccaneers won the Super Bowl inside Raymond James Stadium, although attendance was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The following year, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals at SoFi Stadium to win their second Super Bowl title in franchise history. Before that, no team in NFL history had played for the Super Bowl title inside its home stadium.\nNext year's CFP title game will take place in Las Vegas. UNLV plays its home games at Allegiant Stadium in Sin City, which would be the next opportunity for a college football team to accomplish the same feat as Miami. Due to the circumstances -- and the fact that Miami plays its home games inside an NFL stadium -- it might be quite some time before a college football team matches this feat.\n            \n    ",

Ole Miss has also scored 30-plus in eight straight overall, which is the longest active streak in FBS, as the team is actually averaging more points since Lane Kiffin's departure. Quarterback Trinidad Chambliss won a DII national title last year at Ferris State, and he's thrived in the postseason. Chambliss is 6-0 in his NCAA playoffs career, with a staggering 23 total touchdowns compared to just one turnover. He leads an offense which Miami could have problems keeping up with as the Hurricanes' two lowest offensive outputs of the season, in terms of total yards gained, have come in their last two games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Miami can cover The Canes have won their last four games versus SEC teams, and they are 5-0 ATS this season versus ranked opponents. Miami's defense is as good as anyone's, ranking fourth in the nation in points allowed per game (13.1). It has allowed seven total touchdowns over its last six games, which were all wins, and the team also has three times as many takeaways (12) as giveaways (four) during this stretch. The Canes have also racked up 12 sacks in this CFP, which is already the second-most all-time in a single College Football Playoff. Additionally, Miami can keep Ole Miss' explosive offense on the sideline by attacking the Rebels' defense on the ground and eating up the clock. Just two SEC teams allow more yards per rush (4.2) than Ole Miss, which has allowed an average of 167 rushing yards over its last three games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Ole Miss picksFornelli has analyzied Ole Miss vs. Miami and is leaning Under on the total.

    "body": "\n        No. 6 Ole Miss lost a heartbreaker against No. 10 Miami 31-27 in the Fiesta Bowl, costing the Rebels a shot at the program's first-ever national title game appearance. But while the Hurricanes are heading to the national title game, contact on the final Hail Mary attempt will leave many fans wondering what could have been. Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss put his cape on in perhaps his final appearance with the Rebels, connecting for consecutive passes of 23 and 17 yards to reach the Miami 35-yard line. Both teams called a timeout with six seconds remaining, knowing that the next play would likely be the final one in Phoenix. Chambliss dropped back, backpedaling to buy time and then targeted receiver De'Zhaun Stribling in the corner of the end zone. Stribling got a hand on the ball, but was unable to reel it in through multiple defenders. He quickly put his hands in the air in protest. \nAs Stribling made his way down the field, Miami cornerback Ethan O'Connor seemed to hold onto his pads. Stribling's jersey moved due to O'Connor's pull, and Stribling pushed back against O'Connor's face. O'Connor also appeared to pull down as the ball reached the end zone. \nOle Miss players after the play looked to the officials with confusion, expecting a flag, but none came. \nESPN rules analyst Bill LeMonnier was asked about the play on the broadcast. Despite the fighting and pulling, he agreed with the decision to not throw a flag and let the game end. \"When we have mutual combat, we're going to leave that alone 99% of the time,\" LeMonnier said. \nOn the day, Miami was the more penalized team, committing 10 violations for 74 yards. Ole Miss was more disciplined, called for only four for 34 yards. During one key sequence, the Hurricanes committed a pass interference and a late hit in consecutive plays, pushing Ole Miss into the red zone. However, they only escaped with a field goal. It's also worth noting that the game was officiated by a neutral Big Ten crew. Miami quarterback Carson Beck led a legacy-defining drive in the waning seconds of regulation, running for a touchdown with only 18 seconds remaining. The Hurricanes are now set to play in their first national championship game since 2002. The title game is taking place at Hard Rock Stadium, the same venue where the Hurricanes play their home games. For Ole Miss, much of the coaching staff is set to leave for LSU after former coach Lane Kiffin left before the College Football Playoff. Pete Golding was promoted to head coach before the postseason, and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. remained to call plays. With this result, Weis's tenure in Oxford is over. \n            ",

Just so fun.\"\n\nKim said she won't know the extent of the injury or a timetable for her potential return to the slopes until she has an MRI on Friday. She's hopeful it won't prevent her from competing in the upcoming Olympics, which begin on Feb. 6 in Italy, and noted she has range of motion and isn't in too much pain. \nKim is an eight-time X Games gold medalist in superpipe to go along with her two Olympic gold medals, and figures to be among the favorites again in Milano Cortina. However, after pulling out of the final tune-up event with an undisclosed injury at the U.S. Grand Prix in December, her dislocated shoulder suffered in Switzerland figures to at minimum cause her an unwanted delay in preparations for the Games. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For the fourth time in this College Football Playoff, a rematch is on deck. No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon will meet again Friday night at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta. The previous three rematch results suggests this sequel may favor the Ducks -- teams that won the regular-season meeting are 1-2 in this CFP -- a reality Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti readily acknowledged.\"Hard to beat a team twice, so edge to Oregon there,\" Cignetti said last Friday.Indiana, still unbeaten, handed Oregon its only loss of the season back on Oct. 11 in Eugene, overcoming a fourth-quarter pick-6 thrown by quarterback Fernando Mendoza to pull away for a 30-20 win. CFP predictions: Why Indiana will win it all | Why Oregon will win a national title Friday's national semifinal marks uncharted territory for Indiana, a program still seeking its first recognized national championship in football. Oregon, meanwhile, is making its second national semifinal appearance of the CFP era, still chasing a title of its own after coming up short in the championship games following the 2010 and 2014 seasons.\nWhere to watch Indiana vs. Oregon liveDate: Friday, Jan. 9 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Indiana vs. Oregon: Players to watch in Peach Bowl\n    \n                                        \n    Fernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana: The Heisman Trophy winner had more touchdown passes (3) than incompletions (2) in the Hoosiers Rose Bowl win against Alabama. Mendoza already set the single-season program record for most touchdown passes (36) and is currently third in single-season passing yards (3,172).Rolijah Hardy, LB, Indiana: The Hoosiers' individual tackle leader this season with 93 total stops, Hardy was key in the win against Oregon during the regular season. He had 13 tackles, including two for loss with a sack. Hardy earned second-team All-Big Ten honors this season.\nD'Angelo Ponds, CB, Indiana: Ponds earned Defensive Player of the Game at the Rose Bowl, adding to his list of honors that includes being named second-team All-America by CBS Sports. He has yet to allow a touchdown reception in coverage and just 27 catches on 50 targets, according to Pro Football Focus.\n    \n                                        \n    Dante Moore, QB, Oregon: Moore had an overall shaky performance in the Orange Bowl win despite completing 78.8% of his passes. Still, he has blossomed into one of the nation's premier quarterbacks and could be a top-five pick in the 2026 NFL Draft if he opts to forgo his final year of eligibility. The Ducks' signal-caller ranks third nationally in completion percentage (72.9%), seventh in passer rating (166.73), eighth in passing touchdowns (28) and 14th in yards per attempt (8.8), showcasing his precision.Jordon Davison, RB, Oregon: Oregon deploys a balanced, three-man rotation in the backfield, but Davison has emerged as its most dangerous finisher. Despite sharing carries with Noah Whittington and Dierre Hill Jr., the true freshman has piled up 667 yards on 113 rushes and found the end zone 15 times on the ground -- a total that ranks among the national leaders.\nBrandon Finney Jr., DB, Oregon: The true freshman played a big role in the Ducks' shutout win in the Orange Bowl, snagging two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Finney became just the second player in CFP history with three takeaways in a game.Indiana vs. Oregon prediction, pick\nCurt Cignetti isn't wrong -- beating a team twice in one season is no small task. Still, there's no reason to doubt the Hoosiers. Oregon's shutout win in the CFP quarterfinal over Texas Tech looked impressive on paper, but the Ducks' offense struggled to find rhythm against a respectable Tech defense. This Indiana defense is arguably better overall. The Hoosiers remain the only team to beat Oregon at home in the last 23 games, and getting them on a neutral field, plus factoring in another long trip to Atlanta after South Florida, gives the Hoosiers a real edge. Prediction: Indiana -4.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred was in studio for a segment on WFAN in New York Thursday afternoon and among the topics broached was expansion and, along with it, realignment. It's been a hot button topic the last few years, as it's been a long time since MLB expanded and the league is currently thriving. While the league is currently balanced with two leagues of 15 teams and six divisions of five, each league having an odd number of teams feels a bit off. And, again, the league hasn't expanded since the Diamondbacks and Devil Rays joined the fray in 1998. The commissioner has long said he wants two expansion teams selected before his term expires in January 2029.\"Thirty-two would be good for us,\" he said, also noting there are a lot of cities that want a Major League Baseball team. \"When people want your product, you oughta try to find a way to sell it to them.\"Mathematically, 32 teams would fit more snugly into leagues than 30, given that you could have 16 teams in each league and eight divisions of four. \n\"It does a ton for us from a format perspective,\" the commissioner said. \"You would realign along geographic lines, which could alleviate a ton of the travel burden that's on players.\" It's a good point. Keep in mind that MLB players travel so much more than players in any other sport, given the 162-game schedule, even with it divided up into 2-4 game series throughout the season. Manfred also discussed what a problem the first round of playoff games can be, logistically, if featuring a team from each coast, making the scheduling either too late for people in the east or too early for people in the west -- and sometimes both. Other leagues, like the NBA, are more cleanly split geographically, allowing the Knicks to play in eastern time and the Thunder in western, for example. \nThe big takeaway there is that Manfred likes the idea of moving away from the American and National Leagues and instead toward East and West leagues. However, he did say he would want to keep the two-team cities \"separate.\" That is to say that the Cubs and White Sox, Mets and Yankees and Dodgers and Angels, respectively, would remain in different divisions.  Upon first glance, that might seem like a tough needle to thread, but not impossible.Even if the Mets and Yankees, for example, were both in an Eastern League, you could group the Yankees with the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Pirates while the Mets could go with the Phillies, Orioles and Nationals. It could work.Regardless, there's a CBA next offseason that needs to be completed and Manfred has also said in previous years that he won't deal with expansion until the stadium situations are resolved for the A's and Rays. \nStill, it's a fun offseason topic of discussion.\n            ",

Detroit is a file-and-trial team, meaning they will not negotiate on a one-year deal before the hearing. That means the two sides are likely headed for a possibly contentious arbitration hearing that could impact extension talks. Skubal's camp filed for a $32 million salary for 2026 while the Tigers filed at $19 million, a $13 million gap that represents the largest difference in arbitration history, according to ESPN. The record for a pitcher in arbitration is $19.75 million, but that was in 2015 (David Price). Skubal's filing of $32 million would beat Juan Soto's record ($31 million) in arbitration.By way of reminder, players with 3-6 years of MLB service time are eligible for salary arbitration. As well, players in the top 22% of service time between 2-3 years are also eligible. Those latter players are called Super Twos and go through arbitration four times rather than the usual three before being in line for free agency. Other big names eligible for arbitration this time around who reached settlements include Randy Arozarena of the Mariners, Hunter Brown of the Astros, Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman of the Orioles, and Jazz Chisholm Jr. of the Yankees, among others. Eighteen players, including the aforementioned Skubal, William Contreras of the Brewers, Joe Ryan of the Twins, and Isaac Paredes of the Astros, were unable to reach a settlement.\nAs for how the arbitration deadline works, players file the salary they believe they should be paid in 2026 and teams file the salary they believe the players should be paid for the upcoming season. If the two sides are unable to agree on a figure, they will go to an arbitration hearing where each side will state their case, and a three-person panel will pick either the salary the player filed or the salary the team filed. There's no splitting the difference between the two figures or picking one out of thin air. As such, the system is designed to promote negotiation, and that's typically what happens before a trial is held. Indeed, the vast majority of arbitration-eligible players sign one-year contracts for the coming season prior to the filing deadline. Only a handful actually file salary figures and even fewer go to a hearing. Neither side wants to go to a hearing because the process necessarily entails, on the team side, emphasizing a player's flaws and shortcomings in the name of winning. That can lead to acrimony and a frayed relationship between team and player. Generally speaking, arbitration salaries are based on comparable players at the same service time level. A player with three years of service time who outperformed a player with six years of service time could have a lower 2025 salary because of, well, service time. Service time matters in arbitration. It's not purely about performance. That means the biggest arb-eligible salaries belong to those players who are in the final year of arbitration. Here are the record arbitration salaries heading into this year's deadline: \nJuan Soto, 2024 Yankees: $31 millionShohei Ohtani, 2023 Angels: $30 millionVladimir Guerrero Jr., 2025 Blue Jays: 28.5 millionMookie Betts, 2020 Dodgers: $27 millionNolan Arenado, 2019 Rockies: $26 millionHere now are some of the notable signings from Thursday's arbitration salary filing deadline.Oneil Cruz, Pirates, $3.3 million (FanSided)Anthony Volpe, Yankees, $3.475 million (YES)Ernie Clement, Blue Jays, $4.6 million (FanSided)CJ Abrams, Nationals, $5.2 million (FanSided)Riley Greene, Tigers, $5 million (Detroit Free Press)Gavin Lux, Reds, $5.525 million (New York Post)Shea Langeliers, A's, $5.25 million (FanSided)MacKenzie Gore, Nationals, $5.6 million (FanSided)Hunter Brown, Astros, $5.71 million (MLB.com)Brendan Donovan, Cardinals, $5.8 million (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)Bryson Stott, Phillies, $5.9 million (FanSided)George Kirby, Mariners, $6.55 million (FanSided)Jesús Sánchez, Astros, $6.8 million (MLB.com)Adley Rutschman, Orioles, $7.25 million (FanSided)Jhoan Duran, Phillies, $7.5 million (The Athletic)Steven Kwan, Guardians, $7.725 million (FanSided)David Peterson, Mets, $8.1 million (FanSided)Gunnar Henderson, Orioles, $8.5 million (Baltimore Banner)Jeremy Peña, Astros, $9.475 million (MLB.com)Alec Bohm, Phillies, $10.2 million (The Athletic)Jazz Chisholm Jr., Yankees, $10.2 million (YES)Daulton Varsho, Blue Jays, $10.75 million (New York Post)Jesus Luzardo, Phillies, $11 million (Philadelphia Inquirer)Taylor Ward, Orioles, $12.175 million (FanSided)Randy Arozarena, Mariners, $15.65 million (FanSided)Failed to agree to dealTarik Skubal, Tigers; player filed at $32 million, team filed at $19 million (MLB.com)Eric Lauer, Blue Jays; player filed at $5.75 million, team filed at $4.4 million (Sportsnet)William Contreras, Brewers; player filed at $9.9 million, team filed at $8.55 million (MLB.com)Joe Ryan, Twins; player filed at $6.35 million, team filed at $5.85 million (MLB.com)Isaac Paredes, Astros; player filed at $9.95 million, team filed at $8.75 million (MLB.com)Kris Bubic, Royals; player filed at $6.15 million, team filed at $5.15 million (MLB.com)Vinnie Pasqantino, Royals; player filed at $4.5 million, team filed at $4 million (MLB.com)Tyler Stephenson, Reds; player filed at $6.8 million, team filed at $6.55 million (MLB.com)Graham Ashcraft, Reds; player filed at $1.75 million, team filed at $1.25 million (MLB.com)Keegan Akin, Orioles; player filed at $3.375 million, team filed at $2.975 million (MLB.com)Kyle Bradish, Orioles; player filed at $3.55 million, team filed at $2.875 million (MLB.com)Cade Cavalli, Nationals; player filed at $900,000, team filed at $825,000 (MLB.com)Reid Detmers, Angels; player filed at $2.925 million, team filed at $2.625 million (MLB.com)Yainer Diaz, Astros; player filed at $4.5 million, team filed at $3 million (MLB.com)Bryce Miller, Mariners; player filed at $2.625 million, team filed at $2.25 million (MLB.com)Edwin Uceta, Rays; player filed at $1.525 million, team filed at $1.2 million (MLB.com)Dylan Lee, Braves; player filed at $2.2 million, team filed at $2 million (MLB.com)Calvin Faucher, Marlins; player filed at $2.05 million, team filed at $1.8 million (MLB.com)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        If you asked PGA Tour players to define their biggest weaknesses, you would wind up getting myriad different answers: some based on feel, some based on numbers, some based on imagination and some based on what they have accomplished in the past and the heights to which they have previously soared.Weakness is all relative, of course. A historically good driver of the golf ball who experienced a down season in that area may still have a long-term perspective on his skill set. The same holds up and down the bag. On the other end of the spectrum, players may view certain parts of the game as a lost cause, almost with hopes of occasionally strong weeks complementing the cornerstones of their game.Let's take a look at where players may have dipped in 2025 -- both from a short-term standpoint and from a \"he really needs to fix this\" point of view. Were they just down years and not the beginnings (or continuations) of downward trends?Viktor Hovland's drivingThe best iron season of Hovland's career -- he finished second to Scottie Scheffler in terms of strokes gained approach in 2025 -- was met with the worst driving season of his career. Oh, golf, such a fickle game. The former FedEx Cup champion lamented throughout the season that the big stick was in an uncomfortable spot, and it is not a stretch to say it was one of the reasons why he did not win the U.S. Open, where he finished solo third.\n\"Yeah, a little bitter about my driver,\" Hovland said at Oakmont. \"Just can't seem to figure it out. It's like a lingering problem all this year, so it's kind of pissing me off.\"But where exactly did things go wrong with Hovland off the tee?Hovland's driving statisticsCategoryValueRankStrokes gained: Off the tee0.09983rdDriving distance303.387thDriving accuracy63.13%58thLeft rough tendency9.09%4thRight rough tendency14.39%74thDistance from edge of fairway25' 6\"56thBall speed173.95101stClub head speed115.64107thThe biggest takeaway from above? Hovland moved in the wrong direction in terms of speed. In his memorable 2023 season, the Norwegian had an additional 4 mph at his disposal in terms of average ball speed and 3 mph in club head speed. Coincidentally, the faster he swung, the more accurate his ball flew within a tighter window.Some of this regression could be due to injury -- Hovland had to withdraw from Sunday singles at the Ryder Cup due to a nagging neck injury that popped up at the Travelers Championship -- or less speed training in general. No matter the cause, the effect handcuffed him at various points in the year.Bryson DeChambeau's iron playDeChambeau has never been the best iron player in the world, but he has always been capable of piecing together high-end performances. In 2025, he never really did that outside of a LIV Golf event in Korea, which doubled as his only victory of the season.On the major stage, the two-time U.S. Open champion was held back by this area of his game. It was a significant reason why he was unable to hold onto his lead Sunday at the Masters after grabbing it two holes into the final round, and it is why he fell off the pace Saturday at the PGA Championship.It just was not good enough, and at those venues, it was exposed.DeChambeau attempted to rectify the situation -- he replaced his 3D-printed Avoda blades that made noise at the 2024 Masters with a new set from LA Golf ahead of the U.S. Open and played a different golf ball in hopes of producing less spin. The results weren't necessarily there in the second half of the summer, but the thinking is and with a full offseason of tinkering under his belt, DeChambeau will have something up his sleeve for 2026.Collin Morikawa's short gameMorikawa's obsession with hitting the fade is so deep that he asked Santa Claus for it on Christmas. Seriously. Who knows if he got it under his tree, but it won't matter if his short game does not take a step in the right direction. It's true that Morikawa's iron play is not as good as it was in 2020 and 2021 when he won two major championships, two other PGA Tour events and the DP World Tour Championship, but it is not that far off.He still ranked third on the PGA Tour in strokes gained approach this year behind only Scheffler and Hovland. That is a place where he can do damage, but if he wants to win big tournaments -- which he has not done since the 2023 Zozo Championship ... err ... Baycurrent Classic -- he needs more than just his iron play.To keep up with Scheffler, McIlroy and DeChambeau, Morikawa needs the entire arsenal. He lacks length and does not seem intent on chasing any, so his path to victory is slimmer, and it tightens even more with the state of his short game. Ceiling performances are still there when everything clicks, but the floor drops from underneath him when his fade isn't fading.In 2025, Morikawa experienced the worst total strokes gained season of his career in large part because it was his second-worst around-the-green campaign and his second-worst on them. This comes just one year after he put together his second-best total strokes gained season -- better than 2020 and 2021 -- thanks to his best season both on and around the green. So, why wasn't it his best, then? Because he had his worst approach year. But with his irons back in tow, that should no longer be a worry. Instead, the focus should be on how he can improve chipping, pitching and putting.Xander Schauffele's puttingSchauffele's driving numbers are a bit noisy from a statistical standpoint. His return from injury came at a point in the schedule that featured some of the most difficult driving courses on the PGA Tour, and oh yeah, he put a new driver in the bag as well.That's a lot of variables to juggle, but where Schauffele seriously fell short was another spot where the variables were at a minimum: on the putting surface. This past season marked the first time in his career that he bled strokes to his PGA Tour counterparts with the putter in hand. He ranked 139th overall, lost almost 0.20 strokes per round and even switched putters during the postseason for a hot second.Strokes gained: Putting by yearYearSG: PuttingRank2025-0.184139th20240.51012th20230.6675th20220.34332nd20210.48016th20200.36633rd20190.24446th20180.19666th20170.40227thMuch like how driving can set up a player, putting bleeds into the rest of one's games. If putting stalls, well, it is more difficult to score, more difficult to scramble, and players are less likely to get up-and-down from greenside bunkers. Schauffele is a prime example of this. In 2024 -- albeit in the best season of his career -- he ranked first on the PGA Tour in scrambling and 12th in strokes gained putting. This past year, again, he ranked 139th in putting and 136th in scrambling. His conversion rate dipped from 71% to 58%. His sand-save percentage dropped by about 5%, too. One-putt percentage by the same clip.These are all numbers about his saves, but scoring figures paint a similar picture. He averaged about two fewer birdies per tournament and played the par 3s and par 4s in an over-par fashion. This came after a season where he led the PGA Tour in par-3 scoring and played the par 4s under par. If you're doing that, you're winning major championships or two in the case of Schauffele.There is good news, however. Schauffele surged past the field in his lone start of the FedEx Cup Fall to pick up a win in Japan. Although the numbers from the tournament were tracked incorrectly, based on the all-important eye test, Schauffele passed with flying colors on the greens. The same rang true at Bethpage Black where he was a bright spot for the U.S. team. There are myriad reasons to be bullish on Schauffele heading into 2026. His driving continually got better, his iron play remained sharp, and he proved in a different sense that he is tough as nails. Perhaps most important of all? He is not going to putt this poorly again.\n            ",

That field is now down to four: No. 1 Indiana, No. 5 Oregon, No. 6 Ole Miss and No. 10 Miami.Miami stunned reigning national champion Ohio State on New Years eve in one of the biggest upsets of the season. The Hurricanes will face Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday with a berth in the national title game at stake. The Rebels advanced with a dramatic 39-34 win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.The other semifinal is a rematch of one of the regular season's most compelling games. Indiana went into Eugene earlier this year and upset Oregon to preserve its unbeaten season. After Indiana humbled Alabama in the Rose Bowl and Oregon dispatched Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl, the Hoosiers and Ducks will meet again in the Peach Bowl for a spot in the championship game.As the CFP continues, here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate the semifinal matchups Thursday and Friday.\nAll times EasternCollege Football Playoff semifinal TV scheduleFiesta Bowl -- (10) Miami vs. (6) Ole Miss -- Thursday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free):Thursday brings one of the most unlikely semifinal matchups in CFP history. The Hurricanes were the final at-large team selected for the field Miami's path to the semifinals began with a road upset of Texas A&M, followed by a win over reigning national champion Ohio State. Ole Miss followed a different route. The Rebels opened the playoff with a home win over Tulane before stunning Georgia. Their postseason run came amid significant turbulence, as former coach Lane Kiffin departed for LSU days before CFP Selection Sunday. Ole Miss responded by promoting defensive coordinator Pete Golding to head coach, a move that has quickly paid dividends. Thursday's game also features a compelling quarterback matchup between Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss and Miami's Carson Beck.\nPeach Bowl -- (5) Oregon vs. (1) Indiana -- Friday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): There is a chance this quarterback matchup could feature the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is already drawing significant buzz as a potential top pick, while Oregon signal caller Dante Moore could be the second quarterback selected if he declares. Indiana is coming off the biggest win in program history, and the stakes will be even higher this weekend. Oregon, meanwhile, sits one win away from playing for the first national championship in program history after being eliminated in the quarterfinals last year as the No. 1 overall seed. The Big Ten is guaranteed a spot in the national championship game for the third consecutive season after Michigan and Ohio State represented the league in back-to-back years.\n            \n    ",

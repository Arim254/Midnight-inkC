Blake Snell allowed only one Brewers baserunner, but the good news for Milwaukee is Snell won't be in the picture on Tuesday. The Brewers scored a run and had four players reach base in their only inning against the Dodgers' bullpen, so that confidence could carry over into Game 2. The Brewers are starting Freddy Peralta, who went 17-6 with a 2.70 ERA, the seventh-best in baseball. The Brewers had the best record in baseball at 97-65, including 52-29 at home, as the model doesn't expect them to drop back-to-back home games in the NLCS. The model projects Milwaukee to win in 58% of simulations, showcasing strong plus-money value for Monday. Back the Brewers at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Liberty (-10) vs. New Mexico State (-108)Liberty snapped a four-game losing streak with a 19-8 victory over UTEP on Wednesday, and four of those five games came on the road. The Flames opened the season with a 28-7 home victory over Maine after going 5-1 at home last season, so home-field advantage could be a significant factor in Liberty covering the number on Tuesday. Vaughn Blue rushed for 75 yards on 17 carries for 4.4 yards per rush and Liberty rushed for 165 yards as a team last week. Meanwhile, New Mexico State allows 173.8 rushing yards per game, which ranks 96th in the nation. The model projects Liberty to cover in 59% of simulations for this 7 p.m. ET start on CBS Sports Network. Back Liberty at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Western Kentucky (-10) vs. Florida International (-112)Western Kentucky (5-1) has won three straight games and is coming off its bye heading into this Conference USA matchup. The Hilltoppers defeated Delaware, 27-24, on the road on Oct. 3, and they return home on Tuesday. Western Kentucky is 3-0 at home, winning all three games by at least 15 points with an average victory of 27 points in those contests. Meanwhile, Florida International is 2-3 and coming off a 51-10 loss to UConn after falling to Delaware, 38-16.

    "body": "\nThe Milwaukee Brewers will turn to ace right-hander Freddy Peralta on Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers as they hope to avoid a two-game deficit the National League Championship Series. First pitch from American Family Field is set for 8:08 pm. ET. The defending World Series champions Dodgers won the series opener 2-1 on Monday behind Blake Snell's scoreless, one-hit performance in eight innings. Freddie Freeman's sixth-inning solo homer accounted for all the scoring until the Dodgers added a run in the ninth on a walk with the bases loaded.The veteran ace Peralta (1-1, 4.66 ERA postseason),who won 17 games during the regular season, will be opposed by Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto (1-1, 2.53). Peralta is 4-2 with a 3.27 ERA in eight career starts against the Dodgers. He won both his starts against them this season, allowing four runs in 11 innings.Peralta also faced the Dodgers once each as a reliever in the 2018 NLCS and in a 2020 NL wild-card series, throwing a combined four innings and yielding one run.\"I like our chances when he's out there,\" Brewers teammate Christian Yelich told the media Monday night. \"He's a great pitcher and gives a shot to win. So now, flush this one and get ready for tomorrow.\"In his only performance against the Brewers this season, Yamamoto lasted just two-thirds of an inning on July 7 in Milwaukee. He allowed five runs on four hits and two walks in a 9-1 loss.Los Angeles is around a -120 favorite (risk $120 to win $100), while Milwaukee is priced at +100 in the latest sportsbook MLB odds for Dodgers vs. Brewers in Game 2 of the NLCS. In addition to the monster MLB contest, we'll feature an NHL matchup between the Minnesota Wild and Dallas Stars and also look ahead to the Thursday night NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals.

White) Following a wild finish to Week 6 of the NFL season in which both underdogs won outright in the Monday Night Football doubleheader, we move on to Week 7 with an AFC North rivalry renewing Thursday night between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals. Kickoff is set for Behind 41-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the Steelers (4-1) have been efficient on offense, and their defense is starting to round into shape with the return of several key players from injury. The Bengals (2-4) won their first two games before quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a season-ending injury, sending them into a tailspin. Backup quarterback Jake Browning was ineffective in two starts, and a defense that is giving ul 30.5 points per game (No. 30 in the NFL) isn't helping matters. In a desperate move to try and salvage their season, they acquired well-traveled Joe Flacco to take the reins under center. Flacco went 29-of-45 for 219 yards and two touchdowns while peppering receivers Ja'Maar Chase and Tee Higgins with 20 total targets. Still, the Bengals fell 27-18 to the Packers for their fourth consecutive defeat while the Steelers clipped the Browns 23-9 for their third straight win.SportsLine top NFL expert R.J. White (+2141 on NFL picks this season) expects the trend of underdogs covering in primetime games to continue Thursday. He says he believes Pittsburgh shouldn't be laying nearly a touchdown on the road in a divisional rivalry despite Cincinnati's recent struggles, and he's taking the points with the home underdog. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The return of the AP Top 25 is a kind reminder that basketball season is here. Clearly, the top objective for college basketball scribes throughout the country is to outperform the football projections that look awfully dire past the midway point of the season.On paper, the initial AP Top 25 is tame. There were not any egregious additions or omissions.Let's dive into the projected starting lineups and the biggest strengths and weaknesses for each club.\n        \n            \n                AP Top 25 poll reactions: North Carolina overrated, Kansas underrated in preseason college basketball rankings\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. PurdueProjected starting lineupG Braden SmithG CJ CoxG Fletcher LoyerF Trey Kaufman-RennC Oscar CluffTop reserves: C Daniel Jacobsen, G Omer Mayer, G Gicarri Harris, F Liam Murphy, G Antione West Jr.\nBiggest strengths: Purdue's personnel is different. Smith is the best point guard in America, and Kaufman-Renn is a problem in the paint. A Smith pocket pass to Kaufman-Renn was one of the most unguardable actions in the sport. Smith fed Kaufman-Renn for a whopping 236 points last year, per CBB Analytics, and it should be a go-to feature of a Purdue offense that could be the best in America in 2025-26. Purdue always has loads of shooting, and this year is no different with Loyer, Cox, Mayer, Murphy and Harris. A fresh bill of health for 7-foot-4 center Jacobsen and the addition of South Dakota State transfer Cluff should buff up the Boilermakers' interior defense and rebounding, which were two major stumbling blocks a year ago.Potential weaknesses: This roster is not abounding with tip-top athleticism, and that could be exacerbated by the departures of high-flying wings, namely Myles Colvin (to Wake Forest) and Camden Heide (to Texas). Functionally, it will show up the most on defense. Can Purdue find someone to handle those tough assignments against big wings? Is the combination of Cluff and Kaufman-Renn mobile enough defensively? Can Purdue's defense be disruptive? Or is this just a defense forced to play a barrage of drop coverage and hope to win the shot-quality game?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. HoustonProjected starting lineupG Milos UzanG Emanuel SharpG Isiah HarwellF Chris Cenac Jr.F Joseph TuglerTop reserves: G Kingston Flemings, F Kalifa Sakho, G Mercy Miller, G Ramon Walker, G Chase McCarty, F Jacob McFarland\nBiggest strengths: Houston's defense should not miss a beat thanks to the return of Uzan (a twitchy point of attack defender), Sharp (a burly, physical wing defender) and Tugler (a menace both at the rim and blitzing ball screens). That's three plus defenders at three levels of the floor. Add in five-star freshman like Harwell plus a program staple in Walker, and Houston has four enormous guards to sic against any opposing backcourt. Oh, and Houston has an influx of NBA talent with Harwell, Cenac and Flemings headlining the program's best recruiting haul of the modern era. A talent-maximizing coach like Kelvin Sampson, armed with next-level prospects, is a scary proposition for the Kings of the Big 12.Potential weaknesses: I'm curious how this halfcourt offense coalesces with some young guys thrust into big roles. When Houston needed a bucket, grizzled veterans like LJ Cryer or J'Wan Roberts often earned the call. Houston will miss Roberts' mid-post backdowns and Cryer's dynamic shot-making. Can Cenac replace some of Roberts' isolation brilliance? Harwell is not quite a burner like Cryer, so it'll be up to Sharp and Uzan to expand their offensive roles to new heights.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. FloridaProjected starting lineupG Xaivian LeeG Boogie FlandF Thomas HaughF Alex CondonF Rueben ChinyeluTop reserves: G CJ Ingram, C Micah Handlogten, G Urban Klavzar, G AJ Brown, G Isaiah BrownBiggest strengths: Todd Golden may have the best frontcourt in America with Haugh, Condon, Chinyelu and Handlogten in the fold. That fearsome foursome should help Florida dominate the glass, control the paint and kickstart a smashmouth transition attack. It keeps the floor incredibly high for the Gators, even though the brilliant Walter Clayton Jr. is off to the NBA. The Gators should be able to replace Clayton's production in the aggregate. Haugh will earn more burn and is a future NBA player. Condon will get a little better in Year 3. Fland, an Arkansas transfer, is going to be terrific in this guard-friendly scheme, and Florida is prepared to trot out some double-barreled, two-point guard looks with Lee next to Fland. Both are tried-and-true shot creators who posted low turnover rates last year. That's essential for the math to tilt in Florida's favor. Potential weaknesses: Haugh starting at the 3 should be fine because his handle is so nifty, but Florida still needs a third guard to emerge. Golden has multiple bites at the apple with Ingram, Klavzar and the Brown brothers (AJ and Isaiah), but the Gators won the National Championship because they had multiple secondary guards (Alijah Martin, Denzel Aberdeen and Will Richard) who were huge assets on both ends of the floor. Does this roster have that behind Fland? We're about to find out.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. UConnProjected starting lineupG Silas Demary Jr.G Solo BallG Braylon MullinsF Alex KarabanC Tarris Reed Jr.Top reserves: F Jaylin Stewart, G Malachi Smith, F Eric Reibe, G/F Jayden Ross, G Jacob FurphyBiggest strengths: A scheme like this with shooters of UConn's ilk is utopia. The threat of the 3-ball from Demary, Ball, Mullins and Karaban (who could all shoot over 37% from downtown on high volume) should fuel a top-five offense, especially paired with Reed, who is a beast in the paint. Dan Hurley can go big or small at a moment's notice, and that optionality is everything in the chase for a championship.UConn's point guard play was dire for long stretches last year, but portal imports like Demary and Smith should transform it from a weakness to a strength. Purdue enters 2025-26 as the favorite to be the No. 1 offense in the country, but UConn is one of the few that could realistically vault the Boilermakers.\nPotential weaknesses: It's all about the defense if UConn wants to achieve its lofty goals. Can Reed protect the rim and anchor this defense without fouling every other possession? Can Ball improve as a point of attack defender? What are UConn's counters if it can't protect the rim when Reed isn't on the floor?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. St. John'sProjected starting lineupG Ian JacksonG Oziyah SellersG Joson SanonF Bryce HopkinsF Zuby EjioforTop reserves: F Dillon Mitchell, G Dylan Darling, F Ruben Prey, G Kelvin OdihBiggest strengths: The relentless energy and physicality from the Hopkins-Ejiofor frontcourt pairing makes St. John's enticing. Those two forwards are big, strong and nasty. St. John's can also throw Mitchell into the fray, and he's one of the elite athletes in all of college basketball. St. John's isn't just athletic and strong, it's also got real-deal speed. Hopkins and Ejiofor are glass-cleaners, and that should allow the jet-quick Jackson to just obliterate defenders in transition. \nThe top-four guards (Jackson, Sellers, Sanon and Darling) all shot over 35% on more than 4.0 attempts per game last season, and you know St. John's is going to be an excellent offensive rebounding team. That's a splendid combination for this offense to take a major step in the right direction, especially after last year when St. John's rated outside the top-200 nationally in offensive efficiency in the halfcourt, per Synergy.Potential weaknesses: For all the consternation about St. John's point guard play (it'll be fine), it's really the other end that matters way more to me. Rick Pitino has his work cut out for him to mold this new-look group into the desperate group of defensive hyenas that willed the 2024-25 Johnnies to a Big East championship. RJ Luis, Deivon Smith, Aaron Scott and Kadary Richmond were excellent individual defenders. Jackson and Sanon, specifically, both struggled on defense last year. St. John's has two impeccable interior defenders in Mitchell and Ejiofor, but they're going to be asked to douse a ton of fires if the point of attack defense slips.If Pitino builds another top-five defense out of this personnel, just give him National Coach of the Year right now.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. DukeProjected starting lineupG Caleb FosterG Isaiah EvansG/F Dame SarrF Cameron BoozerF Patrick Ngongba IITop reserves: G Cayden Boozer, F Maliq Brown, F Nikolas Khamenia, G Darren Harris, F Sebastian WilkinsBiggest strengths: Jon Scheyer has a little bit of everything in this frontcourt. Cameron Boozer is a future top-three pick, Ngongba is a serious candidate for a sophomore surge and Brown is one of the special defensive forwards in the sport. Duke's offense has so many buttons it can press because all three of its bigs have proven they can decipher defenses at a high level. Potential weaknesses: Duke has built one of the biggest rosters with no one shorter than 6-5 in the rotation, but there are still defensive questions. Duke was good, not great, at protecting the rim whenever Khaman Maluach was off the floor. Without Maluach and Cooper Flagg, can this team be an elite shot-blocking team? Also, Duke's go-to closing lineup last year had no bad defenders. Can Evans level up to make sure that Duke's weak link isn't a hot spot?\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. MichiganProjected starting lineupG Elliot CadeauG Roddy Gayle Jr.G Nimari BurnettF Yaxel LendeborgC Aday MaraTop reserves: F Morez Johnson Jr., G Trey McKenney, F Will Tschetter, G LJ Cason, G Winters GradyBiggest strengths: Michigan has everything it needs to build a dominant defense. Mara and Johnson provide 40 minutes of rim protection. Lendeborg is a Swiss Army Knife defensively. Burnett and Gayle are big, strong, veteran guards who bring it defensively. Cadeau can be an unscreenable pest when he wants to be. Michigan's struggles to defensive rebound were well-documented last year and a huge point of emphasis for Dusty May's staff. If this group struggles to rebound, May will pop a gasket. There's no excuse for Michigan not to be one of the best rebounding teams in the country.Potential weaknesses: There were a ton of notable struggling offenses last year that shared a similar roster-construction blueprint. Mixing a low-volume shooter at point guard with a non-shooting center created too many issues. May has to work around that with Cadeau and the Johnson/Mara platoon this year. There's enough pathways for Michigan to avoid too many hiccups (like transition, offensive rebounding and a sharp scheme), but the historical trends aren't pretty.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. BYUProjected starting lineupG Rob WrightG Kennard DavisG Richie SaundersG/F AJ DybantsaF Keba KeitaTop reserves: G Dawson Baker, F Dominique Diomande, F Mihailo Boskovic, F Xavion Staton, F Tyler MrusBiggest strengths: BYU's offense can press so many different buttons. The pick-and-roll game with Wright should be electric. Richie Saunders' off-ball cutting makes him a hard cover. Dybantsa's barrage of free throws and transition adds a new layer. There's spot-up options galore to drill 3-pointers. Kevin Young's offensive personnel is so much more athletic this year.Potential weaknesses: Top-100 teams averaged 116.0 points per 100 possessions against BYU when Keita was not on the floor. BYU has to find defensive answers when the big fella needs a blow or gets in foul trouble. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. KentuckyProjected starting lineupG Jaland LoweG Otega OwehG Denzel AberdeenF Mo DioubateF Brandon GarrisonTop reserves: C Jayden Quaintance (if healthy), G Jasper Johnson, F Kam Williams, G Collin Chandler, F Malachi MorenoBiggest strengths: Kentucky has way more options to go create a bucket out of nothing.  Mark Pope's system should weaponize dribble-drive slashers like Lowe, Oweh, Aberdeen and Dioubate. Once the ball gets popping, Kentucky can be a brutal team to defend with this level of athlete in a system this intricate.Potential weaknesses: Can Pope find a big man who can make reads? Garrison is the adult in the room, but his decision-making left a lot to be desired last year. Freshman big man Moreno has impressed and could garner more minutes if he can decipher defenses quickly. How much has Quaintance been able to pick up in the film room while being sidelined with a knee injury? That's the biggest concern for this offense right now.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Texas TechProjected starting lineupG Christian AndersonG Tyeree BryanF LeJuan WattsF JT ToppinC Luke BamgboyeTop reserves: G Donovan Atwell, F Josiah Moseley, G Jaylen PettyBiggest strengths: Texas Tech's offensive pieces fit nearly flawlessly together. Toppin is the fulcrum, and the pick-and-roll game with Anderson should hum with snipers like Bryan or Atwell spacing the floor. Watts is slated to adopt the Darrion Williams role as a bootyball threat who can create advantages in backdowns. Texas Tech can even get some vertical spacing with Bamgboye or some instant offense from freshman guard Petty. Elijah Hawkins' pocket passes will be missed, but Texas Tech is an exceptionally built team with a chance to hum offensively.Potential weaknesses: Who is the defensive stopper on the perimeter? Texas Tech's best defense may be an offense that forces you to take it out of the net repeatedly, but someone needs to become that go-to plus defender who can turn the water off. Watts' defensive chops are underrated, so maybe he becomes that guy, but none of these Texas Tech guards have established themselves as lockdown defenders yet.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    11. LouisvilleProjected starting lineupG Mikel Brown Jr.G Ryan ConwellG Isaac McKneelyF J'Vonne HadleyF Sananda FruTop reserves: G Adrian Wooley, F Kasean Pryor, C Aly Khalifa, F Khani Rooths, F Vangelis Zougris, G Kobe RodgersBiggest strengths: Shooting, shooting, shooting. Very few teams can offset the snipers Louisville has at its disposal. Conwell was one of the best five shooters in the Big East. McKneely was one of the best five shooters in the ACC. Brown Jr. is one of the top shooters in the freshman class. They're all on the same team. Pat Kelsey could have multiple guys crack 100 3-pointers next year, which is outrageous.Potential weaknesses: Louisville's interior defense does not project to be a real strength when Fru is not on the floor. There's a real chance it's a layup line for Louisville opponents when Khalifa is on the floor at the 5-spot.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    12. UCLAProjected starting lineupG Donovan DentG Skyy ClarkF Eric Dailey Jr.F Tyler BilodeauF Xavier BookerTop reserves: G Trent Perry, F Steven Jamerson II, F Brandon WilliamsBiggest strengths: UCLA's best four players are so steady. Dent is one of the top floor generals. Clark has become an outstanding two-way guard. Dailey Jr. and Bilodeau provide two more skilled forwards who can score inside and out. When your best four players have this much game, you have a chance at a special year.Potential weaknesses: Will Michigan State transfer Booker and San Diego transfer Jamerson II fix UCLA's interior defensive issues. In 19 Quad 1 games, opponents shot 72% at the rim against UCLA when big man Aday Mara was not on the floor, per CBB Analytics. That ranked in the second (!) percentile nationally.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    13. ArizonaProjected starting lineupG Jaden BradleyG Brayden BurriesG Anthony Dell'OrsoF Koa PeatF Tobe AwakaTop reserves: C Motiejus Krivas, F Ivan Kharchenkov, G/F Dwayne Aristode, C Sidi Gueye, G Evan NelsonBiggest strengths: Arizona's paint-dominance recipe is not going anywhere with Peat, Awaka and Krivas leading the charge. Arizona will be one of the superior rebounding teams in the country, and it has the athletes to crush opponents in transition.Potential weaknesses: Arizona was playing its best basketball last year when it had a center on the floor who could hit 3-pointers. On paper, that doesn't seem to be in the cards with Awaka and Krivas splitting time at the 5. What counters does Tommy Lloyd have in his bag?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    14. ArkansasProjected starting lineupG DJ WagnerG Darius AcuffG/F Karter KnoxF Trevon BrazileF Nick PringleTop reserves: F Malique Ewin, G/F Billy Richmond III, G Meleek Thomas, G/F Isaiah SealyBiggest strengths: Arkansas' raw athleticism jumps off the tape. Knox, Brazile and Richmond are ridiculous athletes who breathe different air than the rest of us. Pringle is so big and strong inside. Acuff and Wagner are twitchy, chiseled lead guards. The Hogs can overwhelm you in a hurry. Potential weaknesses: Role allocation is something this team has to figure out. Is Acuff the alpha? Is it Knox? Ewin will want his touches. Thomas is wired to score when he checks in. Wagner still has those moments where he wants to go make a play. The collection of talent is obvious, but Arkansas' pecking order is far from settled.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    15. AlabamaProjected starting lineupG Labaron PhilonG Aden HollowayG Latrell Wrightsell Jr. F Taylor Bol BowenF Aiden SherrellTop reserves: G Jalil Bethea (when healthy), G Houston Mallette, C Noah Williamson, F London Jemison, G Davion Hannah, F Amari AllenBiggest strengths: Alabama was 20-3 when it scored at least 15 transition points last year, and the Crimson Tide have the personnel to copy that blueprint again. Both Philon and Holloway can go in the open floor, and Nate Oats will be winding his arm like a third-base coach on the sideline. Don't overlook the addition of Bol Bowen, who can also take it off the glass and push the break. When Wrightsell and Bethea get back to 100%, Alabama's going to unleash an avalanche of those ultra-valuable transition 3-pointers.Potential weaknesses: Alabama had a cavalry of switchable frontcourt wings and forwards that you need to survive in the SEC, but Grant Nelson exhausted his eligibility and Mouhamed Dioubate, Derrion Reid and Jarin Stevenson transferred. Oats needs defensive stoppers to emerge on the wing. Bol Bowen will get the first crack, but keep an eye on Jemsion and Allen. Both four-star freshmen have excellent positional size and could use defense to crack this rotation. Alabama needs at least one of them to hit in a big way.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    16. Iowa StateProjected starting lineupG Tamin LipseyG Jamarion BatemonF Milan MomcilovicF Joshua JeffersonF Blake BuchananTop reserves: G Nate Heise, G Dominick Nelson, F Eric Mulder, F Dominykas Pleta, G Killyan Toure, G Cade KeldermanBiggest strengths: There's comfort in consistency, and Iowa State has it with Lipsey, Momcilovic and Jefferson returning. Lipsey and Jefferson are two of the best defenders in the country at their respective positions, and Momcilovic is a total bucket who knows the defensive scheme like the back of his hand. A mobile big man like Buchanan should be a nifty fit for an Iowa State defense that should be a top-five unit in America. Potential weaknesses: Does this backcourt have enough on-ball juice? Iowa State is banking on Lipsey staying healthy and returning to his All-American form, but freshman Batemon might need to be a dude right away. Iowa State is so clearly a good team, but it looks one guard short of the top tier of national title contenders. The dynamic transition attacks from Keshon Gilbert and the Curtis Jones heaters will be sorely missed.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    17. IllinoisProjected starting lineupG Mihailo PetrovicG Kylan BoswellG Andrej StojakovicF Ben HumrichousC Tomislav IvisicTop reserves: G Mihailo Petrovic, C Zvonimir Ivisic, F David Mirkovic, G Keaton Wagler, G Brandon Lee, F Jake Davis, F Ty Rodgers (when healthy)Biggest strengths: Brad Underwood's offense is about to sizzle. 7-foot center Tomislav Ivisic is the ultimate lid-lifter with his shower of 3-pointers and gorgeous over-the-top dimes. Illinois shot a scalding 70% at the rim when Ivisic was on the floor last year, and the paint will be wide open for physical drivers like Boswell and Stojakovic to eat. Illinois' transition offense should bounce back in a major way with speedy guards like Petrovic and Boswell pushing the pace, and keep an eye on freshman Keaton Wagler, who has impressed with his shot-making, poise and feel. I have Illinois rated as the sixth-best offense in the country (KenPom echoed that projection a few months later!). That may end up being too low for the Balkan Boys. This offense has so many outs to create good looks.Potential weaknesses: Illinois has a ton of size up front, and Boswell is one of the best five point of attack defenders in the country. But this is not the most athletic roster, and the Illini have been a bit snakebitten with minor injuries in the preseason to their top dawgs. Tomislav Ivisic (tonsillectomy), Stojakovic (knee sprain) and Petrovic (eligibility red tape) have all missed chunks of time, and that doesn't even factor in Rodgers' serious knee injury. Illinois is trying to implement a new defensive scheme under new assistant Camryn Crocker without major pieces on the floor. There could be some growing pains because the defensive chemistry has not been established yet.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    18. TennesseeProjected starting lineupG Ja'Kobi GillespieG Amaree AbramF Nate AmentF Cade PhillipsC Felix OkparaTop reserves: F Jaylen Carey, F JP Estrella, G Ethan Burg, G Bishop Boswell, F DeWayne Brown, G/F Amari EvansBiggest strengths: Tennessee has some ludicrous defensive lineups that it can trot out. Gillespie is a solid defender, Ament has excellent defensive tools, Phillips is an outstanding interior defender that no one knows about yet and Okpara is one of the best shot-blockers in the SEC. Even without Zakai Zeigler and Jahmai Mashack, Tennessee's defense will be vicious. Good luck scoring in. the paint against that front-line trio of Ament, Phillips and Zeigler. Potential weaknesses: There will be a heavy load on Gillespie and Ament to run the show offensively. Can a third guy emerge? Keep an eye on Estrella, who might be Tennessee's most talented offensive big man. He just missed a huge chunk of last year with a foot injury and he's already missed time this preseason with a nasty ankle sprain. If he can get on the floor, Estrella's soft touch in the paint can help this Vols' offense immensely. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    19. KansasProjected starting lineupG Darryn PetersonG Melvin Council Jr.G Jayden DawsonF Tre WhiteF Flory BidungaTop reserves: G Elmarko Jackson, F Bryson Tiller, C Paul Mbiya, G Kohl Rosario, G Jamari McDowellBiggest strengths: Kansas desperately needed more pep from the lead guard spot. Insert Peterson, who could very well cement himself as the best player in the Big 12, a First Team All-American and the unquestioned No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft. Kansas' playbook can expand with Peterson at the helm, and his flurry of stutter-step drives, in-your-eyehole treys and unselfish playmaking will give Bill Self the engine it needs to go. Peterson is going to post ludicrous counting stats in 2025-26.Oh, and Kansas can pair a future lottery pick with the bones of an impressive defense that can grind teams into a pulp. It has big, physical guards. It has a terrifying rim protector in Bidunga, and the threat of a double-big lineup if Self chooses to toss Mbiya into the fray. Even without any continuity, Kansas can be one of the Big 12's best defenses.Potential weaknesses: This may be one of the most unproven bench groups that Self has ever had. Kansas doesn't have that second-unit dude who can change the game in a flash. Can Jackson get healthy after missing all of last year? Is Tiller ready to be a piece and live up to the early recruiting hype? Can Rosario, a reclassified freshman from OTE, settle in as a 3-and-D role player? Can Mbiya play next to Bidunga or is he strictly going to be a backup 5-man? Kansas has lots of roles to figure out in the preseason.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    20. AuburnProjected starting lineupG Tahaad PettifordG Kevin OvertonF Elyjah FreemanF Keyshawn Hall F KeShawn MurphyTop reserves: F Filip Jovic, G Kaden Magwood, C Emeka Opurum, G Abdul Bashir, F Sebastian Williams-AdamsBiggest strengths: Auburn may very well be the best isolation scoring team in America. Pettiford, Hall, Murphy and Magwood can all create something for themselves in a jiffy. Auburn should be able to build its entire offense off the bucket-getting brilliance.Potential weaknesses: The Tigers' rim protection seems destined to take a significant step back without Johni Broome and Dylan Cardwell patrolling the paint. I'm curious how it changes the structure of this defense, and how long it takes for this new-look team to find consistency and synergy on that end.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    21. GonzagaProjected starting lineupG Braeden SmithG Adam MillerG/F Tyon Grant-Foster (if eligible)F Braden HuffF Graham IkeTop reserves: G Mario Saint-Supery, G Emmanuel Innocenti, F Steele Venters, C Ismaila Diagne, G/F Jalen Warley, G/F Davis FogleBiggest strengths: Gonzaga is on the verge of unleashing a dangerous double-big lineup of Ike and Huff, and the ripple effects are obvious. Gonzaga's transition ethos isn't going anywhere. It will get you in the bonus. It will generate a paint touch and play off it. The Zags shot 69% at the rim last season -- which ranked in the 96th percentile nationally -- and the Ike-Huff duo should keep the train rolling. The frontcourt is going to carry this team.Potential weaknesses: Gonzaga has so much depth on the wing, but can some two-way players emerge outside of Adam Miller and Grant-Foster (if cleared). Innocenti is a whale of a defender, but the offense leaves room to be desired. Venters can make jumpers, but how's the lateral movement defensively after two years of leg injuries? Can Warley (a non-shooter) play with Ike and Huff? Some tinkering seems imminent for this sharp Gonzaga coaching staff to figure out the right combinations to fully weaponize this deep club.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    22. Michigan StateProjected starting lineupG Jeremy Fears Jr.G Trey FortF Coen CarrF Jaxon KohlerC Carson CooperTop reserves: G Kur Teng, F Cam Ward, G Divine Ugochukwu, F Jesse McCulloch, G/F Jordan ScottBiggest strengths: Michigan State should smother teams defensively. Fears has clamps, Carr is the most athletic player in the country and both Kohler and Cooper are immovable, stout interior defenders. That quartet also demands defensive buy-in from the rest of the roster, while covering up some of their warts. Michigan State could certainly have the top defensive unit in the Big Ten.Potential weaknesses: Fears, Carr, Kohler and Cooper all need to add more to their offensive portfolios for MSU to be allowed to play its best defensive lineup. Offseason buzz is what it is. We'll start to see if the offensive gains are real when Michigan State hosts Bowling Green for an exhibition in less than 10 days. That Oct. 28 exhibition against UConn will be illuminating, too.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    23. CreightonProjected starting lineupG Nik GravesG Josh DixG/F Blake HarperF Jackson McAndrewF Owen FreemanTop reserves: G Fedor Zugic, G Austin Swartz, F Jasen Green, F Isaac Traudt, G Hudson Greer, G Ty Davis Biggest strengths: It's almost a felony to play for Creighton and not be able to drain 3-pointers. Creighton's barrage of snipers will come at you in waves. Every single guy in this rotation can make a jumper if you leave him open. Very few teams can say that. Dix, McAndrew and Freeman are the top dawgs, though. Dix is one of the most efficient three-level scorers in America, and McAndrew can heat up from well beyond NBA range in a New York second. All that space should help Freeman pour in buckets in the paint at will. Creighton's offense has such a high floor under Greg McDermott.Potential weaknesses: There are loads of defensive questions littered up and down the roster. Is Dix the best perimeter defender on this team? If so, that's probably not an ideal sign. Can Freeman get healthy and execute Creighton's drop coverage-happy scheme? \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    24. WisconsinProjected starting lineupG Nick BoydG John BlackwellG Andrew RohdeF Austin RappF Nolan WinterTop reserves: G Braeden Carrington, G Jack Janicki, C Will Garlock, F Elijah Gray, G Hayden Jones, C Aleksas Bieliauskas, G Zach KinzigerBiggest strengths: Even without prized offensive coordinator Kirk Penney, Wisconsin still has the personnel to turbo-smash offensively. Boyd, Blackwell and Rohde are three guards who can make reads in ball screens or operate as off-ball snipers. Wisconsin's frontcourt duo of Rapp and Winter will have the freedom to go \"bombs away\" from downtown. The Badgers could certainly get more treys from their frontcourt than almost any other high-major team. Potential weaknesses: There is a ton on Winter's plate to anchor this defense effectively. He's packed on weight to his 7-foot frame, and his combination of length, athleticism and shot-blocking potential is intriguing. If he's a game-changer defensively, Wisconsin's ceiling is very high. But that's a big if.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    25. North CarolinaProjected starting lineupG Kyan EvansG Seth TrimbleG Luka BogavacF Caleb WilsonC Henri VeesaarTop reserves: F Jarin Stevenson, G Derek Dixon, G Jonathan Powell, G Jaydon Young, F Zayden High, F James Brown, G Isaiah DenisBiggest strengths: UNC has a nasty point of attack defender in Trimble, an excellent hybrid wing/forward defender in Wilson and a mobile shot-blocker inside with Veesaar. UNC has buffed up its athleticism in a serious way. If this defense is not much improved, something seriously went wrong.Potential weaknesses: This roster is jam-packed with combo guards. Evans, Dixon, Trimble, Bogavac and Young can all play with the ball in their hands, but there's no true initiator point guard on the roster. Who emerges as the organizer and sets the table effectively?\n            ",

This year, we've added a column for those of you who play in four-point-per-pass TD leagues, and a column for half-PPR leagues! Yes finally.               The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart.               By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has two or more players than the other. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).              \nThis list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.               Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my updated projected rest of season schedule rankings available on SportsLine later this week.                   \nYou can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at drichard@cbs.com or at @daverichard on X.

Gardner-Johnson from their practice squad in what was described as an \"amicable mutual decision,\" according to ESPN. This move comes one week after the Ravens traded pass rusher Odafe Oweh and a 2027 seventh-round pick to the Los Angeles Chargers for defensive back Alohi Gilman and a 2026 fifth-round pick.The Ravens signed Gardner-Johnson to their practice squad Oct. 7 after the Houston Texans released him. The Texans acquired Gardner-Johnson via a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles in March but cut ties with him just three games into the 2025 season. \"It was my decision to move on,\" coach DeMeco Ryans said at the time. \"I know what's best for my team. ... Coming from me, the head coach, it was the best for our team. That's why I made the decision.\"The 27-year-old Gardner-Johnson started a career-high 16 games for the Eagles last season and was in the lineup for their Super Bowl 59 victory against the Kansas City Chiefs. He logged 59 total tackles, tied his career best with six interceptions and 12 pass deflections. \nA former fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, Gardner-Johnson led the NFL with six interceptions during his first stint with the Eagles in 2022. He spent the first three years of his career with the New Orleans Saints. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 7 NFL schedule has several interesting quirks which could add a bit more interest to NFL picks. Patriots vs. Titans sees New England on the road for the third straight week, and the Pats, led by former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, are  touchdown favorites as they look to complete this road trip 3-0. Additionally, the Chiefs fans will get to see their team take part in a 1 p.m. ET kickoff for the only time through the first 11 weeks of the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City is an 11.5-point home favorite, per the latest Week  NFL odds, as they host the Raiders.Then, a Monday night doubleheader sees the Texans visiting the Seahawks in the nightcap at 10 p.m. ET. This is just the second time in the last 20 years that the Texans will play at Seattle, with the home team favored by 3.5 points. Week 7 NFL picks could account for several factors from recent performance to NFL betting trends to scheduling oddities.

Philly is coming off a mini-bye after playing last Thursday, but Minnesota is coming off a full bye after covering versus Cleveland in Week 5. Covering, or winning, isn't something that the Eagles have done recently as they're 0-2 both against the spread and straight up over their last two games. The Philly offense is in shambles as its two lowest point totals over the last calendar year have come in its two most recent contests.Since the start of last year, Minnesota has the second-best spread record overall (14-8-1), as well as the second-best spread record at home (7-3). As for the Eagles, they haven't shown a tendency to bounce back versus the line after outright defeats, which is what they're coming off with a Thursday loss to the Giants. Philadelphia is only 3-7 against the spread after a straight-up loss since the start of the 2023 season. The model has Minnesota prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 7 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7, 40) cover versus the Giants in well over 50% of simulations. Bo Nix is a perfect 6-0 against the spread versus NFC opponents in his career and is also 7-1 versus the line as a home favorite. A big part of that is Denver having the most ferocious pass rush the NFL has possibly ever seen. Last year, Denver's 63 sacks were the most in the league and the second-most by any team over the last two decades. This year, Denver is on pace for an NFL record of 85 sacks which would shatter the record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears.Now, the Broncos get to face a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart who gets sacked at the ninth-highest rate in the league. Dart has looked impressive at home but had three turnovers in his lone road start at New Orleans, which was both a defeat and a spread loss for New York. After taking down one New York quarterback in Justin Fields nine times in Week 6, Denver is projected to take down another, in Dart, at least five times on Sunday, as the Broncos are forecasted to win by double-digits. The model also says the Over hits well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 7 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 7 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by nearly 70% of simulations, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        A couple of weeks ago, Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier blasted league commissioner Cathy Engelbert during her exit interview and shook up the negotiations between the WNBA Players Association and WNBA over the new collective bargaining agreement. South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley, one of the biggest names in women's basketball, was asked for her opinion on Collier's statement during Tuesday's SEC media day.\"It sounds like it's personal in her perspective of the situation. And I think people have to understand they're negotiating, right?\" Staley said. \"So in negotiations, like any other issues that come up, there's always going to be an emotional attachment to it and then there's facts. Once we get down to the facts, I do think it's going to get done.\"Both of them are playing the sides they need to play. I think it was brave of Phee to step out there and put her name on the line when it comes to where the players stand. And at the same time, you look at Cathy Engelbert and I don't think there's another commissioner that has accomplished what she has for the state of women's professional basketball. So they're negotiating. It's part of it.\"The South Carolina coach, who played in the WNBA from 1999-2006, brings an interesting perspective because there were not a lot of opportunities for women's basketball players early in her career. In fact, Staley used to dream of playing in the NBA because there was no WNBA when she was growing up. Now, she is one of the top college basketball coaches at a time when women's sports are gaining immense popularity.\nStaley saw 10 of her former players listed on a WNBA roster this season, including Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson who is fresh off her fourth MVP title and her third WNBA championship. In her statement, Collier relayed personal conversations she had with Engelbert earlier this year. She accused the commissioner of saying that \"players should be on their knees thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them,\" and that Caitlin Clark in particular should be \"grateful\" for the league because \"without the platform the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything.\" Engelbert said Collier mischaracterized their meeting and denied saying that Clark should be grateful.\"Our leadership's answer to being held accountable is to suppress everyone's voices by handing out fines. I'm not concerned about a fine. I'm concerned about the future of our sport,\" Collier said. \"At some point, everyone deserves to hear the truth from someone who I hope has earned the benefit of the doubt to fight for what is right and fair for our athletes and our fans. We have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now we have the worst leadership in the world.\nIf the league and the WNBPA can't come to an agreement by Oct. 31, there will need to be a deadline extension to avoid a lockout.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the NFL season opened, the Buffalo Bills were -260 at FanDuel to win the AFC East, the best odds of any team to win its division.Yet just over a month into the season, it's the New England Patriots who lead the AFC East. Both New England and Buffalo are 4-2, but the Patriots hold the tiebreaker thanks to their impressive 23-20 win in Buffalo in Week 5. In Week 6, the Bills lost in prime time again, this time 24-14 to the Falcons, a day after the Patriots handled the Saints 25-19.The Bills remain the betting favorite to win the AFC East, though they are down to -230, while the Patriots' odds have shortened from +550 before the season began to +190 currently. And while teams can only play the ones they're scheduled, it's worth noting the Bills' wins are against the Ravens (1-5), the Jets (0-6), Dolphins (1-5) and the Saints (1-5), and only the New York victory was a convinving one.So as the Bills head into their bye week, they're not focused on the division or the playoffs or anything that far down the road. Rather, they're trying to figure out how to work their way out of the two-game slump they're in, one that has seen letdowns on offense and defense and significant health issues as well.\n\"Well, starting with injuries, we've got a number of guys that are banged up and came out of the game, and so that'll be important for us, hopefully getting some of those guys back, we'll see,\" coach Sean McDermott said after Monday night's game. \"There's no guarantee on that, number one. Like I said, I appreciate the way the guys battled to the end. At the end of the day, we've got to go back now -- in addition to getting guys healthier, and we'll see how that goes -- [and] figure out things on offense, defense and special teams.\"We're going to start over and start from ground zero and figure this thing out and work our tails off to do it.\"Can the Bills be fixed? Do they need to be? Just two weeks ago, this was one of two undefeated teams in the NFL. Now, as McDermott said, they have questions to answer in all three phases.\n\n        \n            \n                Overreactions from 'MNF': Bills wasting Josh Allen's prime? Sophomore slump for Jayden Daniels?\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat's wrong with Josh Allen?Make no mistake: The Falcons' defense is legit. Atlanta is allowing the fewest yards per game in the NFL (253.4) and held Buffalo to 291, by far its fewest of the season. But two things can be true at once. Atlanta can have a really good defense, and Allen can play poorly.That was the case Monday night, when Allen threw two interceptions -- he had thrown just two all year entering the game -- and was sacked four times, his most in a game since Week 1, 2023. Allen has now thrown an interception in three straight games, and the Bills, who hadn't lost the turnover battle in an NFL-record 26 straight games entering Week 5, have now lost it twice in a row.While Allen has vastly improved his ball security, turnovers can be a thing that comes in waves for him, and perhaps this is that wave. Last year, he threw six interceptions, but five came in a four-week span in the middle of the season. Perhaps that wave is just arriving a bit earlier this year. Plus, the two Monday night came right before halftime and in desperation mode late.\nThe pressure might be the more pressing issue. The Falcons pressured Allen on 49% of his dropbacks, his highest rate since Week 2, 2024. Allen praised the Bills' variety of blitz looks coming in off a bye, but on multiple occasions, he took responsibility.\"I have to do better,\" he said. \"Protections, IDs, movement in the pocket. It has to be better.\"Pro Football Focus \"credited\" Allen for 21% of the pressures he faced, eighth-highest in the league in Week 6.\nHere was a big one: Two Falcons fly in untouched. If Allen gets his vision to his left, he sees a wide-open Khalil Shakir. It's easy for me to click pause on a replay while sitting at my desk, of course, but this is one he'll want back.\nAllen's unease in the pocket has led to some poor outcomes, too. Allen produced a paltry -0.14 expected points added per play outside the pocket, his worst since Week 4, 2024, and over the past couple of weeks, he has bailed from some pockets early.\n\"It doesn't need to be that hard all the time, where [Josh Allen]'s having to run out of the pocket,\" McDermott said. \"I thought at times we picked up the pressure, and then at other times it was the pocket was getting affected early. So, the rush and cover, as you know, we talk a lot about that. It was disrupting our offense too early in the game.\"\nAgain, Allen can have these streaks. His superpower abilities can also make things harder than they need to be. Of all of Buffalo's issues, Allen's are by far the least worrying.Do the Bills need to trade for a wide receiver?Buffalo was without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) in Week 6 and lost Josh Palmer (ankle) during the game. When McDermott talks health, he's likely focusing significantly on those guys.After a monster Week 1, Keon Coleman is yet to top four catches or 45 yards. He's a big-bodied, contested-catch guy. Slot maven Shakir operates almost exclusively underneath. His 5.1 air yards per target are third-fewest among 76 qualifying wide receivers. Without Samuel and Palmer, the Bills used a lot of lanky deep threat Tyrell Shavers and journeyman Elijah Moore. Shavers caught three of five targets for 27 yards, and Moore didn't catch either of his targets.\nThe Bills knew they didn't have a ton of star power in their receiving room. That's how they have operated each of the past two seasons after trading away Stefon Diggs. Allen's do-it-all abilities, plus a strong offensive line and running game, hoped to cover that. Even last year, Buffalo traded for Amari Cooper, though that didn't really work out.Could another trade be on the horizon? Perhaps, but it's not likely to be a true needle mover -- more in the range of a Cooper-like deal in all likelihood.Really, getting Kincaid back would be key. Yes, it's precarious to depend on an oft-injured, inconsistent tight end, but Allen has a 156.1(!) passer rating when targeting Kincaid: 20 for 24 for 287 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Kincaid's presence as a downfield threat who can lineup inside and outside completely changes the complexion of Buffalo's offense.\nRush defense in shamblesRecent Bills teams haven't had particularly good rushing defenses, but they've never been this bad: 5.8 yards per carry allowed is worst in the NFL this year.Buffalo gave up 238 yards rushing to the Ravens in Week 1, 189 to the Saints in Week 4 and 210 to the Falcons in Week 6. They've been unable to stop the bruisers (Derrick Henry), the gliders (Bijan Robinson), the shifty ones (Alvin Kamara) and the quarterbacks (Lamar Jackson, Justin Fields and even Spencer Rattler).In Week 6, the Bills had neither linebacker Matt Milano nor defensive lineman DaQuan Jones, who hurt his calf in warmups. Still, even when those two have been on the field, run defense has been a major issue. McDermott addressed the tackling issues -- Buffalo is tied for PFF's second-worst tackling grade -- but there aren't easy fixes here. Milano isn't the All-Pro Milano of a few years ago. Safties Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp both struggle in the run game; fittingly, Robinson ran through a Bishop tackle attempt on the biggest play of the night.\nThe Bills also haven't helped themselves with penalties: 30 in the past three weeks, second in the NFL. Monday, that featured five defensive penalties, including three offside/encroachment flags. One nullified a Robinson fumble on the first play of the game.Effective defenses either create havoc (turnovers, negative plays) or play consistently down-to-down. Right now, the Bills are doing neither.\"We need to tackle better,\" Joey Bosa said. \"We need to get the ball off of them. We need turnovers. It's not good for defense. Penalties hurt us. They maybe were aggressive penalties, whatever. We just have to be smarter.\"\nIs it the Patriots' time to win the AFC East?The Bills have won the division five straight years. It's far, far too early to write them off. For all the stretches of struggles has has, Allen can get unstoppable for other stretches. Buffalo will get healthier after the bye and then get the Panthers and Dolphins as two of their next three opponents. Four of their final five games are against either teams really struggling -- the Bengals, Browns and Jets -- or the Patriots themselves, a perfect opportunity for revenge late in the season. And who knows what the fifth team in that group, the Eagles, will look like by then? They, like the Bills were 4-0 and are now 4-2.Since their AFC East dynasty began in 2020, the Bills are an NFL-best 18-3 in December. Their best ball is likely ahead of them, and Allen helped put everything in perspective.\"I think we were 3-2 last year,\" he said. \"Sitting at 4-2 going into a bye week. At any point you can have a winning season almost halfway through the year -- I know we're not quite halfway, but I think I'll take those odds.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ten months ago, the Phoenix Mercury decided to rip everything up and start over. In the space of one offseason, they built a brand new roster through a series of trades and bold free agent signings. Out went franchise icons Diana Taurasi (retirement) and Brittney Griner (free agency), and in came All-Star forwards Alyssa Thomas and Satou Sabally. On opening night of the 2025 season, the only players remaining from the 2024 team were Kahleah Copper and Natasha Mack. No one knew exactly how the Mercury's experiment would work. In Thomas, Sabally and Copper, they had an MVP candidate and two other All-Star talents. The rest of the roster was largely unproven aside from a few vets. The regular season results were good, but not great. Thomas, Sabally and Copper were limited to 27 games together due to various injuries, and the Mercury went 15-12 in those contests. Overall, they finished 27-17 with the sixth-best net rating (plus-3.2) and were the No. 4 seed heading into the playoffs. Despite having home-court advantage in the first round, they were the underdogs against the reigning champion New York Liberty and lost Game 1 in overtime. It seemed like they might head home early, but they stunned the Liberty in Barclays Center in Game 2, then won a nail-biter in Game 3 to clinch their first playoff series victory since 2021. \nIn the semifinals, they were once again given little chance against the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx. And after losing Game 1 and falling behind by 20 in Game 2, their campaign was indeed on the ropes. They pulled off a remarkable comeback to win Game 2 in overtime, then won thrillers at home in Games 3 and 4 -- the latter via another huge comeback. All of a sudden, the Mercury were in the Finals for the first time since 2021, and the franchise had the opportunity to tie the Houston Comets, Minnesota Lynx and Seattle Storm for the most titles ever. This time, they were given a chance against the Las Vegas Aces, but it was not to be. They blew Game 1, got crushed in Game 2, nearly pulled off a miraculous comeback in Game 3 before A'ja Wilson hit a last-second game winner and had another comeback effort fall short in Game 4. Along the way, Sami Whitcomb hyperextended her knee, Sabally suffered a concussion that kept her out of Game 4 and Thomas dealt with hand and shoulder issues. The Mercury's 2025 campaign was a success, but getting swept in the Finals leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. It's also impossible to ignore that the Mercury benefited from major injury luck in the first two rounds -- Breanna Stewart, Leonie Fiebich, Napheesa Collier and DiJonai Carrington all either missed time or were hobbled -- before having it flip the other way in the Finals. And, while the Mercury's resilience has to be applauded, they trailed by double digits in six of their eight games in the last two rounds, and were forced to make multiple historic comebacks.  \nGeneral manager Nick U'Ren and coach Nate Tibbetts will now have the unenviable task of fully assessing the season and plotting a course forward. Blowing up a Finals team is not something that can be done lightly, but many aspects of the Mercury's Finals run were unsustainable. U'Ren summed things up well during his exit interview last week: \"We have no idea what's coming for us.\"Season at a glanceRecord: 27-17 (No. 4 seed)Offensive rating: 103.6 (7th)Defensive rating: 100.4 (5th)Net rating: plus-3.2 (6th)Biggest strengthDefense/physicalityThe Mercury only had the fifth-ranked defense during the regular season, but that was due to injuries. When their primary starting lineup was healthy, they boasted an 88.4 defensive rating. And as we saw in the playoffs, no one could match their athleticism, toughness and physicality when they really dialed things up. Thomas remains a force of nature and led the way -- she finished fourth in Defensive Player of the Year voting -- but everyone in the Mercury's starting lineup was a plus defender. \nBiggest weaknessConsistent offenseThe Mercury had as much top-tier offensive talent as anyone in the league, but they never fully clicked on that side of the ball. Injuries and a lack of continuity played a part -- Thomas, Sabally and Copper only played 27 times together in the regular season -- as did a lack of elite shooting, which allowed opponents to pack the paint. The latter was a particular issue in the playoffs, when the Mercury shot 30.9% from behind the arc. Their decision making and shot selection also often left something to be desired. Key free agentsMonique Akoa Makani (reserved)DeWanna Bonner (unrestricted)Kahleah Copper (unrestricted)Natasha Mack (reserved)Satou Sabally (unrestricted)Alyssa Thomas (unrestricted)Kathryn Westbeld (reserved)Sami Whitcomb (unrestricted)This will be the most unique free agency period (and offseason as a whole) in league history. The WNBPA and WNBA are in the process of negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement that will bring substantial raises whenever it is ratified, and as a result, nearly every player who is not on a rookie scale deal has maneuvered to be a free agent this winter. One of the two veterans that does have a guaranteed deal is Mercury center Kalani Brown. Even with Brown under contract -- she signed the deal with the Dallas Wings and was acquired by the Mercury last offseason as part of the Sabally trade -- the Mercury still have a number of key free agents, just like every other team. Thomas, Sabally and Copper lead the bunch. \nU'Ren made it clear during his exit interview that their plan is to bring Thomas back and build the team around her. You would expect Sabally and Copper to be back, but U'Ren was not making any guarantees, especially for anyone beyond the Big Three. \"We just did all our exit interviews and I always just err on the side of honesty, even if that means uncertainty,\" U'Ren said. \"I told everybody over and over, 'We have no idea what's coming for us.'\"They're going to have decisions to make based on their career, their family. We're going to have decisions to make based on our team. We can have all our hopes, desires and plans at this point in time, but no one knows until the CBA gets done.\" \nAssuming the Mercury bring back Thomas, Sabally and Copper, the big challenge for U'Ren will be to figure out how to boost their offense while maintaining their defensive identity.  In the playoffs, they were often at their best when they replaced Akoa Makani and Mack with Whitcomb and Bonner, who could space the floor around the Big Three. Whitcomb is 37 and Bonner is 38, however, and neither is a long-term solution. Until the new CBA is in place and we know the rules for free agency, as well as key numbers such as the 2026 salary cap and the new maximum, minimum and rookie salaries, it's too difficult to predict exactly what the Mercury will do, but they should be an attractive destination after a Finals appearance. Draft outlookNos. 27 and 42The Mercury traded their 2026 first-round pick to the Chicago Sky as part of the Copper trade ahead of the 2024 season. That pick will actually now wind up with the Connecticut Sun, but all that matters from the Mercury's perspective is that they don't have it. \nThe only selections the Mercury will have next spring are their second- and third-round picks at Nos. 27 and 42, respectively. While they won't just throw those selections away, it's going to be difficult for them to find a contributor that late in the process. Historically, late second- and third-round picks rarely even make rosters. Though the draft won't be a particularly important night for the Mercury this year, they do have the draft rights to 24-year-old Spanish guard Helena Pueyo, who will be worth watching overseas this winter. The Mercury had success in the international market last offseason when they signed Akoa Makani to be their starting point guard, and could bring Pueyo over if they feel she's ready. \n            ",

In 2002, he succeeded Jon Gruden as Raiders coach and helped lead the franchise to its most recent Super Bowl appearance (ironically, the Raiders lost to Gruden's Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII). Callahan enjoyed a successful run as the Browns' offensive line coach prior to serving the same role on his son's staff in Nashville. But during his two seasons with the Titans, Callahan's unit struggled to protect the quarterback. Tennessee's passers were sacked 52 times in 2024, and rookie Cam Ward has been sacked a league-high 25 times this season. \n\n        \n            \n                Titans coaching search: Chiefs' Matt Nagy and Steelers' Arthur Smith among names to watch, per report\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the offensive line did help Tony Pollard rush for over 1,000 yards in 2024, the Titans are just 31st in the NFL in rushing this season and are also just 29th in rushing touchdowns scored and 25th in average yards per carry. Brian Callahan, 41, went just 4-19 during his short stint as the Titans' coach. Prior to coming to Nashville, he enjoyed a successful five-year run as the Bengals' offensive coordinator that included a Super Bowl appearance in 2021. \nThe Titans will now be temporarily led by McCoy, a longtime NFL coach who served as the Chargers' head coach from 2013-16. McCoy, who served as the Jaguars' quarterbacks coach from 2022-24, had been serving as Titans' senior offensive assistant prior to accepting his new role as interim coach. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        After a nail-biting Game 1 of the Dodgers-Brewers NLCS, in which the Dodgers survived with a 2-1 victory, Game 2 happens in Milwaukee on Tuesday night. It'll be two frontline starters in Yoshinobu Yamamoto of the Dodgers against Freddy Peralta of the Brewers. The Brewers shouldn't be desperate or anything, but they do really need this game in a bad way. Falling down 0-2 after two home games before hitting the road really makes it tough to win the series. \nLet's dive in. Lines for tonight's game are courtesy of BetMGM.Brewers +100I have several points here. The first one is that Blake Snell won the game for the Dodgers in Game 1 with his dominant eight innings, taking so much pressure off that possibly leaky Dodgers' bullpen. Yamamoto hasn't been quite as dominant in the playoffs, so the concern from the Dodgers' end is that he only lasts, say, six innings and then the bullpen needs to get three in what I expect to be a close game. Yamamoto had an awful outing at Milwaukee in the regular season, too. The next point is that Peralta had a 1.77 ERA at home this season. Combine those and I believe we're looking at a close game into the middle innings. The Dodgers' bullpen has plenty of cracks and, after Game 1, it looks like we can add Roki Sasaki to the list of concerns. I'll take the Brewers winning this one late. The final point: I just have a gut feeling that these Brewers aren't going down 0-2 at home in this series. They haven't gone quietly all year. Why start now? The Dodgers are great and maybe even have more talent than the Brewers, but this isn't the David vs. Goliath battle some would have us believe. \nFreddie Freeman over 1.5 H+R+RBI (+100)This might be a bit of a hedge here, but if the Dodgers generate any offense in this game, I expect 'Playoff Freddie' to be involved. He hit a home run and doubled in Game 1. He now has 15 home runs, 37 RBI and 35 runs in 69 playoff games with a .274/.370/.514 line. The pitching matchup isn't overly daunting for Freeman, given that it's a right-hander in Peralta taking the ball for the Brewers. And Freeman isn't even bad against lefties, so even if the Brewers feed him lefties starting in the middle innings, we should still be fine.\n            \n    ",

The only two prior matchups included games between Tom Brady and Drew Brees that both took place during the 2020 season. \"I think it's great for all the old guys,\" Rodgers said of his upcoming matchup with Flacco. \"I know that when I watch other sports, maybe it's because I'm the older guy, I tend to pull for the older guys to win championships. ... I've known Joe for a long time. He's been great coming to my charity event. He's been a great ambassador for the league. He's had a great career, and it's fun that we're both still playing.\" Rodgers has been playing at an exceptionally high level this season, his first with the Steelers. The four-time MVP enters Thursday night's game with 10 touchdowns (against just two interceptions) and is completing 68.8% of his passes while helping lead Pittsburgh to a 4-1 start. \nWhile Flacco hasn't been as good, his situation this season has been vastly different. The former Super Bowl MVP was the Browns' opening day starter before being benched in favor of rookie Dillon Gabriel after just four games. He was then dealt to the Bengals in a trade that Steelers coach Mike Tomlin referred to as \"shocking\" earlier this week.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 7 picks and score predictions: Bengals shock Steelers, Rams top Jaguars in London\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n Less than a week after joining the Bengals, Flacco started and threw for 219 yards and two touchdowns during Cincinnati's Week 6 loss to the Packers in Green Bay. Tomlin's clear annoyance with the Browns dealing Flacco to Cincinnati is understandable. Instead of facing Jake Browning, Tomlin's team will instead have to face a quarterback in Flacco who has played the Steelers 25 times over his 18-year career. During their most recent encounter, Flacco came off the bench in Week 3 of the 2024 season to lead the Colts to an upset win over the previously unbeaten Steelers.\nThursday night's is a big one for both teams. For the Steelers, it's a chance to increase their stranglehold over the rest of the field in the AFC North standings. Conversely, the Bengals need a win to increase their odds of playing meaningful football deep into the 2025 season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After Charles Oliveira's emotional submission win over Mateusz Gamrot last Saturday, which reminded everyone that the soon-to-be 36-year-old \"Do Bronx\" has still got it in a major way, the UFC's lightweight division couldn't be anymore red hot or unpredictable at the moment. In light of that, it's time to take a restock of the UFC's rankings at 155 pounds to determine who has the best shot of one day unseating new champion Ilia Topuria and who looks more like a pretender in the pursuit of the throne. In descending order, here are the true power players in the lightweight division.\n        \n            \n                Max Holloway accepts Charles Oliveira's BMF callout, says March is 'very possible' for lightweight showdown\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe ChampionIlia Topuria (17-0)Age: 28Latest results: 9-0 in UFCTopuria's demolition of Oliveira via first-round knockout in their June vacant title bout made the proud Georgian, who fights out of Spain, a two-division champion in the aftermath of Islam Makhachev's move up to welterweight. With consecutive knockouts of Alexander Volkanovski, Max Holloway and Oliveira in title bouts, Topuria stands firmly atop most pound-for-pound lists and has the brightest potential of all UFC fighters to become the promotion's next global phenomenon. It's that reason why Topuria is so heavily rumored to be kicking off the UFC's January debut on Paramount/CBS against Justin Gaethje to coincide with the kickoff of a new seven-year, $7.7 billion dollar broadcasting deal. The well-rounded Topuria has the most lethal boxing skills in all of MMA with one-punch power in both hands.\nTop ContendersArman Tsarukyan (22-3)Age: 29UFC ranking: No. 2Latest results: 4 straight wins (9-1 since 2019)Inactivity and a back injury that forced him to withdraw from UFC 311 in January (one day before his rematch with Makhachev) have been the only things keeping the Georgian native of Armenian descent from getting the title shot that he appeared to secure by edging Oliveira via split decision in his last fight at UFC 300 in 2024. A hulking figure with knockout power and a strong wrestling base, Tsarukyan will finally snap an 18-month layoff when he headlines a Nov. 22 Fight Night card in Qatar against Dan Hooker. Tsarukyan, who weighed in as the backup to the Topuria-Oliveira title fight in June, could cement his shot at next in line for the title with a win.Paddy Pimblett (23-3)Age: 30UFC ranking: No. 7Latest results: 7-0 in UFCFrom the standpoint of pure skill and enough quality wins to earn this distinction, Pimblett still falls short. But it's hard to ignore the marketing draw he brings out of the UK, not to mention his long-running rivalry with Topuria, which makes it possible that he fights next for the lightweight title. Pimblett's best wins have come against aging names like Tony Ferguson, King Green and Michael Chandler, the latter of whom he stopped in April (for Chandler's fifth defeat in six fights). \"Paddy the Baddy\" has shown plenty of improvement, however, after becoming the father of twins and taking his fitness between fights more seriously. He has looked of late as a far more serious fighter than he did back in 2022, when Pimblett won a decision over Jared Gordon that few thought he earned. Even if UFC chooses to pair Gaethje with Topuria in January, it wouldn't be impossible to consider a scenario where Pimblett sits out and waits for a spring shot against the winner. With a strong ground game and a flair for the dramatic, Pimblett remains a massive wild card amid the lightweight elite. \nStill in the Mix   Max Holloway (27-8)Age: 33UFC ranking: No. 3Latest results: Won 4 of 5 since 2022 trilogy loss to VolkanovskiThe former featherweight king and current BMF champion defended his symbolic title in July by outslugging Dustin Poirier in their trilogy at UFC 318. Holloway's last loss came at the hands of Topuria in their 2024 featherweight title bout, which could make it difficult for the future Hall of Famer to be prioritized for a rematch considering he was knocked out for the first time in his 15-year career. The good news for Holloway is that he seems to have stumbled into a fun stay-busy fight in the form of a rematch against Oliveira, this time for the BMF crown, which the native of Hawaii has shown interest in after being called out. Holloway said he would prefer the fight to happen in March, likely so he could recover in time for a possible June fight at the White House. The durable veteran has slowed down just enough to fall out of most P4P top 10 lists but is still considered an elite lightweight after knocking out Gaethje and retiring Poirier within the division over the past 18 months.\nCharles Oliveira (36-11, 1 NC)Age: 35UFC ranking: No. 4Latest results: 3-3 in last 6\nOne week ago, this would have been a very different conversation. On one hand, Oliveira's three losses over the past three years have come against elite foes (Makhachev, Tsarukyan, Topuria). On the other hand, he's 17 years into his pro career, a veteran of nearly 50 fights and was knocked out cold just four months ago. Oliveira's efficient statement in submitting the No. 8 Gamrot was a stark reminder, however, regarding how much of a threat he still is to the title on any given night. The UFC's all-time leader in fights, fight bonuses, submissions and finishes is also closing in on the record for wins. And it's also a good reminder that before he was stopped by Topuria, Oliveira was having success on his feet and in the clinches due to his size advantage. Dark HorsesJustin Gaethje (26-5)Age: 36UFC ranking: No. 5Latest results: Won 3 of last 4 This isn't meant as a slight against Gaethje, necessarily. In fact, if recent rumors are to be believed, the former interim lightweight titleholder could very well be next for Topuria's first title defense in January. But Gaethje, who turns 37 in November, has certainly seen better days as an elite force, even with a pair of victories over Rafael Fiziev since 2023. Should UFC choose Gaethje amid an already crowded group of big-name contenders, it would likely be because of his action style, the fact that he's an increasingly rare American UFC title contender and that his style could be perfect to catapult Topuria's growing star to a new legion of casual fans on Paramount/CBS. Although Gaethje will always hold a puncher's chance in any fight he takes part in, he would be a massive betting underdog against Topuria and has been stopped in title or BMF fights three times since 2020 (Khabib Nurmagomedov, Oliveira and Holloway).Dan HookerAge: 35UFC ranking: No. 6Latest results: Won 3 straightThe all-action native of New Zealand is undergoing a bit of a renaissance following a TKO of Claudio Puelles and back-to-back victories by split decision over Jalin Turner and Mateusz Gamrot. The win streak turned out to be a necessity for Hooker following a stretch in which he lost four of five bouts against elite foes. Should Hooker pull the upset against Tsarukyan in November, he very well could leap to the top of this list. Still, as a feast-or-famine brawler who has proven he can compete well at the elite level yet still lacks a truly elite win, Hooker remains an exciting long shot to wear the belt. \nBenoit Saint DenisAge: 29UFC ranking: No. 13Latest results: 2-2 in last 4 Don't count the \"God of War\" out just yet as it pertains to his lightweight title hopes. The hard-punching striker and former French Army Special Forces soldier has been on a rollercoaster of highs and lows in recent years. After losing his 2021 UFC debut, BSD ran off five consecutive wins, all by stoppage, and was considered the next big thing at 155 pounds. A pair of stoppage defeats followed, however, against Poirier (in a fight he took while sick) and Renato Moicano (stopped due to an eye injury). While the losses showcased Saint Denis' lack of defense, he appeared to take heed from the setbacks by bouncing back in 2025 with a pair of submission wins over Kyle Prepolec and Mauricio Ruffy (which saw BSD focus on his wrestling). Saint Denis is still young enough to put it all together and remains one of the most rugged and dangerous contenders in the top 15. \n            ",

The fans in Toronto already saw him on Oct. 24 when the Bucks won there,\" SportsLine NBA handicapper Matt Severance said. \"This just absolutely smells like a sit game -- first B2B of year for Milwaukee -- considering he's listed on every injury report anyways. And the Raptors, on normal rest after cashing for us Sunday, are not a bad team that might well take care of business regardless. Toronto is also likely to get starting center Jakob Poeltl back from a three-game injury absence.\" Back Toronto at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Duke -8.5 vs. Texas (-115)The Longhorns hired Sean Miller away from Xavier last year and he did well to compose an experienced roster for his first season, but Texas will be much better off when he has a full recruiting cycle under its belt. Meanwhile, Duke lost its top five scorers from last season's Final Four team to the NBA but Jon Scheyer reloaded with the No. 1 recruiting class in the country. Cameron Boozer and Nikolas Khamenia could both be lotto picks next year and Caleb Foster, Isaiah Evans and Maliq Brown were all key depth pieces last year. The model predicts that the Blue Devils cover in 59% of simulations. Back Duke at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Over 233.5 points in Warriors vs. Suns (-115)The Over has hit in five of seven games for both the Suns and Warriors so far this season, and if you drill down a little further, the Over has hit in all three of Phoenix's road games while Golden State is 2-1 to the Over at home. The Over has also hit in six of the last 10 head-to-head matchups between these two franchises. Al Horford (toe) and Dillon Brooks (groin) have both been ruled out already, taking a solid defender off the board for both teams. The model predicts that the Over hits in 62% of simulations, and this is one of its A-rated picks for Tuesday. Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

White (calf) remains out for the Bulls and Ayo Dosunmu (quad) is listed as questionable, so backcourt depth might be a concern. George (knee) has also been ruled out, but Joel Embiid should be fresh after being rested on Sunday against the Nets. The backcourt of Tyrese Maxey and V.J.

    "body": "\n        The Arizona Cardinals moved to 3-5 Monday night thanks to their 27-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Quarterback Jacoby Brissett was one of the stars of the game, as he thrashed the hapless Cowboys defense, completing 67.7% of his passes for 261 yards, two touchdowns. He rushed for another score.Brissett became the second player in Cardinals franchise history to pass for 250 yards, two touchdowns and rush for a touchdown on \"Monday Night Football,\" joining Jim Hart in 1974, according to CBS Sports Research. Brissett played well in the place of the injured Kyler Murray over the last three games. In fact, well enough to spark a quarterback controversy.Following the win in Dallas, reporters asked Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon if Murray was still his starting quarterback when he returns. \"Yeah, nothing's changed on that,\" Gannon said. \"That's how I feel.\" Reporters followed up by questioning if Brissett did well enough to earn deeper opportunity.\n\"I got nothing to add on that guys,\" Gannon said.After Murray suffered a foot injury in the Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Brissett elevated to starter. In the competitive 31-27 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, he threw for 320 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, followed by a 279-yard, two-touchdown performance in the 27-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 7. One could make the argument that Brissett has been the better quarterback.Cardinals QBs this seasonKyler MurrayJacoby BrissettYards per attempt6.07.7Total TDs77Turnovers42Passer rating88.6102.5The Cardinals' weaponry also benefitted from the change under center. Marvin Harrison Jr. caught a career-high seven passes for 96 yards and a touchdown against the Cowboys, while Trey McBride became just the third tight end in NFL history to catch five passes in 10 straight games, joining Travis Kelce and Tony Gonzalez. He caught four touchdowns in three games with Brissett starting, and just one touchdown in five games with Murray.\nGannon made it clear that Murray is his starting quarterback when healthy enough to return to the lineup. But how short is Murray's leash if the Cards' offense goes back to struggling? Arizona is on a short week, traveling to take on on the rival Seattle Seahawks this upcoming Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first trade of deadline day in the NFL is on the board. Naturally, it was Jerry Jones who got the party started, striking a deal with the Cincinnati Bengals for veteran linebacker Logan Wilson. Jones, Dallas' owner and general manager, revealed on Monday that his club had a deal in the works, but kept his cards close to the vest for the most part. Now, that deal has since been revealed, with Wilson heading to AT&T Stadium as Cincinnati lands a Day 3 pick in 2026. While the Bengals have arguably the worst defense in the NFL, Wilson being moved shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The linebacker had previously requested a trade out of Cincinnati after he saw his role decrease in 2025. Still, it is a rather seismic move for the Bengals as Wilson, a team captain, had been a key figure at linebacker, including during the team's run to Super Bowl LVI during the 2022 season. For Dallas, this is a move in hopes that it'll help turn the tide of what has been a poor first half of the season on defense, which includes allowing the Jacoby Brissett-led Cardinals to post 27 points in an upset win on Monday night.With this trade in the books, let's examine it even further and hand out our grades to see which club came out on top. The tradeCowboys get: LB Logan WilsonBengals get: 2026 seventh-round pickDallas Cowboys: B\nThe Dallas defense is in a bad way. Coming out of Week 9, the club is allowing 6.1 yards per play (third-highest in the NFL), 7.7 yards per pass attempt (third-highest), and 30.8 points per game (second-highest). That 30.8 points per game total is the most alarming, as no team in NFL history has made the playoffs allowing 30 or more per game, so Jerry Jones needed to make a move to improve the unit. \nWhile it may feel like a last-ditch effort with the club sitting at 3-5-1 on the year, Wilson does have the potential to help them pressure the quarterback. The veteran linebacker has the third-highest pass-rushing grade among linebackers this season, according to Pro Football Focus. Linebacker (Team)PFF pass rush gradeZack Baun (Eagles)90.1Kaden Elliss (Falcons)87.8Logan Wilson (Cowboys)87.2Mack Wilson Sr. (Cardinals)83.3Bobby Wagner83.2Giving yourself a puncher's chance to improve on defense and with hopes of pushing back into the playoff conversation is certainly worth giving up a 2026 seventh-rounder.Cincinnati Bengals: DMaybe the only defense worse than the Cowboys is Cincinnati. Whether it's yards per play allowed (6.4) or points per game allowed (33.3), the Bengals have the worst defense in the NFL by most measures, so seeing them lose a piece is hardly ideal. In their eyes, Wilson was a declining player as he fell out of the starting rotation and began playing more on special teams. That led to the veteran requesting a trade. When that happens, the return is never going to be outstanding for a player of his stature and point in his career. \nWith that in mind, Cincinnati was painted into a corner a bit in terms of what it could get for Wilson, but a 2026 seventh-rounder hardly moves the needle. It's essentially a coin flip if the player they take with that pick will even make the roster next summer, so no one should be falling out of their chairs with this deal from a Bengals standpoint. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.You know what's dumb? The scoring play that is defensive indifference. A quick explainer: Most of the time when a runner takes a base without a ball being put in play, it's a stolen base. He could advance via a passed ball, wild pitch or balk, too, but it's usually a stolen base. There are some scenarios where what looks like a steal, however, is not. Let's say a team is losing by three runs in the ninth and there are two outs with a runner on first base. The defense might decide to ignore the runner to the point that he just steals second without his attempt being contested. No step-off, no throw over, nothing. This is not called a stolen base but instead defensive indifference. And it drives me crazy. There are times that teams allow a run to score in order to get someone else out instead. Is that indifference? No, absolutely not. The run still counts. The defense wasn't indifferent to the runner on third base who came home to score. They prioritized. The run still counts! When the defense is so much more worried about positioning and focusing on the batter, they are prioritizing and allowing the runner to steal second, the same as when they allow a runner to score in order to record an out.\nI'm trying to understand why this even mattered in the first place when they decided to implement this rule. Was it a huge problem with some players padding their stolen base stats the handful of times per season when the specific situation happened? A bunch of people started calling the commissioner complaining that this player or that player had one too many stolen bases and it was an injustice? And then the commish decided this travesty just couldn't be allowed to continue? Are stolen base totals so sacred that we need the official scorer getting bogged down with deciding if the defense was trying hard enough to hold on the runner or not? This is lunacy, man. There's no need for any minutia here.\nIt's an easy fix, too. Take the official scorer's decision out of the equation. If a player steals a base, it's a stolen base. There's no need to get bogged down in details with whether or not the defense cared enough. It's time to remove \"defensive indifference\" from our working baseball statistical vocabulary. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Dak Prescott suffered a rolled ankle during the first half of Monday night's 27-17 loss to the Cardinals. Dallas' quarterback described the injury as minor and said that he will be fine for the Cowboys' Week 11 game against the Raiders. Prescott will have an additional week to heal up as the Cowboys are entering their bye week. Dallas goes into its bye with a 3-5-1 record following consecutive losses to the Broncos and Cardinals. Despite the recent losses, Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones clearly believes that his team is still capable of turning things around. He pulled off the first big move of NFL trade deadline day by acquiring linebacker Logan Wilson from the Bengals in exchange for a seventh-round pick. While Dallas' defense has struggled all year, its offensive line was equally bad on Monday night in terms of protecting Prescott. The 32-year-old was sacked five times, hit nine times and was pressured on 19 of his 39 drop backs. \nDespite the hits and his ankle issue, Prescott stayed in the game and willed the Cowboys' offense on a late scoring drive that culminated in his five-yard touchdown pass to wideout Ryan Flournoy. That was as close as the Cowboys got, however, as Dallas turned the ball over during its last two drives of the night. The dagger was Prescott's interception to Cardinals cornerback Denzel Burke with 1:29 remaining. While Monday wasn't his best night, Prescott has been arguably the biggest reason why the Cowboys -- at least in the eyes of Jones -- still have a puncher's chance at turning their season around. The 10-year veteran currently leads the NFL in pass attempts and is the front-runner to win Comeback Player of the Year after returning from last year's season-ending hamstring injury. \nWhile Prescott and the Cowboys' offense has largely been good, the defense's ongoing struggles have largely contributed to Dallas being in jeopardy of a second straight non-playoff season. The Cowboys are also in jeopardy of extending their drought without an NFC title game appearance. Dallas hasn't advanced that far since it captured its fifth and most recent Super Bowl title at the end of the 1995 season. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Lone Star State will take center stage for many with Week 11 college football picks as the two ranked matchups on the slate involving Texas teams. There's Texas Tech vs. BYU in the Big 12, which has the ninth-ranked Red Raiders favored by 10 points over the No. 8 Cougars, per the latest college football odds. Then over in the SEC, Texas A&M vs. Missouri sees the No. 3 Aggies as 7-point favorites over 19th-ranked Mizzou. There are, however, several other intriguing matchups to place Week 11 college football bets on.No. 4 Alabama vs. LSU (+10) is a classic rivalry as the Tigers play their first game in the post-Brian Kelly era. Auburn also moved on from its coach, Hugh Freeze, and it is a 6.5-point underdog to No. 15 Vanderbilt. Not to be overlooked, Notre Dame vs. Navy (+26.5) will see the teams play for the 98th time, and that game has one of the largest Week 11 college football spreads. Before locking in any Week 11 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to see the latest Week 11 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

OSU's 12-game win streak is the longest in the nation, and the defense has been utterly dominant in 2025. The Buckeyes' 6.9 points allowed are the fewest by any Big Ten team through the first eight games of a season in the last 40 years. Meanwhile, Purdue ranks 109th (out of 136 FBS teams) in scoring, as the Boilermakers have lost seven straight games. With Ryan Day boasting a 53-1 record versus unranked opponents -- including a +32.6 margin of victory -- the model has Ohio State covering well over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Clemson (-2.5, 55.5) covers versus Florida State in a 7 p.m. ET Saturday kickoff well over 50% of the time. The season hasn't gone according to plan for either team, but the Tigers are 2-2 ATS over their last four, while FSU is just 1-4 ATS over its last five. The Clemson defense has the ability to make Florida State one dimensional, as the Tigers have kept three of their last four opponents to 85 or fewer rushing yards. That could be a major issue for the Seminoles, especially considering QB Thomas Castellanos' road struggles. His team has outright lost in each of his last five away starts, and he has just a lone touchdown pass, versus two picks, on the road this year. The Under is projected to hit almost 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 11The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 11, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a Big Ten underdog outright winning. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which Big Ten favorite goes down?

    "body": "\nTottenham are back in their home stadium after a disappointing 1-0 home defeat against Chelsea over the weekend and hope to get back to winning in the Champions League after two draws in a row and one opening home win. To do so, Thomas Frank's side will have to win against Copenhagen on Tuesday with some players injured, as Spurs will miss Lucas Bergvall, who is ruled out through a concussion suffered in defeat to Chelsea, and other players such as Radu Dragusin, Dejan Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and James Maddison, all sidelined with injury. Here's what you need to know ahead of Tuesday's match in London: Viewing informationDate: Tuesday, Nov. 4 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium -- LondonLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Tottenham -299; Draw +421; Copenhagen +794What are Tottenham saying? Speaking to the media in the pre-match press conference, Frank discussed the issues his team faced in the home games in the first part of the season. \"I think there are different types of games. Sometimes, also because everything is accumulating or adding a little bit up, so the number you gain is not a fantastic number. We haven't won at home the last whatever games in the Premier League. Not too many. Completely different games. Some teams are very difficult to play against in that environment. Others are a little bit easier. Everything is difficult, but, for example, Villa, I think very good competitive performance. Unfortunately, we lost. It just went the wrong way. We could easily have won 1-0. I think Saturday night is an accumulation of a lot of things, a big London derby, always hope we can beat them, we haven't won against them for a long time and that's just added a bit.\"Possible lineupsTottenham XI: Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Rodrigo Bentancur, Joao Palhinha; Brennan Johnson, Xavi Simons, Wilson Odobert; Randal Kolo Muani.Copenaghen XI: Dominik Kotarski; Junnosuke Suzuki, Gabriel Pereira, Pantelis Hatzidiakos, Marcos Lopez; Jordan Larsson, Lukas Lerager, William Clem, Elias Achouri; Youssoufa Moukoko, Mohamed Elyounoussi.How to watchAll of the action on Matchday 3 of the UEFA Champions League can be caught on Paramount+, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have select simultaneous coverage.

Right now, only Inter are currently in the top eight of the Champions League league phase with three wins in three matches. However, if we compare the performances of the Serie A sides to the ones of the past season, things are not that different. In fact, at this stage last season, before the fourth matchday, the Nerazzurri were among the top eight teams with seven points from three matches, standing as the only Italian side in the tournament's upper tier. Looking below, things are not that different. Atalanta, despite the managerial change, find themselves in a similar position to last season, one point worse off, sitting 17th with four points from three games compared to five at the same stage last year. \n        \n            \n                UEFA Champions League Matchday 4 storylines, schedule, live stream: How to watch UCL on Paramount+\n                \n                    Pardeep Cattry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJuventus have performed noticeably worse than they did last season under Thiago Motta and are now preparing for their first match under new coach Luciano Spalletti against Sporting CP. The change comes after the dismissal of Igor Tudor, who replaced Motta last season, but managed to collect only two points from the opening three games. The Bianconeri are currently sitting in 25th place, outside of the playoff spots compared to the six points they had last year at this point of the competition. And then we have Napoli, currently sitting in 23rd place with three points. Antonio Conte's team need to improve their results in the coming weeks if they want to at least qualify for the playoffs. Compared to last season, the first under the new Champions League format, there are only four Italian Serie A teams participating this year, whereas last season there were five, thanks to the strong performances of Italian clubs in the previous campaign. Despite reaching the Champions League final last season with Inter, Italian teams were not able to retain the fifth spot for the current season and as of today thing are not looking great for the coming year, also looking at the other teams involved in the Europa and Conference League. Let's take a look at the current UEFA Country Coefficients, knowing that only the first two spots will be granted of an additional spot in the next Champions League: RankCountryCoefficient1England (ENG)8.166 2Portugal (POR)7.600 3Poland (POL)7.375 4Germany (GER)7.285 5Spain (ESP)7.250 6Cyprus (CYP)7.2507Denmark (DEN)7.1258Italy (ITA)6.857 It's too early to tell whether Italian clubs will be able to secure an additional Champions League spot for next season, but they'll certainly need to improve their results to make it possible. Fiorentina have been the best one so far, winning both of their Conference League games, while Bologna and AS Roma have struggled to find consistency. Gian Piero Gasperini's side have only managed one win and two defeats, and Bologna currently sit on four points after three matches. They all need to improve before it will be too late and the upcoming week of European soccer will tell us more. \nMatchday 4 TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternTUESDAY, NOV. 4TIMEHOW TO WATCHChampions League Matchday12 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkNapoli vs. Eintracht Frankfurt12:45 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkSlavia Praha vs. Arsenal12:45 p.m.Paramount+UEFA Champions League Today pre-match2 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkChampions League Matchday2:45 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkThe Golazo Show3 p.m.Paramount+Atletico Madrid vs. Union Saint-Gilloise3 p.m.Paramount+Liverpool vs. Real Madrid3 p.m.Paramount+Tottenham Hotspur vs. Copenhagen3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkOlympiacos vs. PSV3 p.m.Paramount+Juventus vs. Sporting Lisbon3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkParis Saint-Germain vs. Bayern Munich3 p.m.Paramount+Bodo/Glimt vs. Monaco3 p.m.Paramount+UEFA Champions League Today post-match5 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkThe Champions Club5 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo Network, YouTubeScoreline7 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkWEDNESDAY, NOV. 5TIMEHOW TO WATCHChampions League Matchday12 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkPafos vs. Villarreal12:45 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkQarabag vs. Chelsea12:45 p.m.Paramount+UEFA Champions League Today pre-match2 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkChampions League Matchday2:45 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkThe Golazo Show3 p.m.Paramount+Manchester City vs. Borussia Dortmund3 p.m.Paramount+Newcastle United vs. Athletic Club3 p.m.Paramount+Ajax vs. Galatasaray3 p.m.Paramount+Club Brugge vs. Barcelona3 p.m.Paramount+Benfica vs. Bayer Leverkusen3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkInter vs. Kairat3 p.m.Paramount+Marseille vs. Atalanta3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkUEFA Champions League Today post-match5 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkThe Champions Club5 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo Network, YouTubeScoreline7 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo Network\n            \n\n        \n                        ",

The 6-foot-8 forward certainly looked the part in Monday's season-opener. He took 18 shots, made 11 of them and finished with 30 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals in Arizona's 93-87 victory over Florida, and he generally looked like the best frontcourt player on the court even though Todd Golden's Gators, the reigning national champions, arguably have the best frontcourt in the sport, one featuring AP Preseason First Team All-American Alex Condon,a 6-11 junior who was physically dominated by the 18 year-old pretty much from start to finish in a game played inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\"Koa, it was a coming out party for him, so to speak,\" said Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd. \"Everyone's known about him, but no one's really studied him and watched him. He's a special player. The way he came out in that atmosphere, and he went against a first team All-American, and that kid's a heck of a player, and Koa obviously more than held his own.\"Peat definitely more than held his own.\nHe dominated.And now Arizona is up to No. 6 in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where St. John's remains No. 1 following its 108-74 season-opening win over Quinnipiac. Florida dropped to No. 7. Those developments caused Texas Tech, Michigan, Duke and UCLA to be pushed down one spot each, no fault of their own.Arizona's next game is Friday against Utah Tech. The Wildcats' next game against another currently ranked opponent is Nov. 14 against UCLA.\nItching for more college hoops analysis?

    "body": "\n        As the 2025-26 coaching carousel moves with dizzying speed, a looming reality approaches teams who made head coaching changes like a hidden iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. The transfer portal is coming. Schools that underwent coaching changes have more of an opportunity to keep their best players than in years past due to a rule change that prevents players from entering the portal until five days after a new coach is hired -- previously players were granted a 30-day window to enter immediately after a coaching change. But it will still be a difficult task for a new head coach to convince his best assets to stay in what's expected to be a robust transfer market.  And no player on a team that made a head coaching change this year would have more suitors than Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman. The \"other\" five-star receiver in the top five of the 2024 class alongside Jeremiah Smith, Coleman is everything you want in a big-play threat. He's 6-foot-3, 201 pounds, runs a sub 4.5-second 40, has the leaping ability of a slam-dunk champion and is laterally quick enough to post a sub 4.2-second short shuttle. \nHe's flashed that ability when given the chance on The Plains. He's caught 74 passes for 1,072 yards and 11 touchdowns as an underclassman, excelling despite sub-par quarterback play.Keeping the Phenix City, Alabama native on the roster should be priority No. 1 for whoever takes over as Auburn's next head coach. But they might encounter a difficult sell. Yes, Auburn is 45 minutes from home. But Coleman is entering his money year. He's in the same talent ballpark as fellow 2024 class receivers Smith and Ryan Williams. He could be drafted with them. But he needs to put together a strong year of tape as a junior to solidify that positioning, and the surest way to do is to pair with an elite, proven quarterback. \n\"The junior season is huge,\" a source said of Coleman. \"He needs productivity.\" Maybe Auburn's next coach can convince Coleman of a plan to put him on that first-round path. It'd require a great offensive coach, or at least a great coordinator, and a specific target at quarterback in the portal given the answer at QB does not lie on Auburn's roster. But that's a lot of ifs, and a few industry sources consider it far more likely that Coleman takes the cleaner path and explores the portal. He'd have his pick of any play-caller/coach situation he'd want upon entry. \nA lot of Coleman's runner-up high school options, like Clemson and LSU, are in unsteady positions. But the former Texas A&M commit has a strong connection with now Aggies wide receiver coach Holmon Wiggins, who recruited him while at Alabama.\nColeman could reconsider the Tide and play opposite Williams. Texas is looking for an elite wide receiver for Arch Manning ahead of his redshirt junior year. Michigan could use some help for Bryce Underwood. One industry source even speculated that Coleman could play with Smith at Ohio State if Carnell Tate leaves for the NFL or pair up with DJ Lagway and Dallas Wilson at Florida. Oregon, Ole Miss, Georgia, Notre Dame and every other contender would be happy to pay Coleman, too. It's worth noting that Coleman is represented by NFL power agent David Mulugheta of Athlete's First, who will easily and aggressively navigate the market. The truly elite receivers in college football push past $2 million a year. Coleman, even with inconsistent production, could command that type of sum. \nThere's still a lot of time between now and December. Whoever Auburn hires will make an aggressive push to keep Coleman. He's the type of player who could set the foundation and raise the ceiling for whoever comes next at Auburn. Money certainly won't be a factor for the Tigers as they try to keep Coleman home. But in an era where the truly elite players of the sport transfer with infrequency – only one first-team all-conference Power Four player transferred during the 2024-25 portal cycle – Coleman is the type of talent who could change the outlook of the 2026 playoff race if he were to switch teams. College football is watching the coaching search play out at Auburn for now. But not too long after that is resolved, the eyes of the sport will turn toward Coleman and his should-I-stay-or-should-I-go decision. \n            ",

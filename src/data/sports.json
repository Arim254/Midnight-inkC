    "body": "\n        There were a few upsets across the NFL Sunday, including the New York Jets pulling off a last-minute comeback to secure their first win of the season. The Miami Dolphins were able to come together for a much-needed victory as well, which cost them position in the 2026 NFL Draft order. There is a new team at No. 1 overall this week. As a reminder, there are three teams without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft day trades, plus the Micah Parsons deal: Atlanta, Green Bay and Jacksonville. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order, per Tankathon, as well as potential team needs:1. New Orleans Saints (1-7)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans struggled to get anything going on offense against Tampa Bay and the team made the decision to install Tyler Shough as the new starting quarterback. \n2. New York Jets (1-7)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TENew York got its first win of the season as Justin Fields led the franchise to a comeback victory over the Bengals. It was a particularly strong performance on the ground for the Jets. 3. Tennessee Titans (1-7)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEThe Titans continue to struggle on both sides of the ball as Indianapolis delivered a decisive blow Sunday.4. Cleveland Browns (2-6)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLEdge rusher Myles Garrett produced five sacks and a forced fumble. Cleveland played New England close for one half, but the Patriots eventually pulled away from Dillon Gabriel and the Browns. \n5. Miami Dolphins (2-6)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SThe vibes were bad in Miami after last weekend's loss to Cleveland in blustery conditions. Coach Mike McDaniel was able to rally the troops for a definitive victory over the Falcons. 6. New York Giants (2-6)Projected needs: IOL, OT, DL, CB, LBNew York was unable to pull off the regular-season sweep of the rival Eagles. The loss was even more costly as running back Cam Skattebo was lost for the season with an ankle injury. 7. Baltimore Ravens (2-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBPro Bowl quarterback Tyler Huntley led Baltimore to a much-needed victory over Chicago in the absence of Lamar Jackson. The Ravens have an opportunity to gain ground in the AFC North. \n8. Las Vegas Raiders (2-5)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTThe Raiders were on a bye this week after dropping last week's contest. 9. Arizona Cardinals (2-5)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBArizona was able to use its bye week to sulk over last weekend's loss to the Packers. Coach Jonathan Gannon attempts to rally the troops in time for next week's Monday night game against the Cowboys.10. Cincinnati Bengals (3-5)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Flacco provided Cincinnati with competent play at the game's most important position once again. He threw for over 200 yards and two touchdowns, but the defense was unable to stop the Jets when it needed it most. 11. Washington Commanders (3-5)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRAnother loss for the Commanders without Jayden Daniels. It's getting late early for last season's playoff darlings.\n12. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (3-4)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta's loss to Miami was Los Angeles' gain. The Rams possess the Falcons' first-round pick after a draft night trade in April. 13. Minnesota Vikings (3-4)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBThe curtain may have dropped on Carson Wentz on Thursday night. Minnesota was nowhere near competitive as Max Brosmer was inserted into the lineup late. 14. Houston Texans (3-4)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SHouston has not had the season it had envisioned, but Sunday was a bright spot as the Texans overcame one of the league's best teams: San Francisco. \n15. Dallas Cowboys (3-4-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas is a difficult team to pinpoint this year. The Cowboys are capable of outscoring teams, but the defense is not stopping much of anything. The Cowboys were nearly doubled up Sunday by the Broncos. 16. Carolina Panthers (4-4)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina's three-game win streak ended Sunday against Buffalo. The Panthers were a complete no-show without Bryce Young. 17. Chicago Bears (4-3)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTChicago's win streak draws to a close as the Ravens pulled away Sunday. The Bears remain above .500 and alive in the NFC playoff hunt. \n18. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (4-3)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville was on its bye after losing to the Rams in London last weekend. The Browns retain the rights to the Jaguars' first-round pick, following a draft day trade for Travis Hunter Jr. 19. Pittsburgh Steelers (4-3)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLThe Steelers lost the much-anticipated prime-time game against the Packers as Aaron Rodgers couldn't beat his former team.  20. San Francisco 49ers (5-3)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TEInjuries continue to mount for San Francisco. The 49ers finally faltered against Houston on Sunday.\n21. Los Angeles Chargers (5-3)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLThe Chargers crushed Minnesota on Thursday night. Justin Herbert threw for three touchdowns and Los Angeles' defense limited the Vikings to 10 points. 22. Kansas City Chiefs (5-3)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEThe Chiefs were locked in a 7-7 tie at halftime on Monday night before Patrick Mahomes' flawless second half led them to a 28-7 victory.23. Los Angeles Rams (5-2)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLThe Rams were on a bye this week after toppling Jacksonville in London a week ago. \n24. Detroit Lions (5-2)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit was on a bye this week. The Lions return next week against Minnesota. 25. Buffalo Bills (5-2)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRBuffalo, coming off its bye week, demolished Carolina. First-round cornerback selection Maxwell Hairston had a tackle in his professional debut. 26. Seattle Seahawks (5-2)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRSeattle is yet another team on a laundry list of bye teams this week. 27. Denver Broncos (6-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTDallas gave up big play after big play as the Broncos ran away in a romp. Wide receiver Troy Franklin (two) and running back RJ Harvey (three) combined for five scores.28. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-2)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TETampa Bay stifled the New Orleans offense to the point that second-round pick Tyler Shough replaced Spencer Rattler. \n29. New England Patriots (6-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGENew England and Cleveland played a tight game in the first half, but the Drake Maye hype train rolled as the Patriots pulled away in the second half. 30. Philadelphia Eagles (6-2)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia avoided a regular-season sweep at the hand of the Giants. Jalen Hurts threw for four touchdowns. 31. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (5-1-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas has the rights to Green Bay's first-round pick as a result of the Micah Parsons trade. 32. Indianapolis Colts (7-1)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLIndianapolis' magical season continues as the Colts put divisional foe Tennessee in its place. The Colts have scored 25+ points in each of their seven victories this season. The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

The Week 8 slate certainly had some pivotal games that impacted playoff races.The New York Jets likely took the Cincinnati Bengals out of the AFC North hunt with their upset win. The Dallas Cowboys' playoff chances took a massive hit with their loss to the Denver Broncos, while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers appear to be cruising toward their fifth straight NFC South title. The Indianapolis Colts have the best record in football and are atop the AFC, while the Green Bay Packers maintained their No. 1 spot in the NFC thanks to their big win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night. The Kansas City Chiefs are also in the playoff picture after their win over the Washington Commanders on Monday night.Below is a breakdown of the seven teams that are currently in the playoffs after Week 8. In addition to the seven playoff teams, let's look at their schedules and predict if they'll get in the playoffs or not -- along with the contenders for a playoff spot. \nAFC playoff pictureSeedTeamWLTPCT1Colts710 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.8752Patriots620 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7503Broncos620 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7504Steelers430 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.5715Bills520.7146Chargers530.6257Chiefs530.6251. Indianapolis Colts (7-1)Remaining schedule: at Steelers, vs. Falcons, Bye, at Chiefs, vs. Texans, at Jaguars, at Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, at TexansThe Colts are two games up in the loss column in the AFC South standings, which is their division to lose. Not only should Indianapolis have a playoff spot come January, but the Colts are a contender for home-field advantage. They also have wins over the Broncos, Rams and Chargers -- all teams with winning records. 2. New England Patriots (6-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Falcons, at Buccaneers, vs. Jets, at Bengals, vs. Giants, Bye, vs. Bills, at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots still have the lead over the Bills in the AFC East via the head-to-head tiebreaker and have taken advantage of a light schedule, which included Sunday's win over the Browns. New England should challenge Buffalo for the division, with a favorable schedule until the bye week. At worst, the Patriots are a wild card based on how they're playing. 3. Denver Broncos (6-2)Remaining schedule: at Texans, vs. Raiders, vs. Chiefs, Bye, at Commanders, at Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersA dominant victory over the Cowboys solidifies the Broncos as contenders for the AFC West, as the division leaders will be in the mix all year. The schedule gets a little easier over the next month, but the Broncos still have to play the Chiefs twice. Denver is making its case for a return trip to the playoffs.  4. Pittsburgh Steelers (4-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Colts, at Chargers, vs. Bengals, at Bears, vs. Bills, at Ravens, vs. Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers are trying to fall back to the field in the AFC North with two straight losses, but the Bengals helped by falling to the Jets. The schedule does get significantly tougher, and the Steelers play the Ravens twice. Pittsburgh leads the division by two games in the loss column, a sign how poor the AFC North is. 5. Buffalo Bills (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Chiefs, at Dolphins, vs. Buccaneers, at Texans, at Steelers, vs. Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsThe Bills got on the right track with a blowout win over the Panthers on Sunday, keeping pace with the Patriots in the AFC East. A win over the Chiefs in Week 9 will catapult the Bills' season, as significant playoff implications for both teams are at stake. 6. Los Angeles Chargers (5-3)Remaining schedule: at Titans, vs. Steelers, at Jaguars, Bye, vs. Raiders, vs. Eagles, at Chiefs, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers had a convincing win over the Vikings on Thursday to get back on track, showcasing they are still in the AFC West race. Wins over the Chiefs and Broncos do help the Chargers in the division race, and are the early tiebreakers they can sit on. Los Angeles can make a run in November with two AFC South teams on the schedule. 7. Kansas City Chiefs (5-3)Remaining schedule: at Bills, Bye, at Broncos, vs. Colts, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, vs. Chargers, at Titans, vs. Broncos, at RaidersA win over the Commanders on Monday night allowed the Chiefs to leapfrog the Jaguars (4-3) for the No. 7 seed in the AFC. Kansas City is a game out of the AFC West race, with a loss to Los Angeles in hand. The Chiefs have won five of six and appear destined to make another Super Bowl run.Who's in and who's out?The Chiefs (5-3) appear primed to take a playoff spot, but Los Angeles and Denver deserve a lot of credit for holding serve and winning this week as well. Three AFC West teams look likely to make the playoffs. The Patriots and Bills are still battling it out for the AFC East, and both of those teams should make the playoffs. The Ravens (2-5) had a big win over the Bears to stay alive in the AFC North race, especially with the Steelers falling to the Packers in Week 8. The Steelers still have a commanding lead in the division, but the Ravens are getting Lamar Jackson back and Pittsburgh has to play Baltimore twice. The Bengals (3-5) took a massive hit for their division chances by losing to the Jets. The Colts have control of the AFC South, but the Texans (3-4) are lurking for a playoff spot as the No. 9 seed. Jacksonville (4-3) still have a shot at the wild card. There is a playoff spot up for grabs in the AFC, but it appears the AFC West is getting three teams in. Houston would likely have to win the AFC South to get in, but Denver and Los Angeles are on the schedule (Broncos next week). Here are the early predictions for the AFC playoff teams though the Sunday slate of games in Week 8:Colts (AFC North)Chiefs (AFC West)Bills (AFC East)Steelers (AFC North)Patriots (wild card)Broncos (wild card)Chargers (wild card)  NFC playoff picture    RankTeamWLTPCT1Packers511.7862Eagles620.7503Buccaneers620.7504Seahawks520 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7145Lions520.7146Rams520.714749ers530.6251. Green Bay Packers (5-1-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Panthers, vs. Eagles, at Giants, vs. Vikings, at Lions, vs. Bears, at Broncos, at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsThe Packers took care of business against the Steelers in a matchup of division leaders, holding onto the No. 1 seed. The Eagles aren't going anywhere in the NFC, so the Week 10 matchup could be for the top seed in the conference when all is said and done. Green Bay has a pretty easy schedule after Philadelphia. 2. Philadelphia Eagles (6-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, at Packers, vs. Lions, at Cowboys, vs. Bears, at Chargers, vs. Raiders, at Commanders, at Bills, vs. CommandersThe Eagles go into their bye week with a two-game lead over the Cowboys in the loss column with a head-to-head victory in hand. They have control of the NFC East, but the Week 10 matchup with the Packers and Week 11 showdown with the Lions loom large for home-field advantage. 3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, vs. Patriots, at Bills, at Rams, vs. Cardinals, vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersThe Buccaneers are in control in the NFC South, and gained a bigger lead with everyone else in the division falling in Week 8.  A loss to the Eagles hurts home-field advantage chances, but the Buccaneers do have an easy schedule after back-to-back games against the Patriots and Bills.4. Seattle Seahawks (5-2)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, vs. Cardinals, at Rams, at Titans, vs. Vikings, at Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersThe Seahawks had their bye week and took over the division lead with the 49ers falling to the Texans. Two games against the Rams and a rematch with the 49ers will be fun, as the NFC West is a brutal division. Three teams from the NFC West may make the playoffs. 5. Detroit Lions (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Vikings, at Commanders, at Eagles, vs. Giants, vs. Packers, vs. Cowboys, at Rams, vs. Steelers, at Vikings, at BearsThe Lions retain the No. 5 seed with the Packers winning while they are on their bye. Detroit has losses to Green Bay and Kansas City, but the Lions are one of the more talented teams in the NFL. Their schedule looked rough on paper a week ago, but it got a bit easier. 6. Los Angeles Rams (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Saints, at 49ers, vs. Seahawks, vs. Buccaneers, at Panthers, at Cardinals, vs. Lions, at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsA tough schedule in November could decide the NFC West, but the Rams are right in the mix for the division. Los Angeles remains the No. 6 seed as it was idle this week. The Rams should have a wild card spot (at least) if Matthew Stafford stays healthy, as Los Angeles is a Super Bowl contender in the NFC. 7. San Francisco 49ers (5-3)Remaining schedule: at Giants, vs. Rams, at Cardinals, vs. Panthers, at Browns, Bye, vs. Titans, at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe 49ers have sustained injury after injury, and the injuries may have caught up with them after a Week 8 loss to the Texans. San Francisco lost the NFC West lead and fell to third in the division with that loss. The schedule is still very favorable, and the 49ers are 3-0 in the NFC West already. This is a still a playoff team, as no one outside the playoff picture seems to want a playoff spot. Who's in and who's out?The Packers remain in control of the NFC North, but Detroit is still within striking distance. This division may be settled by Thanksgiving, when Detroit faces Green Bay in the rematch. Both teams are in the playoffs regardless. Chicago (4-3) is also in the running for a playoff spot, currently possessing the No. 8 seed (half game out of the playoffs).The Buccaneers have full control of the NFC South. They'll win the division. The Eagles have control of the NFC East, but have back-to-back games against the Packers and Lions off the bye. A split would be massive for Philadelphia. The Commanders (3-5) and Cowboys (3-4-1) continue to lose ground on a wild card spot in a loaded NFC. \nThe NFC West is loaded, as two teams (Seahawks, Rams) are 5-2 through eight weeks. The 49ers are right there at 5-3, currently occupying the last playoff spot. The NFC North and NFC West could cancel each other out in the playoff race, as the NFC West matchups could involve some playoff reshuffling. Even though the Bears lost this week, don't count them out. The seven teams in right now? They may be the seven teams in come January, but Chicago is trying to crash the party. Here are the early predictions for the NFC playoff teams though the Sunday games in Week 8:\nEagles (NFC East)Lions (NFC North)Buccaneers (NFC South)Rams (NFC West)Packers (wild card)49ers (wild card)Seahawks (wild card)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Toronto Blue Jays star George Springer exited Monday night's World Series Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers after suffering an apparent side injury. Springer, who was replaced by veteran infielder Ty France, was also forced out of a game during the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners when he was hit on the right knee by an errant pitch from right-hander Bryan Woo. Springer, 36, called for the training staff after taking a first-pitch swing to open the top of the seventh. He grabbed at his right side, and while there's not word yet on what injury he suffered, that tends to be the universal sign of an oblique or intercoastal strain. Here's a look at the play in question:\nSpringer entered Game 3 hitting .259/.339/.593 with four home runs and nine runs batted in over the course of his first 13 postseason games this month. \nSpringer had been one of the main talking points entering Game 3, with reporters asking manager John Schneider (among others) about how Dodger Stadium's crowd was likely to receive him. Keep in mind, the Dodgers felt wronged by Springer for his employment by the Houston Astros during their sign-stealing scandal. \"I know he's prepared for it. He's been dealing with that for a long time,\" ,\" Schneider said Monday. \"It kind of is what it is. I think me, the manager in me, I probably get more mad than he does because you always have this like protective mode of your players.\n\"But I don't think it can galvanize a team, I don't think that it will directly affect what anyone is doing, and I don't think it's going to affect anything George is doing. George is arguably one of the best World Series performers in the history of the game. So I think that fans, they show their opinion or emotion, that's fine.

    "body": "\n        When Brian Kelly arrived Sunday morning, intent on making staff changes to try to fix an LSU season quickly going off the rails, he could not get into LSU's football facility. His thumbprint to get into the LSU Football Operations Center didn't work, sources told CBS Sports. It took a couple minutes and some help before Kelly finally got in and was able to get up to his office, where the trouble continued. When it was shared Sunday morning, the fingerprint snafu felt like a funny anecdote just hours after a disastrous 64th birthday for Kelly, whose LSU Tigers had been crushed at home, 49-25, by No. 3 Texas A&M. It was reminiscent of the famous clip of former LSU Tiger Jamal Adams being unable to get into the New York Jets' football building and immediately thinking he might have gotten cut. But for all its humor, that moment did capture something real about Kelly's LSU tenure: From the day he arrived, he never seemed to fully belong. By Sunday night, Kelly again needed help getting buzzed into the football facility. This time there was intent behind it. He had already been informed of his firing after four seasons as LSU's head coach. \nA hire once celebrated as a home run for LSU AD Scott Woodward now ends in the second-largest buyout in college football history ($53.8 million), though negotiations are ongoing to lower that total number. ***Why didn't it work for Kelly at LSU?You'll hear the word fit -- or lack thereof -- thrown around a lot in hindsight of LSU's decision to fire Kelly. From the early weird pronunciation of \"family\" mishap to calling out LSU fans for being spoiled, Kelly never seemed to understand how to authentically connect with the LSU fanbase. It always felt like a politician trying too hard to be something he wasn't. LSU is one of the best jobs in college football because of how much the state of Louisiana adores their Tigers. There's no other Power Four team in the state to divide attention and loyalty the way there is in neighboring states Alabama and Mississippi. There's a reason why the three coaches who preceded Kelly all won national championships in Baton Rouge. When everyone is pulling in the same direction, that's what's possible at LSU.But there's a laundry list of reasons Kelly never seemed to be the right guy for LSU despite his strong coaching credentials, which included a title game appearance while at Notre Dame. \nHe quickly fired beloved strength and conditioning coach Tommy Moffitt, a man all three of those title-winning coaches completely trusted to make LSU into a tough, physical team. You saw that Saturday night when Moffitt, now at Texas A&M, was on the sideline of the tougher, better team. Getting rid of defensive assistants Blake Baker and Corey Raymond, only to panic after Year 1 and bring them both back at significantly higher salaries, led to questions about Kelly's overall plan. He was hesitant to embrace NIL and two offseason ago whined about not wanting to spend up to land top players as his rivals happily did and were successful doing so. But what mattered most of all was that Kelly is significantly different than the three men who preceded him -- Nick Saban, Les Miles and Ed Orgeron -- in one important area: He is not obsessed with recruiting. Kelly took more of a CEO approach and delegated a lot of those responsibilities to assistant coaches and staffers. It worked for him at Notre Dame and the results in the Bayou weren't bad on paper -- he was still signing top 10 classes at LSU -- but there were grumbles that Kelly didn't seem to care so much about the lifeblood to winning in the SEC. There were questions about whether he was prioritizing the right kind of recruits. It wasn't until after LSU hired Austin Thomas away from Ole Miss as senior associate AD for football administration that there seemed to be a shift in the right direction. \"What they've done from a high school standpoint, what they've done from a hiring standpoint, what they've done from a portal standpoint, it's been up to the standard that every LSU fan would expect,\" an industry source told CBS Sports before the season started. \"And in the three years before that with Brian Kelly, it was not.\" \nFor as much attention as Hugh Freeze has gotten for his love of golf, insiders believe Kelly was on the golf course even more. Repeatedly over his time in Baton Rouge, sources questioned his time commitment and the frequency in which Kelly was out of the office. \"The players see he's not bought in,\" one source told CBS Sports last year. When everything is going well, those things don't matter. Winning cures everything, after all. But it's those little things that can stick in people's minds when expectations aren't met. Kelly was fired Sunday, but he had been building the case for his own dismissal for years.His public comments over the years did nothing to tamp down expectations he ultimately couldn't come close to meeting. \nAfter beating Oklahoma to finish the 2024 regular season 8-4, Kelly said \"We're taking receipts … and we'll see you at the national championship.\" He said at SEC spring meetings in May, \"This is the best roster we've put together.\" And yet it didn't take long to realize LSU had major holes on the roster, especially on the offensive line, that would prove problematic for the Tigers' preseason playoff hopes. When Kelly had a Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback (Jayden Daniels), the defense was disastrous and held the Tigers back. LSU finally invested in defense the last portal cycle and that largely paid off -- while the offense slipped to its worst marks since the 2000s. \nKelly is the second head coach fired this season whose team started the year in the AP preseason top 10.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            There was success along the way, including a win over Alabama and SEC Championship appearance his first season in 2022, followed by Daniels' Heisman season in 2023, but Kelly was always, quite fairly, held to the expectation of competing for national championships. No matter what Kelly did, he couldn't seem to press the right buttons. And all along the way, that supreme confidence of his -- what detractors describe as arrogance -- rubbed people the wrong way, including some important LSU supporters and decision-makers, according to sources. That fiery persona may been part of his downfall in a Sunday meeting with Woodward, which went horribly. Kelly left the facility shortly thereafter, a sign to his staff a total overhaul may be afoot.What was expected to be a change on the offensive staff became LSU deciding it'd rather just reset and find a new man to lead the program.\n***Everyone knew this was a critical year for Kelly, but he didn't lead any of those hot seat rankings at the beginning of the season because of the internal support he still seemed to possess. Some even liked LSU as a title pick after securing the nation's top-rated transfer portal class in addition to returning one of the SEC's top quarterbacks in Garrett Nussmeier. But just like James Franklin learned at Penn State: When you go all-in on a season with a heavy influx of NIL and revenue share money and still flop short of expectations, your downfall is accelerated. It started good enough. An impressive Week 1 road win over then-top five Clemson raised expectations that LSU was on the right path. It later proved to be a mirage. A loss to Ole Miss on Sept. 27 was discouraging but not backbreaking. That came three weeks later in Nashville when Kelly's former defensive coordinator at Notre Dame, Clark Lea, got the better of him.\"None of this mattered until they lost to Vanderbilt,\" one LSU source said. \"That's it. That's your tipping point.\"\nThe loss to No. 9 Vanderbilt, in which the Tigers managed only 100 rushing yards, was when the dam began to break. It certainly increased the likelihood that Kelly would make staff changes, starting with offensive coordinator Joe Sloan, who was ultimately fired Monday a day after Kelly. A week later, Texas A&M dominated LSU as loud \"Fire Kelly\" chants rang out inside Tiger Stadium. It prompted boosters to start rallying support to pay Kelly's massive buyout. With no permanent university president, it created a unique circumstance that ultimately involved Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry. A day that started with Kelly struggling to get into his office ended with him walking out for the last time.Kelly's time at LSU did not end in the national championship he had promised.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            After making the firing official, Woodward said in a statement that LSU would immediately begin a national coaching search for its next hire. There are already plenty of names making the rounds from Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin to Notre Dame's Marcus Freeman to Tulane's Jon Sumrall to even former Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher, who Woodward hired at A&M and later tried to hire at LSU in 2021 before landing on Kelly. \nAt the end of that statement there was a line that some believe sums up the entire saga. Woodward said he was confident LSU would bring in an outstanding coach \"who fits our culture and community and embraces the excellence we demand.\" It was a bar, insiders say, Kelly could not come close to clearing in Baton Rouge. \n            ",

In addition to leading the Penguins to their fifth win in their last six games, Crosby made NHL history by becoming the ninth player to register 1,700 career points and is the fourth-fastest player to reach that number. Only Wayne Gretzky, fellow Penguins icon Mario Lemieux and Marcel Dionne tallied 1,700 points in fewer games than Crosby, who reached that milestone in his 1,362nd game. Crosby surpassed another Penguins great Jaromir Jagr, who recorded his 1,700th career point in his 1,408th game. Crosby, who is also only the fourth player to score 1,700 points with one team, tallied three points during Monday's 6-3 win over the St. Louis Blues. He had two assists before getting scoring his seventh goal of the season early in the third period. \nThe 38-year-old also made franchise history by surpassing Lemieux for the most multi-point games in franchise history. Monday was the 498th multi-point game of Crosby's decorated career. \nCrosby isn't the only Penguins veteran who is enjoying a strong start to the 2025-26 season. Evgeni Malkin, who recently made history with Crosby and defenseman Kris Letang by becoming the longest-tenured teammates in American sports history, currently leads the NHL with 13 assists and is tied for the league lead with 16 points. The 39-year-old Malkin had a goal and an assist on Monday as the Penguins improved to 7-2-1. \nMalkin and Crosby have been two reasons for the Penguins' surprising success this season. Led by first year head coach Dan Muse, Pittsburgh is off to its best 10-game start since the 2014-15 season. The Penguins are ultimately hoping to make the playoffs for the first time since the 2021-22 campaign. \n            \n    ",

Surtain is believed to be week-to-week, but the Broncos have not lost their best defensive player for the season.In his reporting, Rapoport noted that Surtain could land on IR, meaning he would have to miss at least four games. Still, the Broncos are likely breathing a sigh of relief after seeing Surtain go down the tunnel Sunday.Surtain got banged up earlier in the game, when he camp up limp after defending Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens on an end zone target. Pickens was able to reenter the game and continued to play until suffering the pec injury.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 grades: Chiefs earn 'A-' for Monday night win; Cowboys get 'F' for blowout loss to Broncos\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 2024 Defensive Player of the Year, Surtain is one of the NFL's elite cornerbacks. Through eight games this season, Surtain has tallied 27 tackles and nine pass break-ups. Going into Week 8, Surtain was only allowing a 48.5% completion rate, which ranked seventh among qualified players.The Broncos selected Surtain with the No. 9 overall pick in 2021, and he's more than lived up to the expectations of a top-10 pick. Surtain has become a shutdown defender in Denver's secondary, and he's earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2022 and 2024.\nWith Surtain out for a while, the Broncos will turn to Riley Moss and rookie Jahdae Barron, the No. 20 overall pick in 2025. Their first test without Surtain in the lineup will come this weekend against C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        After passing on the chance to join them this summer, Marquez Valdes-Scantling is now planning to sign with the Steelers while reuniting with quarterback Aaron Rodgers, according to NFL Media. The 31-year-old receiver worked out for the Steelers on Monday. He was recently released by the 49ers a day after they had placed him on injured reserve with a calf injury.  Valdes-Scantling chose to sign with the 49ers' practice squad this summer instead of joining the Steelers because he thought San Francisco presented him with a better opportunity given the 49ers' injuries at his position. And while he did play in five games, he caught just four passes for 40 yards during his brief time there. \nAn eight-year veteran, Valdes-Scantling spent his first four NFL seasons with Rodgers in Green Bay. During their third season together, Valdes-Scantling led the league in average yards per catch while helping Rodgers win his third league MVP award. \nAfter four years in Green Bay, Valdes-Scantling won two Super Bowls with the Kansas City Chiefs while developing a quick chemistry with quarterback Patrick Mahomes. His value was especially evident in the playoffs, as Valdes-Scantling caught three touchdown passes during the 2022 and 2023 postseasons. He caught a touchdown pass during Kansas City's Super Bowl LVIII win over the 49ers. Valdes-Scantling's first taste of postseason success occurred years earlier in Green Bay. In the 2020 NFC title game, he caught 4 of 6 targets for 115 yards and a score in the Packers' 31-26 loss to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Valdes-Scantling will join the Steelers after spending parts of the past two seasons with the 49ers, Bills and Saints. In Pittsburgh, he'll join an offense that has long been searching for depth at the receiver position.\n The Steelers' receiving group has been led by DK Metcalf and fellow wideout Calvin Austin III. Pittsburgh's passing game so far has also included a steady diet of running backs Kenneth Gainwell, Jaylen Warren and tight ends Jonnu Smith, Pat Freiermuth and Darnell Washington. Along with getting a chance to play for a first-place team, it's safe to say Rodgers is a considerable reason why Valdes-Scantling is coming to Pittsburgh. \"He is a competitor,\" Valdes-Scantling told CBS Sports in 2023 when asked about Rodgers. \"Especially if he gets into a situation where he can prove someone wrong. He will live and die by it.\" \nValdes-Scantling will became the latest former teammate of Rodgers from his Packer days to reunite with him. He played with fellow Packers teammates Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams during his brief tenure with the New York Jets. Speaking of the Packers, the Steelers have begun the process of shaking off this past Sunday night's 35-25 loss to Rodgers' former team. While the defense was largely to blame for the loss, Rodgers acknowledged afterward that the offense could have been better on third down. The Steelers were a dreadful 1 of 10 on third down, which contributed to the team settling for three Chris Boswell field goals during the first half of Sunday night's eventual loss. \"Well, just an honest assessment,\" Rodgers said afterward when asked how the Steelers can snap out of their two-game losing streak. \"I think, setting feelings aside and being OK with criticism, any position, any player, and being honest about what we need to do to improve. And then, we can't beat ourselves. \n\"I think in the three losses, there's been times where we've had opportunities and we've hurt ourselves with either turnovers or just negative plays. So we've got to cut those out. We've gotta get on the same page on both offense and defense, and keep the faith.\" \n            ",

This marks the first standard NBA contract McClung has signed. The Pacers will reportedly waive former No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman to create room on roster. The 26-year-old guard, who went undrafted in 2021 out of Texas Tech, has appeared in a total of six NBA games for the Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. McClung has averaged 5.5 points, 2.2 assists and 2.3 rebounds per game while shooting 43% from the field. McClung won NBA G League MVP while playing for the Osceola Magic in 2024. He has also been named All-NBA G League First Team in each of the last two seasons. McClung is known for his incredible dunking ability, which made him famous in his high school years. \nIn 2023, McClung was invited to participate in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest while on a two-way contract with the 76ers, and recorded perfect 50s on all of his dunks minus one. He defeated Trey Murphy III in the final. McClung returned and repeated as dunk champion in 2024, and then became the first player in NBA history to win the dunk contest three years in a row in 2025. Nate Robinson is the only other NBA player to win the dunk contest three times.\nThe Pacers are off to an 0-3 start following last year's 50-32 campaign, which ended in the NBA Finals. Indiana is dealing with a number of injuries, which led them to turn to McClung. Tyrese Haliburton will of course miss the entire season due to the torn Achilles he suffered in June, then Bennedict Mathurin (toe), Obi Toppin (hamstring), Andrew Nembhard (shoulder), Taelon Peter (groin) and Johnny Furphy (foot) are all banged up as well. \nIndiana returns to action this Wednesday, when they travel to take on Cooper Flagg and the Dallas Mavericks. \n            \n    ",

With Kansas City's win, that means that 12 of the 13 played in Week 8 were decided by double digits. That means only one game was decided by one-score, marking the the first time since Week 14 of the 1970 season that we've seen anything like that. Everyone got blown out ... well, except for the New York Jets.Going into Week 8, there was only one winless team in the NFL, but that's not the case anymore after the New York Jets pulled off a stunning 39-38 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. The Jets were trailing by 14 points with eight minutes left to play in the fourth quarter, but they pulled off the shocker after Breece Hall threw a game-winning touchdown pass (That is not a typo, Breece Hall threw a TD pass to put the Jets ahead with 1:54 left to play). How shocking was this win? It was the Jets' second-largest fourth-quarter comeback in franchise history. They trailed by 15 points at the start of the fourth quarter, but managed to outscore the Bengals 23-8 in the final quarter to pull off the win. Hall became the first running back since 2000 to throw a go-ahead TD in the final two minutes of a game. The last time it happened also came with the Jets when Curtis Martin threw a go-ahead TD back in 2000. Hall became just the third running back in NFL history to score two rushing touchdowns AND throw a TD pass in a single quarter (Hall did all of that in the fourth quarter). This game marked the first time since 2001 that the Jets topped 500 yards. The last time it happened also came against the Bengals. It was a great win for the Jets, but an ugly loss for the Bengals. \nWith that in mind, let's get to the Week 8 grades, starting with the Chiefs dominating win on Monday night. \n        \n            \n                The tush push didn't die in a meeting room; it died on a Sunday in Philadelphia\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas City 28-7 over WashingtonN.Y.

    "body": "\n        Carson Wentz has been placed on injured reserve and will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Wentz made five starts this season for the Vikings in relief of starting quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who is expected to return to the lineup for this week's game against the Detroit Lions. Along with McCarthy, the Vikings' quarterback room consists of Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie who will now move up to the No. 2 spot on the depth chart. Brosmer, who started for the Minnesota Gophers last season, has made three relief appearances this season, going 5 of 8 passing for 42 yards. Wentz played with considerable pain in his left (non-throwing) shoulder for more than half of his five starts, according to the Vikings' website. The former Pro Bowl quarterback appeared to be in obvious pain during Minnesota's most recent game, a 37-10 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that saw Wentz leave before its conclusion. A 10-year veteran, Wentz won two of his first three starts for the Vikings while filling in for McCarthy, who suffered a high-ankle sprain during Minnesota's Week 2 loss to the Falcons. \nWentz sustained his shoulder injury during the first half of the Vikings' Week 5 win over the Browns in London. Despite the injury, Wentz stayed in the game and ultimately led a game-winning drive that included him going 9 of 9 passing while throwing the game-winning touchdown pass to Jordan Addison with 25 seconds left. After using the Vikings' Week 6 bye to rehab his injury, Wentz tried but was unable to lead the Vikings to wins in their subsequent games against the Eagles (his former team) and Chargers. He pleaded with Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell to remain in last week's game against the Chargers despite being sacked five times and clearly being in pain. Wentz did his best, but it'll now be up to McCarthy to help turn the Vikings' season around. Minnesota is currently 3-4 and in last place in the NFC North.\nWhat does this mean for Wentz's future?For all intents and purposes, Wentz's Vikings career is probably a wrap. He was brought in as emergency insurance, and he was called upon to a great degree in a short amount of time. But he was uneven in dire circumstances, and he was always going to be a short-term Band-Aid anyway. Only a flawless and near-undefeated run would've convinced Vikings brass to pivot all the way off the McCarthy experiment, which has hardly left the ground.More than that, Wentz's injury-fueled exit may also spell the end of the quarterback's NFL career. That's mostly a result of the physical wear and tear he suffered behind Minnesota's shaky front. Imperfect as he may have been handling the ball as Kevin O'Connell's point guard, he showed enough in his brief Vikings tenure to warrant another backup gig somewhere else. It's just that he's also nearing his mid-30s after a decade of NFL service and took such a visible toll this year.Considering he waited quite a while to land his last two backup gigs, it's possible Wentz could decide that he's had his fill of taking a beating on the NFL stage. Then again, his own rugged persistence is part of the reason he suffered such serious shoulder injuries at all; maybe his never-say-die mentality will be enough to have him angling for one last opportunity in 2026.\nWhat does this mean for the Vikings?For one, it underscores the cold reality that Minnesota simply wasn't prepared to weather such turmoil under center. None of the club's individual quarterback decisions -- letting Sam Darnold walk, declining to pursue Aaron Rodgers with full conviction, etc. -- was egregious on its own. But Wentz ended up becoming a sort of sacrificial lamb in the wake of McCarthy's unreadiness.What we don't talk enough about is the fact [Wentz was] at the center of Minnesota's conundrum -- to hurry McCarthy back or to pivot to undrafted rookie Max Brosmer? -- despite only joining the team on Aug. 24. Look, some quarterbacks can turn around and help a franchise stay afloat on a few days' notice (see: Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals, at least briefly). But the Bengals had Joe Burrow as their Plan A. The Vikings had McCarthy, a total unknown.What's done is done. The Vikings made 2025 about McCarthy. And then McCarthy sputtered out of the gate before going down (again). It should be no surprise, a few weeks later, they're hurting to get things under control at the quarterback position, not so unlike halfway through the 2023 season when Kirk Cousins was sidelined and O'Connell was left to squeeze what he could from Joshua Dobbs, another last-minute backup addition, and assorted leftovers.\n        \n            \n                Did the Vikings botch their QB situation? Reassessing Minnesota's now-bumpy bet on J.J. McCarthy, backup plans\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPractically, however, Wentz's move to injured all but ensures McCarthy will make his long-awaited return sooner rather than later. Visiting Detroit to take on the vaunted Lions in Week 9 probably isn't the launching pad the Vikings had in mind for their second-year signal-caller coming off injury, but then again, nothing has really gone according to plan at the position. McCarthy, meanwhile, may get somewhat of a pass if he isn't lights out in his first game(s) back. But he'll also be under serious pressure to make good on the 2025 campaign as Year 2 of his rookie contract quickly fades away.And if he can't stay on the field again? Brosmer, the former Golden Gophers prospect, may well be the next name we're discussing as the unfortunate face of the Vikings' offense.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Stop us if you've heard this before: The Browns wasted a Myles Garrett masterpiece Sunday.Cleveland's superstar edge rusher recorded a franchise-record five sacks (as well as one forced fumble), wreaking havoc on Drake Maye and the Patriots all game long. He beat double teams. He made a mockery of one-on-one scenarios. He won from the left side and the right. He chased down Maye, an outstanding athlete, on multiple occasions.It didn't matter much. The Browns lost 32-13 to fall to 2-6, even with Garrett recording just the 20th five-sack game in NFL history. Entering Sunday, players with a five-sack game had a 16-3 record. None of the three players who lost had lost by more than three points. The Browns lost by 19.So even though Garrett's highlights are absurd, the clip that's gained the most attention is this one of him slamming his helmet late in the defeat.\nHe sat by himself at the end of the bench as the clock wound down, and afterwards, he was matter-of-fact about his frustration.\"It doesn't get any easier each week you ask me,\" Garrett said regarding the team's inability to create an offense conducive to winning football games.\"I would throw the whole performance away for a win,\" he said about his own accomplishments.\nThe Browns are 55-84-1 since Garrett arrived as the top pick in 2017, the seventh-worst mark in the NFL over that span, and have made the postseason just twice. The team has churned through 15 starting quarterbacks over that span, though it doesn't appear that No. 16 is on the way after head coach Kevin Stefanski said he'll stick with struggling rookie Dillon Gabriel after the bye.That frustration played a part in Garrett requesting a trade in early February. By the end of the month, reports emerged that he was unwilling to sign a contract extension with the franchise. In early March, reports emerged that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam wouldn't meet with Garrett, who was considering sitting out games.But two days after that report, Garrett signed a four-year, $160 million extension with Cleveland. At $40 million per year, it made Garrett the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time. Later in the offseason, another pass rusher, Micah Parsons, took that throne. Notably, though, that payday came after the Cowboys granted his trade request, shipping him to the Packers in a stunning blockbuster deal.\nSunday's outburst and comments show Garrett's frustration has boiled over again. With the trade deadline nearing, it's only natural to wonder if Garrett, tied for the NFL lead with 10.0 sacks, could be on the move. A deeper examination, though, shows it won't happen.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Rams bolster defense\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGarrett's frustration with Browns\"As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl -- and that goal fuels me today more than ever,\" Garrett said in a Feb. 3 statement when he requested his trade from the Browns. \"My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today.\"While I've loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won't allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl.\n\"With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.\"That second-to-last sentence seemed especially pertinent -- and a bit of a shot. Garrett's trade request came roughly a week after general manager Andrew Berry said he had no intentions of trading Garrett and \"we envision him going from Cleveland to Canton when his career is over.\"Canton, of course, is where the Pro Football Hall of Fame resides. Garrett is undoubtedly on that path. He's a six-time All-Pro (four-time first-team selection) and six-time Pro Bowler. He won the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year, between finishing in the award's top five in 2022 and 2024. He's tied for the NFL lead with 10.0 sacks this season and, at 29 years old, has shown no signs of slowing down.As has been the case throughout much of his career, the Browns are struggling. After losing to the Bengals 17-16 in Week 1 -- kicker Andre Szmyt missed an extra point and a short field goal -- Cleveland got blown out by Baltimore 47-10, and Garrett couldn't hide his frustration.\n\"I mean, this shit is embarrassing,\" Garrett said after the Browns allowed 31 second-half points. \"We got to be better on defense. We got to be better as a team. They slowly chipped away and we did a solid job, holding them to three when we could, and then eventually the dam broke and they just did whatever they wanted, and we have to continue to play a 60-minute game.\"Could the Browns actually trade him?The short answer is technically \"yes.\" There is no rule that's stopping them. But let's make this clear: The Browns won't trade Garrett this season.There are several issues at play. First, there's the financial aspect. Trading Garrett would trigger a dead cap hit of nearly $68 million for the 2026 season. For reference, the largest single-season dead money hit in NFL history is Russell Wilson's $53 million, stemming from the Broncos cutting ties with him in 2024.\nThen there's the return.\"That's probably more of an offseason consideration when Cleveland could maximize draft choice compensation,\" said Joel Corry, a former NFL agent and current CBS Sports analyst, via text last month. \"I'm assuming Myles Garrett would be more likely to waive his no trade clause for an expected playoff contender.\"He is making $31.5M in 2026. The trade would have to be within the first 15 days of the 2026 league year because that's when a $29.2 million payment is due to exercise a dummy (voiding) 2031 contract year.\"That is the biggest difference between the Parsons trade and any potential Garrett move. Garrett has already been paid. Parsons hadn't been.\nIt's easy to see why Garrett is frustrated. No one likes losing. No one likes seeing historic performances go to waste. But Garrett knew a season like this was a likely reality when he signed his then-record-breaking deal. He will have to stick out another lost season in Cleveland.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a rare early Sunday afternoon kickoff, the Kansas City Chiefs are back on primetime as they'll host the Washington Commanders on 'Monday Night Football' to conclude the NFL Week 8 schedule. Last week's afternoon contest saw Kansas City (4-3) shut out the Raiders, 31-0, as the Chiefs have won four of their last five games. Meanwhile, Washington (2-4) lost both its Week 7 game to the Cowboys, 44-22, and its quarterback in Jayden Daniels (hamstring) to injury. Marcus Mariota will start in his place, though the Commanders have receivers Terry McLaurin (hell) and Deebo Samuel (quad) back this week. Washington defensive lineman Daron Payne (toe) is questionable, while kicker Matt Gay (back) has been ruled out. Offensive tackle (personal) Josh Simmons is out for Kansas City, while offensive guard Trey Smith (back) is doubtful.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.

Mahomes became the first quarterback since 2000 to have 200 passing yards and three passing touchdowns over his first three drives as the Chiefs offense is clicking on all cylinders with the return of wideout Rashee Rice. He had seven catches for 42 yards and two scores in his first game in over a calendar year.The Chiefs are 10-1 all-time versus the Washington franchise, including a current eight-game win streak in which their average margin of victory is 18.6 points. Kansas City's ascending passing game will get to face one of the league's worst pass defenses as Washington ranks dead last in yards per attempt allowed and yards per completion allowed.

You might have to make several adjustments as the week goes on depending on injuries and the looming trade deadline on Nov. 4.  First, let's start with the four teams on a bye (Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Cleveland and the Jets). There are a lot of good players who are off this week, as well as several players you might want to add for the remainder of the season, including Justin Fields, Harold Fannin Jr., David Njoku and Mason Taylor. More on those players below.  We also don't know the extent of some players who were injured in Week 8 that are on a bye in Week 9, including Quinshon Judkins (shoulder) and Saquon Barkley (groin). Depending on the severity of those injuries, you might want to prioritize Dylan Sampson and Tank Bigsby now, which you can read about here.  And, we could see some trades happen this week, including guys like Breece Hall, Tony Pollard, Jakobi Meyers, Calvin Ridley and Chigoziem Okonkwo potentially on the move. If those players are dealt, some guys who would benefit would be Tyjae Spears, Isaiah Davis, Tre Tucker, Chimere Dike and Gunnar Helm, which we'll discuss below.  We'll also get into the players you need to add based on recent performances or good matchups, including Sam Darnold, Trevor Lawrence, Zonovan Knight and Troy Franklin. And we'll highlight why Tyrone Tracy Jr. should be added in all leagues with Cam Skattebo (ankle) now unfortunately out for the season.Editor's note: For this waiver wire column, we are only looking at players rostered in less than 65 percent of CBS Sports leagues.\n        Week 9 Waivers\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Quarterbacks\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: Jalen Hurts, Baker Mayfield, Justin Fields and Dillon Gabriel.  Injuries: Lamar Jackson (hamstring), Jayden Daniels (hamstring), Brock Purdy (toe), Kyler Murray (foot), Michael Penix Jr. (foot), J.J. McCarthy (ankle), Carson Wentz (shoulder), Bryce Young (ankle), Joe Burrow (toe) and Anthony Richardson (eye).  Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Joe Flacco (84 percent rostered), Brock Purdy (72 percent), Aaron Rodgers (72 percent), Kyler Murray (71 percent) and C.J. Stroud (67 percent). Flacco has scored at least 22.8 Fantasy points in all three starts for the Bengals and has top-10 upside in all leagues for as long as he remains the starter in Cincinnati, including Week 9 against the Bears. ... Purdy has missed the past four games but will hopefully return in Week 9 at the Giants. In two games this season, Purdy has scored at least 20.8 Fantasy points in each outing. ... Rodgers has scored at least 20.8 Fantasy points in three games in a row, and he should be considered a low-end starter in all leagues in Week 9 against the Colts. He also has favorable upcoming games against Cincinnati in Week 11 and Chicago in Week 12. ... Murray comes back from a bye in Week 8 and a two-game absence with a foot injury with a great matchup against Dallas in Week 9. Hopefully, we'll see Murray at 100 percent, and he can perform like a low-end starter in all leagues. ... I don't love Stroud's matchup in Week 9 against Denver, but he gets Jacksonville in Week 10 and Tennessee in Week 11. He has scored at least 22.4 Fantasy points in three of his past four games, and it might be time to trust him as a low-end starter in deeper leagues when he has a favorable matchup.  Drop candidates: Kirk Cousins (45 percent rostered) and Carson Wentz (30 percent). Cousins started for Penix in Week 8 against Miami and struggled with just 7.1 Fantasy points, and Penix is expected to return in Week 9. ...

The Jets have a bye in Week 9, but Fields could prove to be a weekly starter to close the season, especially when Garrett Wilson (knee) is back, which could be in Week 10. It's not a bad idea to stash Fields in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIA\n                    \n                         \n                        Miami\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 27\n                                                                        • Experience: 6 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BAL -7.5\n                                    O/U 50.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                29th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                24th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                31%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    1518\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    38\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    15\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    16.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                We'll see if Tagovailoa just had a surprise outing in Week 8 at Atlanta with 32.2 Fantasy points, or if this is a sign of things to come. He's had an up-and-down season so far with four games of at least 19.7 Fantasy points and three games with 8.6 points or less, and he might be tough to trust, including in Week 9 against the Ravens. But starting in Week 11, Tagovailoa faces Washington, then a bye, New Orleans, the Jets, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, and those are all favorable matchups. It might not be a bad idea to stash Tagovailoa in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Minnesota\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            \n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DET\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DET -8.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                23rd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                31%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    301\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    50\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    14.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                McCarthy (ankle) hasn't played since Week 2, but he's back in Week 9 and will hopefully keep the job for the remainder of the season. In two games this year, McCarthy scored 26.2 Fantasy points against Chicago in Week 1 and 2.8 points against Atlanta in Week 2, which is when he was injured. His upcoming schedule is favorable against Detroit in Week 9, Baltimore in Week 10 and Chicago in Week 11, and hopefully, he'll connect well with Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. There's plenty of upside for McCarthy, and he's worth stashing in all leagues if you need a quarterback for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NO\n                    \n                         \n                        New Orleans\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAR -13.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                6th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                3%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    128\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    2.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Fantasy managers in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues should add Shough now in case he takes over as the starter for the Saints heading into Week 9 at the Rams. There's limited upside for Shough, who replaced Spencer Rattler in the third quarter of Week 8 against Tampa Bay and finished with 128 passing yards, no touchdowns and an interception, along with 12 rushing yards. But in case he does become the full-time starter, Shough could be a useful bye-week replacement in deeper leagues. In Superflex and two-quarterback leagues, Shough is worth adding for at least 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Running Backs\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: Saquon Barkley, Tank Bigsby, Bucky Irving, Rachaad White, Sean Tucker, Breece Hall, Isaiah Davis, Quinshon Judkins, Jerome Ford and Dylan Sampson.  Injuries: Cam Skattebo (ankle), Saquon Barkley (groin), Quinshon Judkins (shoulder), Bucky Irving (shoulder), Hassan Haskins (hamstring), Emari Demercado (ankle), Omarion Hampton (ankle), Trey Benson (knee), Joe Mixon (foot), Braelon Allen (knee) and MarShawn Lloyd (hamstring).  Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Tyler Allgeier (77 percent rostered), Kyle Monangai (70 percent) and Trey Benson (68 percent). Allgeier should be considered a super handcuff because he has lottery-ticket appeal if Bijan Robinson were to miss any time, and Allgeier plays enough in tandem with Robinson that he can be a flex option in deeper leagues. Allgeier has scored at least 9.4 PPR points in four of his past six games coming into Week 9 at New England. ... Monangai continues to get increased playing time for the Bears, and he has played 45 percent of the snaps in the past two games against New Orleans and Baltimore. He's worth rostering in all leagues as a handcuff to D'Andre Swift, and Monangai could be a useful flex option in deeper leagues when he's getting at least seven touches per game. ... Benson is eligible to return in Week 10 after being out for four games with a knee injury, and hopefully he'll be 100 percent for the remainder of the season. When healthy, Benson has the potential to be a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues.  Drop candidates: Cam Skattebo (100 percent rostered), Nick Chubb (77 percent), Justice Hill (44 percent) and Michael Carter (37 percent). Unfortunately, Skattebo is out for the season after hurting his ankle in Week 8. He should be dropped in all redraft leagues, and we hope he can return at 100 percent for the start of the 2026 campaign. ... Chubb will hopefully continue to cede more work to Woody Marks, who is the best running back for the Texans right now. Chubb has scored 8.9 PPR points or less in four of his past five games heading into Week 9. ... Hill will have some moments of positive production as the year goes on, but he has minimal Fantasy value as long as Derrick Henry is healthy, especially with Keaton Mitchell getting work for the Ravens. In Week 8 against Chicago, Hill had one carry for 2 yards and no targets, and Mitchell had four carries for 43 yards in tandem with Henry. ... Carter was cut by the Cardinals on Monday, although ESPN reports he's expected to be back with the team. Either way, he's not expected to help Fantasy managers much, especially with Benson likely back in Week 10. At best, Carter will be the No. 2 running back in Arizona behind Zonovan Knight, and Carter has combined for just 16 carries for 45 yards and four catches for 55 yards on seven targets in his past two games.\nAdd in this order:     Week 9 Waiver Priority List\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

He's worth adding in all leagues for at least 50 percent of your remaining FAB, if not more. After Skattebo was injured against the Eagles, Tracy had 10 carries for 39 yards and two catches for 14 yards on three targets. He's struggled so far this season in tandem with Skattebo, but Tracy scored at least 14.5 PPR points in three of his final six games in 2024 as a rookie. This Giants offense is better than last year's version, and Skattebo scored at least 13 PPR points in six games in a row prior to Week 8. I'm hopeful Tracy can perform like a low-end starter for the remainder of the season, but we also have to see what happens with Devin Singletary (2 percent rostered), who should remain involved and is worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB in deeper leagues. That said, Tracy has plenty of upside, so add him in all leagues where available.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #20\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DAL -3\n                                    O/U 54\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                31st\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                54%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    102\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    40\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                We said going into Arizona's bye in Week 8 that Knight should be added in all leagues for his matchup against Dallas in Week 9. Trey Benson (knee) is not eligible to return until Week 10 at the earliest, and Knight should get the majority of touches against the Cowboys, who are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. Knight has scored at least 9.4 PPR points in three games in a row, with two touchdowns over that span, and he has 25 carries in his past two outings against Indianapolis and Green Bay. When Benson is healthy, Knight might not have much Fantasy value in the majority of leagues, but he could be at least a flex against Dallas while Benson is out. Knight is worth adding for at least 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Tennessee\n                    \n                                            • #2\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAC -10\n                                    O/U 43.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                31st\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                60%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    126\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    60\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Tony Pollard could get traded, which would put Spears in line to be the featured running back for the Titans. But even if Pollard stays in Tennessee, Spears is getting enough work to be considered a flex option in the majority of leagues. He just had his best game of the season in Week 9 at Indianapolis with nine carries for 59 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 23 yards on three targets. And he's now scored at least 7 PPR points in three games in a row, and he has at least eight total touches in all three outings. Spears should be added in all leagues for up to 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CLE\n                    \n                         \n                        Cleveland\n                    \n                                            • #22\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NYJ\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    NYJ -2.5\n                                    O/U 40.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                11%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    51\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    133\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    5.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Kevin Stefanski said Monday that Quinshon Judkins (shoulder) is day-to-day after getting hurt in Week 8 at New England, and the Browns have a bye in Week 9. But we'll keep an eye on what happens with Judkins, and if he's out for Week 10 at the Jets, then Sampson and Jerome Ford (17 percent rostered) could be potential flex options in all leagues. I'd lean toward Sampson over Ford, and Sampson just had five catches for 29 yards on six targets and three carries for no yards against the Patriots. Ford had no carries and one catch for minus-1 yard on two targets. It's worth it to add Sampson and Ford now, just in case Judkins can't play after the bye, and Sampson should be added in all leagues for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB. Ford should be added for 1 percent.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #37\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        GB\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    PHI -1.5\n                                    O/U 45.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                12%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    127\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    -1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    1.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Saquon Barkley downplayed the groin injury that caused him to leave Week 8 against the Giants, and the Eagles have a bye in Week 9, which should give him time to heal. That said, you might want to add Bigsby now just in case Barkley can't play in Week 10, and Bigsby was great against the Giants with nine carries for 104 yards. He would be a No. 2 running back in all leagues if Barkley was out, and Bigsby should be added for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYJ\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

He's worth adding in all leagues as the handcuff for Breece Hall, even with the Jets on a bye in Week 9, and the trade deadline is Nov. 4. Hall is one of the top trade candidates, and Davis would be a borderline starter in all leagues if he was the No. 1 running back for the Jets.

Alvin Kamara played through a brief injury scare against the Buccaneers and will hopefully be fine. However, if Kamara were to miss any time, then Neal would be a borderline starter in all leagues. He's worth adding for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Cincinnati\n                    \n                                            • #34\n                                            \n                                            Age: 30\n                                                                        • Experience: 9 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CHI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -2.5\n                                    O/U 52.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                22nd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                47th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                7%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    193\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    4.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Perine exploded with nine carries for 94 yards and a touchdown and one catch for 6 yards on one target in Week 8 at the Jets. He has been getting more work lately in tandem with Chase Brown, with at least six total touches in four games in a row, and Perine took advantage of the matchup with the Jets with some explosive plays, including a 32-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Perine would be a borderline starter in all leagues if Brown were to miss any time, and Perine is a potential flex option in deeper formats in his current role. He's worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        GB\n                    \n                         \n                        Green Bay\n                    \n                                            • #23\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -12.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                14th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                48th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                17%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    162\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    57\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    4.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Wilson is starting to look like a super handcuff to Josh Jacobs, and Wilson is worth adding in all leagues for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB. In Week 8 at Pittsburgh, Wilson had 11 carries for 61 yards and three catches for 26 yards on four targets. He's now scored at least 11.1 PPR points in two of his past four games, and he's a lottery ticket in case something happens to Jacobs. He's also a potential flex option in deeper formats, given two of his performances in the past month.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Wide Receivers\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, Emeka Egbuka, Chris Godwin, Tez Johnson, Garrett Wilson, and Jerry Jeudy.  Injuries: Drake London (hip), A.J. Brown (hamstring), Nico Collins (concussion), Puka Nacua (foot), Brian Thomas Jr. (shoulder), Garrett Wilson (knee), Chris Godwin (leg), Ricky Pearsall (knee), Jakobi Meyers (knee), Calvin Ridley (hamstring), Marvin Mims (concussion), Luther Burden III (concussion), Christian Kirk (hamstring), Cedric Tillman (hamstring), Jayden Reed (collarbone), Brandon Aiyuk (knee) and Jalen McMillan (neck).  Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Khalil Shakir (83 percent rostered), Rashid Shaheed (80 percent), Jakobi Meyers (77 percent), Travis Hunter (77 percent), Chris Godwin (73 percent), Kayshon Boutte (72 percent), and Darnell Mooney (67 percent). Shakir scored 20.8 PPR points in Week 8 at Carolina, and he's now scored at least 11 PPR points in four of his past five games. Shakir has at least five receptions in three of his past four games heading into Week 9, and he should be considered a high-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues for the rest of the season. ... Shaheed had a solid game in Week 8 against Tampa Bay with nine catches for 75 yards on 12 targets. He now has 21 targets in his past two games, and he has scored at least 14.5 PPR points in two of his past four outings. Shaheed is a potential trade candidate, so keep an eye on what happens, as is Chris Olave. For now, consider Shaheed a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues heading into Week 9 at the Rams. ... Meyers is a trade candidate, and his Fantasy value would improve if he left Las Vegas. We don't know if he'll play in Week 9 against Jacksonville after he sat out in Week 7 with a knee injury before the Raiders' bye in Week 8. When healthy, he can still be a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues, even if he stays in Las Vegas. But we would love to see Meyers dealt to a new team with better quarterback play to enhance his value for the rest of the year. ... Hunter had his best game of the season prior to Jacksonville's bye in Week 7 against the Rams with eight catches for 101 yards and a touchdown on 14 targets. The Jaguars will hopefully continue to feature Hunter more in Week 9 and beyond, and he should be added in all leagues. ... Godwin has missed the past three games with a leg injury, and we'll see if he can return after Tampa Bay's bye in Week 9. There's no guarantee what version of Godwin we'll get when healthy, but he's worth stashing on your bench to find out. With Mike Evans (collarbone) out, Godwin could be a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues when healthy. ... Boutte has scored a touchdown in three games in a row, with four touchdowns over that span, and he has boom-or-bust potential as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. He hasn't had more than five targets in any game in his past three outings, which is a concern, but he's connecting on deep throws from Drake Maye, who is playing at an MVP level. Boutte has two outings in his past three games with at least 75 receiving yards, and he has scored at least 16.3 PPR points in all three games this season when he's had at least five targets. ... Mooney was a dud in Week 8 against Miami with one catch for 11 yards on four targets, which was disappointing with Drake London (hip) out. But we don't know when London will return to action, and Mooney might benefit with Michael Penix Jr. under center since Kirk Cousins started against the Dolphins. I still want to roster Mooney in the majority of leagues.  Drop candidates: Matthew Golden (78 percent rostered), Keon Coleman (73 percent), Jerry Jeudy (68 percent), and Kendrick Bourne (62 percent). Golden has plenty of potential, but he'll be tough to trust now that Christian Watson is back. In Week 8 at Pittsburgh, with Watson making his 2025 debut, Golden had just three catches for 4 yards on three targets, and he now has seven catches for 41 yards on seven targets in his past two games. He's also failed to score a touchdown this season, and I would only roster Golden in dynasty and long-term keeper leagues for now. ... Coleman had three catches for 30 yards on four targets in Week 8 at Carolina and has now scored 7.5 PPR points or less in five of his past six games. There's little reason to trust him in the majority of leagues moving forward, and the Bills could add a wide receiver via trade at the upcoming deadline. ... Jeudy had no catches on two targets in Week 8 at New England, and he has now scored 9.3 PPR points or less in seven games in a row, with no touchdowns this year. There's no reason to roster Jeudy in the majority of leagues with Cleveland on a bye in Week 9. ... In two games since George Kittle returned from his hamstring injury, Bourne has struggled with five catches for 58 yards on six targets against the Falcons and Texans. Granted, those were tough matchups against Atlanta and Houston, but Kittle, Christian McCaffrey, and Jauan Jennings are the priority in the passing game now, ahead of Bourne, who should be dropped in all 10-team leagues and most 12-team formats.Add in this order:Week 7 Waiver Priority List\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n

two touchdowns on eight targets, and he now has 18 targets and three touchdowns in his past two outings against the Cowboys and Giants. Marvin Mims (concussion) could miss Week 9 at Houston, which won't be an easy matchup, but Franklin should be added in all leagues where available for up to 10 percent of your remaining FAB. After facing the Texans, Franklin could be a must-start receiver in Week 10 against Las Vegas, especially if Mims remains out.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Tennessee\n                    \n                                            • #17\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAC -10\n                                    O/U 43.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                8th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                14%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    189\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    5.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Dike has stepped up in the past two weeks against New England and Indianapolis with 11 catches for 163 yards and a touchdown on 12 targets, and he scored at least 16.4 PPR points in each game. Calvin Ridley (hamstring) has missed those two games, and we'll see if Ridley can return in Week 9 against the Chargers. Although Tennessee has a bye in Week 10. Additionally, Ridley could be a trade candidate, so the Titans might decide to move on from him and feature Dike and Elic Ayomanor (28 percent rostered), who had four catches for 52 yards on eight targets against the Colts in Week 8. Dike is worth adding in all leagues for at least 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB, and Ayomanor is worth adding for 1 percent.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

However, he had a 68-yard touchdown called back in the fourth quarter due to a questionable pass interference call, and hopefully, we'll continue to see him make those plays moving forward. He should do well playing off Wan'Dale Robinson as a go-to option for Jaxson Dart, and Slayton is worth adding in all leagues for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        GB\n                    \n                         \n                        Green Bay\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -12.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                2nd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                45%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    85\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    12.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Watson made his 2025 debut in Week 8 at Pittsburgh in his return to action from last year's torn ACL, and he played well with four catches for 85 yards on four targets. We'll see how he does moving forward while competing with Tucker Kraft, Romeo Doubs, and Matthew Golden for targets, especially when Jayden Reed (foot) is healthy. But for now, it's easy to speculate on Watson as a potential No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues heading into Week 9 against Carolina for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n

Jakobi Meyers went into the Week 8 bye with a knee injury, but he could also be traded ahead of the Nov. 4 deadline. If that happens, then Jack Bech (4 percent rostered) could benefit as well. As for Tucker, even if Meyers stays on the team, he has scored at least 11.1 PPR points in three of his past five games. Tucker should be added in all formats for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB, and Bech is worth adding for 1 percent in deeper leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n

     I'm looking forward to seeing what Jennings can do when Brock Purdy (toe) is back for the 49ers, and Jennings has the potential to be a solid No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. Despite George Kittle returning from his hamstring injury in Week 7, Jennings has still had seven targets in each of the past two games against Atlanta and Houston, which are tough matchups. He only had eight catches for 76 yards over that span with no touchdowns, but I like the upside for Jennings when Purdy is healthy. Jennings is worth adding for 5 to 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #14\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -1.5\n                                    O/U 39.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                3rd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                37th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                14%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    162\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    5.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                There are several things to monitor for the Texans receivers heading into Week 9 against Denver, notably the health of Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring). Collins missed Week 8 against San Francisco, and Kirk has been out for the past two outings. With both out against the 49ers, Noel, Jayden Higgins (21 percent rostered), and Xavier Hutchinson (2 percent rostered) stepped up and would be worth adding in all leagues for Week 9. If Kirk remains out, then I like Noel the best, and he has nine catches for 140 yards on 13 targets in his past two games. He might have long-term value even when Kirk is healthy, so add him for 5 percent of your remaining FAB. Higgins would likely only benefit if Collins is out, and Higgins had four catches for 34 yards and a touchdown on eight targets against San Francisco. He's worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB since we don't know if Collins can play against the Broncos. And I would take a flier on Hutchinson in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB. He had five catches for 69 yards and a touchdown on six targets against the 49ers and also scored 16.8 PPR points at Baltimore in Week 5, but I don't expect him to be consistent when everyone is healthy, which is why he's lower on my list heading into Week 9.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n

targets. He could emerge as the No. 2 receiver for the Steelers opposite DK Metcalf, but keep an eye on Pittsburgh making a trade for a receiver. Austin is worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB in all leagues. In deeper leagues, you can also take a flier on Roman Wilson (2 percent rostered), who had four catches for 74 yards and a touchdown on five targets against the Packers. Prior to that game, even with Austin out, Wilson had three catches for 29 yards on three targets, so don't expect much from him now that Austin is healthy.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIA\n                    \n                         \n                        Miami\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BAL -7.5\n                                    O/U 50.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                31st\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                18%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    38\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    135\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Washington scored his first touchdown of the season in Week 8 at Atlanta with four catches for 36 yards on five targets, and he now has 13 targets in his past two games. We'll see if he can start making plays opposite Jaylen Waddle, and the Dolphins need him to step up with Tyreek Hill (knee) out. I would only look at Washington in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB, but hopefully, Week 8 is the start of a strong finish for him this season.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Tight End\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: Dallas Goedert, Cade Otton, Mason Taylor, Harold Fannin Jr., and David Njoku.  Injuries: Brock Bowers (knee), Darren Waller (pectoral), Cole Kmet (back), Mike Gesicki (pectoral,) and Brenton Strange (quadriceps).  Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Oronde Gadsden II (77 percent rostered), Cade Otton (72 percent), and Theo Johnson (67 percent). Gadsden looks like a must-start Fantasy tight end for the rest of the season after he has scored at least 11.8 PPR points in three games in a row, including 12 catches for 241 yards and two touchdowns in his past two games against the Colts and Vikings. ... Otton nearly caught a touchdown in Week 8 at New Orleans but finished with just four catches for 40 yards on five targets. With Mike Evans (collarbone) out, I still want to roster Otton in the majority of leagues, even with Tampa Bay on a bye in Week 9. Prior to Week 8, Otton had scored at least 10.1 PPR points in three games in a row. ... Johnson heads into Week 9 having scored at least 10.7 PPR points in three of his past five games, with the two outings where he failed to reach that total against the Eagles. I like Johnson as a low-end starter in all leagues in Week 9 against San Francisco, especially if Daniel Bellinger (neck) is out.  Drop candidates: Evan Engram (73 percent rostered) and Dalton Schultz (46 percent). Engram had a great matchup in Week 8 against Dallas and finished with just four catches for 36 yards on four targets. He has a tough matchup in Week 9 at Houston, and I would only start Engram in deeper leagues against the Texans. ... Schultz had a great situation in Week 8 against San Francisco with Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring) out, and he failed to deliver with just two catches for 24 yards on three targets. Collins could return in Week 9 against Denver, which isn't an easy matchup, and Schultz will be tough to trust against the Broncos.\nAdd in this order:Week 9 Waiver Priority List\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    18\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    116\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    3.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Loveland is worth a flier in all leagues in Week 9 with his matchup against the Bengals, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. Cincinnati has allowed 10 touchdowns to tight ends, including eight in the past four games. Keep an eye on Cole Kmet (back), who missed Week 8 against the Ravens, and if he remains out, then Loveland could be a low-end starter in all leagues. He just had three catches for 38 yards on five targets against Baltimore, and I would add Loveland for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NO\n                    \n                         \n                        New Orleans\n                    \n                                            • #83\n                                            \n                                            Age: 29\n                                                                        • Experience: 6 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAR -13.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                18th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                33%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    36\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    52\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    368\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Johnson is coming off a solid game in Week 8 against Tampa Bay with five catches for 58 yards on eight targets.

Johnson now has five games this season with at least seven targets, and he scored at least 10.3 PPR points in each of those games. He should be considered a low-end No. 1 Fantasy tight end in all leagues in Week 9 at the Rams, and he should be added for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CLE\n                    \n                         \n                        Cleveland\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NYJ\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    NYJ -2.5\n                                    O/U 40.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                62%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    38\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    51\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    352\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    10.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                I want to roster Fannin and David Njoku (54 percent rostered) even though both are on a bye in Week 9. In Week 8 at New England, Fannin had six catches for 62 yards and a touchdown on eight targets, and Njoku had four catches for 37 yards and a touchdown on five targets. Fannin has now scored at least 11.3 PPR points in three of his past four games, and Njoku has scored at least 13.7 PPR points in two of his past three outings. For the rest of the season, Fannin and Njoku can both be considered low-end starters in the majority of leagues and should be added for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYJ\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

He has now scored at least 11.5 PPR points in three of his past five games, and I would roster him even with the Jets on a bye in Week 9. I like Taylor as a low-end starter in all leagues for the rest of the season, and he's worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Tennessee\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAC -10\n                                    O/U 43.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                6th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                2%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    19\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    172\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    5.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Helm just scored the first touchdown of his career in Week 8 at Indianapolis with two catches for 23 yards on three targets, and we'll see if Chigoziem Okonkwo will be traded at the deadline. If that happens, then Helm could be a low-end starter in deeper leagues, and he's worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB. Okonkwo (8 percent rostered) is also worth adding in with the possibility of a trade, and a new team could enhance his Fantasy value. Okonkwo has also scored at least 8.8 PPR points in three of his past four games and is worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\nDST streamersRams (55 percent

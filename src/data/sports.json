    "body": "\n        Tom Aspinall doesn't want to think about Jon Jones for another second. Jones has occupied enough space in his lungs and mind. As Aspinall prepares to defend the undisputed UFC heavyweight title against Ciryl Gane at UFC 321, he's eager to leave the former champion behind once and for all.  \"I'm over it,\" Aspinall told CBS Sports. \"I'm definitely over it.\"Aspinall spent the better part of two years trying to chase down Jones for a fight. Despite his best efforts, it proved unsuccessful as Jones did everything he could to discredit Aspinall as a legitimate threat to him before eventually retiring. With Jones out of the picture (for now), Aspinall is ready to move on after being named undisputed champ upon Jones' retirement.\"I actually really love fighting,\" Aspinall said. \"Doing that is what I like. Having  nothing holding me back and doing what I enjoy doing, what I got into  this sport to do, is what I'm looking forward to more than anything  else.\"Aspinall was an innocent bystander in the crossfire of fight promotion. In November 2023, he aided UFC 295 by stepping in on short notice to beat Sergei Pavlovich for the interim heavyweight title, replacing an undisputed title fight between Jones and Stipe Miocic after Jones pulled out with a torn pec muscle.\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 321: Why it feels like now or never for title challenger Ciryl Gane to shake misconceptions of his game\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNaturally, the next step should have been a unification bout between interim champion Aspinall and Jones. Instead, the UFC pressed on with Jones vs. Miocic, a fight that was less desirable with each passing day. When the legends finally fought, Miocic looked every bit the 42-year-old coming off a four-and-a-half-year layoff. Jones stopped him easily, 370 days after their first booking had collapsed.The path mercifully cleared for the fight fans wanted -- or so we thought. \"I wasn't really allowed to fight anybody...\" Aspinall said. \"I just wanted to fight.\"  Jones never intended to grant Aspinall the unification he earned. He dismissed Aspinall's name while floating laughable \"super fights\" with Derrick Lewis and Jamahal Hill, and chased a more favorable stylistic matchup against Alex Pereira. Then, without warning, Jones briefly retired and vacated the title in June. Aspinall became the undisputed champion by default.  \n\"I actually found out the same time you did, believe it or not,\" Aspinall said, adding how he felt when he learned of Jones' retirement. \"We finally get to fight then. Let's move on.\"Aspinall largely remained respectful throughout his fruitless pursuit. He flashed a rubber duck on a UFC broadcast to poke fun at Jones for ducking him, but that's mild by fight game standards. When they met in person, it wasn't a brawl, just a polite request for the opportunity he'd earned. Standing across from one of MMA's most polarizing figures, Aspinall held himself to a higher standard.  \"I didn't actively have an idea of how I'd approach it. I approached it  in my usual way,\" Aspinall said. \"I guess that's just the way I am. I don't know. I  didn't try to do anything. I was doing things the only way I know how,  which is by being myself.\"\nCheck out the full interview with Tom Aspinall below.\nAspinall is one of only four fighters to defend an interim UFC title and the longest-reigning interim champion. They're commendable distinctions, but also reminders of a limbo he never wanted.As he prepares to face Gane, Aspinall can finally free himself from being shackled for two years and create his own legacy.\"I just want to fight. I want to be as active as possible. I'm going to  fight as frequently as I can,\" Aspinall said, aiming for three fights in the next 12 months. \"I don't know how that'll look because you  never know what life will throw your way. But I want to get back to what  I do, and what I do is fight people.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays are just a day away from kicking off the 2025 World Series. The Dodgers are looking to become Major League Baseball's first repeat champions in nearly a quarter century, having reached this point by knocking off the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and Milwaukee Brewers. The Blue Jays, conversely, entered the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the American League field and have since defeated the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners.Before the Dodgers and Blue Jays can write the newest chapter of history, we here at CBS Sports thought it would be productive to revisit how they've fared in their past trips to the World Series.Scroll with us, won't you?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Toronto Blue JaysTwo World Series titles (1992, 1993)Three American League pennants (including 2025)Of the two combatants, the Blue Jays have by far the least experience in World Series settings. This will represent just Toronto's third World Series trip in its 48th year of existence. Nonetheless, the Blue Jays to date have only experienced happiness in their Fall Classic appearances.First, in 1992, the Blue Jays defeated the Atlanta Braves in six games. The series saw the Braves inflict some payback on Jack Morris, their conqueror the previous fall (then as a member of the Minnesota Twins). No matter, it was the Blue Jays who prevailed behind strong relief work and a timely Game 6 extra-base hit by Dave Winfield, who had four hits in his 21 other at-bats during the series. \n\"I'm the oldest man in the room, but I'm the happiest man in the room,\" Winfield would tell reporters afterward. \"I didn't do a whole lot, but I did at the right time.\"The series ended in dramatic fashion, with Braves outfielder Otis Nixon dragging a bunt with two outs and the tying run on third base. Blue Jays pitcher Mike Timlin was able to field the ball in time and fire it to first baseman Joe Carter with about a step to spare.Carter played a role in the ending of the 1993 World Series, too. This time, the Blue Jays defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games when Carter launched a walk-off three-run home run against Mitch Williams. Even now, Carter's home run is just the second walk-off, title-winning blast in World Series history, with the other belonging to Bill Mazeroski back in 1960.\nCarter, inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003, said of the above moment: \"They haven't made that word up yet to describe this feeling.\"\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles DodgersSeven World Series titles (1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, 1988, 2020, 2024)14 National League pennants (including 2025)Since relocating from Brooklyn to Los Angeles ahead of the 1958 season, the Dodgers have averaged a World Series appearance better than every five years. That's an impressive statistic when you consider the total includes a nearly 30-year-long drought after their 1988 World Series win. Credit that in part to how the Dodgers have served as one of MLB's main characters over the past decade, to the extent that this will mark their fifth World Series appearance in the last nine years.The Dodgers didn't take long to settle into their new surroundings, reaching and winning the World Series in just their second season in California by topping the Chicago White Sox in six games. That series, even now, may be best remembered for the larger, industry-wide significance than anything that happened on the field. Not only was it the first World Series to be played on the west coast, it was the best-attended World Series in history, with Game 5 alone drawing more than 92,000 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\nThe Dodgers would reach three more World Series during the '60s: winning in '63 and '65 before losing in '66. Lefty Sandy Koufax threw two complete games (including a 15-strikeout performance in Game 1) as part of a sweep versus the New York Yankees in 1963. Koufax would become the first player in MLB history to win the regular season and World Series MVP awards in the same year. Koufax would again win Series MVP and dominate headlines in '65, first by sitting out Game 1 in observance of Yom Kippur and then by firing shutouts against the Minnesota Twins in Games 5 and 7. The Dodgers offense would forget to pack their bats for the '66 against the Baltimore Orioles, suffering shutouts in Games 2 through 4 as part of a sweep. The Dodgers would again make three World Series appearances during the '70s, though they fell short of capturing another title by losing to the Oakland Athletics in '74 in the first all-California matchup; the Yankees in '77 (featuring Reggie Jackson's three-homer output in the decisive Game 6); and then again to the Yankees in '78. Fear not, the Dodgers would avenge those losses by defeating the Yankees in '81 and the A's in '88 -- you may know of that series for no other reason than Kirk Gibson's iconic home run in Game 1.After 1988, the Dodgers would not make another World Series appearance until 2017, instead enduring an at-times embarrassing stretch of mediocrity. The franchise's fortunes started to change when Mark Walter purchased the franchise from Frank McCourt, later installing Andrew Friedman (the architect of the Tampa Bay Rays) as his top baseball operations executive.\nIn the years since, the Dodgers have become a staple of October, winning 12 of the last 13 division titles. They made it back to the World Series in 2017, losing against the Houston Astros in seven -- a loss the Dodgers took exception to in light of Houston's improper sign-stealing scheme -- and then lost in five games to the Boston Red Sox the following year. It wasn't until 2020, a World Series unlike any other because of the COVID-19 global pandemic, that the Dodgers slayed their postseason demons.The Dodgers won a \"regular\" World Series last fall, defeating their old rival, the Yankees, in five games. That series was memorable, despite its abbreviated and one-sided result, because it represented Shohei Ohtani's first World Series appearance as well as an unforgettable walk-off grand slam by a hobbled Freddie Freeman -- a scene reminiscent of Gibson's home run in '88. \"I played the whole game though,\" Freeman joked to reporters after being met with the comparison.\n            ",

The Chargers trailed the Colts by 20 points at halftime last week before ultimately losing in a 38-24 final. They gave up more than 400 yards and turned the ball over twice in that setback. Minnesota is dealing with a key injury of its own in quarterback J.J. McCarthy (ankle), but veteran backup Carson Wentz is making his fifth start of the season.

Star guard Tyrese Haliburton not only averaged 18.6 points per game, but he also added 9.2 assists. His absence looms large heading into the season, and Myles Turner was lost in free agency. Oklahoma City only shot 44.2% from the floor and 25% from 3-point range in its season opener on Tuesday, while holding Houston to similar numbers.

Nuggets star Nikola Jokic missed one of those games, but he averaged 35.5 points per game in the other two contests. Jokic has posted a triple-double in each of his past two openers and has three career triple-doubles on opening night. The model has Jokic coming up one assist shy of a triple-double on Thursday night, but Denver is covering the spread 56% of the time. Bet it at bet365 here:\nLooking for Week 8 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Thursday.

Los Angeles has allowed at least 27 points in three straight weeks behind a struggling run defense. The Chargers are 28th in the NFL in yards per rush allowed (5.1), and the Vikings could have Aaron Jones (hamstring) back, as the Vikings activated his 21-day window to return from IR this week. Jordan Mason has run well this season with and without Jones in the lineup, so containing the run could be a problem for the Chargers.

There are a lot of distractions that come with being the reigning champions hosting the first game of a new NBA season. But on Thursday, the Thunder will be on the road, and the NBA wasted no time in building the NBA Finals rematch when Oklahoma City travels to Indiana. The Pacers will play their first game without Tyrese Haliburton (Achilles), so that will be a tough adjustment for Indiana. The Thunder were the No. 1 team in the NBA against the spread last season (53-25-4), covering in 68% of games during the regular season, and after failing to cover in their opener, the model doesn't see that happening in back-to-back contests.

The Nuggets finished two games ahead of the Warriors last season, with 50 wins compared to Golden State's 48. Denver has the fourth-best winning percentage (.469) as an underdog last season, which creates a profitable outcome.

    "body": "\n        PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Eagles offensive line hasn't played at the elite level the organization is accustomed to. How can a unit with two All-Pro offensive tackles, a Pro Bowl left guard, and a Pro Bowl center struggle as significantly as this unit has through seven games?Injuries have something to do with it. That's the case for Landon Dickerson anyway. Dickerson admitted the obvious this week, as the Pro Bowl left guard has been battling injuries that have hindered him throughout the season. From training camp, Dickerson was battling injuries as he had surgery to repair meniscus cleanup on his right knee. He returned in time for the season opener, but suffered a back injury in September.Then Dickerson suffered an ankle injury earlier this month, as he missed the Week 6 loss to the New York Giants. On top of all these injuries, Dickerson had knee surgery after the Super Bowl in February. \n\n        \n            \n                Inside Brandon Graham's decision to come back to Eagles, what drove vet to return?\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"After 13 surgeries, I'm not managing much,\" Dickerson said in regards to managing his injuries. Dickerson was also a limited participant in Wednesday's practice with back and ankle injuries. \"It's shitty,\" Dickerson said. \"You start off the year having surgery, and you don't get back to 100%. You try and go play, you're getting messed up again. And you kind of get into a cycle of that. But yeah, it's just football.\"Dickerson has battled more than injuries this season, and it's affecting his performance on the field. He's allowed three sacks in 158 pass-blocking snaps this season and a career-high 8.2% pressure rate allowed per drop back. The Eagles offensive line has also struggled in the wake of Dickerson's injury, allowing 21 sacks (6th in NFL and a sack rate of 9.7% -- 27th). \nThe run game has struggled to get going as well. Not only do the Eagles average 3.3 yards per carry (31st in NFL), but they have just a 39.3% conversion rate running the ball on third down (29th). The 1.06 yards before contact is also 23rd in the league, a product of Saquon Barkley averaging just 3.3 yards per carry. This is what makes Dickerson's injuries all the more frustrating. He was just starting to get back to being the dominant player he was before the ankle injury was another setback. He's expected to play against the Giants this week. \"I had definitely started feeling better in that game,\" Dickerson said. \"Yeah, then you end up having that, and you go back and do it all over again.\"\nNot only is Dickerson battling injuries, but there's a chance he may be moving positions this week. Cam Jurgens suffered a knee injury in Sunday's win over the Vikings, and Brett Toth filled in at center. Dickerson has played center at Florida State and Alabama, and has filled in there for the Eagles as an emergency option. That option may be available Sunday as Jurgens didn't practice to start the week, and is trending in the direction of not playing Sunday. The Eagles could go with Dickerson at center, or keep him at left guard and stick with Toth. \"Kind of whatever they think the best option is,\" Dickerson said. \"We always try to keep at least three guys who can play center on game day. So, I know Cam's (Jurgens) in that rotation, Brett (Toth), me. I know we got Drew Kendall. \n\"So kind of wherever they think getting the best five guys out there is.\"No matter what injuries Dickerson has, he'll battle through them. Dickerson admitted he's only at 70-75%, yet he'll manage. \"That's the thing. It's how you base your 100%,\" Dickerson said. \"I base my 100% off where I can be at this time, not where I was at any point in life.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just one month ago, the Los Angeles Chargers were a popular pick to win the AFC.They were a perfect 3-0, having already knocked off the three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City in the season opener. They held a two-game lead in the AFC West and their defense had allowed just 50 points, the fourth fewest in the NFL up to that point.SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and Projection Model gave the Chargers a 64.7% chance to win the division, a 90.9% chance to make the playoffs and a 9.4% chance to reach the Super Bowl. But the last month has been unkind to Los Angeles. Jim Harbaugh & Co. have lost three of their last four games, including a defeat to the previously winless Giants. The Chargers' only victory over that time was a two-point win over the hapless Dolphins. Los Angeles' once-stout defense went from allowing 16.7 points a game over the first three games to 28.3 over the last four.You can bet Chargers vs. Vikings at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:And now, as the Chargers (4-3) enter Week 8, their Thursday Night Football contest against the Minnesota Vikings (3-3) carries more weight than it looked like it was going to carry a month ago. After its losing streak, Los Angeles now is one game behind the Broncos (5-2) in the AFC West, and its chances to make the playoffs, win the AFC and Super Bowl have all dropped considerably since Week 3.Chargers' chance to ...Through Week 3TodayMake playoffs90.9%56.4%Win division64.7%11.9%Win AFC9.4%3.8%Win Super Bowl4.0%1.6%According to the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the Chargers will be playing in the biggest swing game of Week 8. They enter the week with a 56.4% chance to make the playoffs. If they beat Minnesota, that probability increases to 65.2%. But if they were to lose, that number crashes to 44.8%.That hypothetical 20.4% drop is the biggest of any NFL team this week.TeamChance to make playoffs with Week 8 winChance to make playoffs with Week 8 lossDifferentialChargers65.2%44.8%20.4%Cowboys41.0%20.9%20.1%49ers74.5%54.5%20.0%Patriots86.3%67.3%19.0%Bears56.7%38.0%18.7%Los Angeles' struggles have coincided with quarterback Justin Herbert's struggles. Through the first three games he had a 6-to-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio with a passer rating of 105.5. Over the last four games, he has a 7-to-5 ratio with a rating of 87.3.The Chargers are 3.5-point favorites over the Vikings.\nMinnesota has a lot riding on this game as well. The NFC North is arguably the deepest division in the league and the Vikings occupy the basement, two games behind the division-leading Packers (4-1-1) in the loss column. Of Minnesota's 11 remaining games, seven are against teams that are currently above .500. According to the SportsLine Projection Model, that's the toughest remaining strength of schedule in the league, so there is urgency for the team to capitalize on winnable games.Quarterback Carson Wentz is set to start once again for the Vikings, who could get J.J. McCarthy back soon from an ankle injury. Wentz is 7-0 in his career on Thursday night, which is the most wins without a loss by any quarterback since 2000. However, he is coming off his worst game of the season, throwing two interceptions in a 28-22 loss to the Eagles.\n            ",

The Chargers defense has caught some breaks in matchups, watching Xavier Worthy go down immediately in Week 1, getting Jaxson Dart's debut, etc,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"Last week it all fell apart against a strong Colts offense, but it was the third straight game allowing 27+ points and at least three offensive TDs, with one coming against a broken Miami offense. I see the Vikings putting up points here and getting a backdoor cover if needed, and I don't see the Chargers running away with the game with an unreliable rushing attack.\" Back the Vikings at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Pacers +7.5 vs. Thunder (-110)\"Rematch time from the Finals last June only now the Pacers don't have Tyrese Haliburton, who went down in Game Seven with a ruptured Achilles and will miss this entire season,\" SportsLine's legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"We don't, however, expect Indiana to completely disappear, as the Andrew Nembhard-Bennedict Mathurin backcourt remains potent, F Pascal Siakam continues to perform at an All-Star level, and Rick Carlisle can rotate three bigs (Isaiah Jackson, Jay Huff, and James Wiseman) in the post. As for OKC, it wears a big target this season, as Houston reminded in the double OT on opening night.\" Back the Pacers at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nUnder 233.5 points in Warriors vs. Nuggets (-105)Denver will be making its season debut, but we have seen Golden State in action already. The Warriors opened their 2025-26 campaign on Tuesday with a 119-109 win over the Lakers and they'll be looking to dictate the tempo again at home on Thursday. Steve Kerr has dialed the tempo down with a veteran-laden roster and Golden State was 17th in pace last season but top-eight in points allowed (110.5) and defensive rating (111.7).

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Chargers host the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday Night Football to open the Week 8 NFL schedule. The Chargers have gone from looking like arguably the best team in football after the first three weeks to now a team that may fight its way into the postseason. The Chargers (4-3) have lost three of their last four games and are coming off a 38-24 loss to the Colts in a game they trailed 23-3 at halftime. The Vikings (3-3) are coming off a 28-22 loss to the Eagles. Kickoff from SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Calif., is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. The Chargers are 3.5-point favorites, according to the latest Vikings vs. Chargers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 44.5. Justin Herbert's over/under for total passing yards is 254.5, while Justin Jefferson's over/under for total receptions is 6.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Chargers vs. Vikings. Here's a closer look at available sportsbook promos on some of the top NFL betting sites, as well as the best betting apps that are available for Chargers vs. Vikings on Thursday Night Football, with instructions on how to claim each offer and where to bet NFL.Where to bet on Vikings vs. Chargers on Thursday Night FootballBrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets and 3 months of NBA League Pass free if your first bet winsJust click hereBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365CaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBSDYWFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash Just click hereThe DraftKings promo code, bet365 bonus code and FanDuel promo code all offer bonus bets after new users place a wager of $5 or more.

That just shows the ups and downs of an NFL season, and with Los Angeles at home against a Carson Wentz quarterbacked Vikings team, the model projects the Chargers to return to their winning ways. Justin Herbert threw for 420 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions last week against the Colts, and he leads the NFL with 1,913 passing yards this season. The Vikings are 2-2 in Wentz's four starts, with wins over a Bengals team quarterbacked by Jake Browning and the Browns with loss to the Eagles and Steelers. Beating the Chargers would be Wentz's most impressive win this season by far, and the model doesn't expect that to occur on Thursday. Los Angeles covers the spread in 50% of simulations.Over 44.5 pointsThe Over has hit in back-to-back Chargers games, and it's also cashed in all four of Wentz's starts for the Vikings. Wentz doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in fans to produce offensively, but he doesn't for sportsbooks either, which has actually made him an asset for Over betting due to how the books have lowered the numbers in his starts. He still has one of the best offensive minds in Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell orchestrating the offense, which has led to the Vikings averaging 28 points in Wentz's four starts with at least 21 points in all four contests. This matchup is filled with big-play receivers on both sides, such as Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, Ladd McConkey and Keenan Allen. The Chargers are averaging 26.5 ppg over their last two contests.  Once again, the Vikings' game has one of the lower over/under totals on the weekly NFL schedule, and the model likes the Over trend to continue, projecting the Over to hit in 52% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

One of his top NFL player props for Week 8 is Patriots quarterback Drake Maye going Over 19.5 completions (-122) versus Cleveland on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.\"The Cleveland Browns have a great rush defense and will likely force the Patriots to be more one-dimensional than they prefer. This is in spite of the fact that the Patriots will be playing from the lead. Look for the Browns to stymie the run and create their typical great pass rush, which will lead to Maye getting the ball out quickly in the short area. Don't expect Rhamondre Stevenson and company to be effective in this one and look for an already very accurate quarterback to pepper his targets as an extension of the run game.\" You can see all of Nejad's NFL picks here.You can also use the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets instantly:Top Week 8 NFL expert picks from Larry HartsteinA veteran CBS Sports and SportsLine NFL expert, Hartstein is on a sizzling 15-7 run on NFL spread picks, returning nearly $725 for $100 bettors. This week, he's backing the Bengals (-4.5) against the Jets.\"Joe Flacco isn't the only reason the Bengals have new life. Their defense has shown modest progress under first-year coordinator Al Golden, who has benched vets like Cam Taylor-Britt and Logan Wilson at the expense of promising young players. After having to face Jared Goff, Jordan Love and Aaron Rodgers in succession, Cincy now will prepare for Justin Fields or Tyrod Taylor.

For Green Bay vs. Pittsburgh on Sunday Night Football, Severance is backing the Steelers (+3.5) to cover at home.\"Generally not an early jumper on NFL, but I was definitely looking at this pro-Steelers right off the bat because Aaron Rodgers will be so fired up to light up the Packers like he's on an all-time ayahuasca trip. Bit surprised we got the hook this early in the week if not surprised overall that Pittsburgh is even getting a field goal at home unless I'm missing a TJ Watt injury or something (nope).

    "body": "\n        When Iowa landed Mark Gronowski out of the transfer portal, the Hawkeyes believed they had finally found a quarterback who could open up the passing game. That hasn't happened. Instead, the Iowa has increasingly relied on the other half of Gronowski's game -- his legs -- to move the ball.The former South Dakota State transfer and two-time FCS national champion is tied for the most rushing touchdowns (10) by an FBS quarterback this season, just one shy of the Iowa single-season record for a quarterback set by Wilburn Hollis in 1960.As Iowa heads into its rivalry matchup with Minnesota for the Floyd of Rosedale Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS, the focus will almost certainly be on running the football -- and perhaps giving Gronowski more opportunities to break off big gains.Most rushing TDs by a QB this season (FBS)PlayerTeamRushing TDsMark GronowskiIowa10Haynes KingGeorgia Tech10Cale HellumsArmy10Liam SzarkaAir Force9Alonza Barnett IIIJMU9The Hawkeyes' passing attack has been largely ineffective, leaving the offense with no choice but to rely on sustained ground effort. Gronowski has attempted 107 passes in the first four Big Ten games without a touchdown. Iowa ranks last among Power Four teams in yards per attempt (5.5) and fifth-worst in success rate on pass plays (41.1%).Meanwhile, Gronowski set an Iowa quarterback record with 130 rushing yards on nine carries in the 25-24 win against Penn State last week. Even without his 67-yard run, the longest by a Hawkeye this season, he still produced his best single-game rushing total at Iowa. The performance demonstrated his effectiveness when given opportunities to run, even as the coaching staff continues to manage his workload carefully.Gronowski's effectiveness on the ground is not new. At South Dakota State, he rushed for 1,767 yards over 55 starts, averaging 4.6 yards per attempt -- a skill set that Iowa has leaned on heavily this season.Against Minnesota, expect Iowa to rely on the run again. The Golden Gophers' secondary is opportunistic, but Iowa has struggled to stretch the field through the air, making a ground-first approach the most viable strategy to sustain drives. Nine of his 10 rushing touchdowns this season have come in goal-to-go situations, and his ability to gain yards on designed runs and scrambles has become central to Iowa's offense. \n        \n            \n                B1G Time: Overlook P.J. Fleck and Minnesota at your own peril, it's even worse than it looks at Wisconsin\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA step back  His carries were limited in the three games following a knee injury against Indiana in Week 5, which sidelined him late in that contest and likely made offensive coordinator Tim Lester more cautious. His average carries dropped from 14.5 per game against the first two Power Four opponents (Iowa State and Rutgers), to just 7.0 in the three games since the injury. Even against Penn State, Gronowski was kept to nine attempts, suggesting a cautious but gradually increasing trust in his rushing ability, though he stated after the game he didn't feel \"limited\" at all against the Nittany Lions. Even with the injury and limited carries, Gronowski continues to set milestones. He has recorded a rushing touchdown in seven straight games, a streak not matched by a Big Ten quarterback since Denard Robinson at Michigan in 2011. He is also the winningest starting quarterback in NCAA history, with 54 career victories -- 49 at South Dakota State and five at Iowa -- demonstrating sustained success across both FCS and FBS levels.Most career wins by starting QB (NCAA history)PlayerTeam(s)WinsMark GronowskiSouth Dakota State (FCS), Iowa54Cullen FinnertyGrand Valley State (Division II)51Kellen MooreBoise State50\"Where do you wanna start?\" Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck said when asked what challenges Gronowski presents. \"He runs the ball like a running back, throws it like a quarterback. He's really, really intelligent. ... He's like a running back playing quarterback. If you could take Darius (Taylor) and Drake (Lindsey) and put them together, that would be him. I think that's kinda the best way to describe him.\"Despite the Hawkeyes' continued struggles through the air, Gronowski's legs, combined with a physical offensive line, have allowed Iowa to move the ball. It is on pace for its most productive scoring attack in five years, showing that even in a limited passing game, the offense can generate points when built around a quarterback capable of producing on the ground.\"He's a winner. All he's done is win,\" Fleck said. \"And I think that should never be lost on anybody. ... You can tell everything he does is really detailed, really fundamentally sound. He's gritty, he's tough and he understands situational football. He's a really good football player and knows the game within the game, and that's a scary combination.\"As Iowa looks to continue its success against Minnesota, much of the Hawkeyes' fortunes in the 119th all-time meeting will hinge on whether Gronowski can turn his legs into decisive plays.Where to watch Iowa vs. Minnesota Date: Saturday, Oct. 25  | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Kinnick Stadium -- Iowa City, IowaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime \n            ",

The club has released a video of Lionel Messi signing a contract extension at the home of their new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, which is set to open ahead of the 2026 season. Messi's contract was set to expire at the end of the current MLS season, but both parties were hopeful of coming to an extension. The extension will run through 2028, according to reporters citing the club, keeping the Argentine number 10 in pink well after the 2026 World Cup, which will be taking place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nAfter Messi just completed one of the best MLS regular season campaigns in club history with 29 goals and 19 assists (including secondary assists), he has shown that he still has plenty to give to the Herons, and this news is quite a boon ahead of their playoff run. With Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets retiring at the end of the season, things will look a little different at the club when Miami Freedom Park opens next campaign, but as long as Messi is on the roster, they'll compete for silverware around the league.\nMessi has already won the 2023 Leagues Cup and the 2024 Supporters' Shield with Miami, and he can keep up an annual tradition of winning a trophy with the club if he can lead the Herons to the first MLS Cup title in their history.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nEvery Thursday during the college football season, I'll release my favorite spots to bet for the upcoming week. A great example of a \"spot\" play is Vanderbilt's upset over Alabama last season. The Commodores were returning home after two straight road losses, while Alabama was coming off an emotional win over No. 2 Georgia. Vanderbilt won the game outright as a 23-point underdog. We will see more opportunities like this once the season gets going based on travel, results, and injuries. Just for clarification, I'll always mention if I bet the game personally. Sometimes, I will like the spot for a certain team but my numbers may not see enough value to make it an official play. Here are three strong betting spots for Week 9: Iowa State Cyclones -2.5 vs. BYU Cougars \nBYU is in one of the toughest spots of the season on Saturday. The Cougars are coming off two hard-fought, emotional wins after beating Arizona in overtime and upsetting rival Utah at home. Now BYU has to face a rested Iowa State squad in one of the toughest places to play in the Big 12. The bye week couldn't have come at a better time for the reeling Cyclones. Iowa State lost both starting cornerbacks for the season then dropped two games in a row to Cincinnati and Colorado. While I do believe BYU is the better overall team, late October is when bettors can really take advantage of these situational spots. I think we have one here, and that's why we see 5-2 Iowa State favored over 7-0 BYU. The other thing to watch here is I expect Iowa State to get its running game going and have success on the ground. BYU ranks 53rd against the run, which looks impressive on paper. However, in their last three games against Utah, Arizona and West Virginia, the Cougars allowed an average of 183 rushing yards. All three teams ran for 150+ yards against BYU. I like the Cyclones to take care of business at home and would lay under a field goal. South Carolina Gamecocks +12.5 at Alabama Crimson Tide\nThis is an interesting spot for Alabama. The Crimson Tide are coming off four straight games against ranked teams with wins over Georgia, Vanderbilt, Missouri and Tennessee. Now Alabama travels to struggling South Carolina before a bye week with LSU on deck. This is by far the Crimson Tide's worst spot of the season. If Alabama is going to get caught overlooking an opponent, it will likely be on Saturday. The problem for the Gamecocks right now is the offense can't score points. Then again, when a team hires Mike Shula to be its offensive coordinator, that is an inevitable outcome. Shula's predictable play calling has led to South Carolina averaging just 11 points versus SEC opponents not named Kentucky. Things won't get any easier on Saturday against Alabama's defense. However, Shane Beamer excels in this situation. For whatever reason, his teams perform better in the bigger underdog role. South Carolina is 3-1 ATS as an underdog of over nine points the last two seasons, including a 27-25 loss at Alabama as 21-point dogs. As we get deeper into October, betting certain spots can be profitable. This looks like one of them to me. It's really tough for college kids to get up for games five weeks in a row. There is no question that Alabama is the better team here, but South Carolina is getting the Tide at the perfect time right before their bye week. Arkansas Razorbacks -1 vs. Auburn Tigers\nAs we approach Halloween, one thing I look for are teams with losing records that are still playing hard. Arkansas is a perfect example. The Razorbacks are a disappointing 2-5 this season, although they have lost four games by six points or less. Since Bobby Petrino took over for the fired Sam Pittman, Arkansas lost by three points to ranked teams Tennessee and Texas A&M while averaging 36.5 points per game. The problem for the Razorbacks has been a defense that can't stop anyone, and that has led to the close losses. Another hard luck team this season is Auburn. The Tigers have lost four straight to Oklahoma, Texas A&M, Georgia and Missouri. All four games were close, but unlike Arkansas, the Tigers averaged just 13 points in the losses. The difference for me entering this matchup is Arkansas already fired its coach and the kids are still playing hard. Meanwhile, Hugh Freeze is under a lot of pressure at Auburn right now, and this is a team that thought it was in position to compete for a playoff spot. Instead, the Tigers are a disappointing 3-4. I wonder if the players will be able to get up for a 2-5 Arkansas team on the road this week. I trust Taylen Green and Arkansas' offense more in this game, and outside of the Notre Dame debacle, the Hogs had a chance to win every game this season. If a couple of bounces went their way, the Razorbacks could be sitting at 6-1 right now. I think the Hogs finally get a late stop and win a close game at home.  \n            ",

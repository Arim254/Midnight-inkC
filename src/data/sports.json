    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim is more than a grappler. Heading into Saturday's UFC Fight Night, many thought Bonfim's submission skills would carry him to victory. Instead, he chewed up Randy Brown's leg before knocking him out with a brutal knee in the second round from Las Vegas.Bonfim systematically disassembled Brown, who was the more reputable striker. Bonfim immediately got to work, targeting Brown's lead leg with calf strikes. The damage added up quickly as Brown started switching stances and preemptively picking his leg up off the mat. What happened early in Round 2, however, sparked more dialogue than the good work preceding it.Bonfim landed a clinch knee that took him off his feet and  dropped Brown. Bonfim quickly stood up and ran over to deal additional  blows to his grounded opponent. Before he could, referee Mark Smith  intervened and waved it off. Brown protested the stoppage, but it's unlikely he would've fared better had the fight continued. \nUpon closer inspection, it appeared that Brown was knocked out and  awoke once he hit the mat. After Bonim landed the knee, Brown slowly  fell backwards, his head smacking against the mat. He looked dazed as he  slowly raised his hands to block Bonfim's inevitable incoming barrage.  \nPost-fight, Bonfim reflected on his performance before calling out former UFC welterweight title challenger Colby Covington.\"We knew the calf was something. We knew to punish that, and that the knee would show up,\" Bonfim said, according to Portuguese interpreter Fabiano Buskei. \"Colby, stop running. Stop running away. We are the Bonfim brothers. Give me the chance to knock you out of the rankings... I'm going to retire him.\"It was a bittersweet evening for the Bonfim brothers. While Gabriel scored one of his biggest wins to date, Ismael wasn't so lucky. \nChris Padilla knocked out the elder Bonfim brother after wearing him out. Gabriel Bonfim improved to 18-1 with a three-fight winning streak. Ismael Bonfim dropped to 20-5 and has lost three of his last four.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Will the ACC's best team please stand up? In fact, if you're out there, go ahead and give the College Football Playoff selection committee a nudge, too.No. 14 Virginia and No. 15 Louisville -- the league's two torchbearers in the first College Football Playoff Rankings -- lost on Saturday night to Wake Forest and Cal, respectively, sending the ACC Championship race into further disarray coming down the stretch. No. 17 Georgia Tech was idle following its first loss of the season at NC State, while No. 18th Miami handled Syracuse after previously tumbling outside of the top 10 after its second setback in three weeks.It was so disappointing for Louisville against Cal that a chorus of boos rained down from the Cardinals' home fans at the end of regulation after a possession that started at midfield in the final seconds of the fourth quarter went nowhere. In overtime, Louisville was called for a chop block on its first possession that wiped away a first down and led to a field goal before Cal won it on fourth-and-goal with a touchdown pass from freshman QB Jaron Keawe Sagapolutele.\nThe metrics point to the league being a mixed bag at best this season, punctuated by a 5-4 Duke team -- a 37-34 loser at UConn in Week 11 -- still having a chance to reach the league title game with a couple wins the remainder of the month.How'd we get here after Florida State opened with a win over Alabama and Clemson outlasted LSU to spike the early top 15 before the wheels came off for both?The selection committee slotted three Big 12 teams ahead of the ACC's first ranked team in this week's initial poll and placed two-loss Notre Dame, who fell to Miami in the season opener, eight spots ahead of the Hurricanes despite having the same record.\nIt's clear the selection committee is not fond of the ACC this season. And this should not be surprising.There's five automatic qualifiers in the 12-team playoff bracket -- the five, highest-ranked conference champions based on the selection committee's final top 25. Theoretically, if there's a Group of Five team -- or multiple squads -- slotted higher than the ACC's victor at season's end, they would get in along with champions from the SEC, Big Ten and Big 12.Virginia's strength of schedule coming into Saturday's loss to Wake Forest was 85th nationally, just behind Georgia Tech. Louisville's slate was 56th and Miami's was considered the best in the conference at No. 28. The Hurricanes also rank seventh in game control following their win over Syracuse, but they're too far back of the current pack at No. 18 in the rankings.\nBy comparison, all seven SEC teams still in playoff contention rank 25th or better in strength of schedule and in the Big Ten, the strength of schedules average for the six teams expected to be ranked on Tuesday is 35.1.Say what you want, but who you play matters and strength of schedule is supposed to matter more this season than it ever has in the eyes of the selection committee.The argument's easy for another addition from the SEC or Big Ten taking the ACC's perceived one-bid lock, but SOS is a dilemma for those in the Group of Five. There's currently six teams vying for the Group of Five's playoff auto-bid -- North Texas, Navy, USF, Tulane, James Madison and San Diego State. \nNone of these teams were ranked by the selection committee in the first poll, but one could justify a 12-win, Sun Belt champion JMU or a 12-win, Mountain West champion San Diego State as a better option than what the ACC could end up with at the podium in Charlotte the first weekend of December. JMU would be riding an 11-game winning streak with its only loss coming at Louisville in Week 2, while San Diego State would also have a comparable streak, including victories over five bowl-bound opponents if the Aztecs win out.Top of ACC standings after Week 11TEAMRECORDNo. 14 Virginia8-2, 5-1 (85th SOS)No. 17 Georgia Tech8-1, 5-1 (84th)No. 24 Pittsburgh7-2, 5-1 (86th)SMU7-3, 5-1 (64th)Duke5-4, 4-1 (70th)No. 15 Louisville7-2, 4-2 (56th)No. 18 Miami (FL)7-2, 3-2 (28th)Virginia has three overtime wins this season over Florida State, Louisville and North Carolina. And that's part of what apparently made the resume stand out above others in the conference to the selection committee last week.\"Look, if you win, it's a positive. Wins matter. And if you lose, we evaluate what type of loss that is,\" selection committee chair Mack Rhoades said last week. \"Again, Virginia, that's a great overtime win, when you talk about going on the road and beating a quality -- a really well-coached Louisville team. Virginia is a really good football team. Coach Scott has done a great job. Again, they've got more games to play.\"Georgia Tech could close the book on any noise concerning the ACC being deserving of a bid or not to its champion if the Yellow Jackets run the table. That would include victories over two ranked teams in Pitt and Georgia, and likely another top-25 team in the league title game.If Brent Key's team gets through that gauntlet, they're going to be in the bracket and perhaps even receive a first-round home game. What's more likely is more unpredictability in the conference through the end of the month with perceived favorites going down and there being a multi-team tie at the top with multiple losses going into the final weekend of the campaign.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There were a couple near upsets in the Big Ten that would've tossed College Football Playoff projections into a jumbled mess, but unbeaten Indiana and one-loss Oregon prevailed on their final possessions against Penn State and Iowa, respectively, away from home to keep pace behind top-ranked Ohio State.Texas Tech's 29-7 destruction of BYU gets the Red Raiders back on track as leaders of the Big 12 and puts the Cougars' upcoming game against Cincinnati as a potential winner-take-all chance to play the Joey McGuire's team in the conference title game. However, Texas Texas must win out, too, and the Big 12 has been anything but predictable this fall.The selection committee's first playoff rankings gave us an early inkling of this year's potential 12-team bracket, but remember, this poll is fluid with wild fluctuation expected over the next few weeks. Last year's Big 12 champion, Arizona State, did not appear in either of the playoff's first two top 25 rankings before getting hot and winning the conference.After Week 11, we're expecting five SEC teams, three from the Big Ten, Notre Dame, the ACC champion, the Big 12 champion and the Group of Five's highest-ranked team to fill out the expanded bracket.\nCollege Football Playoff Quarterfinals DateGame / LocationProjectionJan. 1 Rose BowlPasadena, Calif.(1) Ohio State vs. (8/9) WinnerJan. 1 Sugar BowlNew Orleans, La.(2) Texas A&M vs. (7/10) WinnerJan. 1 Orange BowlMiami, Fla.(3) Indiana vs. (6/11) WinnerDec. 31 Cotton BowlArlington, Texas(4) Alabama vs. (5/12) WinnerFirst roundDate LocationProjectionWinner facesDec. 19 or 20Autzen StadiumEugene, Ore.(8) Oregon vs. (9) Notre Dame(1) Ohio StateDec. 19 or 20Jones AT&T StadiumLubbock, Texas(7) Texas Tech vs. (10) Texas(2) Texas A&MDec. 19 or 20Vaught-Hemingway StadiumOxford, Miss.(6) Ole Miss vs. (11) Georgia Tech(3) IndianaDec. 19 or 20Sanford StadiumAthens, Ga.(5) Georgia vs. (12) North Texas(4) AlabamaDon't see your team? Check out Brad Crawford's complete bowl projections.Projected College Football Playoff Field breakdown1. Ohio State (projected Big Ten champion): Will the Buckeyes have two Heisman finalists this season? Julian Sayin and Jeremiah Smith's performance at Purdue should get both of them invites to New York. Ohio State is the nation's best, most complete team and it's not particularly close.2. Texas A&M (projected SEC champion): Every week, Mike Elko's boys play angry. The Aggies did it again in Week 11, and now they're off to their best single-season start since 1992 with three games left to get to 12-0 before their trip to Atlanta. Keep an eye on that finale at Texas in a few weeks for this squad.3. Indiana: Welcome to New York, Fernando Mendoza. With no timeouts and 80 yards to go, the Hoosiers star quarterback cemented his trip to the Heisman ceremony with a drive for the ages at Penn State. Mendoza's 7-yard toss to a leaping Omari Cooper in the back of the end zone extended Indiana's winning streak to 10 this season and puts the Hoosiers two wins away from locking in a berth in the Big Ten title game.4. Alabama: No worries, Crimson Tide. Alabama didn't know what to expect out of a Brian Kelly-less LSU team, but a touchdown pass from Ty Simpson to Ryan Williams just before halftime sucked the air out of the balloon for the Tigers' upset chances. Alabama is wins over Oklahoma and Auburn away from getting to the league championship game with an opportunity to seize the No. 2 seed.5. Georgia: Fueled by three touchdown passes from Gunner Stockton and Nate Frazier's 100-plus yard outing on the ground, Georgia took Mississippi State behind the woodshed in its own backyard. Fresh off its first SEC win in a couple seasons, Mississippi State trailed by 17 points at halftime and was out-classed by one of the league's top teams.6. Ole Miss: The Rebels got a breather at home against The Citadel, dismantling the Bulldogs without any hiccups ahead of next week's battle against Florida. With two more wins, Ole Miss finishes 11-1 and will await its first-round opponent at home, unless there's chaos ahead of Lane Kiffin's program at the top of the SEC.7. Texas Tech (projected Big 12 champion): If the Red Raiders can turn field goals into touchdowns inside the red zone the rest of the way, there's nothing to worry about for the Big 12's most talented team. Saturday's blowout victory over previously unbeaten BYU knocks the Cougars from this week's projection, but these teams could meet again in a couple of weeks.8. Oregon: Afer Iowa took the lead on a 12-play, 93-yard touchdown drive with 1:51 to play, the defending Big Ten champions executed their 2-minute drill to near perfection, capped by Atticus Sappington's game-winning 39-yard field goal at Kinnick Stadium. Three more wins for the Ducks and they'll be back in the playoff, but a loss to USC or Washington coming up could complicate matters.9. Notre Dame: With Navy quarterback Blake Horvath unavailable as a late scratch, the Fighting Irish took advantage of the undermanned Midshipmen and raced their way to their seventh straight win. Given Notre Dame's No. 10 ranking in the selection committee's first poll and the likelihood this team finishes 10-2, the No. 9 seed feels right projecting out a few weeks from now.10. Texas: Idle with an extra week to prepare for a season-defining showdown at Georgia, Texas has played itself back into the playoff mix with three straight SEC wins. We're projecting a split against the Bulldogs and the finale against Texas A&M, which should put the Longhorns in the playoff as a three-loss (last) team (in). A potential Texas at Texas Tech first-round game would feed families in the Lonestar State.11. Georgia Tech (projected ACC champion): Wake Forest's upset win at Virginia leaves the ACC without a single unbeaten team in conference play exiting Week 11, which pushes Georgia Tech back to the ACC's projected champion slot ... for the time being. The Yellow Jackets still need to handle their business against Boston College and Pitt over the next few weeks to get to the league title game.12. North Texas (projected Group of Five champion): One of six teams in contention for the auto-playoff bid within the Group of Five following Tulane's win over Memphis on Friday night, North Texas is now one of the frontrunners in the American. Keep an eye on James Madison and San Diego State as well as potential victors from the Sun Belt and Mountain West. No Group of Five team was ranked inside the selection committee's first poll.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim and Randy Brown took very different paths to their first UFC Fight Night main event. Bonfim is a relatively new addition to the UFC roster; meanwhile, Brown celebrates a decade with the promotion in January. They collide on Saturday night at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.Bonfim (18-1) is defending his ranking, but arguably has more to prove than his opponent. Bonfim became a top 15 welterweight off a controversial decision win over longtime contender Stephen \"Wonderboy\" Thompson. Two years ago, nearly to the day, he was knocked out by Nicolas Dalby. A close decision win over Brown, an unranked fighter approaching 10 years with the promotion, won't do him much good. Bonfim needs a standout performance.\"If I let Brown control the distance and keep the fight standing, he has an advantage, that's his game. But not with me,\" Bonfim told CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter. \" I'm very comfortable exchanging punches. I know he's afraid and weary of my ground game.\"\n        \n            \n                Jon Jones rips Tom Aspinall's skills after UFC 321: 'His wrestling and jiu-jitsu are incredibly overrated'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown (20-6) is determined to make the most of his first main event. He's a promising contender, but every time he builds steam, his momentum gets cut short by guys like Belal Muhammad, Jack Della Maddalena and Vicente Luque. But all that experience has given him a level head. Brown is coming off a KO win over Dalby, the only person to beat Bonfim, but he isn't putting much stock in it. Brown knows exactly what Bonfim did wrong, but he can't guarantee he'll make those mistakes again. \"I know exactly what he lost that fight and what happened. I can't assume he's in that same place. He was pushed, overwhelmed, got tired, and was stopped...\" Brown told CBS Sports. \"I can't bank on him making those same mistakes. For all I know, he's in the best shape of his life, and when he shows up he'll be ready to do 10 rounds.\" \nBelow is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event. UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavorite Underdog Weight classGabriel Bonfim -190Randy Brown +160Welterweight  Joseph Morales -420  Matt Schnell +330  FlyweightUros Medic -150  Muslim Salikhov +125  WelterweightIsmael Bonfim -195Chris Padilla +165  LightweightRicky Simon -180Raoni Barcelos +150BantamweightMarco Tulio -185  Christian Leroy Duncan +155  Middleweight UFC Fight Night viewing information Date: Nov. 8 | Start time: 7 p.m. ET (main card) Location: UFC Apex -- Las Vegas TV channel: ESPN+ Prediction Gabriel Bonfim vs. Randy Brown: Don't let Bonfim's ranking fool you; he has something to prove. Many believe \"Wonderboy\" beat Bonfim. Dalby knocked him out. They were Bonfim's two most experienced opponents. Brown is another such veteran, having faced world-class competition for over a decade. He's fully capable of exploiting whatever holes Bonfim gives him, especially should he wilt over five rounds. Skill-wise, I lean towards Bonfim. He has fantastic submissions, judicious wrestling, and responsible striking defense. Thompson outstruck Bonfim in totality, but their significant strike outputs were almost identical. \nLast year, Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos took down Brown four times. The year before that, Della Maddalena submitted Brown -- one of only two submission wins in the champ's 20-fight pro career. There are conditions we should acknowledge in those two fights: Brown still beat Dos Santos, and Della Maddalena locked in the rear-naked choke off a knockdown. The fight benefits Brown the longer it goes. Ultimately, Bonfim shines more where Brown struggles. The inverse isn't quite as true. I'll take Bonfim, hesitantly, by submission. Bonfim via SUB2\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LUBBOCK, Texas -- Texas Tech linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has become something of a celebrity around campus. Fans have started sporting his signature mustache in the stands, and his No. 10 jersey trails only Patrick Mahomes' No. 5 for most sported at Jones AT&T Stadium. Rodriguez's numbers have been sensational, and his stat line for No. 8 Texas Tech in a dominant 29-7 win against No. 7 BYU marked one of his best -- 14 tackles, a tackle for loss, an interception returned deep into opposing territory. He has shepherded the Red Raiders through a defensive transition, going from a good player on a bad defense last year to one of the best players in college football in 2025. \"The Heisman is given to the best football player, it's not given to the best quarterback,\" Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire said. \"They have awards for that. You can't say that Jacob Rodriguez, at his position, isn't playing the best at his position in the country, as elite and as good as anybody in the country.\" The last time a linebacker at Texas Tech was such a household name was when an undersized Hall of Famer from Pampa named Zach Thomas was making the calls. And during a historic win for the Red Raiders, Rodriguez's defense played one of the best games of the season. \nBYU's offense presents numerous challenges with its misdirection and option concepts. Dual-threat quarterback Bear Bachmeier also rarely goes down and was only sacked once by defensive tackle Lee Hunter. But while havoc plays came at a premium, it was down-to-down excellence that stood apart at Texas Tech. Eight players recorded at least four tackles with very few misses in space. Seven players combined for eight passes defended. Four players recorded quarterback hurries and four recorded a single tackle for loss each. On a day where the offense had struggles early, the defense and special teams kept them alive. Formally, Texas Tech doesn't keep track of attendance over the stadium capacity of 60,229, but every nook and cranny was packed. For most of the afternoon, though, it wasn't a loud crowd. Despite taking a two-score lead, nerves trumped emotion. \n\n        \n            \n                West Texas boom: Inside Texas Tech's bold all-in bet on NIL and the billionaire landman responsible\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut late in the third quarter, Rodriguez tipped a third-down pass from Bachmeier and returned it to the edge of the red zone. For the first moment of the afternoon, emotion flowed. One drive later, the Red Raiders finally got into the end zone for the second time and the party was on. \"We can rely on the defense,\" McGuire said. \"Anytime, no matter what's going on in football at any level, if you can play defense and run the football, you're going to have an opportunity to be in games.\" The results against BYU's highly touted running game were off the charts. The Cougars came into the matchup averaging 216 yards rushing per game. They mustered only 67 yards rushing on 2.5 carries against Texas Tech. Bachmeier was pushed to throw more in the second half, recording a career high 38 pass attempts, but the Cougars were held to only 3.9 yards per play. \nMcGuire came to Texas Tech after spending most of his career as a high school coach. While he isn't schematically tied to any system, defense and physicality has always been his calling card. There were questions about how he'd be able to build that kind of culture after transferring in several key defensive pieces. However, returners like Rodriguez and John Curry took it as a challenge. Everyone came to Lubbock for an opportunity to change everything. And after outlasting BYU, Texas Tech has formally completed the journey from a bottom 10 national defense to a top 10 unit. Texas Tech -- yes, Texas Tech -- has a championship level defense. \"We are so close,\" Rodriguez said. \"This is the most fun I've ever had playing football. It's not just offense, defense, special teams -- it's the whole team. Everybody cares about each other. We've got to be one of the closest teams in the country.\" \nWith the win, Texas Tech virtually clinches a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game for the first time in program history. Only games against struggling UCF and West Virginia teams remain. If the Red Raiders enter the postseason with only one loss, they can likely punch their ticket to the College Football Playoff -- win or lose. Rodriguez started his career as a quarterback at Virginia. He returned home to West Texas and switched positions, trusting the staff. After 10 games, Rodriguez has 91 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, three interceptions, seven forced fumbles and five passes defended. Will it be enough to receive an invitation to the Heisman Trophy ceremony in December? It remains to be seen. But it will be enough to compete for a championship. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest surprises in the new era of name, image, and likeness occurred less than 30 minutes before the deadline to withdraw from the 2025 NBA Draft passed. Alabama guard Labaron Philon, who most considered a likely late-first-round pick, elected to withdraw from the draft process during the 11th hour to return to school.Philon coming back not only gave Alabama a true building block for the 2025-26 season but also a chance for him to raise his stock and solidify himself as \"the guy\" after All-American guard Mark Sears departed the program. If Saturday was any indication of what's to come this season for the Crimson Tide, it is that Philon appears to be ready to meet the moment. Philon scored 25 points in No. 15 Alabama's 103-96 upset win over No. 5 St. John's at Madison Square Garden. Fifteen of his 25 points came after halftime. The Alabama star finished 10 of 17 from the floor and dished out three assists in just 29 minutes while dealing with foul trouble.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: North Carolina ticks up in Top 25 And 1 as Caleb Wilson stars in win over Kansas\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHighlight to end the halfPerhaps one of the biggest shots of Philon's college career came in the final two minutes of regulation. With the Crimson Tide up seven, Philon knocked down a step-back 3-pointer to extend the lead to double-digits, which put the game away for good. St. John's trailed for a majority of the second half before storming back to take a brief lead with 6:09 remaining.\nPhilon showed flashes last season of why he was one of the best prospects in the 2024 recruiting cycle. He averaged 10.6 points, 3.8 assists and 3.3 rebounds in 37 games. However, Philon started just 29 games and took a backseat role at times to other players on the roster, including Sears and Grant Nelson -- who both averaged more points per game than Philon.\nOats rescues roster againSince Nate Oats arrived at Alabama in 2019, he has consistently retooled his rosters. Oats had to replace three assistant coaches and seven of his top nine scorers ahead of the 2023-24 season when the Crimson Tide reached the Final Four for the first time in program history. Perhaps this offseason was one of his toughest challenges yet, as it's hard to replace a player like Sears, who is one of the most accomplished in program history.But getting Philon back was one of the biggest wins of Oats' coaching career, and it should give the Crimson Tide a real chance to compete for another berth to the Final Four if he keeps playing like this. As of this weekend, Alabama had the 10th-best odds (+430), per FanDuel, to reach the Final Four.\nOats has traditionally scheduled a tough slate of preseason games since his arrival to Tuscaloosa. Last year, the Crimson Tide played Purdue, Illinois, Houston, Oregon and North Carolina before SEC play began. Alabama will face No. 1 Purdue on Thursday with games vs. Illinois, Gonzaga and Arizona in nonconference play before the calendar flips to the new year and SEC play begins.    This win over St. John's should signal a few things ahead of his team's upcoming gauntlet: Alabama is still in the mix among the best teams in the sport, and Philon has a real case to leave his mark on the program and solidify himself as a potential lottery pick this summer.\n    \n                                        \n    Bama247.com features the best team and recruiting coverage of the Crimson Tide in the Alabama market.

    "body": "\n        Vergil Ortiz entered Saturday's fight with Erickson Lubin looking to not only prove a point, but to finally secure the big fight that had eluded him thus far in his promising young career. After less than two rounds of action, Ortiz found himself face-to-face with Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis as the two young fighters hyped up a potential massive 2026 clash.Despite knowing he needed to keep his back off of the ropes, Lubin was pushed backward by Ortiz from the opening bell. Ortiz didn't push the issue initially, picking his spots to throw jabs and then flurry briefly along the ropes.Lubin wanted to establish his own jab, but continually found himself with his back against the ropes. In the second round, that proved to be Lubin's undoing.Ortiz again pushed Lubin back into the ropes and began to connect with powerful shots. A series of sweeping right hands rocked Lubin, and Ortiz continued to fire punches until referee James Green was forced to jump in and stop the bout at the 1:30 mark of Round 2.\nOrtiz's trainer, Robert Garcia, rushed into the ring after the fight, providing a stool to Lubin after the stoppage.\n\"There wasn't much to evaluate,\" Ortiz said of his win. \"I just capitalized on his mistakes. I took as much information as I could and used it. ... I kind of felt [the finish would come], but I had to believe in myself and that's what I did.\"  Ennis was watching from ringside and tapped at his wrist, suggesting it was only a matter of time before he would meet Ortiz in a showdown of two of boxing's top young stars.\n\"I think this is the fight that has to happen, man,\" Ortiz said. \"I think this is it.\"Ortiz called Ennis to the ring, and Ennis was quick to accept the fight, calling for his promoter, Eddie Hearn, to provide the paperwork.\"It's the best fight in boxing,\" Ennis said. \"I'm going to show the world why I'm the best in the world. ... It don't matter. The time is now. It's the time, and I'll make you pay for everything [your team] is saying.\"\n            ",

Both are chasing Arsenal, who are atop the Premier League, but it's a chance to pick up points after the Gunners drew in an away trip to face Sunderland. It's been eight seasons since someone other than these two won the Premier League when Chelsea won in the 2016-17 season, but either dropping points at the Ethiad could bring us one step closer to ending their reign of dominance.How to watch Manchester City vs. Liverpool, oddsDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 11:30 a.m. ETLocation: Etihad Stadium -- Manchester, EnglandTV: USA | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Manchester City -111; Draw +290; Liverpool +270This isn't the moment where the title race will be officially over for the loser, but they'll certainly dig a hole that will be tough to get out of. City are seven points behind Arsenal in first, while Liverpool are a whopping eight points behind. It's been a strange start to the season -- Arne Slot's Reds aren't even in the top four currently,  as four teams are level on 18 points behind fourth-place Sunderland -- yes, you read that correctly. If Liverpool are going to pull themselves back into the Premier League title race, they'll need to find a way to stop Erling Haaland. Leading the league by a significant margin with 13 goals, the Norwegian has been automatic with 17 goals in 14 appearances in all competitions. Only two times this season has Haaland played in a match without finding the back of the net, which is incredible consistency.Haaland has also scored in his last two home appearances facing Liverpool, while City have been a dominant side at the Etihad. Following their loss to Tottenham on the opening day of the season, City have won their last five matches at home while only conceding two goals. Of course, with Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike coming to town, it will be tough to shut out this Liverpool side.\nConceding more goals and with fewer points than at this stage last season, Liverpool will want to take the momentum from beating Real Madrid in the Champions League midweek. History isn't on Liverpool's side, as despite having 20 titles in their history, they've failed to win back-to-back almost every time, except for a period when they won the league three times between 1982-84. Losing this game could close the door on any semblance of a title challenge, so the pressure will be on. That's nothing new to these teams, which will lead to a great match on the pitch.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        At 27 years old and with 23 professional fights on his resume, it's fair to ask if Vergil Ortiz still qualifies as a prospect. On Saturday, Ortiz will attempt to move further from prospect and closer to world champion when he faces former title challenger Erickson Lubin.Saturday's fight continues a run of Ortiz fights against tough opposition that began after muscle disorder rhabdomyolysis sidelined him from August 2022 to January 2024. Prior to that time on the sidelines, Ortiz was a red-hot up-and-comer, racking up tertiary titles at welterweight while struggling to find elite opponents.After Ortiz returned to action, he campaigned at 154 pounds, and after shaking off ring rust with first-round knockouts of Fredrick Lawson and Thomas Dulorme, Ortiz began to fight the kind of tricky opponents who are often avoided by fighters looking to climb their way to a title shot.\n        \n            \n                Vergil Ortiz Jr. faces another tough challenge in Erickson Lubin as champions continue to avoid him\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFirst was Serhii Bohachuk, who entered the fight after defeating Brian Mendoza. Ortiz was truly tested for the first time in his career in that fight, suffering two knockdowns but battling back to earn a majority decision victory.\nOrtiz followed the win over Bohachuk with a fight against Israil Madrimov, who gave Terence Crawford all he could handle one fight prior, losing a narrow decision to the elite pound-for-pound mainstay. Ortiz took a few rounds to work out Madrimov's awkward style, but ultimately took a decision win by wider margins than Crawford had managed.Lubin continues Ortiz's attempt to make his first shot at a world championship undeniable. Only two men have defeated Lubin as a professional: Jermell Charlo and Sebastian Fundora, both fighters who have held world championships. The fight with Fundora was a contender for Fight of the Year in 2022.Lubin has not been active in recent years. Since a somewhat controversial decision over Jesus Ramos in 2023, Lubin has only fought once, beating Ardreal Holmes Jr. in May.\nWith a win over Lubin, a title shot should be more or less guaranteed for Ortiz. The Ortiz team was already gunning for a shot at WBO champ Xander Zayas when negotiations never got over the finish line, leading to the Lubin fight. Zayas is now reportedly set to face WBA titlist Abass Baraou in a Jan. 31 unification bout. The timing could work out for Ortiz to get a shot at whoever emerges as unified champion sometime in mid-2026.The undercard is a bit weak on Saturday night. There are some matchups in the middleweight and super middleweight ranks featuring fighters looking to make a move up the divisional ranks. Darius Fulghum is set to take on David Stevens at 168 pounds. Fulghum suffered his first pro defeat in his last outing in May against Bektemir Melikuziev. Prior to that Fulghum won the first 14 bouts of his career. Plus, cruiserweights are set to throw down when Robin Sirwan Safar takes on Derick Miller Jr. Safar is a top prospect in the 200-pound division with an undefeated record at 18-0 with 13 KOs. He picked up the biggest win of his career in May 2024 with a decision over former light heavyweight king Sergey Kovalev.Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nOrtiz vs. Lubin fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookVergil Ortiz Jr. -1000 vs. Erickson Lubin +600, junior middleweightsDarius Fulghum -500 vs. David Stevens +350, super middleweightsRobin Sirwan Safar -700 vs. Derick Miller Jr. +425, cruiserweightsEric Priest -3500 vs. Esneiker Correa +1300, middleweightsAmari Jones -2500 vs. Shady Gamhour +1100, middleweightsOrtiz vs. Lubin viewing informationDate: Nov. 8 | Location: Dickies Arena -- Fort Worth, TexasStart time: 8 p.m. ET (main event ringwalks approximately 11:30 p.m. ET)Where to watch: DAZN (subscription required)PredictionLubin is a legit opponent for Ortiz, with good power and skills. Ortiz is, however, the better fighter overall. The past two fights have shown new dimensions to Ortiz while answering a lot of questions. Ortiz showed he can get up off the canvas and continue to fight for the win, not just to survive, against Bohachuk. And Ortiz proved he can handle a slick, awkward boxer against Madrimov.Lubin has enough power in both hands that he could score a knockout, but Ortiz can return fire and is the better boxer. This is all to say that Ortiz is a -1000 favorite for a reason.Lubin was stopped by both Charlo and Fundora. Though Ortiz has gone to decision in his two most recent fights (the only fights in his career to go the distance), this is the kind of fight where he can get back to stopping opponents. Pick: Vergil Ortiz via TKO8\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a quarterfinal being billed as an upset watch, the second seeded Washington Spirit flipped the script advancing to the semifinals after penalty kicks. Against the backdrop of a raucous hometown crowd at Audi Field in Washington, D.C., the Spirit managed to take control of the match early. In the first half of regulation, Louisville had no real answers to the Spirit's ball progression and often had none against their territorial counterpress. Racing spent the majority of the game pinned in their own half, and almost faced an early deficit, but a nifty set-piece goal by the Spirit was ruled offside, and an injury substitution to Spirit defender Gabby Carle almost reset the tempo, but not nearly enough. Still, Washington was dominant in almost every offensive and attacking stat by halftime, including possession, 73% to Louisville's minimal 27%, and practically double the pass attempts (302 to 109) and total touches (405 to 202).The shot selection for both sides was questionable though, and it took them a long time to find a goal in regulation with the Spirit's Gift Monday finally breaking the deadlock on a header.\nIt looked like that was going to be all that the Spirit needed, as they nursed their lead into stoppage time. But the drama was only getting started. Racing substitute Kayla Fischer provided a huge lift for Louisville, scoring the equalizer in stoppage time of regulation.\nExtra time offered plenty of high drama as the Spirit's injury list grew deeper into the game. Washington defender and U.S. women's national team player Tara McKeown was subbed out after making what may have been a game-saving tackle on Racing star striker Emma Sears. Eventually, the tired legs and fatigue led the way for penalty heroics. Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury emerged as the game-changer, stopping three consecutive penalty attempts by Racing Louisville players. It was almost how Washington drew up from last season. The group faced a testy No. 7 seed last year in Bay FC, came out victorious, and rode the momentum through to the final.\"Honestly, we've worked on this. We're prepared. Our kickers all executed. I did my job, and we're through in another round,\" Kingsbury told the broadcast after the game.\n\"You know, we'd love to get out of there at the end of regulation, but we came back from early injury to Gabby [Carle], late injury to Tara [McKeown]. A lot of adversity today, but really proud of the way that we stuck through it and came out with a victory.\"You could definitely tell we were tired. They were also really tired. They defended very well, honestly, the whole game, and we really executed perfectly up until about that 93rd minute. So, it's like, 'Hey, we're doing well, just keep fighting. Dig deep.' Credit to our subs off the bench, everyone really put in the shift today.\"Washington Spirit will face the winner of Portland Thorns FC and San Diego Wave FC. The two sides will play on Sunday. The winner will travel to Audi Field for the semifinal, where the stadium has become a fortress-like atmosphere.\n\"Oh yeah, it's great. We love our fans. It's electric in here. I honestly feel invincible, especially getting to take those penalties in front of our supporters section,\" Kingsbury said.\"I knew we were going to win just because we had them, and just giving us confidence. And it's a tough place to play for the opponents. So yeah, I wouldn't want to be the goalkeeper in front of that.\"CBS is the home of the NWSL Championship. The last two teams remaining from the NWSL playoffs will compete for the title on Saturday, Nov. 22, at PayPal Park in San Jose, California. Orlando Pride are recent semifinalists after defeating Seattle Reign on Friday; they await the winner of Kansas City Current vs. Gotham FC. You can watch the final live on Paramount+.\n            ",

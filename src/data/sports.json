    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season concluded Sunday night with the Seattle Seahawks holding up the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in franchise history. The Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots, 29-13, in Super Bowl LX, and Kenneth Walker III became the first running back this century to be named the game's MVP.But before either of those trophies was handed out, Bad Bunny took the stage to bring an epic Super Bowl halftime show performance. Benito is the most-streamed artist in the world and a 16-time Grammy nominee with six wins, including Album of the Year at the 2026 Grammys for \"DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS.\"When Bad Bunny took the stage, the Seahawks were up 9-0 in a mostly defensive game with just field goals on the board. Bad Bunny opened his set with \"Tití Me Preguntó,\" also performing \"Yo Perreo Sola\" and \"VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR.\"\nHe delivered an impressive set, complete with numerous dancers and props. The Super Bowl field transformed into a Puerto Rican town, featuring a market, food stands and even a wedding ceremony.\nDaddy Yankee's \"Gasolina\" and Don Omar's \"Dale\" were both represented, though neither singer appeared as a special guest.Lady Gaga was the first special guest to join Bad Bunny on stage, marking her third Super Bowl halftime performance. She sang \"Die With a Smile\" with a Spanish flair.\nRicky Martin was another special guest, performing \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.\" \nMultiple celebrities made background cameos, too, including actors Pedro Pascal and Jessica Alba.Bad Bunny played a video of himself winning a Grammy, handing the award to a young boy representing himself as a child.\"NUEVAYol,\" \"El Apagón\" and \"CAFé CON RON\" were also performed, and he closed with \"DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS.\"\nBad Bunny represented his roots by holding up the Puerto Rican flag. To end the performance, people playing various musical instruments and holding flags from multiple countries -- including the United States -- followed behind him. The headliner yelled, \"God Bless America,\" while \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" appeared on the jumbotron.He also held up a football that read, \"Together we are America,\" before spiking the ball in celebration.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFrom Super Bowl props like Jaxon Smith-Njigba first touchdown scorer (+500) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl 60 three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+280) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +390. As for Super Bowl MVP, Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into an all-or-nothing lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+330). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the divisional round and then got a red-zone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC title game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which matches Hunter Henry for the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

    "body": "\nSuper Bowl 60 will be the 10th rematch in the history of The Big Game as the New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. The Pats won their Super Bowl 49 meeting, and the winner of the first Super Bowl meeting is 6-3 all-time in the rematch. The Pats are the AFC's No. 2 seed after a 14-3 regular season and wins over the Chargers, Texans and Broncos in the 2026 NFL playoffs as New England has won six in a row overall. The Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed after also going 14-3, followed by postseason victories over the 49ers and Rams, as the Seahawks are on a nine-game win streak. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif, the home of the 49ers, where the Seahawks are 9-4 all-time. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds via DraftKings Sportsbook, which snaps a streak of eight straight Super Bowls in which New England is the favorite. The over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Both NFL lines of the spread and O/U have held steady since opening. Before making any Patriots vs. Seahawks picks, make sure to check out the Super Bowl 60 predictions from SportsLine NFL expert Brady Kannon.\nKannon rose to fame in 2011 when he captained a four-person team to win the Hilton NFL SuperContest (now the Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest).

The 8.7 ppg allowed by the Patriots in the 2026 NFL playoffs are the fewest through three playoff games since the Super Bowl-winning 2000 Ravens. On offense, Drake Maye who is +240 in the Super Bowl MVP odds, is the first quarterback to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason since the 1970 merger, and as a whole, the Pats finished the regular season in the top 3 in both points scored and yards gained. Additionally, the underdog has outright won in three straight Super Bowls and covered in five straight, with each of those the longest streaks in Big Game history. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverSeattle has played turnover-free ball over their last three games, and it is the only undefeated team (10-0) this season when committing 1 or fewer turnovers. Not giving the ball away keeps its No. 3 scoring offense on the field, and it's an explosive unit that leads the NFL in yards per pass completion (7.5). The other side of the ball ranks even better, topping the league, and No. 1 scoring defenses are 14-4 in the Super Bowl since 1970. The Seahawks are also the first team in a decade to rank in the top two in both yards per rush allowed (3.7, 1st) and yards per pass allowed (5.5, 2nd). In terms of the spread, Seattle is a league-best 14-5 ATS this season, while the Patriots are 0-7 straight up, and 1-5-1 ATS, in their last seven playoff games as underdogs without Tom Brady. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Seahawks  picksKannon has analyzed Seahawks vs. Patriots from every possible angle.

    "body": "\n        The final NFL DFS slate of the season arrives on Sunday at Levi's Stadium when the 2026 Super Bowl unfolds between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots (+4.5, 45.5 at DraftKings) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Some of the year's biggest daily Fantasy producers will be on display as Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was second among receivers in Fantasy points, while New England quarterback Drake Maye was third among quarterbacks. Meanwhile, Pats tight end Hunter Henry ranked fourth at his position in Fantasy points in the regular season.They'll be popular NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60, but who are the daily Fantasy sleeper picks who can create salary cap space to build a winning roster? Every Big Game sees a player come out of nowhere to make both real-life and Fantasy impacts. So, before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the 2026 Super Bowl, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.\nNow, McClure has turned his attention to the 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60 is Smith-Njigba, who is looking to cap a monster season where he led the NFL in receiving yardage at 1,793. After a relatively quiet week in the divisional round, he got back to his dominant ways against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, posting a 10-153-1 receiving line. By Super Bowl standards, the Patriots did not have an elite Fantasy defense against receivers this season, ranking 10th in Fantasy points allowed to that position group. They've also given up a touchdown to an opposing receiver in three of the past four games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Smith-Njigba to go Over 94.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp. The 32-year-old has become a secondary option this season, but he has seen his target share increase a bit in the NFL playoffs. That helped lead to a touchdown against the Rams in the NFC title game, and just five teams allowed more touchdowns to wideouts than the Pats in the regular season. With elite New England cornerback Christian Gonzalez likely shadowing Smith-Njigba for much of the game, there's a great chance that Kupp will get more opportunities on Sunday, all at a very affordable NFL DFS price. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Kupp to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in Patriots vs. Seahawks. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for the Super Bowl, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

For the first time in the history of the Super Bowl, each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup. New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. Seattle safety Nick Emmanwori (ankle) missed practice on Thursday but is not on the game injury report. New England's leader in sacks, LB Harold Landry (knee), was listed as questionable but is active.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye, the runner-up to the NFL MVP award, combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

The 60th edition of the big game took place at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It was second Super Bowl played at the stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, and the third played in the San Francisco Bay area.The last Super Bowl played at Levi's Stadium was Super Bowl 50 exactly 10 years ago, when the Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers, 24-10. Next season the Super Bowl will once again be in California, but in the Los Angeles area at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams. The game will take place on Valentine's Day, Sunday, Feb. 14, over Presidents' Day weekend.The Super Bowl has taken place in numerous cities and stadiums in its 60-year history and any area who wants to host must submit a proposal years in advance. The NFL owners vote on the city they want to select a few years before the game is scheduled. For instance, the 2028 game has already been awarded to Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. In the beginning of the game's existence, the process was not as democratic or transparent. \nOf all states, Florida has hosted the most Super Bowls at 17, followed by California at 12 and Louisiana at 11. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Can the Patriots protect Drake Maye well enough to beat Sam Darnold and Seattle?\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe two cities to host the most Super Bowls are Miami, Florida, and New Orleans, Louisiana, which both hosting 11. Super Bowl 59 in 2025 at the Caesars Superdome marked New Orleans' 11th time hosting. The 2020 Super Bowl at Hard Rock Stadium was Miami's 11th time hosting.Warm weather and domed stadiums are preferred, but there has been an outlier. Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey was the first outdoor \"cold-weather\" championship, although the 49-degree kickoff was relatively mild for the Northeast. There has not been a outdoor \"cold-weather\" venue selected since, however, the game has visited domed stadiums in Detroit, Indianapolis and Minneapolis. \nHere's a look at where every Super Bowl has taken place, along with the matchup and winner:Super BowlYearDateLocationMatchup (winner in bold)LXII2028TBDMercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GeorgiaTBDLXI2027Feb 14SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, CaliforniaTBDLX2026Feb 8Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CaliforniaSeahawks 29, Patriots 13LIX2025Feb 9Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana Eagles vs. ChiefsLVIII2024Feb 11Allegiant Stadium, Paradise, Las Vegas, NevadaChiefs vs. 49ersLVII2023Feb 12State Farm Stadium, Glendale, ArizonaChiefs vs. EaglesLVI2022Feb 13SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, CaliforniaRams vs. BengalsLV2021Feb 7Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, FloridaBuccaneers vs. 49ers LIV2020Feb 2Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, FloridaChiefs vs. 49ersLIII2019Feb 3Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GeorgiaPatriots vs. RamsLII2018Feb 4U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, MinnesotaEagles vs. PatriotsLI2017Feb 5NRG Stadium, Houston, TexasPatriots vs. FalconsL2016Feb 7Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CaliforniaBroncos vs. PanthersXLIX2015Feb 1State Farm Stadium, Phoenix, ArizonaPatriots vs. SeahawksXLVIII2014Feb 2MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New JerseySeahawks vs. BroncosXLVII2013Feb 3Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, LouisianaRavens vs. 49ersXLVI2012Feb 5Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, IndianaGiants vs. PatriotsXLV2011Feb 6AT&T Stadium, Arlington, TexasPackers vs. SteelersXLIV2010Feb 7Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, FloridaSaints vs. ColtsXLIII2009Feb 1Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, FloridaSteelers vs. CardinalsXLII2008Feb 3State Farm Stadium, Phoenix, ArizonaGiants vs. PatriotsXLI2007Feb 4Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, FloridaColts vs. BearsXL2006Feb 5Ford Field, Detroit, MichiganSteelers vs. SeahawksXXXIX2005Feb 6Alltel Stadium, Jacksonville, FloridaPatriots vs. EaglesXXXVIII2004Feb 1NRG Stadium, Houston, TexasPatriots vs. PanthersXXXVII2003Jan 26Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, CaliforniaBuccaneers vs. RaidersXXXVI2002Feb 3Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, LouisianaPatriots vs. RamsXXXV2001Jan 28Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, FloridaRavens vs. GiantsXXXIV2000Jan 30Georgia Dome, Atlanta, GeorgiaRams vs. TitansXXXIII1999Jan 31Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, FloridaBroncos vs. FalconsXXXII1998Jan 25Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, CaliforniaBroncos vs. PackersXXXI1997Jan 26Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, LouisianaPackers vs. PatriotsXXX1996Jan 28Sun Devil Stadium, Tempe, Phoenix, ArizonaCowboys vs. SteelersXXIX1995Jan 29Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, Florida49ers vs. ChargersXXVIII1994Jan 30Georgia Dome, Atlanta, GeorgiaCowboys vs. BillsXXVII1993Jan 31Rose Bowl, Pasadena, CaliforniaCowboys vs. BillsXXVI1992Jan 26Hubert H.

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks are back on top of the football world with a 29-13 rout of the New England Patriots.Seattle never trailed and often dominated. After grabbing a 3-0 lead on their first drive, the Seahawks slowly but surely pulled away. The defense was completely dominant, especially up front, as Drake Maye struggled to find anything downfield -- and that was on the rare occasion he had time to even look downfield. Behind a superb effort from Kenneth Walker III, the Seattle offense did enough to create some separation. The Seahawks led 9-0 at halftime and 12-0 entering the fourth quarter. Finally, Sam Darnold hit AJ Barner for a touchdown, and a Uchenna Nwosu pick six put the game to bed.The defense finished with six sacks. Through three quarters, Seattle out-gained New England 271-78. Though Maye eventually made some plays, the Seahawks were in control all game long.It was a dominant effort from a dominant team. The Seahawks had a +246 point differential this regular season, the best by a Super Bowl champion since the 1999 Rams. Coach Mike Macdonald flexed his muscle as a defensive mastermind, and now, he's the third-youngest Super Bowl-winning coach ever, only behind Sean McVay and Mike Tomlin.\nHere's who and what stood out -- good and bad -- in Super Bowl 60. Winner: Kenneth Walker III, his agent, and his bank accountThe first running back to win Super Bowl MVP since Terrell Davis in 1998, Walker was tremendous, finishing with 161 yards from scrimmage.Walker can be a polarizing back, with his incredible tackle-breaking sometimes only superseded by his belief that he can break every tackle. This season, among 52 players with at least 100 carries, he was seventh in explosive rush rate ... and 46th in rushing success rate.But on Super Bowl Sunday, we saw just how valuable that explosiveness can be. He had five carries of 10+ yards.\nWalker is 27. He's rarely been an every-down player. But after Zach Charbonnet went down with a torn ACL in the divisional round, Walker stepped up:145 yards from scrimmage, three touchdowns in divisional round vs. 49ers111 yards from scrimmage, one touchdown in NFC Championship vs. Rams161 yards from scrimmage in Super Bowl vs. PatriotsWalker is an impending free agent. Both Walker and coach Mike Macdonald have said they want Walker back in Seattle, and with Charbonnet coming off a major injury, there's a natural fit. Regardless, Walker has boosted his profile significantly over the past month ahead of his first time being a free agent. Expect a competitive market -- and, in turn, a nice payday -- for the Super Bowl MVP.Loser: The Patriots' offensive line -- especially the youngstersIf there's one clear area in which New England looked like the 13-loss team it was in 2024, it was the offensive line. It was a completely remade group that was certainly improved but not quite championship-caliber yet.\nRookie left tackle Will Campbell, the No. 4 pick, got a rude introduction to playoff football. Rookie left guard Jared Wilson also had plenty of tough moments, as did veteran center Garrett Bradbury. The right side of the line -- veteran right tackle Morgan Moses and right guard Mike Onwenu -- was much better.Campbell has to improve. It's an absolute must given his draft slot. We'll see what upgrades New England makes elsewhere.Winner: Sam DarnoldWe won't try to spin this: Darnold did not play well. He missed some throws he should have made, he tried to make some throws he shouldn't have, and he got lucky when several dangerous throws fell harmlessly to the ground. The stats are not particularly inspiring: 19-for-38, 202 passing yards (5.3 yards per attempt), one touchdown.\nBut Darnold is a Super Bowl champion. He's the first starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl on the fifth (or later) team in his career. He did not commit a single turnover all postseason after having an NFL-high 20 in the regular season.Trying to picture \"Sam Darnold: Super Bowl champion\" was impossible when he was with the New York Jets or the Carolina Panthers or the 49ers. But we don't even have to go back that far: After a tremendous season with the Minnesota Vikings ended with a disastrous flameout, he was cast aside once again. Was his 2024 a mirage? Was his playoff disaster the real Darnold?No. The \"real\" Darnold is now a Super Bowl champion. What an incredible, unlikely path.\nLoser: Mike Vrabel and Josh McDanielsVrabel had several questionable decisions, including ...not going for two down 19-6not going on fourth-and-3 at the Patriots' own 39 down 9-0not going on fourth-and-1 at the Patriots' own 41 down 12-0But when a team's coach is the CEO type -- not one who calls the offense or defense -- his coordinators have to be excellent. Vrabel's offensive coordinator, McDaniels, got beaten. Too often, his overmatched offensive line was left out to dry. Maye's athleticism wasn't on display enough. With two weeks to prepare, Macdonald pulled several tricks out of his bag. It didn't feel like McDaniels did the same.Winner: Mike MacdonaldIn the battle of the \"MIke\" head coaches, Macdonald throttled Vrabel. Macdonald's defense was absolutely overwhelming. Yes, there was a massive talent differential, but there was a massive scheme differential between Macdonald's defense and Josh McDaniels' offense. Macdonald got creative with his blitzing schemes. Four different players had at least one sack. Seven different players had at least one quarterback hit.Macdonald didn't play in the NFL. He didn't even play college football. After a spell as a Georgia assistant during which he earned his master's degree, he nearly took a job in the financial world.\nThen he got a spot with the Baltimore Ravens in 2014. He rose all the way to defensive coordinator. And now he's not only a Super Bowl champion but one of the brightest and best coaches in the game. He's 38 years old. He'll have to replace his offensive coordinator with Klint Kubiak off to the Las Vegas Raiders, but he has the defense of his dreams. What a climb.Loser: Drake MayeWhenever -- or if ever -- Maye watches film from this game, he'll rue several missed opportunities. Yes, he was under siege all game, and we'll get to that in a bit. But Maye missed several throws he could have made and normally does make. He looked flustered, and just when he appeared to get some semblance of rhythm, he threw an awful interception that all but sealed the game.\nMaye finished 27-for-43 for 295 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions (including a pick six by Uchenna Nwosu). He got sacked six times and lost a fumble. His -0.40 expected points added per dropback was the second-worst mark of his season, only \"ahead\" of his divisional round win against the Houston Texans.\nMaye took 21 sacks in the postseason, most in the playoffs. He had eight turnovers -- four interceptions, four fumbles lost -- in the playoffs, too. There is no doubt that the future is extremely bright. There is no doubt that this was a magical season. But there's also no doubt he and his surroundings must improve. Winner: The Seahawks defenseIf you didn't know them then, you should now. The Seahawks defense isn't stacked with superstars or household names to the average fan, but maybe this game will change that.Devon Witherspoon -- PFF's top-rated cornerback and a second-team All Pro -- had a sack and three quarterback hits. He runs like a cornerback and tackles like a linebacker. He is everything you could want in a football player.Ernest Jones IV had a team-high 11 tackles. He was also a second-team All-Pro, and now he has two Super Bowl rings, too.Derick Hall and Byron Murphy II both had two sacks. Nwosu had an interception returned for a touchdown.Leonard Williams has had a career rebirth in Seattle, making Pro Bowls each of the last two seasons.After signing with Seattle, DeMarcus Lawrence showed love for his former team, the Dallas Cowboys, but added he knew he couldn't win a Super Bowl there. It turns out he found the place he could.Nick Emmanwori is awesome. He runs like a cornerback, he hits like a linebacker (have we heard that phrase before?), and as a rookie, he added tremendous versatility to Macdonald's unit.Loser: Fans of offense and aggressive play callingYes, the game ended with 42 points and three offensive touchdowns. But this was a slog for a long time. The Patriots were shut out in the first half. Teams without a point in the first half of a Super Bowl are now 0-15. Neither Maye nor Darnold was close to their \"A\" game.\nThere was conservative play calling from both sides -- not unexpected given both coaches are defensive-minded, and the game was dominated by the defense -- and poor execution. Some of it was defense-induced, but both offenses left something to be desired.Winner: The Patriots' secondary -- especially the youngstersFor the frustrations with the youngsters on the offensive line, the Patriots must be ecstatic with how their core players in the secondary look. Christian Gonzalez was tremendous this postseason and especially in the Super Bowl. Early numbers say Gonzalez was the primary defender on seven passes, and he allowed just three completions for 36 yards. He made a phenomenal deep pass breakup that was one of few first-half highlights for New England.\nRookie Craig Woodson was also terrific, especially in the run game. That's been a constant all season. The fourth-round pick had a team-high 10 tackles, including three for loss.\nLoser: Stefon DiggsDiggs waited 178 games (including playoffs) to make the Super Bowl, with several close misses along the way. When he finally got there, he got smothered: three catches for 37 yards. He also found himself on the wrong end of a fracas with Josh Jobe.\nIt was a remarkable comeback season from Diggs, but it was an unsatisfactory ending.Winner: John SchneiderSchneider has now built the Seahawks into Super Bowl champions twice, and he did it with a different coach and an entirely different roster.It wasn't always a straightforward path. After building his first Super Bowl champion, Schneider had some misses in the draft. Then he absolutely crushed it. The 2022 draft produced six significant contributors to this championship team, including Walker. The 2023 draft -- thanks to the Russell Wilson trade -- had Witherspoon and Smith-Njigba. The 2024 draft brought defensive lineman Byron Muphy II and AJ Barner, who scored the first touchdown of the game. The 2025 draft brought Grey Zabel and Nick Emmanwori.But don't forget about trades that brought in Rashid Shaheed, Leonard Williams and Ernest Jones IV. Don't forget he took a chance on Darnold. Don't forget he moved on from Geno Smith and DK Metcalf this offseason. You don't become a Super Bowl champion without risks -- big and small -- from a personnel perspective. Schneider pressed the right button over and over again.Winner: The happy couple!Yes, that was a real wedding during Bad Bunny's halftime show. And I loved Bad Bunny as a whole, though I wish we got more \"DtMF.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jason Myers didn't win Super Bowl MVP on Sunday night, but he was definitely one of Seattle's most valuable players during their dominant 29-13 win over the Patriots. The Seahawks kicker set a Super Bowl record for most field goals by drilling five kicks. In the history of the Super Bowl, there had been four kickers who had hit four field goals, but no one had ever hit five. The record-setting kick came with just under five minutes left to play when he drilled a 26-yard field goal to put Seattle up, 22-7. \nThat kick followed four earlier conversions which came from 33, 39, 41 and 41. Not only did Myers set the Super Bowl record for most field goals, but he also etched his name into the NFL record book. With 17 points against the Patriots, Myers now has 206 for the season, which is the most that any player has ever scored in any NFL season ever. As a matter of fact, he's the only player ever to top 200 points in a single season. The regular-season record for most points is held by Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, who scored 186 points during his MVP season in 2006. Tomlinson tacked on two touchdowns during the postseason that year to give him a total of 198, and until Myers came along, that was the record most points ever scored by a player in the regular season and postseason combined in a single year. \nMyers was able to top Tomlinson's record because the Seahawks used him often during the regular season. He hit a total of 41 field goals while scoring 171 points in 2025, which led the league. To catch Tomlinson's all-time scoring total, though, Myers need to have a huge postseason and that's exactly what has happened. He scored 11 points, including two field goals, in Seattle's 41-6 win over the 49ers during the divisional round. He then followed that up with seven points in the Seahawks' 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC title game. Going into the Super Bowl, Myers was at 189 points, so breaking Tomlinson's record wasn't a given. Myers didn't even have to wait long to tie the record, because he hit three field goals in the first half against the Patriots, which tied the Super Bowl record for most field goals in the first half of a game. In the third quarter, Myers hit a 41-yarder that tied the Super Bowl record for most field goals and made him the first player in NFL history to hit 200 points. \nYou could certainly argue that Myers should have been Super Bowl MVP, but in the end, the award went to Kennth Walker. Myers would have been the first kicker ever to win the award, but he doesn't have much to complain about after a record-setting night where he was one of the best players on the field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        You're probably aware that Super Bowl LX is today, but do you know what time the big game will begin and end? With the 2025 NFL season finale on deck, knowing when and when to watch is of the utmost importance.The AFC champion New England Patriots and NFC champion Seattle Seahawks have kicked off in the big game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The Patriots arrived at this point by navigating the AFC playoff bracket the black-and-blue way with hard-nosed defense. New England has averaged 18 points per game this postseason, the fewest entering a Super Bowl appearance since the 1979 Los Angeles Rams. However, the Patriots' defense has allowed just 8.7 points per game — the fewest through three games since the 2000 Baltimore Ravens.The Seahawks landed in the Super Bowl after smoking teams left and right all season. Their +230 point differential is the fourth-best entering a Super Bowl in the 21st century and the best since the 2015 Carolina Panthers (+233).While millions of football fans are counting down to kickoff, some may not be sure exactly when the Super Bowl will start and end. Not to worry -- we have you covered with everything you need to know about the Super Bowl schedule from kickoff to the final whistle.\nFor live updates, highlights and analysis throughout the game, follow our Super Bowl LX live blog.What time does Super Bowl LX pregame coverage start?The pregame coverage for Super Bowl LX will begin at 1 p.m. ET on NBC. According to NBC Sports, the official Super Bowl LX pregame show will provide five and a half hours of coverage, analysis and predictions. Maria Taylor will host and be joined by co-hosts Noah Eagle and Jac Collinsworth.What time is the Super Bowl LX kickoff?Kickoff between the Patriots and Seahawks is set for approximately 6:30 p.m. ET. The game will be shown on NBC and Peacock.\nWhat time does the Super Bowl LX halftime show start?The Super Bowl halftime show is projected to begin sometime between 7:30 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. ET, according to CBS Sports. This is purely an approximate time range based on the average Super Bowl game running from around three to hour hours, so you'll have to stay locked in on the game's broadcast to know for sure. Bad Bunny will headline this year's show. We're providing real-time coverage of Super Bowl LX commercials, Bad Bunny's halftime performance, celebrity cameos and more in our Super Bowl entertainment live blog.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 60 Halftime Show set list predictions: Bad Bunny will perform DtMF, bring up Cardi B and J Balvin\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHow long does the Super Bowl usually last?The duration of Super Bowl LX will depend on the on-field action. The average length of Super Bowls played from 2005-24 is around 3 hours and 37 minutes, according to USA Today. If that average holds, the big game could wrap up around 10:07 p.m. ET.\nThat may be the average, but if this game comes down to the final drive -- like the first Super Bowl matchup between these teams to conclude the 2014 NFL season -- it could run longer. However, the teams' Super Bowl XLIX meeting lasted almost exactly the average length, with a game time of 3 hours and 36 minutes.\n            ",

Some come for the game-day snacks and stay for the Super Bowl halftime show, which is historically the most-watched musical performance of the year.The halftime show has been headlined by some of the biggest artists of all time and has delivered wild, iconic moments throughout the 60-year history of the Super Bowl.This year, Bad Bunny headlined, taking the stage at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Lady Gaga joined him on stage to perform her hit, \"Die With A Smile,\" marking her third Super Bowl appearance and first as a halftime show guest. Ricky Martin also joined the party, singing \"LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii\" (What Happened to Hawaii).The six-time Grammy winner and most-streamed artist in the world was announced as the headliner earlier this season.\nWe're providing real-time coverage of Super Bowl LX commercials, Bad Bunny's halftime performance, celebrity cameos and more in our Super Bowl entertainment live blog.Last year, Kendrick Lamar took the stage during the big game in New Orleans. In 2024, Usher headlined in Las Vegas. In 2023, Rihanna performed at State Farm Stadium during Super Bowl LVII. Before that, five performers took the stage for Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles: Eminem, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige performed during the Rams' win over the Bengals.For artists who play the Super Bowl halftime show, the audience is exponentially bigger than any they have ever encountered. It was not always like that, however.\nSo what were the shows like before they became must-see television? Do you remember that killer halftime show featuring the Rockettes, Chubby Checker and 88 grand pianos in 1988? Do you remember the captivating \"Be Bop Bamboozled\" at the Orange Bowl in 1989?

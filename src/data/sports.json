Jackson, who missed last week's 44-10 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a> with a hamstring injury, did not practice all week.

He will again be tasked with leading a struggling offense that has scored just 30 combined points over its last two games.</p><p>Jackson, a two-time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> MVP and four-time Pro Bowler, has thrown for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns and one interception in four games this season while completing 71.6% of his passes. His status beyond Sunday remains uncertain, particularly with Baltimore scheduled for a Week 7 bye. Jackson was injured during the Sept. 28 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>.</p><p>Baltimore is seeking to avoid becoming one of the few teams in NFL history to mount a playoff push after a 1-5 start; only four teams have done it.

It was a brief and uneven outing, as Rush completed 9 of 13 passes for 52 yards while the offense struggled to find rhythm. Despite that rough start, his experience will be critical as Baltimore faces another game without their star quarterback.</p>\n<p>Rush has appeared in 41 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/scoreboard/\">NFL games</a>, starting 15. Over his career, he has completed 61.2% of his passes for 3,694 yards with 20 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The most dominant pitcher over the last two seasons takes the mound in a winner-take-all Game 5 of the ALDS in the 2025 MLB postseason, which should bring the Tigers and their fans confidence. Tarik Skubal, the overwhelming favorite to win his second straight AL Cy Young, starts for Detroit against the Mariners, however, the Tigers are 0-3 in his three starts against Seattle this season, including dropping Game 2 of this series. The SportsLine model projects that trend to continue on Friday despite the Mariners being +100 underdogs, using the Mariners' money line as one of its Friday best bets at DraftKings.</p><p>With the latest <strong>DraftKings promo code</strong>, new users can get <strong>$200 in bonus bets </strong>if your first $5 bet wins. The model is also featuring a pair of college football games in its Friday best bets at DraftKings, backing Colorado State to cover as 6.5-point underdogs against Fresno State in a 9 p.m. ET kickoff on CBS Sports Network, and Rutgers. vs. Washington to finish Under 61.5 total points scored in its Friday parlay at DraftKings Sportsbook.

It enters the second week of the 2025 MLB playoffs a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. It is also a profitable 38-25 combined on money-line and over/under <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">college football picks</a> since the beginning of 2024. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">MLB betting</a> picks or <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">college football betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns.</p><h2>Friday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook</h2><ul><li>Mariners (+100) vs. Tigers</li><li>Colorado State (+6.5) vs. Fresno State (-110)</li><li>Rutgers vs. Washington Under 61.5 total points (-112)</li></ul><p>Combining the model's three picks into a Friday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +661 (risk $100 to win $661). <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet it at DraftKings here</a>:</p><h3>Mariners (+100) to defeat the Tigers</h3><p>Seattle scored four runs over five innings against Tarik Skubal in July and the Mariners scored three runs over 5 2/3 innings off him in April, resulting in a 5.91 ERA over two regular-season starts. Skubal had a 2.00 ERA against the rest of baseball, so although Skubal's greatness is undeniable, he hasn't been nearly as elite against the Mariners. Julio Rodriguez hit one of his 32 home runs off Skubal this season, and Jorge Polanco, who had 26 home runs this season, hit two homers off Skubal in Game 2. Cal Raleigh led baseball with 60 home runs this season, so Seattle has the offensive ability to take down Skubal on Friday, and the model projects the Mariners to win in 60% of simulations.</p><h3>Colorado State (+6.5) vs. Fresno State (-110)</h3><p>Fresno State is 5-1 this season, but the Bulldogs' last two wins have come by a combined five points. The Bulldogs failed to cover the spread in either of those victories, and they are 1-2 against the spread on the road this season. Fresno State defeated Colorado State, 28-22, at home last season, failing to cover this number when the Bulldogs were on their home field, but they'll travel to Colorado State for this matchup. The model projects Colorado State to cover the spread in 55% of simulations for a 9 p.m. ET start on CBS Sports Network.</p><h3>Rutgers vs. Washington Under 61.5 total points (-112)</h3><p>Each of these teams had huge offensive outbursts over their first three games, but none of those were in Big Ten play, and their totals have slowed down since the conference season began. After five of their first six combined games went Over this total, three of their last four combined games have gone Under it, with Washington going Under this number in each Big Ten contest. Washington went Under its over/under given by the sportsbooks in each Big Ten contest as well. Rutgers defeated Washington, 21-18, last year in a lower-scoring game, and the model projects the Under to hit in 63% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more college football and MLB picks for Friday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Friday best bets.

Players were selected without regard to position and received five points for each First Team vote and three points for each Second Team vote from a panel of 72 media voters. </p><p>The league did not release the full voting results, so it's unclear which players did not make the cut. On a team level, the Aces (two) and Indiana Fever (two) were the only franchises with multiple players represented. The expansion Golden State Valkyies were the only playoff team not represented. </p><p>Here are this season's honorees:</p><h2>2025 All-WNBA First Team</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Team</th><th>First Team votes</th><th>Second Team votes</th><th>Total points</th></tr><tr><td><p>Napheesa Collier</p></td><td><p>Lynx</p></td><td><p>72</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>360</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A'ja Wilson</p></td><td><p>Aces</p></td><td><p>72</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>360</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130768/alyssa-thomas/\">Alyssa Thomas</a></p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Mercury</a></p></td><td><p>71</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>358</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677881/allisha-gray/\">Allisha Gray</a></p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/ATL/atlanta-dream/\">Dream</a></p></td><td><p>67</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>341</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677896/kelsey-mitchell/\">Kelsey Mitchell</a></p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/IND/indiana-fever/\">Fever</a></p></td><td><p>58</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>320</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, the five finalists for MVP made up the First Team, and there was a major gap between these five and every other player. No one else even received 200 total voting points. As such, the most notable aspect of these results is the voting breakdown. </p>\n<p>One voter had Thomas on Second Team, which is a major surprise considering the season she put together for the Mercury -- she nearly averaged a triple-double and led the league in assists -- and the fact that she wasn't below fourth on anyone's MVP ballot. That means someone voted her at least fourth for MVP, and then put her on the Second Team, which doesn't make any logical sense in a world where All-WNBA teams are position-less. </p><p>It's also quite stunning that Gray (three) and Mitchell (four) were left off some ballots entirely after what they did for their respective teams. Gray was seventh in the league in scoring, sixth in 3-pointers and led the Dream to a franchise-record 30 wins and the No. 3 seed. Mitchell was third in scoring and put the Fever on her back to lead them to the playoffs despite a rash of injuries. </p><h2>2025 All-WNBA Second Team</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Team</th><th>First Team votes</th><th>Second Team votes</th><th>Total points</th></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1980587/nneka-ogwumike/\">Nneka Ogwumike</a></p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/SEA/seattle-storm/\">Storm</a></p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>60</p></td><td><p>185</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678025/jackie-young/\">Jackie Young</a></p></td><td><p>Aces</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>41</p></td><td><p>148</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678007/sabrina-ionescu/\">Sabrina Ionescu</a></p></td><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/NYL/new-york-liberty/\">Liberty</a></p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>40</p></td><td><p>125</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29101293/aliyah-boston/\">Aliyah Boston</a></p></td><td><p>Fever</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>34</p></td><td><p>112</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Paige Bueckers</p></td><td><p>Wings</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>34</p></td><td><p>112</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's no surprise to see Ogwumike, Young, Ionescu and Boston on the Second Team. Ogwumike and Young, in particular, seemed like locks to make the cut after their impressive campaigns. Ionescu was expected to make it as well as the only member of the Liberty's Big Three not to miss significant time this season, and Boston's sixth-place MVP finish suggested she would be be honored. </p>\n<p>The big question heading into Friday was whether Bueckers would make it. Bueckers had an incredible individual season. She finished fifth in scoring and ninth in assists, and tied the rookie single-game scoring record with 44 points. However, her Wings finished in last place at 10-34. While their poor record wasn't Bueckers' fault, it's rare for players from last-place squads to make an All-WNBA team. In the end, enough voters determined that Bueckers' impressive campaign was too hard to overlook. </p>\n            </div>",

The review concerns the actions of Giants coach Brian Daboll, who looked into the medical tent and was later shown yelling at the team doctor following an injury to Dart in the third quarter.</p><p>After taking a hit while running the ball, Dart was slow to get up before walking off the field and to the Giants' sideline, where he entered the blue medical tent in order to be evaluated for a concussion. Visibly anxious to the point of losing his composure, Daboll was seen walking over to the medical tent in order to check on Dart, and he was also spotted yelling at Giants head physician Dr. Scott A. Rodeo during the sequence.</p>\n<p>Daboll and the Giants could be subject to league discipline depending on what the league's investigation yields, <a href=\"https://x.com/JFowlerESPN/status/1976669065562501588\" target=\"_blank\">according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler</a>. Non-medical personnel are not allowed inside the medical tent during player evaluations.</p>\n<h2>Daboll apologized after game, has yet to hear from NFL</h2><p>Daboll, for his part, apologized for his actions in his postgame press conference Thursday night.</p>\n<p>\"I apologized directly to our team physician. I just wanted his ass  out there if he was okay,\" Daboll said. \"But I wanted the process, like we were getting  ready to go for it on a potential fourth down, I would have burned a  timeout if he could have come out there. I was asking how long was it  going to take. Again, you want your guy out there. Not at risk of anything else.  But he came out. I think he's going to be good. Is he going to be good  or not? I'm going to call a timeout on fourth down and go for this son  of a b----.</p><p>\"I love our doctors. ... I apologized. I was in the wrong.\"</p><p>Daboll in his Friday media availability said he had not heard from the league in regards to his actions on the sideline, but maintained that he respects the process of the NFL's concussion protocol and takes matters of player health and safety seriously.</p><p>\"Like I said last night, I went in, didn't actually go in, just stuck my head in to see how our quarterback was doing. In no way would I want a player to come back out there that wasn't ready  to play,\" Daboll said. \"I think I have great respect for that process. I know [Giants co-owner John Mara] is on the competition committee relative to health and safety.  That's very important to him. We've spoken about that. I was wondering  if it took 10 minutes, if it takes an hour, if it takes two minutes.  That's really where I was with asking the question that I asked when I  was on the sideline to make a decision on the game. </p>\n<p>\"Health and safety is  important to us, it's important to me, and that's what I'll say with  that.\"</p><h2>John Mara addresses controversy</h2><p>Following Daboll's comments on Friday, Giants co-owner, President & CEO John Mara said in a statement that he spoke to the coach Friday morning concerning his actions approaching the medical tent.</p><p>\"While I firmly believe, as he has stated, that he was not  trying to influence the process in any way, he understands that the  appearance of going to the tent is inappropriate,\" Mara said. \"We have protocols in  place as a league to ensure player safety, and we need to allow our  medical staff to execute those protocols without interference. We  understand the situation is under review by the NFL and the NFLPA, and  obviously we will cooperate fully.\" </p>\n<p>Given his standing as Giants owner and a key member of the NFL's competition committee, the incident involving Daboll marks an unnecessary headache for Mara, particularly given the good feelings that Thursday night's win should have generated. Mara, who recently announced that he has been diagnosed with cancer, was in attendance for the Giants' win and <a href=\"https://x.com/Giants/status/1976514277663179175\" target=\"_blank\">received a game ball</a> in the locker room following the 34-17 victory.</p><h2>Dart returned to field, led Giants to win</h2><p>In addition to Daboll, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697012/cam-skattebo/\">Cam Skattebo</a>, the Giants' emerging star rookie running back, was also seen trying to check on Dart inside the blue medical tent. Dart would miss just two plays, but the drive would end as backup quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> missed a throw on third down to a torrent of boos from the crowd.</p><p>Dart's trip to the medical tent was the lone blemish in his night, as he turned in a strong performance to win his first NFC East divisional game and his first against the defending <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> champion Philadelphia Eagles, who have long served as the Giants' tormentors. </p>\n<p>Dart went 17 of 25 passing for 195 yards and a touchdown while also running the ball 13 times for 58 yards and another touchdown, giving him an undefeated record at home to start his young career.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Neither team in this matchup is where it wanted to be at this point in the season. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a> had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff expectations, and those have been all but dashed. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BC/boston-college-eagles/\">Boston College</a> was hoping for a step forward in Year 2 under coach Bill O'Brien. but the Eagles have regressed in many ways.</p><p>At least the Tigers are feeling good after a 38-10 blowout of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UNC/north-carolina-tar-heels/\">North Carolina</a> last weekend. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874636/cade-klubnik/\">Cade Klubnik</a> picked up some confidence with a 254-yard performance that included four passing touchdowns to zero interceptions. The downside was that the Tigers only mustered 2.9 yards per carry against the Tar Heels, so Klubnik's arm may have to carry the load the rest of the way on offense. After a shocking 1-3 start to the season, Dabo Swinney's team now has a prime opportunity to get back to .500 against a wounded Boston College team this weekend.</p><p>While Clemson gained some confidence last week, Boston College got completely demoralized in a 48-7 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PITT/pittsburgh-panthers/\">Pittsburgh</a>. The Eagls' defense got absolutely carved to the tune of 503 yards as Panthers quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29272350/mason-heintschel/\">Mason Heintschel</a> threw for 359 yards in his first career start. The Boston College offense, meanwhile, put up just 216 yards as quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29121297/dylan-lonergan/\">Dylan Lonergan</a> struggled badly. The Eagles are now 1-4 on the season, and even just reaching a bowl game looks like a long shot.</p><p>As these two desperate ACC teams go head to head, here is everything you need to know about the matchup.</p><h2>Where to watch Clemson vs. Boston College live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time</strong>: 7:30 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Alumni Stadium -- Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ACC Network | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<h2>Clemson vs. Boston College: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Weakness vs. weakness:</strong> One interesting thing to watch in this matchup is the Clemson rushing offense against the Boston College rushing defense. It's a bit of a movable object vs. stoppable force situation. The Tigers have averaged just 110.8 yards rushing per game, which ranks 13th in the ACC. On the other side, the Eagles' rush defense ranks 14th in the league at 133.6 yards per game allowed. One team has to win this battle, and the one that does will go a long way to taking home a victory.</p><p><strong>Lonergan has cooled off:</strong> Through his first three starts this season, Lonergan was on fire. He was averaging 330 yards per game with nine touchdowns to just one interception. In his last two starts, Lonergan is averaging 147.5 yards per game with no touchdowns and two interceptions. If the Eagles are going to get back in the win column for the first time since Week 1, Lonergan has to get back in his early season rhythm against a Clemson defense that hasn't performed up to expectations.</p><p><strong>Clemson looking to make it 13 straight:</strong> The last time Boston College beat Clemson was 2010. Barack Obama was in his first term as president, and \"Toy Story 3\" led the worldwide box office. Since then, the Tigers have rattled off 12 straight wins in this series, and they're going for a baker's dozen on Saturday. Boston College has come close to ending the streak with three one-score losses mixed in there, but it has been the same story for a long time. Finally breaking through against Clemson would be a good way for the Eagles to get their season back on the rails.</p>\n<h2>Clemson vs. Boston College prediction, pick</h2><p>This is a tough game to pick because it's hard to trust either side. On the one hand, Clemson looked much better last week, but that win came against a North Carolina program that has already had to issue a vote of confidence for Bill Belichick. The Eagles got absolutely torched by a freshman quarterback making his own start. Ultimately, I'm not sure Clemson was as good as it looked in Week 6, and Boston College wasn't as bad as it looked. The Eagles are able to bounce back and keep this one within two touchdowns. <strong><em>Pick: Boston College +14.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>",

Reyburn as he exited the field. The confrontation was heated enough that Iglesias had to be held back.</p>\n<p>The confrontation likely stems from a called strike against Bogaerts in the ninth inning of the Game 3 loss. With the Padres down 3-1, Bogaerts took a down and away fastball in a 3-2 count that was called strike three. Rather than reach base with zero outs and bring the tying run to the plate, Bogaerts struck out. Here's the pitch:</p>\n<p>The pitch was inside <a href=\"https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search?hfPT=&hfAB=&hfGT=F%7C&hfPR=&hfZ=&hfStadium=&hfBBL=&hfNewZones=&hfPull=&hfC=32%7C&hfSea=2025%7C&hfSit=&player_type=pitcher&hfOuts=&hfOpponent=&pitcher_throws=&batter_stands=&hfSA=&game_date_gt=&game_date_lt=&hfMo=&hfTeam=&home_road=&hfRO=&position=&hfInfield=&hfOutfield=&hfInn=&hfBBT=&batters_lookup%5B%5D=593428&hfFlag=&pitchers_lookup%5B%5D=641745&metric_1=&group_by=name&min_pitches=0&min_results=0&min_pas=0&sort_col=pitches&player_event_sort=api_p_release_speed&sort_order=desc#results_pitchChart_name_641745_\" target=\"_blank\">Statcast's generic strike zone</a>, which is not adjusted for player height.

Unless the one-game suspension is overturned on appeal, he will have to serve it next season with whatever team he signs this winter. After hitting .229/.298/.294 this year and not signing with San Diego until after spring training opened, it's not certain Iglesias will find a new team this winter.</p>\n<p>The Padres went 90-72 this season and were the NL's second wild card team.

Yankee Stadium, the  fans, the organization, the culture that these guys have created in  this locker room. It really is special.\"</p><p>Bellinger, 30, had a terrific season in New York, hitting .272/.334/.480 with 29 homers and 3 stolen bases while seamlessly bouncing around the outfield. He played at least 40 games in all three outfield spots and played some first base as well. The 29 home runs are his most since his NL MVP season in 2019, and his 5.0 WAR was his best since 2019 as well.</p>\n<p>The Yankees acquired Bellinger in a salary dump trade with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> as part of their Plan B pivot after losing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152852/cody-poteet/\">Cody Poteet</a>, the right-hander the Yankees sent the Cubs in the trade, was designated for assignment in spring training. For all intents and purposes, the Yankees picked up a 5.0 WAR outfielder for free in the offseason.</p>\n<p>Because he received (and rejected) the qualifying offer two years ago, the Yankees can not make Bellinger the qualifying offer again, and will not receive draft pick compensation should he sign elsewhere. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a> will be a free agent as well and a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/whats-next-for-yankees-after-mlb-playoff-elimination-aaron-judges-team-faces-questions-as-drought-continues/\" target=\"_blank\">center fielder will be a top priority for New York this winter</a></span>.

The Razorbacks sprung a major upset in Fayetteville last year, and the Vols will be looking for revenge this weekend.</p><p>Tennessee is coming off a bye after surviving an overtime scare against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> in Week 5. To this point in the season, the Volunteers offense has been carrying the load, and they've scored at least 41 points in every game. Quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123610/joey-aguilar/\">Joey Aguilar</a> is second in the SEC in passing yards (1,459) and passing touchdowns (13). Meanwhile, receiver Chris Brazzell II leads the FBS in touchdown receptions with seven.

That unit is getting healthier on the defensive line, but the secondary is still shorthanded.</p><p>The Razorbacks are also coming off a bye week, and they have gone through many changes since the last time we saw them. Coach Sam Pittman was fired, and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/bobby-petrino-arkansas-football-interim-coach-seeks-redemption/\" target=\"_blank\">Bobby Petrino replaced him in an interim role</a></span>. Almost immediately, Petrino made some major changes by firing multiple people on the defensive staff, including coordinator Travis Williams. The Arkansas defense has been a mess so far, but the idea of Petrino having full control with Green at the helm of the offense is intriguing. Can those two come together and outscore Tennessee in Neyland Stadium?</p><p>Here is everything you need to know about what should be a fun offensive showcase in Knoxville.</p><h2>Where to watch Tennessee vs. Arkansas live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time</strong>: 4:15 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Neyland Stadium -- Knoxville, Tennessee<br /><strong>TV: </strong>SEC Network | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<h2>Tennessee vs. Arkansas: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Vols getting healthier in the trenches:</strong> To this point in the season, Tennessee has been unable to put its best foot forward in the trenches. On the defensive line, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28901098/jaxson-moi/\">Jaxson Moi</a> has missed significant time, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122113/daevin-hobbs/\">Daevin Hobbs</a> has yet to make his season debut. Moi returned against Mississippi State, and Hobbs wasn't listed on Wednesday's availability report, which signals his return to the lineup this weekend. On the other side of the ball, five-star freshman right tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29720433/david-sanders-jr/\">David Sanders Jr</a>. finally made his debut in Starkville after recovering from a shoulder injury, and he should see a larger role against the Hogs.</p><p><strong>Big changes in</strong> <strong>Fayetteville:</strong> After a 56-13 beatdown at the hands of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a>, Arkansas has made sweeping changes. Pittman is out, and Petrino is in as the interim, and he will push for the full-time job. As his first order of business, Petrino fired Williams and two other defensive assistants with the Razorbacks allowing a putrid 6.4 yards per play. Petrino and his remade defensive staff had two weeks to put together a game plan for Tennessee. Expect to see some new wrinkles as Arkansas tries to stun Tennessee for the second time in as many years.</p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29128902/colton-hood/\">Colton Hood</a> stepping up:</strong> Tennessee has been without its two starting cornerbacks -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122386/rickey-gibson-iii/\">Rickey Gibson III</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29168249/jermod-mccoy/\">Jermod McCoy</a> -- for essentially the entire season. Despite those losses, the Vols have managed to get by at that position thanks to the emergence of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/COLO/colorado-buffaloes/\">Colorado</a> transfer Colton Hood. In his first five games with the Vols, Hood has totaled an SEC-leading five passes defended and a pick six. Hood has played so well that he's even starting to work his way up 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> boards.</p><h2>Tennessee vs. Arkansas prediction, pick<br /></h2><p>The idea of Petrino getting into the lab with Green over the bye week does sound like a dangerous combination for Tennessee, at least at first glance. Then you realize that duo was there for the Razorbacks' upset of the Vols last season, and they put up 19 points at home. Granted, that was against a better Tennessee defense, but the Vols' offense was a far bigger problem than their defense in that one. That is no longer the case this year. Tennessee can pick its number against this Arkansas defense, and the defense does enough to cover a double-digit spread. <strong><em>Pick: Tennessee -12.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>",

The Irish defense struggled to get off the field against Miami, Texas A&M and for the first half against Purdue, leading to calls for coach Marcus Freeman to take on a bigger role. Since then, the defense has cut down on surrendering big plays, gotten increased pressure on the quarterback and snagged six turnovers in the past two games. NC State presents an opportunity for the Irish defense to prove that they have turned things around. The NC State offense ranks 31st in the nation with 447.7 yards per game and 26th in the nation in passing offense, representing a not insignificant test for Notre Dame's defense ahead of a showdown with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388474/cj-carr/\">CJ Carr</a> looks to continue to shine:</strong> Carr was in a tight preseason quarterback battle with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123034/kenny-minchey/\">Kenny Minchey</a> up until just before the season opener. Since winning the job, Carr has rewarded Freeman for his decision. Through five games, Carr has thrown for 1,280 yards with 11 touchdowns and two interceptions. Carr has been poised from the start of the season and looks like a man who will be playing on Sundays in the future. The Wolfpack defense has given up 243.2 yards per game through the air, giving Carr a chance to continue building on an already impressive rookie season.</p><p><strong>The Notre Dame running back room is on fire:</strong> Entering the season, only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> was considered to have a better one-two punch at running back. Through five games, it's not hard to argue that Notre Dame's backs have proven to be a more dangerous duo of the two. Preseason Heisman contender <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133405/jeremiyah-love/\">Jeremiyah Love</a> has rushed for 444 yards (5.4 yards per carry) and six touchdowns. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875230/jadarian-price/\">Jadarian Price</a> sits at 356 yards (7.4 per carry) and seven touchdowns. Add in three receiving touchdowns for Love and one for Price, and the pair have scored 17 touchdowns through five games. With Carr impressing under center, the pressure is off Love and Price to carry the full offensive load, making the entire offense more dangerous as a result.</p><p><strong>Don't overlook <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29389932/cj-bailey/\">CJ Bailey</a>:</strong> Wolfpack sophomore quarterback Bailey has been a big bright spot. He is currently fourth in the nation in passing yards with 1,660. He has also thrown for 13 touchdowns with just four interceptions. Against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CAMP/campbell-fighting-camels/\">Campbell</a> last week, Bailey passed for 337 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions. As previously mentioned, Notre Dame's defense struggled against the pass in the early weeks and Bailey has all the skills necessary to punish the Irish if the defense isn't locked in.</p>\n<h2>Notre Dame vs. NC State prediction, pick<br /></h2><p>Notre Dame is a -23.5 favorite heading into Saturday and there's little doubt they should win -- though this season has seen enough upsets to not take any win as a given. There's a good chance this is a high-scoring game, given the offensive weapons on both sides. NC State's defense isn't its strength and a Notre Dame team with Carr, Love, Price and a receiving corps with various threats should be able to put up points. The question is whether or not Bailey and the NC State offense can put up enough points to stay in the game. If Notre Dame's defensive improvements over the past few games are reality and not a mirage, it should be a long day for NC State. <strong><em>Pick: Notre Dame -23.5</em></strong></p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>No. 15 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> will travel to the West Coast on Saturday for a key Big Ten showdown against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a>. This will mark the second consecutive season these two teams have met in conference play, and it will be a rematch of a thrilling 27-24 win by the Wolverines over the Trojans last year. </p><p>The Wolverines are coming off a 24-10 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> last weekend to improve to 4-1. Michigan started slow and allowed the Badgers to jump out to a 7-0 lead after their opening drive, but pulled away in the second half behind another big game from running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123679/justice-haynes/\">Justice Haynes</a>. Michigan's lone loss came against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a> last month on the road. </p><p>USC is in the midst of a critical stretch that will decide its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff hopes. The Trojans are coming off their first loss -- a 34-32 setback on the road against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> -- and were idle last week. After this game against the Wolverines, the Trojans have a date with No. 16 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> on the road and another game away from Southern California against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a> on Nov. 1. </p><h2> Michigan vs. USC: Need to know </h2><p><strong>Haynes is off to a historic start at his new school:</strong> The former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> running back has elevated Michigan's run game into one of the top-ranked units in the country. Haynes has rushed for over 100 yards in each of his first five games, joining Denard Robinson as the only Michigan players since 2010 to accomplish the feat. After splitting the carries during his last two seasons at Alabama and rushing for 616 yards total, Haynes racked up 654 rushing yards and eight touchdowns during the first five games of 2025. </p><p><strong>USC's receivers will be the difference:</strong> USC star wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123772/makai-lemon/\">Makai Lemon</a> is coming off a breakout performance against Illinois. He caught 11 passes for 151 yards and two touchdowns. The week before against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a>, he finished with eight receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown. While Lemon has far and away been USC's best receiver this season, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29158151/jakobi-lane/\">Ja'Kobi Lane</a> has also shown he's capable of an expanded role any given Saturday. He has 13 catches for 278 yards and a touchdown thus far. The key to victory for USC will be getting Lemon and Lane involved early and often. </p>\n<p><strong>This game is a resume builder for USC and Michigan:</strong> With both teams sitting at 4-1 heading into this game, the winner will have an inside track to make a strong push toward a CFP berth. The Trojans have three ranked opponents remaining on the schedule (Michigan, Notre Dame and USC), while the Wolverines have just one (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a>). A win by USC likely vaults Lincoln Riley's squad back into the AP Top 25 poll, while a loss will make it an uphill climb to get into the CFP. As for Michigan, this would be a huge win after a setback last month against Oklahoma on the road. </p><h2> Where to watch Michigan vs. USC live </h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time</strong>: 7:30 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location</strong>: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum -- Los Angeles, California<br /> <strong>TV: </strong>NBC | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free) </p><h2> Michigan vs. USC prediction, picks<br />  </h2>\n<p>This game is a toss-up. I really like what Michigan has done with its running game and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906638/bryce-underwood/\">Bryce Underwood</a> is one of the best young quarterbacks in college football. USC has one of the best wide receiver duos in the sport, and that may ultimately make the difference in this one. This is a pivotal moment for Riley's tenure at USC because last year, against Michigan, his team fell short. A win over the Wolverines would change the narrative and would be one of his most impressive wins since leaving Oklahoma. This game will come down to the wire, but USC will walk away with a huge win. <strong><em>Pick: USC -2.5</em></strong> </p>\n<div><table><thead><tr><th><br /></th><th><div>\n

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a> has been solid in recent history but is still trying to beat the blue bloods in the mighty SEC. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a> comes to town as a slight favorite in the biggest showdown in the conference in Week 7.</p><p>Mizzou is an incredible 25-5 in its last 30 games, but most of those losses have come against the best of the best in the SEC (Alabama, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a>, LSU), which has kept the Tigers from reaching that next level of contenders. The Tigers won 10 games last season but were still blanked 34-0 by the Tide, showing just how far they were from being among the SEC's elite.</p><div><p>The No. 14 Tigers (5-0, 1-0 SEC) have started hot, again, but against a relatively easy schedule. The first five games ranked 80th nationally in strength, but the final seven games include four ranked opponents, making it the 12th-hardest remaining schedule in the land. </p><p>Meanwhile, No. 8 Alabama (4-1, 2-0) is seeking a 3-0 start in the SEC with all wins coming against AP Top 25 teams, which would be a first for the tradition-rich university. The Tide has rebounded nicely from their season-opening loss at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a>. Mizzou is seeking a third straight home win against a top 25 team for the first time since 1973.</p></div><h2>Alabama vs. Missouri: Need to know</h2><p><strong>Big Game DeBoer:</strong> Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer is incredible in ranked-on-ranked matchups. He's 13-2 in those games, the best winning percentage (.867) for any head coach in AP poll history. He's also 17-3 overall against top 25 teams, the second-most wins by an active head coach since 2021, ranking second behind Georgia's Kirby Smart (22), who he defeated earlier this season in Athens.</p><p><strong>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29336062/ahmad-hardy/\">Ahmad Hardy</a> Problem:</strong> Mizzou's Ahmad Hardy has emerged as the nation's leading running back, running for 730 yards and nine touchdowns through five games. He's run for 100-plus yards in seven straight games, the longest active streak in the FBS dating back to his playing days at ULM. Remember, Alabama's identity has changed quite a bit from the Nick Saban era. The Tide have been out-rushed in half their games under DeBoer, compared to only 19.6% of their games in the Saban era. Alabama is 4-5 under DeBoer in those games and Saban was 31-15. Somehow, Alabama has won both of its games against top 25 teams this season despite allowing 7 yards per rush.</p>\n<p><strong>Streaks made to be broken:</strong> Missouri has won 15 straight games at home, the second-longest active streak in the FBS. Alabama has defeated Mizzou six straight times. The Tigers last defeated the Tide in 1975.</p><h2>Where to watch Alabama vs. Missouri live</h2><p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time</strong>: 12 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location</strong>: Faurot Field -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLMB/columbia-lions/\">Columbia</a>, Missouri<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Start watching, save $20!)</p><h2>Alabama vs. Missouri prediction, picks</h2>\n<p>Alabama has struggled to score more than four touchdowns in its games against mid- to upper-tier power programs, which is fine, particularly with the defense playing so much better of late. Missouri loves to run the ball, ranking third nationally, and leads the nation in time of possession. The Tigers scored 29 in their only SEC game this season. The Tide ranks No. 1 in turnover margin, which could make for a lower-scoring game for the explosive Tigers. Picking a winner is difficult, especially with a 3.5-point spread in favor of Alabama, so we'll go with the point total (51.5) and side with the teams sliding just under.  <strong><em>Pick:

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> stopped its bleeding in impressive fashion last week, snapping a three-game losing streak with a 29-21 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a>. Its next opponent also hails from the Lone Star State, and the hostile confines of Kyle Field could make life more challenging on Billy Napier and his Gators than it was during the much-needed win at home. If this new momentum is to last more than one week, the Gators have to get past No. 5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a> on the road.</p><p>That is no easy feat. The Aggies are 4-0 at home including two consecutive SEC victories. Mike Elko has Texas A&M playing terrific offense, and the defense finally held up its end of the bargain in those two conference wins by allowing a combined 19 points to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a>.</p><p>Napier has not been one to string together big wins throughout his much-maligned Florida tenure. His struggles at taking Florida to the next level could help Texas A&M bolster what is quickly shaping up to be a potential College Football Playoff-caliber resume. As for his hot seat status, which is the primary topic surrounding the Gators program on a near weekly basis, another loss would almost certainly rekindle questions just one game after he bolstered his job security.</p><h2>  Florida vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  </h2><p><strong>Gators in a gauntlet:</strong> Schedules do not get much tougher than the one Florida faces this season. This game also marks the final week of a brutal stretch in which the Gators face four top-10 opponents in consecutive outings. They went 1-2 against No. 3 LSU, No. 4 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> and No. 9 Texas, so to add another victory against the Aggies to improve to .500 in that stretch would be respectable if not impressive, all things considered. Florida is not done with premier competition after this week, though. Two more top-10 foes (No. 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> and No. 4 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a>) loom in November.</p><p><strong>Boom or bust:</strong> The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29173876/marcel-reed/\">Marcel Reed</a> experience is a roller coaster. He is a rare case in that he ranks No. 7 nationally in yards per completion (14.6) but No. 98 in completion rate (59.7%). Reed brings a dynamic element to the Texas A&M offense and has the eighth-best odds, per <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel</a>, to win the Heisman Trophy. But throughout his starting tenure which dates back to last season, when things go poorly, they have a tendency to spiral. Fortunately for Reed, Florida's pass rush is far from the most formidable, so he could have ample time to operate and avoid costly errors.</p>\n<p><strong>Florida offense shows signs of life: </strong>Scoring 29 points on the elite Texas defense is impressive regardless of the context. What made it particularly surprising in Florida's case was that the Gators had yet to score more than 16 points against an FBS opponent heading into that win. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> looked healthier and more comfortable leading the offense with his most productive passing effort of the year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904625/jadan-baugh/\">Jadan Baugh</a> ran for more yards (107) on the Longhorns than on any other opponent this season and freshman receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29034062/dallas-wilson/\">Dallas Wilson</a> made a splashy college football debut with six catches for 111 yards and two touchdowns.</p><h2>  Where to watch Florida vs. Texas A&M live  </h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time:</strong> 7 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location: </strong>Kyle Field -- College Station, Texas<br /><strong>TV: </strong>ESPN | <strong>Live stream:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>  Florida vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  </h2>\n<p>Banking on Lagway to perform in a tough environment is asking a lot. He threw five interceptions at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a> and managed just 61 yards at Miami. Elko, defensive coordinator Jay Bateman and the 12th Man are more than capable of making life difficult on him in a similar fashion even with Wilson breaking out as a potential game-changer in the Gators' receiving corps. On the flip side, Florida boasts the best defense Texas A&M has seen all year. The threat of a defensive touchdown always looms, and 47.5 is not a very large number, but I have a hard time believing these offenses will put the ball in the end zone seven times. <strong><em>Pick:

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>CHICAGO -- Big Ten Media Days provides a golden opportunity to pepper the who's who about the pressing issues in college athletics. Private equity in college sports? NCAA Tournament expansion? The 5-in-5 eligibility snafu? Transfer portal rules? Revenue sharing? It was all discussed ad nauseam. </p><p>Lost in the sauce might be ... the hoops. </p><p>\"Can I hit you with an actual basketball question?\" I asked Thursday.</p><p>\"Yeah,\" Michigan State coach Tom Izzo says with a laugh. \"Hell of a theory!\"</p><p>Here's what we gleaned.</p><h2>Michigan State's SG competition is a three-man race</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29242262/jeremy-fears-jr/\">Jeremy Fears Jr</a>. is Michigan State's starting point guard, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29242256/coen-carr/\">Coen Carr</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28954115/jaxon-kohler/\">Jaxon Kohler</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28951781/carson-cooper/\">Carson Cooper</a> will form an intimidating, physical frontline trio. But it's a three-man race for the last starting spot between veteran <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/SAMFORD/samford-bulldogs/\">Samford</a> transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/26540523/trey-fort/\">Trey Fort</a>, returning sophomore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29559435/kur-teng/\">Kur Teng</a> and emerging freshman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29007979/jordan-scott/\">Jordan Scott</a>.</p><p>\"That's the one missing link right now,\" Izzo said. \"That two-guard is pretty important both offensively and defensively. It's going to be our biggest question mark.\"</p><p>Fort entered preseason as the favorite for the gig. He's a high-volume sniper from downtown who thrives in transition — long a staple of Izzo Ball — and he's already 24 years old. Defensively, though, is a major work in progress and was one of the reasons he fell out of the rotation the last time he was at a high-major program (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> in 2023-24). </p>\n<p>\"It's, uh, getting there,\" Izzo said. \"But his offense is there.\"</p><p>Teng and Scott might be young, but they're itching for a chance. Teng's shooting stroke is legit, and he's had a full offseason to master this system and get up to speed. He's going to play. Michigan State looks poised to try and get Scott on the floor even more now that prized <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/FAU/florida-atlantic-owls/\">FAU</a> transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29233971/kaleb-glenn/\">Kaleb Glenn</a> will miss the entire season with a devastating torn patellar. Scott, who ranked just outside the top-50 in the Class of 2025, is all of 6-foot-7 with oodles of shooting and playmaking in his bag. His time is coming, maybe sooner than Michigan State even initially anticipated.</p>\n<h2>Latest on the Muss Bus at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a></h2><p>Big Ten foes shot a horrifying 70% at the rim against USC last season. That rated in the third percentile nationally, per CBB Analytics, and it proved to be an incredible hurdle for a Trojan club that finished 5-17 against top-100 teams last season.</p><p>Eric Musselman went all-in on addressing that in free agency and early returns have been positive. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/26542840/chad-baker-mazara/\">Chad Baker-Mazara</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/ROBERT/robert-morris-colonials/\">Robert Morris</a> transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29557317/amarion-dickerson/\">Amarion Dickerson</a> have buffed up USC's wing defense. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28952234/ezra-ausar/\">Ezra Ausar</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29559984/jacob-cofie/\">Jacob Cofie</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29232753/gabe-dynes/\">Gabe Dynes</a> are three more transfers who should help USC's interior defense transform from a bad unit into a good one. </p>\n<p>\"Our lack of rim protection last year was, you know, I don't know what word to use,\" Musselman said. \"But we're a lot different, you know, blocking shots at the wing position. We're a lot different blocking shots at the power forward spot and then at the center spot, obviously, with Gabe Dynes' ability to alter shots. We have so much different length than we had last year.\"</p><p>Musselman has long coveted positional size, but don't be surprised if 5-foot-11 point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29231124/jordan-marsh/\">Jordan Marsh</a> gets plenty of burn. Before five-star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29667919/alijah-arenas/\">Alijah Arenas</a> suffered a knee injury (he will be re-evaluated in January), Musselman had visions of Arenas running the show at point guard and USC having the tallest starting lineup in college basketball with 6-foot-5 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28953053/rodney-rice/\">Rodney Rice</a> being the shortest player on the floor. Now, he's forced to pivot and Marsh, a UNC Asheville transfer, has shined.</p><p>\"Jordan might be the biggest surprise that we've had,\" Musselman said. \"We're going to need him to play a significant minutes. He changes the pace of the game for us. He can score at the point guard position. He's been a real, real pleasant surprise for us.\"</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/big-ten-basketball-preseason-media-poll-2025-26-purdue-michigan-state-overrated-indiana-underrated/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Big Ten basketball preseason media poll 2025-26: Purdue, Michigan State overrated; Indiana underrated</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cameron Salerno                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Big Ten basketball preseason media poll 2025-26: Purdue, Michigan State overrated; Indiana underrated\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/09/7b3f59af-fe55-4267-8b93-05efdf05a8fc/thumbnail/270x152/47ccf6ea1a58432dfd3cef4bf06670d2/untitled-design-37.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Injury opens the door for Washington's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/50014429/hannes-steinbach/\">Hannes Steinbach</a>  </h2><p>Washington forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/3177628/jacob-ognacevic/\">Jacob Ognacevic</a> will miss <a href=\"https://x.com/CBB_Central/status/1976332371063705672\" target=\"_blank\">\"about three months\" with a foot injury, per UW coach Danny Sprinkle</a>. Translation? More minutes are on the way for prized German freshman Hannes Steinbach, who has even earned some first-round buzz after a strong showing in this summer's FIBA U19 World Cup.</p><p>\"He is a very good player,\" Sprinkle said. \"There's times where you're still adjusting and being a freshman, too. We have to let him grow at his own pace. I don't want undue expectations on him. Like, he has expectations for himself, but I don't think everybody telling him he's a first-rounder getting drafted. Like, that's not fair, and I've told him that, I just need him to be Hannes because being Hannes is good enough, and it's going to help our team be the best we can be.\"</p><h2>Wisconsin's John Blackwell a bootyball threat</h2><p>Offensive guru Kirk Penney chose to leave the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> staff to spend more time with his family in New Zealand, but the Badgers have no plans on slowing down offensively after building back-to-back top-20 offenses for the first time in the Greg Gard era. Over 48% of Wisconsin's shots last year were 3-pointers, but star junior guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29233473/john-blackwell/\">John Blackwell</a> hinted that the number would be even higher in 2025-26. Wisconsin's front line of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29232969/nolan-winter/\">Nolan Winter</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29555379/austin-rapp/\">Austin Rapp</a> could combine for 10+ attempts from beyond the arc every night, and every guard in the Badgers' rotation (Blackwell, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/3178247/nick-boyd/\">Nick Boyd</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28952075/andrew-rohde/\">Andrew Rohde</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29231316/jack-janicki/\">Jack Janicki</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28953122/braeden-carrington/\">Braeden Carrington</a>) is a dangerous shooting threat.</p>\n<p>But you can't ignore the paint. With floor-stretching big men getting plenty of tick, don't be surprised to see the Badgers try to invert the floor with Blackwell as a bootyball threat. John Tonje was an elite post-up hub last year, and Blackwell plans to follow suit.</p><p>\"I love post-ups,\" Blackwell said. \"I don't care how tall you are. I love posting guards or bigs up. It's just a way I can add to my game, because obviously, you know, guys study my game now, and I'm at the top of the reports. You've got to add different layers to your game. I can confidently say I am one of the best back-to-the-basket guards in the country.\"</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28953005/donovan-dent/\">Donovan Dent</a> is promptly changing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>'s offense</h2><p>UCLA's offense was fine (37th nationally, fifth in Big Ten play) last year, despite rating in the first percentile nationally in shots at the rim, per CBB Analytics. That's going to change dramatically with star <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/NMEX/new-mexico-lobos/\">New Mexico</a> transfer Donovan Dent in the fold. </p>\n<p>\"That's one of the things I feel like this team has been a lot better at is getting the paint,\" UCLA senior guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28955474/skyy-clark/\">Skyy Clark</a> said. \"Even if it's not for a shot, just drawing the defense and kicking out for a 3. We've grown a lot in the area, and Donovan being there has been very beneficial.\"</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> freshman turning heads</h2><p>There aren't quite as many freshmen sensations in the Big Ten this year after Dylan Harper, Derik Queen, Ace Bailey, Kasparas Jakucionis, Jase Richardson and Will Riley all became first-round picks. This iteration of Big Ten basketball is grizzled and packed with stud veterans, and there are only a handful of true freshmen expected to be rotation players on the best rosters.</p><p>But keep an eye on Ohio State freshman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29107457/amare-bynum/\">A'mare Bynum</a>, who has a real path to a major role for the Buckeyes. Ohio State needs more defensive thump and physicality, and Bynum has both in spades. The 6-foot-8, 240-pound forward is competing with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/WRIGHT/wright-state-raiders/\">Wright State</a> transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/26540637/brandon-noel/\">Brandon Noel</a> for minutes at the 4.</p>\n<p>\"A'mare is a special young man, and he's going to be a special player,\" Ohio State coach Jake Diebler said. \"We're anticipating him being really impactful for us. He's got a couple things going for him. He's got elite maturity. He wants to be coached, and I think the other thing is, he's got the physical tools to be impactful.  I mean, he's got some real physicality to him as a freshman, and the consistency at which he operates and keeps coming back and asking for more work. It's been impressive. I think he's going to be ready to help us from Day One when we start games.\"</p><figure><p><img alt=\"Syndication: The Herald-Times\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/02/08/531c7b69-ff49-4d35-8abc-07368be151d0/resize/670x377/70896d370b76eeced4065dda42377362/usatsi-25370427.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>Michgian Head Coach Dusty May looks at the scoreboard during the Indiana versus Michigan mens basketball game at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall on Saturday, Feb. 8, 2025. </span><span>\n                                                                    Rich Janzaruk/Herald-Times\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Dusty May intrigued by three-big lineup</h2><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> coach Dusty May is a tinkerer, through and through. No lineup combination is off the table. Michigan loaded up in the transfer portal, landing three of the best available frontcourt pieces: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29231622/yaxel-lendeborg/\">Yaxel Lendeborg</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29558793/morez-johnson-jr/\">Morez Johnson Jr</a>. and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29233479/aday-mara/\">Aday Mara</a>. Don't be surprised if May tries to play all three of them together in his quest to dominate the paint on both ends of the floor. Lendeborg's versatility ties it all together, plus he's clearly going to shoot way more treys in this scheme. </p><p>\"I thought before we signed Yax that it would be a tall task and that we'd have to really fit some things together,\" May told CBS Sports. \"After coaching Yax this summer and fall, he's a guard. He's played some point guard duties. He's guarded point guards. He actually guards point guards better than he does 5 men, in my opinion. He's got a real unique skill set, and he loves to pass and he overpasses. Usually, that helps with chemistry.\"</p>\n<p>It's not a coincidence that both May and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a>'s Todd Golden -- two of the most analytically-tilting head coaches -- are experimenting with getting as much skilled size onto the floor as physically possible.

If the Basketball Gods gift us a Michigan-Florida tilt in March, May will have his own version of a three-big lineup ready to roll.</p><h2>'Fit matters' for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MINN/minnesota-golden-gophers/\">Minnesota</a>'s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28952948/cade-tyson/\">Cade Tyson</a></h2><p>Minnesota was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/big-ten-basketball-preseason-media-poll-2025-26-purdue-michigan-state-overrated-indiana-underrated/\" target=\"_blank\">picked 16th in the Big Ten's preseason media poll</a></span>, which is a different neck of the woods for new coach Niko Medved, who led <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/COLOST/colorado-state-rams/\">Colorado State</a> to the NCAAs in three of the past four seasons.</p><p>Medved needs to revive UNC transfer Cade Tyson if Minnesota wants to sniff a Big Dance appearance in Year 1.

He's that guy you look at, and you're like, 'What position is Cade?' I don't know, but he can make shots. score around the basket, he's got a lot more pop athletically than people think, and he's got a toughness and competitiveness about him.

Jacobsen is more of a pick-and-pop threat, while Cluff is that prototypical low-post, bulldozing scorer. Some of Kaufman-Renn's hot spots will be different depending on which center is on the floor. \"Our scheme may be a little bit different, but we're still going to try a lot of the same actions,\" Kaufman-Renn said. \"But they both have unique skill sets and do different things.\" The good thing for Purdue is that Matt Painter knows what he's doing, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28954688/braden-smith/\">Braden Smith</a> is the best point guard in America. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a> coach Fred Hoiberg gushed about Smith at every opportunity and dubbed him, 'the best pocket passer I've ever seen.\"</li><li>Speaking of the Huskers, Hoiberg has accumulated serious frontcourt depth.

This is an Illinois squad that looks to be one of the best in the league, but the lack of cohesion is a cause for concern. Petrovic got on campus right before the fall semester started and still has not been cleared by the NCAA. Stojakovic suffered a knee sprain. Ivisic missed Big Ten Media Days due to a tonsillectomy and will be sidelined for a few weeks.</p><p>\"I haven't seen 'em all together,\" Underwood said, <a href=\"https://247sports.com/college/illinois/article/tomislav-ivisic-tonsil-removal-illinois-fighting-illini-basketball-mihailo-petrovic-andrej-stojakovic-kylan-boswell-256175750/\" target=\"_blank\">via Illini Inquirer's Jeremy Werner.</a> \"I love this team. I like our size, I like our versatility. I think that my questions arise because I haven't seen Andrej Stojakovic with Mihailo and the two bigs together. There's a lot of things I haven't seen yet. I love what we have the ability to be, especially offensively. We're more talented offensively than we were a year ago. Defensively, we got to continue to grow. I think that's always the slowest and the hardest thing to develop. But I do like our size. I do like our ability to protect the rim. But we're trying to win a national championship every time we start a season, and that's our standard. No different this year.\"</p></li><li><p>New <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a> coach Ben McCollum has no plans of trying to get star point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29558004/bennett-stirtz/\">Bennett Stirtz</a> more rest and is trying to develop multiple secondary options (like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/29556237/isaia-howard/\">Isaia Howard</a>) who can play on the ball and give Stirtz more opportunities to work as an off-ball weapon. \"(Stirtz) is good on and off the ball, just depends on what we need that game,\" McCollum said. \"And he gives him a rest, if you will, to where he doesn't have to bring it up maybe one possession, because the 30 seconds that I give him a break for sometimes isn't enough.\" Stirtz, who played 39.4 minutes per game last year, will be the Big Ten's Iron Man in 2025-26.</p></li></ul>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Big Ten is responsible for two of the three top 25 showdowns on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> schedule this weekend, and the first of them comes when No. 1 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> hits the road for a clash with No. 17 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a>. The Buckeyes' perfect season is on the line in what is, from a rankings perspective, their toughest test since the opener. On the other sideline, the Fighting Illini could re-emerge as College Football Playoff contenders if they pull off the upset.</p><p>It will be a battle of strength versus strength when the high-octane Illinois offense squares off against Ohio State's formidable defense. Veteran quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26701853/luke-altmyer/\">Luke Altmyer</a> has Illinois cooking with his scalding hot start in which he completed 73.6% of his throws for 12 touchdowns without an interception across six games. It will take his best effort to move the ball with any semblance of consistency against the Buckeyes, though, given they have yet to allow an opponent to reach double digits on the scoreboard.</p><p>This is one of the biggest games remaining on both teams' schedules. Between the two, only one additional ranked matchup lies ahead before the end of the regular season. The time is now to earn a resume-building victory before the slate gets lighter.</p><h2>  Ohio State vs. Illinois: Need to know  </h2><p><strong>First Illibuck matchup since 2017: </strong>Ohio State and Illinois played nearly every year for most of this series' lengthy history, which dates back to 1902. Big Ten expansion over the last decade and a half altered the traditional rivalry, though, and the foes have not done battle since 2017 when the Buckeyes won a 52-14 rout to extend their winning streak over the Fighting Illini to nine games. The teams play for the Illibuck, a carved wooden turtle that serves as the second-oldest trophy in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p><strong>The Matt Patricia effect: </strong>Ohio State's first-year defensive coordinator is a superstar, and the countless players who stepped into starting roles for the first time in their careers this season have done nothing but rise to the occasion. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877692/caden-curry/\">Caden Curry</a> leads the Big Ten in tackles for loss and sacks, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28898674/caleb-downs/\">Caleb Downs</a> remains one of the sport's best overall players and numerous other standouts emerged on what is through six weeks the most impenetrable defense in college football. The Buckeyes have allowed two touchdowns all season; that is an unbelievable reality in Week 7.</p><p><strong>Altmyer and Beatty among national leaders: </strong>There are few one-two punches in the nation as unstoppable as Altmyer and wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915401/hank-beatty/\">Hank Beatty</a>. The former boasts the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the sport, and the latter is the only player in the country with a passing, rushing, receiving and punt return touchdown this season. Beatty has been everything Illinois needed after it lost its top two receivers from a year ago, and the passing game has thus not skipped a beat as one of college football's top attacks.</p><p><strong>Bo knows: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28906284/bo-jackson/\">Bo Jackson</a> -- the Ohio State freshman running back, not the two-sport legend -- is perhaps the most pleasant surprise in the Buckeye program. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28905306/james-peoples/\">James Peoples</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28900249/cj-donaldson/\">CJ Donaldson</a> projected to lead the backfield, but it has instead been Jackson who emerged as the top ballcarrier in this potent offense. His 360 yards gives him nearly as much production as Peoples and Donaldson combined despite handling only about one-third of the team's carries. Jackson's workload increased in the last two games, and he figures to again be a focal point of the scheme this week against Illinois.</p>\n<h2>  Where to watch Ohio State vs. Illinois live  </h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, Oct. 11 | <strong>Time:</strong> 12 p.m. ET<br /><strong>Location: </strong>Gies Memorial Stadium -- Champaign, Illinois<br /><strong>TV: </strong>Fox | <strong>Live stream:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><h2>  Ohio State vs. Illinois prediction, picks  </h2>\n<p>Unstoppable force, meet immovable object. This game is all about whether Illinois' offense can be the first team to find any kind of success against Ohio State. The Fighting Illini have only had one game go under this 51.5-point total, while the Buckeyes have only gone over that mark once. If you trust Patricia to keep his defense humming at its unfathomable level, the under is the play. If you trust Altmyer to find the end zone a time or two, over. One of those two wavered once this season (Illinois scored just 10 points against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a>) while the other is as steady as they come, so I lean toward the Buckeyes controlling this and keeping it on the lower-scoring side. <strong><em>Pick: Under 51.5</em></strong></p><div><table><thead><tr><th><br /></th><th><div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\"

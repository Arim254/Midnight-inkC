After an almost two-week dead period, the College Football Playoff is set to return Wednesday with the quarterfinal round of games. On paper, this is one of the most thrilling playoff slates we have seen yet. It got started with No. 10 Miami stunning No. 2 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. The Hurricanes jumped out to a 14-0 lead early then withstood a second-half rally from the reigning champs to take home a 24-14 win. The action on New Year's Eve sets the table for a busy New Year's Day. No. 4 Texas Tech and No. 5 Oregon kick things off at noon in the Orange Bowl, which represents the Red Raiders' playoff debut. No. 1 Indiana starts its journey at 4 p.m. ET in the Rose Bowl. The Hoosiers will have to get past a resurgent No. 9 Alabama, which won its first playoff game under Kalen DeBoer in dominant fashion when it went on the road and trounced No. 8 Oklahoma. Then, the Sugar Bowl plays host to an SEC rematch in the nightcap. No. 3 Georgia and No. 6 Ole Miss have become familiar foes in recent years; this will be the fourth time they've played each other since 2023 and the second time this season. Georgia rallied from a 35-26 fourth-quarter deficit on Oct. 18 to secure a 43-35 victory against the Rebels. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternQuarterfinalsThursday, Jan. 1Sugar Bowl (3) Georgia vs. (6) Ole Miss --:  8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9Peach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. First roundFriday, Dec. 19\n(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasOrange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Hurricanes got a huge game from their defensive line and an efficient performance from quarterback Carson Beck in the victory. Action continued Jan. 1 when No. 5 Oregon defeated Texas Tech, 23-0, in the Orange Bowl.

    "body": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Florida — The smell of sweat and cigar smoke permeated through the Oregon locker room and there was a feeling of satisfaction for a Ducks team that had just punched its first ticket to the College Football Playoff semifinals in more than a decade. Though the 23-0 shutout win against Texas Tech was far from perfect, it was a statement victory that answered some concerns and affirmed some of the programs core principles under Dan Lanning. Junior linebacker Matayo Uiagalelei was a little bit frustrated he hadn't been able to score on his strip sack of Behren Morton in the third quarter, one of four turnovers forced by Oregon's defense that led to 13 of the Ducks' points, but as he sat in his locker after the game he was happy to have set up the offense with an easy touchdown on the next play. Those forced turnovers are part of an aggressiveness that the defense, and the team in general, carry into every single game. \"We talk about it all the time, one of the deciding factors in the game is the turnover margin,\" Uiagalelei said, reflecting on the play. \"So getting the ball and keeping the ball when you have it is one of the keys to the game.\" The aggressiveness to attack the ball and make plays on defense is matched by an aggressiveness on offense that includes the strategic use of tempo but also some risk-taking when it comes to fourth downs. Dan Lanning has had fourth down decision-making as a storyline throughout his young coaching career, and in one of the biggest games since he took over the Ducks' program he chose to go for it on fourth down eight times. \nPrior to Thursday's showdown with Texas Tech, Oregon had gone for it on fourth down just 22 times in 13 games. Now that doesn't suggest that the Ducks were not aggressive before, because as one of the top offenses in the country there isn't always a decision to be made when it comes to fourth downs. But against the Red Raiders and their ferocious defensive front, Oregon failed to convert on third down as often as they usually do and therefore faced more tough decisions. The successful conversions didn't always lead to points, but they extended drives to keep the ball out of the hands of Texas Tech's offense while also adding snaps of wear and tear for the opposing defense. One of those successful conversions came on a fake punt near midfield, where a unique formation spread out Texas Tech's punt return unit and allowed linebacker Teitum Tuioti to get free as a pass catcher. Tuioti said after the game he thinks it was his reception in a game since high school, but clearly he was prepared for the moment to pull in the toss from James Ferguson-Reynolds. \n\"I think that's our mindset,\" Lanning said of the decisions to go for it on fourth down. \"We make those decisions early in the week, and I certainly trust our offense. And [we] just felt like ultimately, if you limit the opportunities for their offense to be on the field, you were going to increase the opportunities for us to go score and them not to, and that showed up today.\"For Lanning and Oregon, the commitment to aggressiveness allows his players to play free. If the messaging was mixed or if the decisions were not consistent, there would be a human nature to allow doubt to creep in when plays like the fake punt or key fourth decisions are called. Because while Oregon went for it on fourth down on eight different occasions the Ducks also failed to convert four times, including a fourth-and-goal from the 2-yard line. But instead of letting those failures deflate the team, the defense jumped right back on the field with the intention to attack and get the ball right back. \"I'm grateful that Coach Lanning is aggressive and that he takes his shots,\" Tuioti said after the game. \"But we understand that if it doesn't go that way we are ready to put out the fire. That's what we do, we've got to get the ball back to our offense and that's our main job.\" \nThat's how four turnovers lead to 13 points and Oregon was able to bury Texas Tech in its biggest deficit of the season before the end of the third quarter. This was an Oregon defense that had something to prove after allowing James Madison to score 34 points and amass 509 yards in the College Football Playoff's first round. The Ducks were never in danger of losing the game thanks to an outstanding offensive start, but the leaders of the defense knew that wasn't their standard. Linebacker Bryce Boettcher acknowledged in a conversation on CBS Sports HQ after the game that all the hype and buzz around Texas Tech's defense did create a little bit of an edge for the Ducks as they looked to not only right their wrongs from the opening round but prove that they were just as much of a group that could win the game as their opponents from Lubbock. So now Oregon advances to the College Football Playoff semifinals and the Peach Bowl, set to face either Indiana or Alabama. It's the first time the Ducks have been in the CFP semifinals since finishing as national runner-up in 2014-15 and now in this year's tournament have logged two wins against conference champions. Beating Texas Tech was arguably the biggest win for the program since last year's Big Ten Championship Game against Penn State (another win that warranted firing up postgame cigars), but there is so much more work to be done for this Oregon team to accomplish its ultimate goal of a national championship. \nThat game, by the way, would be back here in Hard Rock Stadium on Jan. 19. And the fact that Oregon pitched a shutout win on the same field where the Ducks could ultimately claim the school's first national championship was not lost on some. \"This place was amazing, and we want to be back,\" Tuioti said. \"So we have to make sure we handle business and win.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus is feeling the heat. His Dallas defense in Year 1 as the team's defensive coordinator under head coach Brian Schottenheimer is allowing 29.8 points per game, the most in the NFL. One of the elephants in the room regarding the Cowboys' defensive decline is the 2025 season was the first without All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, whom Dallas traded away to the Green Bay Packers a week before the season began. Eberflus noted his impact but also accurately assessed Parsons' departure \"is what it is.\" \"Obviously you have an All-Pro pass rusher that wins really quick [Parsons], that's certainly going to help any defense if it's Micah or if it's Myles [Garrett] or whoever that might be. But that impact player is always going to help to a certain degree in pass downs and other downs,\" Eberflus said Thursday. Again, you can't look back right? It is what it is and then you just focus where you are.\"\n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 4.0: Cowboys beef up the trenches as the Steelers look for help at WR\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nParsons himself saw that comment on Twitter/X, and he reposted Eberflus' press conference quote with a number of laughing emojis. He then clarified why he took an apparent shot at Eberflus and the Cowboys an hour after posting the initial reaction. \n\"Y'all want me to feel bad? Jerry Jones slandered my name  to Cowboys media and national media for months,\" Parsons posted on Thursday. \"So I do think I can react to comment if I want to! #respectfully.\"\nDallas' defense was also derailed by injuries across the board at cornerback with DaRon Bland (foot), ex-Cowboy Trevon Diggs (knee/concussion), Shavon Revel (knee) and Caelen Carson (knee, hamstring). Diggs and Eberflus also clashed about zone vs. man coverage usage all year long. \"I think the start of the year, guys were in and out, in terms of we weren't at full force,\" Eberflus said. \"And then when we got some guys back, I thought we had a good stretch there. I thought the stretch was pretty good. We started to improve. I know we improved in the run defense and the third-down defense. And then from there we just didn't execute the way we wanted to at certain moments. Certainly, some good execution in there at times, but it's got to be better.\"  \nDespite the Cowboys' defense ranking bottom-three in the NFL in almost every key defensive metric this season, Eberflus claimed he didn't think he would \"do anything differently\" when CBS Sports asked what things he would do differently if he could go back to the beginning of the year. \"I don't really think about it that way,\" Eberflus said Thursday. \"I think about being in the moment and just keep adjusting and learning and growing and getting better. I don't think I'd do anything differently. I think I would just work to adjust when you get different players in and those things. I think that's what you do as a coach.\"  Cowboys defense under Matt Eberflus in 2025, NFL ranksNFL rankPPG allowed29.8LastTotal YPG allowed376.830thYards per play allowed6.231stPassing yards per game allowed253.6LastThird down conversion rate allowed 46.5%30thRed zone TD rate allowed 68.9%31stCompletion percentage allowed68.6%30thPass yards per attempt allowed8.231stPasser Rating109.7LastHowever, Eberflus ultimately fell on the sword and took full accountability for the year-long struggles Dallas has had on defense. \"Ownership and accountability is right with me,\" Eberflus said when asked how much ownership he takes for the defensive struggles. \"I'm the defensive coordinator, so it's always that. … I take full accountability.\"  We wanted to see more progress during the course of the year,\" Eberflus said. \"It was just more up and down. It just wasn't linear.\"Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones may choose to have Eberflus' ownership of his defensive woes result in a firing after just one season. Jones admitted regret for hiring him in Week 16 after Dallas was officially eliminated from playoff contention.\"Ultimately, you point your finger right back at you on who hired Matt Eberflus,\" Jones said. \"It's easy to say you could have done things differently, but that goes with the territory. Any time you make the ultimate decision, then you've got to look at that and weigh it.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        What's one more rematch in the College Football Playoff? After seeing two in the first round of the tournament, we get a third as No. 1 Indiana and No. 4 Oregon will meet in the Peach Bowl semifinal on Friday, Jan. 9 in Atlanta. Indiana won the first meeting, going on the road to beat Oregon 30-20 at Autzen Stadium in one of the biggest games of the regular season. It was also a moment when the country took notice of Indiana and recognized that while last year's team was never able to break through against elite competition, this year's team might just be a little different.It's a big game for the Big Ten as well. This meeting marks the third time in the last four seasons that the Big Ten has had two schools in the semifinals, and it also means the Big Ten will have a team in the championship game for the third straight season, giving it a shot to win its third straight national title with a third different team.\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about IndianaIn a sport not known for having Cinderella stories, the Indiana Hoosiers are the closest thing you're going to get. A program with no positive football history to speak of, they burst onto the scene last year with a brash, mostly unknown coach named Curt Cignetti. Cignetti led Indiana to an 11-2 record last season that ended with a College Football Playoff loss to the same Notre Dame team that would lose to Ohio State in the national championship.\nMost discounted Indiana's ability to pull off an encore in 2025, but this year's Hoosiers team was even better. The addition of Cal transfer quarterback Fernando Mendoza helped take the offense to another level, which resulted in Indiana going 13-0 during the regular season and winning the Big Ten with a 13-10 win over Ohio State. It also resulted in a Heisman Trophy for Mendoza, the first in program history.Still, not even those accolades quieted all the doubters, but you won't hear from them as often after Indiana crushed Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl. Blowout victories have been nothing new for this Indiana team. Nine of the team's 14 wins this season have come by at least 20 points, with seven coming by 30 or more. That's what happens when you combine an explosive offense with a bone-crushing defense.\n\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about OregonThe Ducks did not enjoy their postseason last year. After running through their first Big Ten campaign with an undefeated record and winning the conference, they had their doors blown off in the Rose Bowl by an Ohio State team they beat in the regular season. There has been no such postseason letdown this year.Oregon took care of the upstart James Madison 51-34 in the first round of the College Football Playoff and followed that performance with a 23-0 shutout victory over Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl a week ago. Those were their first wins in the playoff since the inaugural edition in 2014 when they beat Florida State.However, if you haven't paid much attention to college football since then, these Ducks may not look like the ones you're thinking of. This is not a high-flying, up-tempo offense that's trying to run 100 plays and score 60 points every game. While it certainly has that offensive potential, Dan Lanning's Oregon squad is built along the lines of scrimmage and more closely resembles the Georgia teams where Lanning was a defensive coordinator.\nOn offense, the team is led by QB Dante Moore, who could be a first-round pick in the NFL Draft this spring. Still, while Moore is talented and has plenty of excellent receiving options at his disposal, Oregon has been reliant on its run game in the second half of the season -- and as the ground game goes, so go the Ducks. It found plenty of space to maneuver against James Madison, and the Ducks scored 51 points. It struggled against Tech, and Oregon struggled to score touchdowns.What didn't struggle is the defense. Oregon's unit may not be full of the household names and obvious first-round picks, but there aren't many defenses in the country that do a better job of taking away big plays and forcing you to put together long, arduous drives to put points on the board. Every yard you gain against this unit feels like five.Peach Bowl odds, predictionThey say it's hard to beat the same team twice during the regular season, yet we've seen it happen already in this College Football Playoff. Indiana beat Oregon 30-20 earlier this season in Oregon's own building. This meeting will be at a neutral site, and given the struggles of Oregon's offense against Texas Tech, I'm not overly confident they'll figure things out against another really good defense. I'm taking Indiana this time, too. Pick: Indiana -4.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's rare that a Premier League job opens to start the new year where a team is not only still alive in the Champions League but also firmly in the race for a top-four position, but business has been anything but normal at Chelsea over the past few seasons. After winning the Europa Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup last season, manager Enzo Maresca has departed the club by mutual consent, opening quite a role at Stamford Bridge. The Blues will now look for their seventh manager since 2020 (including interim managers), but the top target could already be in scope. Let's take a look at who the Blues may be taking a look at to replace Maresca:Liam Rosenior, StrasbourgAlready in the BlueCo ecosystem that has sent players to Chelsea, it's hard not to consider the French side when looking at the potential next steps for the Blues, which is also why he's the leading candidate for the job, according to The Athletic. While Andrey Santos is the only current member of the Chelsea squad to have spent time at the French club, there is a strong development aspect of sending Chelsea prospects abroad to spend time under Liam Rosenior. With the two clubs under BlueCo, the connection is already there. The English manager has had a lengthy playing career while also spending time managing Hull City after hanging up his boots, before taking over the French club in 2024. While Strasbourg are currently in the Europa Conference League, there are valid concerns about whether a jump into the pressure cooker that is Chelsea may be a step too far for him as a manager at this stage. His side are eighth in the Ligue 1 table but have struggled in recent matches, only winning four of their last 10 matches in all competitions before the winter break. Knowing the system would still come as a plus due to Rosenior having a quicker settling-in period, but if it meant looking over more experienced options, that could keep Chelsea out of Europe next season.Filipe Luis, FlamengoThriving in his first managerial job at Flamengo in Brazil, Filipe Luis has a rising managerial star. His side had a strong run at the Club World Cup, but he was also able to win the league and the Copa Libertadores in 2025. While Filipe Luis would have similar concerns of not having managed a top European club, his time at Atletico Madrid as a player and coaching players such as Jorginho currently will add to his ability to command a locker room at Chelsea. His expansive playing style is also something that could suit the Blues while keeping the possession-based approach that they developed under Maresca.\nCesc Fabregas, ComoPushing for Champions League soccer with Como, it feels like only a matter of time until Cesc Fabregas ends up at a massive job. Already linked to Inter when they hired Cristian Chivu, the former Chelsea midfielder would be one of the top names that they could get for the role -- if he were open to leaving the club midseason, that is. With where Chelsea are, they can't afford an interim manager or waiting for their guy, so Fabregas' loyalty to Como could come at the expense of a club like Chelsea, who need a manager right now. Fabregas' success with youth players like Nico Paz is something that could fit right in at Stamford Bridge, but the timing of a match here feels just slightly off.Frank Lampard, CoventryIs the third time the charm? You can't mention Chelsea managers without mentioning Lampard, who has had two spells in charge of the club since 2019. He is on track for a return to the Premier League with Coventry City, but if he could take over a club like Chelsea, that's still preferable to hoping that he could avoid relegation next season if the Sky Blues get to the Premier League. While it's unlikely that Chelsea would go after Lampard yet again, it's happened enough that it has to be in the realm of comprehension.\nOliver Glasner, Crystal PalaceRising up the managerial rankings by the day with Crystal Palace, Glasner is someone else who should be in consideration for Chelsea. He has already won a European title with Eintracht Frankfurt, and between his time there and at Wolfsburg, Glasner has shown that he can manage at top levels by also winning the FA Cup last season. A pragmatic manager who is comfortable changing his style depending on who is available and the opposition, Glasner would be among the top names that the Blues could net, but availability, looking to do this in January again, comes as an issue.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There is nothing in the sport of boxing that quite resonates to the masses like a thunderous knockout punch. Whether we are talking heavyweights or even the smallest of weight divisions, the criteria is typically a mix between the importance of the punch, the aesthetic (and violent) beauty of the finish and whether the knockout has that truly viral quality to it. Our panel of CBS Sports experts sat down, debated and cast our votes for knockout of the year in 2025. Let's take a look at the results: More Best of Boxing in 2025: Fighter of the Year | Fight of the YearWinner: Brian Norman Jr. def. Jin SasakiNorman, the former WBO welterweight beltholder from Atlanta who lost his title to Devin Haney in their much-hyped November showdown, helped take his name to the next level back in June when he defended his title in Tokyo against Jin Sasaki. The 25-year-old slugger, who kicked off 2025 with a third-round TKO of Derrieck Cuevas in March, returned just three months (and 7,000 miles) later to leave his mark inside the Ota City General Coliseum with an absolutely nasty one-punch knockout of Sasaki in Round 5. \nNorman built an early lead in the fight by scoring a pair of knockdowns in the opening round as he routinely exposed Sasaki's defensive gaps with powerful hooks. The action continued at close range as the fight progressed, with Sasaki unable to hurt Norman as the two continued to exchange punches in an increasingly exciting fight. But Sasaki's aggressive style caught up with him by Round 5. After Sasaki reached for a jab to the body, leaving his head exposed, Norman countered perfectly with a brutal left hook that dropped him in the center of the ring. The audible sound of Sasaki hitting the back of his head on the canvas could be heard on the broadcast as the impact knocked him out cold. Norman began instantly bowing to the crowd in celebration while standing in the neutral corner. Referee Gustavo Oliveiri, who picked up the count at five from the ringside timekeeper, suddenly realized there was no need to continue and waved off the bout at 46 seconds of the round. Norman showed good sportsmanship by dropping to his knees and bowing toward his fallen foe as medical responders rushed into the ring to attend to Sasaki. \nHonorable mentionsJai Opetaia def. Huseyin Cinkara: Opetaia defended his IBF and Ring Magazine cruiserweight titles against unheralded Cinkara in early December. While it would be difficult to get too excited about any win for Opetaia in a fight he was so heavily favored to win (upwards of +10000 at bell time), the champ found a way to make headlines in an expected victory. In the eighth round, Opeteia backed Cinkara toward the ropes before unloading with a left hand from his southpaw stance. The punch sent Cinkara crashing to the canvas, but not before he bounced off the ropes.\nDespite the resounding knockout, Opetaia was critical of his performance, saying, \"I feel like I just fought like shit, to be honest. You get these nights. We go back to the drawing board. I'm very disappointed in myself. I feel like I've let some people down with that performance. I made a lot of mistakes. I'm so pissed off.\"\nFabio Wardley def. Justis Huni: Heading into the 10th round of his fight with Huni, it looked like the momentum had run out of Wardley's time as an undefeated fighter. Huni, himself undefeated entering the bout, dominated the fight with slick, technical boxing. Not known as a tactician, Wardley proved that his power is the great equalizer in any fight as he landed a bomb of a right hand that dropped Huni to the canvas and brought the fight to a close midway through Round 10.Wardley would need to dig deep again in his next fight, scoring another late comeback knockout, this time against Joseph Parker to capture the interim WBO heavyweight championship in the biggest win of his career. Wardley has since been promoted to full champion after Oleksandr vacated the title. 2025 was a year that proved you can never count Wardley out at any point in a fight.\n            ",

Backup Crimson Tide quarterback Austin Mack entered the College Football Playoff quarterfinal in Simpson's place with Alabama trailing 24-0 in the third quarter. Simpson took a big hit in the first half while trying to extend for a first down and has been grimacing while throwing the ball. He tried to come back and play in the second half. The hit was on Simpson's lower back and led to a fumble, which the Hoosiers converted into points. However, Simpson has struggled to create explosive plays during a heavyweight battle with the Hoosiers. The junior completed 12-of-16 passes for 67 yards and added 17 yards on the ground, but was held without a score in his snaps. \"Ty had an injury, obviously, and he really wanted to try to go out there,\" Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said after the game. \"And we treated him there at halftime. He gave it a series.\n\"I know he feels like he let down the team, and there's no way that that's the case. He went out there, tried to battle. That's who he is, so I'm never going to let that be a thing where he let us down in any way. So making sure he knows that.\"Mack came off the bench and played good snaps in relief of Simpson, including leading the Crimson Tide's lone field goal drive. The California native completed 11-of-16 passes for 103 yards, but was also sacked multiple times in the loss. Mack's three drives averaged nearly eight plays per drive compared to only five for Simpson's drives. Alabama scored only three points in their loss to the Hoosiers, failing to reach multiple scores for the second time in three games. The Crimson Tide finished the year losing three of their final six games, including losing three of four against ranked opponents. \nAfter the win, No. 1 Indiana heads to face No. 5 Oregon at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are the final remaining undefeated team in college football, and hope to become the first 16-0 team in major college history. \n            \n    ",

Six months separate the United States men's national team from now and kicking off the World Cup on home soil, but Mauricio Pochettino has restored belief that this is a team that could make noise. They ended 2025 unbeaten in their last five matches, and Pochettino's plan and the depth of the side are shining in key areas.Excelling against Paraguay and Uruguay to end the year, the challenges will only get harder for the USMNT with Belgium and Portugal on the docket in March, but that's a good thing as players will be able to show what they can do against teams who will be in the mix to win the World Cup. That does mean that it's time for another World Cup roster prediction, as the end of the year has brought changes at the fringes of the side.Playing time concerns are still an issue in the squad with members such as Yunus Musah and Gio Reyna not playing consistently for their clubs, but with the tactical vision for the USMNT becoming clearer, let's take a look at predicting the roster as we're now six months out from the World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nUSMNT roster locksA section that has been dwindling as regression has hit the USMNT pool, this is a group of players who, if healthy, are still expected to be in the squad and likely start matches. \nGK Matt FreeseDEF Tim ReamDEF Chris RichardsDEF Antonee RobinsonDEF Sergino Dest MID Weston McKennieMID Tyler AdamsFWD Christian PulisicFWD Folarin BalogunOne group of players that hasn't changed is the locks of the squad. If these players are healthy, not only will they be in the World Cup squad, but they'll also be starting the first match for the USMNT, facing Paraguay on June 12 to kick off the tournament. It's a critical moment for the side, but if they're successful at the World Cup, this is the group who will need to be in top form to make it happen. It's not ideal that Tyler Adams is injured to begin the year, but he could be healthy by the March international break when the USMNT will face Portugal and Belgium as World Cup preparation kicks into high gear, but there is a very real possibility that the Bournemouth midfielder isn't at peak fitness when the World Cup kicks off which would be quite a blow to the national team. If someone were to fall out of this group, it'd possibly be Weston McKennie, who missed the September and October international breaks, but with him being back in the midfield rotation for Juventus, there's no reason why a performing McKennie won't be in the World Cup squad. Behind them, things are wide open, considering the lack of depth in defense. Malik Tillman is also probably a lock, but as another player who has had to come in and out of the USMNT squad due to injury, I hesitate to fully put him with this group of players.\nKeeper is also set unless something drastic happens, with no keeper earning a start under Pochettino, except Matt Freese during 2025. Despite Matt Turner getting consistent playing time since returning to the New England Revolution, it hasn't resulted in caps for the USMNT, so that only increases the chances that Freese is the number one when the World Cup gets underway.Players on the bubbleCristian Roldan (Midfielder): The Seattle Sounders man has not only showcased his leadership credentials with the USMNT, but he's also been an integral part of transitioning defense into attack when McKennie isn't in the squad. Now that he's gotten so much playing time under Pochettino while also representing the United States at the 2022 World Cup, it's hard to see a situation where Roldan doesn't make this squad.Roman Celentano (Goalkeeper): A strong performer for FC Cincinnati, Celentano is someone who has been called in under Pochettino, but due to Freese's form, it has kept him from doing much at the national team level.Miles Robinson (Defender): Holding down the Cincinnati defense in front of Celentano, Miles Robinson is someone who Pochettino values in defense. He may not start many games, but Robinson has been among the first names that Pochettino looks to to close out matches, which is a valuable skill.Malik Tillman (Midfielder): Even with the coaching change at Bayer Leverkusen, Tillman has stuck in the lineup while also shining with the USMNT when called into the squad. Injuries kept Tillman out for some of 2025, but moving into 2026, he's someone looking to claim a starting role at the World Cup.Auston Trusty (Defender): Another member of the team with a new coach heading into the new year, as Wilfred Nancy has taken over at Celtic, Trusty is looking to capitalize on the USMNT defense shifting to a back three. One of the defenders who has experience playing in that system, a steady time at Celtic could easily see him make the squad.Gio Reyna (Forward): When Gio Reyna scored for the USMNT against Paraguay, it felt like he made the World Cup squad. While he has yet to nail down a consistent starting role at Borussia Monchengladbach, he's still one of the most talented players in this squad, and Reyna being on the pitch makes things easier for the rest of the USMNT attackers. As long as he's playing regularly in Germany, Reyna will be in the squad.Tanner Tessemann (Midfielder): Thriving after his move to Lyon, Tessemann is someone who can fill multiple roles for the USMNT. He's gotten playing time as a defensive midfielder and as a centerback, versatility that could be key with the national team mixing things up tactically.Ricardo Pepi (Forward): Expected to start more matches for PSV than he has, Ricardo Pepi has made the most of his situation, scoring 10 goals in all competitions so far this season. Now linked to a move to Fulham, there's a chance that Pepi could be joining another American in Antonee Robinson. But, even if that doesn't happen, Pepi is in a situation where he can earn significant playing time and push to cement a role as one of the first players off the bench for the USMNT.Alex Freeman (Defender): Growing by the match under Pochettino, Freeman came from out of the blue, but he's knocking on the door of the World Cup. Showing his two-way skill as a wing back, Freeman is helping push Pochettino to take four fullbacks to the World Cup. Freeman hasn't met a challenge that he hasn't risen to, and he doesn't show signs of slowing down anytime soon.Haji Wright (Forward): With Coventry City flying atop the Championship, Wright is back to getting called into the national team setup on a regular basis. Able to play on the wing or as a traditional nine, Wright's versatility will be important for the USMNT going forward. Max Arfsten (Defender): Able to play as a defender or essentially push up the pitch as a wide midfielder, Arfsten is another player who brings important versatility to the squad. Robinson may be the starter at left back, but it doesn't get much better as far as a change of pace option go.Brenden Aaronson (Midfielder): The top assister for Leeds United this season, it seemed like Aaronson didn't have much of a shot at making the World Cup squad, but his work rate and vision have kept him around the fringes. Only time will tell if that's enough, but Aaronson is doing enough to ensure that he's in the mix right now.Patrick Schulte (Goalkeeper): Probably the best current keeper in the pool with the ball at his feet. If Schulte doesn't get injured ahead of the Gold Cup, Freese may never get his shot to start for the USMNT. With a strong season, Schulte could be the starter in net, but he's falling behind in the rankings.Mark McKenzie (Defender): A player who Pochettino has talked about the art of defending with, McKenzie is someone who could be a surprise starter at the World Cup. He has settled in well since making the move to Toulouse in France, and as another player who is comfortable in a back three or a back four, this could be McKenzie's time.Diego Luna (Midfielder): Becoming Pochettino's right-hand man, Luna now has to prove that he can perform against top opposition. Scoring against Uruguay is a start, but the tougher challenges are yet to come as his performances against Belgium and Portugal will go a long way to determining Luna's World Cup fate.Tim Weah (Forward): Back in France with Marseille, he has been able to play on the wing as well as at wing back, which is a boon for the USMNT. Pochettino has shuffled his position with the national team, but it doesn't feel like there's a scenario where Weah isn't in the squad, although he may not be a starter.Sebastian Berhalter (Midfielder): The Vancouver Whitecaps man has quickly become one of the best players in the squad at delivering set plays. His play on the pitch needs improvement to truly be at a USMNT level at the World Cup, but if someone needs to deliver a free kick or a corner to change the outcome of a game, there are worse options.Patrick Agyemang (Forward): Finding the back of the net for Derby County in the Championship, Agyemang is showing why Pochettino had faith in him. The forwards ahead of him are performing so this is a tenuous spot, but with players like Wright also being able to shift out wide, there's space for another out and out number nine.On the outside looking inHere's a look at those who have missed the cut in this projection:Yunus Musah (Midfielder): Now at Atalanta, Musah has struggled to stick in the starting lineup, and that has also kept him from pushing into Pochettino's plans, but there is still time for a late charge into the side.Jack McGlynn (Midfielder): Injuries have set McGlynn back, so priority one will be getting back to full health, but if he can do that, the Houston midfielder is talented enough to push for a place in the World Cup squad.Noahkai Banks (Defender): Called in by Pochettino but not yet receiving a cap, Banks is someone who the Argentine manager has spoken highly of. In a thin defense, Banks could turn up in the World Cup squad if he continues his strong form for Augsburg.Joe Scally (Defender): The shift to a back three and Scally's versatility will give him a chance, but if he's given opportunities against top teams, his performances for the national team will need to improve after a disappointing November window.Matt Turner (Goalkeeper): It feels like Turner will either be the starter for the USMNT or out of the squad with no in between. Back in New England, he's playing soccer, which is a start, but will there be enough time?Johnny Cardoso (Midfielder): Struggling to make his mark at Atletico Madrid, Cardoso has to be kept in the picture because if he does break into the XI, that would also be enough to earn a role with the USMNT.2026 roster projection Goalkeepers (3): Matt Freese (New York City FC), Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew).Defenders (9): Sergino Dest (PSV), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Tim Ream (Fulham), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Auston Trusty (Celtic),Mark McKenzie (Toulouse FC).\nMidfielders (7): Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Malik Tillman (Bayer Leverkusen), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders), Tanner Tessemann (Lyon).Forwards (7): Christian Pulisic (Milan), Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Ricardo Pepi (PSV), Tim Weah (Marseille), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Gio Reyna (Borussia Monchengladbach), Patrick Agyemang (Derby County).\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18, and they're going to have their quarterback back in the lineup. Lamar Jackson, who has been dealing with a back contusion, will play in the battle for the AFC North crown, he confirmed to reporters Thursday.\nJackson suffered the injury when he got kneed in the back in Week 16 against the New England Patriots and then missed Week 17 against the Green Bay Packers but was a full participant in both Wednesday's and Thursday's practices. He's on track to have his first full week of practice in nearly two months.Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson \"looked good\" at practice on Wednesday. On Thursday, Jackson said he \"feels great.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year, and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game the Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Packers.\n\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said Monday.After Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England. Furthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh.\nBut the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama's season started and ended with embarrassing losses. There were good moments in between, including a road playoff win over Oklahoma and a regular-season win against Georgia, but its season-opening 31-17 loss to Florida State (a team that finished 5-7) and the blowout 38-3 Rose Bowl loss to No. 1 Indiana are how the 2025 season will be remembered. In each of those losses, Alabama was the physically inferior team. They looked soft when it mattered most. In the Rose Bowl on Thursday afternoon, Indiana looked like those old Alabama teams under Nick Saban -- perfectly comfortable running the ball over and over until it came time for a big throw. Alabama fans know that style of play as \"joyless murderball,\" and it had to be bizarre seeing it deployed so successfully against the inept Crimson Tide this time around. Alabama made the wrong kind of history to begin the 2026 calendar year.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            Under former Saban disciple Curt Cignetti, Indiana resembled the old Alabama.This new Alabama under Kalen DeBoer needs to make some big changes moving forward. This was the kind of devastating, humiliating loss that must invoke introspection. The current blueprint is not going to cut it. Everything from roster construction to staffing to cultural identity should be under review this offseason. Is Ty Simpson the QB next year?Redshirt junior quarterback Ty Simpson will have an important decision to make soon on whether to return for another season or move on to the NFL. In recent CBS Sports mock drafts, experts Mike Renner, Blake Brockermeyer and Ryan Wilson all projected Simpson as a first-round pick. \nWhile only a one-year starter at Alabama after backing up Bryce Young and Jalen Milroe, Simpson is already 23-years-old. If he receives good early feedback, it could be difficult to say no to leaving for the NFL, especially with multiple offensive starters like Germie Bernard and Kadyn Proctor leaving the program. It will be interesting to see how Simpson is perceived, especially after struggling in the Rose Bowl and the SEC Championship. If Simpson is gone, Alabama should be aggressive in adding a viable transfer portal quarterback. There are 10 quarterbacks in the top 50 of 247Sports' portal rankings, including prominent names such as Florida's DJ Lagway, Nebraska's Dylan Raiola, TCU's Josh Hoover and Iowa State's Rocco Becht. If Alabama goes that path, it'll be costly -- $2 million and up for a surefire Power Four starter as CBS Sports recently reported -- but it's likely necessary given the alternatives. \n        \n            \n                What the transfer portal costs now: Position‑by‑position price ranges amid a market surge\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAustin Mack looked overwhelmed after coming into the game in place of an injured Simpson. Freshman Keelon Russell is a former five-star and highly regarded, but in what will be a critical year for DeBoer and his Alabama program, it'd be too risky a proposition to not bring in an experienced QB. \nDeBoer and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb need to discuss the situation with Simpson immediately now that the season is over. And if Simpson is on the way out, Alabama needs to move aggressively and decisively for its new offensive leader. Be more aggressive in the transfer portalRegardless of what happens at the QB position, Alabama needs to be more aggressive this transfer portal cycle. Alabama has prioritized high school players over transfer recruiting, which makes plenty of sense and is the more sustainable long-term strategy. The Tide signed the nation's No. 2 recruiting class in December, headlined by three five-star recruits. But Alabama nearly took a complacent approach to the portal last cycle. They added a few pieces, sure, but I heard from multiple personnel folks around college football who questioned Alabama not being more aggressive in adding impact players. As one Power Four personnel person told me, Alabama would end up being aggressive in the portal during Year 3 out of desperation when it should be proactively doing it in Year 2.\nAnd now, here we are. Even before the portal opens, Alabama is going to have some big holes to fill with the losses of leading receiver Germie Bernard, defensive linemen Tim Keenan and LT Overton, and its two leading tacklers in linebackers Deontae Lawson and Justin Jefferson. Alabama could desperately use upgrades along the offensive line, edge-rusher and running back. There is some potential value to be found at running back, but edge-rusher and offensive line will both be costly -- as Chris Hummer and I reported earlier this week, it'll cost more than $1 million for an elite pass-rusher or offensive tackle.)What choice does Alabama have, though? The run game was a massive liability all season, and it got exposed again against Indiana. Alabama was unwilling to spend up to get a top running back last cycle, opting instead to roll with Jam Miller and the rest of the returning backs after losing Justice Haynes to Michigan. That, obviously, didn't work out and can't be the strategy again going into 2026. Alabama badly needs to get bigger, stronger and tougher in the trenches. Some of those solutions could come from young talent already within the program, but there's no question that additional talent infusion is needed. Now is the time to deploy the financial resources available. \nHow will DeBoer handle the pressure?The timing of the interest from Penn State and Michigan in hiring DeBoer was complicated. If those jobs opened up a year from now, it would have been much clearer as to whether DeBoer was a true success at Alabama or not. He would have had a better sense of whether it was time to jump to a new situation or if he had it rolling well enough that his long-term job security in Tuscaloosa wasn't in question.Instead, it came amidst Alabama's first playoff run. The Michigan situation was especially tricky and there are still people who believe it would have gotten interesting had Alabama lost to Oklahoma in the first round.Now, DeBoer enters a critical third season at Alabama. And, no matter what he does, he stands in Saban's shadow. It's not just the fact that he followed Saban as Alabama's head coach. Look at the five teams still alive in the CFP -- Georgia, Indiana, Miami, Ole Miss and Oregon. A former Saban assistant/staffer is the head coach at every single one of them. Saban's legacy lives on in college football, and DeBoer is going to keep going up against head coaches like Cignetti who stood by Saban's side as he built college football's greatest dynasty. \nIs DeBoer the guy to lead Alabama back to a national championship? The Crimson Tide looked far away from that level in Pasadena. It'll be another long offseason for DeBoer, who must answer questions about whether the program is headed in the right direction. He made a significant staff change after Year 1 in hiring Ryan Grubb as offensive coordinator. That move didn't work out as well as expected with Grubb's maddening love of second-down run plays rearing its head again against the Hoosiers.Are there other big staff changes to be made? Does DeBoer need to prioritize different things with his program this offseason? He deserves credit for developing resiliency within this team, but it couldn't consistently display the toughness and ferocity that you expect out of Alabama teams. At the Rose Bowl, it was the other crimson team that played that way. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Napheesa Collier will be sidelined for four to six months after doctors determined that she needs to undergo surgery on both ankles, Unrivaled announced Thursday. Collier, who co-founded Unrivaled alongside Breanna Stewart, will not play in the 3-on-3 league's second season. She could also miss the start of the 2026 WNBA season depending on how her rehab goes and when (or if) the WNBA returns to the court this spring. Per ESPN, Collier will have surgery in New York during the first week of January. \"I am heartbroken to share that I will miss this Unrivaled season. I have fought hard over the last few months to be back with my Owls and was devastated to be told by my team of doctors that surgery was the best path forward,\" Collier, who plays for the Lunar Owls BC in Unrivaled, said in a statement on Instagram. \"I will still be cheering on my teammates every step of the way, and I will continue to work relentlessly with the rest of the players and our staff to push our sport forward and raise the bar for women's basketball.\"How was Collier injured?Collier dealt with significant ankle problems during the 2025 WNBA season, which ended in disastrous fashion for both her and the Minnesota Lynx. \nOn Aug. 2, late in the third quarter of the Lynx's blowout win over the Las Vegas Aces, Collier sprained her right ankle on a fastbreak with the team leading by 43 points. She would miss the next three weeks and played in just seven of the Lynx's final 15 games. At the time of the injury, Collier was far and away the MVP favorite, but her long-term absence contributed to her falling short in the MVP voting to Aces star A'ja Wilson, who won the award for the fourth time. With less than a minute to play in Game 3 of the Lynx's semifinal playoff series against the Phoenix Mercury, Collier tore three ligaments in her left ankle and a muscle in her left shin during a controversial collision with Alyssa Thomas. The Lynx, who went 34-10 to tie the single-season wins record and were the favorites to win the title, were eliminated in Game 4 while Collier watched from the sideline. During her Unrivaled media day session on Dec. 16, Collier told reporters that she would not need surgery for her ankle issues, but was \"still working to get back to 100%.\" Eventually, doctors determined that rehab would not be enough, and she will now go the surgical route. In retrospect, it may have been better for her to get the procedures shortly after the 2025 WNBA season came to a close in October. \nWhat does Collier's absence mean for Unrivaled?Collier was named MVP of Unrivaled's inaugural season in 2025, and her absence will be a major blow to the upstart league, which tips off its second season on Jan. 5. While Unrivaled enjoyed a successful inaugural season, the league has been unable to attract or retain some of the top stars in the sport. Notably, both Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson have declined to participate at all, while Angel Reese, Sabrina Ionescu and Jewell Loyd, all of whom played last season, chose not to return. Without Collier, the league will have even less star power this season. It will also no longer be able to rely on the newness factor to drive interest. \nFor the Lunar Owls, specifically, losing Collier ensures that they won't dominate the regular season like they did in 2025, when they went 13-1. Collier will be replaced by veteran center Temi Fágbénlé, who signed a multi-year contract with Unrivaled to play alongside Aaliyah Edwards, Rebecca Allen, Skylar Diggins, Marina Mabrey and Rachel Banham.  What does Collier's injury mean for her WNBA free agency?Collier is a WNBA free agent, along with nearly every other veteran, but is widely expected to return to the Lynx, who drafted her No. 6 overall in 2019, whenever the WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association come to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement. Collier is also a vice president in the WNBPA and has been at the forefront of the negotiations. If the two sides are able to get a deal done -- the new CBA deadline is Jan. 9, though it has already been pushed back twice and could be extended again -- and the 2026 WNBA season starts on time in mid-May, Collier could miss the beginning of the campaign. Her four-to-six-month timeline is very broad, though, and it's possible she could be back in time for opening night. \nEven though the 29-year-old Collier may miss some time in 2026, she should not lose any money due to her injuries. She has finished as the runner-up in MVP voting in each of the last two seasons, was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2024 and has made three consecutive All-WNBA First Team appearances. Collier should remain one of the league's best players for years to come, and the only real question for her this winter is how much the max contract she's eventually offered will be worth. \n            ",

Lake, 26, was on his way to another strong season -- he had his first career interception and also a career-high 10 passes defensed -- before injuring his elbow in Week 11 against the Seattle Seahawks. Rams coach Sean McVay said this week that the Rams will open Lake's 21-day practice window and that the team expects to have him back for the first round of the playoffs. Though he's listed as a safety, Lake has played two-thirds of his snaps this season as a slot cornerback. He is Pro Football Focus' 12th-highest graded safety this season, and the Rams have allowed 5.0 yards per play with him on the field compared to 5.4 yards per play with him off the field.\nThe Rams dropped to 11-5 with a loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Monday night and will close out the season at home against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. The Rams currently occupy the NFC's No. 6 seed, but would jump to the No. 5 spot with a win over the Cardinals and if the Seattle Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday.\n            \n    ",

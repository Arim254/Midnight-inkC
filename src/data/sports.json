Green, who \"significantly changed his physical appearance, presumably to avoid detection,\" eventually surrendered to authorities.Boyd was shot in the abdomen early on the morning of Nov. 16 in Manhattan after an argument. Boyd was previously listed in critical but stable condition, and CBS News reported that a bullet was lodged in his lung. The cornerback was released from the hospital sometime afterwards, and even surprised his teammates at the Jets' facilities last week. On the morning in question, investigators say that a group unknown to Boyd's entourage began \"taunting\" them outside a bar and restaurant on West 38th Street. That led to an altercation, where one of the men pulled out a gun and fired two shots. \nBoyd is currently on injured reserve after he hurt his shoulder over the summer, and has not suited up for the Jets this season. He has played in 81 career games for the Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans, recording 105 tackles, three pass defenses and two forced fumbles. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Milan -- The game is over, and Liverpool won 1-0 against Inter in Milan thanks to a controversial penalty, but the away end was only singing one name: Arne Slot. Normally, that wouldn't seem unusual, but given what has happened in recent days, it feels more significant than ever. It's clear the fans have made their stance known. It was an intense weekend for Liverpool manager Slot, who had to face the frustration of one of the most influential players in the recent history of the English giants going against the Dutch manager and the club. Mo Salah, one of the biggest stars of the team, went public after Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday and spoke openly about this moment.\"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame. I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship. I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club,\" he said. Since the bombshell interview became viral, many things happened. Salah wasn't included in the Liverpool squad traveling to Milan where the Reds faced Inter on Tuesday at the San Siro, a decision that was agreed by Slot and the club, while the manager seemed annoyed but also clear in his words when he was asked his opinion on the matter ahead of Tuesday's match.\"I have no clue if he played his last match with Liverpool. I am a firm believer there is always a possibility for a player to return. But if he has the right to share it with the media, then we have to react with it. So he's out,\" Slot said.\nOn Tuesday morning, few hours before kickoff of such an important match for the Reds that are not facing their best moment, Salah posted on his social media a picture of him training alone at the club, and a few minutes before the Liverpool match started, the CBS Sports crew spoke on the matter, with Thierry Henry believing he made a mistake.\"When I was at Barcelona, I went away with the team. They put me in the stands. Did you hear me talking about it? No … We won the treble the year before but I wasn't performing so if you're not performing, you put yourself in the situation where you leave the door open for someone to [get] in. I traveled, we arrived at the stadium, I'm in the stands. Am I going to make a fuss about it? Am I going to make it about myself? Am I going to talk to the press after? I have achieved stuff in the game but team first. If I had to say something – and by the way, I said it. I said it to [manager] Pep [Guardiola], what I thought about what was happening, but not publicly,\" he said. The game was pretty even, and Liverpool showed they are still in control of their future, even if they didn't play their best game, especially for how the penalty was awarded for a weak foul of Alessandro Bastoni on Florian Wirtz. But what emerged from the match at San Siro was how the fans reacted and chanted the name of Slot twice, once before and once right after Tuesday's win after the final whistle.\nSalah will travel for the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Egypt on Dec. 15, and if they advance to the final, he wouldn't return to Liverpool until after Jan. 18, when the winter transfer window will be open. His future is in doubt and we don't really know what will happen in the coming weeks, but for sure Liverpool fans know where they stand and this time they have decided to take the side of Slot, the Dutch manager who won the Premier League in first season at the club and replaced club icon Jurgen Klopp in the summer of 2024. That may feel ages ago, but after a rough beginning to the season, perhaps this is the start of a new chapter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.Among other things, December in the baseball world is the time to discuss the Baseball Hall of Fame. There's an Era Committee vote and BBWAA Hall of Fame ballots are due by Dec. 31. And discussing the Hall of Fame these days means fights on social media platforms. Everything is so dramatic and needlessly dialed all the way up to 100. First off, no, the Hall of Fame most certainly isn't a \"joke\" just because it doesn't have everything perfectly how you want it.Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens aren't in, which means it's a joke!Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens don't deserve to be in and it's a joke that they're even being discussed!\nJeff Kent made the Hall of Fame. What a joke. It's a joke that Kent wasn't already in since he's the all-time leader in home runs by a second baseman. Yeah, but it was already a joke when Scott Rolen got in, so whatever.You clown, Rolen definitely deserved to make it!It's embarrassing that Fred McGriff got in but Dale Murphy and Don Mattingly can't make it! Murphy and Mattingly are Hall of the Very Good types, they don't belong! Oh, and of course, \"writers shouldn't vote for this.\" Yeah, we should. No, we didn't play in the majors, but we're the ones who study the statistics and also talk to players about their peers. If you don't think we're qualified, you're entitled to your opinion, but who is? The players? You throw fits every year about the All-Star Game selections that the players make. \nAnother thing that needs to go is when people say, \"this doesn't make any sense\" just because they disagree. For example, my line drawn on any PED-related player is that I won't vote for him if he was suspended by the league once there was a Joint Drug Agreement in place. If not, fair game. So I would've been a yes on Bonds and Clemens and I'm a no on A-Rod. Even if you don't like the argument, which is totally fair and fine, you don't get to tell me that \"it doesn't make sense.\" Yes, it does. You just disagree with my stance. There's a difference. It's a microcosm of the larger issue at hand here. So many people have decided that their opinion is the correct one and anyone who disagrees is ignorant or nefarious or doesn't deserve a vote or whatever. How about a little respectful disagreement? I think Kent is a perfectly defensible Hall of Fame selection. He was one of the greatest sluggers ever among second basemen. His WAR is a bit less than average for a Hall of Famer at the position, but there's room for all types of Hall of Famers. Yes, I believe Bobby Grich and Lou Whitaker should be in, but they weren't on this ballot. That doesn't make the system broken. It makes it imperfect. \nWhile we're here, let's also discuss a subsection of people who will make a point to tell you how much they definitely don't even care about the Hall of Fame. It's perfectly fine if you don't care about it, but a word to the wise: If you don't care about something, you don't spend hours arguing about it. For example, I don't care about, say, soap operas. So I never discuss them. See? It's easy. If you don't care, get outta here and stop talking about it.Anyway ... I saw a bunch of people pointing out that Bonds was getting walked so many times -- many intentionally -- because teams in the early 2000s would rather face Kent than Bonds. That's a fair point in favor of Bonds. I don't think it detracts from Kent at all because Bonds in those years was the greatest hitter in the history of the sport. No team would have rather faced Bonds than any other player.And if you disagree with me and think Kent is not a defensible selection, that's fine. I respect your stance. \nI don't respect the nonstop negativity about the Hall of Fame process, again, just because it isn't perfectly tailored to what you think it is supposed to be. People lecture me on social media about this all the time. \"The Hall of Fame isn't supposed to be ... \" or \"the Hall of Fame is supposed to be ... \"No, you don't get to decide that. Neither do I. What I do get to decide is to tell everyone to stop whining so much about a museum. You don't need to see plaques for Bonds and Clemens to know how great they were and you sure aren't harmed by plaques for McGriff and Rolen and Kent and Harold Baines. \nThe Baseball Hall of Fame is positive in nature. I like it. I like discussing it. Please join me in positivity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The University of Utah is finalizing a landmark private equity partnership that would be the first of its kind in college athletics. Utah is set to enter an agreement with New York-based firm Otro Capital that will help generate an estimated $500 million for the school, it announced on Tuesday. The deal is expected to be finalized in early 2026.Utah received clearance from the NCAA to enter the partnership, according to Yahoo Sports. It must abide by certain stipulations to remain an NCAA member, though. For instance, university president Taylor Randall and athletic director Mark Harlan must retain majority decision-making control.With the groundbreaking deal comes the creation of a for-profit entity, Utah Brands & Entertainment LLC, which will exist as an independent offshoot of the athletic department co-owned by the university and Otro Capital. The school will be the majority owner and possess decision-making authority (including on schedules, coaches and other pertinent factors) while Otro Capital earns a percentage of the company's annual revenue.The agreement comes with an exit strategy five to seven years down the line, and the university possesses the right to purchase Otro Capital's ownership stake.Utah Brands & Entertainment will oversee the revenue-sharing efforts with Utes athletes. Harlan is set to chair its board, which will elect a president from outside the university. Personnel, divisions and operations that were traditionally under the athletic department's umbrella will largely exist as part of the new company.\nDonors will also be able to purchase stakes in Utah Brands & Entertainment. Between the investments from donors and a nine-figure deal with Otro Capital, Utah could raise more than $500 million, setting itself up for sustained success in the revenue-sharing era of college athletics.Utah becomes first school to embrace private equityThe House v. NCAA case paved the way for private equity to enter college athletics, and as soon as the parties agreed in 2024 to settle, schools and conferences began to investigate opportunities in that realm. But even six months after the settlement was finalized, none had secured deals. Utah is the first to ink a partnership with a capital firm, and it will surely not be the last. As universities and leagues seek first-mover advantages and guarantees of long-term success in the rapidly changing college athletics landscape, more figure to follow Utah's lead.Florida State was among the first schools to consider private equity investments, but nothing came of the idea. Entire conferences later brought proposals to the table. The Big 12 considered an option that could have raised up to $1 billion for the league in exchange for 20% ownership but decided against it. The Big Ten is in the middle of similar discussions, but not all of its schools are on board with what could be a $2 billion deal.\nThe more revenue a school's athletic department generates, the more it can allocate to its athletes. That is the new reality in the post-House settlement era. With deeper pockets comes a greater ability to recruit and retain talent and, thus, to compete for championships. If Utah's model proves successful, private equity investments will almost certainly become far more common in the years to come.\n            ",

During a recent appearance on the Sports Media Podcast with Richard Deitsch, Aikman -- the UCLA quarterback who went on to a Hall of Fame career with the Dallas Cowboys -- recounted the specific instance that turned him off from donating NIL money. \"I gave money to a kid, I won't mention who,\" Aikman said. \"I've done it one time at UCLA, never met the young man. He was there a year, he left after the year. I wrote a sizable check, and he went to another school. I didn't even get so much as a thank you note. So, it's one of those deals, to where I'm done with NIL. I want to see UCLA be successful, but I'm done with it.\"Aikman, currently the color analyst for \"Monday Night Football,\" did acknowledge that athletes should be allowed to leave a school whenever a coach does. given that programs often change dramatically in times of transition. But he also called for further guardrails with NIL legislation. \n\"There's got to be some leadership at the very top that kind of cleans all of this up,\" Aikman said. \"Starting with players that accept money. There's got to be some accountability and responsibility on their behalf, to have to stick to a program.\"\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Indiana heads to CFP as unanimous No. 1, Georgia leaps Texas Tech in college football rankings\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAikman, who was a three-time Super Bowl champion and a six-time Pro Bowler in the NFL, starred with the Bruins from 1986-88.

    "body": "\n        Counted out by many following a disastrous stretch in which he lost three of four fights and his UFC bantamweight title, Petr Yan never gave up hope that a return to the top of the 135-pound division was inevitable. Yan, the 32-year-old native of Russia, completed his impressive turnaround last weekend at UFC 323 in Las Vegas when he extended his current win streak to four by upsetting Merab Dvalishvili to reclaim the bantamweight crown via unanimous decision. The victory wasn't merely surprising because of the hot streak Dvalishvili was riding as the most accomplished bantamweight champion in UFC history who was riding an incredible 14-fight win streak and on the verge of potentially securing history as the first champion to make four title defenses in a single calendar year (which would've cemented \"The Machine\" as consensus fighter of the year). What was most shocking was the ease in which Yan appeared to shut Dvalishvili down in every aspect of the game.Two years after Yan, who was battling a broken hand, dropped a decision to Dvalishvili in their non-title bout, he returned as an even more well-rounded fighter by switching stances and outboxing the defending champion (while damaging his face in the process). Yan also routinely stuffed the takedowns of Dvalishvili while scoring five of his own. \nThe most impressive part of the performance, however, was the fact that Yan became the first Dvalishvili opponent to truly match him in the cardio department over 25 minutes. Yan was in command throughout as he showcased just how well he and his team did in auditing Dvalishvili's game to limit his effectiveness. Dvalishvili called for an immediate trilogy fight after the loss but given how dominant Yan truly was, there may not be a need for it just yet. Yan, who initially lost his title by disqualification against Aljamain Sterling in 2021 (before losing a pair of elite bouts shortly after by disputed split decision), is back on top and seemingly better than ever.UFC 323 was a shining example of just how hard it truly is to maintain a lengthy run atop any division as losses to P4P-ranked champions Dvalishvili and Alexandre Pantoja left Valentina Shevchenko, who has made two title defenses in her second reign as women's flyweight champion, as the longest reigning titleholder of any division at the moment. \nMen's pound-for-pound rankings1. Islam Makhachev -- Welterweight championRecord: 28-1 | Previous ranking: No. 1Makhachev turned UFC 322 in November into a night of historical conquest as the former lightweight champion dominated Jack Della Maddalena with his grappling over five rounds to become the 11th two-division champion in UFC history. The 34-year-old also equaled Anderson Silva's record for consecutive wins with 16. Makhachev now must deal with a hungry group of contenders in the sport's deepest division at 170 pounds. \n2. Ilia Topuria -- Lightweight championRecord: 17-0 | Previous ranking: No. 2Topuria took a massive step forward in becoming the new face of the promotion by knocking out Charles Oliveira at UFC 317 in June to capture the vacant lightweight title. The first unbeaten, two-division champion in UFC history just might have the most technical and explosive boxing skills the Octagon has ever seen. Topuria announced he will take some time off to open 2026 in order to deal with personal issues.3. Alex Pereira -- Light heavyweight championRecord: 13-3 | Previous ranking: No. 4Talk about a comeback victory. The 37-year-old Brazilian slugger had looked sluggish in a decision loss against the technical Magomed Ankalaev in March. Vowing to return at full health after competing at just 40% of himself, Pereira wasted no time in finishing Ankalaev in their October rematch at UFC 320 to regain the title and call for a much-anticipated move up to heavyweight and a third title in as many divisions.\n4. Khamzat Chimaev -- Middleweight championRecord: 15-0 | Previous ranking: No. 5Despite years of inactivity due to injury, illness and bad luck, Chimaev proved at UFC 319 in August just how dangerous he truly is when fully healthy. He also shut up any critics wondering if he possessed five-round cardio by utterly dominating Dricus du Plessis on the ground in a shutout decision. While many fans referred to the gameplan that Chimaev executed against DDP as boring, the performance sent a stern message to the rest of the pack at 185 pounds that Chimaev is ready to begin a new era.5. Petr Yan -- Bantamweight championRecord: 20-5 | Previous ranking: NRThe former 135-pound champion completed an incredible comeback after losing three of four fights from 2021 to 2023. Yan brought a three-fight win streak into his UFC 323 rematch against Merab Dvalishvili in December and outright dominated the defending champion in every aspect to claim a unanimous decision (and retribution). At 32, the native of Russia appears reborn and even more well-rounded than his first title run, which began in 2020 and lasted only eight months. 6. Alexandre Pantoja -- FlyweightRecord: 30-6 | Previous ranking: No. 6In what amounted to nothing more than a case of bad luck at the wrong time, Panotja badly injured his left elbow just 26 seconds into his UFC 323 title defense in December against Joshua Van when he put his arm down to catch himself after being thrown and immediately lost his flyweight title due to the fight being called off because of the gruesome injury. At 35, with a long layoff likely in his future, it's hard to say exactly where Pantoja goes from here and whether he will return to his previous stature. \n7. Alexander Volkanovski -- Featherweight championRecord: 27-4 | Previous ranking: No. 7A 14-month layoff did the 36-year-old Volkanovski good as he rebounded from a pair of knockout losses to the two best fighters in the world by brilliantly outpointing Diego Lopes to capture the vacant 145-pound title at UFC 314 in April. Now a two-time champion, Volkanovski proved, even this late in his career, that skills, IQ and timing can still defeat youth and power. A rematch with Diego Lopes will headline UFC 325 in Australia on Jan. 31.8. Dricus du Plessis -- MiddleweightRecord: 22-3 | Previous ranking: No. 8As impressive as du Plessis' first nine trips to the Octagon truly were, he proved quickly out of answers in yielding his middleweight title to unbeaten Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 319 in August. DDP simply had nothing for Chimaev on the ground and looked like a novice despite showing toughness and a willingness to keep fighting. A late rally in the closing seconds, aided by two referee standups, wasn't enough to save face in a one-sided dismantling.9. Tom Aspinall -- Heavyweight championRecord: 15-3 (1 NC) | Previous ranking: No. 9The 32-year-old British slugger with some of the fastest hands the division has seen finally earned undisputed champion status when Jon Jones vacated his title and briefly retired earlier this year. Aspinall, who previously defended his interim title last summer, returned in October to defend the belt against Cyril Gane at UFC 321. Unfortunately, a double eye poke late in Round 1 compromised Aspinall's vision and led to a no contest. His return remains uncertain as the possibility of surgery on both eyes awaits him.\n10. Merab Dvalishvili -- BantamweightRecord: 21-5 | Previous ranking: No. 3In hindsight, was \"The Machine\" overly ambitious in attempting to become the first UFC champion to make four title defenses in a calendar year? It's hard to say. What we can say is that Dvalishvili was thoroughly dominated by Petr Yan in their UFC 323 rematch in December, which cost the native of Georgia not just 135-pound title and fighter of the year honors but it also brought an end to his 14-fight win streak. After the loss, Dvalishvili called for an immediate trilogy.Dropped out: Umar NurmagomedovJust missed: Nurmagomedov, Shavkat Rakhkmonov, Magomed Ankalaev, Jack Della Maddalena, Joshua Van (c)Women's pound-for-pound rankings1. Valentina Shevchenko -- Flyweight championRecord: 26-4-1 | Previous ranking: No. 1If there was any lingering debate as to who was most deserving of being called the pound-for-pound queen, Shevchenko reminded us of her greatness at UFC 322 in November by relying on her grappling to completely neutralize two-time strawweight champion Weili Zhang. The only question now for the 37-year-old is whether she will move back up to 135 pounds to seek a second UFC title and deeper consideration within the G.O.A.T. debate.\n2. Kayla Harrison -- Bantamweight championRecord: 19-1 | Previous ranking: No. 2Despite enduring an insane cut to make championship weight of 135 pounds, Harrison dominated two-time champion Juianna Pena at UFC 316 in June to capture the women's bantamweight title. A showdown against former champion (and former teammate) Amanda Nunes is up next and will serve as the co-main event to UFC 324 in January. Harrison has also said she would love to fight Valentina Shevchenko at the White House in June. 3. Zhang Weili -- Strawweight/FlyweightRecord: 26-4 | Previous ranking: No. 3After two title reigns at strawweight, the 35-year-old Chinese star vacated her title in search of cementing her legacy by moving up to flyweight. Unfortunately for Zhang, her attempt to capture a world title in a second division came up definitively short in a wide 5-round decision loss to Valentina Shevchenko. Zhang was soundly dominated by the grappling and defensive skills of her larger foe and now must decide whether to stay at 125 pounds or move back down. 4. Manon Fiorot -- FlyweightRecord: 13-2 | Previous ranking: No. 4The 35-year-old native of France snapped an impressive 7-0 start to her UFC career by coming up just short in a close decision loss to champion Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 315 in June. But, to Fiorot's credit, her October return against a streaking Jasmine Jasudavicius was a stark reminder at how talented and title-ready she remains. Fiorot recorded a first-round TKO in a showcase of her explosive boxing skills.\n5. Natalia Silva -- FlyweightRecord: 19-5-1 | Previous ranking: No. 5Unbeaten in seven trips to the Octagon, Silva earned a decision in May at UFC 315 against former champion Alexa Grasso to put the 28-year-old native of Brazil in position for a possible title shot. The dynamic striker has won 13 fights in a row overall since a 2017 loss on the regional scene to Marina Rodriguez. In January, she returns on short notice to face former two-time strawweight queen Rose Namajunas at UFC 324 in Las Vegas.Dropped out: NoneJust missed: Maycee Barber, Erin Blanchfield, Mackenzie Dern (c), Julianna Pena, Tatiana Suarez\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The White Sox, with the highest odds at 27.73%, won the No. 1 overall pick in next summer's draft during Tuesday's lottery at the Winter Meetings in Orlando. It will be Chicago's first No. 1 selection since taking Hall of Famer Harold Baines in 1977 and their third No. 1 pick overall (also Danny Goodwin in 1971).\"An opportunity to boost what we have going on right now,\" White Sox GM Chris Getz said about winning the lottery. \"It's an honor. A huge responsibility.\"MLB and the MLBPA agreed to the lottery as part of the current collective bargaining agreement in an effort to reduce tanking and anti-competitive behavior. The 18 non-postseason teams are eligible for the lottery, though the worst teams have the best odds. Only the first six picks are chosen via lottery. Here are the six lottery teams and their No. 1 pick odds:White Sox (27.73%)Rays (3.03%)Twins (22.18%)Giants (1.01%)Pirates (16.81%)Royals (0.84%)Picks 7-18 are the remaining non-postseason teams in reverse order of the standings, and picks 19-30 are the 12 postseason teams in order of their finish (Wild Card Series losers first, World Series winner last, etc.). The 2026 Draft will be held in Philadelphia during next summer's All-Star break. UCLA shortstop Roch Cholowsky is the early favorite to be the No. 1 pick.\n\n        \n            \n                White Sox win No. 1 pick in MLB Draft Lottery: Five contenders to go first overall, including UCLA's shortstop\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith the lottery complete, here now is the complete first round order for the 2026 MLB draft, plus some winners and losers from the lottery.2026 MLB Draft first round orderWhite SoxRaysTwinsGiantsPiratesRoyalsOriolesAthleticsBravesRockiesNationalsAngelsCardinalsMarlinsDiamondbacksRangersAstrosRedsGuardiansRed SoxPadresTigersCubsMarinersBrewersBraves (Prospect Promotion Incentive pick for Drake Baldwin winning Rookie of the Year)MetsThe Blue Jays, Dodgers, Phillies, and Yankees had their top draft picks moved back 10 spots via competitive balance tax penalties, pushing them out of the first round. The Dodgers moved from No. 30 to No. 40. The Blue Jays moved from No. 29 to No. 39. The Phillies moved from No. 26 to No. 36. The Yankees moved from the No. 25 to No. 35. The Mets had their top pick moved back for the same reason, though they technically stayed within the first round.Also, that is the order for the first round only. In the second round, it goes back to the reverse order of this year's standings, so the 43-119 Rockies have the first pick of the second round, the 60-102 White Sox have the second pick of the second round, etc.\nWinner: White SoxGet the No. 1 pick and you're automatically a winner. Sure, the White Sox had the highest odds for the No. 1 pick, but they're the first team in the four years of the Draft Lottery to get the No. 1 pick with the highest odds. Chicago is still fairly early in a very deep rebuild. The No. 1 pick next summer will accelerate things nicely.Winners: RaysThe Rays were the biggest mover in the lottery, jumping from the No. 7 pick all the way to No. 2 through the lottery. It will be their highest pick since taking Tim Beckham with the No. 1 pick in 2008. In just about every sport, the first two or three picks of the draft are far more valuable than, say, the No. 6-8 picks. Tampa's expected outcome for next year's first rounder jumped considerably.Loser: RockiesDespite losing 17 more games than any other team in 2025, the Rockies did not have a chance to win the No. 1 pick in the lottery. That's because teams can not pick in the lottery more than two years in the row. Colorado had the No. 3 pick in 2024 and the No. 4 pick in 2025, which made them ineligible for the No. 1 pick (and a top-six pick in general) in 2026. So, their reward for those 119 losses is the No. 10 pick next summer. Ouch.\nWinner: Giants and RoyalsThe 2014 World Series clubs went into the lottery with the 12th- and 13th-best odds, respectively, and although neither won the lottery, they made a huge jump into the top six. The Giants went from No. 12 to No. 4 and the Royals went from No. 13 to No. 6. Moving up that much shifts the draft calculus significantly, and not just because they're picking higher. They now have more money to spend too.\nLoser: CardinalsNot a huge loser, but a loser. Some team was going to take a hit with both the Giants and Royals moving into the lottery and that team is the Cardinals. They got bumped back from the No. 8 pick to the No. 13 pick. Five spots doesn't sound like much, but it is a pretty big ding that early in the draft. A pick in the top 10 is much more valuable than than one closer to No. 15.\n            ",

Kylian Mbappe scores goals. Twenty-five in 21 club games this season, to be precise. It was against Manchester City nearly nine years ago that the then-Monaco forward first showed his prodigious talents and he has rarely let up on them since, netting a brilliant hat trick to knock them out of last season's Champions League. -- James BengeMan of the match: Jeremy Doku, Manchester City -- Pep Guardiola is back at the Bernabeu again playing against Real Madrid, the fourth most-faced team in his coaching career after Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. The Citizens are in great form and are back in contention for the Premier League as well while Real Madrid are facing a crisis with only one win in the last five LaLiga games (three draws, one win, one defeat). The pace and the technique of Doku can definitely become a big issue for the team managed by Xabi Alonso. -- Francesco Porzio\nPrediction: Real Madrid 1, Manchester City 2 -- He may have started the job a few months ago, but it's already time to talk about Xabi Alonso's job security, momentum perhaps swinging in Manchester City's favor ahead of the most anticipated game on Matchday 6. Momentum is not the only reason to pick City -- flawed as they are in Pep Guardiola's latest rebuild, the ideas seem to be clicking more often than not, plus Erling Haaland's always impressive form always makes them a contender. --  Pardeep CattryBest bet: Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland to have 2+ shots on target (+164): Back your stars? Both of these teams are in a bit of a rut but they'll look to get their star strikers shots to get out of them. Mbappe has continued to score no matter what happens with the club, and City's only option is to feed Haaland, so let's back them.-- Chuck BoothLeverkusen vs. NewcastlePlayer to watch: Bruno Guimaraes, Newcastle -- After Alexander Isak's departure, Eddie Howe needed others to step up and share a scoring load that would have weighed too strongly on Nick Woltemade otherwise. Guimaraes has certainly done that, his five increasingly impressive goals so far this season, culminating in a wicked corner that swerved straight in in Saturday's 2-1 win over Burnley. That Guimaraes has the quality to impose himself on Leverkusen's talented midfield only makes it more important that he excels at the Bay Arena. -- James BengeMan of the match: Patrick Schick, Bayer Leverkusen -- The German side has had some ups and down in the past weeks, but also won 2-0 in their last Champions League tie against Manchester City, one of the most surprising results of the season so far. Facing Newcastle at home, they have an immense chance to score some big points ahead of the next phase. Patrick Schick is in great form and has already scored two goals in the three Champions League matches he played so far. -- Francesco PorzioPrediction: Bayer Leverkusen 0, Newcastle United 1 -- It has been an up and down season for both of these teams, who are likely to keep things tight in a closely-contested game. Newcastle United, though, have the quality needed to take all three points home with them, calling upon the likes of Nick Woltemade and Anthony Gordon to get the job done in attack. --  Pardeep Cattry\nBest bet: Under 2.5 goals (+110): With Leverkusen finding their feet, this is a hard matchup to pick, but it could turn into a defensive slugfest. Newcastle United have only allowed more than one goal in three of their last 11 games so it's safe to say that Leverkusen will struggle to score, but the Magpies' attack has also struggled to get things going. -- Chuck Booth\n            ",

Congratulations. Now, the age-old question must be answered: Do you start the guys who got you here or play the matchups and the projections? Nowhere is that question more polarized than in the case of Jacoby Brissett.Brissett has made eight starts this season, and he has scored at least 20 Fantasy points in each. In seven of those eight starts, he has scored at least 23 Fantasy points. Since Week 6 only Josh Allen, Matthew Stafford, and Drake Maye have outscored him. Brissett has thrown 40 passes in six of those starts and thrown two touchdown passes in seven of them. He's also added a cool 2.5 points per game with his rushing. In other words, he seems like a bulletproof QB1. Enter the Houston Texans.The Texans have given up a league-low 12.23 Fantasy points per game to opposing QBs. They just held Patrick Mahomes to five. Josh Allen scored eight two weeks ago. Only three QBs have scored 20 Fantasy points against them all season and none have scored more than 23. While Brissett has produced against the Seahawks, Paackers, and Rams, none of them have been at the Texans level of shutting down opposing QBs.This may seem like a draw, and if it is, we may have gotten the tiebreaker. Star tackle Paris Johnson has a sprained MCL and is week to week. If he is out against this pass rush, it gets easier to justify sitting Brissett. There are two QBs available on the waiver wire that I would start over Brissett. Of course you may have to fight the Daniel Jones manager over them. More on those players below. Let's get to the rest of the Week 15 preview:\n\n        Week 15 QB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            12.62 -- The Chargers are the only defense within a point of the Texans in terms of preventing Fantasy points. They face Patrick Mahomes this week.7.5 -- Shedeur Sanders' 7.4 yards per pass attempt leads all rookie QBs.405 -- Patrick Mahomes leads all QBs with 405 scramble yards.49.0 -- Since Week 6 Jacoby Brissett leads the NFL with 49 drop backs per game. Joe Burrow is second at 43.4 -- Jaxson Dart had a season-low four rush attempts in Week 13. We'll be watching to see if that is a blip or a trend.8.1% -- Matthew Stafford leads the NFL with an 8.1% TD rate. That should signal regression, but maybe not since he also leads the league in red zone pass attempts and pass attempts inside the 10.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB

If he doesn't, Marcus Mariota is the clear top streamer. He has topped 20 Fantasy points in two of his last three starts, has Terry McLaurin back, and still has rushing ability to boost his floor and his upside. The Giants have given up the third-most Fantasy points to opposing QBs. The last four QBs they have faced have topped 20 Fantasy points and eight QBs in a row have scored 19 or more against them.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #7\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -9.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                58%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2181\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    194\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    16.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Stroud's play has been better than his Fantasy production but he is at home against Arizona and I think he has a good chance to get you to 19 or 20 Fantasy points. I would not start him over Brissett, but he's an excellent Daniel Jones replacement. I would start him against Bo Nix, who faces the Packers.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    DFS Plays\n                \n                    \n            Top DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAR\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

He is at home against a Lions defense that is better against the run than the pass. This game has an over/under of 54.5 and the Lions have an implied total of 30. He's the fifth highest priced QB on FanDuel, $1,000 cheaper than QB1 Josh Allen. I would not be surprised at all if Stafford outscores him.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 15 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Four years after being fired by LSU, Ed Orgeron has not been shy about his desire to get back into coaching.Plenty has changed in the college football landscape in those years, most notably players being able to get paid via name, image and likeness deals and now through revenue sharing directly from the schools themselves. That's an adjustment every coach has had to make, and some have adapted to the new way of the college football world better than others. In a recent appearance on \"Bussin' With The Boys,\" Orgeron joked that after all his years coaching in the SEC, paying players via NIL will only require a \"minor adjustment.\"\n\"They say, 'Hey coach, you been out of coaching for awhile. How you gonna adjust to NIL?' Orgeron said. \"I said, well, it's a minor adjustment. 'What do you mean?' Well, back then we used to walk through the back door with the cash. Now we just gotta walk through the front door with the cash.\"Orgeron has long been known as an elite recruiter and that's not a title one could get without knowing how to get things done in the shadows. Now all those conversations and negotiations happen above the table, and Orgeron is pretty confident he can make that small adjustment if he were to land back on a sideline soon. \nOrgeron, of course, coached LSU to a national title in 2019 but was let go following the 2021 season. In all, Orgeron had a 51-20 record leading LSU, but went just 11-11 combined in the two years following the national championship. He has not coached since, but the 64-year-old is looking to get back in the action -- perhaps even back in Baton Rouge with the Tigers. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe Colorado Avalanche proved they weren't infallible during Week 9 of the 2025-26 NHL season as they sustained their first regulation loss in more than a month. However, the defeat wasn't enough to supplant the Avalanche from the top spot in this week's ratings.Colorado, which suffered its first regulation loss of the campaign on Oct. 25, a 3-2 setback against the Boston Bruins, entered Week 9 with a point streak that it extended to 17 games (14-0-3) with last Tuesday's 3-1 triumph over the Vancouver Canucks. The club stumbled at the start of its four-game road trip, allowing the first four goals of its contest against the New York Islanders en route to a 6-3 loss but quickly got back on course with 3-2 victories against the New York Rangers in overtime and Philadelphia Flyers.The Vegas Golden Knights were the only team with a perfect record in Week 9, winning all three of their games, while the Dallas Stars, Washington Capitals, Detroit Red Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs all went 3-0-1. Meanwhile, the New Jersey Devils' struggles without Jack Hughes continued as they scored a total of one goal while losing three contests last week to extend their losing streak to five games after having won four of their first seven without the star forward.No team had a worse week than the Tampa Bay Lightning, who lost four games and were shut out in the last two. The slide caused the Lightning to drop out of this week's top 10 after a seven-game winning streak helped put them in the No. 3 spot last week.Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings after Week 9 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 9 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (3-1-0 in Week 9; 21-2-6 overall)Yes, the Avalanche showed they were human in Week 9, but they also demonstrated that they still are the best team in the NHL this season with three more victories. Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar also kept chugging along as they each recorded at least one point in three of Colorado's four games, and both have landed on the scoresheet in 24 of the club's 29 contests in 2025-26. The 2024 Hart Trophy winner, MacKinnon posted a pair of two-goal performances and also notched an assist to increase his league-leading totals to 24 tallies and 49 points. Meanwhile, two-time Norris Trophy recipient Makar set up three goals as he raised his season numbers to 26 assists and 35 points, both of which are tops among NHL defensemen. Martin Necas' efforts cannot be overlooked, as the 26-year-old Czech center had a goal and five assists last week, has registered four multi-point performances in his last seven games and is tied for fifth in the league with 39 points. The Avs are 11-0-2 at home this season and play two of their three Week 10 contests at Ball Arena, so we probably can expect them to occupy the top spot of the ratings again next week.2. Dallas Stars (3-0-1; 20-5-5)The Stars' week couldn't have gotten off to a worse start as they squandered a late lead and dropped a 3-2 decision to the New York Rangers in overtime, a setback that ended their four-game winning streak. In addition, they lost Tyler Seguin for what likely will be the remainder of the season to a torn ACL. But Dallas displayed its resiliency, winning its final three contests of the week to extend its points streak to 10 games (8-0-2). Mikko Rantanen collected three goals and three assists over the team's four outings and enters Week 10 with a six-game point streak, while Jason Robertson scored in two contests to give him goals in 11 of his last 14. Defenseman Miro Heiskanen has tallied in three straight games, Roope Hintz (points in eight of his last nine) and Wyatt Johnston (points in five of his last six) both are hot and captain Jamie Benn has racked up nine points in 11 outings after missing the Stars' first 19 contests with a collapsed lung. Dallas cannot be overlooked as it is only three points behind Colorado in the overall standings.3. Washington Capitals (3-0-1; 18-9-3)Like Dallas, the Capitals won three games and lost one after regulation last week. Also like the Stars, Washington lost a key player as defenseman John Carlson missed the team's last three contests with an upper-body injury. The team rolled on without him, however, sandwiching victories against the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets around a shootout loss to the Anaheim Ducks. Rugged forward Tom Wilson continued to produce offensively, recording two goals and an assist last week to give him at least one point in eight of his last nine games and 11 of the past 14. In the crease, Logan Thompson went 1-0-1 as he allowed only four goals on 102 shots and lowered his goals-against average to 1.96, which is second-best in the league behind Minnesota Wild rookie Jesper Wallstedt (1.95). The 28-year-old Thompson turned aside all 39 shots he faced against Columbus on Sunday en route to his seventh career shutout and 100th NHL victory.4. Vegas Golden Knights (3-0-0; 14-6-8)The Golden Knights are riding a four-game winning streak that has followed a four-game skid after defeating the Chicago Blackhawks in a shootout, the Devils in regulation and the Rangers in overtime last week. Jack Eichel scored the winning goal in the extra session of Sunday's triumph at Madison Square Garden, giving him back-to-back two-point performances and points in seven of his last nine contests. Mitch Marner has landed on the scoresheet in five of his last six outings and Tomas Hertl has tallied four times in as many games. Defenseman Shea Theodore recorded a goal and three assists in three contests last week while captain Mark Stone has picked up a point in all 12 of his outings this season after notching four assists.5. Anaheim Ducks (2-1-0; 18-10-1)The Ducks got off to a rough start in Week 9 as they were trounced 7-0 by the Utah Mammoth, but they bounced back with a shootout triumph over Washington and a dominant 7-1 victory against Chicago. Leo Carlsson scored twice in that contest to end a two-game dry spell and give him points in eight of his last 10 games. The 20-year-old Swedish center is tied for seventh in the NHL with 38 points and is seven away from matching his total in 76 contests last season. Meanwhile, Beckett Sennecke has recorded a goal and an assist in each of his last two outings and has been kept off the scoresheet just once in his last 11 games. The 19-year-old right wing, who leads all NHL rookies with 24 points, hasn't gone back-to-back contests without one since a four-game drought from Oct. 23-31. 6. Minnesota Wild (2-2-0; 16-9-5)Minnesota endured a four-game road trip last week and had its 12-game point streak (10-0-2) halted with back-to-back setbacks against the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks. The trek ended on a high note, however, as the Wild topped the Seattle Kraken 4-1 on Monday behind a three-point effort from Joel Eriksson Ek. The 28-year-old Swedish center ended his five-game point drought with a goal and two assists, matching his output over his previous nine contests. Kirill Kaprizov netted his team-leading 18th tally against the Kraken, tying him for third in the league. Wallstedt allowed four goals in the loss at Vancouver but made 33 saves in Edmonton last Tuesday to post his league-high fourth shutout of the season, all of which came during a six-game span.7. Carolina Hurricanes (1-2-0; 17-9-2)The Hurricanes fell three spots in the ratings after losing two of their three games in Week 9. Carolina scored just one goal in both defeats but matched its season high in its 6-3 triumph over the Nashville Predators. Nikolaj Ehlers and Jackson Blake registered three points apiece in the win as nine of the team's 12 forwards got on the scoresheet. The 22-year-old Blake went without a point in his previous six contests. Defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere notched an assist in all three games and has recorded at least one point in 10 of his last 13 outings. 8. Detroit Red Wings (3-0-1; 16-11-3)The Red Wings entered Week 9 with a four-game losing streak (0-3-1) and exited it with three wins and a shootout loss, a setback against the Columbus Blue Jackets last Thursday that kicked off a six-game road trip. Detroit followed that with victories at Seattle and Vancouver, scoring four goals in each. Captain Dylan Larkin netted his team-best 16th tally Monday against the Canucks and has registered at least one point seven of his last eight outings. Meanwhile, Lucas Raymond collected two goals and three assists last week and has landed on the scoresheet in 13 of his past 15 contests. Alex DeBrincat notched a point in all four of Detroit's games, amassing two goals and three assists, while defenseman Moritz Seider netted one tally and set up five others.9. Los Angeles Kings (2-2-0; 14-8-7)Los Angeles began last week with losses to Washington and Chicago, scoring once in each defeat, but erupted for a total of 10 goals in back-to-back triumphs over the Blackhawks and Mammoth. Adrian Kempe finished Week 8 by netting just his third tally in 16 contests but now has three in his last five games after converting against both the Capitals and Utah. The Kings received two-goal performances from a pair of unlikely sources in their wins as defenseman Brandt Clarke increased his goal total for the season to five with a pair against Chicago on Saturday and Joel Armia converted twice against the Mammoth to end his five-game point drought and give him seven tallies in his first campaign with Los Angeles following seven with the Montreal Canadiens.10. New York Islanders (3-1-0; 16-11-3)No, the Islanders aren't making their first appearance in the top 10 this season because of their 6-3 victory over the Avalanche this past Thursday, although I doubt many would complain if that was the reason. The club also posted a pair of triumphs over what had been a red-hot Tampa Bay team, ending the Lightning's seven-game winning streak with a 2-1 triumph last Tuesday, and climbed within four points of division-leading Washington in a tight Metropolitan that has the first and last-place teams separated by only seven points. The Isles had balanced scoring in those three wins as eight players combined for their 10 goals, with Bo Horvat and Casey Cizikas each scoring twice. It was a rare offensive outburst by the 34-year-old Cizikas, who converted in back-to-back games after having tallied just once over his first 27 contests this season. Ilya Sorokin was in net for each of the victories and stopped 97 of the 101 shots he faced. The 30-year-old Russian made 32 saves against Tampa Bay on Saturday for his third shutout of 2025-26 and the 25th of his career.\n            ",

This year, we've added a column for those of you who play in four-point-per-pass TD leagues, and a column for half-PPR leagues! Yes finally.                      The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart.                      By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has two or more players than the other. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).                     \nThis list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.                      Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my updated projected rest of season schedule rankings available on SportsLine later this week.                          \nYou can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at drichard@cbs.com or at @daverichard on X.

Notre Dame was not the only team to forgo its postseason opportunity -- Iowa State and Kansas State also notably passed on their eligibility, among others -- but it is now at the center of the conversation about bowl season's long-term future.With its 10-2 record at No. 11 ranking, Notre Dame would have been a top candidate for the most prestigious non-playoff bowls. But as the CFP continues to diminish the value of bowl games, the Fighting Irish's bracket snub played a key role in their election to call it a season and cast further doubt on the sustainability of the traditional bowl format.\"It was a decision that I applaud,\" Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua said in a Tuesday press conference. \"I think it was a hard decision. I think they knew it was going to be a hard decision. I think they knew it was going to be a decision that not everybody was going to love. But it was the right decision for this team at this moment. I'm positive of that.\"Bevacqua said that in addition to the CFP snub, Notre Dame also weighed the value of allowing its players to focus on final exams and to return home for the holidays in assessing its desire to play in a bowl game. The decision largely rested on the shoulders of the team captains, with whom coach Marcus Freeman consulted in making the decision.\n\"The unanimous message that came back was we are such a close team, those guys in that locker room, that they want to make sure that the last team that took the field as part of the 2025 Notre Dame season was the same team that took the field when we got off the plane in Miami (for the season opener),\" Bevacqua said. \"They didn't feel it was right for this team to make the decision to go out there and not be that full team that has been so close together.\"Notre Dame's move set a precedent that other teams may follow in the years to come. It is already common for players on non-playoff teams to opt out of bowl games and instead begin their pursuit of NFL careers or opportunities through the transfer portal. Now that entire teams have begun to decline postseason berths, Pandora's box may be open for good.\nReaching the playoff will become a touch easier for Notre Dame starting next season. A memorandum of understanding signed by the university states that the Fighting Irish will be assured a playoff berth if it ranks inside the top 12. Had that clause gone into effect in 2025, the No. 11-ranked Fighting Irish would not have had a bowl decision to make in the first place.\n            \n    ",

Fannin finished Week 14 as the TE1 with eight catches for 114 yards and one touchdown. And you know what, he'd been building to something just like this. Fannin has had his moments throughout the year, but he looks truly elite with Shedeur Sanders. In Sanders' three starts, Fannin ranks second amongst all tight ends with a 27.8% target share. His 2.32 yards per route run and 14.9 PPR FPPG both rank fourth amongst tight ends in that stretch. His 17-game pace with Sanders is 85 catches for 1,116 yards and 11 touchdowns. Like I said, elite.Now it has only been three games, so I don't want to make any grand proclamations about Fannin over the rest of the season. I will just say that he is TE3 in the rankings for me this week, and all three of our rankers have him ranked as a top-five tight end. If you already have Trey McBride or George Kittle, you should strongly consider Fannin in the flex, particularly in full PPR. While Fannin is doing what we love to see from rookies, Tyler Warren is headed in the opposite direction. With Daniel Jones out for the year, Warren's recent slump in production is forecast to continue. He's just barely inside my top 12 tight ends this week, even though the Seahawks have been pretty bad against tight ends this year. It is possible Philip Rivers does something miraculous and fixes things, but we aren't holding our breath. If you've picked up Juwan Johnson, Theo Johnson, or Fannin recently, you can start them over Warren in Week 15.Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 15:\n\n        Week 15 TE Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            29.4% -- Kyle Pitts has a 29.4% target share in the four games Drake London has missed. He is a must-start if London is out this week.12.5 -- Isaiah Likely scored 12.5 PPR Fantasy points the last time the Ravens played the Bengals, and he should have had 20. Either he or Mark Andrews is likely to be a good start, maybe both.21.7% -- Theo Johnson has a 21.7% target share with Jaxson Dart on the field this season. He could have a monster game against the Commanders.13.3 -- Since Week 9, Colston Loveland is TE6 with an average of 13.3 PPR FPPG.6.93 -- The Bills are giving up a league-low 6.93 PPR FPPG to tight ends this season. You should probably avoid Hunter Henry.5.5 -- Oronde Gadsden has only averaged 5.5 PPR FPPG since Joe Alt went down.Week 15 Streamers (TE Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

In Week 13, when Dart returned, Johnson tied for the team lead in targets with eight. The rookie loves his tight end and should have success targeting him against the Washington Commanders. Washington has given up the third most PPR Fantasy points to opposing tight ends and just gave up three touchdowns to the Vikings tight ends.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CLE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -7.5\n                                    O/U 39.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                63%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    35\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    49\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    435\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Loveland scored 12.9 PPR Fantasy points in the team's first game without Rome Odunze, the second time in three games he's scored at least that much.

the main slate. The Bears have given up the sixth most receptions to tight ends this season, and Fannin is clearly Shedeur Sanders' favorite target. This should be another game where the Browns play from behind and have to air it out. Don't be surprised if Sanders throws 40 passes and Fannin has another game with double-digit targets.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n

him a bad play this week, at least according to the projections. I am willing to take that type of risk for a contrarian player when I am getting a great player in a great matchup. Seattle has given up the second most points to tight ends this year, and I expect the Colts will be playing from behind. Again, this is only as a contrarian play, but it's a great one.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 15 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

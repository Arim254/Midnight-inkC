    "body": "\n        A potential Super Bowl preview could be unfolding when 8-4 teams meet on 'Monday Night Football' to wrap up the Week 14 NFL schedule as the Philadelphia Eagles visit the Los Angeles Chargers. Philly is coming off back-to-back losses, though it enters this game on extra rest after most recently falling to Chicago, 24-15, on Black Friday. Quarterback Justin Herbert (hand) and running back Omarion Hampton (ankle), who was activated from the IR on Monday, are both active for Los Angeles. Defensive lineman Jalen Carter (both shoulders) and offensive tackle Lane Johnson (foot) are among the key players out for the Eagles. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Philadelphia is the 1.5-point favorite in the latest Chargers vs. Eagles odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 42.5.

L.A. has allowed both the second-fewest rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, in addition to the team ranking third in total defense and fourth in third-down defense. On the other side of the ball, the Chargers are coming off 192 yards on the ground and a season-high of two rushing touchdowns last week, as they'll get to face a Philly defense that ranks in the bottom 10 in both rushing yards allowed and rushing average given up. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Eagles vs. Chargers       picksFor Chargers vs. Eagles  on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 43 combined points.

Aside from Gs Caleb Williams (17 ppg) & Andrew Phillips (14 ppg), firepower is limited; at 69.3 ppg, Lafayette ranks 317th in scoring, and poor 40.7% FG accuracy ranks even lower (33rd out of 361). More to like with Fran McCaffery's Penn, outgunned by Hofstra and Villanova the past two but hardly outmatched here, with a legit go-threat in forward Ethan Roberts (18 ppg) and hitting 41% beyond the arc (ranks 13th nationally).\" Back Penn at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Timberwolves vs. Suns: Over 223.5 points (-115)The Timberwolves have the No. 6 scoring offense in the NBA at 120.3 points per game this season, and they've scored at least 125 points in three of their last four games. Anthony Edwards continues to showcase that he's one of the top playmakers in the league, ranking eighth in the league in scoring at 28.1 ppg this season. He's scored more than 30 points in six of his last eight games to lead Minnesota's offensive outbursts, while Julius Randle is adding 23 ppg this season. Although the Suns will be without their leading scorer in Devin Booker (groin), the Suns still have capable playmakers, including Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen. Brooks (Achilles) is questionable, but he's averaging 27.7 ppg over his last three games.

The Eagles are in the midst of one of their lows, traveling to L.A. on a two-game losing streak, and the Chargers are a tough matchup for a team looking to end a losing skid. The Chargers are 19-10 over the first two years of the Jim Harbaugh era, including 8-4 this year, and they have won four of their last five games. Starting running back Omarian Hampton (ankle) is expected to return on Monday, and although Justin Herbert (hand) is listed as questionable, his history of toughness shows a likelihood of him playing, despite having surgery on his non-throwing hand earlier in the week. The Chargers are also allowing the third-fewest yards per game heading into a matchup against an Eagles offense that hasn't been as impressive this year as last year, largely stemming from Saquon Barkley averaging 61.7 rushing yards per game compared to 125.3 yards per game last year.

    "body": "\n        The Indianapolis Colts' 2025 season is in danger of ending on a sour note, as quarterback Daniel Jones went down with a torn Achilles in Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. With the division and a playoff spot on the line, the 8-5 Colts are considering bringing back the quarterback that started for them the last time Indianapolis made the postseason.According to CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones, the Colts are hosting Philip Rivers for a workout this week to see if he could potentially join their roster. Rivers turned 44 years old on Monday, and was named a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame just last month.If Rivers, who is now a grandfather, were to sign with the Colts, he would join a new-look quarterback room headlined by rookie Riley Leonard and Brett Rypien. Rivers' oldest child, Halle, is a few months older than Leonard. There are four quarterbacks 44 or older to start an NFL game: Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Next Sunday, it will have been 1,800 days, or almost five years, since Rivers last took a snap in an NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research. \nOldest starting quarterbacks in NFL historyAgeTeamSeasonTom Brady45 years, 5 months, 13 daysBuccaneers2022Steve DeBerg44 years, 9 months, 6 daysFalcons1998Vinny Testaverde44 years, 26 daysPanthers2007Warren Moon44 years, 8 daysChiefs 2000Doug Flutie 42 years, 2 months, 10 days Chargers 2004Rivers last played in 2020 for the Colts. He led Indy to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth, while throwing for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the San Diego-turned Los Angeles Chargers. An eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter, and currently ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). How would this impact Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility?For the first time, Rivers is eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was recently among the 26 modern-era candidates who made the cut as semifinalists. Drew Brees and fellow 2004 draftee Eli Manning are the other modern-era quarterbacks who are currently eligible for enshrinement next summer in Canton, Ohio. The Hall of Fame requires a player to be retired for five seasons before he is eligible for induction. Under those rules, Rivers would no longer be eligible for induction this year should be choose to sign with the Colts. If his plays this season, Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility would reset, meaning he wouldn't be eligible for induction until 2031. This offseason, Rivers said on the \"Dan Patrick Show\" that he was receiving interest from teams in 2021 and 2022. The New Orleans Saints even called Rivers and Drew Brees in 2021. \"The reason there was a little bit of a wait is there were a couple of November/Decembers there in 2021 and 2022 where I was staying ready,\" Rivers said. \"I threw on shoulder pads a few times and a helmet and was throwing in the yard and working just in case. And there were a few things that kind of got close. But then the last two years I pretty much knew I was done.\"However, it would appear Rivers is not 100% done. There's still work to be done and hurdles to clear, but there appears to be legitimate mutual interest between Rivers and the Colts. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A cross-conference NFL Week 14 matchup has the Los Angeles Chargers hosting the Philadelphia Eagles on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. A MNF SGP could consist of NFL picks on the money line, and the Chargers have won five of their last six home games versus the Eagles. Philadelphia is a 2.5-point favorite and the over/under is 41.5, per the latest Eagles vs. Chargers odds, with spread and total picks also being popular bets to include in NFL same-game parlays. Many will also go the route of including prop picks, with the likes of Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Keenan Allen and Ladd McConkey top players to target, especially with the questionable tag on Justin Herbert (hand) and Omarion Hampton (ankle).Hurts and Barkley have similar NFL prop odds as an anytime touchdown scorer with Barkley at +105 and Hurts at +110. Neither found the end zone last week, however, while Hampton (+190), who was activated from the IR on Monday, has the shortest odds to score amongst Chargers. Adding a plus-money NFL prop like this could result in a huge payday on your MNF same-game parlay.

Brown goes Under 61.5 receiving yards (-112). With Philly's offensive struggles, Brown is having the worst season of his career as his 63.5 receiving yards per game are the lowest of his seven NFL seasons. While he's found success against poor teams, that hasn't been the case against the league's better squads. Brown hasn't even reached 50 receiving yards in four of his last five versus teams that currently have winning records.The 8-4 Chargers fit the bill, and they will be the best pass defense that the Eagles have seen all year. L.A. ranks second versus the pass as it is built to prevent big days from wide receivers. Only one wideout has had more than 46 receiving yards versus the Chargers over the last four games. Brown is projected to have 52.2 receiving yards on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here, and bet this prop here:How to make Eagles vs. Chargers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has two other NFL props that are rated 4.5 stars or better that could be a part of your Chargers vs. Eagles SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Eagles vs. Chargers predictions?

Brown, Kimani Vidal, Keenan Allen and Omarion Hampton, who has been activated from the IR (ankle) and is expected to play on Monday. Anyone experienced with fielding NFL DFS lineups, however, knows that finding the right balance between highly priced stars and economical options is a must. Thus, perhaps your daily Fantasy football strategy may consider Chargers rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden for MNF DFS lineups?The fifth-round pick has the sixth-most Fantasy points amongst tight ends since Week 6.

Hurts is running more as of late, with 30+ yards rushing in three straight, and his eight scores on the ground rank seventh in the NFL. Hurts' running could be a weapon versus L.A. as just two teams have allowed more rushing TDs to opposing quarterbacks. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also rostering Chargers receiver Ladd McConkey, who has been one of the most productive wideouts after a slow start. Since Week 5, McConkey ranks 11th amongst wide receivers in Fantasy points. Over this stretch of eight games, McConkey has either 56 yards or a touchdown in seven of them, so he supplies a high Fantasy floor. Meanwhile, Philly has allowed three wideouts to have 75+ yards over the last three weeks, with two of them also scoring touchdowns. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set 'Monday Night Football' NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Heisman Trophy finalists were announced on Monday and the list of stars headed to New York features some of the best and brightest from a particularly chaotic football season. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love will all take center stage during Saturday's ceremony, which is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET, but only one will be crowned as the 80th Heisman Trophy winner. It certainly seems like a quarterback will be taking the Heisman Trophy home this year after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter broke the streak of three straight quarterback winners last season. Mendoza and Pavia are the two favorites to win the award now that most votes have been cast following championship game weekend. Though a quarterback winning the Heisman is nothing new, it would still be a historic triumph for either Mendoza or Pavia -- neither Indiana nor Vanderbilt have ever produced a Heisman winner. Neither Sayin nor Love should be entirely discounted. Sayin started at quarterback for the best team in college football -- entering the Big Ten Championship Game, at least -- and Love is one of the most talented running backs to pass through Notre Dame in the modern era.Here's a more detailed look at the four players who made the cut for the 2025 Heisman Trophy. \nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana Mendoza is now the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy after his heroic performance in Indiana's Big Ten Championship Game win against Ohio State. Mendoza helped the Hoosiers capture their first outright conference title in 80 years with 15 completions for 222 yards and one touchdown. He effectively sealed the 13-10 victory with a perfectly placed 33-yard pass to wide receiver Charlie Becker that converted a third-and-6 with just over two minutes to play. Mendoza also orchestrated the crucial 88-yard touchdown drive in which he completed passes of 51 yards and 17 yards for the decisive score. That brought his stats on the year to a respectable 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns through the air. He also rushed for six touchdowns. Mendoza won't win because of the box score, though, but more for his impact in leading a historically deficient program to new heights. Diego Pavia, QB, VanderbiltSpeaking of leading programs that have struggled historically, Pavia is the engine behind Vanderbilt's modern Renaissance under coach Clark Lea. He's emerged as one of the nation's premier playmakers -- akin to Johnny Manziel and the freestyling gunslingers of yore -- and his hot close to the season has him on the precipice of winning college football's most prestigious individual award. He averaged a whopping 455.8 total yards of offense and was responsible for 16 touchdowns in Vanderbilt's last four games. He rushed for 165 yards on 8.3 yards per carry in Vanderbilt's regular season finale against Tennessee, which helped propel the Commodores to their first win against their in-state rival since 2018. Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State Sayin's Heisman outlook seems to have faded in the wake of Ohio State's Big Ten Championship Game loss, though he turned in a solid 258-yard, one-touchdown performance. That also marked the 11th game this season in which he completed at least 70% of his passes. It should come as no surprise that his 78.4% completion rate leads all FBS quarterbacks. As does his 182.1 passer rating among quarterbacks that have thrown the ball at least 100 times this season. Sayin has at least one more year before he's eligible for the NFL Draft, so there's a good chance this won't be the last time he's involved in the Heisman conversation. \nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame Love most likely won't win the Heisman, but he certainly belongs at the ceremony. He's powered Notre Dame's offense all season long as one of the most explosive runners in college football. Love is one of just two running backs at the FBS level with at least 1,000 yards rushing on 6.9 yards per carry. His eight-carry, 171-yard performance in Notre Dame's 70-7 win against Syracuse was one of the best rushing performances all season. It's also rather typical of what Love accomplished with the Fighting Irish.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mike Tomlin had plenty of reasons to blow a kiss to the CBS camera after the Steelers' 27-22 win over the Ravens on Sunday.The win came one week after he heard \"Fire Tomlin\" chants during a 23-6 home loss to the Bills. He spent the week addressing his future, hearing reports and speculation about his future and even hearing his former Super Bowl-winning quarterback suggest, \"Maybe it's time to clean house.\"The win came despite the Steelers being outgained by more than 100 yards.But most importantly, the win took the Steelers from seemingly on the brink to in the driver's seat in the AFC North with four weeks to play. Tomlin has famously -- or infamously -- never had a losing record, and games like this one are why. The Steelers are 7-6, the win having stopped a two-game losing streak.\"Awesome team win,\" Tomlin said. \"I'm just appreciative of the effort of the men in that locker room. It's classic Steelers vs. Ravens. ... [I] appreciate the efforts. Big win for us, obviously, in a hostile environment, and we'll keep moving.\"\nThey certainly will keep it moving; they have no other choice. The Steelers lead the Ravens by one game and, crucially, have the head-to-head tiebreaker. They also know all too well how quickly things can slip the other way. Last year, the Steelers blew a two-game AFC North lead with four weeks to go.As we turn our attention to Week 15, the stage only gets brighter and the road to January, for many teams, officially begins now. Can they avoid a similar fate this year?\n        \n            \n                Ravens lose to Steelers in controversial finish, but have no one to blame but themselves as season nears brink\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCurrent AFC North standings, odds projectionsHere's how the Steelers and Ravens measure up in the AFC North, plus the top two tiebreakers if the teams end up with the same record.\nW-LTiebreaker 1:   Head-to-headTiebreaker 2:   Division W-L      1.

(In this case, the Ravens would clinch the AFC North even before playing the Steelers in Week 18.)Lose to Bengals and one of Patriots/Packers, beat Steelers; Steelers lose two of three other remaining games; Bengals lose at least one more game.Beat Steelers and lose other three games; Steelers lose out; Bengals lose at least two more games.Needless to say, the Ravens are big Dolphins fans this weekend, followed by the Lions in Week 16 and the Browns in Week 17.Can either team claim a wild card bid?The short answer is it's extremely unlikely.

The Chargers are getting healthier here with the return of running back Omarion Hampton, but they'll have to navigate the injury to Justin Herbert. They're looking to keep pace in the AFC wild card race and stay within potential striking distance of the Denver Broncos in the AFC West.Philadelphia has lost back-to-back games to drop its record to 8-4 and looks like it is in a bad way at the moment. The coaching staff and the players are increasingly coming under fire despite the fact that the Eagles look to be in full control of the division and on their way to a playoff spot. There's a lot of angst in Philadelphia right now, and a win in this game would go a long way toward alleviating it.Will the Chargers deal the Eagles their third loss in a row, or will Philadelphia break the streak? We'll find out soon enough. But before we clue you into some key storylines for this matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Eagles vs. ChargersDate: Monday, Dec. 8 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -1.5, O/U 41.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Eagles battle the Chargers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nKey storylinesJustin Herbert's injury. Herbert broke a bone in his hand last week against the Raiders. He briefly left the game and was replaced by Trey Lance, but he later returned wearing a padded glove. He had surgery on the hand last week and was limited in practices throughout the week. It'll be interesting to see how he handles snaps from under center, or whether the Chargers go exclusively shotgun throughout the game to protect his hand. How he handles the Eagles pass rush is also worth monitoring, given that he probably doesn't want to take very many hits and risk injuring the hand any further. Eagles offensive struggles. Philadelphia has not scored more than 21 points since its Week 9 bye. The Eagles have struggled to run the ball and they have struggled to throw the ball with any degree of consistency, and they've also turned the ball over five times in their four post-bye games. The Chargers have an excellent defense that is fresh off holding the Raiders to an anemic 156 total yards and 31 rushing yards, so it could be some tough sledding if the Eagles can't get back to doing the things they used to do well. Nick Sirianni reportedly had a greater hand in the offensive game plan this week, so we'll see how he and OC Kevin Patullo decide to attack L.A.'s defense.Omarion Hampton's return. Hampton has been out since Week 5, when he suffered a fracture in his ankle. He was off to a terrific start to his rookie season before going down, but he's also been out for more than two full months. He's expected to split carries with Kimani Vidal in some form or fashion, but we don't yet know how that split will look. Vidal had some really good games in Hampton's absence, but was also somewhat inconsistent, seemingly going off every other week. Still, he should provide a nice one-two punch with Hampton and keep the latter fresh as he works his way back into the lineup.Playoff picture. The Chargers are currently 8-4 and in sixth place in the AFC. They're a half-game behind the Bills for the No. 5 seed. With a win, they would jump ahead of Buffalo and take over that fifth slot. With a loss, they'd drop to 8-5 and move behind the Colts and Texans, out of the field entirely. Philadelphia is also 8-4 and owns the No. 3 seed in the NFC thanks to its control of the NFC East. The Eagles can't move up or drop down in the NFC standings based on the result of this game, but they could extend their division lead over the Cowboys and keep pace with the 9-3-1 Packers for the No. 2 seed if they come away with a win. Bet Chargers vs. Eagles at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins.Chargers vs. Eagles prediction, pick\nThe Justin Herbert hand surgery has me off the Chargers in this game. Even if they get Omarion Hampton back, I don't know how effective we can expect the offense to be -- even against a defense that has struggled the last two weeks. We know the type of ceiling Vic Fangio's unit can reach. Do I trust the Eagles' offense at all here? Nope. But I'll back the team whose quarterback at least is not injured. \nPick: Eagles 21, Chargers 17 | (Philadelphia -1.5, Under 41.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins has once again entered the concussion protocol following the team's Week 14 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Higgins missed the Bengals' Week 13 victory against the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion, but returned on Sunday. During the matchup in Buffalo, Higgins hit his head hard on the turf twice. He was evaluated for a head injury in both instances but returned to the game. On Monday, Bengals coach Zac Taylor revealed that Higgins was back in the protocol after reporting symptoms Sunday night and Monday morning. \"I'm just told if he's available or not,\" Taylor said. \"So I think what happened yesterday was -- obviously there's some (hits) that looked bad. Tee felt good throughout it, is what I've gained throughout the game and postgame obviously. He did this morning and last night have symptoms again. So we will put him back in the protocol.\"On Monday evening, the NFL and NFLPA released a joint statement detailing exactly what happened with Higgins, via CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones: \n\"Tee Higgins was evaluated twice in game and cleared to return. After the game, in discussion with club medical personnel as part of a postgame evaluation, he notified the team he was experiencing symptoms and was immediately placed in the concussion protocol.\"The joint statement won't do anything to quell concerns regarding the NFL's concussion protocol. It was clear that a player coming off a concussion took two massive shots to the head, showed discomfort/pain, and was allowed to return to action.\nHiggins was a major part of the Bengals' offense on Sunday despite the big hits, as he caught six passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns. He told reporters afterward that he didn't consider sitting out after hitting his head multiple times. \"I'm a team-first guy,\" Higgins said. \"My team needed me, you know I feel like they did, so I went out there and played and tried to dog this out with my team.\"\nWith Higgins again in the concussion protocol, it's fair to say his status for Sunday's matchup against the Ravens is in doubt. According to SportsLine, the Bengals have a 3.1% chance to win the AFC North. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the final College Football Playoff rankings were announced, Notre Dame saw its postseason hopes dissolve. Alabama remained at No. 9 after getting blasted in the SEC Championship. Despite both teams being idle, Miami jumped the Irish for the No. 10 spot after weeks of being ranked behind them. It was both shocking and somewhat predictable, as there was never going to be an acceptable outcome given the way the committee handled this situation all year. Notre Dame felt bamboozled by a number of parties; the committee; the CFP's TV partner, ESPN; and the ACC. As a result, Notre Dame declined all bowl bids, a move some believe was a bit of a parting shot at ESPN, which broadcasts and operates most bowl games. Pete Bevacqua, the school's athletic director, has been making the rounds to voice Notre Dame's displeasure with the situation. He joined the Dan Patrick Show Monday where he addressed the ACC's role in the situation.\"We have no gripes about any of the schools in the ACC. But we were mystified by the actions of the conference to attack their biggest business partner in football and a member of their conference in 24 of our other sports,\" Bevacqua said. \"And I wouldn't be honest with you if I didn't say that they've certainly done permanent damage between the conference and Notre Dame.\"\n\"Just we didn't appreciate the fact that we were singled out repeatedly and compared to Miami,\" Bevacqua explained when asked to elaborate. \"Not by Miami -- Miami has every right to do that -- but it raised a lot of eyebrows here that the conference was taking shots at us.\" The relationship between Notre Dame and the ACC certainly complicated matters here, but when push came to shove, there was never a world where the ACC wouldn't back one of their actual member programs in favor of a \"business partner,\" as Bevacqua put it.ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said as much in a statement on Monday.\"The University of Notre Dame is an incredibly valued member of the ACC and there is tremendous respect and appreciation for the entire institution,\" Phillips said. \"With that said, when it comes to football, we have a responsibility to support and advocate for all 17 of our football-playing member institutions, and I stand behind our conference efforts to do just that leading up to the College Football Playoff Committee selections on Sunday.\n\"At no time was it suggested by the ACC that Notre Dame was not a worthy candidate for inclusion in the field. We are thrilled for the University of Miami while also understanding and appreciating the significant disappointment of the Notre Dame players, coaches and program.\"Notre Dame is an ACC member in most other sports. In football, they have a deal to play five games per season against ACC teams while retaining their beloved independency. They recently added a long-term scheduling agreement with Clemson to play each year from 2027-38 that raised some questions among other ACC programs about how that will impact the Irish's agreement, and it seems there is some serious tension building within their partnership. As for what the ramifications are for the \"permanent damage\" Bevacqua claims has been done by the ACC stumping for the Canes, that's not abundantly clear. Perhaps the Irish will look to solidify more scheduling deals with the ACC's biggest programs, frustrating others who could lose home games with Notre Dame that would be huge revenue drivers. \nThe biggest problem Notre Dame should have with the ACC is that they could have avoided this debacle with a better tiebreaker policy to put the highest ranked teams in the ACC title game. Miami winning the ACC would have kept Notre Dame in the field as the final at-large team, but instead the Canes watched as their old friend Manny Diaz and Duke win an ACC title before them. All of this will become a moot issue next year when Notre Dame's MOU with the Playoff kicks in and they're guaranteed a spot if they rank inside the top 12. That doesn't help the Irish this year, and in the meantime they're searching for anyone to blame other than themselves for losing their first two games against their two best opponents. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chiefs offensive lineman Wanya Morris is out for the season due to a knee injury he suffered on Kansas City's opening play of their Week 14 \"Sunday Night Football\" loss to the Texans, ESPN is reporting. The broadcast declined to show replays, but social media clips showed Morris' left knee hyperextending at a gruesome angle.Morris was only starting because normal starting left tackle Josh Simmons is on IR after undergoing surgery to repair his dislocated and fractured left wrist suffered in Kansas City's Thanksgiving Day loss to the Cowboys. Esa Pole, an undrafted rookie out of Washington State who was only called up to the active roster after Simmons' injury, came in to take Morris' place in the eventual 20-10 loss.Chiefs offensive line injuries continueIt's yet another devastating loss up front for Kansas City, which is also without Pro Bowl right guard Trey Smith and right tackle Jawaan Taylor.Chiefs offensive lineWeek 1 vs. ChargersEnd of Week 14 vs. TexansLeft tackleJosh SimmonsEsa PoleLeft guardKingsley SuamataiaKingsley SuamataiaCenterCreed HumphreyCreed HumphreyRight guardTrey SmithMike CaliendoRight tackleJawaan TaylorJaylon MooreOverall, the Chiefs have used 17 different offensive line combinations this season. The most-used group -- the Week 1 starters -- has played 379 offensive snaps together, 14th-most of all offensive line combinations, but that group has played in just two games since Week 6.Simmons, the 32nd overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, was away from the team from Weeks 6-10 for personal reasons. Smith (ankle) got hurt in a Week 12 win over the Colts, and Taylor (triceps/ankle), like Simmons, got hurt in Week 13 against the Cowboys.What's next for Chiefs?Both Smith and Taylor were listed as doubtful ahead of the Texans game before being ruled out. Neither have been placed on injured reserve, a potentially good sign, but Simmons will miss at least another three weeks due to his placement on IR.Should Taylor be able to return soon, Kansas City could try to flip Moore back to left tackle, which is where he played during Simmons' first absence.It's been a trying season for Kansas City (6-7) for several reasons, including the rotating offensive line groups. Sunday, Patrick Mahomes threw three interceptions and took two sacks. It was Mahomes' fourth career three-interception game, and his first with three interceptions and no passing touchdowns.The Chiefs currently occupy the No. 10 seed in the AFC standings and are two games behind No. 7 Houston, who are in the final playoff spot, and No. 8 Indianapolis. The Chiefs have the head-to-head edge over the Colts but do not over the Texans.Kansas City's road doesn't get much easier, either. The Chiefs host the Chargers, whom they lost to in Week 1, in Week 15. They finish the season with the Titans, Broncos and Raiders.SportsLine currently gives Kansas City a 9% chance to make the playoffs; it has not missed the playoffs since 2014.\n            ",

Pulisic, who came off the bench in the second half, scored the deciding two goals of the game, the first one arrived one minute after he entered the pitch, in his first touch of the match. The American captain did not travel with the team on Sunday due to a flu, and only joined the squad on Monday, just a few hours before kickoff at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin.\nTwo key goals against Torino after the home side scored the opening two goals with Nikola Vlasic and Duvan Zapata before a stunning goal from outside the box scored by Adrien Rabiot before halftime. Pulisic came off from the bench at the 66th minute of the game and scored his first goal one minute after entering the pitch, and ten minutes later scored his 9th goal of the season. It was another great night for Pulisic, who is now aiming to secure his first Serie A title with AC Milan. Massimiliano Allegri's side sit at the top of the table alongside Napoli, holding a one-point lead over Inter.\n            \n    ",

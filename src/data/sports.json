    "body": "\nThe last chance to make 'Monday Night Football' DFS picks in the regular season comes in Week 17 as the Rams visit the Falcons at 8:15 p.m. ET. Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite, while the over/under is 49.5. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Bijan Robinson are the first names many will gravitate to when scouring the NFL DFS player pool, but both teams have potential daily Fantasy sleepers. Xavier Smith and Konata Mumpfield have absorbed most of Davante Adams' (doubtful, hamstring) snaps, while Tyler Allgeier is coming off a season-high of 79 rushing yards. None of these underrated options would do too much damage to your NFL DFS salary cap.Additionally, just three teams have allowed more Fantasy points to kickers than the Falcons, which should put Rams kciker Harrison Mevis on your radar. Should you insert him into NFL DFS lineups instead of the likes of Blake Corum or Darnell Mooney? Before making any Rams vs. Falcons DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Bijan Robinson as anytime TD scorer (-130) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Rams vs. FalconsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Rams wideout Puka Nacua, who has an over/under of 106.5 receiving yards. The league leader in receptions (114) is coming off the best game of his career last Thursday when he set or matched career highs in both yards (225) and touchdowns (2). Nacua has at least 167 receiving yards in three straight games, with four scores over that span. He has a great chance of hitting pay dirt versus an Atlanta defense which has seen five of its last six passing TDs allowed end up in the hands of opposing wide receivers. See who else to roster at SportsLine.You can also bet on Nacua to go Over 106.5 receiving yards (-113) at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also rostering Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins. The veteran has accounted for three total touchdowns in back-to-back games. Improved offensive line protection for Atlanta is allowing the team to see the best of Cousins, and he gets to face a suddenly leaky Rams defense. The last four QBs it has faced have averaged 271.5 passing yards and 2.5 passing touchdowns, with the likes of Jacoby Brissett and Bryce Young included in that quartet. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.Bet Cousins to go Over 1.5 touchdown passes (+147) at DraftKings:\nHow to set Falcons vs. Rams NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        Former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua is in \"stable\" condition after suffering minor injuries in a car crash in Nigeria on Monday that killed two other passengers, according to multiple reports. Nigerian president Bola Ahmed Tinubu posted to social media that he spoke with Joshua and Joshua's mother to offer his condolences on the fatal crash that claimed the lives of two of Joshua's associates. \"I have spoken with AJ to personally convey my condolences over the passing of his two close associates, Kevin Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami in the recent accident,\" Tunubu posted. \"I wished him a full and speedy recovery, and prayed with him. AJ assured me he is receiving the best possible care.\"The incident occurred around 11 a.m. local time near Sagamu, according to local officials. Circumstances of the accident are under investigation. \n\"The vehicle conveying Anthony Joshua, a Lexus SUV, was involved in the accident under circumstances that are currently being investigated,\" local police said in a statement. \"He was seated in the rear of the vehicle, sustained minor injuries and receiving medical attention.  Tragically, two other passengers in the vehicle lost their lives at the scene.\"Preliminary investigations indicated the SUV carrying Joshua was \"traveling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit on the corridor, lost control during an overtaking maneuver and crashed into a stationary truck,\" according to the Federal Road Safety Corps. Gbenga Omotoso, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, posted a photo of the accident on social media that showed Joshua standing outside the crash site and said ambulances had been called. The police chief of the local precinct told the Associated Press that Joshua was taken to a local hospital to be \"treated for his injuries.\"\nJoshua had returned to Nigeria, the homeland of his parents, after breaking the jaw of Jake Paul in his knockout victory of the YouTuber-turned-boxer just over a week ago. Paul posted a statement on social media up on learning of Joshua's involvement in the crash stating, \"Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today's unfortunate accident.\"Joshua was targeting a quick return to the ring following his victory over Paul, with promoter Eddie Hearn pointing to a possible bout with kickboxer Rico Verhoeven in late February or early March while they awaited a showdown with fellow former British heavyweight champion Tyson Fury later in 2026. That timeline for a return to the ring is now in question and will depend on the injuries he sustained and how long it will take for him to fully heal. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the No. 1 recruit in the country in the class of 2024, Jeremiah Smith could have chosen to attend any college, including his hometown school, Miami. Smith ultimately ended up signing with Ohio State and now the story of his recruitment will come full circle as the Buckeyes square off with the Hurricanes in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals on Wednesday night. In fact, had Miami been in games of this magnitude two years ago when Smith was being recruited, he said Monday that he \"most likely\" would have been suiting up for the Hurricanes. \"Most likely, yeah. I probably would have ended up going to Miami if things were on the right track, then and there,\" Smith said. \"But I chose to stick with Ohio State.\" \nSmith's comments will likely add more fuel to Miami's proverbial fire entering the highly anticipated matchup in the Cotton Bowl. The Hurricanes, after all, are facing an Ohio State program that sunk their hopes of a dynasty over 20 years ago in one of the biggest upsets in college football history, a loss that changed the trajectory of Miami football. \nFrom 2003-23, the Hurricanes had just two seasons with at least 10 wins. But Miami has enjoyed a recent resurgence under coach Mario Cristobal. Last year (his third season on the job), Cristobal led Miami to its first 10-win season since 2016 but a late-season loss cost the Hurricanes a trip to the CFP. This season, the Hurricanes went 10-2 in the regular season and knocked off Texas A&M in the first round of the playoff to set up the showdown with the Buckeyes, the defending national champions. \n        \n            \n                Ohio State vs. Miami prediction, pick, spread, odds: Buckeyes, Hurricanes meet in Cotton Bowl CFP quarterfinal\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs a freshman, Smith played a key role in Ohio State becoming the first team to win the national title in the 12-team playoff era. Smith was a unanimous All-American, was the Rose Bowl Offensive MVP after catching seven passes for 187 yards and two scores in Ohio State's 41-21 win over Oregon and then he caught five passes for 88 yards and a score in the Buckeyes' 34-23 win over Notre Dame in the CFP National Championship. Smith, 20, has been just as good this season. He led the Big Ten with 80 receptions for 1,086 yards and 11 touchdowns. Smith caught a touchdown pass during Ohio State's 27-9 win over Michigan and had eight receptions for 144 yards during the Buckeyes' 13-10 loss to Indiana in the Big Ten Championship. \nOn Thursday night, Smith will try to help the Buckeyes get one step closer toward their goal of another national title while Miami fans are left to wonder what could have been had the star wide receiver decided to suit up for his hometown team.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Even though the Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1) were eliminated from postseason contention when they took the field on Christmas Day,",
    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Even though the Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1) were eliminated from postseason contention when they took the field on Christmas Day, it was somewhat understandable as to why they would play 32-year-old, four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Dak Prescott.Dallas was running the first leg of three standalone NFL games on a holiday in which most of the country was sitting at home. The Cowboys were also playing on a short week on Thursday, which wouldn't provide many opportunities to get backup Joe Milton ready to roll after playing just 24 offensive snaps this season.However, first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer plans to start Prescott, who suffered a season-ending hamstring injury midway through 2024, in Week 18 against the 3-13 New York Giants. Why? He would like for the Cowboys to finish 8-8-1 and avoid having a losing record. \"Yeah, plan on finishing strong and having Dak play, again get a chance to go 5-1 hopefully in the division, finish 8-8-1 and that's the plan as we're looking at now,\" Schottenheimer said Monday. \nIt's worth Schottenheimer reconsidering since Dallas surrendered a season-high six sacks in a 30-23 win against the Washington Commanders in Week 17 while playing Pro Bowl left guard Tyler Smith out of position at left tackle with Tyler Guyton (ankle) on injured reserve. Undrafted guard T.J. Bass has slid into the starting lineup at left guard with Smith at left tackle. Smith's four quarterback pressures allowed were tied for his third-most in a game in his four-year career, per TruMedia, while Bass' one pressure was tied for the fourth-most in a game in his three-year career. \"I didn't think we did a good enough job protecting Dak last game. It wasn't just those two guys. I thought we ran the ball really, really well. I thought the communication between those guys was really, really good. But I do think that our fundamentals got a little sloppy in a couple of areas,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I'll talk about Tyler for a second. Just to nonchalantly move out to left tackle in this league to me is just crazy. But he does it, and he does it with a smile. He just goes out there and competes. T.J. Bass, he's played so much meaningful football for us, really over the last couple of years. I think he's a very, very talented young player, his star is on the rise. I really like what T.J. does for us.\"Even if Prescott starts, Schottenheimer didn't rule out also rotating in his strong-armed, second-year backup in Milton, someone whose arm talent the coach is \"mesmerized\" by. \n\"We'll look at that. The biggest thing for me is to put the game plan together and hopefully have another great week of practice and focus on getting our prep,\" Schottenheimer said. \"You know how much respect I have for this team, this defense we're getting ready to play, an elite front seven. But yeah, we'll see how the week goes. But right now the plan is to play Dak.\"In his first season, Schottenheimer is aiming to establish a culture where every game is viewed by his players as a \"championship opportunity\" even if that isn't the case like it has been for Dallas since Week 16. In the world the Cowboys live in, Week 18 means something. That's why the current plan is to start Prescott, injury risk be damned. \"I think they all mean something that's what I would say, I think they all do mean something. I think we're all being evaluated on the whole season here,\" Schottenheimer said. \"We're proud of the fact we've played well against the NFC East opponents and get a chance to play another one this weekend but yeah, I feel good about it. ... I am a guy that is all about process. I'm going to be the same guy every day and every week. This week is no different. These guys put a lot of time and energy preparing for 17 games.

You can watch the announcement live in the video at the top of this page, on the CBS Sports App or via your connected device (Roku, Amazon Fire, Apple TV). Jacobs, who ranks as the top prospect in the Class of 2027, will choose from a long list of suitors that includes some of the top programs in the nation. Jacobs, a product of Roswell, Georgia's Blessed Trinity Catholic High School, is one of just nine players to receive a five-star ranking at this point in the recruiting cycle. Though he has yet to release an official list of finalists, recent visits point to the programs that Jacobs is seriously considering. He's been on campus at Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Ohio State and Texas since the start of November. He also took two unofficial visits to Miami during the season, more than any of the other schools that are pursuing him. The Hurricanes have emerged as a legitimate frontrunner for Jacobs over the past few months. \nGeorgia brings obvious in-state appeal, but the Bulldogs also have a couple of key connections that can be pointed to in the final hours before Jacobs' decision. Jacobs is a double legacy at Georgia, where his father, David, played defensive line and his mother, Desiree, played basketball. Former Georgia coach Mark Richt is also DJ's godfather. Whoever lands Jacobs will be getting a defender that could make an instant impact with immense NFL potential. \n\"Cast-iron edge defender with the size, speed and strength to wreak havoc on Saturdays and then Sundays.\" 247Sports Director of Scouting Andrew Ivins wrote in his evaluation of Jacobs. \"Projects as a future difference-maker for a College Football Playoff contender that can set the edge and get after the quarterback.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the festivities are basically done, it's time to drown our sorrows in some fantasy basketball. This week, we have a jam-packed schedule, with 20 teams playing four times, and the remaining 10 teams suiting up on three occasions. With no two-game teams, picking and choosing your roster is going to be an arduous task.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: ATL, BKN, CHA, CHI, CLE, DEN, GSW, IND, MIA, MIL, MIN, NOP, NYK, OKC, ORL, PHO, POR, SAC, SAS, WASThree Games: BOS, DAL, DET, HOU, LAC, LAL, MEM, PHI, TOR, UTATwo Games: N/AHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the eleventh week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Collin Sexton, CHAOpponents: MIL, GSW, @MIL, @CHISexton's success this season has typically come when other players are out. Based on that fact alone, this week might be a good opportunity to move him into your starting lineup. Kon Knueppel is currently sidelined with an ankle injury, something that could end up costing him multiple games. Although Sexton's overall fantasy value is largely reliant on points and 3s, he does have the ability to rack up decent assist numbers when afforded meaningful playing time. Given that he may have been dropped in a lot of leagues, quietly slotting him into your lineup for the next seven days, while somewhat risky, could end up being a smart play.Consider sitting: Jaylen Wells, MEMOpponents: PHI, @LAL, @LALDespite continuing to start, Wells' production over the past two weeks has been highly disappointing. In seven games during that time, he has averaged just 12.3 points, two steals, and 1.4 3-pointers. While there is no indication his role is going to change any time soon, the volume simply hasn't been there of late. As a player outside the top 150 in standard leagues, Wells is definitely a bench candidate this week, especially with so many other teams playing four games.Consider sitting: Ryan Nembhard, DALOpponents: @POR, PHI, HOUAnother player who seemingly has a starting role locked down, Nembhard has cooled off significantly after what was an impressive run of early games. In seven games over the past two weeks, the rookie has been well outside the top 250 in standard leagues, averaging 7.9 points and 6.1 assists in 25.3 minutes per contest. He remains a viable asset, but only for those in need of assists. However, with only three games in the next seven days, there is a decent chance you can supplement his production with someone suiting up four times.\nForwardsConsider starting: Peyton Watson, DENOpponents: @MIA, @TOR, @CLE, @BKNWhile Watson has been somewhat of an unexpected surprise this season, it does appear as though his window of value could be coming to an end in the near future. Denver is currently without three regular starters, meaning Watson's role is safe, for now. Both Christian Braun and Aaron Gordon could return at some point this week, albeit in a limited role. This means we might be able to squeeze one more week of value from Watson, a player who has averaged 12 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 1.3 3-pointers in four games over the past week. Consider starting: Jaylon Tyson, CLEOpponents: @SAS, PHO, DEN, DETDespite recently moving back to the bench, Tyson has been able to continue putting up solid production, averaging 19 points, nine rebounds, 1.7 3-pointers, and 1.3 combined steals and blocks over his past three games. Even though the Cavaliers are starting to get healthy, Tyson should remain a key piece in the rotation, even off the bench. Cleveland is looking to turn around what has been a slow start to the season, with Tyson likely to play a meaningful role. While there is a small amount of risk given the small sample size, managers should feel relatively comfortable rolling him out for a four-game week.Consider sitting: Ausar Thompson, DETOpponents: @LAL, MIA, @CLEThompson's role continues to be a source of frustration for managers, with head coach JB Bickerstaff not afraid to mix things up on a nightly basis. Whether we agree with his decision-making or not, the fact is that Bickerstaff appears to have some trust issues when it comes to Thompson, limiting his overall upside. He is by no means a clear-cut bench candidate, especially for those simply looking for defensive contributions. However, in six appearances over the past two weeks, Thompson has averaged just 12.3 points, six rebounds, and 1.3 steals, including a woeful 51.9 percent from the line.\nCentersConsider starting: Maxime Raynaud, SACOpponents: @LAC, BOS, @PHO, MILWith Domantas Sabonis still weeks away from returning from a knee injury, Raynaud's value continues to go up by the day. While he clearly has some things to work on, his touch around the basket is undeniable. In five games over the past two weeks, the rookie has been a borderline top 60 player, averaging 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 0.8 blocks, shooting 52.9 percent from the field and 84.6 percent from the line. His minutes have been a little underwhelming, having logged no more than 27 minutes in each of the past two games. With that said, he has very little competition at the moment, making him a safe addition to any weekly lineup.Consider sitting: Daniel Gafford, DALOpponents: @POR, PHI, HOUAnthony Davis is sidelined yet again, this time with a groin injury, meaning Gafford should be able to serve as the primary center, at least for the short term. On paper, this appears to be a straightforward decision for managers, especially given Gafford's proven ability to put up numbers in limited minutes. However, Gafford has been dealing with injuries of his own, specifically an ankle injury that has already cost him multiple games. He does appear to be healthy right now, perhaps putting managers' minds at ease for the time being. If you simply need rebounds and blocks, Gafford is worth considering, especially if we get some clarity regarding Davis' absence.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        How's this for a midseason plot twist: We're about to flip the calendar to January and suddenly unranked Baylor has become the Black Hat of college basketball. Before I explain why BU coach Scott Drew is catching heat, here's the need-to-know background on how college basketball has reached a new level of the bizarre in an increasingly volatile roster-building environment. On the morning of Christmas Eve, the NCAA sent word to Baylor's compliance staff that 7-foot Nigerian-born center James Nnaji had been cleared for competition. The controversial decision was groundbreaking in men's college hoops. Nnaji is the first person to reverse course and play college basketball after being selected in the NBA Draft. And it's not like this guy was just off the board last June. Nnaji was the No. 31 overall pick in 2023. He played for the Charlotte Hornets in NBA Summer League that year.  Crucially, Nnaji has never played in an NBA game, which is purportedly still a key distinction for a player's college eligibility. (Though we should brace for that rule to be tested in 2026, I'm sure.) Still, the guy guarded Victor Wembanyama in Summer League and was even part of the big trade that shipped Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks in exchange for Julius Randle to the Minnesota Timberwolves in October 2024.  \nWhile the Knicks still own Nnaji's draft rights per the terms of the Towns/Randle trade, Nnaji is not signed to an NBA contract. More crucial context: Nnaji was never paid outside of his Summer League and travel per diems during his brief time in the NBA pipeline. For the majority of the past five years, he's been playing EuroLeague basketball. That being the case, he had a path to pursue college eligibility, since he never played college ball prior to 2023. (Nnaji was in the FC Barcelona program in the years before he was drafted.) Because Nnaji never enrolled in college here in the States, and because he's within a five-year window of what equates to his high school graduation, his five-year NCAA eligibility clock starts now. Yes, it's crazy, but worth emphasizing that although Baylor is on the receiving end of a lot of outcry over the state of college basketball, Drew's program is far from the only one doing this. The rules keep changing because the threat of legal action is prompting one fold after another. \nBYU (Abdullah Ahmed), Dayton (Sean Pouedet), Washington (Nikola Dzepina) and others have also brought aboard in-season roster additions from other professional ranks. The only difference between all of them and Nnaji is that he was promising enough more than two years ago to have an NBA team select him in the draft. Even within the Big 12, Kansas State's women's team rosters Nastja Claessens, who is second on the Wildcats in scoring at 10.6 points per game. Did you know Claessens, who hails from Belgium, was the 30th pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft? In hockey, Colorado College just added the son of a notable NHL player and someone who's already skated with pros for years. \nDrew did what many — but certainly not all — coaches in his position would do in a period of need. At Oklahoma, Porter Moser just welcomed a 6-11 Russian center named Kirill Elatontsev. It was overshadowed because of the Baylor news, but the newest Sooner arrived on Christmas. Moser told me he's probably going to play him immediately. The past two seasons, the Sooners lost their starting centers to injury down the stretch. Now Elatontsev is an insurance policy. His reasons were the same as Drew's.\"I've never taken a mid-year transfer that can play right away, it's never been part of the game, but if the NCAA clears it and say it's OK, you have to look at it and see if it's good for your situation,\" Moser told CBS Sports. \"In my situation, I have two 5s on the roster and one is currently hurt. We did it for depth. And if he helps us win one game, it was worth it. Back-to-back years we have lost our starting 5s down the stretch and no one was pulling out a violin to talk about our lack of depth.\" But because Baylor made a roster addition with a guy who was an NBA pick, unlike all the others, it's not sitting well with plenty of college sports fans who look around and see the fundamental nature of the sport changing to a level that is unrecognizable from what college basketball was for decades.  \n Drew tells CBS Sports why he pursued former NBA pick Fifty-five years old and in his 23rd season with the Bears, Scott Drew isn't trying to be a villain or the poster coach for renegade roster building. He's merely doing what many, many other coaches have been doing — and all within the rules. You can love it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but Baylor hasn't done anything wrong here. Nnaji went through the vetting process at the NCAA level. He is allowed to play under the current (fluctuating) structure of college basketball.  Drew is aware that he and his program will nevertheless be viewed in a negative light by some. He told me his guiding principle was to do what was best for Baylor.  \"We (coaches) don't create the rules, and if we agree by them or not, I equate it to the speed limit,\" Drew told CBS Sports. \"You go through a construction zone, it changes. You get on the highway, it changes. Right now, the NCAA has speed limits, and it changes. I don't blame the NCAA because a lot of it's about what they feel they can win in the courtroom. To me, until we get to collective bargaining, there's not going to be a solution. Until that time, my job is the coach of our program and we needed to add a player at semester break because we've had two season-ending injuries to two of our biggest players and had a third player out. If you're coaching a team, aren't you going to add the best player you can add that fits your program? That's what we did.\"  \nHigh Point transfer Juslin Bodo Bodo was expected to be the Bears' starting center, but he's been injured since the summer and won't play this season. The same goes for another frontcourt player, Maikcol Perez. Keep in mind, the Big 12 is probably the best league in the country in 2025-26 — and definitely the strongest at the top. Drew has endured a couple of seasons with major roster issues due to injuries, and with a potential stopgap, he and BU general manager Jason Smith pursued Nnaji's eligibility case dating back to early October. The connection came about because Smith has a working relationship with Nnaji's agent, who also represents former Baylor lottery pick Jeremy Sochan. \"For the good of the game, I think most coaches are about 99.9% aligned on things we would have done to change things,\" Drew said. \"The NCAA, athletic directors would feel the same way, but until we have collective bargaining, it's not going to happen. If it's solution-based, how long have we been talking about congressional help? That's not looking like it's going to happen.\"Michigan State's Tom Izzo had some pointed words about the situation a few days ago, though he hadn't spoken to Drew when he was asked about Baylor/Nnaji in a media scrum after a Michigan State practice. Izzo and Drew spoke over the weekend, Drew said. \n\n        \n            \n                Tom Izzo rips Baylor's NBA Draft pick loophole signing of James Nnaji: 'Shame on NCAA, shame on the coaches'\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Me and Izzo are friends, I respect him and it was a great conversation,\" Drew said. \"At the end of the day, both of us agree on things we'd like to see done with rules for the future. When he first came out and talked about G League guys getting to play, I was against it too, but it's a lot like NIL and the portal. You can agree or not agree, but you have a job to do. We can wait on congressional action or we can get to the inevitable of collective bargaining.\"  Drew doesn't expect anything from Congress in the months/years to come. He's open to having a hard-line stance on who is and isn't allowed to enroll to play college basketball, but until there's clarity, can you blame him?  \"If you say you can have a shot in basketball worth 5 points, who's not going to take it?\" he said. \nPros pivoting to college hoops a likely growing trendDrew won't be the last coach to do this, that's for sure. He's just the latest, and the issue could exacerbate in the weeks ahead. Consider the case of former Louisville commit/top-40 high school prospect Trentyn Flowers. Like Nnaji, he never played in college. But unlike Nnaji, Flowers logged real NBA minutes earlier this month for the Chicago Bulls. And in recent days, his agent has been exploring avenues to maybe try and jump down to the college ranks. Flowers is currently in the NBA's G League, but has a two-way contract. And although an initial report about the number of schools \"interested\" in Flowers went viral on Sunday was inaccurate, there are a few kicking the tires. \"Doing our due diligence in the new world, don't have a choice,\" one power-conference assistant told CBS Sports about the possibility of recruiting Flowers. \"At this point it's a little bit of both: agent reaching out but schools finding out and reaching out. More two-way street than some think.\" Now we wait for the next stage of this story: The moment Nnaji will step on the floor for Baylor. Drew told me he has to pass a physical before any further steps are taken, but clearance is expected Tuesday. Baylor's Big 12 opener is Saturday at TCU. Will Nnaji see the floor then? \n\"Definitely could,\" Drew said. \"But until he knows our offense, knows our defense, it doesn't matter how good anyone is, you can't put him out there [for too long]. I think it's going to be a gradual process. If he was ready for the NBA, he would be playing in the NBA.\"  Don't expect Nnaji to be logging north of 25 minutes for the Bears in the weeks to come. But later in the season? We'll see. After all, he was good enough to be drafted No. 31. It's not such a reach to think he might be the key to getting Baylor to a sixth consecutive NCAA Tournament. In-season free agency is now officially a thing in college basketball, and it might be here to stay.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) will be a part of that effort remains up in the air as Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters Monday that the team will have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice.\"It's to be determined,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.\"Jackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson. \nFurthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.\"A+,\" Harbaugh said after the game. \"A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.\"\nHarbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome back to the NBA Hater Report: A breakdown of some of the players, teams and trends around the league that are drawing the ire of yours truly. If you're not a fellow pessimist, proceed with caution. A couple weeks ago, North Carolina State coach Will Wade went on an epic postgame rant. The gist was this: Casual players are the death of a basketball team. It reminded me of the two summers I spent at Steve Lavin's basketball camp when I was a kid. Lavin called it \"wearing your cool jacket\" when a guy was going half speed, and he would call that kid out in front of the camp. It happened to me twice. I liked to shoot deep 3-pointers and dribble between my legs without going anywhere. I did not like to play defense. Casual players, cool jackets, it's all the same thing. These are the guys who don't box out, who don't pay attention away from the play, who can generally only be bothered to defend when their man has the ball, and even then the slap-the-floor stance is mostly for show and rarely holds up beyond the first move. \nLeBron James is becoming a casual player and it's killing the Lakers. Now, before we go any farther in sullying the King's good name, let's first make it clear that LeBron is not the Lakers' only, or even most, casual player. That distinction belongs to Luka Doncic, the president of all casuals. Look at Dončić loafing around in the paint on the possession below. He looks like he's having a confused senior moment searching for his keys, spinning aimless circles in the living room as his man, Jabari Smith Jr., stands unoccupied behind the 3-point line. The face-saving contest at the last second is the exact kind of \"look at me, I'm playing defense!\" move upon which the casual-player club was built. It's not just Dončić. Look at Rui Hachimura standing jelly-legged in no-man's land, rubbernecking the action below him (which he is in no position to affect anyway) with his back to his man, Kevin Durant, who happily accepts the invite to cut straight down the red carpet him like a prisoner scurrying past a half-asleep guard. \nHachimura was just following the casual lead of Austin Reaves, who let this happen less than two minutes into L.A.'s Christmas massacre at the hands of the Rockets.These types of plays are the makings of a Lakers defense that is operating as a bottom-five unit. Some of it is out of their hands. I once had a scout tell me that lateral force, meaning the ability to move side to side as a defender with enough explosion to stay in front of today's super athletes, is the most un-teachable skill he looks for in a prospect. A player, for the most part, either has it or he doesn't. Luka, to say the least, doesn't have it. As a whole, the Lakers are an old, slow, athletically compromised team that is going to struggle to defend even at max effort and focus for the full duration of possessions and, ultimately, games. That's what makes LeBron playing at his full defensive speed and with consistent attention to the dirty-work details, on this particular team, so important. \nEven at (almost) 41 years old and in his 23rd NBA season, James remains the Lakers' most forceful athlete (unless you count Jarred Vanderbilt on the defensive end, but he's an offensive liability). Call that an indictment of Rob Pelinka's roster or an endorsement of LeBron's still-standing physicality at this stage of his career, but either way it is what it is. The Lakers are set offensively with Luka and Reaves (when he gets back from this most recent calf strain). If they really want to compete with the big boys, they badly need LeBron to spend more, if not the bulk, of his energy if not covering for guys on the defensive end the way he has spent the rest of his career doing so on the offensive end, then at least carrying his own weight. They cannot afford for their most physical, athletic defender to be just another casual. Unfortunately, that's exactly what LeBron has been this season. Maybe it's age. Maybe he's just not wired to defend and rebound with consistent and committed force when he's no longer getting the same kind of offensive dopamine hits. Maybe Luka is contagious. Nico Harrison certainly thinks so. \nWhatever the case, here's spectator LeBron drying his hands on his jersey as his man, Amen Thompson, crashes from the corner for a long offensive rebound that leads to a second-chance 3-pointer. Here he is again just standing around doing nothing, not in position to help or get back to his man, who happens to be 42% 3-point shooter Royce O'Neal. Here he is getting cooked by Dillon Brooks -- either because he's not willing to stay strong against multiple moves or because he's no longer capable. \nHere he is flapping his chicken wing to feel for Thompson instead of actually putting a body on him and boxing out, and then half-heartedly going up for a rebound with one arm as Thompson shows him what actually pursuing a rebound looks like. Here he is inexplicably leaking out in transition when the Lakers don't even have the ball, leaving Alperen Sengun completely unoccupied to cruise in for a put-back. \nApologists will point to Sunday's win over the Kings in which LeBron looked great and energized on both ends. Maybe JJ Redick's \"uncomfortable\" Saturday practice worked. But I go back to Will Wade's casual player rant, which came after his Wolfpack had beaten Texas Southern by 36 points. Anyone can look good against a bad team, and the Kings are one of the worst teams in the league. \nIf this continues for an extended time (maybe Reaves being out will bring the best out of LeBron), then we can reassess. But for now, we have to look big picture, where the numbers don't lie. Entering Sunday, the Lakers' starting lineup of Luka, LeBron, Reaves, Hachimura and Deandre Ayton was getting blitzed to the tune of minus-16.7 points per 100 possessions with what would rank as the worst defensive rating in the league, per Cleaning the Glass. Swap out LeBron for Marcus Smart and the Lakers jump to plus-14.7 with a 90th percentile defense. All told, the Lakers entered Sunday having lost LeBron's total minutes 59 points, and not a single one of the four lineups with which he has played more than 40 possessions boasted a positive rating. In fact, those lineups were a combined minus-82.2 per 100 possessions, per CTG. These are all still relatively small samples and, to be clear, LeBron is not the sole reason the Lakers are a trash defensive team. But he's certainly a real part of the problem with the Lakers need him, to whatever degree is possible for a 41-year-old guy, to be at least part of a solution.\n            ",

USC instead demanded next year's game be played during Week Zero, which would be more advantageous than a potential late-season loss to the Fighting Irish in the playoff discussion.Had Notre Dame's MOU been in play this season, the Fighting Irish would have been the selection committee's final at-large pick over Miami, given the \"assurance\" for being ranked inside the top 12.\n        \n            \n                Marcus Freeman returning to Notre Dame: Fighting Irish coach vows to 'run it back' amid reported NFL interest\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNotre Dame has already announced a home-and-home series with BYU to take place in 2026 and 2027 in place of the matchups with USC, while the Trojans are still searching for a replacement opponent.\nNotre Dame and USC put out a statement after failing to come to terms earlier this month.\"USC and Notre Dame recognize how special our rivalry is to our fans, our teams, and college football, and our institutions will continue working towards bringing back The Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh,\" Notre Dame and USC said in the joint statement. \"The rivalry between our two schools is one of the best in all of sport, and we look forward to meeting again in the future.\" Notre Dame, as an independent, will play one of the nation's most favorable slates in 2026 with USC no longer on the docket. The Fighting Irish only three true road games -- North Carolina, Syracuse and Purdue -- along with neutral-site contests against Wisconsin and Navy.\nThe Midshipmen are the only team among those five that finished bowl-eligible, and Notre Dame has won eight straight in the rivalry series, including six by at least 20 points.BYU and Miami are the only opponents on next season's schedule for Notre Dame that will have finished the 2025 campaign inside the national rankings.Before the season, Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua told Sports Illustrated that he hoped the rivalry would continue to be an annual event. \"I think Southern Cal and Notre Dame should play every year for as long as college football is played,\" he said, \"and SC knows that's how we feel.\"\n            ",

The Rams (11-4) are coming off a Thursday defeat to Seattle, 38-37 in overtime, but L.A. has already clinched a playoff berth. The Falcons (6-9) have been knocked out of postseason contention but enter off back-to-back victories, last defeating Arizona, 26-19. Drake London (knee) is questionable for Atlanta, while Davante Adams (hamstring) is doubtful for LA. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After opening at -8, the latest Falcons vs. Rams from DraftKings Sportsbook have Los Angeles as the 7-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5, down a point from the opening line.

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense and is 5-1 over his last six 'MNF' starts, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks. Finally, L.A. is just 4-7 ATS over its last 11 with a rest edge, as it enters in off a Thursday game. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Falcons vs. Rams            picksFor Rams vs. Falcons   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "description": "\n        On Christmas Eve, Baylor's basketball program announced a figuratively (and, uh, literally) big holiday surprise: 7-foot center James Nnaji, ",
    "body": "\n        On Christmas Eve, Baylor's basketball program announced a figuratively (and, uh, literally) big holiday surprise: 7-foot center James Nnaji, the No. 31 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who has played the last four seasons in the EuroLeague, has signed with the school and is eligible to play for the Bears immediately.The midseason addition of a player with immediate eligibility is unusual, though not unique, to college basketball. However, the midseason clearance of a men's player who was previously drafted by an NBA team has no precedent. And it raises plenty of questions, such as: How did this happen? Will situations like this happen with increasing frequency in the future? And through which loophole did the Bears sneak this deal?All valid questions -- and ones that coaches and college personnel themselves are asking. CBS Sports polled college coaches anonymously on the topic to gauge reaction across the sport. Their answers -- and the answers to these questions -- are below.College coaches and general managers reactReactions ranging from pragmatism to envy and anxiety echoed across the landscape over the weekend. One Big East coach told CBS Sports he has \"no problem\" with what Baylor did because it is doing what it can to improve its roster. Another coach in the Big Ten said what Baylor did was simply within the rules.\n\"They were creative enough to find a situation that fit into a narrow interpretation like all of us try to,\" said the Big Ten coach.Added a high major head coach, \"I don't fault Baylor for doing it. If the NCAA clears a kid, then it clears a kid. For us, if you ask me, do I think that a player should be able to be added after being drafted? No. It's not the process we're all into. A kid puts his name into the draft and gets drafted, his college life should be over.\"Still, others seem less enthused about the deal -- namely, about what the precedent portends for the future in the sport.\nSaid one Big 12 coach: \"[It's] up to Baylor to decide if exploiting a rule is within the culture of their program. Just because something is currently permissible doesn't make it best for the game.\"That coach seemed to echo what Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said over the weekend about the situation.\"I mean, if that's what we're going to do, shame on the NCAA,\" Izzo said. \"Shame on the coaches, too. But shame on the NCAA, because coaches are gonna do what they gotta do, I guess.\"\nIzzo said he has a call in to Bears coach Scott Drew and wants to talk with him about the situation.A major conference general manager acknowledged to CBS Sports that Baylor made a move to try and better its roster, which is the ultimate goal. Baylor just went to a place others hadn't yet gone. The interpretation of whether it was morally right or wrong, they seem to argue, is less relevant than whether moves such as this will be net-positives.\"Motherf****** will go anywhere to find someone that can help them win a basketball game right now,\" said the GM. \"I don't think it's something we will do because these guys are pros. How will they handle how a college coach coaches? That's been my thought process.\n\"Pros don't worry about winning like you expect to win in college,\" the GM added. \"You've got to really dig into the character traits and then pressure down these traits into these grown men coming back who haven't played college basketball. It's a different game than the NBA and a different game than the G League. This s*** is about winning; the NBA is about getting paid.\"Overall, there seems to be a mix of both interest in how the situation at Baylor plays out and a desire among some in the college ranks from the NCAA to, at the very least, clarify the rulebook -- if not close the loophole entirely. \"A drafted player should forfeit eligibility,\" the Big Ten coach told CBS Sports. \"And this also calls into question the draft withdrawal date and if it means anything.\"\nThe Big 12 coach agreed: \"The [loophole] should be closed so that pros cannot return to college.\"The college GM downplayed the significance of the signing and pointed to the tiny player pool from which these transactions may come as reason to believe this won't likely become a pipeline for college programs to pluck from down the road. \"I don't [think it will have a big impact on roster construction,\" the GM told CBS Sports. \"I don't think the player pool is going to be large enough. [And] I think the NCAA or the NBA is going to clip this real quick. Whoever is going to do it, better do it now, because this won't be around too much longer. \n\"I'm interested to see how it plays out with how good he really is, how much he impacts and how much they win,\" the GM added. \"Because they're going to be under scrutiny all year for it.\"Nnaji's instant eligibility at Baylor at the midway point of the college basketball season opens another strange and unexpected can of worms in the ever-evolving world of college athletics. \"It's like when NIL started, if you had money, I wasn't mad at you. Certain teams had money right out of the gate and were ahead of the game in NIL. But everyone has a chance to do it,\" a high-major head coach told CBS Sports. \"If the NCAA said it's a rule, you don't have to like it; you can just lean into it. I don't like the rule that if you get drafted, there's a loophole, but I don't fault Baylor for doing it.\"\nHow did this get cleared?When Baylor learned transfer big man Juslin Bodo Bodo was likely to be out for the year because of a summer injury, Baylor general manager Jason Smith reached out to several contacts to see if any good midyear additions might make sense for the team as a replacement option, a source told CBS Sports. Nnaji, whose representatives signaled he was interested in coming stateside, came up as the best option. So Smith worked in tandem with Nnaji's reps and the NCAA through the process to ensure he could be cleared at the midseason mark. (Nnaji's situation changed in recent months after mutually parting with Barcelona this summer, opening up the possibility of landing elsewhere.) The NCAA cleared Nnaji to play college basketball because he is an international player still within his five-year window of what would be his high school graduation, given that he is still only 21 years old. That clearance comes despite being drafted to the NBA by the Detroit Pistons in 2023. His rights were traded to the Hornets on draft night and later to the New York Knicks in 2024 as part of the deal to acquire Karl-Anthony Towns.\nHow much college eligibility does Nnaji have remaining?The NCAA's official rule on eligibility and its five-year clock allows for players to complete four years of athletic competition from their first full-time college enrollment. That means Nnaji's clearance affords him four years of eligibility. Under NCAA rules, Nnaji's qualification for eligibility is under the category of being an incoming freshman and having no previous full-time college attendance. Those qualifications come regardless of the time of year of initial enrollment. Interestingly, several other former professional players joining the college ranks -- Thierry Darlan (Santa Clara) and London Johnson (Louisville) were given two years of eligibility by the NCAA. Darlan's clock began this year, and Johnson's will begin next year. How House vs. NCAA helped Baylor (and others)Schools that opted into the House injunction, electing to share revenue with athletes, are also required to have an available roster spot in order to sign a player midseason. That legislation also expanded the number of scholarships available per men's basketball team from 13 to 15. So even with no attrition at Baylor, it has additional space carved out to make just a move like the one it is making by adding Nnaji.\nNnaji's backgroundIn 2020, Nnaji moved from Hungary, where he'd lived for several years, to Barcelona to join FC Barcelona's basketball team. That led to an escalating interest in his skill set internationally as he developed and made the A Team in 2021. He also had stints playing on loan with Girona in the Spanish Liga ACB and with Merkezefdeni, a Basketball Super League team in Turkey.Nnaji was considered a potential first-round prospect in the 2023 NBA Draft but slipped to the No. 31 overall pick on draft night -- the first selection of the second round -- after the Hornets made a draft-night trade up the board to acquire him. Despite being selected high, Nnaji never played in the NBA or G League, only in the NBA Summer League before retreating back overseas.A precedent set, and similar casesNnaji's signing on Christmas Eve ruffled feathers and, in one case, even drummed up commotion on the player front after On3 reported -- and subsequently retracted its report -- that former undrafted guard and current Chicago Bull, Trentyn Flowers, was drawing interest from 12 college teams. CBS Sports' Matt Norlander contacted numerous schools reported to be interested in courting Flowers, and six refuted the report.\nFlowers' situation is similar to Nnaji's in that he did not play college basketball -- he initially committed to Louisville before opting for a pro career -- but dissimilar in that Flowers has played in eight NBA games the last two seasons. Despite that background, Flowers is still believed to be drawing interest from college teams, though the list does not include a dozen at the moment. Other similar situations have played out in recent years involving former professional athletes, including the aforementioned Johnson, who has played professionally since 2022 and committed to Louisville earlier this year, and Darlan, a former G League guard now playing with Santa Clara. Johnson will have two years of eligibility beginning in 2026-27 after playing three years in the G League, and Darlan has two years of eligibility.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in 2026 after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2025, ",
    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in 2026 after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2025, but the top European leagues aren't going on break in the meanwhile. Arsenal and Manchester City are ready to fight for another Premier League title while Bayern Munich are once again dominating the Bundesliga standings. Elsewhere, Juventus are getting back at the top of the Serie A standings while Real Madrid finally had a positive week after some struggles. Let's take a look our Power Rankings, and as an added bonus, hand out New Year's resolutions for each team. 1. Arsenal (--)New Year's resolution: Lift a trophy, possibly the Premier League more than 20 years after the last time. After how they started the 2025-26 season, 2026 has to be the year when they will finally lift a trophy. Their last Premier League title came in 2004, and they are currently leading the standings, even though the gap to their rivals is now quite narrow. There are no more excuses: Arsenal have to win in 2026. \n        \n            \n                Are Arsenal struggling? Why Premier League's leaders seem vulnerable despite consistently winning games\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. Bayern Munich (--)New Year's resolution: Score less than three goals every single game, if possible. \nDo you remember one game this season when you saw Bayern Munich scoring less than three goals? I don't to be honest. I'd like to see them winning 1-0 at least once this season but I'm probably asking too much from Vincent Kompany's side. 55 goals scored in 15 games played so far in the German Bundesliga: 3.6 per game. I wasn't joking. 3. Manchester City (--)New Year's resolution: Convince Pep Guardiola to stay at the club beyond the summer. Manchester City are starting the new year with increasing doubts about the future of Pep Guardiola. The Spanish coached mentioned a few times that his contract expiring in 2027 doesn't really guarantee he will stay until then and there are multiple rumors about him leaving the Premier League in the summer. The English giants need to convince him to stay at least for another season. They need him, we all need him. \n4. Barcelona (--)New Year's resolution: Sign Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal, he's worth it. The English striker had a big impact on the success of the team coached by Hansi Flick so far this season and no matter what transfer business Barcelona do in the summer, they need to sign him permanently from Manchester United. He has shown to be a player who can play in this team and considering Robert Lewandowski's likely departure from the club they have to confirm him in that role. 5. PSG (--)New Year's resolution: Go back to January 2025. I mean, 2025 was absolutely magical for them and Luis Enrique. They won it all and their wish is probably to go back to one year ago when they were about to win the Treble and most notably the 2025 Champions League final against Inter. Can they do it again this season? It seems more difficult but I wouldn't rule it out. \n6. Atletico Madrid (--)New Year's resolution: Reach the last four of the Champions LeagueDiego Simeone's side are doing quiet well this season but their ambition is to do better in the European tournament and possibly ending up in the top four of the Champions League. It's been a while since they've done it and this might be a big year for them. 7. Inter (--)New Year's resolution: Zero trophies in 2025? At least one in 2026. If 2025 was an unforgettable year for PSG, 2025 was a disaster for the Nerazzurri at least until May. Losing the Serie A title on the last matchday of the season to Napoli, the 5-0 Champions League final lost to PSG and a managerial change with Simone Inzaghi leaving only a few days after the Munich final. Under Cristian Chivu it all seems much better but winning a trophy in 2026 would radically change their status after such disappointments. 8. Chelsea (--)New Year's resolution: Make Enzo Maresca happy again at the club. The last few weeks were a bit difficult for both Chelsea and Enzo Maresca. It looks like something is breaking between the club and the manager but this is not what Chelsea need right now. Maresca is doing really well and needs to continue working together with this team in the next months. Will they fix it? \n9. Real Madrid (--)New Year's resolution: Commit to their coach. They were excited about Xabi Alonso few months ago. After partying ways with Carlo Ancelotti at the end of the past season, Real Madrid started a new cycle with former midfielder Xabi Alonso. His start at the club wasn't what they hoped so far, but they should back their manager because he's one of the best around Europe. Ancelotti was great but that's the past, Xabi Alonso is the future. 10. Atalanta (--)New Year's resolution: Get over the fact Gian Piero Gasperini left. It took some time, as expected, for them to process the farewell of Gian Piero Gasperini, the manager who brought Atalanta to the elite of European soccer. Since he left to join AS Roma in the summer, Atalanta hired Ivan Juric but then sacked him few weeks ago and appointed Raffaele Palladino, who started well and might have Atalanta heading back in the right direction. It might take some time but this is the right path for their future. \n11. Liverpool (--)New Year's resolution: Make the summer signings perform as hoped. The 2025 summer signings haven't perform as they hoped so far, especially the ones of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen and Alexander Isak from Newcastle, even before his injury. If Arne Slot will be able to make them perform at their level in the second part of the season Liverpool still have chances to win trophies in 2026.\n        \n            \n                Grading most expensive 2025 summer transfers: Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz, Benjamin Sesko and more\n                \n                    Francesco Porzio                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n12. Olympique Marseille (--)New Year's resolution: Winning Ligue 1 seems impossible, but they actually can. If there is one team that can beat PSG in the long term this season, that's Olympique Marseille. Roberto De Zerbi's team are five points behind Lens and four behind PSG but they still have a shot. Winning Ligue 1 would be something historic. \n13. Newcastle (--)New Year's resolution: Forget about the last months of 2025. Despite the great impact of some new players like Nick Woltemade, who has scored nine goals so far in all competitions, their season doesn't really excite us. The first months of the 2025-26 season were not what we hoped for them but there are more games to come to turn things around. 14. Borussia Dortmund (--)New Year's resolution: Play another European final. Borussia Dortmund played the 2024 Champions League final and lost to Real Madrid. It's almost impossible to see them again play the final but, then again, it was almost impossible to see them playing in the 2024 final five months before it happened, so why not dream? 15. Galatasaray (--)New Year's resolution: Becoming the first Turkish team to win the Champions League. \nAfter what they have done in the summer there are many expectations on their performances especially in the Champions League. Having a player like Victor Osimhen can make the difference in the knockout stages of the European tournament. 16. Juventus (--)New Year's resolution: Don't sack the manager and trust Luciano Spalletti. He's the right man. After sacking two coaches in 2025 Juventus finally found, in Luciano Spalletti, the right coach to lead this team. He's already showing his importance in both domestic and European leagues. They just have to not sack him or replace him after this season and commit to his work and management. \n17. Napoli (--)New Year's resolution: Hope for Antonio Conte to stay more than two years at the club. We all know Antonio Conte and we all know what is going to happen at the end of this season when he will hint of a possible exit after two years at Napoli. It already happened last year before Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis convinced him to stay and refused to rejoin Juventus. They have to do it again. 18. Bayer Leverkusen (--)New Year's resolution: Don't sell more players to Liverpool. After selling both Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong to Liverpool, they should probably avoid allowing other players to join the English club, especially given that both performed better at Leverkusen and may now regret that decision.\n19. Sporting CP (--)New Year's resolution: Win one trophy and don't sell their strikers to a Premier League club. The Portuguese team are challenging Porto at the top of the domestic league and hoping to land in the playoffs of the Champions League. The next two games against PSG and Athletic Club will tell us more about their European expectations, after losing to Bayern Munich in the last Champions League match of 2025, but they have a chance to win at least one trophy in 2026. 20. Tottenham (--)New Year's resolution: Just win some games. I mean, what can we say more about Tottenham? They won the 2025 Europa League title, that's true, but we hoped Thomas Frank could bring some stability at the club and he hasn't so far. 21. PSV (--)New Year's resolution: Make Ivan Perisic sign a new deal. If there is one player of this team that makes me happy that's Ivan Perisic. His career seemed over two years ago, and it certainly wasn't. Let him sign a new contract! He deserves it. 22. AS Monaco (--)New Year's resolution: Find a coach who can bring the club back at the top. Another challenging season for AS Monaco. The good old days seem really far away but maybe with the right manager this team can still be back at the top. 23. Benfica (--)New Year's resolution: End up in the Champions League playoffs. Jose Mourinho's appointment was the highlight of 2025 but there is more to come next year. Qualifying for the Champions League playoffs would definitely be a big step for their new project with the Special One.  24. Club Brugge (--)New Year's resolution: Don't sell players to AC Milan. Can they survive one year without selling a player to AC Milan? Well, their striker Nicolò Tresoldi was at San Siro over the weekend watching AC Milan playing against Hellas Verona. 25. Copenaghen (--)New Year's resolution: Get in the top 24 of the league phase.  I didn't think they could make it for the playoffs but now they have a chance after winning the last away match against Villarreal. 26. Qarabag (--)New Year's resolution: Win another Champions League match. They were the surprise of the league phase in the first matches of the season but then that was it. Winning another match would mean a lot to them. 27. Eintracht Frankfurt (--)New Year's resolution: Concede fewer goals They have conceded 30 goals in 15 Bundesliga matches. With a record like that, what can they realistically hope for?28. Union Saint-Gilloise (--)28. Union Saint-Gilloise (--)New Year's resolution: Another Champions League campaign. They are at the top of the Pro League table with a one-point margin on Club Brugge, but the latest home defeat against Olympique Marseille in the Champions League wasn't what they needed to have some qualification hope. They can make it again next year. 29. Athletic Club (--)New Year's resolution: Don't sell Nico Williams in the summer.  They didn't sell Nico Williams in 2024. They didn't sell Nico Williams in 2025 after agreeing on a new deal. Can they do it again in 2026? 30. Villarreal (--)New Year's resolution: Perform better in Europe. Despite the home defeat against Barcelona they are still the biggest surprise in LaLiga, sitting fourth behind Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, but a disaster in the Champions League where they have no real chance to qualify for the playoffs with zero wins in six matches. They can do better in the last two games of the league phase. 31. Pafos (--)New Year's resolution: Let them dream once again. They are living a dream by playing in the Champions League for the first time. Let them dream again. 32. Slavia Prague (--)New Year's resolution: Do better in their last two European games. They probably deserve to do something more in the remaining two matches of the league phase, if they can. 33. Olympiacos (--)New Year's resolution: Win the Greek league and be back stronger next season in Europe. Nothing really happened for them in the Champions League this year. Win the Greek league and be back stronger next season. 34. Bodo/Glimt (--) New Year's resolution: Warmer atmosphere in their home stadium? Probably asking too much here. I thought they could do better in Europe this season, especially considering the temperatures at their home games. 35. Ajax (--)New Year's resolution: Forget about 2025. What can we say here? The biggest disappointment of the year. 36. Kairat (--)New Year's resolution: Enjoy the ride, because it's almost over.We all still love them and hope to see them back on the Champions League stage.\n            ",

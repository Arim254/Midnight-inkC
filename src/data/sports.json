The Huskies, who tied for seventh in the Big Ten, went 8-4 overall with a 5-4 mark in the Big Ten. Boise State won the Mountain West by defeating UNLV last weekend in the conference championship game for the third straight year. The Broncos are 9-4 overall and went 6-2 in the conference.

    "body": "\n        With 500 career saves within reach, veteran closer Kenley Jansen has agreed to a one-year contract with the Detroit Tigers, reports ESPN. The deal will pay him $11 million and includes a club option for 2027. The team has not yet officially announced the signing. We did not rank Jansen among our top 50 free agents this offseason.Jansen, 38, spent this past season with the Los Angeles Angels, where he went 29 for 30 in save chances with a 2.59 ERA in 59 innings. The under-the-hood numbers are not as strong as they were during Jansen's prime, though he remains a solid to above-average reliever, one who won't wilt under pressure in important late-inning situations for a contending team.With a full and healthy season in 2026, Jansen is in line to become the third pitcher in history with 500 saves. Here is the all-time saves leaderboard:Mariano Rivera: 652 (Hall of Famer)Trevor Hoffman: 601 (Hall of Famer)Lee Smith: 478 (Hall of Famer)Kenley Jansen: 476Craig Kimbrel: 440Jansen needs 24 saves to join the 500-saves club, a total he has eclipsed in every 162-game season since 2012. Does 500 saves punch his ticket to the Hall of Fame? Jansen is one of the best relievers of his generation, and 500 saves, while not as sexy as 500 home runs, is an awfully big number. You don't get there without longevity and effectiveness. Cooperstown beckons.\n\"Four more years. That's the goal, man,\" Jansen told reporters, including the Associated Press, when asked how much longer he wants to play on the final day of the 2025 regular season.  \"The offseason begins tomorrow. No kidding. I'm  getting in my gym at 5 a.m. I want to drop a few more pounds, get  stronger, get a little quicker. I'm dedicated.\"As for the 2026 Tigers, Jansen will step into the closer's role, allowing manager A.J. Hinch to use righties Kyle Finnegan and Will Vest as \"Moment of Truth\" relievers who pitch in high-leverage situations regardless of the inning. With the caveat that there is a long way to go between now and Opening Day, Detroit's bullpen currently looks like this:Closer: RHP Kenley JansenSetup: RHP Kyle Finnegan and RHP Will VestMiddle: RHP Beau Brieske, LHP Tyler Holton, LHP Bailey HornLong: RHP Brenan Hanifee and LHP Brant HurterThere's room for another established reliever, perhaps a lefty who misses more bats than Holton, Hinch's current go-to southpaw. There is plenty of offseason to sort that out. For now, though, Jansen gives the Tigers an established closer, one who pushes Finnegan and Vest into setup roles. Jansen, meanwhile, will continue his march to 500 saves.\nThe Tigers went 87-75 in 2025, one game better than 2024. They were eliminated from the postseason in Game 5 of the ALDS in both seasons.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most prestigious award in college football will be handed out Saturday night as four of the top athletes in the nation descend upon New York City for the 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is seen as the favorite to capture the prize after leading the Hoosiers to their best season in program history, but he will have stiff competition from other top signal callers from around the sport. Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love round out the list of four finalists that will take the stage inside the Lincoln Center's Appel Room. Mendoza and Sayin are gearing up for an appearance in the College Football Playoff after dueling in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Indiana won to capture its first outright conference title in 80 years. Pavia and Love, obviously, had successful seasons while starring for a pair of 10-win programs. The odds favor another quarterback winning the Heisman after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter earned the award last season. Hunter's triumph snapped a streak of three straight quarterback Heisman winners. A quarterback also won the Heisman seven times from 2016-23. The 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony will begin at 7 p.m. ET and air on ESPN. It can also be streamed live on fuboTV (Try for free).  \nOdds in parentheses below via DraftKings Sportsbook.2025 Heisman Trophy finalists, oddsFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (-2500): Mendoza took a commanding lead in the Heisman standings following a heroic performance in the Big Ten Championship Game. He completed 15 of his 23 pass attempts for 222 yards and the decisive 17-yard touchdown to wide receiver Elijah Sarratt. Mendoza leads the nation with 33 touchdowns passing to just six interceptions and he's also rushed for another six touchdowns on the ground. He would be the first Heisman Trophy winner in Indiana history. Diego Pavia, QB, Vanderbilt (+1100): Like Mendoza, Pavia can make history as Vanderbilt's first Heisman recipient. He's already lead the Commodores to their first 10-win season in program history, capped by their first victory against Tennessee since 2018. Pavia's established himself as one of the most electric playmakers in the country. He averaged 465.5 total yards per game and scored 16 total touchdowns in Vanderbilt's final four games. Jeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (+25000): Love is holding it down as the only non-quarterback that made the cut as a Heisman finalist. It's not hard to see why. He almost singlehandedly provided the offensive firepower for a Notre Dame team that just missed out on the College Football Playoff. He was one of just two players to average at least 6.9 yards per carry while toting the rock over 150 times. His 18 touchdowns rushing also ranked third in the FBS. \nJulian Sayin, QB, Ohio State (+50000): Sayin is a smooth operator in Ohio State's explosive offense. His 78.4% completion percentage leads the nation and his 182.1 passer rating is first among FBS quarterbacks with at least 100 pass attempts on the year. He failed to complete 70% of his passes in just two games all season. Though Ohio State's elite skill position players get a lot of credit for Sayin's success, his own talent is evident with his ability to deliver the ball accurately to every level of the field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers' return to the gridiron is being fast-tracked, as the Indianapolis Colts have activated the 44-year-old quarterback for their Week 15 road matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. Rivers will start on Sunday, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reports, after ending his five-year retirement on Tuesday by signing with the Colts practice squad. Now, he's on the verge of once again being a starting quarterback. The Colts are desperate at quarterback. Daniel Jones suffered a torn Achilles in last Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture. Rookie Riley Leonard, who was expected to replace Jones in the starting lineup, has a knee injury, but is off the injury report. With the Colts' season on the line at 8-5, they are likely turning to the quarterback that last led them to the playoffs.Rivers spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, but his last season came in 2020 with the Colts. He threw for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while the Colts went 11-5 and earned a wild card spot. Rivers' final NFL game came on Jan. 9, 2021 -- a 27-24 playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills, in which he completed 27 of 46 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns. An eight-time Pro Bowler, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter in his incredible career, and ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). Fewer than five months ago, Rivers signed a one-day contract with the Chargers and announced his retirement. The franchise even put out an emotional video. But things have changed and Rivers will be back in an NFL uniform on Sunday in Seattle. \nWhy did the Colts sign Rivers?Why did the Colts go and sign the 44-year-old Rivers instead of a free agent like Ryan Tannehill, or maybe even another NFL legend like Tom Brady? It's likely because Rivers has familiarity with the Colts franchise, coach Shane Steichen and the team's offensive system. Rivers has been a high school football coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic, where he coaches his son Gunner Rivers -- who is also a quarterback. CBS Sports broadcaster and NFL legend J.J. Watt recently learned that Rivers ran the same offense as the Colts for his son's team. If you don't believe that, Rivers and Steichen apparently spoke weekly about their scheme, discussing plays and even film. It's a reason why the Colts are expected to start Rivers five days after he rejoined the NFL. \n        \n            \n                Philip Rivers' impossible comeback, Joe Burrow's unrest and what sources are saying around the NFL\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe historical impactIf he starts as expected, Rivers will become the fifth quarterback to start an NFL game at age 44 or older. He adds his name to a list that includes Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Sunday marks 1,800 days since Rivers' last NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research. It's the longest layoff by a 40-year-old starting quarterback in NFL history. The previous record was DeBerg in 1998 (1,777 days). \nRivers is older than Steichen and Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, making it the sixth instance since 1950 where a starting quarterback was older than both head coaches in a game. In fact, Rivers is older than 13 NFL head coaches. Rivers has 10 children and is a grandfather. Now, he has been charged with saving the Colts' season. The matchup against SeattleThe Seahawks are a tough matchup for Rivers right off the bat, as Seattle already matched its win total from last season at 10-3 and boasts a ferocious defense. This unit ranks second in the NFL in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per play allowed (4.5) and third-down defense (33%). Seattle has allowed just nine total points over the past two games, and leads the NFL with six non-offensive touchdowns.\nUnfortunately for the Colts, the Week 15 matchup against Seattle isn't the only tough game remaining on the schedule. Indy actually has the toughest remaining schedule in the NFL (.692 opponent win percentage). Three of the Colts' final four opponents rank top seven in the NFL in pressures. WeekOpponent15at Seattle Seahawks16vs. San Francisco 49ers17vs. Jacksonville Jaguars18at Houston TexansColts' chances to make the playoffsWhat are the chances Rivers can come in and deliver for the Colts, stop their slide and get Indy back to the postseason? Let's take a look at what SportsLine's data says:TeamChances to win AFC SouthChances to make playoffsJacksonville Jaguars (9-4)49.6%96.5%Houston Texans (8-5)44.2%86.7%Indianapolis Colts (8-5)6.3%41.8%AFC playoff picture Here is how the AFC looks through 14 weeksSeedTeam1.Denver Broncos (11-2)2.New England Patriots (11-2)3.Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)4.Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)5.Los Angeles Chargers (9-4)6.Buffalo Bills (9-4)7.Houston Texans (8-5)***ON THE BUBBLE8.Indianapolis Colts (8-5)9.Baltimore Ravens (6-7)10.Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)11.Miami Dolphins (6-7)12.Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)As the data indicates, losing Jones is a massive blow. But the Colts were crashing even before their quarterback went down. The Colts lost three straight games since starting 8-2, and also lost star cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck) to injury. Indianapolis is in danger of becoming the first NFL team to start 8-2 or better and miss the playoffs since the 1995 Oakland Raiders, but the Colts are hoping this Hail Mary at quarterback pays immediate dividends. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Vegas! For the third time in as many seasons, the NBA Cup is shifting to Sin City for its dramatic conclusion, and the league couldn't have asked for a more compelling group of finalists. The defending champion (June variety, not Cup variety) Oklahoma City Thunder, the league's brightest young star in Victor Wembanyama, the Eastern Conference favorite New York Knicks, and the Orlando Magic, who are now 14-6 since their 1-4 start.The players on our four finalists have all earned at least six figures, but there's still quite a bit of money on the line. Semifinals losers will pocket $102,994 per player, while the loser of the championship game doubles that figure for $205,988. The winner of the whole tournament walks away with $514,971 per player, but be honest, you're more interested in how you can make money off of this thing than the players. Fortunately, we've got you covered. Below are our best bets for both semifinal matchups on Saturday.Orlando Magic vs. New York Knicks\nThe Magic have developed a bit of a reputation for playing through injuries lately, but which injuries are essential here? The Magic turned their season around with Paolo Banchero sidelined, but since his rookie year, they are 31-27 without him in the lineup. Now Banchero is back, but just like last season, Franz Wagner got hurt soon after. That's a tougher injury for the Magic to stomach. Orlando is 13-22 without Wagner in the lineup in that same span. This season, Magic lineups featuring Banchero but no Wagner have been outscored by 5.7 points per 100 possessions, so the safe pick here is the Knicks, especially now that OG Anunoby is back in the fold. The Pick: Knicks -5.5I'm leaning under for a few reasons. There's the fact that this is a big game in an unusual environment that tips at a weird time (2:30 local), and that could lead to shooting struggles as players deal with the disturbance to their routine. We have a relatively slow Knicks team on one end of the floor and a Magic team that will be playing hard on the other, seeking some measure of revenge after Wagner got hurt against New York. And then there's the matter of history. Every NBA Cup game in Vegas that did not involve Tyrese Haliburton went under this total. Granted, that's only four games, so take it with a grain of salt, but as we saw last postseason, Haliburton is immune to pressure. Everyone else seems to play a bit tight under the bright lights, so altogether, I have a slight under lean. The Pick: Under 224.5\nI'm working a theory here: Paolo Banchero has averaged 22.8 shots per game in the playoffs in his career. Is this a playoff game? No. But he tends to be at his most shot-happy in big games, and by regular-season standards, this one qualifies, especially with Wagner out. So I'm going to take Banchero's over on the basis of volume. He'll put up a lot of shots and hit enough to hit the over. The Pick: Banchero Over 22.5 PointsSan Antonio Spurs vs. Oklahoma City Thunder\nIf you just want to know who's going to win the game? You should pick the Thunder because they've only lost once. Picking them to lose a game is irresponsible. Picking their opponent to cover? A bit more plausible. The Thunder are only 14-11 against the spread. In fairness, that's mostly because their spreads are typically massive, but that's the case here. The Spurs are 10.5-point underdogs. Well, they've only lost three games by double digits all season, and they've never lost by more than 13. The Spurs don't really get blown out. Their three-headed guard monster of De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and Dylan Harper is as good an answer to Oklahoma City's ball-pressure as there is in the NBA. The Spurs are a pretty low-turnover team, and they draw a fair number of fouls, both of which are useful against the Thunder. Plus, Victor Wembanyama is expected back. That's a nice little cherry on top here. The Pick: Spurs +10.5\nThe Thunder rank just 15th in pace for the season... but fourth since Jalen Williams returned to the lineup. Their lowest-scoring game since then, their blowout quarterfinal win over the Suns, totaled 227 points, just half a point under this game's total. They've blown by it in their five other games in that span. The Thunder have a historic defense, but if both teams are flying up and down the floor, the points can rack up pretty quickly, even if they aren't coming all that efficiently. These are two of the NBA's most athletic groups, so I'm expecting a more offensive game. The Pick: Over 227.5\nThere's going to be an instinct to go under on Wembanyama's lines for fear of a minutes limit. Counterpoint: he averaged over 30 minutes in games in which he returned from an absence last season. Obviously, he's never returned from an absence this long before, but the Spurs have tended to allow him most of his usual workload in return games before. Plus, Wembanyama absolutely relishes big moments, and he's had so few of them in the NBA. Think of opening night or the Paris trip last year. He's going to want to put on a show, especially against Chet Holmgren. I'm expecting fireworks. The Pick: Wembanyama Over 17.5 Points\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool were able to get back to their winning ways in the Premier League, defeating Brighton 2-0 at Anfield on Saturday. A brace from Hugo Ekitike was enough to keep Liverpool in front of Brighton, but the second goal was a significant one due to it being assisted by Mohamed Salah following his whirlwind week with the club. Following positive discussions with Arne Slot, Salah was included in the squad and got called upon much earlier than many would've expected, as Joe Gomez left the match due to an injury, and Salah was introduced in the 22nd minute of play. It wasn't a vintage performance by any sense of the term, with him taking three shots and netting an assist, but after claiming that the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, any contribution is more than what was expected.\nSalah will now depart to join the Egyptian national team for the Africa Cup of Nations, but manager Arne Slot expects him to come back to the club at the conclusion of the tournament amid transfer speculation. \"Actions speak louder than what I can say about it, [Salah] was here, so that tells you how the conversation yesterday went, and he was the first substitute I made, so that already gives an answer to all the questions that you have,\" Slot said following the match.\"He goes to the AFCON, and we have a lot of games to play and yeah, he's a Liverpool player, so I expect him to be back afterwards.\"\nWith interest from the Saudi Premier League, there is wonder of where Salah will play his soccer once the January transfer window opens, but if his manager is to be believed, it will be at Liverpool. Granted, there isn't much else that Slot can say publicly, but after Salah was benched in three consecutive matches and left out of the squad for their 1-0 victory over Inter in Champions League play midweek, this is an improvement.Fans also chanted Salah's name following the full-time whistle as he was the last player to leave the pitch at Anfield. It wasn't a moment that read as a goodbye from Liverpool, but it was something that was meaningful for him.\nThat was Salah's third Premier League assist of the season and one that helped showcase the breakout that Ekitike is having for the Reds. He now has seven goals in the league, and in a season that has seen Salah's scoring dip while Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz have struggled to integrate into the side, his performances have been a silver lining for Liverpool.\nWithout Salah, Ekitike will be relied on, but if the Reds can get the two of them going together following AFCON, there could be hope for the season with Salah's future looking a little more red than last week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of Pacific Northwest foes will meet to kick off the college football bowl game schedule on Saturday when Washington and Boise State duel in the LA Bowl. Despite their close proximity in bordering states, it is just the seventh all-time meeting between the programs, and it marks their third bowl game matchup. A 10-win season is on the line for the Broncos, who also seek the first win over a Big Ten program in their storied history. The Huskies, meanwhile, could end the second year of the Jedd Fisch era with a ninth win and build momentum towards what should be a highly anticipated Year 3. Boise State fell short of its quest for a repeat College Football Playoff berth, but it did secure a spot in the LA Bowl by way of winning the Mountain West Championship Game. The Broncos became the first team to ever win the conference three years in a row, and their seventh title is the most in league history. They closed their Mountain West membership on top and will join the new-look Pac-12 next season. Washington was a CFP hopeful, as well, but had its chances dashed when it lost to rival Oregon in the regular-season finale. It is more than a touchdown favorite, per FanDuel, to bounce back with a victory in bowl season.  Washington vs. Boise State: Need to know Three-headed monster: Boise State this season faced the impossible task of replacing Ashton Jeanty. Instead of putting the onus on one player, it nearly matched the former Heisman Trophy finalist's 2024 production with three prolific running backs. Dylan Riley, Sire Gaines and Malik Sherrod each racked up at least 400 rushing yards and six total touchdowns and modernized the Broncos' backfield as reliable receivers, as well. That trio combined for 2,752 yards from scrimmage in the regular season and conference championship game. Coleman does it all: Washington features a versatile running back of its own. Jonah Coleman, a CBS Sports Midseason All-American, scored a Big Ten-best 16 total touchdowns across 11 games in what has been the best campaign of his career. A knee injury limited him for all of November, but if he is closer to full strength for the LA Bowl, the senior is a sure bet to handle 15-20 touches and to find the end zone at least once. \nMVP Madsen: Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen missed three games and nearly all of a fourth with a lower leg injury but returned in grand fashion for the Mountain West title game. The second-year starter passed for three touchdowns and ran for another in one of his most productive games of the season and earned the conference championship game MVP award for his efforts. He should be in the lineup again Saturday. Husky defense flexes down the stretch: Washington boasts the more consistent defense of the two in this matchup, and it closed the regular season on a hot streak. While they did surrender 26 points to Oregon in the finale, none of the Huskies' three prior opponents put more than 14 points on the scoreboard. And not a single team this season -- yes, that includes Ohio State, Illinois, Michigan and Oregon -- notched more than three touchdowns in a game against the nation's No. 22 scoring defense.

Conventional wisdom says to take the Broncos against the spread. This is not, however, the same caliber of Boise State team that made the CFP a year ago. The Broncos scored just seven total points in four different games this season, including in their lone matchup with a Power Four team (a 28-7 loss to Notre Dame). Washington, on the other hand, made light work of all of its non-Big Ten opponents and scored at least 38 points in the process. The star trio of Demond Willliams Jr., Denzel Boston and Coleman should lead the Huskies to a win by double digits.

    "body": "\n        The Army vs. Navy Game is a spectacle like no other. Every year, these two storied service academies get together to cap the college football regular season, and this year will be no different. The Commander-in-Chief's Trophy is on the line as the pageantry will again be a sight to behold. What also will be a sight to behold, as is usually the case, are the uniforms that will be worn by the Black Knights and Midshipmen. As is the case for some time, when the two teams meet this year on Dec. 13 in Baltimore they will wear special uniforms for the occasion. The Army-Navy Game is an opportunity for the two service academies to pay tribute the history of their branch of the armed forces, and the uniforms have become a big part of that. Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.Army uniforms 2025Both teams unveiled their uniforms for the 2025 Army-Navy game, and both will pay tribute to 250 years of service in this year's game. Army was founded as the Continental Army in 1775 ahead of the Revolutionary War and will pay homage to those roots, as well as those who have died in service of their country.\nThe marble coloring of the uniform is a tribute to the headstones for soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery, while a thin purple outline around the numbers honors those who received the Purple Heart. The helmets feature the U.S. Army seal and the Espontoon, representing the Army's role as the \"tip of the spear.\" On the uniforms themselves, players will wear The Great Seal on their shoulders and have nameplates using the Constitution font. \nNavy uniforms 2025Navy's uniforms will also look back to their founding, with helmets honoring the USS Constitution and the six ships that founded the U.S. Navy. \nThe copper color of the helmets represents the copper sheeting the USS Constitution was covered in to protect its wooden hull. The helmets also feature a sketch of the USS Constitution on one side with the original USN mark on the other.The font choice for Navy on the uniform is pulled from the typography used in the \"Act to Provide Naval Armament\" document, which authorized the creation of the first naval fleet. The six ropes on the sleeves and collar represent the six original ships in that fleet, and the pants and helmet feature those same ropes, with 126 knots to commemorate the 126th playing of Army-Navy. \nThis year's Army-Navy game will be a battle between quality teams, as Army is 5-4 on the season and Navy is 8-2 and sits atop the American Conference standings with two games to go before the Black Knights.\n            ",

    "body": "\nRaiders running back Ashton Jeanty is one of the rare rookie running backs selected in the first 10 picks of an NFL Draft who hasn't had a monstrous rookie campaign. However, few running backs have been selected by a team with an offense as dysfunctional as Las Vegas' has been the majority of the season, with the Raiders ranking last in the NFL in scoring at 15.1 points per game. When the Raiders do score, it's often because of Jeanty, and at +175 odds at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has Jeanty as one of its top values for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets at online sports betting sites. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 15 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt and Texans wide receiver Jayden Higgins to cash for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 15 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at DraftKings, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 15 NFL picks. Best Week 15 NFL anytime touchdown picks:Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+175)Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+120)Jayden Higgins, Texans (+310)\nAshton Jeanty, Raiders (+175)Jeanty played 70% of snaps last week for his sixth straight week reaching that snap percentage. The rookie played 96% of snaps the week before, as Las Vegas' poor record hasn't limited how much it wants to utilize Jeanty. The No. 6 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is the Raiders' unquestioned top playmaker, and he's accounted for 38.1% of the team's touchdowns this season. The Raiders play the Eagles, who have allowed at least one touchdown to the opposing team's running back in back-to-back weeks, and Jeanty is the only Raiders player with a rushing touchdown this season.\nKareem Hunt, Chiefs (+120)Hunt has continued to play the majority of running back snaps, even with the return of Isiah Pacheco in the last two games. Hunt has played at least 59% of snaps in all five weeks since Pacheco suffered his initial injury, and Hunt has scored at least one touchdown in four of those five contests. He had a 2-yard touchdown run last week for his sixth touchdown over the last six weeks. The Chiefs play the Chargers in a must-win game for Kansas City to keep its postseason hopes alive, and Los Angeles has allowed at least one running back touchdown in two of its last three games. The model projects Hunt to score in more than 50% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. \nJayden Higgins, Texans (+310)Higgins has scored a touchdown in two of his last five games, and he's taken on a more impactful role in the offense in recent weeks. The second-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft had a slower start, but after seeing more than four targets just once over his first eight games, Higgins has at least five targets in five straight contests, averaging 6.6 targets per game during that stretch. The 22-year-old has more than 40 yards in three of five games after failing to reach that total in any of his first eight games. The Texans are 9.5-point favorites against the Cardinals, who have the 26th-ranked scoring defense in the league, so there should be multiple scoring opportunities. At longer than 3-1 odds, the value sees strong value in Higgins for Week 15 anytime TD scorer bets. \nWant more Week 15 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 15.

John Cena is set for his WWE farewell as part of Saturday Night's Main Event. The legendary wrestler completes a year-long goodbye to professional wrestling in Washington D.C. when he takes on Gunther in his final match in active competition. Gunther stood tall at the end of a 16-man tournament featuring superstars from Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and surprise opponents from Cena's past. After losing the world heavyweight title to Jey Uso at WrestleMania 41, Gunther had an odd year. He lost his mind as fans taunted him for tapping out against Uso and attacked both Michael Cole and Pat McAfee, which led to a match with McAfee at Backlash. Gunther then beat Uso in a rematch to reclaim the world heavyweight title before a detour to take on a retiring Goldberg. Gunther then dropped the world heavyweight title at SummerSlam before going on hiatus for multiple injuries.Cena's final year has been up and down with some incredible highs and a couple forgettable lows. He began the year by coming up short in the Royal Rumble when it was down to him and Jey Uso. Then, the infamous heel turn at the Elimination Chamber when Cena joined forces with The Rock and Travis Scott to beat down Cody Rhodes after earning his spot at WrestleMania. Cena then beat Rhodes at the event to break the record of most recognized championships at 17. After the title run and subsequent face turn came the return of Brock Lesnar to the fold where he and Cena faced off at Wrestlepalooza. Cena has also had fun throwback matches with CM Punk and AJ Styles along the way.Saturday night's card will also feature three matches between talents from Raw and SmackDown against talents from NXT, as one of Cena's final requests from the promotion was to showcase the future talent of the business against the top stars of today. That includes undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes taking on NXT champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee in tag team action against Je'Von Evans and Leon Slater as well as Bayley taking on Sol Ruca.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWhere to watch 2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main EventDate: Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C.Start time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: Peacock (subscription required)2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main Event match cardJohn Cena vs. GuntherCody Rhodes vs. Oba FemiBayley vs. Sol RucaAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je'Von Evans & Leon Slater\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Brandon Royval and Manel Kape want the next shot at UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van. Royval and Kape have an important audition on their hands at UFC Fight Night on Saturday, the final event of 2025 before UFC moves to Paramount+.Royval (17-8) is the most exciting flyweight contender around. He holds the solo record for most Fight of the Night bonuses in the division's history, and is tied for most flyweight performance bonuses. \"Raw Dog\" is kicking himself for his recent loss to Van, a Fight of the Year frontrunner. On one hand, Royval wants to mature into a more thoughtful fighter. On the other hand, he wants to see if Kape has what it takes to survive a firefight.\"It depends on how I show up. I want to be smart and tactical, but my gut feeling is to put Manel Kape in a fight and see what the f-- is up with him,\" Royval told CBS Sports. \"I feel he hasn't been in a real fight in the UFC. No one has tested that part of him. In a fistfight, I bet on myself over the entire world. I bet I can outwill him. That's for damn sure.\"I fought Joshua Van as dumb as I could fight somebody. I knew I would do that. I wanted to box him in the pocket. I wanted to prove something. It didn't work out necessarily. That being said, I want to out-technique Manel Kape, but if it ends up in a fist fight, there's nothing wrong with that either.\"\nKape (21-7) warns Royval to think twice about brawling with him. Kape is one knockout away from tying the record for most divisional history. His precision is reflected in the statistics: better striking accuracy, defense, and takedown defense than Royval. Kape has won six of his last seven fights, and a win over Royval (No. 2) could put him in the perfect position to earn the next shot at Van.\"I've been [studying] Brandon Royval a lot. To me, it's like I'm  fighting someone familiar,\" Kape told reporters on Wednesday. \"In training, everybody wants to look like  Brandon Royval, imitate him, for me it's (the) usual. I'll be very comfortable on Saturday night.\"I'm just going to prove that I'm the man. I'm the fighter with the  better style to be a champion. I'm the fighter that this division  needs.\"  \nCheck out the full interview with Brandon Royval below.\nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassManel Kape -140Brandon Royval +100FlyweightKevin Vallejos -340Giga Chikadze +270FeatherweightCezary Oleksiejczuk -205Cesar Almeida +170  MiddleweightMelquizael Costa -125Morgan Charriere +105FeatherweightKennedy Nzechukwu -192Marcus Buchecha +110HeavyweightKing Green -192Lance Gibson Jr. +160  160-pound catchweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Dec. 13 | Start time: 10 p.m. ETLocation: UFC Apex -- Las VegasTV Channel: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  PredictionBrandon Royval vs. Manel Kape: Kape has never fought five rounds. His closest experience is a fourth-round submission win on the regional scene 10 years ago. Royval puts opponents in deep waters and edges out decisions. Just ask Tatsuro Taira, who Royval beat by split decision last year. The terms for Saturday's fight benefit Royval more than his opponent. The question is how much success will Kape have early in the fight. He's more powerful and technically proficient than Royval statistically. Royval's wrestling has improved, but it hasn't been his bread and butter. A textbook \"Raw Dog\" brawl is Royval's best chance to win. However, I worry Royval's chin gets cracked in the process, or he loses too many rounds early to cover ground late. Pick: Kape via KO3\n            ",

    "body": "\nTeams outside of the NFC playoff picture will meet on 'Sunday Night Football' when the Dallas Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings. Dallas (6-6-1) is coming off a Thursday loss to Detroit, 44-30, which ended the Cowboys' three-game win streak. Minnesota (5-8) ended a four-game slide with a stunning 31-0 victory over Washington in Week 14. The Vikings would be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to Dallas.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Dallas has won each of the last three meetings, which all came on the road. The latest Vikings vs. Cowboys odds have Dallas as 5.5-point favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 47.5 via SportsLine consensus.

Last week saw Minnesota play its most complete game of the year, scoring its second-most points (31) while allowing its fewest (0) as J.J. McCarthy had his best game as a pro. The second-year QB had three passing touchdowns and no turnovers as he has a great chance of continuing that type of production versus Dallas' 31st-ranked scoring defense. The Cowboys rank dead last, however, in passing defense, with additional bottom-two rankings in both third-down defense and redzone defense. The Vikings' defense is light years ahead of the Cowboys, with the former ranking No. 3 in the redzone and No. 4 against the pass. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Cowboys can coverThe Cowboys have covered in four of their last five home games in 2025, while the Vikings have dropped four of their last five, overall, versus the spread. Dallas' success is predicated on its offense, which is elite, as Dak Prescott leads the NFL in both passing yards and QBR, as the Cowboys rank first in total yards and third in points scored. At home, the Cowboys are averaging 32.7 points, which is twice as much as the 16 ppg that the Vikings are averaging outside of Minneapolis. Additionally, no team has committed more turnovers than the Vikings, who also have the league's second-worst turnover differential, and giving the ball away will only allow Dallas' high-octane offense to put more points on the scoreboard. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Vikings picksSportsLine's model has simulated Vikings vs. Cowboys 10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 50 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick.         You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Cowboys vs. Vikings, and which side of the spread hits 60% of the time in an A-rated pick?

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.               What do the numbers mean?             \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                          To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.               What do the numbers mean?             \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                          To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                          If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                      Ready to get off on the right foot?

    "body": "\n        Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman Trophy as the most outstanding player in college football. He beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love and Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin for the honor.Mendoza came from humble beginnings, rated as the No. 134 quarterback in the Class of 2022. Before he earned a late offer from California, he was set to go to Yale and play in the Ivy League. Even after arriving in Berkeley, he had to battle for the starting job each season before finally settling in and breaking out as a sophomore.After that impressive run, Mendoza became one of the hottest commodities in the transfer portal. Instead of choosing a traditional power, he was sold on Indiana coach Curt Cignetti, offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and a rising program in Bloomington. His brother Alberto was also a quarterback at the school, but the addition of Fernando proved to be one of the greatest in program history.During Indiana's historic run to the No. 1 overall seed in the College Football Playoff, Mendoza was sensational. The junior completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards and led college football with 33 passing touchdowns. The Hoosiers won the Big Ten outright for the first time since 1945 with a perfect 13-0 record.\nUnlike nearly every other candidate, Mendoza had multiple Heisman moments. In a 27-24 comeback win against Penn State, he led a game-winning drive and connected with Omar Cooper on an acrobatic touchdown that will be replayed for years. In the Big Ten Championship Game against Ohio State, he took a third-down snap and hit Charlie Becker for a 33-yard pass that helped the Hoosiers run out the clock in a 13-10 upset.\nNow, the Heisman winner prepares to take Indiana into the CFP. The Hoosiers play the winner of No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Alabama in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Indiana has never won a national championship. Surprisingly, Mendoza is the first Heisman Trophy winner to play in the CFP since Alabama's Bryce Young in 2021. Young led the Crimson Tide to the national title game before falling just short to rival Georgia. Between 2014 and 2021, seven of the eight Heisman winners earned a trip to the CFP. \nMendoza is also the first Big Ten player to win the Heisman Trophy since Ohio State's Troy Smith in 2006, and just the second in the 21st Century. USC and Oregon have produced a combined five Heismans since 2000, but all came while members of the Pac-12. Indiana has not produced a Heisman finalist since running back Anthony Thompson in 1989. Elevating the HoosiersIndiana reached the College Football Playoff last season, but lost by double-digits against Notre Dame as the offense struggled to create opportunities. Statistically, the unit hasn't been much different in 2025. Against elite competition, though, Mendoza has proven to be a significant upgrade. In historic wins over No. 1 Ohio State and No. 3 Oregon, Mendoza completed 65% of his passes and averaged 8.1 yards per attempt against two of the best defenses in college football. He completed the game-changing 33-yard pass against Ohio State to run out the clock. Total stats tell part of the story, but his ascension in key moments has been the difference between excellent and national caliber at Indiana. \n            ",

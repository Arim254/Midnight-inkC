    "body": "\n        Teams coming off byes but going in opposite directions will meet in the 'Sunday Night Football' NFL Week 13 matchup as the Denver Broncos visit the Washington Commanders. Denver (9-2) has won eight in a row and defeated Kansas City, 22-19, in its last game. Meanwhile, Washington has lost six in a row, most recently falling to Miami, 16-13, in the first-ever NFL Madrid Game on Nov. 16. Jayden Daniels (elbow), who has been out since Week 9, has been ruled out. However, Terry McLaurin will return for Washington, as will reigning Defensive Player of the Year, Patrick Surtain II, for Denver. Broncos safety, Talanoa Hufanga, who was originally listed as questionable with an illness, is active.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md. The teams have alternated wins and losses over their last eight matchups, with Washington prevailing in the last meeting in 2023. The latest Commanders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 6-point road favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 43.5 via SportsLine consensus. Denver is 5-6 against the spread this season, while Washington is 3-8 ATS. The Under is a combined 14-8 for the two squads in 2025.

That contrasts with Washington which has not only lost six in a row straight up, but the Commanders have also lost versus the spread in all six of those. The Broncos possess an elite defense, leading the NFL in sacks, having allowed the fewest passing touchdowns, and holding opponents to a league-low in yards per rush. The defense gets another boost with cornerback Surtain II (pectoral) cleared to play. At the other end of the spectrum is Washington's defense, which has bottom-five rankings in points allowed, yards allowed and turnovers forced. Washington has allowed an average of 34 points over its last five games, while the Broncos haven't given up 34 points in any game this season. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Commanders can coverWashington HC Dan Quinn took over defensive play-calling duties prior to the team's last game, and the results were instant as the Commanders gave up just 16 points and a season-low of 142 passing yards. That's a promising sign heading into SNF, especially facing a Broncos offense that does not travel. The Broncos are averaging just 18 points over their last four road games, and they've failed to rush for more than 100 yards in three straight games overall. While Daniels' return is in doubt, receiver Terry McLaurin (quad) has been cleared to return after being out since Week 8, and he had 54 yards and a touchdown in his last game versus the Broncos. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Broncos vs. Commanders picksSportsLine's model has simulated Commanders vs. Broncos 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 45 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season has officially reached its home stretch. As we march further into Week 13 after Thanksgiving's tripleheader and a Black Friday upset, only five full weeks of regular-season action remain until the start of the playoffs. The postseason picture is far from finalized, but it's really taking shape -- including in the fight for top seeding -- thanks to late-year contests.The current field features a bevy of unexpected heavyweights, including the Denver Broncos, who entered \"Sunday Night Football\" on an eight-game winning streak; the Chicago Bears, who overpowered the reigning champion Philadelphia Eagles a day after Thanksgiving; and the Seattle Seahawks, who've enjoyed top-level production from Sam Darnold under center.Where, exactly, do all the playoff contenders sit as Week 13 winds down? Which teams would be in the postseason if the schedule were halted today? And which clubs still have a shot to sneak into the mix down the stretch? Below is an updated rundown of the entire playoff picture, complete with remaining schedules for primary contenders:Complete playoff pictureThis is the NFL playoff picture as it stands, with the following teams tabbed for postseason spots:\nAFC standingsNew England Patriots (10-2)Denver Broncos (9-2)Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4)Baltimore Ravens (6-6)Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Indianapolis Colts (8-4)Buffalo Bills (8-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New England Patriots (10-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Giants, vs. Bills, at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsDrake Maye is still on an MVP-caliber run as the face of Mike Vrabel's lineup, and the remaining slate sets them up well for the Patriots' first AFC East title since Tom Brady's final season with the club in 2019. Three of the Pats' final five opponents have losing records, and three of those five fall within the division.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Denver Broncos (9-2)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, at Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersDenver is buoyed by Bo Nix's late-game composure and a stellar defense led by Vance Joseph. Dates with the rival Chiefs and Chargers in the final two weeks of the season will likely determine whether the Broncos can rob Kansas City of its 10th straight division crown. But this group is all but a lock to play January ball.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Colts, vs. Jets, at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe mercurial Jaguars have been undisciplined for much of the year, but they've now won three of their last four, rolling over the lowly Titans on Sunday. Their light late-season schedule might send Liam Coen's squad into the dance with confidence.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Baltimore Ravens (6-6)Remaining schedule: vs. Steelers, at Bengals, vs. Patriots, at Packers, at SteelersThe Ravens backed into the AFC North lead thanks to the Steelers' loss to the Bills. Though talented, they are just so sloppy, with Lamar Jackson in a funk and John Harbaugh's group losing the ball like crazy on Thanksgiving. The division could come down to a Week 18 game in Pittsburgh. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Eagles, at Chiefs, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosAmong the current wild card contenders, the Chargers might be in the most danger of losing their spot entirely despite a convincing win over the Raiders in Week 13. Down the stretch, the Bolts will be up against some of the NFL's best defenses while struggling to keep Justin Herbert comfortable behind a depleted offensive line.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Indianapolis Colts (8-4)Remaining schedule: at Jaguars, at Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, at Texans  Can Daniel Jones rediscover the early-year efficiency that made him a stunning breakout? He'll have to do so against some stingy defenses down the stretch, with almost every one of Indianapolis' remaining opponents boasting a top 10 scoring \"D.\" Accordingly, the Colts are the safest bet to keep slipping in these standings.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (8-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsJosh Allen is still capable of playing Superman, as evidenced in Buffalo's Week 11 win over Tampa Bay. But Sean McDermott's defense has been more volatile. New England may be out of reach atop the AFC East, but the Bills have a relatively clear path to a wild card berth if they can claim two or three of their final five matchups.In the huntThe Texans (7-5) aren't to be written off in the South, with DeMeco Ryans' defense ranking No. 1 in the NFL. The Chiefs (6-6) finally rediscovered their late-game flair against the Colts in Week 12, but Patrick Mahomes' last-gasp heroics weren't enough to mask greater offensive issues on Thanksgiving. The Steelers (6-6) are still alive in the AFC North race despite dropping five of their past seven games.NFC standingsChicago Bears (9-3)Los Angeles Rams (9-3)Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5)Seattle Seahawks (9-3)Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)San Francisco 49ers (9-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Chicago Bears (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Packers, vs. Browns, vs. Packers, at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears, who looked more scrappy than special for a long time, are seemingly proving to the naysayers that they are true contenders after knocking off the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles in convincing fashion. Up next will be the potentially tall task of holding off the NFC North-rival Packers.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Los Angeles Rams (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Cardinals, vs. Lions, at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsMatthew Stafford is slinging it with as much, if not more, confidence than he did in his title-winning Rams debut. But the typically stingy defense was nowhere to be found in a Week 13 upset at the hands of the Panthers. L.A. should still be poised to feast on lesser clubs like Arizona and Atlanta moving forward. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, vs. Raiders, at Commanders, at Bills, vs. Commanders\nThe reigning Super Bowl champions are struggling down the stretch, losing their past two games to the Cowboys and Bears. Vic Fangio's physical defense seems to be wearing down, while the all-star offense isn't getting its typical push up front.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersEvery year, the Bucs scrape their way through the NFC South race, regardless of who's healthy around Baker Mayfield. The remaining schedule suggests a fifth straight division crown is well within reach, although Week 12's blowout loss to the Rams showed the Bucs may not be ready to hang with the heavyweights.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersEven after falling to the rival Rams in Week 11, Seattle should hang around in the race for the NFC West title due to Mike Macdonald's physical defense. That unit was on full display in a Week 13 shutout win over the Vikings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, at Broncos, at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsMatt LaFleur's offense has been more scattershot than usual over the course of the year, but the NFC North is still up for grabs with three divisional matchups still on tap. And the Pack took care of business on Thanksgiving with a showcase by Jordan Love and Micah Parsons, who could make Green Bay a sneakily scary contender.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Titans, at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksBrock Purdy has been up and down since his return from a lingering injury. Regardless, all year, the 49ers have hung around, and now their defense should get some more confidence-boosting matchups after impressive showings against both Carolina and Cleveland, including in Sunday's rout of the Browns.\nIn the huntThe Lions (7-5) aren't the juggernaut they were a year ago at this time, with Dan Campbell's signature fourth-down gambles coming up short, but their young playmakers should keep them in the fight until the end. The Cowboys (6-5-1) are still finding their defensive footing, but Dak Prescott is playing lights out at quarterback, wheeling and dealing with George Pickens at his disposal. The Panthers (7-6) remain in thick of the NFC South race with Sunday's upset win over the Rams. They are just a half game back of the Bucs, who they face two times down the stretch. \n            ",

After the news broke, Meyer posted his seal of approval on social media.Meyer praised Sumrall for his ability to win everywhere he's been. In four seasons, split evenly between Troy and Tulane, Sumrall has compiled a career record of 42-11 with two Sun Belt Conference championships. He can add an American Conference title to his resume this weekend.\"What a special day for Gator Nation,\" Meyer said. \"Welcome head football coach Jon Sumrall, one of the top five coaches in winning percentage in college football. I've studied coach Sumrall. I got to spend some time with him over the last few months. His teams are tough, they're physical and he creates a competitive environment. If he wins the conference championship this year, it'll be the third conference championship over the past four years.\"\nMeyer knows what it takes to win in Gainesville. He put together a 65-15 record at Florida, which included two SEC championships and two national championships. Throughout his 17-year coaching career at the college level, Meyer went 187-32 with seven conference championships and three national titles.Since Meyer stepped down at Florida following the 2010 season, the Gators have struggled to regain their status as national championship contenders. Florida hasn't won more than eight games since 2019, and Sumrall will be the program's fifth coach since Meyer's departure.\nOne of the team's biggest issues in recent years has been the lack of explosiveness on offense, a staple of Florida football under coaches like Meyer and Steve Spurrier. In his first statement as the Gators' next head coach, Sumrall said it's \"mandatory\" for the program to have a high-powered offense.\n            \n    ",

Coach Kevin Stefanski declined to comment on whether he locked up the role for good or if he remains in a week-to-week competition with Dillon Gabriel.The announcement came after an ESPN report stated the Browns are open to giving Sanders an \"extended look\" in the starting job. They previously gave Gabriel a six-game opportunity, but after he suffered a concussion in the last of those starts, he ceded the job to his fellow rookie.Sanders made his second career start in the loss to the 49ers and completed 16 of 25 passes for 149 yards and a touchdown. He also ran once for a 6-yard gain.\"He's battling like all of our guys are battling,\" Stefanski said of Sanders. \"I know there's plays he wants back, but we'll look at it and we'll correct it.\"\nAlthough it came in a losing effort, Sanders at times looked more comfortable running the offense than in his previous two outings. He was more accurate than in his starting debut against the Las Vegas Raiders when he went just 11 for 20, and he was dramatically more effective than his 4-for-16 relief appearance against the Baltimore Ravens.\"Obviously we lost, so I ain't play well,\" Sanders said. \"It's definitely things on film I'm gonna look back and want to get back and want to see, but at least moving forward I know what we could do differently going about the week and being able to get fully prepared for every possibility.\"Sanders, Cam Ward set for rookie duelIt will be a rookie-versus-rookie battle next week when the Browns host the Titans' No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward. Tennessee (1-11)  heads to Cleveland (3-9) on the heels of another blowout loss, this time a 25-3 defeat at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nSanders and Ward were often compared in the pre-draft process as first-round prospects. Ward lived up to expectations when he came off the board at No. 1, but Sanders experienced one of the most dramatic draft slides in recent memory when he slipped all the way to the fifth round. Neither found much success in the early going of their NFL careers.PlayerComp-AttYardsTDINTShedeur Sanders31-61 (50.1%)40522Cam Ward246-412 (59.7%)2,35176One of the quarterbacks will earn his second win of the year. A victory would give Sanders a winning record as a starter, while Ward is already in a much deeper hole with his larger sample size of 12 starts. If Sanders improves to 2-1 in his role, he could strengthen his grip on the job and distance himself from Gabriel, who logged just one win in his six opportunities atop the depth chart.\"In the midst of everything that's going on -- wins, losses, anything -- I remember when I wasn't playing,\" Sanders said. \"So I never forget that feeling. I try my best to not let that happen again, for me to be in that position.\"\n            ",

There weren't many highlights from this matchup, as both teams did not cross 254 yards of total offense, but there were some fireworks after the final whistle. When Browns defensive lineman Maliek Collins went down with an injury in the third quarter and was carted off the field, 49ers wide receiver Jauan Jennings apparently took the opportunity to talk some trash. At least, that's what Browns defensive lineman Shelby Harris said. And he wants the world to know that Jennings \"Is a hoe.\" \"He's a hoe, and I want that known,\" Harris told reporters in the locker room. \"Like I see why he got punched in the nuts, because he said some things that you should not say to another man, ever. But, like, I don't respect it because you say that then run behind your O-line. That's some real soft shit, and I want that known. I see exactly why they punched him in the nuts, I'm surprised nobody punched him in the jaw yet.\"\nIf you recall, Jennings was punched below the belt by Carolina Panthers defensive back Tre'von Moehrig last Monday night. After the game, Jennings chased Moehrig down and struck him across the face. Moehrig was suspended one game without pay for his low blow. \nBrowns superstar Myles Garrett also addressed the Jennings matter during his postgame press conference, saying, \"I can't speak for how he was raised.\" His take on the issue was much more measured. \"He had a lot to say that was demeaning and disparaging towards some of our players,\" Garrett said.\nJennings caught four passes for 39 yards and a touchdown during Sunday's victory. He also apparently made a few enemies as well. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Max Brosmer made the wrong type of history in his first NFL start, and the Vikings offense officially hit rock bottom. With its undrafted rookie quarterback leading the way, Minnesota lost 26-0 at the Seahawks. It's the first time the Vikings have been shut out since Nov. 11, 2007, ending a 294-game streak with at least one point. Entering Sunday, it had been the third-longest active scoring streak in the NFL.Longest active NFL scoring streaks entering SundayGamesRavens382Steelers308Vikings294<<49ers246>> Ended SundayBrosmer, starting because Week 1 starter J.J. McCarthy (concussion) was ruled out and backup Carson Wentz (shoulder) is done for the season, finished 19 for 30 for 126 yards and four interceptions. He also took four sacks. His 32.8 passer rating was the worst by any starter this season and the worst by a Vikings starter in a game since Spergon Wynn in 2001. For reference, throwing an incompletion on every pass carries a passer rating of 39.6The situation -- an undrafted rookie facing one of the league's best defenses on the road in his first start -- had all the makings for a disaster, and it ended up being even worseMinnesota punted on each of its first four drives but trailed just 3-0 in the second quarter when Dallas Turner strip-sacked Sam Darnold and Jalen Redmond recovered. That put Brosmer and the offense in business at Seattle's 22-yard line, in seemingly sure scoring distance. Instead, Brosmer threw a fourth-and-1 interception to Ernest Jones IV, who went 84 yards the other way for a touchdown.\nBy the end of the half, Minnesota trailed 13-0 and had just three first downs.\nIt got worse in the second half. The Vikings worked their way into the edge of field goal range when Aaron Jones Sr. lost a fumble and got injured in the process. On their next possession, the Vikings again got into Seattle territory, but Brosmer threw high for Jalen Nailor, and Coby Bryant picked it off.\nBrosmer threw another interception to Jones and then a fourth interception, this time to Riq Woolen. Woolen lost a fumble on the return, though, giving Minnesota yet another short field. Again, the Vikings failed to cash in, beset by a holding penalty and a pair of Brosmer sacks, including one on fourth downThat sequence sealed Minnesota's first time failing to score a point in a game since a 34-0 loss to the Packers more than 18 years ago. That game similarly included a third-string quarterback starting; with both Tavaris Jackson and Kelly Holcomb hurt, Brooks Bollinger got the call. Bollinger had more succes than Brosmer -- 16 for 26 for 176 yards and just one interception -- but was unable to generate any points.\nThe Vikings face the Commanders in Week 14.\n            ",

Once 3-5-1, Dallas has strung together three straight wins thanks to a defensive turnaround, and now, more defensive help is on the way. On Sunday, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer told reporters that the team has designated cornerback Trevon Diggs to return from injured reserve, and opened his 21-day practice window. Diggs has missed the past six games after he was placed on injured reserve following an accident in his home that landed him in the concussion protocol. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones referred to it as a \"fluke situation.\"\"I don't know the combination of the injury and how it impacted, regarding concussion issue, I'm not sure that I know the detail of how that happened,\" Jones said last month. \"He said what happened, and I'm not saying that didn't happen, but a lot of times, you're not the best viewer of what happened to you. … Yeah, no I won't get into that [what Diggs said happened], but the bottom line is that I do expect him back.\"\nIn six games played this season, Diggs recorded 18 combined tackles with zero passes defensed or interceptions. Diggs is a two-time Pro Bowl player, and was named a First Team All-Pro in 2021 when he led the league in interceptions with 11.The Cowboys are off this weekend after defeating Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Thanksgiving, 31-28. With that win, the Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to defeat both of the previous year's Super Bowl teams in a five-day span. In Week 12, the Cowboys overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. \nEntering NFL Sunday, the Cowboys are the No. 9 seed in the NFC, one spot above the 6-6 Carolina Panthers, and one behind the 7-5 Detroit Lions. Dallas is also 1.5 games back of the 8-4 Eagles in the NFC East, who lost to the Chicago Bears Friday. Up next for the Cowboys are the Lions in Detroit this Thursday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Six starts in, and J.J. McCarthy's learning curve hasn't just been steep -- it's forcing the Vikings to confront the very real possibility that they've tied their future to the wrong quarterback.Ten months ago, Kevin O'Connell was named AP NFL Coach of the Year after the Vikings won 14 regular-season games with one-time castoff Sam Darnold. The team decided to let Darnold walk and put the offense in the unproven hands of McCarthy, the 2024 first-round pick. McCarthy missed his rookie season with a knee injury and has made just six starts in 2025 after missing time with a high ankle sprain and, most recently, a concussion suffered in a Week 12 loss to the Packers. It was Minnesota's third straight defeat, and yet more evidence that McCarthy isn't close to being a franchise quarterback. Darnold, meanwhile, signed a three-year, $105 million deal in Seattle and has the Seahawks at 9-3 after a decisive Week 13 win over ... Minnesota -- a game during which the Vikings were forced to start undrafted rookie Max Brosmer with McCarthy still in concussion protocol. \n\n        \n            \n                Vikings' 294-game scoring streak comes to an end in 26-0 loss to Seahawks\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's not surprising that McCarthy has struggled; most young quarterbacks do. In the NFL, the windows are tighter, the pockets are smaller and tougher to navigate, and the game is much faster. What has been alarming, however, is that McCarthy appears to regress each week. He's battling accuracy issues, doesn't play on time and often runs himself into pressures and sacks. While O'Connell and star wide receiver Justin Jefferson have said all the right things publicly, their body language tells a different story during games. And soon, O'Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah will have to decide: Can the 22-year-old quarterback, six starts into his NFL career, be fixed, or is it already time to hit the reset button and move on?\nThe complication: O'Connell's words before the season.\"I've thought a lot about this,\" O'Connell told The Athletic back in early September. \"And I've realized the most important part of a quarterback's development is when it doesn't go right. When there are growing pains, when there are struggles, that's when you have to buckle up and put on your big-boy pants as a coach. You have to have a clear-cut plan on how you're going to improve: what film to watch, what drills to do, how to measure progress, even if it's really small.\"It's our job as coaches to look inward first and exhaust every resource possible to get these guys to play like the best versions of themselves.\"O'Connell isn't wrong. Too often, organizations give up on quarterbacks too soon, and they own much of the blame. None of that changes the fact that McCarthy has been historically bad to start his career. In fact, the numbers are somehow even more damning than the eye test.\nThe numbers confirm the nightmare\nEye test aside, the data is even harsher -- and it puts McCarthy in a category reserved for the NFL's biggest quarterback misfires.Stacked against every first-round QB since 2016 who saw consistent playing time in their first two seasons, McCarthy's first six starts paint a stark picture. He ranks 34th out of 35 QBs in EPA per dropback (-0.34), 32nd in completion percentage (54.2%),  34th in turnover-worthy throws (7.5%), and dead last in interceptions (10) and passer rating (57.9). (In its simplest form, EPA per dropback is the average number of points a quarterback creates [or loses] for his team every time he drops back.)\nRKNAMEEPA/DB games: 1-6EPA/DB games: 7-17CHANGE1Patrick Mahomes0.340.31-0.032Jayden Daniels0.280.08-0.203Deshaun Watson0.250.09-0.164Justin Herbert0.170.11-0.065C.J.

He's basically creating his own sacks. The protection is good; the decision-making isn't. \n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: Did the Vikings miscalculate their quarterback decisions by going all in on J.J. McCarthy?\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe outlier: The QB who survived a historically poor startIf you're looking for a glimmer of hope in the table above, Jared Goff might be it. He is the only quarterback in the past 10 drafts to get off to a slower start over his first six games than McCarthy, according to EPA per dropback. And like McCarthy, Goff struggled with completion percentage (53.5%), interceptions (seven) and passer rating (61.7). To understand how first-round quarterbacks overcome early struggles, I compared their first six NFL starts to their next 11 -- which works out to a full 17-game season.Goff didn't truly become \"Jared Goff, one of the NFL's best quarterbacks,\" until his 2021 breakout in Detroit, his sixth year in the league. But even in starts 7–17, he showed significant progress compared to his rocky first six outings.Across those next 11 starts, Goff posted the largest EPA per dropback improvement of any of the 35 quarterbacks studied -- nearly a half-point jump. Only Lamar Jackson (+0.35), Bo Nix (+0.33), and Baker Mayfield (+0.24) were even close. His completion percentage climbed from 53.5% to 61.5%, his TD-INT ratio improved from 5–7 to 16–4, and his passer rating skyrocketed from 61.7 to 97.9.The McVay Factor: Improvement by designGoff deserves credit for the quick improvement, but Sean McVay's contribution was arguably more important. (Goff's first seven starts came during his rookie season with head coach Jeff Fisher; starts 8-17 came in Year 2 with McVay, when the Rams went 11-5 and Goff made the Pro Bowl.)  Essentially, McVay made it a priority to simplify the offense for Goff, never giving him more than he could handle. In fact, the first-year coach would err on the side of being too conservative over putting too much on the second-year quarterback's plate.If this sounds familiar it's because it's the same strategy Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has used for young quarterbacks -- most recently, Drake Maye, the No. 3 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. (He went seven spots ahead of McCarthy.)\"I always talk about it ... you guys all had a bucket,\" McDaniels told Julian Edelman last offseason. \"And yours was a big bucket at the end like you could handle whatever we gave you. Well, when you take a young quarterback, it's more like a cup. ...\"And when it gets to the top you got to stop ... and then make sure that he has this and he can do it well. And then, okay, so then when he's ready for more, then you get him a bigger cup, and then hopefully he ends up with a bucket. But there's no shortcut. There's no shortcut to it. And I think knowing where the player's at is really important.\"The question for the Vikings is a simple one: Can O'Connell do for McCarthy what McVay did for Goff? Or what Sean Payton has done for Nix? Or can McCarthy find the confidence that has made Mayfield so successful? Or is there a scheme that better fits McCarthy's skillset, much like the Ravens and Greg Roman did for Jackson early in his Ravens career? Most QBs in this hole never climb outThe answers to all these questions, based on what we've seen through six games from McCarthy, are not encouraging -- not even a little bit. Goff is the only modern quarterback who climbed out of a hole deeper than McCarthy's. Everyone else in this range -- from Zach Wilson to Justin Fields to Paxton Lynch -- stayed stuck.Even Darnold, who won 14 games a season ago, and Daniel Jones, who spent the final six weeks of 2024 with the Vikings, had much better starts to their careers.Starts 1-6EPA/DBCOMPATTCOMP%TDINTPASS RTDarnold-0.0610717959.80%9783.7Jones-0.0513221262.30%10784.4Neither quarterback improved over their next 11 starts -- but they didn't get worse, either. And sometimes just navigating your way through the growing pains of a full NFL season is reason enough to remain hopeful about a young quarterback's prospects for success. And even then -- and as O'Connell made clear in his comments before the season – you have to be patient enough to let that quarterback develop. Sometimes that happens immediately (see Jayden Daniels, who balled out as a rookie but has struggled to stay healthy in 2025), sometimes it all comes together in Year 2 (Drake Maye is a legit MVP candidate), sometimes it takes several years and several teams for it to all come together (Mayfield, Darnold, Goff). And more often than not, it never works. Starts 7-17EPA/DBCOMPATTCOMP%TDINTPASS RTDarnold-0.0821537058.10%131670.5Jones-0.0726042561.20%161082.0So, yes, it's easy now to say that the Vikings made a huge mistake letting Darnold or Jones leave. But Darnold, the third-overall pick in 2018, didn't turn into one of the league's most efficient quarterbacks until his fourth team and seventh NFL season. Jones, the sixth-overall pick in 2019, flashed in his fourth season (Brian Daboll's first in New York), but it took another two years and two teams for him to reincarnate himself as \"Indiana Jones\" with the Colts. Let's revisit the first table above and again look at those QBs with the lowest EPA per dropback over their first six starts.Of the 12 names – all drafted between 2016 and 2025 – only four are with their original teams. All four were drafted in 2023 or later and are still on their rookie deals. (Bryce Young, Bo Nix, J.J. McCarthy and Cam Ward, and Young was benched two weeks into his second season before regaining the job several weeks later, and he's remained the starter ever since) The seven others not named Goff? Mayfield lasted four seasons in Cleveland; Fields and Wilson lasted three seasons in Chicago and New York; Pickett and Lynch lasted two seasons in Pittsburgh and Denver; Haskins (who passed away in April 2022), didn't last two full seasons in Washington; and Rosen lasted exactly one season in Arizona.\"I believe organizations fail young quarterbacks before young quarterbacks fail organizations,\" O'Connell said last fall on \"The Rich Eisen Show.\"There is a lot of truth to O'Connell's words -- and patience can save a young quarterback. But it can also sink a franchise. The Vikings have to decide which future they're willing to bet on.\n            ",

Las Vegas favored Matthew Stafford and company by double digits over the 6-6 Carolina Panthers, but the \"Cardiac Cats\" shocked the NFL world by registering one of the biggest upsets of the year.Bryce Young threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns, while the Panthers defense forced three turnovers to earn a 31-28 upset victory. The Panthers recorded the two biggest upsets of the 2025 season, as they also defeated the Green Bay Packers as a 13-point underdog in Week 9. This shocking result delivers massive ramifications within the NFL playoff picture, including pushing the Rams out of the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The new top dog in the conference with a direct path at clinching a first-round bye? The Chicago Bears.Chicago moved to 9-3 with a 24-15 upset win Friday over the Philadelphia Eagles. Ben Johnson's rushing attack was the difference, as Kyle Monangai rushed 22 times for 130 yards and one touchdown, while D'Andre Swift rushed 18 times for 125 yards and a touchdown. They became the first teammates to rush for 125 yards and a touchdown in a game since Colin Kaepernick and Frank Gore accomplished the feat in 2014. \nThis is the first time the Bears started 9-3 since 2010. They may be the true sleeper in this topsy-turvy season, as the Bears reached the NFC Championship game the last two times they started 9-3. Quarterback Caleb Williams' play improved, as well. He averages more passing yards per game in his second NFL season, a higher yards per attempt and passer rating as well. The former No. 1 overall pick has thrown eight touchdowns compared to one interception over the past five games. The biggest reason for the Bears' success in 2025 has been the play of the defense. Entering Sunday, Dennis Allen's unit led the NFL in takeaways with 26, and turnover differential with +17. The Bears have three different players that rank inside the top four for interceptions! Kevin Byard leads the NFL with six picks, while Nahshon Wright has registered five interceptions and Tremaine Edmunds is tied with two other players with four interceptions.\nAccording to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh, the Bears have a 43.5% chance to hold onto their lead in the NFC North, an 84.5% chance to make the playoffs, a 6.8% chance to win the NFC and a 2.8% chance to win the Super Bowl. Earning the No. 1 seed and the first-round playoff bye would certainly help Chicago's Super Bowl dreams.Bears' remaining scheduleWeekOpponent14at Green Bay Packers15vs. Cleveland Browns16vs. Green Bay Packers17at San Francisco 49ers18vs. Detroit Lions\n            \n    ",

Normally, the Sunday after the college football regular season concludes brings with it a plethora of firings. But with a majority of the firings coming throughout various points across the season, this year prominent schools are setting the college football world on fire with notable hiring announcements. Then, of course, there's the Lane Kiffin saga, which saw the Ole Miss coach leave a team bound for the College Football Playoff to take over at LSU after the Tigers fired Brian Kelly during the season. \nIt's turned into one of the craziest college football coaching carousel cycles we have seen in recent memory, and CBS Sports is tracking every move in the 2025-26 cycle and grading each hire below.

One day after the season concluded, Kiffin chose LSU, leaving the playoff-bound Rebels searching for a coach. Ole Miss quickly responded by hiring Golding, a former Nick Saban assistant who has led the Rebels' defense since 2023. Golding should help stabilize a program that could find itself on shaky ground as Kiffin moves to poach assistants and potentially players for his new operation in Baton Rouge.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mark CarneyKenni BurnsKent State fired Kenni Burns         in April for violations of his contract that included use of his personal card for expenses.

However, Rodgers briefly left Sunday's eventual 26-7 loss following the first play from scrimmage in the second half after taking a violent hit.Rodgers was sacked from behind by Joey Bosa, and fumbled the ball. It was picked up by Bills cornerback Christian Benford who returned it 17 yards for Buffalo's first touchdown of the game. Rodgers was seen cradling his injured wrist on the ground, and also sustained a cut on his nose, which drew blood.Check out what happened, here:\nRodgers was replaced by Mason Rudolph for one series, who threw an interception to Benford. That turnover led to another Bills touchdown, which extended Buffalo's lead to nine points.The sack-fumble of Rodgers was truly the turning point of this game. The Steelers led the Bills at halftime, 7-3, but the Bosa hit on Rodgers sparked a 23-0 run the Bills ended on.\nRodgers completed 10 of 21 passes for 117 yards in his return to the field. This loss knocks the Steelers down to 6-6, and half a game back of the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North. The two rivals face off in Baltimore next Sunday. \n            \n    ",

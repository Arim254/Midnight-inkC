    "body": "\nThe 2025-26 NBA season officially tips off on Tuesday, at 7:30 p.m. ET with a doubleheader featuring Rockets vs. Thunder and Lakers vs. Warriors, leaving Fantasy basketball managers just a few hours to finalize their 2025 fantasy basketball draft strategy. According to the latest Fantasy basketball rankings from SportsLine, Nikola Jokić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Victor Wembanyama are the consensus top picks heading into the new season. Several teams will have new looks this season, which will also have an effect on the fantasy production for multiple players.Players like Kevin Durant, Jordan Poole, Cam Johnson, Myles Turner and Michael Porter Jr. all landed with new teams during the offseason. Can they continue to produce at levels that will land them near the top of the fantasy basketball rankings? Or should they be listed among the potential fantasy basketball busts for this season? Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings.   Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Milwaukee Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. In his final 30 regular-season games with the Bucks last season, he shot 40.8% from three while averaging 11.7 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists in just under 20 minutes per game -- a dramatic improvement from the 24.5% 3-point mark he posted in Los Angeles. During the final stretch of the season without Damian Lillard, Porter elevated his play even more, averaging 14.3 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game on efficient shooting.In the 2025 postseason, Porter continued his hot streak, connecting on 46.7% of his 3-pointers while averaging 11.2 points, 5.4 assists and 3.6 rebounds across five games. For his career, he has averaged 13.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.6 assists, shooting 43.5% from the field and 35.1% from beyond the arc. Now projected to start at point guard for Milwaukee, Porter is one of only two players on the Bucks' 2025-26 roster to average at least 2.9 assists per game last season. Following his late-season surge and expanded role, he's expected to outperform his 2025 Fantasy basketball ADP of 72, with the potential to become a breakout contributor in both real and fantasy terms. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier, who has an ADP of No. 137 overall. The former No. 1 overall recruit was the penultimate pick in the first round of last year's draft and began his rookie year as a reserve. He quickly ascended to the starting point guard position and upped his scoring average over each of the last four months of the season. He also averaged 6.3 assists for the season, which was 16th in the NBA as he was the only first-year player to rank in the top 50 in assists.Coming off a franchise-worst 65-loss season, Utah is clearly in its rebuilding phase, and Collier is one of the cornerstones of that effort. Thus, he will be given lots of court time to establish himself as, potentially, Utah's point guard of both the present and the future. Add in that he plays for a Jazz team which loves to get up and down the court -- ranking fifth in pace last year -- and Collier is poised to pile up stats and make a name for himself this season. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. At just 26 years old, Poole was a key piece in a blockbuster Wizards-Pelicans trade this offseason, landing in New Orleans in exchange for CJ McCollum, Kelly Olynyk, and future picks. ast season in Washington, Poole averaged a career-best 20.5 points, 4.5 assists, and 3.0 rebounds across 68 games while shooting 43.2% from the field and 37.8% from three.Poole's usage rate ranked among the top 20 guards in the league last season, yet his efficiency metrics -- including a 52.6 true shooting percentage -- were below league average. With New Orleans adding lottery picks Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears, as well as emphasizing ball movement and defense under head coach Willie Green, Poole's scoring volume could decline as the season progresses. He's currently being drafted in the seventh round of most Fantasy leagues, but the model suggests that veteran guards like Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickley, both typically selected later, project as better overall values in standard formats. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well. How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts.

Veteran Carson Wentz has played well, but the results have largely been the same for a 3-3 Vikings team that has alternated wins and losses each week. Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell announced Tuesday that Wentz will make his fourth consecutive start for Thursday night's road game against the Los Angeles Chargers. O'Connell added that McCarthy isn't quite ready to go after putting him through an on-field workout earlier in the day. McCarthy will serve as the team's emergency No. 3 quarterback on Thursday, behind Wentz and backup Max Brosmer. Minnesota has split its four games this season with Wentz under center. The 33-year-old has completed 66.9% of his passes this season with five touchdowns and four interceptions. \n\n        \n            \n                Did the Vikings botch their QB situation?

Wentz threw for 313 yards but completed a season-low 61.9% of his passes. \nO'Connell also announced Tuesday that the team was opening up the 21-day practice window for running back Aaron Jones while leaving the door open for him to possible play on Thursday night. A former Pro Bowler, Jones hasn't played since sustaining a hamstring injury during Minnesota's Week 2 loss to the Falcons. \nJones' return could help Wentz as he prepares to face a Chargers defense that is currently eighth in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed and ninth in touchdown passes permitted. \n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        Before Fred VanVleet tore his ACL in September, the big storyline was straightforward: The Houston Rockets are going for it. In the offseason",
    "body": "\n        Before Fred VanVleet tore his ACL in September, the big storyline was straightforward: The Houston Rockets are going for it. In the offseason, they traded for Kevin Durant, addressing their biggest weakness (halfcourt scoring) in the simplest, splashiest way possible. With the addition of Dorian Finney-Smith and some improvement from burgeoning stars Amen Thompson and Alperen Sengun, they had a shot to compete for a championship.Is that still the case without VanVleet? Maybe not. The Rockets were significantly worse on both ends when he was off the court last season, and this year's roster has much more depth in the frontcourt than the backcourt. There is still tons of talent here, though, with a fair amount of versatility and overwhelming size and length. \"Sometimes it's going to be doubling down on bully ball,\" coach Ime Udoka said on media day. \"If Amen [is] out there with two bigs and Jabari [Smith Jr.] and KD on the court, we're probably one of the biggest teams in the history of the league.\" They're going to start that humongous lineup in the opener on Tuesday night in OKC.Thompson has a lot on his shoulders. Second-year guard Reed Sheppard, too. Time to see how much they can handle.The State of PlayLast year: The Rockets went 52-30, with a top-five defense and a slightly above-average offense. Sengun made his first All-Star Game and Udoka took the league by surprise by playing him next to Steven Adams in the second half of the season. In 162 minutes spread over 22 regular-season games, the jumbo Rockets crushed everything in sight, rebounding more than half of their own misses and more than 80% of their opponents'. They won those double-big minutes by 29.9 points per 100 possessions, but, while the look remained effective in their seven-game series against the Warriors, they ultimately couldn't score enough to advance.\nThe offseason: To get Durant, the Rockets sent Dillon Brooks, Jalen Green, the No. 10 pick in the 2025 draft and five second-round picks to Phoenix. Months later, they signed Durant to a two-year, $90 million extension with a player option in 2027-28. They also signed Smith to an extension (five years, $122 million) and brought back Adams (three years, $39 million), VanVleet (two years, $50 million, player option), Aaron Holiday (one year, minimum), Jae'Sean Tate (one year, minimum) and Jeff Green (one year, minimum). In free agency, they added Finney-Smith (4 years, $52.7 million, player option), Clint Capela (3 years, $21.1 million) and Josh Okogie (one year, minimum). Cam Whitmore went to Washington in a trade (for two second-round picks and the rights to Mojave King), Jock Landale signed with Memphis (after Houston waived him) and Jack McVeigh signed with the Cairns Taipans of the NBL.Las Vegas over/under: 52.5 wins, per FanDuel SportsbookThe conversationRockets believer: Hello, Year 3 Amen Thompson:\nI am so ready for this. He is so ready for this. Did you notice he made 11 of his 12 free throws in the preseason? Thompson should have won Defensive Player of the Year last year, and he's about to be a star on the offensive side, too. If you weren't all-in on the Rockets after what Alperen Sengun did in Eurobasket, you should be now. I hate that Fred VanVleet is out for the year, but this is absolutely still a championship contender. \nRockets skeptic: I have to be all-in because Thompson cooked … Jordan Poole? In a preseason game? I don't know, man. I've noticed the hype machine going into overdrive with Thompson and I'm not super comfortable with it. He makes a lot more sense to me as a secondary playmaker than as the guy who's going to have the ball in his hands at the beginning of every possession. If Houston is going to overcome this devastating VanVleet injury, it either needs Reed Sheppard to grow up fast or it needs to make a midseason trade. (Evan Mobley was the rightful DPOY winner, by the way.)\nRockets believer: Hogwash! If the Rockets make a trade at some point, it'll be to bolster what is already a special team, not to plug a hole at point guard. Thompson can do this, and I'm fully confident in Sheppard, too. The only question is whether or not Ime Udoka is going to start them together. I love the fit long-term, but I'd understand keeping Thompson at the 1, trying to make the starters the best defensive unit in the league and letting Sheppard make a run at the Sixth Man of the Year award.Rockets skeptic: I have no idea if Sheppard is ready to start for a good team -- he barely played as a rookie! -- but I know I don't like the enormous lineup that Udoka started against the Pelicans in the preseason and is going to start again on opening night. Kevin Durant is 37, and you want him playing at the 2? You want Jabari Smith Jr. at the 3? I was surprised that Sengun and Steven Adams worked so well together last season, but, if you keep trying to get bigger, there are going to be diminishing returns. Rockets believer: Uh, why? Think outside the box! The Rockets are going to demolish teams on the boards again, and it's not like they're going to be short on shooting. Durant is here. Dorian Finney-Smith is here. Sheppard is actually going to play. Smith is back. Tari Eason is a decent enough shooter, too, and Sengun is going to take (and make) more 3s this season. I love that this team is big, and I love that the front office saw an opportunity to grab another big (Clint Capela) and took advantage of it. This way, even if there's an injury to one of the bigs, Houston can still play bully ball.\nRockets skeptic: Would you rather have Capela on this team than, say, Ty Jerome? What about Tyus Jones or De'Anthony Melton? It feels like Houston was trying to make sure Sheppard would get a chance to play, but this backfired when VanVleet got hurt. Now it's left with an imbalanced roster and a shortage of playmaking. I'm sorry, but I'm definitely concerned about the shooting if Thompson, Sengun and Adams are going to continue to play together, and I'm concerned that opposing teams are going to try to run the super-sized lineups to death. This should still be a playoff team, but, without VanVleet, that's as far as I'm willing to go.\n            ",

At least nine teams will be changing full-time skippers heading into 2026, including the San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, Atlanta Braves and Baltimore Orioles.The Los Angeles Angels, who let go of both Ron Washington and interim Ray Montgomery, are reportedly hiring former player Kurt Suzuki as their new skipper. Suzuki spent parts of 16 years in the majors, including his last two with the Angels, and won a World Series ring with the Washington Nationals in 2019.The Texas Rangers became Major League Baseball's first team to complete a managerial change earlier in the month, officially announcing that Skip Schumaker will take over in the dugout. Texas had previously announced a parting of ways with Bruce Bochy, the future Hall of Fame skipper who guided the franchise to its first (and to date only) World Series title in 2023.While there is going to be an unusually large amount of turnover, you shouldn't fret.

    "body": "\n        In the Memphis Grizzlies' final preseason game, guard Ty Jerome strained his right calf, an injury that will sideline him for at least four weeks. The next day, the Grizzlies announced that guard Scotty Pippen Jr. needed surgery on his left big toe and ESPN reported that he'd be out for at least 12 weeks. Given that Ja Morant had missed the entire preseason because of a sprained left ankle, these developments were at least a little alarming.And that's just the backcourt. In late September, Memphis announced that center Zach Edey was recovering from surgery on his left ankle and could miss the first two months of the season. At the same time, they announced that big man Brandon Clarke needed to have arthroscopic surgery on his knee and would be reevaluated in six weeks. Jaren Jackson Jr. is back on the court after having surgery on his right foot, but he's going to have to carry a heavy load.All of this is to say that the lead-up to the 2025-26 season has been less than ideal for the Grizzlies. They have some interesting new pieces (Jerome, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cedric Coward), but they lost one of their core players (Desmond Bane) and they don't have a ton of room for error in the West.The State of PlayLast year: On the one hand, the Grizzlies finished with the league's sixth-best net rating and, midway through March, had a 42-24 record. On the other hand, they struggled against elite competition, went on a tailspin late in the season, fired their coach (Taylor Jenkins) with just nine games left, fell into the play-in and got swept by the eventual champs in the first round of the playoffs. Memphis had a fascinating new offense but essentially abandoned it.\nThe offseason: A week after they were eliminated, the Grizzlies took the interim tag away from head coach Tuomas Iisalo. In mid-June, they traded Bane to the Magic for Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony (whom they would later waive), four first-round picks (including the No. 16 pick in the 2025 draft) and a 2029 pick swap. On draft night, they traded up from No. 16 to No. 11, sending the Blazers one of the picks they'd gotten from Orlando and two future seconds. At No. 11, they drafted Coward, a wing whose path to Memphis is inconceivable. At No. 49, they drafted guard Javon Small. In July, they renegotiated and extended Jackson's contract (four years, $205 million, not including the $35 million he'll make this year) and re-signed Santi Aldama (three years, $52.5 million) and Cam Spencer (four years, $10.4 million, team option). Their biggest free-agent addition was Jerome (three years, $27.7 million), but they also signed Jock Landale for the minimum and former No. 23 pick Olivier-Maxence Prosper on a two-way contract. They traded Jay Huff to the Pacers for a 2029 second-round pick and a 2031 second-round swap. Luke Kennard left for the Hawks in free agency.Las Vegas over/under: 39.5 wins, per FanDuel SportsbookThe ConversationGrizzlies believer: Don't make the mistake of overlooking the Grizzlies. I know they lost Desmond Bane and they're banged up right now, but they were a top-three team in the West for most of 2024-25 and finished with 48 wins despite sort of falling apart late in the regular season. I'm not predicting they're about to win the title or anything, but I won't be surprised if they make the playoffs outright. I still think Ja Morant can play at an All-NBA level, and there are a lot of solid players on this roster. Ty Jerome was a Sixth Man of the Year candidate last season, Santi Aldama might be the most underrated player in the whole league and I think Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is going to look much better now that he's no longer the only floor spacer out there. You'll see development from Jaylen Wells and Zach Edey in Year 2, and I think there's a chance that Cedric Coward is a winning player immediately. With Vince Williams Jr., John Konchar and GG Jackson II still in the mix, though, Coward will have a lot of competition on the wing. Grizzlies skeptic: Yeah, the Grizzlies have a lot of guys. But they're mostly just, like, guys. If they were in the East, that would be enough for a playoff spot. In the West, I don't see it, especially with all of these injuries. For years, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke have been their most effective frontcourt duo. Now, I'm guessing Aldama is going to have to be in that Clarke role (and be the lone big in some lineups). Jerome getting hurt right before the season is a gut punch, and losing Scotty Pippen Jr. at the same time is just terrible. When I think about the trajectory Morant was on in 2022-23, I get sad. I wish I could be as bullish on him as you are.\nGrizzlies believer: I'm bullish on Morant, and I'm also bullish on Tuomas Iisalo getting the most out of him. You're still going to see some of the movement patterns the Grizzlies used last year, but there will be much more on-ball and off-ball screens and they're going to use their bigs as hubs. I know Morant isn't coming off his most impressive individual season, but he averaged 27.6 points on 57.1% true shooting after the All-Star break. If you've somehow forgotten what a force he is when he gets downhill, he will remind you.Grizzlies skeptic: Morant is only 26, so I'm not going to write him off. But he averaged a career-high 8.5 3-point attempts per game last year and made just 30.9% of them. More than half of those attempts were pull-ups, and he made just 28.6% of those. He turned the ball over more often than ever before, too. His highlights are still extremely cool, but I think it's fair to be concerned. This is his prime, so, in theory, he should be putting it all together now.Grizzlies believer: Let's revisit the Ja conversation in a month or two. I bet you'll be back on board. I also anticipate that your whole outlook on Memphis will have changed by then. When the Grizzlies' defense slipped and they fired Taylor Jenkins, everybody lost their minds about them to the point that Jackson somehow missed out on All-NBA entirely and was relegated to the All-Defensive Second Team. People are still too down on them, but the pendulum can swing back just as quickly. One five-game winning streak -- or a couple of wins against top-tier teams -- should do the trick.\nGrizzlies skeptic: If last year's Grizzlies couldn't beat top-tier teams, why should anybody expect this iteration to do so? I haven't lost my mind, and those of us predicting that they'll be in the play-in (again) aren't haters. This is a good-but-not-great team in a tough conference, and it has already had terrible injury luck. The front office just traded its player development program's biggest success story because it determined that the core didn't have a high enough ceiling. Now is the time for the whole franchise to recalibrate. I'll be patient as that happens, but I'll keep my expectations reasonable.\n            ",

With each win, their hopes of a conference championship — and potentially a College Football Playoff berth — grow more realistic.Here's how oddsmakers view the six remaining unbeaten teams as threats to win their respective conference titles and where they stand in the national championship picture.TeamConferenceNational Championship oddsConference Championship oddsOhio StateBig Ten13/5-155IndianaBig Ten8-1+190Texas A&MSEC10-1+340Georgia TechACC100-1+230BYUBig 12225-16-1NavyAmerican1000-113/2Odds via FanDuel SportsbookUnsurprisingly, only three of the six -- Ohio State, Indiana and Texas A&M -- are being taken seriously by oddsmakers as national title contenders.\nThe Buckeyes are the favorites to win it all, while Indiana ranks third behind Alabama (13/2). Both are heavy favorites to reach the Big Ten Championship Game, with clear paths toward a potential rematch in Indianapolis. Ohio State's season finale at No. 25 Michigan is the only ranked opponent left on either team's schedule, and both will be double-digit favorites the rest of the way.Texas A&M sits fifth in the national title odds, just behind Oregon (19/2), and trails only Alabama (+125) in the SEC championship race. The Aggies face three more ranked opponents, including road trips to No. 20 LSU and No. 15 Missouri over the next two weeks. If they emerge 9-0, their SEC and national title odds should improve significantly.Georgia Tech, despite a No. 7 ranking, sits well back at 100-1 to win the national title. Still, the Yellow Jackets have the second-shortest odds among ACC teams, behind only Miami (17-1), and are now the betting favorites to win the conference championship. A favorable remaining schedule -- featuring Syracuse, NC State, Boston College and Pitt -- gives them a legitimate chance to reach Charlotte unbeaten.BYU hasn't earned the same respect in the Big 12. The Cougars are listed at 225-1 to win the national title, third among Big 12 teams behind Texas Tech (27-1) and Arizona State (200-1). They also trail those two in Big 12 title odds, with the Red Raiders still the slight favorite (-105) despite last week's loss to Arizona State. BYU's remaining road games at No. 14 Texas Tech and No. 21 Cincinnati loom large, and oddsmakers expect the Cougars to stumble at least once or twice down the stretch.\nThen there's Navy, the lone unbeaten Group of Five team at 6-0. The Midshipmen are long shots at 1,000-1 to win the national title and rank fourth in American Conference title odds behind USF (+130), Tulane (+350) and North Texas (+450). The second half of the season will be challenging, with games against FAU, North Texas, No. 12 Notre Dame, USF, Memphis and Army. Navy is projected to lose at least three of those contests, but a late-season run could make things interesting in the American title race.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The year is 1970, and the NFL and AFL have merged into one league. The 10 AFL teams have come over to the NFL and, joined by the NFL's Colts, Browns and Steelers, formed the 13-team AFC. The NFC is composed of the 13 previous NFL teams not named the Colts, Browns or Steelers. It's a union several years in the making, one that paves the way for the NFL to become the behemoth it is today.The NFC dominates the first year of play, going 27-12-1 in interconference games, good for a .692 winning percentage. And while an AFC team wins the Super Bowl, it's the Colts, a former NFL team.Fast-forward 55 years, and the NFC is 25-13 against the AFC this season, good for a .658 winning percentage. That would be the best by the conference since that aforementioned 1970 campaign. Week 7 was a good example:The Rams beat the Jaguars 35-0.The Panthers beat the Jets 13-6.The Seahawks beat the Texans 27-19.The Broncos did manage a record-setting comeback to beat the Giants 33-32, but the NFC's 3-1 interconference record was indicative of the season as a whole.\nHere's why the conferences are so imbalanced, why there's a chance for things to change, and how it might impact things going forward.Bottom falling out for AFC teamsThere are bad teams in both conferences, but the league's true bottom feeders are mostly found in the AFC. The 0-7 Jets are the only winless team in the NFL. The 1-6 Titans have already fired their coach. The 1-6 Dolphins might be on their way. The 1-5 Ravens have been the biggest and most shocking disappointment not just this year but in recent memory after entering the year as Super Bowl favorites. The 2-5 Browns and the 2-5 Raiders are rebuilding and have major quarterback questions.If the season were to end today, the AFC would have six of the top seven draft slots, per Tankathon.\nJets (0-7)Dolphins (1-6)Saints (1-6)Titans (1-6)Ravens (1-5)Browns (2-5)Raiders (2-5)Those six teams are a combined 2-10 against NFC teams.Per the CBS Sports research deprtment, a conference has only had six of the top seven draft slots (before trades and other movement) once since the merger. The AFC did it last year, too. The bottom feeders are, mostly, still bottom feeding.In addition to the Ravens, the AFC also houses two of the league's other most disappointing teams in the 2-4 Texans and the 3-4 Bengals. And even the league's most pleasant surprise, the 6-1 Colts, owe their one loss to an NFC team, the Rams.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 Power Rankings: Colts made me eat my words (with hot sauce) as they soar to No. 1\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nImpact on playoff racesFans of NFC teams will be frustrated to see this chart:Playoff   Standings -- Top 12AFCNFC1. Colts6-11. Packers4-1-12. Patriots5-22. 49ers5-23. Broncos5-23. Eagles5-24. Steelers4-24. Buccaneers5-25. Bills4-25. Lions5-26. Chargers4-36. Seahawks5-27. Jaguars4-37. Rams5-28. Chiefs4-38. Bears4-39. Bengals3-49. Panthers4-310. Texans2-410. Cowboys3-3-111. Raiders2-511. Falcons3-312. Browns2-512. Vikings3-3Yes, that's the NFC with 12 teams at .500 or better, compared to just eight for the AFC. SportsLine still gives the 2-4 Texans a 34% chance to make the playoffs but gives the 4-3 Panthers a 9% chance, the 3-3-1 Cowboys a 28% chance, the 3-3 Falcons a 14% chance and the 3-3 Vikings a 17% chance.\nA big part of that, of course, is that NFC teams play other NFC teams more often, creating tough finishes. Per Tankathon, nine of the 10 hardest remaining schedules belong to NFC teams.It isn't always this wayThe pendulum of conference power tends to swing. That was true early on, and it's true now. Remember that 1970 season? Well, the rest of the decade belonged almost exclusively to the AFC, led by the Steelers' dynasty, the back-to-back champion Dolphins and the two-time champion Raiders. An AFC team won nine of the first 11 Super Bowls after the merger, and from 1972-1980, the AFC never had a losing record in interconference play.The 1980s and much of the 1990s belonged to the NFC, with the conference at one point winning 13 straight Super Bowls thanks to powerhouses in San Francisco, Washington, Dallas and New York. Interconference play was closer to even, but the NFC hosted a lot of parades.\nIn the 2000s, the AFC re-emerged with Tom Brady's Patriots, Peyton Manning's Colts, Ben Roethlisberger's Steelers and others leading the way. Still, since 2000, interconference play has been basically even. It just feels like the NFC is so much stronger because it is so far this year and was last year, too.NFC win pct vs. AFC -- Last five seasonsSuper Bowl winner2025.658 (through Week 7)???2024.588Eagles (NFC)2023.425Chiefs (AFC)2022.512Chiefs (AFC)2021.506Rams (NFC)Does conference strength determine a champion?Here are the best single-season performances by one conference vs. the other.Best interconference record by seasonWin pctSuper Bowl winner1979 AFC.692Steelers (AFC)1970 NFC.692Colts (AFC) <<2004 AFC.688Patriots (AFC)1977 AFC.679Cowboys (NFC)2025 NFC.658???2017 NFC.641Eagles (NFC)>> Were in NFL in 1969Maybe -- just maybe -- being among the best teams in the better conference leads to Super Bowl titles.

But there's one final factor to consider.It's still earlyYes, the NFC looks better and deeper than the AFC right now. It's also still early. Things could turn around as early as this week. There are eight interconference games in Week 8, and the AFC team is favored in six of them. One good week for the AFC will make a big dent in on the NFC's early season record and take it from historically excellent to merely good.Even if it doesn't happen this week, zooming out provides reason for AFC improvement. One would expect the Ravens to improve with a healthy Lamar Jackson. The Bengals suddenly look viable with Joe Flacco at quarterback. The Chiefs look back to their normal selves. Take a deep breath. It's still early, and while the AFC may not have the dominant upper tier we expected entering the year, those preseason favorites can get rolling in a hurry.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Indiana coach Curt Cignetti officially signed a long-term extension with the school last Thursday, locking him in with the program he has resurrected over the past two years. The Hoosiers rank No. 2 in the AP Top 25, their highest ranking in program history. On paper, Cignetti will receive a $500,000 base salary and \"outside, marketing and promotional\" income of $9.65 million starting December 1, 2025. He will also receive an annual $1 million retention bonus, pushing his salary during the first full salary term to $11.15 million. If he stays on campus, the contract is scheduled to increase by $100,000 every year. The retention bonus also increases to $1.25 million in 2029 if he is still at the school. Cignetti's contract is fully guaranteed -- including retention bonuses -- should Indiana fire him. He is subject to offset language, meaning that any job he took after getting fired would count against the money owed to him. If Cignetti left for another job, he would owe $15 million over the next year, $12 million in 2027-28, $9 million in 2028-29, $4 million from 2029-30, $2 million from 2030-31 and $1 million from 2031-32. If either athletic director Scott Dolson or president Pamela Whitten are no longer in their roles, the buyout will go down by half. \nWhat remains notable -- as Cignetti rebuffs interest from power players like Penn State and Florida -- are the guarantees that Indiana will invest monetarily among the elite programs in college football. \n        \n            \n                College football coaching carousel 2025-26: Ranking every FBS vacancy from Florida and Penn State to UAB\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBuilt-in adjustmentsLike many coaching contracts, there are major incentives tied to on-field success for Cignetti. However, the deal also includes unusual language that ensures Cignetti stays among the most competitive coaches in the Big Ten for the long term. If Indiana reaches the College Football Playoff Semifinal, the university has 120 days to negotiate a new contract that would put him in the top three earners nationally. If they fail to come to terms, the buyout Cignetti would have to pay to leave will drop to zero. Indiana will also make a \"good faith effort\" to meet revenue sharing targets to remain competitive with the best in college football, and will meet annually with Cignetti to review. \nThe Hoosiers will also guarantee Cignetti a staff salary pool that ranks no lower than fifth in the Big Ten or top 10 nationally. That will allow him to retain some of the major up-and-comers who have defined his rise through James Madison and Indiana, including offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and defensive coordinator Bryant Haines. The assurances in the contract are aggressive, and guarantee that Cignetti will have the support and resources to compete at the top of college football. Plenty of incentives, perksCignetti has pledged to spend the rest of his career and retire at Indiana, and the Hoosiers are making it worth his while. From an on-field perspective, Cignetti also has plenty of incentives. Some of those include: \n$100,000 for reaching a fifth Big Ten win;$250,000 for a Top six finish in the Big Ten and $500,000 for a top 2 finish;$1 million for winning the Big Ten; $500,000 for a CFP First Round Appearance, $1 million for national runner up, $2 million for a national championship; $100,000 for winning a major national Coach of the Year award. There are also major lifestyle perks tied to the contract, including: Unlimited access to the local Pfau Golf Course and driving range for his family; Meals provided at the athletic dining facility; A $10,000 Adidas budget per year; $25,000 for courtesy car use; Eight season tickets, three parking passes and 25 single-game tickets for home football games. Long term viewThree years ago, Cignetti was an FCS football coach. Ten years ago, he was making $130,000 to coach Division II football. Now, he ranks among the three highest-paid coaches in the sport at more than $11 million per season. The Hoosiers are 18-2 under Cignetti's watch, with the only losses coming against the two participants in the 2024 national championship game. They went on the road and shocked No. 3 Oregon this year for perhaps the biggest win in the history of the program. But with this contract, Indiana did more than just lock itself into a fantastic coach. The Hoosiers committed themselves to investing and contending at the top of major college football. The new player compensation era was going to create surprising new contenders, and Indiana has benefitted greatly from the influx of money from major donors -- headlined by Mark Cuban. \nOhio State holds a unique place in the modern Big Ten. Outside of the Buckeyes, the Hoosiers are investing at a level unmatched by almost anyone else in the conference. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        So far in our State of the Position series here at the Fantasy Baseball Today Newsletter, we've focused on positions with warts of varying sizes. Catcher is better than it's been in a long time, for instance, but there's a lot riding on a lot of one-year breakouts, which is never a sure thing. First base still has plenty of power to go around, but we're still waiting for the next generation of stars (besides Nick Kurtz) to take over from the fading superstars. You can poke holes at every infield position … except shortstop. It's both the deepest position when it comes to star players – six players were worth at least $20 at shortstop last season, per the FanGraphs.com Player Rater, more than any non-outfield position – and when it comes to sub-star-but-still-good contributors. There's a pretty good chance in any 2026 draft, one of your first few picks will be a shortstop, and in deeper leagues, there's a very good chance your middle infielder (and possibly your DH) will come from this crop, too. One thing I want to do differently with this shortstop column before moving on to our typical 2025 recap/2026 offseason preview is to highlight the prospects earlier in this piece than usual. Because the position is so ridiculously loaded with future stars you need to know about, in addition to the current group of stars. But also, because at least a few of these top prospect shortstops seem pretty likely to end up playing a different position in the majors, which should help the depth at second and third base, especially.So, before we get to anything else about shortstop, let's run through the top prospects who could make an impact in 2026: \nTop rookies to know for 2026Kevin McGonigle, Tigers – There's a spot here, either at shortstop (where he is considered a bit stretched defensively) if they opt to re-sign Gleyber Torres, or as Torres' replacement at second base. We'd probably prefer the second option, since second base needs a new potential impact bat, but McGonigle's bat should play anywhere. He's arguably the top prospect in the game coming off a season where he hit .305/.408/.583 as a 20-year-old across three levels, though he did run his worst numbers in Double-A – albeit still with more walks than strikeouts and 12 homers in 46 games. His upside looks something like what Geraldo Perdomo did in 2025, potentially with more power. Konnor Griffin, Pirates – The Pirates desperately need to show that they are serious about competing at some point, and aggressively promoting Griffin could be one way to do that. He doesn't even turn 20 until almost a month after Opening Day, but he also got all the way to Double-A and more than held his own at every level in 2025, hitting .333/.415/.527 with 21 homers and 65 steals. The tools aren't quite as loud as Elly De La Cruz's, but the Fantasy impact could be comparable. Leodalis De Vries, Athletics – Statistically, De Vries has operated more in the \"held his own\" range of things, though that started to change when he hit .281/.359/.551 after getting to Double-A last season. As an 18-year-old. He still has a lot of work to do to develop as a switch-hitter, but the tools are loud, and \"holding your own\" as young as De Vries has been is impressive on its own. He'll dictate his own timetable for an A's team still trying to amass talent. \nJesus Made, Brewers – The power is still more theoretical than anything else (just six homers in 115 games in 2025), but scouts are convinced he'll get to it in games eventually. And everything else is there, as he ran above-average contact rates, good plate discipline, and plus athleticism. If he opens 2026 at Double-A (where he played five games at the end of the season), that'll tell us how likely he is to make an impact at some point in 2026. JJ Wetherholt, Cardinals – Wetherholt almost certainly won't be a shortstop for the Cardinals, given the presence of Masyn Winn. We can use the help at second or third base more anyway, and Wetherholt should fit in either spot. In his first full professional season, Wetherholt was excellent at both Double-A and Triple-A and has the kind of well-rounded skill set that brings to mind someone like Xander Bogaerts at his best. Sebastian Walcott, Rangers – Walcott is another one whose production looks a lot more impressive when you account for him being 19 at Double-A for all of last season. He might end up moving off shortstop soon, or he might end up forcing Corey Seager to a corner. Walcott has huge power potential that could lead to 30-plus homers in the long run, but like Oneil Cruz, he hasn't quite figured out how to maximize that, either due to contact limitations or a swing not quite geared toward driving the ball out of the park just yet. A 35% infield flyball rate in particular stands out as concerning here, though again, his age is a mitigating factor. A big spring could get him into some Opening Day discussions, but it's more likely the Rangers will want to see him dominate at Triple-A before calling him up, especially since he won't be 20 until just a few weeks before Opening Day. \nColt Emerson, Mariners – If the Mariners were looking for an obvious spot in the lineup to upgrade, one of the middle infield spots is the likeliest place. He has just 40 games combined above A-ball, so Emerson probably isn't an Opening Day candidate, but a big start to the season could push Emerson onto the roster. Now, here's everything else you need to know:  2025 Shortstop Review Bobby Witt: .295 - 99 - 23 - 88 - 38Francisco Lindor: .267 - 117 - 31 - 86 - 31Geraldo Perdomo: .29 - 98 - 20 - 100 - 27Elly De La Cruz: .264 - 102 - 22 - 86 - 37Trevor Story: .263 - 91 - 25 - 96 - 31Trea Turner: .304 - 94 - 15 - 69 - 36Gunnar Henderson: .274 - 85 - 17 - 68 - 30C.J. Abrams: .257 - 92 - 19 - 60 - 31Zachary Neto: .257 - 82 - 26 - 62 - 26Maikel Garcia*: .286 - 81 - 16 - 74 - 23Bo Bichette: .311 - 78 - 18 - 94 - 4Nico Hoerner*: .297 - 89 - 7 - 61 - 29*Won't be SS-eligible in 2026 How much better is shortstop than the other two infield positions? Well, Hoerner was the No. 2 second baseman in 2025, while Garcia was the No. 10 3B, which tells the story pretty well. Take those two out, since they don't qualify for shortstop in 2026 – and since you'd almost always rather use a multi-eligible player at the non-SS position – and you have Willy Adames and Dansby Swanson. Swanson went 24-20, and Adames had his usual 30 homers and 12 steals, and while both give you something back in batting average, they're also both excellent starting options. And Jeremy Pena (No. 15 despite missing 37 games) and Mookie Betts (No. 16 despite a long slump to open the season) were obviously starting-caliber Fantasy options when they were healthy, and Ceddanne Rafaela and Jacob Wilson both were for most of the season, too. Yeah, shortstop is the deepest position, even if the true impact bats might run out before your draft is over.  \tBiggest Breakout from 2025Geraldo Perdomo, Diamondbacks If there was one player I could find out the 2026 price for right now, it would unquestionably be Perdomo. He was the No. 15 player in Fantasy last season, per the FanGraphs.com Player Rater tool, and even if you discounted that a little for a likely unsustainable 720 plate appearances, he was still unquestionably one of the best players in Fantasy at any position. And it doesn't really look unsustainable – his .370 xwOBA is a little ahead of his actual .361 mark, but a pull-heavy swing from both sides of the plate can help explain at least some of that discrepancy. He started swinging the bat harder than he had in previous seasons to tap into a bit more quality of contact, and he did it without sacrificing his elite plate discipline or swing decisions. \nAnd here's the thing I like most: He just kept getting better. Perdomo's three best months by xwOBA were August, September, and July. He had seven batted balls that traveled at least 400 feet in those three months; he had seven in 401 games between 2021 and 2024 combined. That was a new level of power and production we've never seen before, and it came after Perdomo had already broken out in the first half, and presumably after the league adjusted its scouting reports to account for that. The \"adjustment to the adjustment\" is always the biggest thing I'm looking for with breakouts, and Perdomo answered that question about as resoundingly as possible. So, what's the be skeptical about? Well, this was a huge outlier for Perdomo's career. He had a .547 OPS as a rookie, and then settled in with a .712 and .718 mark the next two seasons. And he wasn't much better in the minors, where he had a .755 OPS overall and just a .708 mark at Double-A (while largely skipping Triple-A). He's young, yes, but not so young that anyone likely saw this kind of leap coming. So, we have the underlying numbers largely backing his breakout up, and then we have that breakout standing out as a huge outlier for his career. That's a tough nut to crack.Ultimately, I'm leaning toward buying Perdomo's breakout, though not entirely. He's my No. 7 shortstop in my first round of rankings and will likely end up around 50th in my overall rankings when I unveil them in a couple of months. Whether I buy Perdomo for my teams in 2026 will likely depend on where his cost settles. I could see him around 70th overall, in which case I'll have a bit of exposure, but not a ton; if he ends up around 100th or later (which seems plausible!), I'm going to end up with him on a lot of teams. \n \tBiggest Bust from 2025Oneil Cruz, Pirates* Cruz not only didn't take a step forward this season but was actually worse in 2025 than in 2024. He's still shown basically no ability to hit lefties, and he isn't good enough against righties to overcome that and be an impact bat despite legitimate 80-grade raw power. You'll draft him, hoping for a repeat of his near-40 steals, but he feels like another Luis Robert to me. But he isn't shortstop eligible for 2026, so let's turn our attention to … Gunnar Henderson, OriolesHenderson looked like he was turning into a truly elite hitter when he had 28 homers and hit .286/.373/.584 in 95 games the first half of the 2024 season. In 218 games since, however, he is hitting just .273/.350/.441 with just 26 homers. The perception of Henderson as an elite Fantasy option is heavily colored by that first half in 2024, and it's also starting to look like a pretty significant outlier for his career. We can't just ignore that.On the other hand, he entered the 2025 season dealing with an intercostal strain, and while he was ultimately healthy enough to play after missing just a few games, it's entirely possible that having his Spring Training disrupted that way was enough to derail his whole season. It wouldn't be the first time something like that has happened.\nI'm mostly willing to give Henderson the benefit of the doubt for his 2025 season, personally. I like a player who has multiple paths to value, and Henderson stealing 30 bases in a down year as a hitter is a nice example of that. And, while the production was disappointing, the underlying numbers suggest he probably deserved better than that, with an average exit velocity of 92.1 mph (in the 89th percentile for all hitters) and an expected batting average of .285. Henderson may not be as good a bet for 35-plus homers moving forward as we thought he would be, but I think he's a pretty good bet to hit .280, to top 25 homers and steals, and give us good run production in what should be a better Orioles lineup. He probably shouldn't be a no-doubt first-rounder anymore, but he's a fine bet for a bounce-back in the second round.  \tBiggest rankings movers from 2025 to 2026Up: Zachary Neto, Angels; Geraldo Perdomo, Diamondbacks; Jeremy Pena, Astros; Colson Montgomery, White Sox Neto's price will rise for two reasons: First is because he won't be coming off shoulder surgery that will limit his availability in April like he was a year ago. But, more importantly, it's because he went out there in 2025 and confirmed that his 2024 breakout was no fluke. He's a threat to go 30-30 in any given season moving forward, and while you shouldn't project a helpful batting average, he's still young enough to think there might be some room for growth there. \nPena had a similar breakout to Perdomo, albeit with more to be skeptical of, in my opinion. For one thing, Pena is three years older, creating less room for the kind of natural growth that might lead to a breakout. For another thing, he overperformed his expected stats by a greater margin, managing a .363 wOBA compared to a .344 xwOBA. And then there's this: While Perdomo kept getting better as the season progressed, Pena was worse after the All-Star break. I hold that latter point against Pena less because it mostly came down to a tough August, which came after his return from a fractured rib that cost him all of July. Pena doesn't have Perdomo's elite plate discipline, either, so it just strikes me as a more fragile profile, overall. I'm not entirely fading Pena, to be clear, but I am more skeptical of him than Perdomo at this point. And then there's Montgomery, who I might be more skeptical of than any of 2025's breakouts. The power is legit, and might be enough as a carrying tool to keep him Fantasy relevant. He has a swing geared to getting the absolute most out of his above-average raw power, with a 27% pulled air rate helping explain how Montgomery hit 21 homers in just 71 games. The problem is, well, that's really the only skill he showed at the MLB level. There's no speed to speak of here (47th percentile sprint speed, zero steal attempts in the majors), and he combines both poor swing decisions and below-average contact skills. While his swing orientation might lead to lots of homers, it's going to lead to lots of easy fly balls when he just gets under one. Batting average is likely going to be a problem, and Montgomery isn't likely to run strong on-base percentages or add much value on the basepaths. If he's hitting 30-plus homers, he can still be a viable middle infielder, but if he's more like a 25-homer guy, there isn't much else to carry the profile. For a young player, I'm pretty pessimistic about Montgomery. Down: Anthony Volpe, Yankees; Willy Adames, GiantsThere was still some hope that Volpe might take another step forward this time last year, and maybe the torn labrum he recently had surgery to repair helps explain why his 2025 was so bad. But that's now three very poor seasons with the bat for Volpe, and he doesn't do enough to make up for that at this point. He's proven he can get to 20-20 (or close, as in 2025), but it's going to come with one of the most harmful batting averages of any regular player and poor counting stats. And now he'll be coming back from shoulder surgery and potentially won't be ready for Opening Day in 2026, so I think he's squarely just a late-round middle infield flier at this point. \nAdames ended up having a pretty solid, pretty typical season in 2025, finishing with 30 homers, 12 steals, 181 combined runs and RBI, and a pretty poor batting average. The reason he's moving down is because in 2025, he had a pretty atypical season, setting career highs in homers, steals, runs, and RBI, while hitting .251, one of the best marks of his career. The batting average is a big drag, but otherwise, Adames should be a very strong contributor, and there's at least a chance he does better in 2026 after struggling early on with his new team in 2025.  Offseason preview  \tWho needs an upgrade most?  BravesBlue JaysYankeesRed SoxMarlinsGuardiansTigersPiratesTwinsSome of these are contingent – the Blue Jays won't need a shortstop if they re-sign Bo Bichette, and the Red Sox won't need one if Trevor Story doesn't opt out. Similarly, the Tigers may not actually have a need for a shortstop if they just decide to go with Kevin McGonigle there, which they very well may. But the Braves' shortstop spot is one of the most obvious holes any team has, and the Yankees' spot might not be far behind. You can live with holes in the lineup when you've got MVP candidates up and down the lineup like the Braves had a few years ago, but with their lineup-wide regression, that shortstop spot has become a glaring problem, and one I expect them to take a big swing to try to fix this offseason (even if Ha-seong Kim doesn't turn down his contract option, frankly). I'm less certain the Yankees will be aggressive there, both because if Volpe gets back to being an elite defender, his problems with the bat become easier to stomach. \n \tTop impending free agents Bo BichetteTrevor Story*Ha-seong Kim**Luis RengifoJorge Mateo*Has an opt-out for 2026**Has a player option for 2026If Story doesn't opt out, this becomes a one-man free agent class, and Bichette probably shouldn't be playing shortstop in the long run anyway. He's coming off a big bounce-back season and should garner a nine-figure contract, but I could also see this being another protracted free agency process, given Bichette's injury issues and long-term defensive question marks. If your team isn't operating in the nine-figure contract waters, there just isn't much here. \tTrade candidates C.J. Abrams, NationalsAbrams is a pretty good player who seems like he should be a great player. Part of the issue is that he has faded in the second half of what otherwise looked to be breakout seasons two years in a row. And part of the issue is that he probably isn't a shortstop. His glove would play better at second base, and his athleticism might help him make the transition to the outfield seamlessly. He's probably a better fit in both spots in the long run. The Nationals may decide the best move in the long run is to ship Abrams out for a big haul before he gets expensive and his lack of a long-term defensive home starts to hold his value back on the market. It would be a tough pill to swallow, but the Nationals need to find a way to get off the treadmill of mediocrity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the clock wound down Friday night at TCF Bank Stadium with Minnesota leading Nebraska 24-6, the reaction to the result was predictable. Nebraska, coming into the game ranked for the first time since Week 3 of last season, blew it. Matt Rhule, who had been mentioned with the suddenly vacant Penn State job all week, blew it as well.I get it. That's how it works when the teams with the numbers next to their names lose to those without them. However, I had a different takeaway in the immediate aftermath. I thought, \"Boy, P.J. Fleck does not get nearly enough credit for what he's done at Minnesota.\"The win improved the Gophers to 5-2 on the season and 3-1 in the Big Ten. They are a win away from their fifth straight bowl appearance, which would tie the school's record for consecutive postseason berths. It also improved Fleck's record to 37-37 in Big Ten games. If you take out his first season, the Gophers are 35-30 in Big Ten play, and if you ignore 2020 (and, honestly, we should all ignore the results of the COVID season, because they've mostly proven meaningless) he's 32-26. Those numbers won't wow you, but in the context of where Minnesota has historically found itself in the Big Ten over the last 75 years, it's impressive.Minnesota has won seven national titles in its history, but none since 1960. If we consider only the modern era of college football (since the BCS began in 1998), Minnesota has finished with a winning conference record eight times in 27 seasons. Fleck is responsible for four of them, and is two wins away from his fifth.\nWhat Fleck has done at Minnesota reminds me a lot of what Hayden Fry and then Kirk Ferentz have done at Iowa. He's taken a Big Ten program that isn't considered one of the league's best and consistently found ways to exceed expectations every season. Coincidentally, that's who Fleck's Gophers will face this week in one of the Big Ten's traditional rivalry games.There's a bronze pig on the line, folks!Now, before Iowa fans throw heavy objects at me, Fleck has not taken Minnesota to the same kind of heights Fry and Ferentz have reached at Iowa. Hayden Fry took the Hawkeyes to the Rose Bowl three times. Kirk Ferentz has two Big Ten titles, a Rose Bowl appearance, and an Orange Bowl appearance on top of it. Fleck has never won the Big Ten and his biggest bowl was a Cotton Bowl appearance with Western Michigan that led to him landing the Minnesota job.My comparison is more about what Minnesota has become under Fleck. Some may have seen Nebraska going on the road to Minnesota and losing as some kind of big upset. Perhaps it was on the point spread, but it wasn't a shock to anybody who pays close attention. Much like Big Ten teams have found going into Kinnick Stadium and facing the Hawkeyes to be difficult, the same thing is happening with road trips to Minneapolis.\nOn Friday night it was No. 25 Nebraska who lost. Last season No. 11 USC came into TCF Bank Stadium and fell 24-17. A month and a half later it was No. 4 Penn State that narrowly avoided disaster in a 26-25 win. In a year where it feels like so many Big Ten programs are wondering who they are and what their place in the league is, Minnesota has an identity under Fleck. The Gophers might surprise you, but they don't surprise themselves.Let's rank rivalry trophiesAll right, since the Floyd of Rosedale is on the line Saturday in Iowa City, and I love that damn pig, it feels like a good time to rank the top five Big Ten rivalry trophies. These rankings are final, and if you disagree, it's because you are wrong and need to reevaluate everything you've ever felt or thought to this point in your life. Perhaps then you'll figure out why you're rankings are wrong.\nAnyway, here we go.1. Floyd of Rosedale2. Paul Bunyan's Axe3. Illibuck4. Paul Bunyan Trophy5. Little Brown JugWisconsin is badTo the surprise of nobody, Wisconsin was dominated by Ohio State in a 34-0 loss. This performance came on the heels of a 37-0 loss to Iowa the week before. That's right, the Badgers have not scored a point in a football game since kicking a 39-yard field goal to cut Michigan's lead to 24-10 with 2:43 left to play. It has been 122 minutes and 43 seconds of game time since the Badgers put a point on the board.They have been outscored 122-20 in four Big Ten games. No other Big Ten team has scored fewer than 64 points in conference play this year. Things are pretty bad, but I don't know if these numbers truly explain it, so let's take it a step further.\nThere have been 36 Big Ten conference games played so far this year, and Wisconsin's average of -0.42 EPA per snap was the second-worst performance of the season in any of those contests. The worst? Well, that was Wisconsin's 37-0 loss to Iowa last week. It averaged -0.58 against the Hawkeyes.What's that? You want it to hurt more? Well, I've got good news for you sickos, no other Big Ten team has had an average EPA per play worse than -0.34 this year, so not only does Wisconsin have the two worst performances, it has them by a mile!Oh, and Wisconsin's -0.20 performance against Maryland ranks as the 10th-worst this year. So the Badgers claim three of the 10 worst offensive showings of the Big Ten season. No other Big Ten team has more than one of the worst 10, and what's crazier is all three of Wisconsin's have come at home.\nOffenseOpponentEPA per Snap1. WisconsinIowa-0.582. WisconsinOhio State-0.423. Purdueat Northwestern-0.344. Illinoisat Indiana-0.345. RutgersOregon-0.326. Minnesotaat Ohio State-0.297. Washingtonat Michigan-0.258. Marylandat UCLA-0.219. OregonIndiana-0.2010. WisconsinMaryland-0.20Their best performance was -0.15 against Michigan, which checks in as the 15th-worst. Seriously, everyone, it's been very bad.Dylan Raiola cannot stop getting sackedDylan Raiola was sacked nine times in Nebraska's loss to Minnesota, which is obviously the most he's ever been sacked in a game. But this is not a new problem. Raiola has been sacked frequently this season. After being sacked 25 times last year, he's now been dropped 26 times in 2025, and we're barely past the halfway point of the regular season.The only quarterback who has been sacked more often than Raiola this year is Auburn's Jackson Arnold, who is at 27. I place a lot of the blame for this on Raiola's shoulders.He has a pressure-to-sack ratio of 2.81. For those who aren't clear, that just means how many times is the QB pressured for every sack he takes. Among the 116 qualified quarterbacks, Raiola's ratio ranks 116th. Jackson Arnold is 115th at 3.00.Some people will want to blame the offensive line, and I'm not going to absolve that unit of blame, but Raiola's only been pressured on 29.1% of his dropbacks. That ranks 54th of 116 qualified QBs. Also, while PFF grades are far from a holy grail, PFF gives Nebraska's offensive line a pass-blocking grade of 78.7 on the season. That ranks 13th among the 136 FBS teams.I've been critical of Raiola on the Cover 3 Podcast this year. I do not think he is a fundamentally sound player, and it annoys me because, from a talent perspective, there aren't many in the country with his arm talent. He has great arm strength and tremendous accuracy. He can make every throw in the book, and he can do so in different ways. But he gets sloppy in his footwork and it leads to misses that shouldn't happen far too often.Then there are the sacks he's taking. A lot of them are products of his desire to make plays happen off script. Sometimes he does something spectacular, like this.\nMore often, instead of stepping up in the pocket to escape pressure, he moves backwards or tries to roll to his right or left to buy more time to do something incredible, but only ends up running into the waiting arms of a defender.The sacks put Nebraska's offense in tough positions, which then causes Raiola to put more pressure on himself to do something great, which leads to more sacks. It's something he and the Cornhuskers have gotten away with in nonconference games, but it hurts them in Big Ten games.Until Raiola starts understanding that boring plays can be more effective than spectacular ones, Nebraska will have a tough time winning consistently in the Big Ten.Going with my gutEvery week I pick the Big Ten games against the spread based on nothing but my gut reaction to the number. No digging into numbers -- just vibes, baby. I even track my record to embarrass myself publicly. Any game not included is due to there not being a posted line at time of publishing.\nMinnesota at Iowa: OK, here's the deal. It's hard for me to trust Iowa to cover a spread this large when the Hawkeyes were barely able to beat Penn State at home last week. This was a Penn State team that was on a three-game losing streak that got its coach fired, and had lost its starting quarterback for the year to an injury. There was no excuse for Iowa to make that one so close. Now you've got Minnesota coming to town with the Floyd of Rosedale on the line. I have to take the points here.

It's the bye week. At the running back position, we are without Jahmyr Gibbs, Kyren Williams, Travis Etienne, Kenneth Walker, Ashton Jeanty, David Montgomery, and Zach Charbonnet. As you might imagine, most teams are going to have to start someone at the position they haven't started all year. Unfortunately, there is also not a lot of help available on the waiver wire. No one in my top 24 at the position is available in even a third of CBS leagues. Even Kenneth Gainwell is still rostered in. That means most people are going to have to look to their bench for a starter. Guys like Isiah Pacheco, who was started in only 37% of leagues last week, may see their start percentage double. In the case of Pacheco, that may even be warranted.Pacheco had a season-high 15 rush attempts last week against the Raiders and turned that into a season-high 11 PPR Fantasy points. One reason is because Geno Smith and the Raiders were not competitive, and the Chiefs quickly built an insurmountable lead. Well, they were 10-5-point favorites for that game early last week. As of Tuesday afternoon, they are 10.5-point favorites over the Commanders, who we expect to start Marcus Mariota on Monday night. The Commanders have also given up at least 126 yards on the ground to running backs in three of their last four games. This looks like the perfect spot to move Pacheco into your starting lineup, and it couldn't have come at a better time for Fantasy managers.Some other running backs who were on the bench last week but could be good starts this week are Woody Marks, RJ Harvey, Kenneth Gainwell, and Tyler Allgeier.Now let's get to the rest of the Week 7 RB Preview:\n\n        Week 7 RB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            5.19 -- The Dolphins are allowing 5.19 yards per carry to running backs. Bijan Robinson is obviously a top running back, but Allgeier could benefit, too.7 -- The Packers have seen seven running back targets per game, second only to Seattle. Expect Jaylen Warren and Gainwell to be involved in the passing game as Aaron Rodgers looks to avoid that pass rush.5.84 -- Rico Dowdle is averaging 5.84 yards per opportunity this year. Chuba Hubbard is at 4.21. The Panthers are probably going to give more work to Dowdle this week.2.15 -- D'Andre Swift is averaging 2.15 yards before contact per attempt. That ranks second behind Jahmyr Gibbs at running back.44.9% -- Kyle Monangai played 44.9% of the snaps in Week 7, a season-high. The Bears are running so well you may be able to start both of their backs against the Ravens this week.14 -- Brashard Smith has 14 catches in his last four games. Last week was the first week they gave him noticeable work in the running game, and it didn't go well. But if he carves out eight to 10 rushes per game in the second half, he could become the Chiefs best back. 7.5 -- Chase Brown has averaged 7.5 yards per carry over the past two weeks after averaging 2.5 the first five. With all the teams on a bye, you are probably starting Brown this week.79 -- The Bengals have missed a league-high 79 tackles. It should be a nice bounce-back week for Breece Hall.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n

up for our bye week blues. But Monangai is coming off a 15-touch game in which he scored 16.4 PPR Fantasy points.

He has been legitimately good as a receiver, averaging 8.7 yards per reception, and could have some long-term upside if he gets more comfortable running between the tackles.\n            \n            \n\nStashes (RB Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #33\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DAL -1.5\n                                    O/U 51.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                29th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                63%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    160\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    64\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Benson is eligible to return in Week 10, and I expect him to be the unquestioned lead back in this offense once he is 100%. Bam Knight is also a stash candidate if you have a running back on bye in Week 9. Knight had 17 touches in Week 7 and is the team's goal-line back. But Benson is a much better player and could be a league winner in the second half.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n

The schedule is set to feature preseason No. 1 Purdue six times along with appearances from No. 2 Houston, No. 6 Duke, No. 7 Michigan and No. 10 Texas Tech, among others. This year's schedule will also feature 15 automatic bids to the 2026 NCAA Men's and Women's NCAA Tournaments, culminating with conference championship games in the Missouri Valley, Mountain West, Atlantic 10 and Big Ten. The action begins on Nov. 27 with Duke vs. Arkansas in the CBS Sports Thanksgiving Classic held on Thanksgiving Day and concludes with the Big Ten Men's Tournament title game on March 15, which is airing on CBS for the 28th consecutive year. In between, stand-alone games will take center stage on CBS platforms including No. 16 Iowa State at No. 1 Purdue in Mackey Arena, Louisville vs. Indiana in Gainbridge Fieldhouse and Baylor at Memphis in FedEx Forum. And those three examples are just part of a sampling of the first Saturday in December. \nAlso part of the schedule will be the 12th annual CBS Sports Classic on Dec. 20 with five of the six participating teams ranked in the preseason AP Top 25. The CBS Sports Classic will begin with No. 5 St. John's and No. 9 Kentucky at 12:30 p.m. ET  followed by No. 25 North Carolina vs. Ohio State in Atlanta's State Farm Arena  and concludes with a 5:30 p.m. tip between No. 2 Houston and No. 14 Arkansas at Prudential Center. \n 2025-26 CBS college basketball schedule DateMatchupTime (ET)Thu., Nov. 27CBS Sports Thanksgiving Classic\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t

    "body": "\n        We're nearing the midway point of the 2025 NFL season, and the Minnesota Vikings may soon be on their third starting quarterback of the year. Coach Kevin O'Connell confirmed as much this week, admitting undrafted rookie Max Brosmer is \"an option\" in the event Carson Wentz can't stay on the field as J.J. McCarthy's replacement.Just like the Vikings drew it up, right?Of course not. A year ago at this time, not a single one of Minnesota's three signal-callers was active for the team: McCarthy was recovering from a torn meniscus that erased his entire rookie season, Wentz was on the Kansas City Chiefs' bench as Patrick Mahomes' backup, and Brosmer was throwing passes for the Golden Gophers. Yet somehow these three also represent the Vikings' current remaining hopes for a playoff push, one year after Sam Darnold threw 35 touchdowns en route to 14 wins and a flirtation with the NFC's No. 1 postseason seed.Where did it all go wrong? And should the Vikings really be lambasted for the fact it did?The 2025 season isn't over. Minnesota is 3-3 after six games, which is hardly a death knell. Wentz has flashed some of the big-play arm that once made him a regular starter. McCarthy authored a strong prime-time finish prior to suffering an ankle sprain, and he finally appears to be nearing a return to full health. Even Brosmer drew high marks for his preseason composure, suggesting he'd be a willing warrior if called upon.\nYet the Vikings will be fortunate to keep pace with the rest of the NFC North at this rate. The Detroit Lions are still a powerhouse. The Green Bay Packers might be, too. The Chicago Bears have won four straight and might finally be hitting their stride under new coach Ben Johnson. The Vikings, meanwhile, may boast an occasionally opportunistic defense under Brian Flores, with some of the game's top pass catchers out wide in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison. But a playoff run seems like an increasing fantasy due to the tumult under center.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 Power Rankings: Colts made me eat my words (with hot sauce) as they soar to No. 1\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's a level of disorder for which Minnesota was clearly not prepared. This season was all about ushering in the J.J. McCarthy era. The 2024 first-round draft pick may have entered this year with zero real NFL experience thanks to his rookie-year injury. But O'Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah underscored his internal value at every turn of the offseason, repeatedly looking the other way when it came to more proven alternatives:First, the Vikings declined to enter a bidding war for Darnold, who sunk under pressure in the final two games of 2024 but captained an explosive offense for much of his first year in town, as he's now doing with the Seattle Seahawks. In some ways, this mirrored the club's polite refusal to pay big bucks to Kirk Cousins the year prior.At the same time, the Vikings also declined to enter a bidding war for Daniel Jones, the ex-New York Giants castoff who finished 2024 on Minnesota's practice squad. Jones now looks like a major bargain for the Indianapolis Colts after signing a modest deal, suggesting the Vikings only viewed him as a true Plan B.As the offseason wore on, the Vikings gave mixed signals about interest in Aaron Rodgers, their longtime Packers rival, repeatedly championing McCarthy's potential while leaving the door open for the veteran. In the end, Rodgers put pen to paper with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who were unafraid to court the former MVP.Not a single one of these moves was entirely objectionable at the time. Consider:\nDarnold was a legitimate gunslinger for much of 2024 and still relatively young at 27 (now 28), but his end-of-season flameout was so drastic -- and his free agent price tag so steep -- that the one-and-done partnership made some sense.Jones, meanwhile, would've been an even greater -- albeit cheaper -- gamble after struggling to stay healthy or push the ball downfield over more than five years with the Giants. No one had him pegged for such a sharp Indy breakout.And Rodgers, though very accomplished, was 41 years old coming off two bruised and sluggish seasons with the New York Jets. Banking on him rediscovering high-level form would've also meant going \"all in\" on 2025, effectively redshirting McCarthy for half his initial rookie contract.Instead, the Vikings went the route they took after a half-decade of solid, if unspectacular, work from Cousins: They said thanks but no thanks to the more proven commodities, preferring to lean on infrastructure over a splashier investment under center. They figured the greater setup would be the perfect launching pad for a green youngster like McCarthy.No one questioned the decision internally. Especially not McCarthy's teammates, who kept pointing to the veteran support at the skill spots, the bolstered line featuring new starters in Ryan Kelly and Will Fries, the exotic defense, the proven culture-building of O'Connell. McCarthy himself called the Vikings \"stacked\" in an interview with CBS Sports, and he drew lots of locker-room praise for the veteran-level composure he learned under Jim Harbaugh at Michigan; if his play were uneven, at least his posture would not be.Except this entire plan hinged on McCarthy's play not being so uneven ... and McCarthy staying on the field in the first place. The 22-year-old looked 22, like an unofficial rookie, in his first two starts of the season, struggling to find a sustainable rhythm through the air. Even before he was revealed to have suffered an ankle injury in Week 2, McCarthy already seemed in danger of ceding snaps to Wentz, who arrived late as the top backup:\n[Early-career] hiccups are absolutely not a problem ... if the Vikings are intent on playing this slowly, affording their new point guard the patience he might very well require. That's a fine approach to take, and it's one plenty of rebuilding teams have exercised, declining to put the weight of the NFL world on a first-time starter's shoulders. It's just not the approach O'Connell and Co. seemed to take by suggesting they could transition from proven arms like Darnold and, previously, Kirk Cousins and still end up in the thick of the NFC postseason conversation.Speaking of Wentz, he's now the face of the Vikings' predicament, which only serves to magnify the greater blunder. Set aside the pros and cons of Wentz as a quarterback; the one-time Philadelphia Eagles star remains largely the same roller coaster he's been for years, offering both head-scratching gambles and awe-inspiring gusto. What we don't talk enough about is the fact he's at the center of Minnesota's conundrum -- to hurry McCarthy back, or to pivot to Brosmer? -- despite only joining the team on Aug. 24.Look, some quarterbacks can turn around and help a franchise stay afloat on a few days' notice (see: Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals). But the Bengals had Joe Burrow as their Plan A. The Vikings had McCarthy, a total unknown. They deserve credit for adding Wentz at all, giving O'Connell some actual juice off the bench. They also deserve some pointed questions about waiting until the end of the preseason to acquire said insurance.Did they grossly miscalculate the stability (or lack thereof) of Sam Howell, their initial pick to be McCarthy's backup, when they acquired Howell from the Washington Commanders during the draft? Did they also need all summer to determine they'd botched that bet? And why wait until late April to make that gamble at all? Is it because neither Adofo-Mensah nor O'Connell could make up their minds regarding a last-second pursuit of Rodgers, who didn't actually sign with the Steelers until June?We don't know how the rest of the year will play out, but all of a sudden a one-year Rodgers deal doesn't seem like it would've been such a bad idea. If the infrastructure was so rich, after all, imagine where A-Rod might have Minnesota at this juncture. And imagine how much richer McCarthy might be from watching and learning. But no, the Vikings played a different hand: Why ruin McCarthy's chance at claiming the franchise for himself, and laying the foundation for a long run as \"the guy,\" just to hope an aging has-been can go the distance before retiring? It turns out the choice to let J.J. go unchallenged as the new No. 1 just might ruin any playoff chances instead.\nAt this point, these are just what-ifs. They're revisionist reflections on the past. What's done is done. The Vikings made 2025 about McCarthy. And then McCarthy sputtered out of the gate before going down (again). It should be no surprise, a few weeks later, they're hurting to get things under control at the quarterback position, not so unlike halfway through the 2023 season when Cousins was sidelined and O'Connell was left to squeeze what he could from Joshua Dobbs, another last-minute backup addition, and assorted leftovers. In a weird way, this situation is almost worse, given that Cousins' exit all but gave Minnesota the green light to move on and finally look to the future. McCarthy is -- or was supposed to be -- that future. He was also set up, this year, to be the present.Gambles are gambles. Even if they make sense in the moment, they may not pan out. It's precisely what Minnesota is feeling at this moment. Now the Vikings are hoping, at least for the sake of what's left of 2025, but perhaps also their prospects beyond, that someone -- anyone -- emerges to make it all right.\n            ",

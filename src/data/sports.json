Las Vegas will see Max Holloway defend the symbolic \"BMF\" championship against Charles Oliveira. UFC CEO Dana White announced the fight at the UFC 323 press conference on Friday.Holloway had already established a sure-fire Hall of Fame resume when he added the BMF belt to his mantle. One of the best action fighters of the era, Holloway won the featherweight championship with a TKO victory over Jose Aldo in June 2017. He made four successful defenses of the belt before dropping the title to Alexander Volkanovski.Holloway's only losses in the past decade have come against the elite of the elite, with a loss to Dustin Poirier, three losses to Volkanovski and a loss to Ilia Topuria, all in championship bouts. Holloway avenged the loss to Poirier in his most recent fight, taking a decision at UFC 318 to retain the BMF title he won with an iconic knockout of Justin Gaethje at UFC 300.Holloway is the only fighter to have successfully defended the BMF belt.EventWinnerLoserUFC 244Jorge Masvidal (vacated BMF title upon retirement)Nate DiazUFC 291Justin GaethjeDustin PoirierUFC 300Max HollowayJustin GaethjeUFC 318Max HollowayDustin PoirierOliveira is a former lightweight champion, winning the vacant title at UFC 262 after Khabib Nurmagomedov retired as champion. Oliveira successfully defended the title with a win over Poirier before missing weight for a fight with Gaethje and being stripped of the belt.\nOliveira has gone 3-3 over his six most recent fights, including losing lightweight title matches against Islam Makhachev and Topuria. Despite a recent uneven run, Oliveira is one of the most exciting fighters in the sport, having won 18 fight bonuses (including a record 14 Performance of the Night bonuses), holding the record for most finishes in UFC history (21) and most submission victories in UFC history (17).\n            \n    ",

This is the fifth SEC Title Game meeting between the programs, with Bama winning the previous four. Georgia (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is coming off a Friday win over Georgia Tech, 16-9, while Alabama (10-2, 7-1 SEC) enters off a Saturday victory over Auburn, 27-20. The Tide have won a record 11 SEC Championship Games, while Georgia has won five times previously.Kickoff is at 4 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Tide have won three straight meetings with Georgia, including a 24-21 win on Sep. 27.

Georgia ran all over Bama in their September matchup to the tune of 227 yards on 6.9 yards per carry. That's the most yards Bama allowed to an SEC team all year, and the Tide run defense is still shaky after giving up 152 yards on the ground to Auburn last week. Georgia boasts RB Nate Frazier, who ranks sixth in the SEC with 5.6 yards per carry, as well as WR Zachariah Branch, who tops the SEC with 68 catches. Also, one can't dismiss that Georgia last played on Friday, with Bama on Saturday, and the Tide have covered just once over their last six games when having a rest disadvantage. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Alabama can coverBama has two streaks in its favor over Georgia, starting with the fact that the Tide are 4-0 all-time versus the Bulldogs in the SEC Title Game. Additionally, Alabama has won each of its last three meetings with UGA, with two of those coming since Kalen DeBoer replaced Nick Saban. This season, the Crimson Tide are 8-4 ATS, whereas the Bulldogs are just 5-7 versus the line, including failing to cover in each of their last two games. Bama QB, Ty Simpson, owns a 25:4 TD:INT, and he's complemented by a defense which has been its typical dominant self as of late. The Tide haven't allowed more than two touchdowns in each of their last five games, and they'll see a team on Saturday that has a negative turnover differential on the season. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Alabama vs. Georgia picksSportsLine's model has simulated Georgia vs. Alabama 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points.

Here's the full list of the groups: \nGroup A: Mexico, Korea Republic, South Africa, UEFA Playoff D (Denmark/North Macedonia/Czechia/North Macedonia)Group B: Canada, Switzerland, Qatar, UEFA Playoff A (Italy/Northern Ireland/Wales/Bosnia and Herzegovina)Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Scotland, HaitiGroup D: USA, Australia, Paraguay, UEFA Playoff D (Turkiye/Romania/Slovakia/Kosovo)Group E: Germany, Ecuador, Ivory Coast, CuracaoGroup F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia, UEFA Playoff B (Sweden/Ukraine/Poland/Albania)Group G: Belgium, Iran, Egypt, New ZealandGroup H: Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Cabo VerdeGroup I: France, Senegal, Norway, Intercontinental Playoff 2 (Iraq/Bolivia/Suriname)Group J: Argentina, Austria, Algeria, JordanGroup K: Portugal, Colombia, Uzbekistan, Intercontinental Playoff 1 (DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia)Group L: England, Croatia, Panama, GhanaSo with the draw out of the way, let's take a look at our latest World Cup Power Rankings, with reactions to every team's draw: RankTeamAnalysis1. \t\t\t\tSpain  \t\t\t\tThey've got Lamine Yamal, so there are still the most likely to win the tournament especially after landing Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and Cabo Verde. Ah, the last time Saudi Arabia won a match in the group stage it was against Argentina that later won the 2022 World Cup. Might be a good sign. 2. \t\t\t\tArgentina \t\t\t\tTalking about the 2022 World Cup winners, they still have a chance but the group stage isn't as easy as it might look like. Austria and Algeria are strong teams and it won't be easy to win both matches in the group. Lionel Messi is expected to play his last World Cup in his career, and he wants to leave the stage in a good way.       3. \t\t\t\tFrance \t\t\t\tThe group stage will see an incredible matchup between Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland, but also the one against Senegal won't be easy at all for the team coached by Didier Deschamps, who will leave after the tournament before the likely appointment of Zinedine Zidane. 4. \t\t\t\tBrazil  \t\t\t\tThe five-team world champions hired Carlo Ancelotti to cope with the disappointments of the past editions and they were extremely unlucky in the draw as they will face Morocco, Haiti and Scotland in the opening three games that will definitely define the ambitions of this team. 5. \t\t\t\tEngland \t\t\t\tEngland will face Croatia in the group stage in one of the most interesting matches, and they will also meet Panama and Ghana. The Three Lions hired an international manager like Thomas Tuchel to overcome the disappointments of two European finals lost in three years and this is their chance. 6. \t\t\t\tPortugal  \t\t\t\tWe almost had a potential meeting between Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo but we will save it for later in the tournament. Ronaldo's final World Cup will be a historic moment, but this Portugal side are strong enough to dream big. 7. \t\t\t\tNorway   \t\t\t\tHaaland scored 55 goals with Norway in 48 games. If that's not enough to consider them as a big threat to the other teams, what is? They will immediately face Mbappe and France in the group stage for one of the most intriguing games. 8. \t\t\t\tGermany \t\t\t\tThey are always a team to watch at the World Cup, and after their group stage eliminations in 2018 and 2022, they want revenge. First, they will need to get past of Ecuador, Ivory Coast and Curacao.9. \t\t\t\tNetherlands \t\t\t\tThey are strong but they will face Japan and Tunisia in the group stage, and also one between Poland, Sweden, Ukraine and Albania from the UEFA playoff. That could become a factor. 10. \t\t\t\tMorocco  \t\t\t\tThe biggest surprise of the 2022 World Cup when Morocco only lost to France in the semifinals after winning against Spain and then Portugal. They can make it again but they will face Brazil and Scotland in the group stage. That's something that will make things way more difficult for Achraf Hakimi and his teammates. 11. \t\t\t\tUnited States      Let's be honest: Mauricio Pochettino was really lucky. The USMNT will face Australia, Paraguay and the winner of the UEFA Playoff B (Sweden/Ukraine/Poland/Albania). It couldn't have gone better. 12. \t\t\t\tBelgium  \t\t\t\tA lot will depend on the form of players like Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku as they might play their last World Cup if they fully recover from their injuries. 13. \t\t\t\tUruguay \t\t\t\tIt will be fun to see Marcelo Bielsa back at the World Cup after he managed Argentina in 2002 and Chile in 2010. Facing Spain in the group stage is not what he was hoping for.      14. \t\t\t\tJapanWatch out for Japan because they are solid and full of talent. Also the younger national teams look competitive and they can achieve big things in the near future. Only Netherlands are a stronger team in their group.  15. \t\t\t\tSouth Korea  \t\t\t\tSon Heung-min is set to play what will be his last World Cup but there is much more to know about this side that surprised the world when they eliminated Germany at the 2018 World Cup. They will meet Mexico, South Africa and the winner of the UEFA Playoff D (Denmark/North Macedonia/Czechia/Republic of Ireland).16. \t\t\t\tCroatia  \t\t\t\tAnother historic national team preparing for an emotional farewell is Croatia, as Luka Modric, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup finalist, is set to play his final tournament. They will face England, Ghana and Panama. They should end up at least in second place in the table. 17. \t\t\t\tMexico  \t\t\t\tThey have the potential to at least qualify for the round of 32 but watch out for their opponents. They will play the opening match against South Africa in what will be one of the most awaited games of the year. 18. \t\t\t\tSwitzerland \t\t\t\tThe team coached by Murat Yakin qualified for the 2026 World Cup with strong ambitions. If Italy qualify for the World Cup, their group with Qatar and Canada will be much more difficult than what it looks like now. 19. \t\t\t\tEcuador \t\t\t\tLa Tri only conceded five goals in the 17 matches played in the World Cup qualifiers, something that really stands out ahead of the tournament. They will need that defensive strength when they will face Germany, Ivory Coast and Curacao.20. \t\t\t\tIran  \t\t\t\tIran dominated their group stage of qualification, losing only one of the 10 games played, we shouldn't underestimate them as they will face Belgium, Egypt and New Zealand. They have real chances to go through. 21. \t\t\t\tCanada \t\t\t\tJesse Marsch will lead Canada at the 2026 World Cup that will be played on their home soil. A lot will depend on who will qualify in the last spot of the group. If Italy do, things will be much more difficult for Canada. 22. \t\t\t\tAustria \t\t\t\tWhen Ralf Rangnick chose to take over as head coach of the Austrian national team, many people questioned his decision. Now, we understand exactly why he made that choice but he will need to show it against 2022 World Cup winner Argentina. 23. \t\t\t\tEgypt \t\t\t\tThe African team failed to win a single match in their World Cup history with an overall record of five defeats and two draws. They now have the chance to make history with Mohamed Salah leading the team in what will likely be his last World Cup. 24. \t\t\t\tSenegal \t\t\t\tThey dominated the group stage of qualifying as they were undefeated, scoring 22 goals and only conceding only three goals but they will face France and Norway in the group phase. It will be difficult. 25. \t\t\t\tScotland \t\t\t\tThey went to the the worst group possible with Brazil and Morocco. They desperately need the best version of Scott McTominay, the 2024–25 Serie A MVP of the season from Napoli.26. \t\t\t\tSaudi Arabia \t\t\t\tAfter a disappointing spell under Roberto Mancini who left the team in 2024, the Saudi Arabian side called back Herve Renard and will face Spain, Uruguay and Cabo Verde in the group stage. 27. \t\t\t\tColombia \t\t\t\tColombia's seventh World Cup appearance comes from a strong qualification group when they ended up tied on points with teams such as Brazil and Uruguay. They will face Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo in the group stage.        28. \t\t\t\tTunisia \t\t\t\tWith 22 goals scored, none conceded, nine wins and one draw, Tunisia have been one of the most impressive teams in the qualifiers. They have chances with Japan and Netherlands, but a lot will depend on who will qualify for the last spot between Sweden, Poland, Albania and Ukraine. 29. \t\t\t\tIvory Coast \t\t\t\tThey did not concede a single goal in the group stage of qualifying, scoring 25 times across 10 matches and finishing with eight wins and two draws but they will need to perform against Curacao, Ecuador and most notably against Germany. 30. \t\t\t\tQatar \t\t\t\tThe 2022 World Cup hosts managed to qualify for their second time ever at the World Cup and are coached by former Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui, who will finally lead a team at the tournament after what happened with Spain in 2018.       31. \t\t\t\tParaguay  \t\t\t\tIt will be the first time Paraguay will play at the World Cup since 2010 and they will face the USMNT and Australia, while they will wait some months to know who is going to be their final opponent between Turkiye, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.32. \t\t\t\tGhana \t\t\t\tThe African side delivered a strong qualifying campaign, winning eight of their 10 matches but they were really unlucky to get both England and Croatia. 33. \t\t\t\tAustralia \t\t\t\tIn 2022, they only lost to Argentina in the round of 16. As mentioned with the United States, things will be much more difficult if Turkiye join the group. 34. \t\t\t\tAlgeriaManaged at the World Cup by former Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic, Algeria can compete with Jordan and Austria for a spot in the round of 32. No doubt.35. \t\t\t\tJordanJordan made history by qualifying for the World Cup for the first time. They can't miss this chance and not leave their mark in 2026 and they have a chance with Austria and Algeria, but not with Argentina. 36. \t\t\t\tSouth Africa \t\t\t\tBafana Bafana are back at the World Cup for the first time since they hosted the tournament in 2010 and for the first time in the history, the opening match of the World Cup will be a second timer, with South Africa facing Mexico. 37. \t\t\t\tHaiti \t\t\t\tThe 2026 World Cup will mark Haiti's second appearance at the tournament, their first since 1974. They don't have chances to do better this time as they will face Brazil, Morocco and Scotland in the group. Horrible draw. 38. \t\t\t\tPanama \t\t\t\tAfter qualifying for the 2018 World Cup when they lost all three games against England, Belgium and Tunisia, they will face the Three Lions again, hoping to do better.       39. \t\t\t\tCape Verde \t\t\t\tThey qualified for the first time ever at the World Cup and they are ready to shock the world as they have already done in the qualification stages.  \t\t\t\t40. \t\t\t\tUzbekistan  \t\t\t\tAnother team that will feature at the World Cup for the first time in their history and they will be led by 2006 Ballon d'Or winner and World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro, their coach. 41. \t\t\t\tNew Zealand \t\t\t\tSame group with Belgium, Iran and Egypt. Hard to think they can get points here. 42. \t\t\t\tCuracao \t\t\t\tThe smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup will face giants like Germany, Ivory Coast and Ecuador. What a story, but difficult to imagine they can qualify for the round of 32. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Another day, another cluster of players gathered atop the leaderboard at the 2025 Hero World Challenge. Akshay Bhatia, Hideki Matsuyama, Wyndham Clark, J.J. Spaun and Cameron Young make up the five-headed monster sitting at 10 under midway through the proceedings at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas.Bhatia bounced back from a bogey on his penultimate hole with a birdie on his last to join the four others on top. This as world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler stumbled slightly with a double bogey on No. 16 due to a wayward drive, dropping from 11 under to 9 under, where he ultimately finished.Scheffler sits in a tie for sixth place alongside Alex Noren and Sepp Straka, while Justin Rose matched an opening 68 with another on Friday to get within two of the lead heading into the weekend.\"I think you can always take good momentum from playing well,\" Scheffler said. \"I wouldn't look too far into it if I didn't have a good week this week, I wouldn't really try to carry that momentum even further. But overall, I feel like it's a good place to kind of see where my game's at and then kind of get ready for the season. It feels like a good warmup event.\"\nMaking the biggest move of the bunch was Scheffler's Ryder Cup teammate, Young, who followed up an opening 70 with a second-round 64 -- the lowest of the 20 players in Round 2. The big-hitting right-hander cruised into his day before finding another gear around the turn, playing Nos. 12-17 in 6 under. If not for a bogey on the last, Young would have fired a sub-30 score on his second nine.\"Made a couple putts late, but it is just one of those courses where, I actually said it to Kyle yesterday, I felt like we played pretty well and comfortably could have shot 4, 5, 6 under, and the scoring made 2 [under] feel kind of bad yesterday,\" Young said. \"But the reality is, day to day out here, you just can have runs of holes where it starts to feel easy, and it's not that different to yesterday. I feel like I played pretty similarly and just made a couple putts down the stretch.\"Young's co-leader, Clark, mentioned he has not putted well through two rounds, and the statistics back up his thoughts as he ranks 16th out of 20 players with the putter in hand. Coincidentally, it is another co-leader in Spaun who ranks last in the field, making the current U.S. Open champion a dangerous proposition moving forward if he figures that club out.\nFor Clark, however, his play all stems from what he does with his full swing. Noting he has started working with a swing coach for the first time in a long time, the three-time PGA Tour winner is making sure to bring only one swing thought to the golf course, leaving the rest for the driving range. And so far, it has been a thought that has worked for him.\"Right now, I just have one swing thought when I play,\" Clark said. \"Like when I'm on the range, I'm thinking of a couple things that I want to do, and then while I'm playing, I'm just thinking about the heel leading the toe coming in so I have an open face. It's just one simple thought, and that's what I'm going with.\"The Year of Young?A breakout star coming out of the Ryder Cup, Young has kept his game in good order over the last two months. The Wyndham Championship winner is among the leaders in the Bahamas, and he has a chance to follow in the footsteps of prior tournament champions, using this event as a springboard for their upcoming year.\nIn 2022, Hovland won this tournament the year before his FedEx Cup victory, while Scheffler used this week to test out a couple of tweaks in his game ahead of his all-time campaigns in 2024 and 2025. Young appears to have a similar mindset on these 72 holes and how valuable they could prove despite their laidback nature.\"It certainly can. I'm kind of not using the week as practice, but I'm using the week to try to build on some things that we've been doing and less so looking at the results just because I haven't played any competition in the last couple months,\" Young said. \"So, it's more just an opportunity to keep building on what we were doing mentally. I don't think the result is necessarily going to dictate the outcome. I think it's going to be more kind of how we go through our process and how we attack the golf course.\"Possible bookendsMatsuyama made noise in the opening week of the year with a record-setting performance at the Sentry en route to victory ... and then was not heard from since. Without a top 10 finish in his PGA Tour season after his victory at Kapalua, the man from Japan aims to bookend his 2025 in style with another win this week.\nWhat has been interesting about Matsuyama's play through 36 holes is the way in which he has gotten the job done. He tops the field in terms of driving accuracy and is inside the top five of putting -- thanks in large part to his Friday showing -- while checking in near the bottom in terms of iron play, where he typically thrives.\"I've been working on everything … we won the first in Hawaii, but didn't play well the rest of the season,\" Matsuyama said. \"So, trying to play well [the] next two days and looking forward to next season.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michael Jordan appeared in court Friday to testify against NASCAR in an antitrust trial. The Basketball Hall of Famer, who co-owns the NASCAR Cup Series team 23XI Racing with driver Denny Hamlin, was called to the witness stand at a North Carolina federal courthouse and spoke out against the racing company's business model.23XI joined Front Row Motorsports to allege that NASCAR committed antitrust violations, and both teams refused to sign the company's new charter agreement which began in the 2025 season. The teams claim that NASCAR's charters are monopolistic and seek changes to the business model.\"Someone had to step forward and challenge the entity,\" Jordan said to the jury. \"I sat in those meetings with longtime owners who were brow-beaten for so many years trying to make change. I was a new person, I wasn't afraid. I felt I could challenge NASCAR as a whole. I felt as far as the sport, it needed to be looked at from a different view.\"The charter system is similar to the franchise model used by other American sports leagues, and it guarantees participation in races and revenue from those races. 23XI and Front Row argue that the revenue model is not viable, though, and they claim that the terms of the charters create a monopolistic environment wherein NASCAR holds exclusivity clauses and tight control over many aspects of the series.While teams asked during negotiations for the renewable charters to become permanent, NASCAR refused. Teams were given just six hours in September 2024 to sign extensions. 23XI and Front Row were the only two to refuse.\n\"One, I didn't think it was economically viable,\" Jordan said, explaining why his team refused to sign. \"Two, it said you could not sue NASCAR. That was an antitrust violation, I felt. Three, they gave us an ultimatum I didn't think was fair to 23XI.\"Jordan and Hamlin formed 23XI in 2020 with Bubba Wallace as their first driver. They secured three full-time entries over the ensuing years, but rather than renewing for the seven-year period, they entered a legal battle with NASCAR.\"I wanted a partnership and permanent charters wasn't even a consideration,\" Jordan said. \"The pillars that the teams wanted, no one on the NASCAR side even negotiated or compromised. They were not even open-minded to welcome those conversations, so this is where we ended up.\"\nIf 23XI and Front Row win the trial, the ramifications for NASCAR could be severe. Not only would it likely owe damages, but it could be forced to significantly change its business model. If the court rules in favor of NASCAR, however, it could seek buyers for the charters that 23XI and Front Row declined to renew without making drastic changes.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Entering this week, Kentucky's best win on its résumé during the first month of the 2025-26 season came against Valparaiso, a team currently ",
    "body": "\n        Entering this week, Kentucky's best win on its résumé during the first month of the 2025-26 season came against Valparaiso, a team currently ranked No. 221 in the NET Rankings. In fact, all five of Kentucky's wins this season have come against opponents ranked in the lower half of the NET.From 10,000 feet, all four of Kentucky's losses -- including a 94-59 loss to No. 11 Gonzaga at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on Friday -- aren't a reason to go full-on panic mode, yet. Losing to Louisville, Michigan State, North Carolina and Gonzaga is not the end of the world when those teams are expected to be in the mix for the national title.However, peeling back the layers on the lack of production thus far from Kentucky's high-priced roster and factoring in the expectations for Year 2 of Mark Pope's tenure at his alma mater, you have an uncomfortable truth: The results, so far, aren't going to cut it.\"We have great young men and we're in a bad spot right now,\" Pope said.Gonzaga didn't just beat Kentucky in front of a pro-Wildcat crowd. It dominated from start to finish in one of the most impressive and shocking results of the season. Kentucky shot 5 of 31 from the floor (3 of 20 from the 3-point line) during the first half and didn't make its first field goal until nearly nine minutes into the game.\n\n        \n            \n                College basketball power rankings: Iowa State jumps to No. 2 heading into showdown at Purdue\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Wildcats missed their first 10 shots, which was the most consecutive misses to open a game for UK in the last eight seasons, per the ESPN broadcast. By the time the first half was over, Pope's team had made more free throws (seven) than field goals.The second half wasn't much better, either. Kentucky finished 16 of 60 (26.7%) from the floor and 7 of 34 (20.6%) from the 3-point line. The 26.7% from the floor marked Kentucky's worst shooting performance since 2006. The positive, if there is one, is that Kentucky did shoot better from the 3-point line in the last game against North Carolina, when Pope's team finished 1 of 13 from beyond the arc.Kentucky is now off to its worst start since the shortened 2020-21 season, when John Calipari's team started 1-6 before SEC play began. Before that, the last time Kentucky lost at least four games before SEC play started, you have to go back to the 2007-08 campaign, when the program started 6-7.\nAt a place like Kentucky, where results are measured in Final Four appearances and players selected in the first round of the NBA Draft, those numbers aren't going to cut it now or anytime soon.Kentucky caught lightning in a bottle during Pope's first season at the helm. Kentucky upset Duke in the Champions Classic, had an incredible comeback win over Gonzaga in Seattle and defeated Louisville at home with a roster that didn't include a single returning scholarship player. In fact, in Pope's first SEC game, Kentucky defeated eventual national champion Florida 106-100 in one of the most entertaining games of the year.\nGonzaga is going to be a team that plays deep into the NCAA Tournament, so there's no shame in Kentucky losing to them. The Bulldogs have the perfect recipe, led by star big man Graham Ike, to do some serious damage during the next few months. This game was just as important for Gonzaga's résumé, as Kentucky is currently the last-ranked team remaining on its schedule.\nKentucky still has plenty of chances for redemption, with games upcoming against No. 22 Indiana and No. 23 St. John's this month until the calendar flips to 2026. Kentucky also isn't playing at full strength. Star transfer Jayden Quaintance, a projected lottery pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, has yet to appear in a game this season, and his timeline to return is unclear after recovering from offseason ACL surgery.Earlier this week marked the end of the honeymoon phase for Pope at his alma mater. After this result, it might be time for some serious intervention before things go south quickly.\n            ",

And in Week 14, there are a whole bunch of games that could potentially affect what the playoff field looks like come January.We've already seen the Detroit Lions defeat the Dallas Cowboys to improve their own standing and damage that of the Cowboys, but on Sunday and Monday there are a number of games featuring two teams fighting for playoff spots. The Pittsburgh Steelers travel to Baltimore to take on the Ravens. The Jacksonville Jaguars host the Indianapolis Colts. The Chicago Bears take on the Green Bay Packers. The Kansas City Chiefs play the Houston Texans. And the Philadelphia Eagles do battle with the Los Angeles Chargers. \nEach of those matchups features two teams that are either currently in the playoff picture or sitting just outside of it. Amazingly, none of those teams -- even the teams sitting in first or second place in their respective conferences -- can clinch a spot in the playoffs this weekend. There's still more football to be played before that can happen. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: What Texans-Chiefs means for AFC seeding, wild-card chaos and teams on the bubble\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut there is also the other end of the spectrum to consider. There have so far been five teams eliminated from playoff contention: the New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, Las Vegas Raiders, New Orleans Saints and Arizona Cardinals will all be sitting at home once the new year rolls around. And there could potentially be several more teams eliminated from the possibility of making the postseason this weekend.\nHere's a look at the potential elimination scenarios in Week 14:Cleveland BrownsEliminated with a loss vs. TitansWashington CommandersEliminated with a loss/tie vs. Vikings OREagles win/tie vs. ChargersMinnesota VikingsEliminated with a loss vs. Commanders ORTie and Packers win/tie vs. BearsAtlanta FalconsEliminated with a loss vs. Seahawks ORTie and Buccaneers win/tie and Packers win/tieNew York JetsEliminated with a loss/tie vs. Dolphins ORTexans win vs. Chiefs and Bills win/tie vs. Bengals ORTexans win and Jaguars/Colts tie ORBills win/tie and Jaguars win/tie\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The wait is finally over. After a supersized 2026 FIFA World Cup draw that pushed broadcast windows to the limits, we now know the official teams and groups for next summer's tournament. The global event will be hosted in North America by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and begins on June 11. All draw predictions are now a thing of the past, and all the hypotheticals are faded into dust now that the draw is complete. The three hosts have some level of pressure on them, especially the U.S. men's national team, as the instant reaction is that they lucked into a favorable draw. What does the path look like for Mexico moving forward? Let's break down Group A:Mexico's World Cup opponents Group AMexicoSouth KoreaSouth AfricaThe winner of FIFA playoffs: Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, IrelandSo El Tri went ahead and found themselves in a puzzler of a group. Maybe they could be considered favorites in this one, but perhaps not.Mexico, having the honor of being one of the hosts, means that they were already honored with a bit of luck, being placed at the top of Group A. As a host nation, they were spared facing many of football's giants in Brazil and Argentina, or European titans in France and Spain, as a reward. However, it also means that it leaves more question marks about their form and how it could look against teams that could be considered underdogs. It's definitely not the group of death, but it's also not quite a group of life. \nEl Tri themselves in the group against South Korea, South Africa, and the eventual winner of the FIFA playoff winner D. The future winner means either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, or Ireland will join Group A for the 2026 World Cup. There are plenty of teams that will hold Mexico's hand down the tournament memory lane.The order of the draw means Mexico will host South Africa on June 11 as the first game of the 2026 World Cup. It's a throwback to the 2010 World Cup opener, where the two sides ended in a 1-1 draw, but these are different teams from back then. South Africa will arrive confident, fresh off AFCON, with an impressive goalkeeper in Ronwen Williams. It could be a bit of a trap game for Mexico as the first match of a group stage is often the most nervy and often difficult for even the group favorites (just ask Argentina). Whoever ends up winning the European playoff, this group will be difficult for El Tri. They have often struggled to get wins against European teams, despite the historic 2018 win against Germany, and they lost 4-2 to Switzerland earlier this year. \nDenmark, Ireland, and Czechia will be steadfast in their approaches as they'll be the final matchday competition, and that's where things always get spicy. Each are three programs that are no strangers to World Cups, with Denmark in more recent tournaments, while North Macedonia would be World Cup debutants, and it's always the newcomers who have the most to prove. So who could be the team to rival Mexico for a spot out of Group A?South Korea once againIf the home opener tests Mexico's tournament stomach, South Korea will be a battle of overall tactical quality. Not only did the two teams face each other to a 2-2 stalemate in September, but Mexico defeated South Korea 2-1 in the 2018 World Cup. The Taegeuk Warriors returned some of the favor in 2022 when they advanced to the knockouts from their respective group, while Mexico was eliminated in theirs. They are led by the iconic captain Son Heung-min, who now plays in the United States in MLS, and other European-based stars, including Kim Min-jae and Lee Kang-in.\nThey do not have to carry the burdens of home soil, and they might even have some home crowd favor, as Mexico is known for having a significant Korean population with several cultural hubs across Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Anything can happen, but this matchday two head-to-head could very well determine the first-place winner of the group. What's nextMexico will open the World Cup against South Africa on June 11, and five days later, face South Korea, before closing out the group stage against either Denmark, Ireland, Czechia, or North Macedonia. Ultimately, the draw was about as kind to Mexico as they could've hoped. Now they have to face the reality of their form. With six months in front of the World Cup, there is a path back toward the knockout rounds, a level they failed to reach in 2022.However, the pressures of playing at home and a nation begging for the team to rekindle belief in the squad, combined with the threat of three other ambitious opponents, mean El Tri can only go as far as they will take themselves. They now know the streets of the group stage; next will be to take the first steps of the journey. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. -- With the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, an increase in squads also means more restrictions on which teams could be drawn together. On the heels of a winter World Cup in 2022 in Qatar, followed by the Euros and both UEFA and Concacaf Nations Leagues taking place, the start of World Cup qualifying was pushed back, leading to the play-in games taking place during March of 2026 after the World Cup draw has already been completed.During the draw on Friday, when Uzbekistan were drawn, groups had to be skipped, causing some confusion. Putting the Asian side into Group K alongside Portugal, Colombia, and the winner of the Intercontinental Playoff 1 (DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia) was necessary. That's because putting them anywhere else would've potentially complicated things, resulting in a situation where there were two teams from the same confederation, which is not permitted, outside of UEFA. Because the playoff winners are not known, avoiding the possibility of having two teams from the same confederation had to be prevented.\nThe standard restrictions were in play that impact any World Cup. However, UEFA is required to have two groups of two of its teams due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament from Europe. But looking at the draw mechanics, the playoffs containing teams from multiple different confederations meant that restrictions had to be applied more than once.For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions were applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams. That already created limited chances, but with DR Congo, Jamaica, and New Caledonia representing CAF, Concacaf, and OFC, there was almost no other group that they could go into to further limit options.\nIf playoffs took place before the World Cup draw, that wouldn't be an issue, but in an expanded World Cup, new quirks are created. It's something that may be able to be smoothed out ahead of the 2030 World Cup, but it made for a moment where people didn't know where a team was going. It will take until the March international break for the full World Cup field to be known, but the picture is becoming clearer by the day.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        CBS will be the place to have your TV set on Saturday for college hoops. An incredible day of action kicks off at noon ET with No. 1 Purdue and No. 10 Purdue followed by another ranked-on-ranked tilt -- this one from Indiana, America -- as No. 6 Louisville faces No. 22 Indiana in Gainbridge Fieldhouse.The sixth-ranked Cardinals are coming off their first loss of the season on Wednesday on the road at Arkansas and looking to shake off the funk after getting blitzed on the boards and giving up countless second-chance opportunities. The 22nd-ranked Hoosiers, meanwhile, are out to prove they belong back among college basketball royalty after a hot start that has included wins over Marquette and Kansas State. They, too, are coming off their first loss earlier this week but will be back in familiar territory in a de facto home game that, officially, is being deemed a neutral site game. Where to watch Louisville vs. Indiana live  Date: Saturday, December 6 | Time: 2:15 p.m. ETLocation: Gainbridge Fieldhouse -- IndianapolisTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium    Louisville vs. Indiana: Need to knowComing off losses: Louisville opened its season 7-0 with wins over Kentucky and Cincinnati, among others, before its 89-80 loss Wednesday at Arkansas. The Cardinals trailed the entire game. Indiana also opened its season 7-0 and also lost its first game of the season Wednesday, 73-64 at Minnesota. The Hoosiers missed six of their seven final shots from the field in the loss and were on the losing side of the rebounding battle 40-25.\nStrength vs. strength: Louisville's mighty offense vs. Indiana's mighty defense could and should be the central plotline of this game and the major battle that decides this one. Louisville is scoring 125.4 points per 100 possessions, fourth nationally, with an offense that is among the most heavy 3-point attacks in the country. Indiana's no slouch itself on offense but it is its defense, which is top-10 in effective field goal percentage defense and top-five in 2-point percentage allowed, that has been its secret weapon. IU's defense is 17th in adjusted efficiency metrics at KenPom.Depth aplenty: Louisville has four players averaging double figures on the season led by Ryan Conwell and his 19.5 PPG average -- eclipsed by an even deeper top-half rotation by Indiana that has five players averaging double figures in scoring. IU's leading scorer Tucker DeVries (yes, coach Darian DeVries' son) leads the team at 16.8 PPG. He's one of two starters averaging 40% or better on 3-pointers this season.  Louisville vs. Indiana prediction, picks\nI was fully prepared to lay the points with Louisville as a narrow road favorite but 5.5 seems like a touch too high of a number for what is effectively an Indiana home game. This won't be an easy win for Louisville if it gets it, either, because this hot IU start is not some mirage. Hoosiers are very good and Darian DeVries can coach. I'm taking Louisville to win in a close one, but as far as the spread is concerned I'd take the points on the home dog. That 5.5 number is a lot. Pick: Indiana +5.5 -- Boone\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            LVILLE -5.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Indiana\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Indiana\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the top nonconference games of the 2025-26 college basketball season will take place Friday night in Nashville, Tennessee, when No. 11 Gonzaga take on No. 18 Kentucky at Bridgestone Arena. This will mark the fourth consecutive season that the programs have faced off, with Gonzaga owning a 2-1 advantage in the series. Last year's game was won by Kentucky (90-89) in overtime.Gonzaga is coming off a 40-point loss in the Players' Era Festival title game against No. 3 Michigan. Before that, the Bulldogs got off to a 7-0 start with wins over Creighton, Arizona State, Alabama and Maryland on their résumé. Entering this weekend, Kentucky is the final-ranked opponent (currently) remaining on Gonzaga's schedule.Year 2 of the Mark Pope era at Kentucky has gotten off to a bumpy start. The Wildcats are 5-3 with losses to Louisville, Michigan State and North Carolina. Those losses are nothing to sweat about in the long term, but the Wildcats haven't beaten an opponent ranked inside the top 200 of the NET.Here is everything you need to know ahead of the marquee matchup between Kentucky and Gonzaga.\n Where to watch Kentucky vs. Gonzaga live  Date: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Bridgestone Arena -- Nashville, TennesseeTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Kentucky vs. Gonzaga: Need to knowMark Pope's honeymoon has ended: My colleague David Cobb wrote an outstanding story about Pope and Kentucky after the Wildcats suffered a 67-64 loss to North Carolina in the ACC/SEC Challenge. As he wrote, that loss signaled the end of Pope's honeymoon phase with his alma mater, and that statement couldn't be more true. The Wildcats entered this season with one of the most expensive rosters in the sport, and so far, the results have been underwhelming. Of course, there is plenty of time to change the narrative, and what better way to start than defeating Gonzaga?Gonzaga has looked like one of the best team's in the country: Gonzaga suffered a shocking loss to Michigan last week, which marked its first of the season. Before that game, Gonzaga looked like one of the best five teams in the country. The Bulldogs opened the Players Era Festival with a statement win over Alabama and followed it up with a 39-point win over Maryland. All seven of Gonzaga's wins this season have come by double digits. This game could be one of Gonzaga's last chances to add another signature win to the résumé.\nKentucky's shooting regression is one to monitor: Part of what made Year 1 of the Pope era at Kentucky so successful was the 3-point team shooting. The Wildcats shot 37.5% from the 3-point line last year, which ranked No. 24 among all Division I teams. Through the first month of this season, the Wildcats rank No. 120 in that category (35.3%). In Kentucky's last game against North Carolina, it shot 1 of 13 from beyond the arc. That marked the fewest 3-point makes Kentucky had in a single game since the 2020-21 season. The key in this game is how well Kentucky shoots from outside the arc.Kentucky vs. Gonzaga prediction, picks\nKentucky has been a question mark this season. The Wildcats don't have a marquee win on their résumé yet, and a win over Gonzaga would certainly fit that bill. However, this matchup will be a tough one for Pope's squad. Gonzaga's blowout loss to Michigan doesn't do justice to how well it was playing during the first few weeks of the season. Unless Kentucky starts making shots from the 3-point line at a high clip like last year, I expect Gonzaga to come away with a win. Pick: Gonzaga -4.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            ZAGS -4.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Not only is the conference championship up for grabs on Friday night, but so, too, is a potential College Football Playoff berth as No. 20 Tulane hosts No. 24 North Texas in the American Championship Game. Both temas are led by departing coaches (Tulane's Jon Sumrall and North Texas' Eric Morris) who will continue to lead their respective programs through the end of the season, and neither wants this to be the final game for their headman before he exits for his new job.Considering where the American stands in the context of other Group of Five leagues, the longstanding assumption is that the league winner will be the fifth-highest ranked conference champion in the nation. With that designation comes an automatic bid in the CFP, likely as the No. 12 seed. And depending on what happens in the ACC, the victor could be held in even higher regard. Neither the Green Wave nor the Mean Green have ever played in the CFP, so history is on the table regardless of the result.The conference championship game is an on-campus affair in the American. Both teams went 7-1 in league play, but Tulane will host the title bout by virtue of being the highest-ranked American team in the Week 14 CFP Top 25. The Green Wave is unbeaten at home and posted the first 6-0 record in Yulman Stadium history.Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as Tulane battles North Texas in the 2025 American Championship Game on Friday. \nWhere to watch Tulane vs. North Texas liveDate: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Yulman Stadium -- New Orleans, LouisianaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Tulane vs. North Texas: Need to knowLame-duck coaches: Sumrall and Morris have had their hands full of late, balancing tasks at two different schools. Both were announced as incoming coaches at Power Four universities with Sumrall bound for Florida and Morris set to take over at Oklahoma State. But unlike some coaches on the 2025 carousel (looking at you, Lane Kiffin), their schools permitted them to remain with their respective teams through the end of the season. It is a unique wrinkle in this matchup that brings into question how focused the coaches will be on the task at hand and how motivated their players will be to suit up for coaches who are on their way out.Class of the American: Although it came away victorious just once (2022), Tulane reached the conference championship game each of the last three years and on Friday will become the first program in American history to play in four consecutive title games. The Green Wave is also 29-3 in regular-season conference games dating back to 2022, good for the best winning percentage (.906) of any team in the FBS. It is a stretch of dominance for the Green Wave that spans multiple coaching staffs, which indicates an immense amount of program strength and suggests it will be able to reload once Sumrall departs for Florida.\nMean Green offensive machine: If North Texas defeats the perennial conference title contender and wins its first American crown, it will almost certainly be because of its offense. Redshirt freshman quarterback Drew Mestemaker leads the nation in passing with 3,835 yards, true freshman running back Caleb Hawkins paces the sport in rushing touchdowns (23) and total touchdowns (26), sophomore wide receiver Wyatt Young ranks third nationally with 1,203 receiving yards and the team as a whole is the highest-scoring operation in the country at 46.8 points per game. The Mean Green put up at least 52 points in each of their final three regular-season games.Tulane vs. North Texas prediction, picks\nTulane is the more proven team against high-end competition. The Green Wave defeated a pair of Power Four opponents in Northwestern and Duke and did not lose to a team below .500. Meanwhile, let it not be forgotten that the last time (and only time) North Texas played a ranked team, it lost by 27 points to a conference foe in South Florida. While Mestemaker and his supporting cast could post a number that Tulane simply cannot match, the Green Wave is more battle-tested, familiar with the big stage and boasts home-field advantage. This might be a \"wrong team favored\" situation with Morris' unit laying a field goal on the road.

    "body": "\n        Purdue and Iowa State have made it their personal mission to dominate nonconference play. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, Purdue and Iowa State are a combined 99-9 against nonleague foes. That's the best two marks in the sport, and they both exited November without an L on the ledger.  That makes Saturday's tilt between No. 1 Purdue and No. 10 Iowa State a paradox unlike any other: unstoppable force meets immovable object between two undefeated teams who are built on retention.  Purdue retained its Big Three of Braden Smith, Trey Kaufman-Renn and Fletcher Loyer.  Iowa State retained its Big Three of Tamin Lipsey, Milan Momcilovic and Joshua Jefferson.  They play different ways, but Iowa State and Purdue share plenty of common ground.  \nOnly one will emerge unblemished, though.  Here is everything you need to know ahead of the marquee matchup.     Where to watch Purdue vs. Iowa State live    Date: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Mackey Arena -- West Lafayette, Indiana \tTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App  \tStreaming on Paramount+ Premium        Purdue vs. Iowa State: Need to know  Will Tamin Lipsey play?: That storyline is hanging over this top-10 duel. Lipsey suffered a nasty-looking leg injury late in regulation of Iowa State's victory over St. John's on Nov. 24. Less than two weeks later, Lipsey's status for Saturday's tilt is still up in the air, but he did practice on Friday, per CBS Sports' Jon Rothstein. Lipsey is one of the best point-of-attack defenders in the sport, and he had regained some of his offensive burst in the early-going. If he can suit up, we're in for a treat because Purdue's Braden Smith and Lipsey may be the best two point guards in America.  Joshua Jefferson versus Trey Kaufman-Renn is best on best: No high-major frontcourt player is averaging more assists than Joshua Jefferson (5.6 per game). He's fresh off back-to-back 10-assist showings in romps over Syracuse and Alcorn State, and Jefferson's assist rate has spiked all the way up to 28.3. Absolutely nutty stuff. How does Purdue take Jefferson away? Part of it could include making him work on the other end, defending Kaufman-Renn. The Purdue senior combines finesse with roaring power. Kaufman-Renn still has one of the best soft-touch push shots in the sport, but this year, he's become an utter madman on the glass against rival 4-men. But Jefferson isn't a slouch on the boards and craves physicality. The winner of this individual matchup could tilt the scales.   \nCorner treys incoming: Iowa State's havoc-wrecking pressure defense leads the entire country in turnover rate. They take the ball away better than anybody, but there are open corner 3-pointers to be found against the 'Clones if you can navigate the onslaught with smart big men. Kaufman-Renn is a willing playmaker and this could be a spot for \"Big Game Fletch\" to make another appearance. Fletcher Loyer is an utter deadeye this season, shooting over 49% from downtown. CJ Cox has drained 39% of his 28 3-point attempts. If Cox and Loyer are punishing this defense with corner treys, Iowa State is in hot water.    Purdue vs. Iowa State prediction, picks  \nIronically, Iowa State and Purdue were Oscar Cluff's two biggest suitors last spring in the transfer portal. Purdue won that recruiting battle, and Iowa State wisely pivoted to Virginia's Blake Buchanan, who has given the Cyclones plenty of good minutes this season. Lipsey (if he plays) versus Smith is the good stuff. Jefferson versus Kaufman-Renn is outstanding. But I wouldn't be surprised if the team who gets the best production from the 5-spot is the winner of this one. Can Buchanan stay out of foul trouble and keep Purdue off the glass? Can Cluff make wise decisions and score or distribute effectively?   In the past, Purdue has struggled with turnover-forcing defenses (Penn State comes to mind), but I think this group has more answers to the test this time around, especially since Cluff and Kaufman-Renn are sharp passers. Purdue has the bodies to throw at Jefferson, and Cox should be able to hang at the point of attack against Iowa State's guards. Milan Momcilovic has a real size advantage at the 3 for Iowa State. I wouldn't be surprised if there are some mid-post backdowns in the arsenal to hunt some of Purdue's smaller guards, but the Boilermakers' defense limits shots at the rim at a sky-high rate this season. If this turns into a jump-shooting contest, give me the home team. Iowa State is shooting a sizzling 43.3% from downtown this year (third-best in America), but I've seen way, way too many good-shooting teams walk into Mackey and miss jumpers to assume that will stick. Pick: Purdue -4.5  \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            PURDUE -4.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. – No matter the nation, no matter its potential and no matter its baggage, national teams gather six months before a World Cup hoping for a favorable draw. As a selection of the USA's most prominent athletes randomly picked one country after another out of a bowl, though, it was hard not to feel like the U.S. men's national team received some version of a best-case scenario. There were no quote-unquote hard teams to face in the group stage, the natural result of earning a Pot 1 berth as a host nation. They also happened to draw teams they have very valuable – and very recent – experience facing.First came Australia, the team they beat 2-1 in October. Then came Paraguay, the team they beat 2-1 in November. At the end came a twist – a little slip of paper with four teams' names on it, the quartet set to face off in a playoff in March for one of the few remaining tickets to the World Cup. Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo make up three-fourths of that group while the fourth is Turikye, a team the USMNT played in a 2-1 loss in June.\"I think we can go into it with a good feeling,\" Christian Pulisic said hours after the draw. \"Obviously, we've played against these teams recently, which is not always the case, so we know, more or less, what they're going to look like and we know they're tough opponents as well. We're not going to take anyone lightly. They're all going to be tough games but I think it's great that we have that experience. Obviously, they played against us, too, so they're in the same boat but it's cool. It's cool that those friendlies and some of the other ones were able to prepare us for some of the teams we're actually going to play.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 World Cup draw winners and losers: USMNT's Mauricio Pochettino a clear winner; Netherlands get tough draw\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nShould they face a familiar trio next summer, the group stage opponents perfectly serve as pinpoints for the team's progress in recent months as head coach Mauricio Pochettino finally morphs the team into his vision. One can almost pick out the 2-1 defeat in Connecticut against Turkiye as the exact point where things started to turn around for Pochettino's team – he had many fresh faces in the mix just before of the Concacaf Gold Cup, a month-long camp in which the head coach began to establish his principles. As games against Australia and Paraguay came along, Pochettino broke out varying versions of a back three that allowed the team to really shine and finish 2025 on a five-game unbeaten run.\n\"I think if you look at the friendly against Turkiye before Gold Cup, I think you saw a lot of fresh faces, also a lot of experience but also a lot of hunger,\" Chris Richards said. \"I think we still went toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in Europe and got unlucky with two goals but definitely goals that we could avoid. I think it gave us a lot of confidence going into the Gold Cup and I think after that, playing teams like Australia, who are one of the top teams in their division, again went toe-to-toe and beat them and then Paraguay, you saw the same thing so I think it just shows that form the summer, from friendlies, that you can still improve but also with new faces being added in, with new systems, with new play styles, things like that. It shows that we are very versatile and that we're also a very tough team to play, regardless of who steps on the pitch.\"The fact that there's a lot of roster turnover and several different playing styles for Pochettino to realistically choose from makes the USMNT a tricky opponent, even for those who feel they have a sense of familiarity.\"I think it's good to have some different options, obviously depending on opponents, depending on how we want to play, who's available and I think we've done a good job of that,\" Pulisic said. \"I think we've shown we can play a few different ways so for me, I see that as a positive and makes it tougher for them. They're not going to know what to expect.\"\nThere is one difference that sticks out above the rest, though – the fact that the World Cup is a series of now-or-never opportunities that friendlies simply cannot replicate.\"I think we are going to play in different contexts, different circumstances and of course, the timeline is different,\" Pochettino said. \"We are going to arrive with the same confidence or form. That is why. The good thing that we compete[d] against Paraguay and Australia in a very good way, again, very good teams and of course, [there is] Turkiye, [could] be, but there's another three that are going to challenge Turkiye, too … but I think it's good, the reference, because we are going to feel that we can beat them but at the same time, when you beat someone or when you hurt someone, they are waiting for you. They could say, 'but now we will see.' When it's going to be serious, it's going to be the World Cup. That is why. Caution. We need to be [cautious].\"In the aim of being cautious, the USMNT will naturally begin scouting their opposition as soon as possible but the quirk of a lengthy qualification campaign means there is plenty of work for Pochettino and company to do.\n\"The problem is rather [than] to have three teams to scout, we have two plus four because we need to scout the four,\" Pochettino said. \"From here to March, we are going to amplify the numbers of teams that we need to observe because now we have, of course, Australia and Paraguay but we need to add another four teams, be prepared, all the analysts and to start to work now because we cannot wait until March and then start to work, no? We need to be ready from now.\"Pochettino was also surprisingly emotional about the fact that do-or-die moments do not exist solely for teams as a whole at World Cups, but for every individual that takes part in one.\"My dream always was to play in the World Cup, to play for my national team, Argentina, and be involved in a World Cup,\" he said. \"In some moments in my career, I was thinking it's not going to happen but [then] it happened and [at] 31 years old, I had the possibility to play at the World Cup and it disappeared so quick. I don't think that I [didn't] do everything and I didn't do enough with the possibility to do better but it's true that through my experience, because after that, I suffer a massive depression because it's like your biggest dream disappeared and then you feel that [there's] not going to be another possibility to be involved in this and that, for me, is the most powerful energy that I want to translate to the people, to the players. Please, do everything that you [can]. Be humble enough and try to build, with your teammates, a good energy, a good dynamic.\"\nCaution or not, the draw has provided the perfect foundation for the USMNT to pull off the groundbreaking performance they have always targeted next summer in the hopes of further accelerating the growth of soccer in a country that has been slow to embrace the world's most popular sport. There are officially no excuses they can pull from, especially as things trend in the right direction for them with a year-ending unbeaten streak. The onus is well and truly on the World Cup hosts to well and truly live up to the potential many had spotted in them years earlier.\"Potentially, we've played all three of these teams in the last six months but that can be a little bit of a false kind of sense of security,\" Tim Ream said. \"We need to make sure that we're preventing that kind of security and safety feeling from setting in and we have enough guys with enough experience who know how to keep pushing, keep pushing each other and keep pushing the team in the right direction knowing what we could possibly do but again, it's down to us and our work and our intensity and our focus.\"\n            ",

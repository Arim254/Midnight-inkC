    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Los Angeles Angels and third baseman Anthony Rendon are in talks to buy out the final year of his contract (valued at $38 million), according to ESPN. Rendon, who missed the entire 2025 season after undergoing hip surgery in February, is expected to retire if a deal can be reached.Rendon, 35, agreed to a seven-year pact worth $245 million after winning the 2019 World Series as a member of the Washington Nationals. At the time, he was rightly viewed as one of the best at his position. In the preceding four seasons, he had averaged 26 home runs, 100 runs batted in, and a .912 OPS. His contributions had been worth an estimated 22.9 Wins Above Replacement, per the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\nYet that version of Rendon rarely showed up for the Angels, instead dealing with constant injuries that, in recent years, required operations on both hips. To wit, Rendon had notched just 3.9 WAR in 257 games since joining the Angels. That works out to fewer than 43 games per campaign (though, to be fair, he did appear 52 of the Angels' 60 games during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season). \nAngels general manager Perry Minasian revealed in October that Rendon had yet to resume baseball activities -- a less-than-promising sign for his chances of returning to the active roster.ESPN's report indicates that if the Angels and Rendon can agree to terms on a buyout, part of the arrangement is expected to see him defer some of the money owed to him. That would, in turn, create additional financial flexibility for the Angels to deploy this winter.\nIn Rendon's absence last season, the Angels started Yoán Moncada and Luis Rengifo more than 50 times apiece at the hot corner. Both Moncada and Rengifo are now free agents. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said he's \"really angry with the players\" following the team's 4-1 defeat to PSV in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday, a loss that extends their losing streak to three games and was their fifth in their last seven matches across all competitions.In the Reds' latest defeat, they were dominant with 63.1% possession and outshot PSV 27-9 but a look beneath the surface reveals a series of problems that have plagued the Premier League champions all season. The combination of their inefficient attack and their vulnerable defense meant they were essentially even on expected goals with the visitors, barely edging them out by a margin of 2.76 to 2.22. Liverpool's imperfections only exacerbated things, leading to yet another lopsided loss in a string of them.Pressure has begun to mount on manager Arne Slot, who has yet to find a solution to his problems but Carragher does not want to call time on his stint in charge of the team.\"LIverpool's not a sacking club,\" Carragher said during the UEFA Champions League Today post-match show. \"Liverpool, I think, are different from almost every club in European football where the manager is the king. The managers get time. Liverpool have never sacked a manager who's won the league. Never in the history. They all go after a few years. They've gone, they've resigned. I couldn't believe at the weekend that people were talking about the manager's job when I spoke to Liverpool supporters after losing at home to Nottingham Forest. It's only going to amplify now and I've always been in the camp of you stick with the manager.\"\nCarragher believes the problem is bigger than the manager, Liverpool's defeats the result of the club's inability to evolve after Jurgen Klopp's refresh of the team before they won the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League the following season.\"I think what you see now is Liverpool in 2018 under Klopp starts this sort of journey of being a great team and then Slot comes in and we're now, what are we, seven or eight years later?,\" Carragher said. \"The catalyst for Liverpool at the very start of that run was Alisson, [Virgil] van Dijk and [Mohamed] Salah. Alisson's injured a lot, now he doesn't play so much but you're watching van Dijk now, not the same player and Mo Salah looks like his legs have gone.\"Carragher has felt criticism of Salah and Van Dijk this season has been harsh, shifting his focus to their teammates who have not stepped up as the veterans enter their post-peak years.\n\"I'm angry with the players, if I'm being totally honest. I'm really angry with the players,\" Carragher said. \"I've been critical of Mo Salah off the pitch. I want him to come out and do an interview tonight and speak to the Liverpool players about what the players are going to do, what's going on in the dressing room, giving the supporters hope that things are going to improve but I don't like criticizing them on the pitch because they're absolute legendary, what they've done and the legs have just gone, especially with Salah. Van Dijk now can't help other players. He needs help himself and that just means he's a normal center back like I was at one stage. Maybe he's not superhuman now but they've been that good for the football club. I look at some of the others – step up. Can you only play well when they play well? Their seasons last season were off the scale and everybody else enjoyed that, winning the league and they're all league champions and they've got it on the CV and great but when they're not there, where are they? Where are the others?\"Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones took a similar tone in a post-match interview with broadcasters, regretting the fact that trips to Anfield feel approachable for opposing teams these days.\"This starts with just wanting to be a man out there and you're just wanting to tackle someone and just be a dog out there and it's not always the fact that we've got these lads who are nice on the ball and we just play and play and play,\" Jones said. \"Like, go and smash someone and it's coming from me, as well. I'm not saying the other lads have to go out and do it because I'm the same. I'm in the exact same boat that the lads are looking at me as well say, 'Go on, then. Smash someone,' so it's got to be on me and the rest of the lads to change this around, to not be so nice where teams are coming here thinking, 'I'm going to win here. We're going to score two, three, four goals.' You come in here and this used to be a place that you hated to come, with the fans, with how we played and how we go and press and we're just absolute dogs and then we have the ball and then we play whereas now, we hardly even play. There's times when we play but off the ball stuff, I think that's the stuff that has to change.\"\nCarragher took his argument one step further, though, making the case that Liverpool's squad as a whole may not be equipped to challenge for titles on the regular – and may not have been last season, either.\"In terms of the players and the way they are performing now, that is not acceptable for Liverpool Football Club and I actually think – and maybe I thought this last season,\" Carragher said. \"Are some of them good enough for Liverpool if Liverpool want to win the biggest trophies? We saw them at Newcastle [United] in the Carabao Cup. We saw them against [Paris Saint-Germain] away from home last season. I mean, woeful performances and they've been carried by some of the greatest players the club have ever had. This is maybe a snapshot of the future of Liverpool when Mo Salah moves on, when Virgil van Dijk moves on and Alisson moves on.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Davis has been sidelined for nearly a month with a calf strain, but a return could come as soon as this weekend after he practiced Wednesday with the Dallas Mavericks. It will be a major boost for a Mavericks team that has gone 3-11 in Davis' absence, but whenever the All-Star forward returns, he'll be rejoining a team with far different expectations than the one that he was on when the season started.In the middle of Davis' absence, the Mavericks fired general manager Nico Harrison, the man who was responsible for orchestrating the trade that sent Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for bringing Davis to Dallas. It ended a tumultuous tenure for Harrison, who was consistently booed at home games with chants of \"Fire Nico\" raining down on him every chance the fans got. Though none of that ire was thrown Davis' way, he will always be the guy that cost the Mavericks their beloved superstar, as Harrison had long admired Davis and specifically wanted to bring him to Dallas.In his first public comments about Harrison since his dismissal, Davis said he was stunned by his firing.\"It was surprising more than anything,\" Davis said. \"Nico's my guy, obviously he played a huge part in getting me here and wanting me to fulfill his vision in a sense. It was definitely tough. Me and him had a conversation. Me and [Mavericks governor] Patrick [Dumont] had a conversation. It's the business of basketball.\"\nWith Harrison ousted, that immediately brings Davis' status with the team into question. Without the man that so badly wanted him in a Mavericks jersey in charge anymore, that allows the possibility of Davis potentially being a trade candidate before the February deadline. It's already been reported that the Mavericks are expected to explore the trade market for Davis, though actually getting a deal done may be difficult given his robust contract that pays him in total $121.2 million over the next two years, including a $62.7 million player option in 2027.With rookie Cooper Flagg considered the future of this franchise after the Mavericks lucked into the No. 1 pick last June, it's probably best for both the Mavericks and Davis to part ways. Davis is 32 years old and would be better served playing on a championship contender. From now until the trade deadline on Feb. 5, trade rumors will circulate about him, though it's not the first time he's dealt with that type of cloud hovering over him.\"Man look, ya'll make it like we're going to war or something,\" Davis said when asked about how trade rumors affect him. \"This is basketball, it comes with it. I think everybody in their career has been involved in trade talks, been traded or some type of move. That doesn't affect me. I've been in trade talks for awhile. My job is to do what I do when I'm on the floor, play basketball and try to lead this team. Whatever comes out of that, comes out of that. I don't really have any control over that. But I do have an open line of communication with the front office, and I'm just ready to get back on the floor.\"\nDavis practiced on Wednesday with the hopes that he'll be ready to play in one of Dallas two back-to-back games against the Lakers on Friday and Clippers on Saturday. Obviously there will plenty of attention surrounding the Lakers matchup, as it will pit Davis and Dončić against their former teams. If it were up to Davis, he'd be playing on Friday.\"You know what game I want to play,\" Davis said when asked if there was a preference to which game he wanted to make his return for. \"But we'll see, we'll have a conversation and see what makes the most sense with the medical and coaching staff. Obviously I would like to [play against the Lakers] but at the end of the day, the main thing is getting back on the floor, whether that's Friday or Saturday.\"The Mavericks were 2-3 when Davis was on the floor, but several adjustments have been made to the starting lineup since he's been sidelined. The hair-brained scheme to have Flagg start at point guard despite no prior experience at the position has been put to rest. Klay Thompson has been primarily moved to a bench role, and while the frontcourt is still banged up with Dereck Lively II now expected to miss extended time, Daniel Gafford can fill the center position with Davis at the power forward spot.\nIt's still an imperfect roster, and Davis certainly isn't a perfect antidote for every issue that ails this team. But having him healthy will make things easier on everyone else on both ends of the floor. And from a trade perspective, the Mavericks need Davis to be healthy in order to build back his trade value, and if he wants to get to a championship-contending team, it should also be his goal to return to All-Star status.\n            ",

    "body": "\nEthan Dietz, a basketball player at Connors State College in Warner, Oklahoma, died Tuesday, three days after sustaining an injury in the second half of his team's game against Grayson College. Specifics about the injury were not disclosed in the school's announcement, but a Connors State spokesperson told multiple outlets that Dietz, 20, suffered a head injury in the game. \"The Cowboy family has suffered an unimaginable loss,\" the school said in a statement. \"As you know, sophomore Ethan Dietz was injured during a men's basketball game on Saturday. He passed away this morning, November 25. Ethan exemplified what it means to be a Cowboy, to value hard work and being part of a team. While the team and the Cowboy community are processing our own grief, our hearts go out to his family and friends.\"\nDietz, a sophomore from Conway, Arkansas, played 20 minutes in Saturday's game prior to his injury and scored six points and had four rebounds. The 6-foot-8 forward was a starter for the Cowboys who averaged 11 points and 9.4 rebounds per game on the season. Dietz also started 29 of the Cowboys' 36 games last year as a freshman.\"Ethan Dietz was the kind of player a coach always hopes for,\" Connors State coach and athletic director Bill Muse said. \"He was talented athletically and academically and he understood the importance of hard work. If you ever saw him smile, you knew he was all heart. He was a person of character as well as a great teammate. Our hearts and prayers continue to be with Ethan's family, friends and our team as we process this heartbreaking loss.\"Connors State canceled its upcoming games against Southern Arkansas University Tech on Wednesday, Nov. 26, and against Grayson College on Monday, Dec. 1, in the wake of the tragedy. The women's basketball team also canceled its next two games.\"It is devastating when such a bright light is taken from us,\" Connors State president Dr. Ron Ramming said. \"Ethan exemplified what it means to be a Cowboy, to value hard work and being part of a team. While we are processing our own grief, our hearts go out to his family, friends and teammates.\"Connors State will hold an on-campus vigil in Dietz's honor on Monday, Dec. 1, at 7 p.m.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA is in the midst of a cycle of coaching upheaval. Since the end of the 2023 season, 13 of the now 15 WNBA franchises have hired a new head coach. Eight of those jobs have gone to men, only two have gone to former WNBA players and zero have gone to Black women.In 2025, Noelle Quinn was one of four former WNBA players to serve as a head coach and the lone Black female coach. With the Seattle Storm choosing not to renew Quinn's contract, no Black woman is currently a head coach of a WNBA team, and barring a drastic offseason shakeup, that will be the case at the start of the 2026 season. That would make 2026 just the third season in WNBA history to tip off without a Black woman at the helm, joining 2006 and 2020. While Natalie Nakase, who is headed into her second season leading the expansion Golden State Valkyries, and Sonia Raman, the newly-hired Seattle Storm coach, are both women of Asian descent, the absence of Black women coaches in a league where Black women account for over half the player pool is jarring. \n\"When you look at 63.8% of all players identifying as Black or African-American, and you don't have that reflected in the coaching staff, there's an issue. There's a problem,\" Alicia Jay said on the latest episode of CBS Sports podcast We Need To Talk Now. \nAs the league continues to grow and evolve, why does it seem like retired players — especially the Black women who make up the majority of the league — are being left behind?The WNBA is changing, on the court and offBusiness and tactical changes to the nearly 30-year-old league are contributing to the drastic coaching turnover. As college stars like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers transition into the pro game, with them comes more viewership, attendance, and media coverage. On the court, the spike in versatile and elite-level talent means tougher competition. As parity in the league grows, it becomes harder to win. Teams want coaches who can win now. Gone may be the days of a coach remaining with one franchise for 16 seasons, as is the case with Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve. \n\"This league is different than just a couple of years ago, let alone that long ago,\" New York Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said in September while addressing the decision to part ways with Sandy Brondello. \"This decision comes after a thorough examination of what the New York Liberty need as we move forward into a future of an ever-evolving WNBA,\" Kolb added. Brondello, who became the winningest coach in Liberty history en route to the franchise's first WNBA title in 2024, was no longer the competitive edge the organization needed. The Liberty have since reportedly hired Chris DeMarco, a former NBA assistant coach and first-time head coach, to usher the 2024 champions into the next era of New York basketball. DeMarco is part of a growing trend: Right now, seven of the 15 WNBA head coaches have spent at least one year as an assistant coach in the NBA.\nNBA assistants are flooding to the WNBAPart of the reason NBA coaches may be desired hires in the WNBA is because of the shift in the game. As the emphasis on positionless basketball increases, so too does the need for players to continue to improve their individual games. In the WNBA, players like center Jonquel Jones are shooting from the perimeter and wings like Satou Sabally can take defenders off the dribble. Coaching staffs need to be able to develop a dynamic game plan to adjust to the new style of play. Player development roles, which have been commonplace in the NBA for years, are beginning to migrate to WNBA staffs. Additionally, the WNBA expanding to 18 teams by 2030 means there will be more head coaching roles available. As ESPN analyst and 2014 No. 1 overall draft pick Chiney Ogwumike recently noted on social media, there are more NBA coaching jobs (including assistants) than there are WNBA players at the moment, and the NBA tends to recycle former head coaches rather than provide opportunities to assistants. \n\"Getting a promotion to head coach in the NBA, especially with how they recycle respected names, probably seems really difficult, nearly impossible,\" Ogwumike said.So, NBA assistants looking for a chance to run their own team might be more enticed to take a leap to the WNBA — especially now that WNBA coaching salaries are trending into seven figures. \"You know what they say? Money talks. With coaches now making well over a million dollars, the WNBA is now becoming a destination for opportunity,\" Ogwumike said. \nWhile the increase in salaries and status might account for NBA talent seeking WNBA roles, it doesn't explain why former WNBA players aren't getting opportunities to lead in the league they helped build. Reports indicate former WNBA players such as Kristi Toliver and Lindsay Harding were up for vacant roles this season, but clearly, they didn't get hired.\"It's getting increasingly hard for aspiring coaches or even former players to win from within,\" Ogwumike said, shouting out players-turned-coaches like Briann January, Karima Christmas-Kelly, Toliver and Harding. A clog in the pipelineIronically, the trend of NBA assistant coaches jumping to the WNBA was jump-started by six-time WNBA All-Star Becky Hammon.\nHammon has only been with the Las Vegas Aces for four seasons, but she is already the second-longest tenured WNBA head coach, trailing only Reeve's 16. Previously, she was a trailblazer for women coaches in the NBA; she spent seven seasons as an NBA assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs.So, when Hammon had instant success at the WNBA level, coaching the Aces to three titles in her first four years at the helm, it made sense that WNBA front offices started looking for other coaches with NBA experience. While Hammon was just the second woman to be an assistant coach in the WNBA, she was far from the last. By 2020, 11 women were actively serving as NBA assistant coaches. Many of those were Black women. But quietly, in the past couple of years, the number of women on the sidelines in the NBA has decreased. It is hard to find exact numbers due to the fact that every NBA team configures their coaching staffs differently and assistant coaches are regularly changing jobs, even within season, but right now it seems there are less than five women serving as assistant coaches in the NBA, including Harding with the Los Angeles Lakers, Jenny Boucek with the Indiana Pacers and Mery Andrade with the Toronto Raptors.\nSo, as the hiring of NBA assistants is becoming more prevalent, very few women are getting the opportunity to hold those positions and gain that necessary experience. And, as male coaches continue to gain power in the WNBA, it seems we are no closer to seeing a woman break through as a head coach in the NBA. South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley recently said she doesn't foresee a female NBA head coach in her lifetime.Unrivaled provides a blueprintThe women's basketball startup Unrivaled seems to have found a balance between hiring coaches with NBA experience, player development backgrounds and Black women. \"I think it's powerful that there are five black women leading, there are five black women head coaches in this Unrivaled league. It's not by accident. I believe it's intentional,\" Quinn said during an Unrivaled media availability this week. \nQuinn, Rena Wakama and Roneeka Hodges are new to the league and join returning Black women coaches Teresa Weatherspoon and Nola Henry, who squared off in the inaugural Unrivaled championship last season. Weatherspoon returns to Vinyl BC after being let go by the Chicago Sky after just one season as a head coach. She was replaced by former Las Vegas Aces assistant Tyler Marsh, a first-time head coach who recorded a 10-34 record and last-place finish. Despite posting a worse record and reports of issues with star player Angel Reese, Marsh was not one of the three coaches let go after the 2025 offseason. \"Representation is possible when leadership chooses to make it possible,\" Quinn said. \"So I'm just blessed to be a part of the league standing on intentionality behind diversity and hiring women, women of color and I give kudos to Unrivaled for leading the way now.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There have been plenty of times in recent college football history where a rivalry is created out of thin air and foisted upon fan bases as a real thing. That could've been the case when Nebraska joined the Big Ten and needed a new team to play on Black Friday after spending the previous two decades facing Oklahoma or Colorado.Iowa seemed a natural choice, but the Hawkeyes had other traditional rivals in the Big Ten, so nothing was guaranteed.Well, here we are, 15 years later, and there's very little pretending still being done. These fan bases are going after each other all year long, and some on both sides might even tell you they dislike the other more than their other older, traditional rivals. Both teams enter the game licking some wounds. Iowa was a playoff contender a few weeks ago, but close losses to Oregon and USC ended those hopes. Nebraska had a shot too before quarterback Dylan Raiola broke his leg.Now they enter the final week of the regular season with one thing in mind: ruin the other's Thanksgiving weekend.\nIowa vs. Nebraska: Need to know  Iowa has controlled the Big Ten rivalry: These two played plenty of times before sharing a conference, and Nebraska leads the all-time series 30-22-3. However, Nebraska's lead was much larger before it entered the Big Ten. Nebraska won the first two meetings in 2011 and 2012, but Iowa's taken 10 of 12 since, including the last two. Iowa has also won six straight meetings at Memorial Stadium.  Iowa loves November: The Hawkeyes lost their first two games in November this season, which is a rarity for them. Those losses dropped their record in the month to 19-4 since the 2020 season. It's the fourth-highest win percentage among FBS teams in that time.  Nebraska looking to end a nearly decade-long drought: If the Cornhuskers get the win here it'll give them a record of 8-4 on the season. That's a big deal because it would be the first time the Huskers won eight games in a season since 2016. It would also be the first time they won five Big Ten games since that same season when they finished 6-3 in conference play.\n  Where to watch Iowa vs. Nebraska live  Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Memorial Stadium -- Lincoln, NebraskaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ PremiumIowa vs. Nebraska prediction, picks\nWe throw out the record books in rivalry games like this because anything can happen, so I'm not sure who will win, or who will cover. However, I don't expect there to be a lot of points scored in this one. It's going to be cold at Memorial Stadium, and with TJ Lateef at QB for the Cornhuskers now, this team has leaned heavily on its rushing attack. Iowa's been a run-heavy team all year. Unless we see a lot of explosive rushing plays (not out of question) or numerous defensive and special teams scores (also not out of the question!), I don't think either offense does enough to put a lot of points on the board. After all, the last two meetings have finished with 13-10 scores.  Pick: Under 38.5Who will win and cover in each Week 14 college football rivalry game?

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- As Tyrese Maxey walked out of the visitor's locker room at Fiserv Forum late on Nov. 20, game ball in hand after scoring a career-high 54 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 123-114 overtime win over the Milwaukee Bucks, he bragged about receiving a text from Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards. \"'Filthy bastard,'\" Maxey said Edwards wrote. None of the main characters in Milwaukee that night could match Edwards' candor, but they all expressed the same sentiment. Sixers coach Nick Nurse said Maxey is \"just really talented\" and Paul George called him \"special.\" Rookie of the Year candidate VJ Edgecombe proclaimed that Maxey is the \"best point guard in the NBA.\"Whether you prefer the PG-13 description of Maxey or PG-13's, everyone agrees that the sixth-year pro is playing the best basketball of his career and has ascended to a new level. Maxey is averaging 32.2 points, 4.4 rebounds and 7.5 assists on 47/40.9/87.8 shooting splits, all while playing 39.9 minutes a night. He's second in the league in scoring, tied for second in 3-pointers, seventh in assists and first in minutes by a wide margin (Edgecombe is second at 37.4). The only other players in the top 10 in scoring and assists are MVP candidates Nikola Jokić and Luka Dončić.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA MVP rankings: Early look at top five in race and why SGA currently has edge over Nikola Jokić\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Maxey likely isn't going to win that award, he's worked his way into the conversation -- he currently has the sixth-best odds (+5000 at Caesars) -- which is a testament to the work he's done to carry the Sixers. No one knew what to expect in Philadelphia this season given the team's injury issues, but despite Joel Embiid being limited to six appearances, George having played three times and Kelly Oubre Jr. and Jared McCain both missing time, they are off to a 9-8 start, which has them in ninth place in the Eastern Conference and right in the mix for an automatic playoff berth. Ironically, Maxey credited an injury and the Sixers' disastrous 2024-25 campaign with helping him improve. He sat out of the team's final 22 games with a finger sprain, and they finished 24-58 to miss the playoffs for the first time since 2017. The extended break allowed Maxey to fully recover and get in better shape. He also had \"a lot of time to really focus on getting better\" and to be a \"student of the game.\" Together with his friend Jordan Harris, Maxey watched film \"every day\" over the summer. Maxey was no slouch prior to this season. He was named Most Improved Player of the Year and an All-Star in 2024, and was widely considered an All-Star snub in 2025. But what he's doing to start this campaign is off the charts. He's tied for second in the league in 40-point games (three) and tied for third in 30-point outings (nine). When he put up 54 points and nine assists against the Bucks, he joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in Sixers history with at least 50 points and nine assists in a game. \n\"He's got a unique double threat which is the speed, which will get him past people, and then the really deep shooting range, so there's a lot of space he's playing in there,\" Nurse said. Over 80% of Maxey's shot attempts have come either within 10 feet or from behind the 3-point line.Maxey's shooting has been particularly impressive no matter which way you slice it. Of the top 10 players in 3-point point attempts per game, only Grayson Allen is making a higher percentage than Maxey. Of the nine players who have taken at least 100 3s from 25-29 feet -- the NBA 3-point line is 23 feet, 9 inches from the basket at its furthest point -- Maxey's 39.4% clip ranks second. And of the 76 players taking at least four catch-and-shoot 3s per game, Maxey checks in fourth at 51.6%. NBA's best long-range shooters (25-29 feet)PlayerTeam3FGA3FG%Stephen CurryWarriors14738.8%Donovan MItchellCavaliers14338.5%Tyrese Maxey76ers13739.4%James HardenClippers13040.8%Trey Murphy IIIPelicans11934.5%Lauri MarkkanenJazz11136%Luka DončićLakers10834.3%Payton PritchardCeltics10530.5%Derrick WhiteCeltics10431.7%\"I remember early his first year, I made a comment to some of our media in Philadelphia and they thought I was nuts as usual,\" said Bucks coach Doc Rivers, who coached Maxey for three season in Philadelphia. \"I said 'Tyrese Maxey is a great shooter.' I think he was shooting 21% at the time, and I said 'I've never seen a guy make that many shots in practice and it not go in in the game.' Early on it wasn't. But if you were around him every day, you just know it. You sense it.\"The shots are certainly going in now. Overall, Maxey is at 40.9% on 9.6 attempts per game. In NBA history, the only players to shoot over 40% on at least nine attempts a night for an entire season are Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard and Malik Beasley. \"I don't shoot shots that I don't work on. I don't just try stuff,\" Maxey said. \"Every shot that I shoot is a shot that I worked on before, so I have confidence in it.\"\nWhen Maxey isn't pulling up from well behind the arc, he's blowing past opponents to get into the lane. His 14.9 drives per game rank 10th in the league, and his 5.6 restricted area attempts per game rank sixth among guards. When he gets to the rim, he's shooting 62.1%, a highly respectable mark considering he stands just 6-foot-2. Now the top name on the opponent scouting report, Maxey has to adjust his game-to-game approach depending on what's being thrown at him. \"I've seen a lot of different things, like a lot,\" Maxey said. \"The ball went up for the tip in Toronto, I was getting face-guarded immediately. I've been trapped, I've seen blitzes.\" The only coverage that's worked to any degree is selling out to eliminate him as a scorer, as the Orlando Magic did in a blowout win Tuesday when they held Maxey to a season-low 20 points and 15 shots -- eight below his season average. Maxey has responded to the increased attention by being a willing passer. His 73.4 passes per game are second in the league, and his assists per game (7.8) and assist rate (32.5%) are both career-highs. Despite having to make so many decisions every night, Maxey has limited his mistakes. He's one of just five players in the league with a usage rate of at least 29% and a turnover rate below 10% (min. 10 games played). The big question is whether Maxey can keep this up, especially if Embiid and George are not going to play on a regular basis. \"He might not want to say it, but I know he's tired, he's gotta be tired,\" George said. Maxey hasn't missed a game this season despite some bumps and bruises, and has played at least 30 minutes every night. He's been above 40 minutes eight times and surpassed 45 minutes twice. Nurse has always leaned heavily on his stars, and while there have been some opportunities to get Maxey some rest -- Why was he still playing down 40 in the third quarter against the Magic? -- the Sixers fall apart when Maxey sits. They have a plus-2.8 net rating when he's on the floor and a minus-11.6 net rating when he sits. \"It's evident how much we need him,\" Nurse told The Athletic earlier this month. \"The minutes are going to be there. They are going to be at around 40. He's got to carry the load. That's what we ask him to do, and he's figured it out.\"The single-minded Maxey remains unfazed by the discussion.  \"If I can run, I'm playing, Maxey said. \"I don't really care, I just want to win. However much I have to play to win, that's what I'm gonna do. The Sixers have asked Maxey to do it all, and he's answered the bell. The rest of the league is now on full alert. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's no more maneuvering either side. No. 4 Georgia and No. 23 Georgia Tech know exactly where they stand in their respective conference championship races, which makes Friday's meeting in Atlanta less about postseason paths and more about something simpler: taking a swing at your rival. Georgia can still tighten its grip on a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff, a margin that could matter in December. Georgia Tech doesn't have that luxury -- even a win here likely won't push the Yellow Jackets into at-large range, leaving the ACC title game as their only real doorway into the 12-team bracket.  What this matchup does offer is history, and plenty of it. The 119th edition of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate marks just the third time in series history that both teams enter the rivalry with at least nine wins. The last time these two sides met, they played one of the wildest games of the 2024 season: an eight-overtime marathon in Athens that ended 44-42 and reset the bar for chaos in a rivalry that rarely needs help generating it.Now they get a neutral-site stage at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta with a chance to settle something that analytics and résumés can't. This one is about bragging rights, plain and simple.  Georgia vs. Georgia Tech: Need to know  Heisman-caliber QBs: While a trip to New York for either seems unlikely at this point, Georgia's Gunner Stockton and Georgia Tech's Haynes King are the engines of two high-powered offenses. Both have accounted for 27 total touchdowns this season, tied for 18th among all FBS players. King's dual-threat ability stands out, averaging 339.9 total yards per game -- second-most in FBS -- while Stockton has been equally efficient through the air. Both quarterbacks rank in the top 10 nationally in completion percentage, with King at 71.8% and Stockton at 71.4%, making them two of the most productive and precise signal-callers in the country.Dominant Dawgs: Since 2021, Georgia has gone 63-6, capturing back-to-back CFP national titles and two SEC championships along the way. Under Kirby Smart, the Bulldogs are 42-3 against nonconference opponents and have won seven straight against Georgia Tech. A victory Friday would extend that streak to eight, tying the Yellow Jackets' longest uninterrupted run in the series from 1949-1956.\nWandering eyes: Friday's result won't change the conference races -- Georgia already has its SEC path mostly set, while Georgia Tech's ACC title hopes hinge on a complex chain of other results. For the Bulldogs, a win simply allows them to turn their focus to the SEC title game and the College Football Playoff, hoping for a loss from either Alabama or Texas A&M to secure a return trip to Atlanta next week. For the Yellow Jackets, the path is far trickier: scenarios include a Pittsburgh win plus SMU and Virginia losses, OR a Miami victory combined with Duke, NC State, SMU and Virginia losses.

The Bulldogs' defense has been dominant against Power Four opponents over the last three contests, allowing just 17 points per game and 3.11 yards per carry.

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas hosts No. 3 Texas A&M in a fierce rivalry game at Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin. The Longhorns try to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive after moving to 8-3 after a dynamic victory against Arkansas. Texas A&M has blazed out to a historic 11-0 start for the first time since 1992. The last time the Aggies won 10 games was 2012, the year Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy. In their most recent SEC game, Texas A&M overcame a 30-3 halftime deficit to shock South Carolina 31-30 to stay unbeaten and virtually clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. Texas has not hosted this rivalry game since 2010, a 24-17 victory for Texas A&M. However, the Longhorns took down the Aggies 17-7 in the return of the rivalry last year at Kyle Field. Emotions will be high for the return to Austin.   Texas vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  Breakout pass rusher: Texas A&M lost multiple defensive linemen to the NFL last season. However, Cashius Howell has stepped up and emerged as one of the best in the sport. The former Bowling Green transfer was a rotation player last season, but has since emerged to lead the SEC with 11.5 sacks. Amazingly, he has recorded a sack in seven of his eight Power Four games. Against a Texas offensive line dealing with major issues, Howell can change the game. Resurgent Arch: Texas quarterback Arch Manning had a slow start to the year as he acclimated to the job of being QB1, but has found his footing in the second half of the year. Manning now has four straight games of completing more than 60% of his passes with 13 touchdowns to only two interceptions. Texas is 3-1 in those games. Against Arkansas, he became the first Texas QB to score touchdowns via pass, rush and receiving in one game. Texas A&M will be a substantially tougher challenge, but Manning is playing his best ball. \nStrength on weakness: Despite coming into the year with a highly-rated defense, Texas' secondary has been a major liability. In SEC play, the Longhorns rank last in the conference in passing defense, surrendering more than 295 yards per game. Over the last four games, they're giving up 325 passing yards per game. Texas A&M boasts the SEC's best receiving corps behind standouts Mario Craver and KC Concepcion. The Longhorns will have their hands full.   Where to watch Texas vs. Texas A&M live  Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Location: Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium -- Austin, Texas  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Texas vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  From a matchup perspective, Texas A&M clearly has the upper hand. Their passing offense will gave Texas' defense fits. Top pass rusher Cashius Howell is a matchup nightmare against an inconsistent Longhorns offensive line. Even their special teams has created opportunities. But in a rivalry game of this magnitude, it will be a mental game above all. Mike Elko's squad has stepped up in the biggest moments, and they will do the same to clinch their first spot in the SEC Championship Game and finish 12-0. Pick: Texas A&M -2.5\n\n

    "body": "\n        It's Thanksgiving week, so grab some turkey, get a tub of cranberry sauce and let's get ready to make some picks. Actually, I don't even like turkey and cranberry sauce is the worst, so I take back everything I just said. When it comes to Thanksgiving, I only eat three things: Pumpkin pie, apple pie and grapes, but the grapes have preferably been fermented and turned into wine by the time they get to me. I'm not sure how many glasses of wine I'll be having on Thursday, but I do know how many football games I'll be watching: THREE. Normally, that number is closer to two, because I usually nap during at least one game, but there will be no napping this year because the schedule is too loaded. As we head into Thanksgiving, almost every fan base has something to be thankful for and that's the fact that 31 of the 32 NFL teams are still mathematically alive for the playoffs. Even the 1-10 Titans could still get in. On the other hand, if you're celebrating Thanksgiving with a Giants fan, please give them a hug, because their team is the only one that's been eliminated from playoff contention so far. I don't want to make Giants fans sadder than they already are, so let's just get to the picks. \n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 13 NFL picks: Jordan Love leads Packers over Lions, Chiefs top Cowboys in high-scoring game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nActually, before we get to the Week 13 picks, here's a quick reminder that you can check out the weekly picks from every CBSSports.com NFL expert by clicking here.

Based on my math, that gives you two hours to eat, then you can take another 30 minutes for dessert, and then take a one hour nap so that you'll be ready to roll by the time this game kicks off at 1 p.m. ET. And if you need something to be thankful for, we can all thank Roger Goodell for moving the kickoff time of the first game from 12:30 p.m. ET to 1 p.m. ET this year. It's a small change, but that's 30 extra minutes of eating pumpkin pie. \nTo me, this game feels like the unofficial NFC North title game. Yes, I know the Bears are actually in first place, but their schedule is a ticking time bomb. Over their final six games, they play five teams that currently have seven wins or more. Their only \"easy\" game is against the Browns, a team that might sack Caleb Williams 19 times. The Bears might make the playoffs as a wild card team, but I don't think they're going to win the division, which leaves us with the winner of this game. The Lions are favored to win, but I think that's only because the oddsmakers were taking shots of potato vodka before setting the point spread. Potato vodka is the perfect Thanksgiving drink, but it's not good for setting point spreads. My problem with the Lions is that they are playing a good defense and they have not shown me that they can consistently beat teams that have a good defense. There are nine teams in the NFL that have given up less than 21 points per game this year. The Lions have faced three of those teams and they've gone 0-3 in those games. Let's take a look at what happened in those three games: \nWeek 1: Packers 27-13 over LionsWeek 6: Chiefs 30-17 over LionsWeek 11: Eagles 16-9 over Lions Not only are they 0-3, but they've been outscored 73-39 and they're averaging just 13 points per game. In all three of these games, the Lions were held under 100 yards rushing and when they can't run the ball, that puts all the pressure on Jared Goff. Goff is a good quarterback, but he seems to struggle at times when he's forced to carry the team. Goff got sacked a total of seven times in these three games, including four times in Detroit's season-opening loss to Green Bay. In that Week 1 game, Micah Parsons had practiced roughly three times and he didn't know the Packers' defense yet, but Green Bay still managed to shut down the Lions. The good news for the Lions is that even if they don't score a lot of points, they can still win because Green Bay's offense has forgotten how to move the ball through the air. The Packers' haven't looked the same since losing Tucker Kraft to a season-ending injury in Week 9. In three games without Kraft, Jordan Love is averaging just 163 passing yards per game. \nIf this turns into a defensive battle, I think the Packers win. If this turns into a shootout, I think the Lions win. In their past nine Thanksgiving games, the Lions haven't topped 25 points a single time, so I'm going to go ahead and say a shootout doesn't happen. Turkey won't be the only thing swallowed on Thursday, Goff is going to get swallowed up by the Packers defense. PICK: Packers 20-17 over Lions | Packers +2.5 |  Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKansas City (6-5) at Dallas (5-5-1)Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nLast year, we got Tommy DeVito vs. Cooper Rush in the Cowboys' game on Thanksgiving, and the NFL clearly felt bad about that, because this year, we're getting possibly the best Thanksgiving game of all-time with Dak Prescott and the Cowboys facing Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. I still have nightmares about the DeVito-Rush game, but I think this matchup will help me finally get over that. This game is giving us two teams that both saved their season on Sunday: The Chiefs came back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Colts in overtime and then Dallas one-upped them by pulling off an even wilder comeback. The Cowboys beat the Eagles 24-21 in a game where they were trailing 21-0 at one point. The Chiefs' win was the biggest fourth quarter comeback of Mahomes' career while the Cowboys' win was the largest comeback in any game in franchise history, and now, we're getting these two teams in a playoff game. OK, this isn't technically a playoff game, but it's going to feel like it, because neither team can afford to lose. Normally, if there's a team in a must-win situation and the Chiefs are involved, I'm automatically taking them, but I'm not sure if I can do that this week. For one, this game is in Dallas. The Chiefs have been horrible on the road this year, going 1-4 and their only win came against the Giants, so I'm not even sure it counts (Sorry, Giants fans. Didn't mean to drag you into this. Between this and the whole playoff elimination thing, you're just catching strays from me today). \nThe Chiefs are 0-2 on the road this year in the month of November and a big reason they haven't won away from Kansas City is because Patrick Mahomes hasn't looked like Patrick Mahomes. In the two losses, Mahomes has completed just 55.7% of his passes with two interceptions and just one TD pass. For a good chunk of the season, Mahomes has been playing like he doesn't fully trust his receivers or maybe he doesn't trust his offensive line or maybe it's both. I can't quite tell which one, but it's definitely having an impact on what the Chiefs are able to do on offense. To make matters worse, the Chiefs won't have Pro Bowl right guard Trey Smith and this is the worst time to be missing your Pro Bowl right guard because the Cowboys defensive line has been extra dominant since adding Quinnen Williams on Nov. 4. Williams is a human wrecking ball. \nWilliams is so dominant, he can get you 40% off of a Pro Football Focus subscription. \nGoing into the trade deadline, the Cowboys had given up the fourth-most rushing yards per game this year (142.7) and the second most points per game (30.7). In the two games since adding Williams, the Cowboys are 2-0 and they've give up just 45 rushing yards and 18.5 points per game. I don't want to call Jerry Jones a genius, but the man is clearly playing 4-D chess while the rest of us are eating at the kids' table on Thanksgiving. Actually, I take that back, Jones hurt the team by trading Micah Parsons, which led to the Cowboys having the worst defense in the NFL through the first eight weeks and then he tried to save face by adding Williams. This is one of the rare instances where the person trying to save face might have actually saved his face. This could end up being the most watched regular season game in NFL history so I can't possibly pick against America's Team when most of America is going to be watching. PICK: Cowboys 31-24 over Chiefs | Cowboys +3 | Odds via BetMGMCincinnati (3-8) at Baltimore (6-5)Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC)\nI'm not sure what you're thankful for this year, but I'm guessing everyone at NBC is thankful that Joe Burrow is returning for this game. On paper, there's almost no reason to watch a 3-8 team play a 6-5 team this late in the season, but with the return of Burrow, this automatically becomes must-see TV. And we know Burrow is playing because he announced it on Instagram by sharing a high school photo of himself in a LeBron James Cavaliers jersey. \nDoes it seem a little crazy for the Bengals to bring Burrow back during what appears to be lost season? Yes, but it's not completely crazy, because the Bengals play in the division that no one wants to win. Here's what the AFC North currently looks like along with each team's remaining schedule: 1. Ravens (6-5) -- Bengals, Steelers, at Bengals, Patriots, at Packers, at Steelers2. Steelers (6-5) -- Bills, at Ravens, Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, Ravens3. Bengals (3-8) -- at Ravens, at Bills, Ravens, Dolphins, Cardinals, Browns4. Browns (3-8) -- 49ers, Titans, at Bears, Bills, Steelers, at BengalsThe Bengals still have to play the Ravens twice and if they pull off a sweep against Baltimore, that essentially puts them right back in the division race. I'm not saying it's going to happen, I'm just saying that throwing Burrow out there this week is a Hail Mary play that could pay off. \nIn Burrow's first game back, he'll get to face a Ravens defense that's surrendering 230.1 passing yards per game this year, which ranks in the bottom 10 in the NFL. Baltimore's defense has certainly looked better over the past three weeks, but it's hard to say if that's actual improvement or if that's just happened because their last three games have come against Tyrod Taylor (Jets), Dillon Gabriel (Browns) and J.J. McCarthy (Vikings). I have no idea what Burrow is going to look like after two months away, but even a rusty Burrow is an upgrade over those three quarterbacks. And let's not forget, Burrow will have Ja'Marr Chase, who was suspended for Cincinnati's game against New England on Sunday. Even with Chase and Burrow, you can't fully trust the Bengals because of their defense. They haven't been able to stop anyone this year, but this week, they get to face a Ravens' offense that has gotten real good at stopping itself. Over the past three weeks, Lamar Jackson hasn't looked like Lamar Jackson. Since Week 10, he hasn't topped 200 passing yards a single time, he has more interceptions (2) than touchdown passes (1) and his completion percentage has been below 60% (57.1%). He also seems hesitant to run: Jackson has averaged just 14.8 rushing yards per game since returning from his hamstring injury in Week 9. The Bengals are going to be desperate and I think they're going to get a spark from Burrow's return, but I'm not sure that spark is going to be quite big enough to pull off the upset here. PICK: Ravens 27-24 over Bengals | Bengals +7 |Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20X:Chicago (8-3) at Philadelphia (8-3)Friday, 3 p.m. ET (Prime)\nThe Black Friday game is back! I have made it an annual tradition to watch this game on my phone from a mall parking lot so that I get the full Black Friday feel and I highly suggest that you guys all do the same. Anyway, we're headed into Week 13 and I still have no idea if the Bears are any good. Yes, they're 8-3, but only one of those eight wins has come against a team that's currently above .500 and that lone win came on Sunday against a Steelers team that didn't have Aaron Rodgers. Also, the Bears have been collectively outscored by their opponents this year, which makes them just the third team in NFL history to win eight of their first 11 games despite having a negative point differential. I'm not saying the Bears are frauds, but I'm not saying they're not. The Bears have played four games this year against teams that are over .500 and they've gone 1-3 in those games, which could pose a problem down the stretch, because five of their final six games are against teams who are all at least THREE games over .500. Oh, and if you make the playoffs, you'll probably be facing a team that's over .500. This game is going to tell us a lot about both teams. The Bears have been pretty good this year, but if there's one thing they've struggled with, it's stopping the run. They've given up an average of 138.1 rushing yards per game, which is the fifth-most in the NFL. The Eagles are 5-0 this season when they top 100 yards and this should be the perfect game for them to once again hit that number. If the Eagles can't get Saquon Barkley going against this defense, they might just want to give up on running the ball for the rest of the season.The Eagles actually looked like they gave up on running the ball (and passing the ball) against the Cowboys. Philly blew a 21-0 lead in Week 12 and that mostly happened because the offense didn't score a single point over the final 40 minutes of the game. They went seven straight possessions without scoring and if that Eagles team shows up, then the Bears are going to win, but I don't think that Eagles team is going to show up. PICK: Eagles 27-17 over Bears | Eagles -7 |  Odds via FanDuel SportsbookHouston (6-5) at Indianapolis (8-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nIf I've learned one thing this month, it's that the Colts' entire season is a house of cards and it could collapse at any time. When the month of November started, the Colts were 7-1 and they looked like a lock to win the AFC South, but over the past three weeks, Daniel Jones has turned into the Daniel Jones that most people thought he would be when he won the starting job. You know how the first three Indiana Jones movies are all good, but then the last two were just OK? That's Daniel Jones right now. He got off to a hot start, but now, he's just OK. He's thrown four interceptions over the past three weeks, and in a loss to the Chiefs, he threw for just 181 yards. With the game on the line in the fourth quarter against Kansas City, Jones went just 2 of 8 for 13 yards. That's not ideal. The Colts have lost two of their past three while the Texans have won three games in a row, which has put Houston right back in the race for the AFC South title. Let's take a look at the top three spots in the standings: 1. Colts (8-3)2. Jaguars (7-4)3. Texans (6-5)(The Titans also exist, but let's not worry about them). The Colts haven't imploded yet, but that will be dangerously close to happening if they lose this game. If the Colts want to win on Sunday, all they have to do is figure out how to move the ball against the best defense in NFL. The Texans have given up the fewest yards per game (264.3), the second-fewest points per game (16.5), the third-fewest passing yards per game (172.1) and the fifth-fewest rushing yards per game (92.2). They also have 33 sacks on the season and they were so good in Week 12 that they made Josh Allen look like a Division II college quarterback. This feels like a game where the Colts will try to get Jonathan Taylor going, but the Texans will be ready for that, which means if Indy is going to win, Daniel Jones is going to have to come up big. Three weeks ago, I trusted him. I was drinking the Daniel Jones Kool-Aid, but it tasted a little funny, so I spit it out, which is almost fitting, because I feel like the Texans are going to chew him up and spit him out on Sunday. PICK: Texans 19-16 over Colts | Texans +4.5 | Odds via BetMGMNFL Week 13 picks: All the rest49ers 20-16  over BrownsJaguars 24-17 over TitansDolphins 30-16 over SaintsFalcons 23-16 over JetsCardinals 20-17 over BuccaneersRams 30-20 over PanthersSeahawks 31-13 over VikingsBills 30-20 over SteelersChargers 27-20 over RaidersBroncos 23-16 over CommandersPatriots 26-23 over GiantsLast WeekBest pick: Last week, I predicted that Shedeur Sanders would lead the Browns to a win over the Raiders in his first career start and guess what happened? Shedeur Sanders led the Browns to a win over the Raiders in his first career starts. Now, did I know that Geno Smith was going to get sacked 10 times? Of course, I did. If you've watched the Raiders offense play at all this season, it was pretty clear that was going to happen. Every time the Raiders have run a play this season, something bad seems to happen. On every play, it looks like everyone is confused about what they're supposed to do, which might explain why Chip Kelly got fired. The good news for the Raiders is that by firing Kelly, they're now one step closer to a future Super Bowl appearance. \nThe bad news for the Raiders is that they're now 2-9, which means for the 21st time over the past 23 years, they won't be finishing above .500. Worst pick: If you need something to be thankful for this week, just be thankful that you're not a Cardinals fan. The Cards have lost five games this year by four points or less, and for some reason, I thought maybe they could win a close game, so I picked them to beat the Jaguars last week, and that blew up in my face. The Cardinals had a chance to win the game in regulation, but apparently, no one explained to the offense how a spike is supposed to work. After a big play got Arizona down to Jacksonville's 11-yard line, the Cards could have spiked the ball to stop the clock, but instead, they did the opposite of what every other team in the NFL would do in this situation: They let the clock run. \nTrevor Lawrence turned the ball over four times, but the Cardinals lost because they don't understand clock management. This is usually where I would say \"I'm never picking them to win another game,\" but I'm picking them again this week. I clearly hate myself. Finally, if you guys have ever wondered which teams I'm actually good at picking, I'm going to start sharing that information with you now that we've got 12 full weeks of information. Here's a quick look at my best teams when it comes to picks this year. Teams I'm 10-1 picking this year (Straight up): Titans, RaidersTeams I'm 9-2 picking this year (Straight up): Seahawks, Rams, Saints, Broncos, ColtsLongest winning streak: Raiders (10 straight games picked correctly)Teams I'm the worst at picking: Chiefs (4-7)Longest losing streak: Jaguars (Three straight games picked incorrectly)Picks RecordStraight up in Week 12: 10-4SU overall: 114-63-1Against the spread in Week 12: 12-2ATS overall: 87-91You can find John Breech on Facebook or Twitter, and if he's not doing one of those things, he's probably hiding an entire pumpkin pie in his fridge so he doesn't have to share it with his kids. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Thanksgiving NFL games are amongst the most watched on a yearly basis, and that should certainly be the case with the middle matchup of Thursday's slate. It has Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Kansas City (6-5) toppled Indianapolis, 23-20, in Week 12 and will be part of the NFL Thanksgiving tradition for the first time since 2006, going 5-5 all-time on Turkey Day. Offensive lineman Trey Smith (ankle) and tight end Noah Gray (concussion) have both been ruled out for Kansas City.Kickoff is from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Cowboys have won five straight home matchups against the Chiefs. Kansas City is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Chiefs vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points is 52.5.

Get 2 months at $2.99/monthWhy the Chiefs can coverThe Chiefs are coming off a win over the previously 8-2 Colts, despite Mahomes not throwing a touchdown, which shows that the team can win in multiple ways. Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone. As for Mahomes, the native Texan should relish his first pro game in Dallas as he gets to face the Cowboys' No. 30 pass defense as the Chiefs look to improve to 4-1 ATS versus NFC opponents this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Cowboys can coverIt's been over 50 years since the Chiefs won in Dallas, as the Cowboys have prevailed in their last five home games versus Kansas City. Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

Joe Burrow returns in the night game as the Bengals face the Ravens in an AFC North clash, looking to spark a late playoff run.For the cherry on top, we have another \"Black Friday\" game -- and it's a doozy with the Bears visiting the Eagles.

To whet our whistle in that department, the SportsLine Projection Model has cooked up a tasty parlay that pays +1129 for the Thanksgiving slate. One of the four legs includes taking the Lions on the moneyline. According to the projections, Detroit wins outright in 56% of simulations. To see the other three legs, head on over to SportsLine. Packers +2.5: \"The Lions are favored to win, but I think that's only because the oddsmakers were taking shots of potato vodka before setting the point spread. Potato vodka is the perfect Thanksgiving drink, but it's not good for setting point spreads. My problem with the Lions is that they are playing a good defense and they have not shown me that they can consistently beat teams that have a good defense. There are nine teams in the NFL that have given up less than 21 points per game this year. The Lions have faced three of those teams and they've gone 0-3 in those games.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer John Breech on why he has the Packers not only covering the 2.5-point spread in Detroit, but pulling off the outright upset.

The model simulates games over 10,000 times, and identifies top plays based on those scenarios. That has led the model to an impressive 49-33 record on top-rated picks since last season, and we're now putting this Thanksgiving matchup between the Chiefs and Cowboys in its crosshairs. We can tell you it has one side of the moneyline hitting in 62% of simulations. To see who that is, head on over to SportsLine.  Chiefs -3: \"This is essentially a playoff game. Neither team can afford a loss with where they are right now. Dallas upset the Eagles at home last week, while the Chiefs beat the Colts. Patrick Mahomes played well in that game and seemed to come alive in the fourth quarter. He will continue that here. Dak Prescott won't keep up. Chiefs take it.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he has Kansas City taking down the Cowboys, 30-24. To see the rest of his Week 13 picks, click here.Cowboys +3.5: \"This Cowboys defense is no longer one of the worst units in the NFL. Since they acquired Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson (and activated some other players from injured reserve), the Cowboys are 2-0 while allowing 18.5 points per game and 45 rushing yards per game. Previously ranked in the bottom five, the Cowboys run defense has been the best in the NFL over the last two weeks. Obviously the Chiefs aren't known for their incredible rushing attack, but I think the Cowboys offense can outscore Patrick Mahomes. Dallas has covered in back-to-back Thanksgiving games while the Chiefs have failed to cover in three straight contests. I say this Cowboys offense is too tough to contain.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Jordan Dajani on why he has the Cowboys covering the spread and beating the Chiefs outright on Thanksgiving.

Yes, they've won five straight after beginning the year 1-5 and are now atop the AFC North standings, but they seem a bit disjointed in recent weeks. Specifically, Lamar Jackson hasn't been as prolific as we've grown accustomed to, tallying zero touchdowns and two giveaways over the last two weeks. While Cincinnati's defense is one of the worst units in the NFL this season, they played the Patriots well last week, providing a glimmer of hope that they can be something close to serviceable down the stretch. If they provide some resistance, that'll help Joe Burrow immensely as he makes his return to action for the first time since suffering his turf toe injury. With Ja'Marr Chase back in the fold as well, the Bengals have an offense that can keep this divisional matchup close. In his career, Burrow is 17-3 ATS as an underdog of three or more points.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Tyler Sullivan on why he is taking the points with the Bengals in this final leg of Thursday's triple-header. To see the rest of his Week 13 picks, click here. Bengals +7: \"I'm assuming here that Joe Burrow plays, as is expected. The Ravens have looked ... okay since Lamar Jackson's return from injury. The defense has been better since it got healthier and, with Tee Higgins out, should be able to really focus in on Ja'Marr Chase. But the offense hasn't been explosive enough for me to think the Ravens are going to blow these guys out. Until we see Lamar Jackson look fully healthy, I continue to think they'll play close games.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer Jared Dubin on why he has Cincinnati covering over Baltimore.

In his last 67 picks involving Philadelphia, Silverstein is 40-25-1 (+1260), which makes him an ideal expert to lean on for this \"Black Friday\" contest from Lincoln Financial Field. We can tell you Silverstein is leaning Under the 44.5 point total, but to see his official play for this standalone matchup, you'll need to log on to SportsLine. \nEagles -7: \"This is a big prove-it game in front of the national audience for the Bears. For the Eagles, it's a chance to get back on track after losing to the Cowboys. I think they will. Their defense will force some Caleb Williams turnovers that lead to short fields. And Saquon Barkley will actually get the ball. Eagles win it.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he likes Philly to bounce back with a 30-21 win over the Bears at home.

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game.

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent right-hander Dylan Cease on a seven-year pact worth $210 million, according to the New York Post. The Blue Jays have not yet announced the signing, but when they do it will become the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the franchise, topping George Springer's six-year agreement worth $150 million. Cease, who turns 30 next month, is fresh off a disappointing season. He posted a 4.55 ERA (94 ERA+) and a 3.03 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 32 starts with the San Diego Padres. Cease's arsenal continued to grade favorably, however, leading CBS Sports to rank him as the 11th-best free agent available. Here's what we wrote:Here's one for the dip buyers. Cease notched his fifth campaign in a row with 32 or more starts but, despite underlying data that bore resemblance to his past efforts, posted the worst full-season ERA+ of his career. Teams may ask themselves: what was going on with his slider? Cease is a two-pitch pony (fastballs and sliders combined for a usage rate over 80%), yet he tinkered with his top breaker, throwing it harder with less depth and sweep. His results were worse, suggesting he should revert. True in one way, true in multiple ways.Cease's contract is tied for the seventh largest free-agent deal ever given to a starting pitcher. He will join a Blue Jays rotation that figures to also include Kevin Gausman, rookie sensation Trey Yesavage, José Berríos, and Shane Bieber, who opted in to his contract earlier this winter. \nToronto won the American League pennant and AL East in 2025, falling two outs short against the Dodgers of their first World Series title since 1993.Here are three other things to know about this deal.\n1. Fourth richest contract among active pitchersOnce pen is put to paper, Cease will become one of the highest paid pitchers in the sport, as judged by total value. Do not that the list below excludes Shohei Ohtani on the grounds that he's a two-way player.Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto: $325MYankees RHP Gerrit Cole:                     $324M Yankees LHP Max Fried:                       $218M Blue Jays RHP Dylan Cease: $210M Diamondbacks RHP Corbin Burnes:                 $210MIt's worth pointing out that Cease's contract doesn't rank as highly when judged by average annual value. Then he falls to sixth behind Zack Wheeler, Jacob deGrom, Blake Snell, Cole, and Burnes, so far a multi-year contracts go. (Seth Lugo also has him beat if one-year deals are taken into consideration.)2. Why the Blue Jays chose Cease over Valdez, othersA fair question to ask in the wake of this signing is, well, why Cease? If the Blue Jays were deadset on adding a free-agent starter, why didn't they opt instead for left-hander Framber Valdez, Ranger Suárez, or any of the other free-agent options available to them.The Blue Jays will probably never provide the actual answer, but it seems reasonable to guess that it's because Cease is the most dynamic pitcher of the bunch. Indeed, he's struck out nearly 11 batters per nine innings for his career, as compared to Valdez's 8.9 and Suárez's 8.3 figures.\nAs an added bonus, Cease will add variety to a Blue Jays rotation that ranked 14th in the majors in strikeout rate. Rest assured, that won't be the case with him in tow.3. Good sign for other startersEven with the above subheading taken into consideration, you can bet that Valdez and other starters are tickled to see Cease's contract come in high.That's because the free-agent market is largely based on precedent. The agents for those pitchers can now argue that if Cease received this much, their client ought to receive at least the same.\nObviously that argument isn't guaranteed to end in a similarly lucrative contract. But those players and their agents have a better leg to stand on when they're making them now than they did coming into the week.\n            ",

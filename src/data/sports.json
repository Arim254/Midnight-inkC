    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Not only did the Baltimore Ravens see their playoff hopes dwindle with their 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots last week, but they also suffered a major hit to their lineup when star quarterback Lamar Jackson left in the second quarter with what was later determined to be a back contusion. The going is unlikely to get much easier on Saturday, as Jackson is listed as doubtful to play against the Green Bay Packers in Week 17.Jackson was estimated as a non-participant in Tuesday's walkthrough and did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday. Now Jackson is considered a long shot to play Saturday in Green Bay with the Ravens (7-8) potentially facing elimination from playoff contention with a loss. If Jackson can't play, Tyler Huntley will get the start -- his second of the season. The Ravens have reached the postseason the last three seasons but haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know this year. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later. Previously, Jackson was 16-0.Jackson, the two-time MVP, was injured in the second quarter against the Patriots on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from safety Craig Woodson. \nJackson, who struggled to walk out of the locker room after the game, admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game. \"It's BS, bro,\" Jackson said. \"I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.\"\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 17 NFL picks: Bills beat Eagles in shootout, Packers eliminate Ravens, Raiders win and lose\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Huntley replaced Jackson under center and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.\n\"My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,\" Jackson said. \"Pain. It hurts. [It] hurts.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe NFL Christmas Day tradition is a relatively new one, but most fans won't complain about spending another holiday watching football. One could make a Christmas NFL parlay from the three games on this year's slate, featuring Cowboys vs. Commanders (+8.5 at DraftKings) at 1 p.m. ET, Lions vs. Vikings (+7.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET and Chiefs vs. Broncos (-13.5) at 8:15 p.m. ET. A football parlay could consist of NFL player props, spread picks, over/under bets, money line predictions, or some combination of those. Players one could target with anytime touchdown NFL props include CeeDee Lamb (+115), George Pickens (+125), Aaron Jones (+150), Courtland Sutton (+140) and Travis Kelce (+400).The Chiefs are used to being favored by double-digits rather than underdogs, but that's their reality with backup quarterback, Gardner Minshew, now out after injuring his knee a week after Patrick Mahomes did the same. Underdogs of 13-plus points are 1-10 straight up this season but are 7-4 against the spread. Thus, making NFL bets that back the Broncos to win but the Chiefs to cover could be two legs of your NFL Christmas Day parlay. Before locking in any Christmas NFL picks or NFL parlays, be sure to see the NFL predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven computer model.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Lamb as an anytime touchdown scorer. Bet it at DraftKings right here:\nThe model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, the model has scoured the Week 17 NFL odds and locked in four confident NFL best bets for Christmas Day. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a massive payout of well over 9-1. You can only see the model's Christmas NFL parlay picks at SportsLine.Top Christmas NFL parlay picksAfter simulating every game 10,000 times, the model is backing the Over (50.5) to hit in Cowboys vs. Commanders at 1 p.m. ET. No team has eclipsed the total quite like Dallas this season as the Over is 11-4 for the team, the best Over percentage in the league. The Cowboys have gone over in each of their last four games, while four of their last five matchups with Washington have also gone over. That includes their Week 7 contest, which was one of the highest-scoring games of the season with 66 total points.The Commanders have also leaned over this year, as it's gone 5-2 over their last seven games. The Over is also 4-0 when the Commanders are home underdogs in 2025. With both teams out of the playoff picture, there's no reason to play conservatively as the simulations forecast the teams combining for 56 points. Thus, the Over hits almost 60% of the time. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here, and bet the Over at to hit at DraftKings:How to make Christmas NFL parlaysThe model also jumped on three other NFL picks, including a player prop that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Christmas NFL best bets and NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NFL picks, and which Christmas Day NFL bets should you target for an epic 9-1 payout?

    "body": "\nMaking NFL picks always carries a bit more excitement when there's something on the line, and that's the case with the Week 17 NFL schedule. No less than half a dozen matchups carry postseason implications for both teams, making them ideal ones to target with Week 17 NFL bets. Among those are Texans vs. Chargers (-1.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) and Ravens vs. Packers (-3) on Saturday, then Jaguars vs. Colts (+6.5), Seahawks vs. Panthers (+7) and Eagles vs. Bills (-1) on Sunday afternoon.Then on Sunday night, the 49ers are 3-point home favorites over the Bears, per the Week 17 NFL odds. If a rest edge matters to you, then you may want to back the Bears with Week 17 NFL predictions as Chicago's coming off a Saturday game, while San Fran is coming off a Monday game. All of the updated Week 17 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 17 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 17 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 17 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 17 NFL picks is that the Steelers (-3, 33.5) cover versus Cleveland on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh has rolled off three straight wins -- and three straight covers -- to control its own destiny to claim the AFC North. Meanwhile, Cleveland fought valiantly in its loss to the Bills on Sunday, but the Browns are now 0-4 straight-up and 1-3 ATS over the last month. Shedeur Sanders has brought excitement to the Browns but not necessarily many winning plays as no player has more turnovers (seven) than Sanders since he became starter in Week 12. Pittsburgh capitalizes off taking the ball away as the Steelers have covered in six straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. The model has Pittsburgh prevailing versus the spread nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 17 NFL predictions: the Bengals (-7, 53.5) cover against the Cardinals in a 1 p.m. ET kick on Sunday. Both teams are out of the playoff picture, but Cincinnati is in much better form overall. The Bengals have won two of their past four and have covered in four of their past five. The Cardinals, meanwhile, have dropped seven straight and are just 1-6 against the spread during that span. In addition to backing the Broncos, the model also says the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Bengals to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 17 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 17 NFL schedule and just revealed seven teams that outright win nearly 70% of the time, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        The presents have been cleared out from under the tree, and now college football bowl season has some more gifts to deliver with a trio of college football bowl games on Friday, Dec. 26. Northwestern takes on Central Michigan at 1 p.m. ET in the GameAbove Sports Bowl to begin the Friday college football action. Then, Minnesota squares off with New Mexico at 4:30 p.m. ET in the Rate Bowl, followed by UTSA vs. Florida International in the First Responder Bowl at 8 p.m. ET.Northwestern, Minnesota and UTSA are all favored in the latest college football odds, and the SportsLine projection model is backing all three favorites in its Friday college football best bets.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Northwestern (-10.5) vs. Central Michigan Northwestern should have a significant talent advantage as a Big Ten school going up against a MAC program, despite a 6-6 record this season. Five of the Wildcats' six losses came in Big Ten play, though, and Central Michigan's one Big Ten matchup this season certainly didn't go well for the Chippewas. Central Michigan lost to Michigan, 63-3, in September. Northwestern was significantly more competitive in its matchup against the Wolverines this season, losing 24-22 in November. Central Michigan is coming off a 21-3 loss to Toledo in its final MAC game as well. The model projects Northwestern to win in 54% of simulations. Back Northwestern at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:Minnesota (-2.5) vs. New Mexico Minnesota closed its season with a 17-7 win over Wisconsin to finish 7-5, including 5-4 in the Big Ten. New Mexico went 9-3, but the competition in the Mountain West doesn't compare to the Big Ten as a whole. Even though New Mexico went 6-2 in the Mountain West, four of those six wins came in one-score games. The Gophers should have the talent advantage, and they've been unbeatable in bowl games under head coach P.J. Fleck. Literally unbeatable. Minnesota is 6-0 in bowl games over Fleck's first eight years as head coach, and that's a trend the model expects to continue on Friday. The model projects Minnesota to win in 63% of simulations. Back Minnesota at FanDuel, where new users get $250 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:UTSA (-5.5) vs. FIU UTSA has a top-20 offense in college football this season, ranking 19th at 32.5 points per game this season. The Roadrunners' offense is orchestrated by a familiar last name for football fans, with Owen McCown as the team's QB1. McCown is the son of Josh McCown, who had a 16-year NFL career at quarterback. Owen McCown threw for 2,700 yards, but he wasn't a one-man show. Running back Robert Henry Jr. rushed for 1,045 yards on 6.9 yards per rush, which ranked ninth in college football. Meanwhile, Florida International is allowing 29.5 ppg this season, which ranks 90th in the nation.

The Vikings had previously lost six out of seven to drop from 3-2 to 4-8, so it's been quite the turnaround. Those three games all came against the NFC East, though, and the competition will be tougher here.Detroit has lost two in a row and three of its last four as it has been trying to stay in the thick of the playoff race. The Lions are coming off a wild loss to the Steelers wherein they scored two potential game-winning touchdowns on their final drive, only to have both negated by penalty. They need to come away with a win here in order to keep their playoff hopes alive.Will the Lions keep their playoff hopes alive, or will the Vikings put a fork on their division rivals? We'll find out soon enough. But before we detail at some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Vikings vs. LionsDate: Thursday, Dec. 25 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: U.S. Bank Stadium (Minneapolis)Stream: NetflixFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -7.5, O/U 43.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesLions' playoff chances. Detroit's postseason hopes are on life support. Detroit is sitting in eighth place in the NFC, 1.5 games back of the seventh-place Packers. The Lions need to win both of their remaining games, and have the Packers lose both of their remaining games. The Vikings will play a big role in that effort, because they play the Lions and Packers in their last two games of the year. So, Detroit has to beat Minnesota and then root as hard as possible for Minnesota next week. Max Brosmer's second chance? In Brosmer's first start, he went 19 of 30 for 126 yards and four interceptions, one of which was a pick six. That game, though, was against the hellacious Seattle Seahawks defense. This Detroit defense is, to put it kindly, not that Seahawks defense. He should have a better chance to get going here. Maybe his 7 of 9 for 52 yards performance in relief of J.J. McCarthy last weekend will foreshadow a better effort in what could be his second career start.Injuries all over the place. The Lions have Sam LaPorta, Brian Branch, Kerby Joseph, Terrion Arnold, Levi Onwuzurike, Brock Wright and more on injured reserve. Basically their entire offensive line is banged up and they have been playing a M.A.S.H. unit up front. The Vikings have Jonathan Greenard, Josh Metellus and Christian Darrisaw on IR, while players like McCarthy, T.J. Hockenson, Ryan Kelly, Jordan Mason and more are likely out for this game after they didn't practice on either Monday or Tuesday. That's a lot of important players on both sides of the ball who are unlikely to play.Lions vs. Vikings prediction, pickBrosmer is going to start this game for Minnesota. Given what we've seen from him in his short time in the league, that is not at all encouraging for Minnesota's chances. Even against a depleted Lions defense, I don't expect him to have much success. The Lions, meanwhile, absolutely need to put together their best performance of the season here in order to keep their playoff hopes alive. After the way the first game between these two teams went, I expect them to bounce back and put up some points, with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs and Jameson Williams putting on a show.\nPick: Lions 27, Vikings 10 | (Detroit -7.5, Under 43.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is going to have a massive impact on the playoff picture in both the AFC and the NFC.Entering the Christmas Day tripleheader, there were already five teams that have clinched playoff berths in each conference, with still four total spots in the playoffs up for grabs. That number changed to three when the Green Bay Packers earned a berth thanks to the Minnesota Vikings' win over the Detroit Lions. Additionally, we still have plenty to go when it comes to the seeding in each conference, including who will be the No. 1 seeds.The nightcap of the Christmas tripleheader had playoff implications as well as the Denver Broncos strengthened their hold on the top seed in the AFC by defeating the Kansas City Chiefs.On Saturday, the Baltimore Ravens are trying to keep their hopes alive by beating the Green Bay Packers, who themselves still have an outside shot of winning the NFC North if they can beat Baltimore. Additionally, the Houston Texans are trying to wrap up their playoff trip while the Los Angeles Chargers are attempting to keep pace in both the wild card race and the AFC West. \nOn Sunday, the Steelers can wrap up the AFC North with a win or can have the division locked up before they take the field if the Ravens lose to the Packers. The Jaguars can knock the Colts out of the playoffs. The Buccaneers can put some pressure on the Panthers, who themselves can throw a wrench into the Seahawks' plans for the top seed in the NFC. Both the Eagles and Bills are already in the playoffs but can still move up in the seedings. And the Bears and 49ers are trying to jockey for positioning in the NFC and keep their No. 1 seed hopes alive. Then we get to the Rams on Monday night, who have a lot to play for when it comes to both the NFC West and the wild card race.As we continue to monitor the latest movements in the playoff standings, here is an up-to-date look at where things stand.AFC standingsx-Denver Broncos (13-3)x-New England Patriots (12-3)x-Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)x-Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)x-Buffalo Bills (11-4)Houston Texans (10-5)x-clinched playoff berth\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. ChargersDenver got back to its winning ways with a key victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. With the win, the Broncos remain the No. 1 seed in the conference and close in on the AFC West crown. A loss by the Chargers against the Texans on Saturday clinches the division for the Broncos.\n2. New England Patriots (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots secured their spot in the playoffs after rallying for an 11-point deficit against the Ravens to move to 12-3 on the season. The victory not only clinched their spot in the postseason, but it continued to keep the Bills at arms length for first place in the AFC East.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars made a statement in Week 16 that they are a serious player in the AFC playoff race after beating the Broncos on the road. That extends Jacksonville's winning streak to six games, as the Jaguars seem to be peaking at the right time. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)Remaining schedule: at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers have won three straight and continue to give themselves breathing room in the AFC North playoff race, especially after taking down the Lions. On top of that, the Ravens fell to the Patriots, which means the only way Baltimore can leapfrog them is if they win out and Pittsburgh loses out. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers have now won four straight games after taking down the Cowboys in Dallas on Sunday. Currently, they are the top wild card in the AFC, but have some stiff competition behind them. That includes the Houston Texans, who they'll see in Week 17 at SoFi Stadium.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Buffalo Bills (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt was a bit closer than they may have liked, but the Bills came away with a win in Cleveland to push them to 11-4 on the season. That keeps them on the heels of the Patriots in the AFC East race and firmly in wild card position. Week 16 was the final time Buffalo will be on the road during the 2025 regular season, as they'll wrap up the year at Highmark Stadium.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (10-5)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have won seven straight games to put themselves in a comfortable position inside the playoff picture. Houston extended that winning streak with a victory over the Raiders at home that was much closer than anticipated, but they are knocking on the door of clinching. \nIn the huntThe Ravens (7-8) saw a massive dent get put into their playoff hopes with their loss to the Patriots in Week 16. Baltimore's only path to the playoffs is via the AFC North, which it can win if Pittsburgh loses out and it wins out. NFC standingsx-Seattle Seahawks (12-3)x-Chicago Bears (11-4)z-Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)Carolina Panthers (8-7)x-San Francisco 49ers (11-4)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-4)x-Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle pulled off an incredible, come-from-behind win over the Rams on \"Thursday Night Football,\" elevating itself to the No. 1 seed in the conference in the process. If the Seahawks win out against the Panthers and Niners, they will clinch the top spot in the NFC and a bye in the first round of the playoffs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-4)Remaining schedule: at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears are coming off a stunning comeback win over the Packers in Week 16, and they remain in the hunt for the NFC's No. 1 seed. Thanks to the Pittsburgh Steelers taking down the Detroit Lions on Sunday, Chicago has officially clinched a playoff berth, but the division is still yet to be clinched.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)Remaining schedule: at Bills, vs. CommandersPhiladelphia punched its playoff ticket on Saturday night with a commanding victory over the Washington Commanders. The defending Super Bowl champions become the first team to win back-to-back NFC East crowns since 2004.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Carolina Panthers (8-7)Remaining schedule: vs. Seahawks, at BuccaneersCarolina has jumped up to the No. 4 seed after leaping over the Buccaneers for the NFC South lead thanks to a head-to-head victory in Week 16. While this does vault the Panthers atop the division for the moment, there's still plenty that can happen between now and the end of the regular season, especially with another matchup on deck for Week 18 in Tampa. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. San Francisco 49ers (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe 49ers are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race and clinched a postseason berth after the Lions fell to the Steelers. San Francisco jumped the Rams into the No. 5 spot after walloping the Colts on \"Monday Night Football,\" and it's positioned to climb even higher over the final two weeks.\nIf the 49ers beat the Bears and Seahawks to close out the season, they'll secure the No. 1 seed and the conference's lone first-round bye.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are still a playoff lock thanks to their win in Week 15, but their chances of winning the NFC West and claiming the No. 1 seed in the conference were dramatically reduced by their loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night. They need Seattle to lose at least one more game, but also can't have the 49ers win out. Otherwise, San Francisco would be the top seed in the conference by virtue of having the best division record among the three teams. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay saw a considerable fall from grace entering Week 16. After coming into Week 15 as the No. 2 seed and leading the NFC North, the Packers dropped all the way to the No. 7 seed following a loss to the Denver Broncos. That defeat allowed Chicago to jump ahead of Green Bay for first place in the division.\nThings got even worse in Week 16. Not only did Green Bay give up a double-digit lead in the final two minutes -- eventually falling in overtime to the Bears -- but it also lost Jordan Love to a concussion. But with a playoff spot now secure, the Packers can focus on trying to win the NFC North.In the huntThe Buccaneers (7-8) have fallen out of first place in the NFC South after falling to the Panthers on Sunday. The only path for Baker Mayfield and Co. to make the playoffs at this point is to win the division, so there is zero margin for error over these final two weeks. They'll need to take care of business next week in Miami against the Dolphins before hosting the Panthers in what could be a win-and-in scenario in Week 18. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.                     We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.                      We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Javonte Williams at this point). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

That same opportunity is available for this game against a Dallas run defense that's allowed plenty of numbers to running back units, but only 15-plus PPR points to Jahmyr Gibbs in a three-score effort in Week 14. The Vikings running backs combined for 18.5 PPR points in Williams' last game, the Chiefs running backs stunk on Thanksgiving, and Saquon Barkley and Ashton Jeanty were held in check in Williams' first two games in Dallas. The Commanders have been pretty committed to the run all year and have dialed up at least 17 running back rushes in seven straight including many blowouts. You have to assume Croskey-Merritt will get the majority of those. Play it safe and call him a flex with some upside. MUST-STARTS: Dak Prescott, George Pickens, CeeDee Lamb  STARTS: Javonte Williams, Terry McLaurin, Jake Ferguson (low-end No. 1 TE)  FLEX: Jacory Croskey-Merritt (non-PPR)  SITS: Josh Johnson, Deebo Samuel, Jeremy McNichols, Cowboys DST, Commanders DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nThe Minnesota defense has been on an unbelievable run (ZERO passing touchdowns allowed in its past six games/155 pass attempts) and happens to have a rich recent history of blitzing Goff. However, Goff overcame heavy pass rush pressure in each of his past two games against good defenses and spiked each for 31-plus Fantasy points. He also has three instances in his five meetings against Brian Flores' Vikings defense where he's posted at least 22 Fantasy points in spite of his constant blitzing, including Week 9 this season (23.4). Goff's worst games against the Vikings have come in run-rampant efforts from the Lions, a definite possibility given Jahmyr Gibbs' potential and the Minnesota run defense (4.5 yards per rush allowed over its past four games, excluding garbage time). The worry I have is that the Vikings offense will sputter with undrafted rookie Max Brosmer at quarterback and two first-string offensive linemen out for this game. Their implied team total is 18 points. In four games when the Lions held opponents to 21 or fewer points this year, Goff has averaged 30.3 attempts with only one game over 16.7 Fantasy points. At minimum, I wouldn't expect a big game from Goff, and that means lowering expectations for his receivers a little bit, too.   \nMUST-STARTS: Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown  STARTS: Jared Goff (low-end No. 1 QB), Jameson Williams, Aaron Jones   FLEX: Justin Jefferson, David Montgomery (non-PPR)  SITS: Max Brosmer, Jordan Addison, Josh Oliver, Isaac TeSlaa, Ross Dwelley, Vikings DST, Lions DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nIn their first game with nothing to play for, the Chiefs pass rush blitzed on 48.4% of Cam Ward's dropbacks, but got pressure just 22.6% of the time and sacked him twice versus what's been a mostly bad Titans O-line. That's not good, and it's not a new problem for Kansas City's defense since they've underwhelmed most weeks, save for matchups against bad offensive lines. Denver is fourth-best in pass rush pressure allowed and first in sack rate allowed. That's a good omen for Bo Nix, who began last week throwing really well but toward halftime threw erratically, then pressed when down two scores and ultimately fell into a disappointing stat line despite 47 pass attempts. Nix has never been good when under pressure, but this shouldn't be one of those games. In fact, there's potential the Broncos regroup and aim to build some confidence through the air, especially since the scoreboard should be in their favor given the absences in Kansas City's offense. I doubt it'll be like Week 18 last year when the Chiefs rested a bunch of their starters, and Nix threw four touchdowns, but I wouldn't rule out a 250-2-0 stat line from Nix either.    STARTS: Bo Nix, R.J. Harvey (No. 1 RB), Courtland Sutton, Travis Kelce (low-end No. 1 TE), Broncos DST   \nFLEX: Troy Franklin  SITS: All Chiefs other than Kelce, Marvin Mims, Evan Engram, Jaleel McLaughlin, Tyler Badie  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nJustin Herbert was blitzed on 54.5% of his dropbacks at Dallas last week and wasn't sacked once. Some of that is on the Cowboys pass rush just not playing well, but most of it is on Herbert evading defenders, keeping his eyes downfield, and making some awesome throws. He's capable of it in any matchup, but the step-up in competition from Dallas to Houston is large -- especially since Houston's cornerbacks have played really well all year and will cover better than how Dallas did last week. It makes Herbert a very risky Fantasy consideration given how he's fared behind his depleted O-line in five of his past six (16.8 or fewer Fantasy points in every matchup except Dallas). Also, 11 of 15 quarterbacks against the Texans all season have posted 20.1 or fewer Fantasy points, including single-digits for Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, under 12 points to Trevor Lawrence twice, and under 16 points to Matthew Stafford.   There's one other factor that could impact Herbert: his own run game. Omarion Hampton pulled even with Kimani Vidal in snap rate last week before Vidal got hurt, then Hampton essentially became a workhorse and did very well. The Texans run defense is very good statistically on the ground, but they have some liabilities at linebacker, at D-tackle, and at strong safety that could extend gains for Hampton much like Ashton Jeanty had last week. Hampton has also seen a target on three of 11 routes he's run in his past three games when Herbert's been pressured, which is a really high concentration of targets and a sign that Herbert looks to him to bail him out of pressure. As long as Vidal is out, Hampton qualifies as a very good starting option based on volume.   \nChargers linebacker Denzel Perryman is suspended this week and next week. When he was out for the Bolts in Weeks 2 through 6, they gave up an average of 5.1 yards per carry, an explosive run rate of 11.5%, and five RB rushing touchdowns. When Perryman came back in Week 7 and through Week 16, the Chargers tightened up to 3.5 yards per carry, a 5.4% explosive run rate, and just two rushing touchdowns to RBs. Backup linebacker Troy Dye has been a liability for almost every game during the stretch Perryman missed, and he figures to be the replacement this week against the Texans. You could almost envision one of Woody Marks or Jawhar Jordan breaking a long run because of a missed tackle. But which one? And will Houston's O-line down starting tackles Aireontae Ersery and Trent Brown make things much tougher on both of them? These questions keep both backs in the low-end flex range, especially since it's been clear that Houston doesn't mind using as many as four running backs from game to game.   MUST STARTS: Nico Collins  STARTS: Omarion Hampton (especially if Vidal is out), Ladd McConkey, Dalton Schultz, Texans DST, Chargers DST  FLEX: Quentin Johnston  SITS: Justin Herbert (high-end No. 2 QB), C.J. Stroud, Woody Marks (desperation RB), Jayden Higgins, Christian Kirk, Jawhar Jordan, Oronde Gadsden II, Keenan Allen  \n\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nTyler Huntley has been on and off the field a bunch since 2020, mostly for the Ravens but for the Dolphins in 2024, too. In his career, Huntley has helped two wide receivers get over 15 PPR points (Tyreek Hill in 2024, Rashod Bateman in 2021). Zay Flowers' career-best game with Huntley is 14.1 in Week 8 this year, followed by 11.5 in a half last week against the Pats. However, there have been 13 instances of a tight end getting at least 10.2 PPR points from Huntley, but none in 2025. Not that we're trusting a Ravens tight end anyway, especially since Green Bay's only allowed six tight ends to notch 10 PPR points this season. Their heavy zone coverages have done a good job of limiting big plays from not just tight ends, but everybody. Caleb Williams was locked down for the first 58 minutes of the game before coming unglued last week -- not something we should expect from Huntley. All of this is to say that Flowers is only startable because of the usage he's earned over the past few weeks, not because of some kind of exceptional matchup and certainly not because of the quarterback. He feels more like a high-end flex than a stud No. 2 receiver.   MUST STARTS: Derrick Henry  STARTS: Josh Jacobs (No. 2 RB), Packers DST  FLEX: Zay Flowers, Christian Watson (low-end flex)  SITS: Malik Willis, Tyler Huntley, Emanuel Wilson, Mark Andrews (desperation TE), Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, DeAndre Hopkins, Rashod Bateman, Keaton Mitchell, Isaiah Likely, Luke Musgrave, Ravens DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nNothing really changed with Kenneth Walker's role last week -- he still took a backseat to Zach Charbonnet in snap share and only had two more carries (and one more touch) than Charbonnet in the game. He just did a lot more with the work he got. Walker deserves credit for displaying quicker feet and decisiveness, but I don't think it means he's suddenly going to go back to being Seattle's feature RB and displace Charbonnet. No one's complaining about the matchup this week as the Panthers have let up 4.9 yards per rush to running backs in their past four, complete with a 10.8% explosive rush rate allowed and a whopping five rushing scores. There's room here for both backs to be good, albeit on limited volume, because they'll share so much. Charbonnet has the edge on scoring because of his consistent opportunities near the goal line.   \nOn the season, Tetairoa McMillan's highest target per route run rates have come when Bryce Young isn't pressured (27.6%) and when McMillan's gone up against man-to-man coverage (29%). The one-on-one coverage isn't likely -- Seattle plays a lot of zone coverage -- but time in the pocket is possible. Seattle's pass rush has sort of waned over the last month, only delivering a good dose of pressure last week against the Rams, but failing to sack or create turnovers of Matthew Stafford. The Panthers offensive line hasn't been pretty, but a return of Ickey Ekwonu at left tackle would be huge. That would give Young a little more time to fire downfield to McMillan, who may see some inferior coverage given some injuries in Seattle's secondary. Tack on the likely game script of the Panthers either chasing points or playing in a competitive game, and McMillan can be started as a decent No. 2 receiver.   And a quick fact: Excluding garbage time, Seattle has not allowed a running back rush of 12-plus yards in five straight games, and in that span, just three runs went even 10 yards, and only Blake Corum scored on them. This defense travels and will cause all sorts of problems for the Panthers running backs on the ground. It's going to be really hard to start Rico Dowdle or Chuba Hubbard with any confidence, especially since they split the carries 60-40 last week in favor of Dowdle; Hubbard played more on third downs, along with both snaps inside the 10. Dowdle has 12.4 or fewer PPR points in four straight games, Hubbard has 8.3 or fewer in six of his past seven.

It would mean the result of their game in Cleveland is meaningless. Mike Tomlin said he \"may\" consider resting starters if the Ravens lose, but his history suggests the Steelers will play healthy younger starters even if they can't improve their playoff seeding. You can be sure that the Steelers won't put many offensive wrinkles out there for potential playoff opponents to see, which could stunt any numbers that come from specific gameplans.   \nAgainst maybe any other opponent, I'd caution against the Steelers running backs, who truly benefited from a terrible Lions run defense last week. But the Browns run defense has been trounced to the tune of 5.5 yards per rush and seven total touchdowns in their past three, and the Steelers have no reason to get away from their newfound dual backfield. It keeps both Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell as starting options -- assuming the Steelers have something to play for.

The simple short throws he made with ease, and he deserves credit for averaging 8.4 yards per attempt on his 12 throws of 10-plus air yards, but he completed just half of them. With another week's worth of practice we might expect better synergy with Waddle (he seems already there with Darren Waller). Tampa Bay's pass defense has been beaten up by the Panthers and Falcons in consecutive weeks, so it's not like they're a real tough matchup. I started the week nervous about Waddle but Ewers was good enough to get him the ball on the first two levels of the defense, making him worth trusting as a No. 2 receiver (if only because so many other receivers carry way too many questions). Waller is a borderline starter. MUST-STARTS: De'Von AchaneSTARTS: Mike Evans, Bucky Irving, Jaylen Waddle, Darren Waller (borderline starter)FLEX: Emeka Egbuka, Chris Godwin  SITS: Baker Mayfield, Quinn Ewers, Sean Tucker, Rachaad White, Malik Washington, Jaylen Wright, Cade Otton, Buccaneers DST, Dolphins DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nSTARTS: Drake Maye, Rhamondre Stevenson (as long as TreVeyon Henderson is out), Stefon Diggs, Hunter Henry, Patriots DST  FLEX: Breece Hall, Adonai Mitchell, Mack Hollins (low-end flex)  SITS: Brady Cook, John Metchie III, Isaiah Williams, Jets DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nLast week Taysom Hill set season-highs in snap share (43.6%, only his second game this year over 40%), targets (six, previous high was two) and carries (12, previous high was 10 but had four or fewer in 7 of 11 games). It's possible his opportunities rose because the Saints simply weren't comfortable with Audric Estime and Evan Hull handling all of the backfield work, but it seems more likely that Hill was afforded one last chance to shine in the Superdome, his home for nine seasons, and etch an NFL record along the way for being the league's first 1,000/1,000/1,000 yard player in passing, rushing and receiving in the Super Bowl era. After the game, Hill spoke of how much it meant to him to have family present, and that he knew that coach Kellen Moore was calling plays to help him go out with a bang. If you haven't learned anything from the failed Isaiah Likely/Colby Parkinson tight end wishcasting from the last two weeks then you'll probably start Hill expecting the same thing. There's been no indication that Hill's role will stay at the level we saw in Week 16, meaning that he could go right back to seeing 10 or fewer touches including two or fewer receptions. It also doesn't help that the Titans run defense has become the No. 1 unit in yards per rush allowed, 10-yard rush rate allowed and defensive total rush EPA over the past four weeks (they're sixth-best in success rate). Unless we find out that he'll definitely stay in a voluminous role, I think Fantasy managers are taking a big chance by starting Hill, particularly over any tight end who could get five catches.   STARTS: Chris Olave, Juwan Johnson, Tony Pollard (low-end No. 2 RB), Saints DST  FLEX: Tyjae Spears  SITS: Tyler Shough (desperation QB), Cam Ward,  Taysom Hill (desperation TE),  Chimere Dike, Elic Ayomanor, Chig Okonkwo, Audric Estime, Evan Hull, Titans DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nSTARTS: Ashton Jeanty  FLEX: Tyrone Tracy Jr., Wan'Dale Robinson  SITS: Jaxson Dart, Geno Smith, Tre Tucker, Darius Slayton, Theo Johnson, Devin Singletary, Jack Bech, Michael Mayer, Raiders DST, Giants DST  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nBuffalo's pass defense has started experimenting and (mostly) succeeding with man-to-man coverage, playing it mostly on third downs. Only Joe Burrow has truly taken advantage in the Bills' past four games; Drake Maye would have done better if his defense could have gotten off the field more often in Week 15. The real factor is Buffalo's pass rush -- it hasn't shined outside of last week's game against the Browns' bad offensive line. It's always a long day for defenses if they can't pressure Jalen Hurts because he'll either take extra time to scan for an open target or he'll take off running if there's open space in front of him. His last two games against weak defenses in Las Vegas and Washington are examples of how he can still get the job done through the air. Buffalo's not nearly as weak of a unit, which keeps Hurts' upside a little limited, but if they can't crush the Eagles offensive line and try playing more man-to-man coverage (Hurts has been mega-efficient against it this season), then Hurts will have a better game than we anticipate. As it stands, Hurts should find at least 20 Fantasy points, which he's done in 10 of his past 13 games.   Something was way off with Josh Allen in the second half of last week's game. Maybe it had to do with a foot injury he suffered while taking a sack late in the first half, but he completed just half of 12 passes for 44 yards, and he didn't rush much either. He practiced all week and is expected to play, but a sub-100 percent Allen against a strong Eagles pass defense could create some problems. Philadelphia will get Jalen Carter back on its D-line to increase the pressure they can put on Allen, plus they've been playing more man-to-man coverage on third down. Allen doesn't quite have the wide receivers to win against man coverage, plus he's been less efficient and has thrown more interceptions against man coverage this year than zone. Allen's a starter, no doubt, but this feels like a tough spot. That's why he's not a top-3 quarterback like he usually is, and it's why none of his receivers are ranked particularly high either.   MUST-STARTS: Josh Allen, James Cook, Saquon Barkley, A.J.

It's especially noteworthy because Sean McVay has had no qualms about resting starters in the past, but that was just for the final week of the regular season. I imagine even in this scenario, the Rams would play their starters for a good portion of the game since they have game preparations in place, but they might not reveal any new quirks or designs that potential playoff opponents could plan for. This wouldn't be enough to bench any Rams players before Monday, but I might want to think through some options just in case. Example: If I had Stafford, I'd want Kirk Cousins on my bench, or if I had the Rams DST, I might either pass on them or have the Falcons DST in case all the starters were ruled inactive before the game.

That may not be the case this year as the Sabres work their way onto the nice list with a seven-game winning streak.Earlier this season, I buried the Sabres in these very power rankings, and I underestimated how long the Eastern Conference standings would be a compressed mess. The difference between last place and second place is a mere 10 points.That has opened the door for any team lucky enough to get hot at the right time, and the Sabres have seized upon that opening with a nice run just in time for Christmas. Buffalo is now just three points out of a playoff spot with a game in hand, and it feels like belief is starting to build.Over this stretch, Alex Lyon has stepped up as the No. 1 option in net with 3.94 goals saved above average, and Tage Thompson has tallied four goals and four assists. Rasmus Dahlin has also caught fire from the blue line with two goals and six assists while playing lights out defense.\nIn a wide open Eastern Conference, why can't the Sabres get hot and end their 14-season playoff drought? That's what fans are asking themselves as they get a little hope in their stockings this Christmas.With that in mind, here are the updated NHL Power Rankings with one Christmas wish for each team.\nAll expected goals and goals saved above average data courtesy of Natural Stat Trick.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                9\n            \n                Sabres\n            \n                7\n            \n                Maple Leafs\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Avalanche\n                                \n                            Power play prowess | The only thing this Avalanche team doesn't do well is score on the power play, which boggles the mind.

White said. \"Getting to the Over will depend on how well Minnesota moves the ball, and the Detroit defense, with its secondary injuries, has been awful of late, with seven of eight games since the bye getting to 50 points and four up to 60-plus. Max Brosmer didn't look as lost in relief duty last week and even had some rapport with Justin Jefferson, so this is a game where I see both teams getting into the 20s.\"  Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Lakers vs. Rockets: Over 229.5 total points (-110)Each of the Lakers and Rockets games on Tuesday went Over this total, with both teams displaying awful defense in lopsided losses. The Lakers allowed 132 points to the Suns, while the Rockets allowed 128 points to the Clippers. The Rockets have allowed at least 125 points in four of their last five games, while the Lakers have allowed at least 132 points in three of their last five games. Both teams feature elite offensive playmakers, such as Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Kevin Durant, leading the model to project the Over to hit in 65.1% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Chiefs (+13.5) vs. Broncos (-112)Yes, the Chiefs are down to their third-string quarterback, but they still have Andy Reid as the playcaller and offensive guru to get the most out of Chris Oladokun. The seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft didn't look completely lost in his relief of Gardner Minshew, who left with a knee injury, last week. Oladokun completed 11 of 16 passes for 111 yards. The Chiefs won't want to be embarrassed against a rival in front of a huge audience, and although the Broncos are 12-3 on the season, they haven't dominated teams they were expected to. Denver has one-score wins against the Titans, Jets, Giants, Commanders and Raiders this season, and only two of their wins all season have come by more than one score.

    "body": "\n        Eleven 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are around 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 15.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31 as Kyle Whittingham will coach his final game for the Utes. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5).

USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are several teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as plenty of underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

The pact includes a club option for an eighth year and escalators that can push the total value to $131 million.Soderstrom, 24, is coming off a breakout season. He hit .276/.346/.474 with 25 home runs and 93 runs batted in. His contributions were worth an estimated 4.3 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations.Soderstrom's 126 OPS+ ranked third among A's regulars, behind first baseman and American League Rookie of the Year Award winner Nick Kurtz and catcher Shea Langeliers. The A's ranked sixth in the AL in runs scored, trailing five playoff teams: the New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, and Detroit Tigers.Soderstrom, who was already under team control through the 2029 season, is now in possession of the largest contract in Athletics franchise history. That distinction previously belonged to right-hander Luis Severino, a free-agent signing from last winter who inked a three-year pact worth $67 million.\nThe A's are slated to enter their second season since departing Oakland as part of a multi-city relocation route. They spent last year and will spend the next few years in Sacramento until a ballpark is constructed in Las Vegas.\n            \n    ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                 What do the numbers mean?              \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                            To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                            If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                        Ready to get off on the right foot? Here's how to approach every play for this week in PPR leagues.

    "body": "\n        Happy Holidays to you and yours, and welcome to Week 17 of the NFL season. It's one of the weirdest weeks of the year, as we get three games on Christmas, including the Denver Broncos at the Kansas City Chiefs, and two on Saturday, including the Baltimore Ravens at the Green Bay Packers. This could end up being the most consequential week of the entire year. Division rivals Seattle Seahawks, Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers are all battling for the No. 1 seed in the NFC, the Broncos and New England Patriots are fighting for the top spot in the AFC, while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need a win to stay alive in the NFC South. Get ready for an insane weekend.Which teams should you pick in Week 17, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Christmas Eve over at DraftKings Sportsbook. Dallas Cowboys (-7.5) at Washington Commanders (Thursday)\nDajani (Cowboys -7.5): The Cowboys have been eliminated from playoff contention, but I expect Dak Prescott to still come out firing. He ranks second in the NFL with 4,175 passing yards, and is two passing touchdowns away from reaching 30 passing touchdowns for the fourth time in his career. As for the Commanders, 39-year-old Josh Johnson is starting at quarterback. I'm not sure he will be able to take advantage of this horrific Cowboys pass defense. Dallas defeated Washington earlier this year by 22 points, and the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Commanders by 11 points last week. Give me Dallas  …  Prediction: Cowboys 30, Commanders 20\nDubin (Cowboys -7.5): Washington is likely to be starting its third-string quarterback here, which is a massive problem even against the decrepit Cowboys defense. If Quinnen Williams comes back from his concussion to help the run defense, it may be difficult for Washington to move the ball. I expect no such thing to be true on the opposite side, where Dan Quinn's defense has totally fallen apart this year. Even while being eliminated from the playoffs, the Cowboys should put up some fireworks against this Washington defense.  … Prediction: Cowboys 28, Commanders 16Detroit Lions (-7.5) at Minnesota Vikings (Thursday)\nDajani (Lions -7.5): Max Brosmer is getting the start for the Vikings. The last time that happened, Minnesota was blanked by the Seahawks, 26-0. I'm not saying that's going to be the final score this Christmas, but can you imagine how upset Dan Campbell and his offense are after going 1-4 in the red zone last week in that loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers? I'm not even a Lions fan and I was feeling for them. Detroit has a +78 point differential this season, which is better than five double-digit win teams this year and five current NFC playoff teams. I have a feeling the Lions are going to unleash the fury of a thousand suns on the short-handed Vikings …  Prediction: Lions 31, Vikings 14Dubin (Lions -7.5): As Dajani mentioned, Max Brosmer is going to start this game for Minnesota. Given what we've seen from him in his short time in the league, that is not at all encouraging for Minnesota's chances. Even against a depleted Lions defense, I don't expect him to have much success. The Lions, meanwhile, absolutely need to put together their best performance of the season here in order to keep their playoff hopes alive. After the way the first game between these two teams went, I expect them to bounce back and put up some points.  … Prediction: Lions 27, Vikings 10\nDenver Broncos (-13.5) at Kansas City Chiefs (Thursday)\nDajani (Broncos -13.5): I feel gross taking all favorites on Christmas, but I'm not sure what else to do. I'm fading three third-string quarterbacks. The Chiefs just lost by 17 points to the previously 2-12 Tennessee Titans, so why should I expect them to cover 14 points against a loaded Broncos team that is out to avenge the upset loss they just suffered at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Chiefs looked legitimately lifeless in Tennessee. I don't think Chris Oladokun is the worst third-string quarterback in the world and offers something in terms of mobility, but this Broncos defense is an elite unit …  Prediction: Broncos 28, Chiefs 10Dubin (Broncos -13.5): If you saw what the Kansas City offense looked like last week against Tennessee with Chris Oladokun at the helm, you'll understand this pick. The Chiefs couldn't move the ball with any degree of success against the Titans defense. How are they going to come close to doing it against a Broncos defense that is among the best in the NFL? Especially when they're dealing with a ton of injuries. On the other side of the ball, I like the Broncos to be able to move it with relative ease against a Kansas City unit that allowed the Titans to do the same.  … Prediction: Broncos 27, Chiefs 7Houston Texans at Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5) (Saturday)\nDajani (Chargers -1.5): Poor Netflix wishes they had this game on Christmas instead of the \"third-string showcase,\" but don't expect many points in L.A. this Saturday. We all know the Texans rank No. 1 in both total defense and scoring defense, but Jesse Minter's unit has allowed fewer than 20 points in four straight home games. This unit held Prescott and Co. to 17 total points, and shut them out completely in the second half. I am nervous when it comes to this Chargers offensive line vs. the Texans defensive line, but Justin Herbert is out to avenge his disappointing showing vs. the Texans in the playoffs last year. While the Chargers offensive line frightens me, this Texans offense can frighten me at times, too. Seeing the two-win Las Vegas Raiders keep it close with C.J. Stroud in Houston last week was pretty rattling. I'll take the team that is 4-0 SU and ATS over the last four games …  Prediction: Chargers 17, Texans 13\nDubin (Chargers -1.5): L.A.'s defense briefly looked like it might allow last week's game against the Cowboys to turn into a shootout, but then held Dallas to zero second-half points and turn it into a blowout instead. The Texans had been playing much better offensively in recent weeks but took a significant step backward on Sunday against a Raiders team that doesn't stop anybody. That's not encouraging heading into a game against Jesse Minter's unit. The Chargers could struggle to move the ball as well against Houston's banshee-like defense, but I think they come away with a win either way. … Prediction: Chargers 20, Texans 17Baltimore Ravens at Green Bay Packers (-3) (Saturday)\nDajani (Packers -3): I'm not sweating the Packers quarterback situation, whether it's Jordan Love or Malik Willis. Similar to the Broncos, I think the Packers are going to be motivated to get back on track following the shocking collapse to the Chicago Bears. The Ravens just haven't been the Ravens we've come to know and love recently. Lamar Jackson's status again is in question after he took a knee to the back against the Patriots. Even if he does play, he's thrown just eight touchdowns compared to five interceptions over the last eight games, and has lost six games as a starter for the first time in his career. This season has unfortunately been defined by injury for him, and Baltimore is not a legitimate contender. The jury is still out for Green Bay, who has home-field advantage this week …  Prediction: Packers 24, Ravens 17Dubin (Packers -3): This is a placeholder pick until we find out which quarterbacks are playing. If Lamar Jackson is in and Jordan Love is out, I'm taking the Ravens. If both teams are playing backups, though, give me Green Bay.  … Prediction: Packers 23, Ravens 16\nSeattle Seahawks (-7) at Carolina Panthers\nDajani (Seahawks -7): This is a tough game to pick. As I said last week, you have a better chance of winning the Powerball than figuring out what the Panthers are -- especially when playing at home. Seriously, this Panthers team lost by 31 points to the Buffalo Bills at home in October, then upset Matthew Stafford and the Rams in Bank of America Stadium the following month. The Panthers got swept by the New Orleans Saints this season, but found a way to beat Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers as underdogs last week. The Seahawks are certainly inconsistent as well, as they needed a game-winning field goal to beat grandpa Rivers in Week 15, but won a shootout with the Rams in Week 16. Keep in mind this is a revenge game for Sam Darnold, and I imagine the Mike Macdonald defense will have the upper hand on Bryce Young …  Prediction: Seahawks 24, Panthers 14Dubin (Seahawks -7): Seattle got its offense going -- finally -- in the second half against the Rams last Thursday, and should have a better chance of maintaining consistent production throughout the game against a weaker Panthers defense. I don't see any way that Carolina's going to be able to corral Jaxon Smith-Njigba, for example. On the other side of the ball, I simply do not trust Bryce Young against Mike Macdonald's defense. Freed from having to go up against Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua, that unit should bounce back in a big way, generate a bunch of pressure, and frustrate a young, inconsistent passer. Unless Carolina totally controls the game with the run (unlikely given that Seattle ranks first in yards allowed per carry), I don't see this one being all that close. … Prediction: Seahawks 27, Panthers 13Philadelphia Eagles at Buffalo Bills (-1.5)\nDajani (Eagles +1.5): Yes, the Bills are a legitimate contender with the reigning NFL MVP at quarterback, but I have some concerns about this defense. The Bills have the third-worst run defense in the NFL, allowing 144.3 rushing yards per game. Buffalo allows 5.4 yards per rush -- which ranks second-worst in the NFL. According to CBS Sports Research, those 5.4 yards per rush allowed ranks second-worst among playoff teams since 1970, and the Bills have already allowed the most 30-yard rushing touchdowns in a season in NFL history with eight. Whoa. I'm looking at Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley to have big games ... Prediction: Eagles 27, Bills 24\nDubin (Bills -1.5): I have all the same concerns about Buffalo's defense. I'm definitely worried about Saquon Barkley potentially going off for a huge game here... but I also think Josh Allen is going to bounce back in a big way after his muted performance against the Browns may have knocked him out of the inner circle of the MVP race. Couple him with James Cook playing at or near the peak of his powers, I think the Bills will be able to move the ball just as well as the Eagles, and ultimately pull out the win in their home stadium.  … Prediction: Bills 24, Eagles 21Chicago Bears at San Francisco 49ers (-3) (SNF)\nDajani (49ers -3): The first matchup in NFL history between two 11-win teams that are both coming off 11-loss seasons! You have to credit the Bears for one of the most remarkable comebacks I've ever seen last week, but the 49ers are the team no one is talking about. I almost have a tough time admitting they are legitimate Super Bowl contenders given all of the injuries on the defensive side of the ball, but it's clear they can compete with anybody. The reason I'm taking San Francisco in this matchup is because of the offense. Brock Purdy has led the NFL in completion percentage (70.2%), passer rating (110.0) and first down percentage (48%) during this five-game win streak, and threw five touchdowns against the Indianapolis Colts on Monday. As for the Bears defense, I think they are one of the most fascinating units in the NFL this year. They are regarded as a fantastic defense since they lead the NFL in takeaways, but they also rank bottom 10 in yards allowed per game (348.1). For that reason, give me the 49ers at home  …  Prediction: 49ers 30, Bears 23Dubin (49ers -3): The Bears have been pulling rabbits out of their collective hats all year, so going against them here feels at least somewhat risky. That's especially the case because their defense remains one of the most injury-ravaged units in the league. They're better against the run than they are against the pass, though, which helps in a game against the Bears, who lean on the run. San Francisco's offense, meanwhile, looks explosive after the bye. So long as George Kittle is able to suit up and give it a go, I think the Niners have too many weapons offensively to be shut down.  … Prediction: 49ers 24, Bears 20\nLos Angeles Rams (-7.5) at Atlanta Falcons (MNF)\nDajani (Falcons +7.5): Credit to SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White for pointing this out to me: If the Seahawks and 49ers win on Sunday, the Rams are locked into a wild-card spot no matter what. I'm not saying Sean McVay is going to automatically bench all of his starters, but could they be pulled in the fourth quarter or so? The Falcons have been competitive over the past two weeks with wins over the Buccaneers and Arizona Cardinals, and rank second in the NFL in sacks with 50. With the number over a touchdown, I'm going to hold my breath for a back-door cover …  Prediction: Rams 23, Falcons 20Dubin (Rams -7.5): Atlanta has won back-to-back games after dropping seven of eight... but those games have come against the Buccaneers and Cardinals. The Rams, to put it plainly, are not the Bucs and Cardinals. Even without Davante Adams, I expect them to be able to move the ball with relative ease against a Falcons defense that has regressed badly since the beginning of the season. The Rams rank 10th in the NFL in yards allowed per carry and should be able to contain Bijan Robinson from going completely ballistic, and if they can get pressure on Kirk Cousins, I just don't see a way that Atlanta can keep up.  … Prediction: Rams 26, Falcons 17\n            ",

The Dallas Mavericks haven't exactly been lighting the world on fire either, but they're trending in the right direction, and if he keeps growing as much as he has thus far this season, Cooper Flagg has a whole lot more Christmas basketball ahead of him.Given how far down the Western Conference standings both the Mavericks and Warriors have fallen, this is actually a critical game from a play-in and standings perspective. To get you ready, we'll post our best bets below, both against the spread and in terms of props.Mavericks at Warriors: Where to watchTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Chase Center -- San FranciscoTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Warriors -8, O/U: 227.5 (via FanDuel) \n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMavericks at Warriors: Prediction, odds, best bets\nThe Warriors have played nine games thus far in December. They've won just two of them by eight or more points. Draymond Green mysteriously disappeared after a heated exchange with Steve Kerr on Monday. Nobody on this team but Stephen Curry is scoring consistently. Golden State shouldn't be favored by eight points against anyone, let alone a Mavericks team that is frankly playing just about as well as they are. The Pick: Mavericks +8\nHere's a fun fact for you: Cooper Flagg already has 68 points in the clutch. That's almost halfway to the recorded rookie record (138 by Brandon Jennings). The point is that Flagg seems comfortable in big moments. He's going to relish the chance to put on a show against a living legend in Stephen Curry on his home court in a marquee Christmas game. I'm fully expecting him to meet the moment. The Pick: Flagg Over 19.5 Points\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Thursday features a top-15 college basketball Big Ten battle when No. 8 Purdue hosts No. 13 Michigan State, along with 10 NBA games, perfect for claiming the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $200 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins. Purdue has won seven straight at home against Michigan State, but rather than backing a side, the SportsLine Projection Model finds the best value in taking Over 142.5 total points scored in an 8 p.m. ET matchup as one of its Thursday NBA best bets at DraftKings. Michigan State has gone Over in six of its last seven games. The model is also backing the Houston Rockets to cover as 1.5-point favorites on the road against the Orlando Magic for Thursday NBA best bets. One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball pick on South Dakota State vs. Kansas City at 8 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model entered Week 19 on a sizzling 38-18 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookRockets (-1.5) vs. Magic (-115)Michigan State vs. Purdue: Over 142.5 total points (-105)South Dakota State (-11.5) vs. Kansas City (-110)Combining the three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +596 (risk $100 to win $596, odds subject to change). Bet it at DraftKings here:Rockets (-1.5) vs. Magic (-115)The Rockets are coming off back-to-back wins by at least 20 points, defeating the Jazz and Kings and scoring at least 125 points in each contest. Although the Magic are a significantly tougher team than these two, Houston's offensive success could carry over on Thursday in Orlando. The Magic are 25-32 against the spread this season, and the Rockets are 36-21 overall entering a contest where they only need to win by two points to cover the number. Houston center Alperen Sengun had a triple-double with 26 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists on Wednesday, and he'll be a matchup nightmare against for Orlando, which returns home after a cross-country flight and a 110-109 win over the Lakers on Tuesday. The model projects the Rockets to cover in 65% of simulations. Back the Rockets at DraftKings here:Michigan State vs. Purdue: Over 142.5 total points (-105)The Over has hit in six of the last seven Michigan State games and in three of the last four Purdue contests, including back-to-back games, entering Thursday. Five of Michigan State's last seven games have gone Over 142.5 total points as well, and all three of Purdue's recent Overs had at least 143 combined points scored. These are trends the model projects to continue on Thursday as these top-15 ranked teams go head-to-head, with the Over hitting in 77% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:South Dakota State (-11.5) vs. Kansas City (-110)\"It's one thing to be 4-24 and on a 12-game losing streak as Kansas City is, but the truth is that they haven't covered in any of those 12 games,\" SportsLine expert Eric Cohen said. \"KenPom ranks the Roos 355th, 11th-worst in the country, but it's hard to imagine that this sad team would beat anyone below them. At 13-16, South Dakota State isn't all that great, but they did beat UMKC by 28 in mid-January. Expect another 20+ point blowout as we'll continue to ride the trend of fading Kansas City.\" Back South Dakota at DraftKings here:Want more NBA and college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Team USA men's hockey star Brady Tkachuk is not fond of an AI-altered video the White House posted this week to its official TikTok account depicting him belittling Canadians. Tkachuk, who helped guide Team USA to a gold medal in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, said the disparaging remarks in the clip would \"never come out of my mouth.\"The White House's post came after President Donald Trump made what Hilary Knight, the captain of the U.S. women's hockey team, called a \"distasteful\" joke about the women's team, which also defeated Canada to win the gold in Italy.The video shows Tkachuk at a press conference at the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off and references Canadian fans booing the United States national anthem at the tournament. Tensions between the two countries were high during last February's event after Trump announced he would impose tariffs against Canada.\"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup-eating f---s a lesson,\" Tkachuk was made to say in the doctored video. \"Canada, we own you, little bro.\"\nCanada defeated the United States in the 4 Nations Face-Off final.\"It's clearly fake, because it's not my voice and not my lips moving,\" Tkachuk said Thursday at an Ottawa Senators media availability. \"I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. Can't do anything about it.\"\n        \n            \n                U.S. women's hockey team captain Hilary Knight responds to President Trump's 'distasteful' joke\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTkachuk plays professionally in Canada and said the thought of not playing north of the border has never crossed his mind. He has spent the first seven years of his NHL career in Ottawa after the Senators selected him with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2018 draft.A reporter asked Tkachuk if he liked the White House's video.\"It's not my voice, not what I was saying,\" Tkachuk said. \"I would never say that. That's not who I am. So I guess I don't like that video because that just would never come out of my mouth. Never thought. I'll leave it at that.\"\nTkachuk also denied that he was the individual who told Trump to \"close the northern border\" when the President called the men's hockey team after its win over Canada in Sunday's Olympic final.\"I've been seeing stuff that people think it's me, but if you watch the video, that's not my voice and something that I'd never say,\" Tkachuk said. \"I don't really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here and give everything I have here. I just think that's something that never a thought would happen in my head and especially would never say it. It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. Of course, I would never say anything like that.\"The men's hockey team attended the State of the Union address on Tuesday after receiving an invitation from Trump. The women's team declined its invitation.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NBA Hall of Famer and Miami Heat legend Chris Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" after a recent health scare. Bosh revealed Wednesday in a video posted to social media that he woke up covered in his own blood. Bosh, who is still recovering from the ordeal, said the incident occurred when he was getting ready for a date with his wife.\"Next thing you know, I was on the ground,\" Bosh said. Bosh doesn't remember anything other than waking up covered in his own blood. He declined to offer specifics about what exactly caused the medical event, but did go into further detail on his Substack, \"The Last Chip.\"\"I was walking from my closet into the bathroom, getting ready for an evening out, when my body turned on me,\" Bosh wrote. \"A numbing sensation shot down my left leg, that sharp, electric feeling you get when you bump your funny bone. Before I knew it, I was on the floor. I slowly came to in a pool of my own blood while my wife frantically spoke with 911. I tried to move my body the way I always had, and it didn't respond.\"\nBosh explained how the \"terrifying\" moment helped change his outlook on life.\n\"After coming back from the darkness, there was no euphoric clarity,\" Bosh wrote. \"... What did change was an immediate outlook on life that was simpler and more honest.\"Bosh retired from the NBA in 2019 after not having played since 2016 due to another health-related issue. Bosh suffered from recurring blood clots that cut his career short. It was first discovered in 2015, when a blood clot that started in his leg and traveled to one of his lungs ended his season after just 44 games. He returned the following season (2015-16), but a second blood clot was found, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season after playing 53 games.After several medical evaluations, Heat team doctors failed Bosh on his physical ahead of the 2016-17 decision despite his desire to play. It was determined that it would be too dangerous for him to continue his basketball career. He retired at 31, having won two championships with the Heat and earning 11 All-Star selections. In 2019, the Heat retired his jersey after playing six of his 13 years with the team. Bosh was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" and plans to use this moment to share his experiences with others.\n\"This experience motivated me to start writing again, to share my experiences and stories in the hope that we can get something out of it and grow together,\" Bosh wrote.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers did not fare well in the NFL Players Association's annual team report cards. For the first time, the Steelers came in last place, according to ESPN, which obtained the survey results after the league won a grievance to stop the NFLPA from making the report cards public.The survey -- based on responses from 1,759 players -- had the Miami Dolphins ranked first, the Minnesota Vikings second and the Washington Commanders third. For a second straight year, the Cleveland Browns ranked 30th among the NFL's 32 teams. Miami reportedly ranked fourth overall in home field due to the quality of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium. Former Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel (now the offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers) received a B grade a year after getting an A+ in the survey. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said of the Dolphins' coaching situation. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL wins grievance against NFLPA, putting an end to public yearly team report cards\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nElsewhere, the Steelers reportedly received low grades in several categories, including having the lowest-rated home field in the NFL \"by a wide margin.\" Pittsburgh shares its home field with the University of Pittsburgh and plays on a field that hosts high school playoff games. All of that activity typically leads to less-than-ideal playing surfaces for the Steelers and their opponents. The Steelers' locker room received an F, as players stated that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\" Steelers president Art Rooney ranked last in the league for \"willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board.\" \nIn the past, Rooney has downplayed the NFLPA's annual survey. \"It doesn't get presented to us, it gets presented to the media, so as far as I'm concerned it's a media opportunity for the players association as opposed to a serious effort of constructive criticism,\" Rooney said in 2024. In its grievance, the NFL stated that the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. An arbitrator agreed while stating that the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses from the report cards even if it was unable to publish them. A spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment to ESPN. An NFL spokesperson also declined to comment while stating that, like the last four years of the NFLPA's report cards, the league had no knowledge of the survey.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first round of the Florida Swing produced a little bit of everything. Numerous players attempted shots from water hazards, a worrying withdrawal came from one of the game's more popular figures, and even a bird was clipped by the pre-tournament favorite. Unaffected by all of it was none other than Austin Smotherman, who opened his 2026 Cognizant Classic with a sensational 9-under 62 to command the first-round lead by a single stroke over Nico Echavarria.\"Two weeks off, I come out here today excited to play,\" Smotherman said. \"I'm glad I was an early tee time today, too, not having to wait around and maybe see other guys doing what they're doing. But I just wanted to get on the golf course. Felt like the game was in a good spot. \"To be honest, I didn't play a ton when I was home -- just took the rest when I could, knowing I'm about to play as many weeks as I can until my wife is due with our third child here March 23rd. Figuring things out on the road solo this week, and the game kind of followed. It was a pretty easy round on a golf course that shouldn't be this easy. It felt pretty good.\"Smotherman started his tournament with a couple of birdies in his first five holes before he caught fire around the turn. He made six birdies in a row from Nos. 7-12 to catapult himself into a share of the lead. A birdie on the par-5 finisher made it so his name was the one to finish Thursday alone at the top.\nWhile Smotherman and some of his peers enjoyed calm conditions in the morning, five-time major champion Brooks Koepka and those off in the afternoon faced a different challenge. With wind picking up as the day progressed, players were tasked with navigating a more difficult PGA National, albeit still a relatively tame one historically.Experiencing two frustrating tournaments on the West Coast courtesy of some serious putting woes, Koepka came into the Cognizant Classic with some renewed enthusiasm on the greens. However, continuing to wield the TaylorMade Spider putter, he continued to see the same results.The Florida native turned in a round of 3 over, hindered by both his play on the greens and the manner in which he finished. Koepka's most noteworthy connection came from 36 feet on the par-4 6th for the first of two birdies. Unfortunately, his second-longest putt from 5 feet, 5 inches came on the par-3 17th for a double-bogey five, which was sandwiched in between two other fives on the scorecard.\n\"He shot 3 over, so I don't think he played his best,\" Daniel Berger said of Koepka. \"Obviously had a difficult time on 17, but if there's one thing I know, it's he can turn it around in an instant. I expect him to come out tomorrow and play well.\"\nLeader1. Austin Smotherman (-9): If you're going to shoot 62 at PGA National, you are going to make your fair share of putts, and that is exactly what Smotherman did. The 31-year-old made 132 feet of putts, gained over three strokes with the flat stick in hand and did so while 17 greens in regulation. The latter will be the most important on Friday as he goes off in the afternoon when conditions are expected to freshen.\"I felt like I just wanted to hit good putts on the high line all day and just very freeing,\" Smotherman said. \"I'm using no line on the golf ball this week for the first time in a while, but I felt like it kind of just helps with these greens. There's so much movement and the pace that they are, and then with the wind, not to be adjusting and so conscientious of that line, so I felt like that was pretty freeing. \n\"The length of putts that I was making was nice to see, but I also felt like I hit a lot of good putts. The par save on 15 to kind of keep things going, a par save as well on 6 after a bad lag putt, that kind of kept things going. So having those things happen and then a long putt goes in, you're stealing them, and then you hit one close, and you just keep building those holes. Before you know it, you're finished, and here we are.\"\nContenders2. Nico Echavarria (-8)T3. Taylor Moore, Jackson Suber, Daniel Berger, Kevin Roy, Kristoffer Reitan (-4)T8. Keith Mitchell, Joel Dahmen, Michael Brennan, Aaron Rai and nine others (-3)It was not Smotherman who led the field in strokes gained putting on Thursday but rather Echavarria. The two-time PGA Tour winner has missed four cuts in five starts to begin his 2026 season with his lone weekend appearance coming as a top 10 finish at Pebble Beach. Despite the volatility, Echavarria insisted that his game was close, and Thursday was proof of that as he too went around PGA National without a dropped shot.\n\"It wasn't the best start of the year, but I did play very, very well in Pebble, and those signature events give you a lot of points, so I'm happy with that,\" Echavarria said. \"The golf hasn't been that far off, and I could tell today that having patience and just enjoying it out there was going to be the key for the day, and we did that.\"\nHow players are reacting to PGA NationalFrom 2006-23, 11 golfers shot 10 under or better at PGA National. In 2025, 38 players accomplished the feat with Jake Knapp even shooting 59. Now, there were some changes between those two periods, including the golf course being overseeded and the par-4 10th getting changed to a par 5, which adjusts a player's score to par. Still, though, if last year (and Thursday) was any indication of the difficulty of this golf course, it may be fair to say that this is officially not your father's PGA National. So, why is that? Just ask Billy Horschel, a Florida native who has been vocal about what has transpired at the venue.\n\"I talked about it last year. This is a really good golf course. It's a very fair golf course. When it blows hard, it's a challenge, and when it's sort of benign like it is today, it's gettable,\" Horschel explained. \"A few years ago, the rough was longer and then they started cutting it down and then they overseeded the golf course. Listen, I think the Tour gets a bad rap, and it's not anything against the owners of PGA National. I understand where they would want to overseed. …This isn't just PGA National; it goes to a lot of courses that we play throughout the years.\"\nWorrying withdrawal from Will ZalatorisWell, at least it is not his back, but a withdrawal shortly before his Round 1 tee time has some worrying about Zalatoris. According to the PGA Tour, Zalatoris' exit was due to a left ankle injury as the wiry right-hander was on the practice facilities at PGA National, gearing up for first-round action before pulling his name off the tee sheet.Zalatoris opened his season with a top-20 finish at The American Express before he missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open. Once a consistent contender in major championships, Zalatoris has dropped to No. 252 in the Official World Golf Rankings and is not qualified for any of the four major championships for the 2026 season.\n2026 Cognizant Classic updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookNico Echavarria: 9/2Austin Smotherman: 5-1Daniel Berger: 12-1Kristoffer Reitan: 12-1Keith Mitchell: 20-1Rasmus Højgaard: 24-1Kevin Roy: 24-1The morning should play easier on Friday once again, which will create an opportunity for someone like Michael Brennan to inch towards the lead. The PGA Tour rookie is listed at 35-1 after an opening 68 during which he hit 12 of 14 fairways to complement his jaw-dropping length off the tee. The short game was a little sloppy, but if he cleans that up, he will have a chance heading into the weekend.\n            ",

The Colts met with Richardson's agent Deiric Jackson on Thursday morning and they mutually agreed that it was best for both parties to look into all available options. If his fifth-year option is not used, the 2023 No. 4 overall pick has one season left on his rookie contract.Last year, Richardson was beat out by Daniel Jones in the preseason for the starting QB job. With the former New York Giants quarterback expected to be the starter again, Richardson's future with the Colts can best be described as uncertain.Richardson's career has been defined by injuries. The 23-year-old has been with the Colts for three seasons but has only appeared in 17 games with 15 starts.In his first year with the team, Richardson played just four games, going 2-2 with 577 yards, three touchdowns, one interception, 136 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground. An injury to his throwing shoulder ended his rookie season prematurely.\nHe's also dealt with hip, back and foot injuries that caused him to miss a total of three games in 2024.Last October, during warmups ahead of their Week 6 game, Richardson sustained an orbital fracture that required surgery after a freak accident with a stretching band. The injury caused him to miss 12 games last season, but according to ESPN, doctors \"indicate his vision has been restored.\"This week, Colts general manager Chris Ballard said Richardson has been cleared to play football. \nRichardson certainly still has a lot of his career left and could get a fresh start with a new team. Recently the NFL has seen numerous quarterbacks struggle with one team and find a resurgence later in their career. The most recently display of this is Super Bowl champion Sam Darnold, who bounced around the league, playing for four teams before finding the ultimate success with the Seattle Seahawks.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Premier League chief executive Richard Masters warned that the sport \"cannot rely\" on star players to maintain their level of performance amid an expanding football calendar that he believes leaves domestic competitions in need of protection.Star players such as Chelsea's Cole Palmer, described as shattered by the head of English footballers' union, find themselves in a position where they may be playing in major tournaments in three straight summers, the 2026 World Cup coming on the back of a Club World Cup in the United States last summer and the European Championships in the previous year.During the regular season, the toll on top talent has been somewhat increased by the addition of at least two more games for clubs competing in the Champions League and Europa League, to say nothing of the strain placed on those who compete in an even more competitive Premier League. \"The players at the top level play an enormous number of football matches, and we cannot rely on them to keep performing at the level we want them to,\" said Masters at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit. \"What I never want [is] any of our clubs [thinking] that the Premier League isn't their number one priority or for the players to fill the Premier League isn't the number one priority, because they have too many other matches to distract them. 'I'm gonna take a breather this week. I'm prioritizing myself for another competition.' \n\"At the moment, the Premier League is number one, I believe, for all of our clubs, and that's what keeps it strong. We want that to remain the case, both in terms of the managers, the shareholders, and also the players.\"The expansion of European games has had a knock-on effect on an English football calendar that already allowed itself little room for maneuver with logistical nightmares created in recent seasons when those competing on the continent go deep in the EFL Cup. In April 2024, English Football Association was also forced to scrap replays in the FA Cup from the first round onwards, the governing body specifically citing UEFA competitions as a contributory factor to the decision.For Masters' part, he noted that it has become increasingly difficult to schedule Premier League games around clubs' other involvement. That reality is not aided by the remarkable success of England on the continent. At the time of writing, all nine clubs that qualified for the competitions are still active, including six of the remaining 16 teams in the Champions League.\n\"It's a serious concern,\" said Masters of the expanding calendar. \"What we're seeing is continued expansion of regional and international football. In the last 2 years alone, we've seen the relaunching of the UC3 programme with many more European games our clubs are on our participating in. We've seen a Club World Cup launched and we're seeing a much bigger World Cup this summer. All of those decisions, many are unconsulted on, particularly at FIFA level. [With] UEFA, we have that dialogue, not so we agree with all of it, and we're now starting to feel some of that. \"It is incredibly hard to schedule the Premier League to meet all of our broadcast obligations, to keep all of our clubs happy at the same time, as accommodating nine clubs in Europe. It's a real problem. Um, so we have to be aware of that and we have to work very closely ... with UEFA or you have to stay close as leagues because these don't just impact the Premier League, they impact on all of us.\"Domestic competitions need protection. We're going to see the new expanding World Cup in all of its glory. We're looking forward to that. The World Cup is a great thing. Obviously, it's become controversial. We're gonna see how it's all gonna pan out over the summer.\"\nMasters' concerns were echoed by Maheta Molango, chair of English footballers' union, the PFA, and a vice-president on its worldwide counterpart FIFPRO. He specifically cited the case of Palmer, who has been limited to 19 of a possible 42 club games this season as he battles with groin issues and a broken toe. In the previous season, Palmer played 4,247 minutes across 52 matches for Chelsea alone in a season that ran from August 18 2024 to July 13 the following year and the Club World Cup final. That in itself had begun barely a month after a European Championships in which Palmer scored in the final.Molango revealed that he had visited Chelsea's training camp soon after their Club World Cup exertions and that the club had seemed \"shattered.\" \"This is just the reality,\" he said. \"You wonder whether this is what we wanted as an industry. I'm not sure. I think sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.\n\"People say he's a millionaire, yeah, he is, but it doesn't give you an extra lung or an extra leg, and [we have] come to a stage where you know, 'I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he's the one who makes me dream.' The reality is that the fans pay right now 100% of the ticket [price], and a lot of time they get 70% if they're lucky of the show or 60% because players start regulating themselves.\"The Premier League is the best product in terms of football, they make north of £4billion for 38 games. Surely there's an element of valuing the scarcity. Christmas is nice because it's not every Tuesday and I think we need to discover that because we thought in football that more is more. Sometimes less is more.\"\n            ",

Under a new recommendation, players disqualified for targeting for the first time during the season will be allowed to play in their next game, regardless of which half the targeting penalty occurs. Under the current rule, a player disqualified in the second half of a game for targeting has to sit out the first half of the subsequent game. If the rule changes, any player disqualified for targeting for a second time during the season would miss the first half of their next game. A third disqualification for targeting would result in the offending player being suspended for their next game in full. \"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said rules subcommittee chair A.J. Edds in a statement. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n        \n            \n                NCAA to discuss targeting rule changes, could make penalty 'less punitive' for 2026 college football season\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe proposal also allows for a conference to initiate an appeals process following a player's second targeting violation. If the appeal is successful, then the player would be allowed to play both halves in their next game. \nThe proposal still has to pass both the FBS and FCS Oversight Committees before it is made official. Both committees are set to meet in March to consider rule proposals. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants could be preparing to part ways with a former first-round pick. The team is listening to offers for edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux, and the belief among teams at the NFL Scouting Combine is that Thibodeaux will get dealt, according to SNY.Thibodeaux, 25, is coming off a season during which he recorded just 2.5 sacks, five tackles for loss and nine quarterback hits while playing in only 10 of 17 games. He has fallen off precipitously over the last two years after he posted an 11.5-sack season in 2023, his second year in the NFL.But even that 11.5-sack total was not really representative of his level of play that year. Thibodeaux ranked 12th in the NFL in sacks that season but checked in just 67th in pressures and 107th in pressure rate out of the 145 players who rushed the passer 250 times or more. He just happened to have a sack-to-pressure ratio that was an outlier and looks nothing like the one he has posted in the other three seasons of his career. During that 2023 season, 26.7% of Thibodeaux's pressures resulted in sacks. He has otherwise been at 10% (2022), 14.5% (2024) and 7.8% (2025). It's no surprise, then, that he's totaled only 12 sacks in his three non-2023 seasons.\nThat subpar performance could lead to a reduced market for Thibodeau's services. There's also the matter of his fully guaranteed salary of around $14.8 million in 2026, which could even further limit said market. Still, as a 25-year-old former first-round pick, there are teams out there that could be interested. Let's take a look at a few that might make some sense, if the price is right.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersOnly two teams generated pressure at a lower rate during the 2025 regular season than the 49ers, according to Tru Media. (That would be the Jets and the Panthers.) San Francisco losing Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams to injury during the season played a role, but the Niners still need more help on the edge even after you account for getting those guys back. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo BillsThe Bills are seemingly on the hunt for help on the edges every offseason, and this one could be no different. They had a solid pressure rate during the regular season, but in the playoffs it dropped to just 32.5% -- and 28% in the loss to the Broncos in the divisional round. Buffalo has other needs and might be turned off by price, but if it's low enough, it could get interested.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York JetsThe Jets are one of those aforementioned teams that did an even worse job of getting after the quarterback than the 49ers. They could use all they help they can get, so you might as well throw them in the mix here. That's especially true after they traded Jermaine Johnson II to the Titans. They also have plenty of cap space, so they could likely make something happen if they wanted.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersKhalil Mack and Odafe Oweh will hit free agency this offseason, and the Chargers might not be able to bring both of them back. They are scheduled to have over $80 million in cap room, though, so if they wanted to get in on the action for Thibodeaux, they could probably do so at a lower cost than other teams that might want the Giants to absorb some of his cap hit.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe Colts ranked just 23rd in pressure rate during the 2025 season, according to Tru Media. They need someone to rush the passer opposite Laiatu Latu, who collected 8.5 sacks this past year. They've been looking for pass rush help for a while, and they could be interested in buying low here -- especially if the Giants are willing to eat some of the salary.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Rueben Bain Jr. is widely considered one of the top prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft. The star University of Miami edge rusher dominated throughout the 2025 season, including during the Canes' College Football Playoff run to the National Championship Game, where he picked up a sack against presumptive No. 1 overall pick Fernando Mendoza. But Bain is also somewhat of a polarizing prospect because he does not have the prototypical size for his position. In fact, he has an extremely atypical size, as we saw on Thursday morning when the NFL conducted measurements for edge rushers at the NFL Scouting Combine. Bain's arms measured just 30 7/8 inches long, giving him some of the shortest arms for an edge rusher in recent Combine history.Courtesy of Mockdraftable, here's the list of edge rushers with arms that measured 31 inches or shorter since 1999. As you can see, it's not an extensive list, and Bain checks in with the fifth-shortest arms of the entire group. (Pending the measurements for the rest of this class.)\nPlayerYearSchoolArm LengthCashius Howell2026Texas A&M30 1/4\"Nate Williams2013Ohio State30 5/8\"Sutton Smith2019Northern Illinois30 3/4\"Tyree Johnson2022Texas A&M30 7/8\"Rueben Bain Jr.2026Miami30 7/8\"Ricky Elmore2011Arizona31\"Cheta Ozougwu2011Rice31\"Dean Lowry2016Northwestern31\"Wyatt Hubert2021Kansas State31\"Elijah Ponder2021Cincinnati31\"Ethan Downs2025Oklahoma31\"But we also already knew this about Bain entering the week. In fact, it was on our list of the 10 most anticipated storylines for combine week.Bain is considered arguably the top edge rusher in this draft class, but he's also one of its most polarizing prospects. He plays with incredible power and has the production to match his reputation, but NFL teams prioritize measurements on the edge and Bain is likely to fall short of some bench marks when he has his arms measured. How short he falls and whether teams decide to care a lot about that will be one of the biggest stories of the week.Now, here we are. Bain measured in with the same T-rex-style arms many expected him to have. The question is, does it really matter? For Bain himself, it's a non-issue. \"People keep bringing that up out of nowhere, but no teams brought it up to me, so I don't bring it up either,\" Bain said, via ESPN. \"As long as I just talk the talk and walk the walk, play with technique, nobody actually cares about it.\"When you bring up the list of sack leaders from the 2025 season, though, you do find that a player like Bain (or Howell, for that matter) would be a significant outlier when it comes to sack production if he were to succeed on that level. That's likely to matter to (some) teams on at least some level.\nOf course, there is more to being an edge rusher than racking up sacks, and anyway, Bain showed throughout his college career that the arm length couldn't stop him from doing that, either. Despite those short arms, Bain was repeatedly able to get inside of tackles' bodies to punch and move them with relative ease. He was able to overpower them at the point of attack, bend around them on the edge and beat them to the inside. He was able to stack and shed them in the run game, making plays at and behind the line of scrimmage. He has a reliable set of moves and counter-moves that complement an elite trait -- his power. Couple that with the speed, quickness, hand placement and more present on his tape and you get an idea of why he was effective enough to rack up the second-most pressures in the country during the 2025 regular season, and why he was perhaps even more devastatingly effective during Miami's playoff run, where he picked up another 24 pressures and five sacks in four games against Texas A&M, Ohio State, Mississippi and Indiana. \nBain will indeed have to be a physical outlier to find great success in the pros, but that was something we already knew before he checked in with these measurements. Teams shouldn't double-count it now just because the measurements are official. They should of course take it into account, just like any other factor in their evaluation, but they shouldn't let it overshadow the tremendous traits and production that made him such a success in college.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While he missed the entire 2025 college football season with a torn ACL, Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy remains perhaps the best cornerback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft class, and he said he is recovered from the injury that held him out during his final year with the Volunteers. His return to full strength opens the door for a potential first-round selection even though he only has two years of college production to his name.Despite being cleared and having \"no limits\" physically, McCoy will not participate at this week's NFL Scouting Combine. He will, however, complete workouts at Tennessee's pro day. McCoy said he elected to pass on the combine because he wants more training time as he seeks to put the best product on the field.\"I was just easing into my training out of college and just trying to make sure everything was good,\" McCoy said at the combine. \"The plan from the jump was for me to do pro day, do all my medicals and stuff to show that I'm healthy.\"McCoy's medicals are one of the biggest storylines at the combine. If all checks out, he could very well be one of the first defensive players taken in April's draft. Any concern over his knee would be grounds for a slide down the board.\nThe cautious approach McCoy took in 2025 could pay off in the form of ideal medical evaluation results. He said he made a push to get back onto the field last season at Tennessee, but while he was cleared to return, he did not feel ready to compete. That did not stop him from declaring for the draft, though, and the film he produced over one year at Tennessee and another at Oregon State is enough to warrant first-round projections.\"I got back to training, and I just felt like myself again,\" McCoy said. \"I made a big impact the year that I played. I just felt like I was ready.\"McCoy debuted as a true freshman in 2023 and played in all 12 regular-season games at Oregon State. He was an immediate standout for the Beavers and hauled in two interceptions and a fumble recovery on what was a pleasant surprise of a campaign for the former three-star recruit. That season made him a prized prospect in the 2024 transfer portal, and he made the leap to the SEC with high expectations.\nMcCoy delivered on the buzz with a splendid first year at Tennessee, doubling his interception total with four takeaways in 2024. He broke up an additional nine passes in what ended up being his final year on the college gridiron.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL's new league year doesn't open until Wednesday, March 11 at 4 p.m. ET. That's when teams can officially sign free agents and complete trades – but trades certainly can be agreed upon at any time and one actually has been on Thursday, Feb. 26 between the Jets and Titans. One of the big stories in the NFL this week was regarding the status of Eagles Pro Bowl wideout A.J. Brown and whether he returns to the City of Brotherly Love. We have odds from DraftKings Sportsbook on his next team.Bet on the NFL at DraftKings and get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5+ wins:You likely remember during the 2022 NFL Draft when the Eagles got Brown from the Tennessee Titans in exchange for the 18th and 101st overall picks. That was an utter heist for Philly as the Titans took wideout Treylon Burks at No. 18 and he was a major bust and isn't even with the franchise anymore.Following the trade, Brown signed a four-year, $100 million extension with $57 million guaranteed. And he has been worth it with four straight seasons of at least 1,000 yards receiving, the first Eagles player to accomplish that feat. He's also had at least seven touchdown grabs in each season.Brown clearly grew unhappy last season when the Philadelphia offense struggled as a whole, and his numbers were down a bit. The Eagles finished with their lowest scoring average (22.3), yards per game (311.2) and rush yards per game (116.9) under Nick Sirianni. Thanks to its defense, Philly had six wins while finishing with less than 300 yards of offense. Those were the most such wins in that scenario since the 2007 Chicago Bears. The Eagles had three wins when scoring fewer than 20 points, their most such since 2007.Brown had zero receptions in a half seven times last season. That happened just once in 2024. He was clearly angry on the sidelines multiple times and there were a few arguments to be seen on TV with Sirianni and others as Brown openly expressed his frustration with the offensive operation. He reportedly was shopped ahead of the trade deadline, but the Eagles weren't going to just give the 28-year-old away as they still thought they were contenders to repeat as Super Bowl champions.This week, Sirianni said at the NFL Combine that he wanted Brown back next season but neither he nor general manager Howie Roseman committed to that. Roseman said the team would entertain trade offers for Brown.\"Will A.J. be here next season? I think we're still in a spot, like, I can't guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season. I'm thinking I'm going to be the coach next season, but you can't guarantee anything past tomorrow,\" Sirianni said.  The Eagles would absorb a dead cap hit of over $40 million if they dealt Brown before June 1, compared with less than $20 million if a trade is consummated after that date -- thus, we probably don't see anything happen at least before the draft. The team acquiring Brown would be responsible for his $29 million salary in 2026.Sportsbooks word these player prop futures differently. Some will phrase it as \"Which is A.J. Brown's next team if not the Eagles?\" DraftKings simply asks for Brown's team for next season and includes Philly as the -175 favorite. However, it feels like there's too much smoke there for Brown to return.A.J. Brown next team odds (via DraftKings)Eagles -175Patriots +275Chargers +700Bills +900Titans +1000Raiders +1400Ravens +160049ers +1800Dolphins +1800New England is the clear non-Eagles favorite at +275 and that makes so much sense. For one thing, you know the Eagles would like to ship Brown out of the NFC so he can't torment them in a future postseason. Secondly, the Pats badly need playmakers at wideout, which was made very evident in the blowout loss to Seattle in Super Bowl 60.  Brown began his NFL career with current Pats coach Mike Vrabel in Tennessee and they are still tight. So if Brown has a say in the matter, this marriage makes a lot of sense.Bet NFL futures at FanDuel and get $100 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5+ wins:Veteran Stefon Diggs had a solid year for the Pats and became the team's first 1,000-yard receiver since Julian Edelman in 2019, but he might be released for salary cap reasons. Diggs will see his base salary increase from $2.9 million in 2025 to $20.6 million in 2026 and 2027. His salary cap number jumps from $10.5 million last year to $26.5 million in each of the next two seasons. The 32-year-old really isn't worth that these days. On Monday when I first saw these odds, the Los Angeles Chargers weren't near the top of the board at +2000 but are now +700 as there is currently two times more handle and bets on the Bolts than the next most-wagered club. Justin Herbert has one good wideout in Ladd McConkey, but he's more of a possession guy and not the red-zone threat the 6-2, 225-pound Brown is. Los Angeles has a ton of cap space and wideout Keenan Allen is a free agent.Buffalo (+900) needs a No. 1 wideout more than New England does and obviously trading for Brown would keep him from its AFC East rivals. Since Diggs left Buffalo after the 2023 season, the Bills have not had a receiver cross the 1,000-yard mark.  Would the Eagles accept the Bills' first-round pick sitting at No. 26 overall as adequate compensation?Tennessee (+1000), Las Vegas (+1400) and Miami (+1800) seem like non-starters as all are light years from contention, so why bother giving up assets for a 28-year-old? The Dolphins have risen from +1000 since Monday.Baltimore (+1600) and San Francisco (+1800) offer contending situations. Adding Brown to Zay Flowers (88 catches, 1,211 yards, five TDs in 2025) would give the Ravens a stellar 1-2 punch at wideout around Lamar Jackson. And Brown has a relationship with Derrick Henry from their Titans days. My value pick would be Buffalo as the Bills need to capitalize on Josh Allen's window while he's still playing at an MVP level. With the beating Allen takes due to his physical running style, a major injury could happen at any time. Brandon Beane is also under quite a bit of pressure to win in 2026 after mega-successful coach Sean McDermott was fired and Beane was kept. R.J. White has already broken down 2026 NFL win totals, and Brown likely would add a half-win to certain clubs if dealt.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets are trading edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II to the Tennessee Titans in exchange for nose tackle T'Vondre Sweat, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirms. The trade cannot be processed until March, when the new league year begins. Johnson is a former first-round pick, selected by the Jets with the No. 26 overall pick in 2022 under Robert Saleh. He reunites with Saleh, whom the Titans hired to replace Brian Callahan as coach. The Jets dealt away other first-rounders recently, also shipping off cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys at the trade deadline. Johnson played in 14 games for New York last season, starting 13, and finished with 43 combined tackles, including 22 solo tackles, six quarterback hits and 3.0 sacks. In 47 games across four seasons, the 27-year-old has 131 tackles, 27 quarterback hits and 13 sacks. His best season came in 2023, when his career-best 7.5 sacks helped earn him Pro Bowl honors.  Sweat was a 2024 second-round pick of the Titans, recording 85 tackles and three sacks throughout his first two seasons. The Jets had a need to fill when it came to their run defense, as they allowed the fourth-most rushing yards last year (2,371).\nThe Jets have the No. 2 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft while the Titans hold the fourth selection.Here are Zach Pereles' trade grades:Jets: B+Sweat is a big, big man -- 6-4 and 366 pounds -- but he's more than just heft in the middle. Pro Football Focus rated him as the fifth-best interior defensive lineman in the NFL and the fourth-best against the run in 2025. Though he's not as much of a pass rusher as his now-former fellow Titans interior defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, he's not a complete zero there, either: He had a 9.4% pressure rate, a respectable if not spectacular number. His 74.1 pass rush grade from PFF was 19th out of 112 interior defenders.Sweat isn't a full-time player. He played two-thirds of the Titans' snaps as a rookie, when he appeared in all 17 games, and only about half of their snaps last year. And that number only factors in when he was available; he missed five games due to an ankle injury. That's why landing in New York makes sense. The Jets don't have depth at many spots, but they do have it along the interior of the defensive line. Harrison Phillips is a dependable veteran, and former Browns seventh-round pick Jowon Briggs impressed after being acquired over the summer. It's a solid group for a defense that allowed 46 explosive rushes last year, tied for sixth-most in the NFL.\nMore than anything, though, the Jets get a strong grade for three reasons. First, Sweat still has two more years remaining on his rookie deal; Johnson only has one, and it's his fifth-year option. That's a win for a team in the early days of a rebuild. If Sweat plays well in 2026, he's still cheap in 2027. Second, Sweat (24) is two-and-a-half years younger than Johnson (27). It's not a massive differentiating factor, but it is worth mentioning.Third, the Jets have the No. 2 overall pick in the NFL Draft, and they can clearly set their sights on adding another EDGE defender opposite Will McDonald IV. Arvell Reese leads a strong EDGE group that also includes Rueben Bain and David Bailey. New York, which also has the No. 16 pick (as part of the Gardner trade), the No. 33 pick and the No. 44 pick (as part of the Williams trade) can build in earnest on both sides of the ball. It was a rough first year for Aaron Glenn in the Big Apple, but with a run-stuffing defensive lineman in tow and plenty of draft picks upcoming (including three first-rounders in 2027), brighter days could be ahead.Titans: B-Perhaps we should have seen this coming when, Tuesday, Saleh said, \"[Sweat's] a big man, and he has much faster feet that people realize. Is it going to be easy for him? It's not, it's a lot of work and it is physically demanding to play d-line in our system.\"\nThe Titans desperately needed pass rush help. After Simmons' 11 sacks, the team's sack leaders were Jihad Ward's (five) and Dre'Mont Jones and Jaylen Harrell's (4.5). Ward is entering free agency, and Jones was traded midseason to the Ravens.Whether Johnson can provide that pass-rushing boost is another question. Johnson's 2023 -- under Saleh -- was outstanding, but he tore his Achilles early in 2024, and he wasn't nearly the same in 2025. His 9.5% pressure rate was 110th out of 184 players who rushed the passer at least 200 times. It'd be foolish to write off a player one year after he came back from injury, but it'd also be foolish to write off the injury altogether.The fact that Johnson is going into the fifth-year option of his rookie deal and Sweat still has two more years on his rookie deal does hurt Tennessee's grade a touch.\nSaleh has changed the look of his team dramatically in the weeks since taking the job. This trade came one day after Tennessee released starting center Lloyd Cushenberry and starting safety Xavier Woods. The Titans have the most cap space in the NFL (nearly $100 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap) and the No. 4 pick, which it can still use on a pass rusher or a defensive back or an addition to Cam Ward's offense. Pairing Simmons with a disruptive edge player is a solid strategy, and if Johnson recaptures his 2023 form, it could be much more than that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Big Ten and SEC have submitted a white paper to members of Congress urging lawmakers to reject a proposal that would consolidate college sports media rights under a federally supervised entity, arguing the plan would not deliver the promised revenue gains and could destabilize the conference ecosystem.The nine-page report, obtained Thursday by CBS Sports, directly rebuts a proposal advanced last fall by Saving College Sports (SCS). The group called for pooling the media rights of all 136 Football Bowl Subdivision programs into a single entity, estimating the move could generate roughly $6 billion in incremental revenue through schedule optimization and collective negotiations.The Big Ten and SEC dispute those projections, writing that SCS's claims \"are not supported by any empirical evidence\" and warning that the model would create \"a dangerously unworkable\" structure that introduces new legal and operational risks.The SCS plan -- commissioned by billionaire Texas Tech booster Cody Campbell -- calls for an amendment to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which would allow FBS schools to negotiate media rights collectively. The plan also calls for the creation of a federally appointed body to administer media contracts and manage scheduling. Supporters argue that pooling rights would dramatically increase football revenue and provide significant financial support for Olympic and women's sports, projecting more than a 67% increase in revenue for those programs.\nThe SEC and Big Ten's counterThe two power conferences counter that media growth is already occurring under the current conference-based model. Recent conference renewals led to a 2.8-fold increase in average annual value, matching the NBA's most recent media cycle. The memo states that college football media revenue is projected to surpass SCS's forecast by 2033 without pooling rights or federal oversight.The paper challenges SCS's assertion that the NBA's recent windfall proves aggregation creates value. It argues the league's gains stemmed from market competition and the sale of smaller packages to multiple distributors. Roughly 80% of NBA games are still sold through local agreements rather than a single consolidated package.The Big Ten and SEC also question the logistics of federal administration. The SCS proposal calls for a 14-person committee to oversee negotiations, scheduling and revenue distribution across 136 schools, 26 sports and more than 32,000 games annually. The conferences describe that scope as unworkable and warn that it could erode institutional control over scheduling and rivalries, while imposing uniform national branding at the expense of individual traditions.\nAnother hurdle is the structure of existing contracts among the 10 FBS conferences and Notre Dame. Current media deals run through 2036 on staggered timelines. The white paper argues that breaking or materially altering those agreements to implement pooling would invite legal challenges and undermine long-term investment in the sport.The conferences argue that centralized models have underperformed historically. The NCAA pooled television rights before a 1984 Supreme Court ruling struck down the arrangement. The subsequent College Football Association bundled rights for more than 60 schools in the 1980s but generated less revenue than later conference-level deals. The SEC's first conference-wide agreement in 1996 -- covering 12 schools at $17 million annually -- outperformed the broader CFA package valued at $43.6 million.Under its current deal with ESPN, which runs through 2034, the SEC receives nearly $1 billion annually. The Big Ten collects about $1.1 billion per year in a multi-network agreement through 2030. Over the next decade, those two leagues are projected to roughly double the revenue of the ACC and Big 12 — and significantly outpace the Group of Six conferences.\nThe case for reformSCS supporters argue that disparity underscores the need for reform. American Athletic Conference commissioner Tim Pernetti commissioned a study last year projecting that bundling FBS rights could more than double the current cumulative media value of approximately $3.5 billion annually.\"It's in no way designed to have certain conferences take from others,\" Pernetti told CBS Sports in July. \"This is about creating a larger pie. If there was a way for all media rights revenue to be rolled up and then potentially doubled or tripled, I'm not sure what conference wouldn't sign up for that right now.\"President Donald Trump installed Campbell to lead his Commission on College Sports in the summer. He appeared in television advertisements during college football games in the fall, urging stakeholders to consider Saving College Sports' proposal. In response to the Big Ten and SEC's white paper on Thursday, he reiterated that college sports are \"broken and those who first made the mess and profit handsomely from the status quo do not want to fix it.\"\nHe also directly addressed Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti and SEC commissioner Greg Sankey.\"The posture of these two commissioners indicates that they do not care about the fate of the other conferences or smaller schools, nor do they care about the life-changing opportunity provided to women and to athletes in our Olympic sports,\" Campbell said on X. \"It seems they have chosen to disregard the directives of the President and the will of the American people.    Change is difficult, I get that, especially when it means dismantling a long-held, broken, backwards system.  My sincere hope is that, instead of throwing up roadblocks to our congressional momentum, we can work together on solutions that put the student athletes first and preserves (sic) the viability of the great American institution of college sports.\"The Sports Broadcasting Act currently prohibits colleges from collectively pooling media rights. A proposal to amend the law gained traction in Washington last fall, though no congressional hearings have been scheduled.\nFederal involvement in college sports has expanded in recent years, with conference and NCAA leaders visiting Washington to lobby for reforms -- including antitrust protections -- ahead of last year's House settlement requiring schools to share revenue with athletes.The proposed SAFE Act would grant limited antitrust protections to allow collective media negotiations and establish a federally structured oversight model for certain aspects of college sports. The SCORE Act would create a national framework for NIL regulation and athlete compensation standards, further codifying the House settlement reached last year.\n            ",

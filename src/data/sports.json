    "body": "\nA divisional rivalry will, fittingly, resume in the 2026 NFL divisional round as the Seattle Seahawks (14-3) host the San Francisco 49ers (12-5) on Saturday. These teams both began and ended the regular season versus one another with the Niners winning at Seattle in Week 1, while the Seahawks won at San Fran in Week 18. The latter contest notched the No. 1 seed in the 2026 NFL playoffs for the Seahawks in the NFC as they are coming off a bye. The Niners, meanwhile, are coming off a 23-19 road upset of Philadelphia in a Sunday Wild Card matchup. Sam Darnold (oblique) is listed as questionable for Seattle.Kickoff is at 8 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in Seattle. The Seahawks are 7-point favorites in the latest Seahawks vs. 49ers odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 44.5.

The Niners also covered in that contest, and Seattle has lost versus the spread in each of its last two home games as the Seahawks are 8-1 ATS on the road but just 4-4 ATS at home. The 49ers have a top 10 offense in both points scored and total yards, and they rank No. 1 in the all-critical third-down offense. They also have the turnover differential edge over Seattle, as the Seahawks' 28 giveaways were the second-most in the regular season. San Fran can also rely on proven postseason performer like Brock Purdy, who is 5-1 in postseason games he's started and finished, while Darnold had two turnovers and lost in his lone playoff game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Bet Brock Purdy to go Over 231.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\nWhy the Seahawks can coverOf the three previous times that Seattle earned a No. 1 seed, it advanced to the Super Bowl each time. That will bring it confidence, as will defeating San Francisco, 13-3, when it last took the field in Week 18. That tied for the fewest points by the Niners since Kyle Shanahan's debut season in 2017, and now San Fran will have to adjust to life without George Kittle (Achilles) while facing Seattle's No. 1 scoring defense. Additionally, the NFL schedule makers didn't do San Francisco any favors with giving it a short week after a Sunday Wild Card game on the other coast in Philadelphia.

    "body": "\n        Only one ticket to the AFC Championship will be punched on Sunday afternoon when the Houston Texans and New England Patriots duke it out from Foxborough in the divisional round. Both clubs emerged out of wild card weekend victorious, thanks largely to some tremendous efforts on the defensive side of the ball. Against Pittsburgh, Houston engulfed Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers offense, holding them to just six points in a blowout win that saw two touchdowns scored by the defense. They also allowed Pittsburgh to move the chains on just two of its 14 third-down opportunities. Meanwhile, New England had an equally stellar day defensively in its win over the Chargers. They were able to take down Justin Herbert six times in the winning effort, while holding the L.A. offense to a mere field goal. With those defenses hitting their strides, it poses quite a challenge for two of the brightest young quarterbacks that the league has to offer, C.J. Stroud and Drake Maye. For Stroud, this is his third consecutive year advancing to the divisional round, but he has stopped short of a conference championship berth in his prior two visits to this playoff plateau. As for Maye, he's looking to become the eighth-youngest quarterback all-time to win a divisional round game. So, the stage is set quite nicely for a heck of a game at Gillette Stadium. Before we dive further into this matchup, however, let's make sure you have all the information you need to check out this game. \nWhere to watch Texans vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 18 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough)TV: ESPN, ABC | Stream: fubo, try for freeOdds: Patriots -3, O/U 40.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nKey questionsCan the left side of Patriots OL hold up?\nThe left side of New England's offensive line -- spearheaded by rookies Will Campbell (left tackle) and Jared Wilson (left guard) -- had a game to forget against the Chargers last week. Campbell finished his evening allowing five total pressures to go along with a sack, while Wilson also gave up five pressures and two sacks. No bueno. Drake Maye was hurried quite a bit in that game, which contributed to his two turnovers (an interception and a fumble). The challenge only gets tougher now that they'll have to fend off a lethal Texans pass rush headlined by Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter. Houston finished second in the NFL with a 42.5% pressure rate this season, and if they can get to Maye early and often, it'll drastically tip the scales in the Texans' favor.   Will C.J. Stroud protect the football? \nWhat got lost during Houston's dominating win over the Steelers on Monday night was that Stroud had a bad game. While the Texans dropped 30 points for the game, 13 of those points were scored by the defense. The most jarring aspect of Stroud's performance was his inability to protect the football. He threw an ill-advised interception in the red zone and had five total fumbles in the game (two lost). The two lost fumbles were strip sacks, and while some blame can be put on the shoulders of the offensive line in that regard, Stroud also held onto the ball too long at times, which allowed the Pittsburgh pass rush to get home. He also appeared to have some miscommunication with his center, which also saw the ball hit the turf. Stroud was fortunate to have his defense bail him out, as they allowed just three points on his three turnovers. If he gives the ball away this time around with MVP contender Drake Maye on the other side, it could be a different story. Has New England's defense actually leveled up?One of the big takeaways from New England's win over the Chargers was just how dominant their defense was. While we've come to expect that kind of brilliance from Houston's unit, the Patriots' defense seemed to level up against Los Angeles. They held Justin Herbert and Co. to just three points, sacked him six times, and allowed just one conversion on 10 third-down attempts. While that's outstanding, it is fair to wonder just how much of that domination was due to the Patriots' evolving play and how much to the Chargers not being ready for the moment. After all, the L.A. offensive line had been in shambles all season after losing both star tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, and Herbert was one of the most pressured quarterbacks in the league during the regular season. However, if this is a sign that this New England defense has gone up a level, it raises their ceiling remarkably. \nX factor\nWhile there's no official word yet, it does appear as if the Texans will be without their No. 1 pass-catching weapon in Nico Collins, after he left Monday's matchup due to a concussion. That's a big blow to the offense, but Houston did see veteran Christian Kirk step up in that playoff win over Pittsburgh, catching eight of his nine targets on the night for 144 yards and a touchdown. They'll need another performance like that for the Texans to confidently move the ball with any regularity. If he cannot, and no other pass catcher steps up, that'll once again see Stroud hold onto the ball far longer than he should and open the door for New England's pass rushers to take him down throughout the game. Texans vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nHouston's pass rush is a real challenge for the Patriots' offensive line. However, I think New England's defense could prove just as big an adversary for C.J. Stroud, especially if he does not have Collins. It looks like the Patriots will have star corner Christian Gonzalez for this matchup after he also suffered a concussion on Sunday, further emboldening the idea that this New England unit can shut down the Texans' offense and potentially create a turnover or two. If Stroud coughs the football up, the Patriots should be able to capitalize more than Pittsburgh was able to a week ago. On top of that, this is also a tough spot for the Texans from a scheduling perspective. They just had to play on the road in Pittsburgh, fly back to Houston, and then jump back on the plane to head to New England, all on the short week. That's a lot of adversity to overcome, so I see the Patriots advancing to the AFC Championship. \nPrediction: Patriots 24, Texans 20 | Pick: Patriots -3\n            ",

The game kicked off at 3 p.m. ET. The LA Bowl, which saw Washington defeat Boise State 38-10, kicked off at 3:30 p.m. This was an unusual situation, as Army vs. Navy is played a week after conference championship games and, for many years, with no other football games in the time slot. CBS Sports has been the broadcaster of Army vs. Navy since 1996 and holds the rights until 2038.Trump's full Truth Social post:\n\"The Army-Navy Game is one of our Greatest American Traditions - Unmatched Patriotism, Courage, and Honor! This incredible Tradition is now at risk of being pushed aside by more College Playoff Games, and Big TV Money. NOT ANYMORE!\"Under my Administration, the second Saturday in December belongs to Army-Navy, and ONLY Army-Navy! I will soon sign a Historic Executive Order securing an EXCLUSIVE 4 hour Broadcast window, so this National Event stands above Commercial Postseason Games. No other Game or Team can violate this Time Slot!!!   \"On the field, they are rivals, but on the battlefield they are America's unstoppable Patriots, defending our Country with tremendous Strength and Heart. We must protect the Tradition, and the Players, who protect us. Please let this serve as Notice to ALL Television Networks, Stations, and Outlets. God Bless America, and God Bless our great Army-Navy Game!!!\"Trump's statement does not specify whether the order will extend beyond football games to include other sports scheduled for early December. However, his reference to postseason football could imply more than bowl games. As reported by CBS Sports, some proposals to expand the College Football Playoff to 24 teams include moving Army vs. Navy up a week to the first Saturday in December.An executive order \"has the force of law within the executive branch,\" Jill Hasday, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota, explained in a 2017 interview with CBS News. Trump has used them extensively in his second term, setting a record for orders issued in the first 100 days after retaking the presidency in January 2025. Executive orders carry over to subsequent presidents, though they may be overturned.\nThe Army-Navy game has been played annually, uninterrupted, since 1930, though the rivalry began in 1890. Navy currently holds the series lead at 64-55-7. President Trump attended the most recent edition of the historic rivalry. The first president to attend the game was Theodore Roosevelt in 1901.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Despite reports regarding Matt LaFleur's uncertain future following the Green Bay Packers' 31-27 wild-card loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFL Playoffs, the Packers have agreed to terms on a contract extension with their coach, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones on Saturday. ESPN reported that it is a multi-year contract and \"not a prove-it deal but a real commitment\" to LaFleur as the lead man in Green Bay.LaFleur is 76-40-1 in Green Bay with six postseason appearances in seven years -- with a 3-6 overall record in the playoffs. The coach said after the loss in Chicago that he wanted to remain with the Packers. Green Bay conceded an 18-point lead in the second half despite four touchdown passes from franchise quarterback Jordan Love.\"Of course [I want to return]. This is one of one,\" LaFleur said. \"I love this place. I love the people. As much as you guys drive me nuts sometimes, I love you guys. I love our players, the locker room, everybody in our organization. I mean, this is a unique place. The community has been outstanding. I grew up in the Midwest and it's got the same type of vibe that I grew up [with] in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. \"So, people are just -- unless you're from here, you don't understand, I think, how friendly everybody is. And it's nice no matter who you are, you're walking down the street, and people say hello to one another. I've lived other places, so I think this is a unique place, this is a special place. My kids love it here, my family loves it here.\"\nLove gave LaFleur his seal of approval after the Packers' ill-fated fourth quarter against the Bears, who scored 25 points in the final frame to win.\"Yeah, I definitely think Matt should be the head coach. I've got a lot of love for Matt. I think he does a great job. And that's it,\" Love said.\nLaFleur is currently the Packers' fourth-winningest coach with 76 victories, trailing only Vince Lombardi (89), Mike McCarthy (125) and Curly Lambeau (209). His 76 regular-season wins are tied for the second-most by a coach in his first seven seasons in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Paul Brown.\n            ",

They've added Jose Paradela, Agustin Palavecino, and Jeremy Marquez to the midfield in a clear goal of building a more balanced squad. Cruz haven't won the league since 2021 despite collecting the most points of any team in 2024-25 because their high-powered attack wasn't balanced by the rest of the team.With Liga MX having playoffs at the end of the season, points only mean so much when you'll have to take out the top sides in the league, and that's where Cruz Azul have struggled. Manager Nicolas Larcamon will be tasked with figuring out that puzzle, but an improved Puebla side won't go down easily, even with this being an away match for them. Cruz will be without Andres Montano, Jesus Orozco, and Kevin Mier but they also haven't lost to Puebla since 2023.It's expected for it to be an easy win for Cruz Azul but they have to ensure that they take the match seriously because Puebla will make it a fight. \nLiga MX schedule and scoresAll times EasternFriday, Jan. 16Mazaltan 1, Monterrey 5Saturday, Jan. 17Necaxa vs. Atlas, 6 p.m.Chivas Guadalajara vs. Querétaro, 6:07 p.m.Tigres UNAL vs. Toluca, 8 p.m.Cruz Azul vs. Puebla, 10:05 p.m. on CBS Sports Golazo NetworkClub Tijuana vs. Atletico San Luis, 10:06 p.m.\nSunday, Jan. 18Pumas UNAM vs. Club Leon, 1 p.m.Santos Laguna vs. Juarez, 6 p.m.Pachuca vs. Club America, 8 p.m.\n            ",

The scoring spree for the Broncos started when Bo Nix hit Lil'Jordan Humphrey for a 29-yard touchdown pass with just 22 seconds left to play in the first half. \nThe scoring play gave the Broncos a 17-10 lead. After the ensuing kickoff, the Bills took over on their own 30-yard line with just 16 seconds left in the second quarter, and at that point, it probably would have made sense to just let the half in, but instead, the Bills tried to make something happen. On a first-and-10 play, Josh Allen couldn't find an open receiver, so he decided to scramble and he ended up fumbling after taking a hit from Nik Bonitto. \nThe Broncos recovered the ball with two seconds left in the first half, which was just enough time for Wil Lutz to hit a 50-yard field goal. In a span of just 22 seconds, the divisional playoff game went from a 10-10 tie to the Broncos leading 20-10. There's only been one other instance in the Super Bowl era where a team scored 10 points in the final 30 seconds of the first half and that came in a divisional playoff game between the Cowboys and Packers back in January 1994. In that game, the Cowboys hit a 41-yard field goal with 28 seconds left in the half. The Packers then fumbled away the ensuing kickoff and Troy Aikman made them pay by throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jay Novacek. The 10-point spurt gave the Cowboys a 17-3 lead at halftime in a game they ended up winning 27-17. As for the Bills-Broncos game, Allen has struggled with turnovers. Not only did he fumble at the end of the first half, but he also fumbled on Buffalo's opening drive of the second half. He also threw an interception in the third quarter and if you combine that with a James Cook fumble, the Bills have turned the ball over four times through three quarters. \nFor the latest updates from the game, including the score, be sure to check out our live blog here. \n            \n    ",

No. 1 Arizona beat UCF 84-77, No. 8 Nebraska beat Northwestern 77-58 and Miami (Ohio) barely escaped at home vs. Buffalo, needing overtime to beat the Bulls 105-102.Emphasis on the barely.The RedHawks had to beat the buzzer on a 3-pointer in regulation to force overtime vs. the visiting Bulls, and that wasn't even the biggest shot. They saved their perfect season with one last bit of drama for the finish as Peter Suder walked into a game-winning 3-pointer to end it in the extra period. Suder finished with a career-high 37 points in the win.\nDespite tricky tests, we will exit the weekend with Arizona, Miami (Ohio) and Nebraska remaining unbeaten. But given the upcoming matchups in league play for all three, it seems unlikely they finish the 2025-26 without at least one loss. When those losses come is the real question. Could Arizona or Nebraska run the table in Big 12 and Big Ten play, respectively?! Is it possible Miami (Ohio) enters the postseason 31-0 as it is currently projected to do at KenPom? All of those scenarios are very much in play!But color me skeptical any of those actually happen. Some may call me a curmudgeon but I like to think I'm a realist. And the truth is that in major college basketball, running the table for an entire season -- which has not been done since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers -- is a near-impossibility.Here's when I think those losses will come.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Record: 18-0Next game: Wednesday vs. Cincinnati, 9 p.m. ET (Fox Sports 1)Predicted first loss: Jan. 26 vs. BYUProjected final number of losses: 4\nArizona has largely throttled every team in its path this season and even in close games in which it hasn't had its best stuff -- vs. UCLA, UConn and Arizona State, for instance -- it has managed to remain unscathed. The perfect run ends on Jan. 26, though. On that Monday night road trip, Zona faces BYU -- a team that is 16-1 and a possession away from being undefeated itself -- and the Cougars will be who downs the Wildcats first. There's also several major spots for Arizona to stumble before the postseason. I have road trips to Kansas and Houston as losses as well.

And because they play in the MAC, it also suggests they very much can keep this up. There's a real chance they fall Tuesday with a road game at Kent State, but I'm going to be a true believer here and be bold: I think they make it to Feb. 3 before taking their first loss, becoming the last team in college basketball to remain undefeated.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the seventh straight year, the Buffalo Bills reached the playoffs with Josh Allen, and for the seventh straight year, they didn't make it to the Super Bowl. The Bills are the Sisyphus of the NFL: They roll the boulder up the mountain every year and just as they're about to get to the top, it rolls right back down on them. But this year was supposed to be different. There was no Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs. Allen was the best quarterback in the 14-team postseason field, and if there was any season where he was going to be able to carry his team to the Super Bowl, this felt like the year it was going to happen. Allen put on his Superman cape, only to be stopped by a very unexpected form of Kryptonite: Himself. That's right: Josh Allen was his own worst enemy on Saturday. The Bills star quarterback played like he knew he had the weight of the world on him. Allen was trying to carry a Bills team that didn't have quite as much talent as its had over the past few years, and that weight proved to be too much. Allen turned the ball over four times in a 33-30 overtime loss to Denver and three of those turnovers came because he was trying to make something happen in a situation where he didn't need to do that.\n        \n            \n                Bo Nix injury: Broncos QB suffers season-ending ankle fracture in win over Bills; Jarrett Stidham to start\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's rewind to the end of the first half where Allen made what was easily the most inexcusable mistake of the game and possibly the most inexcusable mistake of his career. With just 16 seconds to go before halftime in a game Buffalo was trailing 17-10, the Bills decided they wanted to try and get some points. That decision turned into a disaster when Allen did this: \nThis was a mistake that was 100% on Allen. He was asking to be stripped on a play that just didn't need to happen. The Bills had no timeouts, so the half was going to end as soon as Allen was tackled. Instead, he fumbled the ball and it was recovered by the Broncos with two seconds left in the half. Denver ended up getting a field goal out of Allen's gaffe. Allen then opened the third quarter with another turnover on Buffalo's opening drive, but it's hard to blame this one on him. Broncos' star pass-rusher Nik Bonitto came in untouched from Allen's blindside and rocked him with a hit that caused a fumble. \nAfter turning the ball over twice, you'd think Allen would have been a little more protective with the football, but that wasn't the case. After the Bills defense picked off Bo Nix in the third quarter, the Buffalo offense was set up with good field position, but Allen threw that away with an interception that came on the second play after Buffalo got the ball back. \nThe Bills had the ball at Denver's 40 and were essentially already in field goal range when Allen's interception happened. After six years of playoff failures, you know that Allen was desperate to get to the AFC title game and it showed in overtime. On a third-and-11 play from his own 36-yard line, Allen went for the jugular and came up empty: He threw another interception. \nIf you watch the play, Cooks had several steps on his defender, but he had to slow up to try and make the catch. If he had come down with the ball, it would have been a spectacular catch, but instead, Ja'Quan McMillian made an even more spectacular interception. \nThere was some controversy involved on this play, because it looked like Brandin Cooks might have caught the ball and been down before Ja'Quan McMillian made the pick, but according to CBS Sports rules expert, Gene Steratore, the officials made the correct call on the field. \"I'm not sure that Cooks has possession coming to the ground,\" Steratore said.  \nAfter getting the interception, the Broncos drove 75 yards down the field for the game-winning field goal. \nWith his four turnovers, Allen became the first quarterback in 10 years to throw at least two interceptions while also losing at least two fumbles in a playoff game. The Broncos ended up getting nine points off of Allen's four turnovers, including the game-winning field goal from Wil Lutz. \"I feel like I let my teammates down tonight,\" an emotional Allen said after the game. \"Just missed opportunities throughout the game. It's been a long season. Hate how it ended. It's gonna stick with me for a long time.\"\nIt wasn't just the turnovers, though. Allen also missed several key throws, including one where he overthrew Dawson Knox on third down with under 20 seconds left to play that likely would have led to a game-winning touchdown. \nLet's be clear, Josh Allen is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. No one is disputing that. He had to deal with several big drops and the Bills wouldn't even have been in this game if not for Allen, who threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns to go along with his four turnovers. But on Saturday, Allen seemed to be playing with the weight of the world on his shoulders and that weight just got too heavy. The divisional round of the playoffs ended with a painful loss for a franchise that knows more about painful playoff losses than any other team in the NFL. For now, the Bills will continue to roll the boulder up the hill, but if it doesn't happen soon for Josh Allen, you certainly start to wonder if it ever will. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a couple days of uncertainty, it is now a done deal. The New York Giants have finalized their contract with former Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh to be their new lead man, the team announced on Saturday night.It was reported on Thursday evening that the Giants had reached an agreement with Harbaugh, but it took almost two full days for the deal to be finalized. According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media, the two sides were debating a \"reporting structure,\" not money. Harbaugh told The Athletic that he will report directly to ownership, but is looking forward to forming a great partnership with general manager Joe Schoen. \"This is the New York Giants,\" Harbaugh told ESPN on Saturday afternoon. \"I'm proud and honored to the head coach of this historic franchise, and especially excited to work with the Mara and Tisch families. But most of all, I can't wait to get started with the great players on this football team to see what we can accomplish together.\"Harbaugh was fired by the Ravens on Jan. 6 following Baltimore's season-ending loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the winningest coach in franchise history, going 180-113 during his 18 seasons, won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 and was named Coach of the Year in 2019.\nWhile Harbaugh won 10 playoff games in his first seven seasons with the Ravens, he won just three postseason matchups over the last 11 years. Harbaugh was reportedly confident he would return to Baltimore to chase a Lombardi Trophy in 2026, but the Ravens made the decision to search for another coach that can get the most out of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. \"We are proud to name John Harbaugh as the next head coach of the New York Giants,\" Giants president John Mara said in a statement. \"Joe Schoen presented us an outstanding group of candidates, which allowed us to be deliberate and confident in this decision. Through numerous conversations, John consistently stood out for his conviction and vision for leading a winning organization, and we welcome him and his family to the Giants.\"When the Ravens made the surprising decision to fire Harbaugh, his agent said he received calls from seven different teams expressing interest in his client 45 minutes after the news broke, per ESPN. There were only six other head coach openings at the time. Harbaugh formally interviewed with the Giants on Wednesday with team owners Mara and Steve Tisch reportedly in attendance, along with quarterback Jaxson Dart, per NFL Media.\nHarbaugh is set to replace Brian Daboll, who went 20-40-1 in his four seasons as lead man. The former Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator went 9-7-1 in his first season back in 2022, won NFL Coach of the Year and upset the Minnesota Vikings in the playoffs. However, the Giants took a step back the next season with a 6-11 record, and went 3-14 in 2024 before Daboll was finally fired 10 games into the 2025 season.Overall, the Giants have struggled ever since Tom Coughlin resigned following the 2015 season. All four full-time head coaches finished with losing records. The Giants have the second-worst record in the NFL (55-109-1) in the 10 seasons since the Coughlin era ended. Only the New York Jets have been worse.Giants' coaches since Tom Coughlin (2016)*denotes interimCoachYearsRecordMike Kafka*20252-5Brian Daboll2022-2520-40-1Joe Judge2020-2110-23Pat Shurmur2018-199-23Steve Spagnuolo*2017*1-3Ben McAdoo2016-1713-15For all of the struggles, the Giants were still considered to be one of the most attractive open jobs this offseason. New York owns the No. 5 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, has a prospective franchise quarterback in Dart, a talented running back with Cam Skattebo, a star wideout in Malik Nabers and then plenty of talent on the defensive line with Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence II and Abdul Carter. Now, they have new hope that comes in the form of an experienced coach that knows how to not only find success, but sustain it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Buffalo Bills suffered another painful playoff loss on Saturday, and to add to the pain, this loss came with some controversy. During Denver's 33-30 overtime win, the Broncos' game-winning drive was set up by an interception that shouldn't have counted, according to Bills coach Sean McDermott. With just under eight minutes left to play in overtime, the Bills were facing a third-and-11 from their own 36-yard line, so Josh Allen decided to throw a deep pass to Brandin Cooks. On the play, Cooks appeared to catch the ball, but after rolling on the ground, it was Ja'Quan McMillian who came up with it. \nIf Cooks was ruled to have control of the ball when his knee hit the ground, then the play would be over, but the officials ruled that Cooks didn't maintain control of the pass as he hit the ground so the ball was still live when McMillian snatched it. After the game, McDermott was asked about the play and he was upset for two reasons. For one, he didn't feel like the officiating crew took enough time to review the play. \n\"It's hard for me to -- and I've had a chance to look at it -- it's hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,\" McDermott said. \"If it is ruled that way, then why wasn't it slowed down just to make sure that we have this right. That would have made a lot of sense to me, to make sure that we have this thing right, because that's a pivotal play in the game. We have the ball at the 20 and we may be kicking a game-winning field goal right there, so I'll just leave it at that.\"An irate McDermott had even more to say after giving his initial answer. \"I'm saying it because I'm standing up for Buffalo, damn it,\" the Bills coach said. \"I'm standing up for us. What went on, that is not how it should go down, in my estimation. These guys spent three hours out there playing football, pouring their guts out. To not even say, 'Hey, let's slow this thing down.' That's where I'm bothered.\"McDermott was then asked if he thought the play should have been ruled a catch and he didn't hide his opinion. \n\"In my eyes, it was, but even if it wasn't, the players are owed, to me, 'Hey let's stop it, let's slow it down, let's put the head referee and give him a chance to look at the monitor,'\" McDermott said. After finishing his press conference, the Bills coach got interviewed again in a pool report and after thinking about the play some more, he was even more adamant that the officials made the wrong call on the field. \"That play is not even close,\" McDermott said, via WGR-550 in Buffalo. \"That's a catch all the way. I sat in my locker and I looked at it probably 20 times, and nobody can convince me that that ball is not caught and in possession of Buffalo. I just have no idea how the NFL handed it, in particular, the way that they did. I think the players and the fans deserve an explanation.\"\nFollowing the game, referee Carl Cheffers gave that explanation when he was asked why the play was ruled an interception. \"The receiver has to complete the process of the catch,\" Cheffers said in the pool report. \"He was going to the ground as part of the process of the catch and he lost possession of the ball when he hit the ground. The defender gained possession of it at that point. The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender is awarded the ball.\"McDermott almost never calls out officials for a possible blown call, but he felt it was necessary in this case. \n\"I'm speaking up because I feel strongly that that was a catch and that possession should have been ball belongs to Buffalo,\" McDermott said. \"I can't agree with their assessment of a change of possession or whatever the statement was. I can't agree with that. We're not just going to sit here and take it, is what I'm saying. We're not just going to sit here and take it. I'm pissed off about it.\"The controversial interception was one of five turnovers by the Bills in the game. Allen was responsible for four of them with two interceptions and two lost fumbles. The pick by McMillian set up even more controversy: The Broncos ended up driving 75 yards for their game-winning field goal, but 47 yards of that total came on pass interference penalties. \nThe Bills have had to do deal with some painful losses in franchise history and this is another one that will certainly be sticking with them for awhile. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There was some doubt about the status of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold for Saturday's divisional round playoff matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. Darnold was listed as questionable after suffering an oblique injury while throwing during Thursday's practice, and ESPN reported Saturday morning that he hasn't thrown a football since. However, Darnold is officially active for the divisional-round showdown. Darnold said he felt some discomfort in his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks by continuing to throw during practice.\"Didn't wanna push it,\" he said Thursday. \"Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.\"Darnold said that there is a \"very low percentage\" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game. \"Probably closer to zero,\" he said with a slight smile. \n\n        \n            \n                Seahawks vs. 49ers prediction: Can San Francisco overcome injuries, short week at No. 1 seed Seattle?\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDarnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Minnesota Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason. Darnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes. \nIf Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn to Drew Lock, who received reps with Seattle's first-team offense on Thursday and Friday. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Denver Broncos. The Seahawks third QB, rookie Jalen Milroe, is inactive for Saturday, expressing further confidence in Darnold being able to go.\"Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,\" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice. \"Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league. Lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.\" \nWhile Lock will have to be ready, Darnold has made it clear that he fully expects to be on the field to make his second career postseason start. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants made a massive move late Wednesday night, as they began working to finalize an agreement with former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh to be their next head coach. It took longer than expected, but the New York Giants have finalized their contract with Harbaugh to be their new lead man, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. NFL Media reports the deal is for five years. Harbaugh was immediately the most sought-after name on the market once he and the Ravens parted ways, and the Giants struck quickly to work on a deal with Harbaugh before he could take reported meetings with the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons this weekend. From the Giants' perspective, this has to be considered an excellent hire -- an \"A,\" if you will.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHarbaugh was extremely successful with the Ravens, compiling a 180-113 regular-season record and making the playoffs 12 times in 18 seasons, going 13-11 in the postseason and winning a Super Bowl back in 2012. A CEO-style head coach who was a former special-teams coordinator, Harbaugh was nevertheless at the forefront of leaguewide trends like aggressive fourth-down decision-making and he showed the ability to adapt with the times and with the construction of his roster, repeatedly seeking out new ideas on both sides of the ball so that he could mold the system around his players rather than try to fit square pegs into round holes. \nHe'll bring immediate stability and competence to a Giants organization that has been desperate for it over at least the last decade, as it has cycled through coach after coach and disappointment after disappointment. He should also be able to bring with him a strong coaching staff, given the connections he has made over the years and the various coaches who have worked with him at one time or another. Reports have already circulated that he'll bring Todd Monken to New York as his offensive coordinator, which would be a very good hire as the Giants look to build their future around Jaxson Dart. Lamar Jackson was already a superstar before Monken got to Baltimore, but he certainly helped take Jackson's game to another level. If he can do the same for Dart, that would be extremely beneficial as the Giants look to improve after being one of the worst teams in the league. We don't yet know who Harbaugh would like to bring with him on the defensive side of the ball, but he's repeatedly found top defensive minds over the years. He's had coaches like Rex Ryan, Vic Fangio, Chuck Pagano, Dean Pees, Teryl Austin, Wink Martindale, Steve Spagnuolo, Mike Macdonald, Leslie Frazier, Jesse Minter, Zach Orr, Anthony Weaver and Dennard Wilson work under him as either coordinators or position coaches at one time or another over the last decade-plus, and the Ravens have routinely had one of the NFL's better defenses. A great deal of that obviously has to do with the talent they have been able to land on that side of the ball, thanks to an excellent front office, but Harbaugh has also brought in a bunch of strong defensive coaches, as mentioned.\nHarbaugh's age (he'll turn 64 early next season) and the Ravens' recent propensity for blowing leads are slight concerns here, but they're mitigated by his long track record of success and the Giants' desperate need for someone who can professionalize the organization. You can, of course, find that type of coach anywhere if you turn over the right stones, but the Giants obviously valued Harbaugh's pedigree highly, and they moved quickly to strike on the man many viewed as the top candidate available this cycle.What others are sayingCBS Sports senior NFL writer Pete Prisco was even more effusive in his praise of the Harbaugh hiring.\"For him, it's an 'A',\" Prisco said. \"It's the best job out there. And I said that when all the jobs opened up. And people say, 'What are you saying?' Well, it's the Giants. The New York Giants. You're in New York. \n\"And not only that, you have a lot of young talent on that team to build around. If you look at the NFL, what do you want? You want a quarterback and you want pass rushers. Well, they have it. If you believe in Jaxson Dart -- and I think he can be successful -- then you have the quarterback and the pass rushers, so it makes sense from that standpoint. So, from his standpoint, it's an A. \"From the Giants' standpoint, A+. You targeted him, you went and got him, and now it's all on you to make sure it works around him. I think this is a no-brainer hire for both sides. If I were John Harbaugh, that's the job I would want. If I were the New York Giants, John Harbaugh's the guy I would want.\"CBS Sports HQ NFL analyst Danny Kanell echoed many of those sentiments. \"I will give it an 'A+',\" Kanell said. \"This was the only coach that would come in and have us talking about this Giants organization as potentially a playoff team. And I don't think it'll only be me. With the young nucleus of talent that the Giants have on this roster, with the track record of success in building a winning culture, with the coordinator that he's most likely going to bring in with him, I think this is a home run hire for the Giants.\"\nYou're not going to find very many people out there who don't think this hiring is one of the better hirings of the cycle, no matter who lands the other available jobs. Harbaugh was sought after for a reason, and the Giants were able to land him before anyone else had a chance. Even if it doesn't work out, the process that led here was likely solid, even if it seemed somewhat predetermined that the Giants would zero in on Harbaugh if he ever became available.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The hot stove has finally begun to heat up. Within the last week Bo Bichette (Mets), Alex Bregman (Cubs), Ranger Suárez (Red Sox), Kyle Tucker (Dodgers), and others signed. Nolan Arenado (Diamondbacks) was finally traded as well. There are still more than a few top free agents available, however. Here now are Saturday's hot stove rumors.  Pressly announces retirement\nLongtime closer Ryan Pressly announced his retirement Saturday. \"The friendships -- from bullpen brothers to vets who mentored me along the way -- those bonds last a lifetime. I'll miss the banter in the 'pen, the inside jokes that kept us loose on those high-leverage nights. But I'm fired up for this next chapter with my family, and chasing whatever adventure comes next,\" he wrote.Pressly, 37, retires with 117 saves and a 3.33 ERA in parts of 13 big league seasons. He spent seven of those seasons with the Astros, where he was a two-time All-Star and the closer on their 2022 World Series team. Pressly is one of the greatest postseason relievers in history, owning 14 saves and a 2.78 ERA in 45 ⅓ career innings in October.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brewers still listening on Peralta\nThe Brewers continue to field offers for ace right-hander Freddy Peralta, according to the New York Post. The Braves, Dodgers, Giants, Mets, and Yankees are among the interested teams. Peralta will make only $8 million in 2026, so he is affordable to every team, though he will be a free agent next offseason. Contenders are the most serious suitors in free agency on the horizon.\nNow 29, Peralta is one of only 11 pitchers to make at least 30 starts in each of the last three seasons. The Brewers have a history of trading their top pitchers one year before free agency (Corbin Burnes, Devin Williams, etc.), though Peralta's bargain salary makes him a viable option for the three-time defending NL Central champion Brewers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Orioles interested in Verlander  \nThe Orioles are among the teams with interest in future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander, reports The Athletic. Verlander and O's president of baseball operations Mike Elias overlapped for several years with the Astros. It's possible Baltimore considers Verlander a fallback plan in case it doesn't land a higher upside arm. We ranked Verlander the 26th best free agent available this offseason.  Verlander, 43 next month, finished last season strong with the Giants, pitching to a 2.60 ERA with strong underlying numbers (3.36 FIP) in his final 13 starts. The O's added Shane Baz and re-signed Zach Eflin earlier this offseason, though there's still room in the rotation for one more quality arm. While no longer the ace he was in his prime, Verlander remains effective.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Reds made De La Cruz record offer\nLast spring, the Reds offered star shortstop Elly De La Cruz the largest contract in franchise history, GM Nick Krall told MLB.com. \"We engaged in spring training of 2025 and presented an offer. The  offer would have been the largest contract in Reds history. We didn't  have any further conversations regarding the offer,\" Krall said. De La Cruz is a Scott Boras client.The largest contract in Reds history is the 10-year, $225 million extension Joey Votto signed in April 2012. The offer to De La Cruz would have easily been the largest contract for a player with between one and two years of service time, eclipsing Jackson Merrill's nine-year, $135 million deal with the Padres. De La Cruz, 24, can not become a free agent until after the 2029 season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     D-backs want to add bullpen arm  The Diamondbacks would like to add a proven late-inning arm, GM Mike Hazen told the Arizona Republic. He acknowledged it will not be easy this late in the offseason though. \"Would I like to have somebody that has a clear pedigree of pitching in  the eighth and ninth inning? That's an easier answer. I'm not sure what  we'll have access to in that way,\" Hazen said.  \nArizona's bullpen ranked 27th in ERA and 28th in WAR in 2025, and its only notable relief adds this offseason are righties Taylor Clarke and Jonathan Loáisiga. Loáisiga is coming off a flexor strain and may not be ready for Opening Day. As it stands, manager Torey Lovullo's late-inning group includes lefty Andrew Saalfrank and righties Kevin Ginkel and Ryan Thompson.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cardinals, Mets interested in Canning  \nCount the Cardinals and Mets among the teams with interest in free agent righty Griffin Canning, according to the New York Post. Canning made 16 mostly effective starts with the Mets last year before blowing out his Achilles taking an awkward step off the mound. He is expected to be ready around Opening Day, or shortly thereafter. Canning was not among our top 50 free agents.  St. Louis is in the early stages of a rebuild and is simply looking to add innings, preferably with upside that could potentially be flipped for prospects at the deadline. Canning qualifies. The Mets need a top flight starter more than another back-end innings guy, though options are limited at this point. Besides, they know Canning well and there's no such thing as too much pitching.  \n            ",

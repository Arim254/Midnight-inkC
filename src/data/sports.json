    "body": "\n        Athletes across multiple sports are getting in the holiday spirit, with many gifting their teammates lavish items. These players drop thousands, sometimes even ten or hundreds of thousands, to show their appreciation of the other players in their locker room.In the NFL, it has been a tradition for quarterbacks to give their offensive linemen gifts as a thank you for protecting them all season. With the holidays upon us, multiple quarterbacks have presented gifts to their teammates.Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes' season may be over due to a torn ACL, but that didn't stop him from going all out for his o-line. He gave them all a Hublot watch, Beats Studio Pro headphones, an indoor golf simulator, Oakley AI sunglasses, a suitcase and an e-bike.The o-line were all smiles receiving the luxury items.\n\nBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen carried over the team motto \"everybody eats\" into his gifts. He gave them all a grill and some meat, specifically a quarter of a cow, to put on the grill.\nThe Detroit Lions offensive linemen were clearly on the \"nice\" list this year. Quarterback Jared Goff had golf carts waiting for his lineman, who were as giddy as little kids on Christmas, testing out their new wheels right away. \nGolf carts were clearly a popular gift this year and Dallas Mavericks' Kyrie Irving got the memo. The team hopped in the carts right away, with some even testing the suspension with some off-roading. Irving told his team they looked great in the custom carts and added that he would ship them to each of their homes.The team then drove the carts around town, telling people to come to their games.\nLos Angeles Lakers' Luka Doncic set his squad up with e-bikes. He not only bought his teammates the bikes, but purchased over 100 total for the staff as well. \n\n\nWNBA star Caitlin Clark gave shoes to the Butler men's basketball team, where her boyfriend, Connor McCaffrey, is an assistant coach.\n            ",

The Mavs have won four consecutive home games straight-up, and covered a 6.5-point underdog spread in each of their last nine home contests. Both the Mavericks and Nuggets are playing the second half of a back-to-back, so fatigue could be a factor, which could hinder the usage and production of Denver veterans such as Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. Cooper Flagg had 16 points, six rebounds and six assists on Monday, and he's averaging 24.3 points per game over his last 10 contests, playing like a true No. 1 overall pick. The model projects Dallas to have another strong home showing, with the Mavericks covering in 57% of simulations. Back the Mavericks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:UNLV vs. Ohio: Under 66.5 total pointsUNLV has one of the better scoring offenses in the nation, ranking 14th in the country at 35.8 ppg this season. However, Ohio has held opponents to 21 points or fewer in seven of its last eight games, and it also had some impressive non-conference showings in holding West Virginia to 10 points and Ohio State to 37 points. The Buckeyes scored more than 37 points in four of nine games in Big Ten play, which makes the fact that the MAC defense held them to that total even more impressive. UNLV's higher-ranked scoring offense often inflates its over/under total, which has resulted in the Under hitting in four of its last five games. The Under has also hit in three of the last five Ohio games, as the model projects the Under to hit in 69% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Trail Blazers (+105) to defeat the MagicPortland had its three-game winning streak snapped in a 110-102 loss to the Pistons on Monday, but Detroit has the second-best record in the NBA at 23-6 this season. Meanwhile, the Magic were mostly non-competitive in their 120-97 loss to the Warriors on Monday, dropping the third of their last four contests. The Magic are also dealing with multiple injuries, which has contribured to their recent skid. Meanwhile, Blazers forward Deni Avdija is averaging 25.5 points, 7.1 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, making significant improvements in his fifth NBA season, and Portland is 2-1 over its last three home games.

    "body": "\nA division crown seemed like nothing but a dream for the Carolina Panthers after their disappointing start to the 2025 NFL season. With two games remaining on the schedule, the team has its NFC South title fate in its own hands.Carolina (8-7) was demolished 42-13 by the New England Patriots in Week 4 to fall to 1-3, and an eighth consecutive sub-.500 campaign was expected by most. But the Panthers defied the cynics in Dave Canales' second year as head coach and went on to win six of their next nine contests to thrust themselves right into the NFC South race.Their prospects were aided by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' downward spiral. In line for a fifth consecutive division title after a 6-2 start, Tampa Bay (7-8) floundered after returning from its bye, losing three straight before edging the Arizona Cardinals 20-17 in Week 13 to maintain a one-half game lead over Carolina.The Panthers had their bye the ensuing week and dropped a 20-17 decision to New Orleans upon their return, while the Buccaneers followed their victory with setbacks against New Orleans and the Atlanta Falcons, setting up a showdown between the 7-7 rivals in Charlotte in Week 16.The contest was a back-and-forth affair as the lead changed hands four times before Tampa Bay forged a 20-20 tie with a field goal early in the fourth quarter. But Carolina converted one of its own with 2:20 remaining and intercepted Baker Mayfield in Panthers territory with 49 seconds left to seal a 23-20 triumph and take sole possession of first place in the division.As a result, the Panthers could have their sixth NFC South title and first since 2015 in their pocket by late Sunday afternoon and make their rematch with the Buccaneers in the regular-season finale insignificant. It will be anything but easy, however, as Carolina hosts the conference-leading Seattle Seahawks (12-3), while Tampa Bay visits the downtrodden Miami Dolphins (6-9).\nShould the Panthers upset the Seahawks and the Buccaneers end their matchup against the Dolphins with either a tie or their seventh loss in eight games, Carolina will clinch an unforeseen division crown after secure its first winning record since going 11-5 in 2017. A tie by the Panthers, who entered this year with a total of seven victories over their previous two seasons, and loss by Tampa Bay also would put a bow on the NFC South.However, Seattle enters Week 17 with a winning streak that reached five games with a stunning 38-37 overtime triumph over the Los Angeles Rams last Thursday and the NFC West title in its sights. In addition, Carolina has won back-to-back games just once this season and hasn't accomplished the feat since posting three consecutive victories from Weeks 5-7.A meltdown such as the one Tampa Bay is experiencing could wind up costing head coach Todd Bowles his job should the team miss the postseason, regardless of the fact he had guided the Bucs to the division title in each of his first three years at the helm. But since the Dolphins have suffered double-digit losses in each of their last two outings after a four-game winning streak gave them false hope for a postseason berth, it's reasonable to think the Buccaneers will right the ship and defeat a rudderless Miami team that saw head coach Mike McDaniel, who likely will be fired at the end of the season, bench No. 1 quarterback Tua Tagovailoa prior to last week's 45-21 setback against the Cincinnati Bengals.\nConsidering the state of each club after Carolina's triumph last week, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and its projection model currently give the Panthers the best chance to win the NFC South. But the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, believes Carolina and Tampa Bay's prospects are close to equal should both finish with the same result on Sunday.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC SOUTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 17 WINWITH WEEK 17 LOSSDIFFERENCECarolina Panthers53.5%62.6%32.5%30.1%Tampa Bay Buccaneers46.5%66.5%33.6%32.9%The Panthers are just 4-9 against the Seahawks in regular-season play and have lost four of their last five meetings, including a 37-27 defeat at Seattle in 2023 in which Kenneth Walker III ran for 97 yards and a pair of touchdowns for the home team. Carolina's defense will have to contend with a Seahawks squad that is third in the NFL in scoring (29.5 points) and sixth in passing offense (238.1 yards), thanks in large part to Sam Darnold, who ranks fifth in the league with 3,703 passing yards, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who leads all players with 1,637 receiving yards.Tampa Bay has won three straight and six of its last seven matchups against Miami after having lost four of the first five games in the all-time series. The Buccaneers' most recent victory over the Dolphins took place in 2021, when Mike Evans made six catches for 113 yards and hauled in two of the legendary Tom Brady's five touchdown passes in a 45-17 thrashing. Seattle is a 7-point favorite against Carolina in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings, and the model is predicting a 27-20 victory for the Seahawks. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites at the sportsbook in their matchup versus the Dolphins, with the ITL team's model calling for a 28-25 triumph by Tampa Bay. Those outcomes would set up a showdown between the Panthers and Bucs in Tampa for the NFC South title in Week 18, which is something no one could have seen coming when the season began.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson remembers his last trip to the Rose Bowl with the Crimson Tide fondly. Two years ago, a few days prior to Alabama's loss to Michigan in the College Football Playoff semifinal, Simpson recalls meeting with then-coach Nick Saban about his plan for the rest of his career following two seasons as a backup.Simpson was eyeing a potential jump to the transfer portal before Saban changed his mind the only way he knew how.\"He said, 'I get it if you want to leave, but I know you, and I know what you wanted in recruiting. If you want to create value for yourself and you want to be a first-round draft pick, this could be a great story for you. You could leave a legacy here,'\" Simpson said, referring to Saban, on the 'Bussin' With The Boys' podcast this week. \"I thought about it, prayed about it, and said, you know what? You're right. And the next thing you know, he retires. I'm sitting there, and I'm like, he just lied to me\"But also as a coach's son, I understand. I understand what was going on. I understand how he thought about it. We had a good conversation about it, and to this day, we laugh about it.\"\nSaban announced his retirement from Alabama 10 days after the Crimson Tide's loss to the eventual-national champion Wolverines, but Simpson skipped an opportunity to leave to stay with the team.Crowned the starter this season as a fourth-year junior in Kalen DeBoer's second year, Simpson has thrown for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns entering next week's showdown with unbeaten and top-ranked Indiana.Simpson's first spring with DeBoer in 2024 was reassuring that he made the right decision to stick around following Saban's retirement. \n\"Just got to play ball. It was free. It was offensive-minded and not defensive-minded,\" Simpson said during the podcast episode published Tuesday. \"Honestly, it probably was better for my development in a sort of way, just because it wasn't -- honestly, because I could just play. The only reps that I got was some in a game, some in the South Florida game, but it was all defensive-minded reps. I had to prove to myself that I could actually play. I knew I could do it, whether it was in high school or practice, or during a game or a live-action scrimmage, I needed to prove to myself that I could.\"Coach DeBoer, that's all we did during the spring. 'Y'all just go play man. Just go do you.' Honestly, I took a huge step.\"Simpson's \"steps\" thereafter have led to first-round buzz for the 2026 NFL Draft as one of the nation's top prospects under center. And according to DraftKings Sportsbook's latest odds, Simpson is at +1800 to go No. 1 overall.\nEarlier this season, Simpson said he met with Saban before Alabama's opener to help ease some of the anxiety brought with the pressure of being the Crimson Tide's QB1. And after losing the game at Florida State, Simpson led Alabama to wins in 10 of its next 12 games prior to the SEC Championship loss to Georgia and a last weekend's first-round playoff victory at Oklahoma.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Washington Wizards announced that forward Cam Whitmore will be out indefinitely after being diagnosed with deep-vein thrombosis. Whitmore had missed the last six games, and the last two was specifically due to right shoulder soreness, and after further evaluation it was determined that he had DVT.DVT can cause blood clots in the veins of the arms or legs, and has become more commonplace for NBA players to be dealing with it. Last season, Damian Lillard missed time after a blood clot was discovered in his calf. Similarly, Victor Wembanyama's season was cut short last season due to a blood clot in his right shoulder from DVT. He missed the last 29 games of the season.It's an unfortunate blow for Whitmore, who was averaging 10.4 points on 47% from the floor in the last 11 games. While a timeline for his return is unknown, there is precedent for players returning with no issues after being diagnosed with DVT. Wembanyama is a great example of that. Detroit Pistons forward Ausar Thompson, missed the last month of his rookie season and the first month of last season with DVT, but has had no issues this season while averaging a career high on the East leading Pistons.Treating DVT is dependent on the location of the blood clot, but ensuring it's taken care of is crucial. If untreated, the blood clot can potentially travel to the lungs and cause pulmonary embolism, which can be life threatening.\nGiven the timeline of previous players who have dealt with this, Whitmore may miss a significant amount of time while this is taken care of. It's a tough situation for Whitmore in his first season with the Wizards after being traded by the Rockets this past summer. For the Wizards, they lose some wing depth in their rotation, though given they have the worst record in the league at 5-22, the focus is surely more on Whitmore's long-term health than any wins and losses that occur this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier continues to step up his legal defense in advance of a potential trial in the federal sports betting case. Just over two weeks after he entered a not guilty plea, Rozier now seeks to have his charges dismissed altogether.Rozier was arraigned on two charges -- conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering -- but his attorney, Jim Trusty, argues that the federal government overstepped with those allegations. Trusty said the government did not clearly explain how Rozier allegedly committed wire fraud in the indictment and, in turn, filed a motion to dismiss.Trusty cited a 2023 United States Supreme Court ruling that outlines the basis of a wire fraud charge. That is, the purpose of the scheme must be to deprive a victim (in this case, the sportsbooks) of money or property. The money laundering charge depends on the wire fraud charge and would thus crumble if the latter is dismissed.\"The government has billed this case as involving 'insider betting' and 'rigging' professional basketball games,\" Trusty said in a public legal document. \"But the indictment alleges something less headline-worthy: that some bettors broke certain sportsbooks' terms of use.\"\nRozier was implicated in the case for his alleged involvement in a gambling ring that involved the trading of inside, non-public information to bettors. Rozier is accused of informing a co-conspirator, De'Niro Laster, that he would remove himself early from a March 2023 game during his tenure with the Charlotte Hornets. Laster then sold that information to gamblers, who then distributed it through a betting syndicate, according to the indictment.\"The indictment does not allege that Mr. Rozier ever placed a bet, whether himself or through a proxy, on any NBA game,\" Trusty said. \"Nor does it allege that he knew that Laster intended to sell this information to others, or that using it to place wagers would violate the Betting Companies' rules.\"The prosecution must respond by Feb. 2. The next procedural hearing for the more than 30 defendants in the gambling case is set for March 4, and Judge Ramon Reyes said at a previous hearing that he intends for a trial to begin by September.\nRozier was arrested in October along with suspended Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, former NBA player Damon Jones and more than 30 others. Billups is accused of participating in a separate gambling scheme tied to rigged poker games run by organized crime. Jones is implicated in both cases. Both pleaded not guilty to their charges.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last time former No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons suited up for an NBA game, he played under five minutes for the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 5 of their first-round playoff exit to the Denver Nuggets last season. He recorded zero points while recording one rebound and one block. It ended a season where Simmons played just 18 games for L.A. after being waived by the Brooklyn Nets in February, and signing a deal for the remainder of the season with the Clippers.He went unsigned as a free agent during the offseason, and while he's still working on an NBA comeback, the three-time All Star's focus has been on professional fishing as of late. Simmons told Andscape that he's been completing two-a-day basketball and strength and rehabilitation workouts six days a week, with hopes of making his return to the NBA. While there's no firm timeline for his return, and with no team there's certainly no expectations placed on him, the two-time All-Defensive player hopes to be healthy enough to join a team during the All-Star break, or perhaps next season. But he doesn't want to just be on a roster for the sake of it.\"I don't believe it's just [about] getting on a team,\" Simmons said. \"So, if I were to play right now, I think I'd fit right into the NBA just given what I can do. But I want to give everything I can to the game. I don't think there's any point in just wasting a spot just to be out there. I think that's a little selfish. And there are guys that do it now. But that's what it is, the business.\"In conjunction with workouts that Simmons says are \"exhausting,\" he's become an owner of a professional fishing team, the South Florida Sails. It's part of the Sport Fishing Championship league, which consists of 16 teams across 11 states. They compete in tournaments catching various fish, with a championship on the line at the end of a season.\n\"It's a very niche sport. And if you don't know, you don't know,\" Simmons said. \"But once you experience it and get out there and see what it's about, you're kind of in awe of what the sport is. And that's just something I've always been interested in in terms of the sport of fishing. The technique. And there's so much to it that people just don't understand. These guys are fishing on million-dollar vessels, and they're out for days at a time. So, it's tedious and gritty, but a lot of fun. It's one of those worlds where you just got to kind of experience it, get into it and see what it's about.\"Simmons isn't a member on the team, as he said he's \"not the best angler,\" but he's been incredibly committed to being involved from an ownership standpoint.\"I have a passion in helping these guys grow the sport because I really believe in it. So, for me to compete, it would be a little selfish. Maybe if I work hard enough to be a bit of an angler, maybe I'll put myself on the roster. But it's more so for me about building the community in Miami around the fishing. That's really important, and it's a responsibility that we have now.\"\nAs far as his NBA return goes, Simmons said he hasn't suffered any setbacks as he tries to rejoin the league. As encouraging as that is, Simmons hasn't played 60 or more games since his second season in the league -- which is pre-pandemic. He played 51 games last season split between the Nets and Clippers, but was still far away from the two-way floor general that earned him several accolades early in his career.In reality, Simmons might not ever return to that version of himself who was locking down the league's best offensive players on one end and dishing out some eyebrow-raising dimes on the other. But he still wants to try.\"We're human, we want to find out,\" Simmons said. \"I got to see. I don't think this story is over for me playing, but let's see where it goes. So as long as I put in that work and put the energy into doing that, then everything else will write itself.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt wasn't long ago that the Los Angeles Rams repeating as NFC West champions seemed like a lock. But as the 2025 NFL season has proven time and again, situations can change in an instant.The Rams were rolling at 9-2 but squandered a fourth-quarter lead against the Carolina Panthers in Week 13 and dropped a 31-28 decision, ending their six-game winning streak. The Seattle Seahawks routed the Minnesota Vikings 26-0 that day to pull even with Los Angeles atop the division and both clubs won their next two contests, setting up a huge showdown in Week 16.Having already beaten the Seahawks at home in Week 11, the Rams could have taken a major step toward securing their 16th NFC West title by sweeping the season series. However, they let a 16-point lead with just over eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter slip away and were unable to stop Seattle after beginning overtime with a touchdown, allowing the Seahawks to post a 38-37 victory and climb into the driver's seat in the division.Los Angeles (11-4) still can capture the NFC West crown -- and even the No. 1 seed in the conference -- but it first will need help this Sunday from either the Panthers or Chicago Bears -- or both. Carolina hosts Seattle (12-3) and Chicago visits the San Francisco 49ers (11-4), who own the tiebreaker with the Rams. If the Seahawks and 49ers both win their Week 17 matchups, it would render Los Angeles' meeting with the Atlanta Falcons (6-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Monday Night Football meaningless when it comes to the division title.\nHowever, the door would remain open for Los Angeles with a loss by at least one of its division rivals. The Rams then would need to defeat Atlanta -- as well as the Arizona Cardinals in their regular-season finale -- and have whichever team won in Week 17 lose in the Week 18 showdown between Seattle and San Francisco.It may seem like a tall order, but the Seahawks are on the road Sunday against a Carolina team that is battling the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the NFC South title and the 49ers host a Chicago squad that may require a victory to clinch the NFC North and also is in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference. With much at stake for both the Panthers and Bears, winning in Week 17 will be anything but an easy task for Seattle and San Francisco.On the other hand, while a win is never a given in the NFL, the Rams have a much easier job ahead of them. Atlanta has posted back-to-back victories after losing seven of its previous eight games, but one of those triumphs came against Arizona last week. That defeat was the seventh in a row and 12th in 13 contests for the Cardinals, who got off to a promising 2-0 start this season.Even if the Rams receive the help they need on Sunday, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes their outlook for a second straight NFC West title wouldn't improve a great deal with a victory on Monday Night Football. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, Los Angeles currently has about a 22% chance to win the division, and it would only improve by around 10% with a triumph over Atlanta.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 17 WINWITH WEEK 17 LOSSDIFFERENCELos Angeles Rams22.1%32.4%0.0%32.4%Seattle Seahawks49.0%63.6%24.3%39.3%San Francisco 49ers28.9%44.9%7.0%37.9%The model also believes that the team that finishes first in the NFC West will be the top-seeded playoff team in the conference as well. CHANCES TO BE NO. 1 SEED IN NFCTEAMCURRENT ODDSSeattle Seahawks44.7%San Francisco 49ers25.1%Los Angeles Rams18.7%Chicago Bears11.3%Philadelphia Eagles0.1%The Rams pose a major problem for opposing defenses as they top the NFL in both total offense (396.7 yards) and scoring (30.5 points), rank second in passing (270.5 yards) and are fifth in rushing (126.3). They possess an aerial attack that is led by Matthew Stafford, who leads the league with 4,179 passing yards and 40 touchdown tosses, and includes wide receivers Davante Adams (first with 14 TD catches) and Puka Nacua (second with 1,592 receiving yards).Containing that trio is a tall order for any defense, even an Atlanta unit that is eighth in the NFL against the pass (195.1 yards allowed). The Rams own a 49-28-2 all-time record against the Falcons in the regular season and won the last two meetings between the teams, including a 31-27 home triumph in 2022 in which Stafford threw for 272 yards and three touchdowns.Los Angeles, which still has the No. 5 seed in the conference for which to play should the NFC West title and top seed be out of the question, is a 7.5-point favorite against Atlanta in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings. The ITL team's model is predicting a 30-21 victory by the Rams, which would keep them alive in the race for the division crown should Seattle and/or San Francisco lose in Week 17.\n            ",

    "body": "\nChristmas Day is nearly here, which means presents, quality time with the family and, this year, a three-game NFL slate featuring some iconic rivalry clashes to kick off Week 17. The action begins at 1 p.m. ET with the Cowboys visiting the Commanders, which is followed by the Lions at Vikings at 4:30 p.m. ET before the day concludes with Broncos vs. Chiefs at 8:15 p.m. ET. The first two games will air exclusively on Netflix, while the AFC West clash airs on Prime Video for Thursday Night Football. Here, we preview all three games, share NFL betting lines and odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook and more.Cowboys vs. Commanders (1 p.m. ET)\nThe Cowboys had an ever-so-slight chance at still sneaking into the postseason entering Week 16, but those hopes quickly ended with the Eagles' victory over these Commanders on Saturday. Dallas instead will watch the playoffs from home this year despite having arguably the best offense in the NFL. The Commanders will also be watching games from the couch, which is a major disappointment after a run to the NFC Championship Game last season. Washington was dealt a bad case of the injury bug, namely to quarterback Jayden Daniels and star receiver Terry McLaurin, while the defense was 31st in yards allowed and 27th in points allowed. These teams last met back in October, which resulted in a dominant 44-22 Cowboys win with Dak Prescott tossing three touchdowns and Javonte Williams rushing for 116 yards and a score. This matchup will see the Cowboys at relative full strength, but the Commanders will be without Daniels as the second-year quarterback was shut down for the remainder of the season. Marcus Mariota, who has played quite a bit with Daniels banged up this season, will once again start for Washington. The Cowboys are favored at -7 on the road, while the total is among the highest of the week at 50.5, which should come as no surprise given these teams have struggled mightily on defense this season. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, expects Washington to keep this one close, as it has the Commanders covering in 60% of simulations. Dallas is 7-8 against the spread this year while Washington is 5-10 ATS. Cowboys games usually go Over the total, as that's occurred 11 times in 15 contests. Washington is 8-7 to the Over. New users can bet the spread with the DraftKings promo code to receive $200 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:\nLions vs. Vikings (4:30 p.m. ET)\nThese were the two top teams in the NFC North a year ago, but things have changed a good bit in this division. The Lions have gone from the No. 1 seed in the conference at 15-2 to 8-7 and in serious danger of missing the playoffs altogether this year. Detroit is on the outside looking in right now and needs to win out and have the Packers lose each of the final two weeks of the year. One more Lions loss or one more Packers win eliminates Detroit from postseason contention. As for the Vikings, it's been a tough year after 2024's 14-3 campaign, with Minnesota largely struggling in its adjustment to J.J. McCarthy under center. He's played better of late against some poor defenses, but the Vikings will enter 2026 needing a major step forward from its quarterback.One bright spot for McCarthy this year was leading the Vikings to an upset win over the Lions in Detroit on Nov. 2. The Vikings won that one 27-24, with McCarthy tossing two touchdown passes and rushing for another score. The Lions outgained the Vikings 305-258 but struggled mightily in the run game and lost a fumble. Detroit is a 6-point favorite for Week 17 at DraftKings, and the total sits at 44.5. The SportsLine model has the Lions winning in the majority of simulations and covering the spread 53% of the time. The Lions are 7-8 against the spread in 2025, as are the Vikings. Lions games have gone Over the total 10 times in 15 games this season, while the Vikings are 8-7 to the Over.\nBroncos vs. Chiefs (8:15 p.m. ET)\nThe Chiefs' reign atop the AFC West is over. Kansas City had won the division nine years in a row, but the Chiefs won't even make the postseason this year. Instead, the Broncos enter Week 17 at 12-3 to sit in both first place in the division and atop the AFC standings as the current No. 1 seed. Denver is looking to secure homefield advantage over these final two weeks, while three teams are right behind at 11-4, including the Chargers, who face the Broncos next week in a game that may very well decide both the AFC West and the race for the top seed in the conference. The Broncos took down the Chiefs 22-19 on Nov. 16, but that was a very different Kansas City team. Those Chiefs still had something to play for, and they also still had Patrick Mahomes under center. The star quarterback tore his ACL two weeks ago in a loss to the Chargers, and his backup, Gardner Minshew, then tore his ACL in a Week 16 blowout loss to the Titans. The frontrunner to start this week is Chris Oladokun, a former seventh-round pick who saw his first taste of NFL action last week. Assuming Oladokun gets the nod, his first NFL start would come against the No. 5-ranked scoring defense in the NFL. Denver is favored by 13.5 points, while the total sits at just 36.5. The SportsLine model does think the Chiefs will cover here, though, as that occurs in nearly 60% of model simulations. Neither team has impressed against the spread this season, with Denver 6-9 ATS and Kansas City 5-10. The Chiefs are 4-11 to the Over while Denver is 7-8. Bet the spread at DraftKings and receive $200 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:\n            ",

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

McCarthy for their Christmas matchup against the Detroit Lions, as the second-year quarterback suffered a \"very, very small hairline fracture\" on his right throwing hand, coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters on Tuesday.Max Brosmer will make his second career start on Thursday in place of McCarthy. His first NFL start came in Week 13, where the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0. Brosmer threw for 126 yards and four interceptions in that matchup.Despite the late-season injury, the Vikings are not placing McCarthy on injured reserve. He missed the second half of Sunday's 16-13 victory against the New York Giants with the hand injury, and completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and one interception.It's another unfortunate development for McCarthy, who has already missed 23 of 32 career games due to various injuries. The former No. 10 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft missed his entire rookie season due to a torn mensicus, and has missed six starts this year due to a high ankle sprain, and then a concussion. In nine starts this season, McCarthy has accounted for 15 touchdowns and 14 turnovers. \nThe 7-8 Vikings are in last place in the NFC North, and have already been eliminated from playoff contention. Minnesota upset the Lions in Detroit earlier this season in Week 9. McCarthy threw for 143 yards and scored three total touchdowns in that matchup.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        During the festive period, games coming left and right can lead to an injury pile-up, and that's just what the U.S. men's national team are experiencing without even participating in the games. American defender Chris Richards had to leave the EFL Cup quarterfinal with an injury as Crystal Palace drew 1-1 with Arsenal before being knocked out 8-7 in the penalty shootout that would follow. This comes after captain Tyler Adams tore his MCL and will be out for 2-3 months.Richards went down in the 73rd minute and had to be stretchered off for Palace before Arsenal forced an own goal via a shot from close range from Jurrien Timber as Maxence Lacroix scored what would seem like the game's only goal before another Palace center back got in on the action.\nDespite the result, all eyes will be on Richards. Coach Oliver Glasner said that Richards needed stitches on his foot, said he hopes it isn't too bad but did say he's not ruling him out for playing on New Year's Day. A key player for the Eagles as well as the United States men's national team, there is also the slight quirk of Richards being projected as a starter for the USMNT in a World Cup on home soil in 2026, and his place in the team is pivotal. A player who has captained the side at times under Mauricio Pochettino, Richards will be a critical part of the USMNT setup in an uncertain defensive pairing. Tim Ream has been starting next to Richards, but the Charlotte FC defender is 38, and if Pochettino opts for a back three, questions surround who would partner the duo during the World Cup.\nNow all eyes will be on the official severity of Richard's injury, though Glasner did not appeared too concerned, which is welcomed by the USMNT faithful. While the UMSNT won't play a game until March when they host Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta, Palace are right back at it hosting Tottenham on Dec. 28 and Fulham three days later on Jan. 1. With fourth through 10th in the Premier League only separated by five points, any time missed will push what manager Glasner is able to accomplish possibly jeopardizing what has been an excellent season so far. Richards is someone who will be needed with Palace still going in the FA Cup and the Europa Conference League while pushing for a top-four spot in the Premier League.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nWe're getting into the part of every season where we have to worry about motivation, and not just for teams out of the playoff race. Teams like the Eagles and potentially Steelers (if the Ravens lose on Saturday) will have to determine if they want to chase a slightly better seed or limit the risk of injury to key players over the final two weeks.The potential rest angle for certain teams allows us to play a few correlated parlays at this time of year. If the Ravens lose on Saturday, the Browns will certainly have a much better chance of beating the Steelers on Sunday, as starters could rest for some or all of the game. Throwing the Packers and Browns in a money line parlay should get you anywhere from +350 to +400, but you can also add the Bills for an additional potential rest angle.\nAnother potential correlated money line parlay involves the three NFC West teams, all of whom clinched a playoff berth in Week 16. The Rams' loss to the Seahawks could wind up being catastrophic as they may not even have a chance to play for a division title by Monday. If the favored Seahawks and 49ers both win their matchups, they'll be squaring off for the No. 1 seed in Week 18 and the Rams will have to consider resting starters for some or all of their game against the Falcons. Sean McVay has shown a preference for resting players in the past.Putting the Seahawks, 49ers and Falcons together in a money line parlay should get you even better odds than our previous parlay considering the Falcons are a massive underdog early in the week.\nI'll have several spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and highlight a few more teams of note.Week 17 power ratingsTeam1716151413LAR88767.5SEA6.566.566NE54443.5BUF54.54.54.54.5JAC53210SF4.53211PHI4.53244.5DEN44.52.51.52LAC41.5100HOU3.53.531.51DET33.54.53.55CHI2.51.5121GB1.5354.54PIT1.510-1.5-1.5BAL01.512.54TB0000-3CAR-1-2.5-2-2.5-4.5DAL-1.5022.51CIN-2-2.500-1.5ATL-3-3.5-3.5-3-3IND-3.5-4.5-52.55MIN-4.5-1-3-6-3NO-4.5-4.5-4.5-7-6.5TEN-5.5-8-8.5-9-8.5CLE-6-7.5-4.5-6-5.5ARI-6.5-4.5-3.5-2.5-3KC-7.5-2.52.556.5WAS-8-4.5-4.5-2.5-5.5NYG-8-5-3.5-4-2.5MIA-8.5-2.5-2-3.5-4LV-9-10-7-7-6NYJ-10   -9-8.5-7.5-7.5I'm still giving the Rams a clear edge over the Seahawks despite last week's result, which required an improbable fourth-quarter rally by Seattle just to send the game into overtime. The Rams might be on the road the entire playoffs and still wind up favored in every game.I have the Bills, Patriots and Jaguars grouped together in my second tier. Buffalo appears to have the weakest roster of the three overall, but the Bills also have the great equalizer at quarterback, and Josh Allen might run through the AFC playoffs winning games 41-38 if he has to. The Jaguars have done enough to be right alongside the best teams in the AFC after their dismantling of the Broncos, a team I finally started to believe in heading into last week. The Patriots may be getting a little bit of the benefit of the doubt, but they played well enough in their two games against Buffalo that I didn't want to have them slotted lower than the Bills.Next up comes the 49ers and Eagles, two teams that are getting healthier down the stretch and might be able to play up to their full potential in January. San Francisco is much like Buffalo with questions about the defense but an offense that is going to be hard to beat in a shootout, but I have enough confidence in the defense to make plays that I want to have them as clearly higher than the Lions, a team with a similar profile.The Broncos and Chargers slot in next, and I'm going to have a hard time not taking the Chargers in Week 18 with how hit or miss the Broncos have been this year. I'd play both over Houston, a much more hit-and-miss team that is hard to trust after an embarrassing effort against the Raiders.You could argue the Bears should be much higher than where I have them, behind a Lions team that is probably going to miss the playoffs, but they were down 10 at home with two minutes left to a team that lost its QB midgame. Kudos for pulling out the win, but with a point differential that sits 15th between the Chiefs and Steelers -- and I'm already putting Chicago ahead of Pittsburgh -- I don't know that I'm comfortable moving them much higher. That would certainly change if they can beat the 49ers in San Francisco.The ratings for the Ravens and Packers are up in the air with uncertainty around their QB situation, and I'm still putting the Bucs slightly ahead of the Panthers despite Carolina's win.Full Week 18 projected linesAwayHomeLookaheadConsensusPR SpreadNotesDALWAS+3.5+7+5Johnson expected for WASDETMIN+3.5+7+5.5Brosmer to start for MINDENKC+5.5+12.5+9.5Oladokun to start for KCHOULAC+1.5-2.5-1.5BALGB-3-2.5-3.5QB situation on both sides is fluidJACIND+5.5+6.5+7SEACAR+7.5+7.5+6ARICIN-5.5-7-6PITCLE+4.5+3.5+5PIT could rest players if BAL losesNOTEN+2+2.5-1NENYJ+9.5+13.5+12.5TBMIA+2.5+5.5+5.5NYGLV+3-1.5-0.5PHIBUF-3-1.5-3.5PHI could rest playersCHISF-2.5-3-4.5LAR   ATL   +8.5   +8+8   LAR could rest players if SEA, SF winThis is how I would set each game based on my power ratings and home-field advantage data for this week.

    "body": "\nHere are two mind-blowing facts: Denver Nuggets big man and three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic is on pace to become the first player in league history to lead the NBA in assists per game (10.8) and rebounds per game (12.1) while averaging 28.9 points per game (seventh in the NBA) and shooting a robust 60.7% from the field (eighth).And yet, despite a Chamberlain-like start to the season, Jokic is not the favorite in this season's NBA MVP race. He ranks second in DraftKings' MVP odds, at +180 behind last season's winner Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (+110), who's having an equally remarkable season for the 26-3 Thunder.The Jokic triple-double show hits Dallas on Tuesday night when he and the Nuggets square off against Cooper Flagg and the Mavericks at the American Airlines Center. Denver (21-7) is playing the second half of a back-to-back, one night after blowing out the Jazz, 135-112. Dallas (11-19) also will be playing for the second straight night. On Monday, the Mavericks lost 119-113 to the Pelicans in New Orleans.The Nuggets are 6.5-point favorites over Dallas on Tuesday.While Nuggets-Mavericks is the marquee attraction on Tuesday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes 14 NBA games and three college football bowl games. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Tuesday, Dec. 23. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watchNuggets at MavericksTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Dallas | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Mavericks +216\nIf Anthony Davis isn't careful, he may make himself too pricey for a trade out of Dallas. Davis, who was the key return in last season's deal that sent Luka Doncic to Los Angeles, has been playing well for the struggling Mavericks (11-19) despite widespread speculation that the front office will ship him out before the trade deadline. In Monday's loss to the Pelicans, he set season highs in points (35) and rebounds (17) while making 16 of his 28 shots from the field. When Dallas and Denver met earlier this month, Davis had 32 points and 13 rebounds in a 131-121 Mavericks victory. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NBA game 10,000 times, says Dallas wins 40% of the time and assigns a \"B\" grade to Mavericks money line (+216).Rockets at ClippersTime: 10:30 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Clippers +7.5\nDespite the Rockets getting a ton of buzz as a threat to the Thunder's reign in the Western Conference, Houston sure has had a problem closing out games recently. The Rockets (17-9) are 1-3 in their last four games, with all three losses coming in overtime. That includes blowing a 25-point lead against the Pelicans on Thursday and a five-point lead with less than a minute left against the Kings on Sunday. The Clippers (7-21) have struggled mightily this season but less than two weeks ago they narrowly lost at Houston 115-113. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59% chance Los Angeles covers and gives a \"B\" grade to Clippers +7.5.College football best bets, where to watchNew Orleans Bowl: Western Kentucky vs. Southern MissTime: 5:30 p.m. | Location: New Orleans | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Western Kentucky -101 | Expert: Western Kentucky -1 (Mike Tierney)\nCharles Huff has left the Southern Miss Golden Eagles after only one season to take the head job at Memphis, but in his lone season he turned the program around from a 1-11 year to a 7-5 campaign. The Golden Eagles have won the turnover battle all year; they have forced 26 turnovers, which is tied for fourth in the country. They also are tied for sixth in the nation in turnover margin (1.00 per game). Forcing turnovers will help against a Western Kentucky team that leads Conference USA in scoring (29.8 points per game). Tierney notes Hilltoppers coach Tyson Helton is 4-2 in bowl games. Also, C-USA is 3-0 outright against the Sun Belt in bowls this month. The SportsLine Projection Model gives Western Kentucky a 66% chance to win and assigns a strong \"A\" grade to Hilltoppers money line (-101).Frisco Bowl: UNLV vs. OhioTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Frisco, Texas | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 62.5 | Expert: Ohio +7 (Bruce Marshall)\nThe Bobcats have won six bowl games in a row, but they will have a new man in charge as coach Brian Smith was fired earlier this month for what the school called \"serious professional misconduct.\" Other than Smith, however, they enter the bowl game pretty much intact, including quarterback Parker Navarro. Led by Navarro, Ohio ranked second in the MAC in both scoring offense (28.7 points per game) and total offense (416.3 yards per game). \"UNLV's defense had trouble slowing balanced foes, and this spread is not insignificant,\" Marshall says. Meanwhile, the SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 69% chance the teams combine to score 62 points or fewer and gives a strong \"A\" grade to Under 62.5.Looking aheadHawaii Bowl: Cal vs. HawaiiTime: 8 p.m. Wednesday | Location: Honolulu | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cal +1.5 | Expert: Hawaii +1.5 (Jeff Hochman)\nChestnuts roasting on an open fire, and two college football teams airing it out. Christmas Eve will feature a Hawaii Bowl with two prolific passing offenses. The Rainbow Warriors rank ninth in the country in passing yards per game (289.7) behind freshman Micah Alejado. Meanwhile, the Golden Bears are 21st (270.8) behind former blue chip recruit Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele. The Golden Bears, however, are going through a transition after coach Justin Wilcox was fired last month. \"The Rainbow Warriors are better on both lines, rank third in redzone scoring compared to Cal's 73rd, and the strength of schedule is closer than you might think,\" Hochman says. However the SportsLine Projection Model disagrees with Hochman and says the Golden Bears have a 70% chance to cover win and gives a \"B\" grade to Cal +1.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After recently opening up Deshaun Watson's 21-day practice window, the Cleveland Browns will not be activating their veteran quarterback this season, coach Kevin Stefanski told reporters on Tuesday. The Browns host the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday before concluding the season with a road game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Watson, 30, has not played since he sustained an Achilles injury during the seventh game of the 2024 season. He then re-aggravated the injury in January. A three-time Pro Bowl quarterback with the Houston Texans, Watson's career took a turn in 2021 when he was sidelined by the Texans for an entire year while facing numerous sexual misconduct allegations from women. Watson had requested a trade prior to the allegations made against him. Despite the allegations, Watson signed a unprecedented five-year, fully-guaranteed $230 million deal with the Browns that offseason after being traded for two future first-round picks in addition to other draft picks. \nMonths after joining the Browns, Watson reached settlements with 20 of the 24 women who had filed a civil lawsuit against him. Watson was then fined $5 million by the NFL and suspended for the first 11 games of the 2022 season. Since that time, Watson has played in just 19 games for the Browns, accruing a 9-10 record in those games. His best season in Cleveland took place in 2023, when he went 5-1 as the team's starter before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury during a win over the Baltimore Ravens. Last season, Watson was completing 63.4% of his passes (his highest total since 2020) before suffering his latest season-ending injury. \nTwo months after the 2024 season concluded, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam admitted regret in terms of the Watson signing. \"We took a big swing and miss with Deshaun,\" Haslam said during the NFL owners meetings. \"We thought we had the quarterback, we didn't and we gave up a lot of draft picks to get him. So we've got to dig ourselves out of that hole. [It] was an entire organization decision, and it ends with Dee and I, so hold us accountable.\"The Browns rebuilt their quarterback room this offseason despite Watson still being under contract through the 2026 season. The team traded Kenny Pickett (who was then traded to the Las Vegas Raiders), signed veteran Joe Flacco and selected Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders in the 2025 NFL Draft. \nFlacco started the season as Cleveland's starter, but he was traded to Cincinnati shortly after he lost his starting job to Gabriel, who subsequently lost his job to Sanders shortly after he sustained a concussion during a Week 11 loss to the Ravens. Sanders has a 1-3 record as Cleveland's starter entering Sunday's game against the Steelers. \n            ",

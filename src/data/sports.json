    "body": "\n        As the National Women's Soccer League prepares for its biggest game of the year, the NWSL Championship (8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+), it finds itself in the midst of another high-stakes moment -- whether its biggest star can be retained. Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman is navigating a pivotal moment in her young career. Her 2025 season has been a balancing act of persistent back injury, with an epic comeback, only for a new injury to hamper her playoff status. She's managed all the highs and lows while operating under the unknown of where she could play next, and now, whether or not this is her last game with the Spirit.\"No, I'm not there at all. And genuinely speaking, like I've made no decisions,\" Rodman told the media on if she's thought about this being her last Spirit game.\"Yeah, there could be conversations being had, but right now, like, I am so excited to be representing the Spirit. I'm not even thinking of when my last game will be. But, yeah, I just want to win it [the championship], and we'll see.\"\nShe's currently on the last year of her contract, a record-setting deal she signed out of her rookie year that was the first-ever million-dollar deal in NWSL at the time. There's been plenty of reporting around the increased interest she's receiving both overseas and even through other competing leagues within the United States.Along with interest from teams in England, DC Power of the USL Super League is interested and has a contract \"significantly larger\" than anything the NWSL can currently offer, according to The Athletic. The league is another division one women's league operating in the U.S., currently in its second year of operation, and operates without a salary cap. On Thursday, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said in response to offers from competitors that the league \"will fight\" to keep Rodman in the league, and the player was moved by the sentiment but was trying to retain her focus on the championship final. \n\"I'm honored to have her say that ... Really happy about that, but at the same time, like, I don't want to put that pressure on myself, of like, because she said that now I'm like, 'Oh shoot. Like, I'm trapped.' But at the same time, I'm focused on this weekend, and that's really all I can focus on, and then moving forward, that's when I really have those conversations and tough calls that I need to have,\" Rodman said. The salary cap has rapidly become a point of contention in a year where multiple players have opted to go play overseas. U.S. national team defender Naomi Girma kicked off the transfer flow of players in January, while winger Alyssa Thompson followed during the summer. Defender Emily Fox has played with Arsenal since 2024, and midfielder Catarina Macario turned pro out of Stanford and began her career in France and is now with Chelsea.The league is bullish on the salary cap as its main mechanism to keep its world-renowned parity. That, to keep a league competitive, means there's talent across clubs, and not just one or two teams. \n\"I'm not, like, a vet in the league, like, there's only so much I can say,\" Rodman shared about retaining talent across the league. \"It's grown so much year to year, so I'm grateful for that. And even a position that I'm in, and the pay that I'm getting already is more than a lot of players, so there's only so much I can speak to, and those are conversations my agents are having. So for me, my focus is on the field. There's only so much I can speak on. Obviously, players want to get paid as much money as they possibly can. So, if that can grow, that'd be amazing. But at the same time, the league is slowly but surely growing every single year.\"Whether or not the salary cap is an appropriate mechanism for the league, its clubs, and players to navigate retention and talent, for Rodman, it's a complex balance with the league she's been with since she was 18 years old.\"I mean, I think it's hard to say. In women's sports, there's always this fight for equal pay to get paid more for the work that we do. But again, like, I'm 23 years old, I'm not going to try to completely change the league and fix that, but at the same time, yeah, we're always going to push and strive for more,\" she said. \nIn the weeks leading up to the end of the season, Rodman has been trying to work her way back from an MCL sprain and be a presence for her team in her limited minutes. She featured off the bench for the Spirit in the semifinal and was a threat on goal even in a brief time on the field. As she looks ahead to the final, she's just trying to find ways to shut out the noise about her contract status and focus on herself and her teammates.\"I think prioritizing just a little bit of alone time, because I think it's important, if that's just listening to music, reading a book, or, I don't know, just hanging out, taking a nap, just having that time for yourself, I think is important,\" Rodman told CBS Sports about managing the chaos around her. \"Being on a team sport, you're always around them, as much as you love them. Sometimes it's like, 'Okay, I need to breathe. I need to just live in the moment and be present.' So that's important. And then also, managing time with family, boyfriend, whatever, and then also coming back. Being able to have Ben [Shelton] here this week has been amazing for me.\"\nRodman leaning on her pro tennis boyfriend isn't new; the two have split time supporting each other at their respective sporting events. Sharing the spotlight has been helpful, especially with decisions looming on the horizon. \"He's just telling me that I'm the driver in this situation, and in life, and that I control whatever I want, and yeah, God is great,\" she said.The Washington Spirit will face Gotham FC on Saturday for the 2025 NWSL Championship. Rodman last won the championship with the Spirit in 2021 during her rookie season. All eyes will be on her whether she starts or features off the bench, as it could be her final game in the NWSL if she decides to leave.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Back in April, the margins between Chelsea and Barcelona seemed unbridgeable, 4-1 defeats home and away cementing the sense that European football's finest club were streaking away from the field. Seven months later and the English champions know just how close they are. What were the margins Thursday? The inches that Ellie Carpenter somehow contrived to find when it seemed so much easier for the scorer of a brilliant opener to double her tally. The flick of the post that denied Wieke Kaptein off Alyssa Thompson's delicate touch. The subatomic particles by which Catarina Macario was offside when her header had unleashed delirium at Stamford Bridge.On many another day, this would have been a win to send a statement to the rest of Europe. Then again, if Chelsea continue to perform at this level, they need not worry too much about that. They will get the points needed for a top-four finish and a swift passage to the quarterfinals. What will matter is the statement sent to Barcelona. This doesn't look like a team who are semifinal fodder in waiting. If these two meet again, they should do so as evenly matched foes.Indeed, if anyone will have to adjust it might be Barcelona, who never really found an answer for what Chelsea wanted to do to them. The hosts had judged their game plan to a tee. When Barcelona had the ball at the back, blue shirts converged on central areas, waiting as long as they had to for Cata Coll to get possession moving. If she wanted to tiptoe 15 yards up the pitch, no matter. Chelsea would not be baited into flinching first in the standoff. If they could stay patient, let Barcelona make the first move, they had a good sense of what would happen next. Even a midfield with Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmati can't pass its way around every roadblock. Sometimes they'd be played through but more infrequently than you might have expected.\nWhen Chelsea did get the ball back, they knew the weak points to hit. Claudia Pina's justified proclivity to vacate her left wing berth and Esmee Brugts' commitment to driving up the field opened up a clear avenue for the breakaway. Carpenter charged into it and kept charging until she found herself just inside the penalty area, a ferocious swing of her right boot serving as evidence that sometimes you can't blame a goalkeeper for being beaten at their near post.A poacher's finish off a scrappy corner from Ewa Pajor had Barcelona level but it did not deliver the rhythm that the Catalans had established early on. Their pursuit of it was further disrupted by a lengthy break in play in the first half as broadcast facilities at Stamford Bridge went haywire. Ten minutes in 30-degree conditions is hardly conducive to anyone performing at the highest level and Bonmati and Putellas in particular seemed to ease off after both breaks.Their first dropped points of the European season will matter little for Barcelona and it would be easy to say that they meandered to the final whistle because they never needed more than the point they clung onto. To do so would be to give discredit to Chelsea though.\nAcross the field, their organization was exemplary. In a way not dissimilar to how she throttled the Spanish at the Euros, Lucy Bronze would track whichever of Putellas, Pina or Pajor happened to be serving as the left winger in that particular passage of play. Carpenter, the dynamo on Chelsea breakaways, dropped back to ensure that wherever her teammate went, a right back was still on hand.Should Barcelona get through, then they found Naomi Girma to be at the top of her game. Nights like these call for so much from top players but often what is required can boil down to the simplest things. For Girma, this was a day for proper old school center backing. See ball, clear ball. There'll be plenty of other opportunities to demonstrate her abilities to progress possession.On this night, it was more important that Chelsea demonstrate their worth as a rival to Barcelona for the biggest prizes. Their collective responses at the final whistle said just how much there would have been to gain from a win. Sonia Bompastor shook her head, Nathalie Bjorn threw her arms up in frustration. There but for the grace of a few pixels went a win.\nAnd yet in the huddle that soon followed, you sensed a different view was emerging. The heavy favorites to win the Champions League had come to town, perhaps not as the best version of themselves, and Chelsea had been better than them. That may matter a great deal when this competition reaches its decisive games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens had never received a hug from his head coach during a game in his four-year NFL career.That changed during the Cowboys' 33-16 \"Monday Night Football\" victory at the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 11. Pickens and All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb were benched for the opening series on Monday in Las Vegas for what at the time was simply revealed to be \"a couple things\" according to head coach Brian Schottenheimer. On Thursday, Lamb admitted the reason he and Pickens were benched was because they were out past curfew on Sunday night at Red Rock Casino Resort in Las Vegas.Once Schottenheimer inserted Lamb and Pickens, particularly the 24-year-old free-agent-to-be, they both thrived. Lamb caught the first touchdown of the night, an 18-yard connection on a play-action toss play. The head coach then ran over to the two of them following Lamb's touchdown catch for a warm group hug on the bench. That marked the first time in Pickens' NFL career that a coach has given him a hug like that in the game. \"Yeah, that's kind of like what I talked about in training camp too. His energy, you know what I mean?\" Pickens said Thursday. \"His energy is so vibrant, it kind of gravitates toward me and bro, CeeDee.\" \nSoon thereafter, Pickens erupted for 144 yards and a touchdown, from 37 yards out, on nine catches. His explosive Monday night on the field ran his receiving yards total to 908 this season, which ranks as the second-most in the NFL behind only Seattle Seahawks wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba's's 1,146. Pickens' 908 yards receiving through 10 games are the most in Cowboys history in a player's first 10 games with the team.  His 10-game start with 908 yards and seven receiving touchdowns on 58 catches also makes Pickens the fourth player in Dallas Cowboys history with at least 900 yards receiving and seven touchdowns through 10 games. He is now alongside Hall of Famers Bob Hayes (1966), Michael Irvin (1995) and Terrell Owens (2007) in that exclusive club.Most receiving yards in first 10 career games with Cowboys, franchise historyReceiving YardsGeorge Pickens (2025)908Amari Cooper (2018-2019)831Raghib Ismail (1999)749Terrell Owens (2006)724Bob Hayes (1965)721Schottenheimer may have disciplined Pickens and Lamb by sitting them out of the first drive of the game, but that's just a blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things in Dallas. The Cowboys head coach and offensive play caller wants Pickens around for years to come. \"Sign me up. I mean, what do you say? Those two guys, I just love their relationship, man. I love the firepower that they give us,\" Schottenheimer said on Tuesday. That's one of those games where you never know which one it's going to be. Some games it's both of them, some games it's one of them, and again, like I said, I pinch myself at times. Because when you're talking about you're Dak or the playcaller, like myself, you're like, OK, if we do this, which way do I throw it to? I like that matchup, but wow, that one is pretty good too. That's real. I'm very in favor of George having a long-term future with us.\"  That sentiment certainly extends to Lamb as well despite having to share the WR1 role with Pickens after years of being quarterback Dak Prescott's unquestioned top target. After Wednesday's walkthrough practice, the team's first of the week after playing Monday at the Raiders, he and Pickens were walking side by side together off the practice and into the locker room. \"It's amazing man. We feed off one another, and he gets us going. He understands that. He knows that. With the energy and everything that he does on the field, off the field, in the locker room, we're cheering -- vibin',\" Lamb said on Thursday. \"The list could go on and on. As far as everything that he's doing and accomplishing, I feel like the standard that has been set for before and all the antics they had going on about him, you don't see none of that going on here. We vibin'.\"The edge that Pickens brings, which at times led to Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin to publicly challenge the wide receiver to grow up, is welcomed in Dallas. That edge can lead to four or five tackles being broken en route to a 21-yard gain on the field as it did in Monday's game. It can also lead to Pickens, for a reason he couldn't explain after the game on Monday, throwing himself into the goal post after scoring a 37-yard touchdown. \"Absolutely. You need that. You need that tenacity,\" Lamb said of Pickens' edge. \"To have that confidence that no one can do anything with you and he's standing at 6-foot-5, it's a tough task.\"Pickens himself has said in the past that he was highly considering wanting to stay with the Cowboys on a long-term contract earlier in the season, but he's making it clear that he indeed wants to be in Dallas long term after his rookie contract expires this offseason. \"Just staying connected with those guys, that's probably all I can say. ... Definitely me keeping relationships with them, still talking to them definitely is going to make me want to stay with them,\" Pickens said Thursday. ... \"Yeah I would probably just say the camaraderie, and the stuff they had going on here before me is kind of what I gelled into. So definitely a good fit here at the Cowboys.\"Pittsburgh viewed Pickens as a pariah in the locker room, which is why they traded him along with a 2027 sixth-round pick to the Cowboys this offseason in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick. In Dallas, he's the NFL's No. 2 leader in receiving yards after being welcomed with open arms -- quirkiness, emotions and all. \n\"I feel like he's comfortable here. He's happy here. He has a home here, and he feels like he's accepted,\" Lamb said. \"I feel like we did a great job, welcoming him with open arms, and everything he did in Pittsburgh? Bring that here. We're going to figure out everything else and how we have to grow as men and a football player off the field, but other than that, come be you. I feel like, with that, it was very easy for him. He understood that we weren't trying to change him. We wanted him to come over and do that, and that he's doing. He's actually exceeded that. Shoutout to GP, man.\"Would Lamb say Pickens is being embraced, literally and metaphorically, more in Dallas than he was in Pittsburgh? \"Yeah, absolutely,\" Lamb said. ... I feel like all we can control is what we do and how comfortable we make him and have him make an easier pitch as to wanting to be here. Us as teammates, we understand the situation, especially being that we've come from it recently, some maybe once or twice,\" Lamb said. ... \"I'm sure that he wants to be here, how much fun he's having and everything he's accomplishing on the field. For us, as his teammates, I feel like it's pretty clear that we want GP back.\"  \nKnowing Lamb, Schottenheimer and others want him back long-term has Pickens feeling the same way. \"I'd love to be back with bro [Lamb], especially him,\" Pickens said. \"Dak, all the guys really.\" The connection with Schottenheimer is something that plays \"a lot\" into Pickens' feeling comfortable in his fit on the team and something he will heavily be weighing when figuring out how to handle his contractual future next offseason. \n\"A lot. Me and Schotty, I think we're still getting even closer and closer. We were close before, and I feel now we're getting even closer,\" Pickens said. ... \"Definitely with the types of plays and play calling. The stuff that he brings to the table, definitely a huge factor.\"Prescott's word carries plenty of weight around the building in the Cowboys organization, and he's alrighty nudged both Pickens and owner and general manager Jerry Jones about getting the wide receiver re-signed. Now, the proverbial ball is in Jones' court. \"I think that'd [re-signing Pickens] be a priority in the offseason. Right now, has it come up? Obviously probably it has maybe joking here or there, whether it be to George or whether it be to Jerry,\" Prescott said. \"So all positive talks and conversations I would feel would start that the right way. But I'm all in for it.\" \n            ",

Stroud (concussion) is out, but creating a Texans vs. Bills SGP could still lean on several big names like Josh Allen, James Cook and Nico Collins. With both teams possessing top-3 passing defenses, though, many may lean on the running backs with NFL props and when looking to construct a winning NFL same-game parlay. Additionally, not only is Stroud out, but Buffalo will be without Dalton Kincaid and Keon Coleman, both of whom are inactive.The Bills are favored by 5.5 points, per the latest NFL odds, and the over/under is 43.5. Apart from Cook, Houston's tandem of Woody Marks and Nick Chubb could factor into NFL player props and TNF best bets. One also can't forget about what Allen can do on the ground as he had three rushing scores last week and has the shortest NFL odds as an anytime touchdown scorer at -125.

Mills has looked impressive in a couple of start but that came against the lowly Titans and the Jaguars' 26th-ranked passing defense. He will face a much more formidable foe on TNF in Buffalo, which possesses the league's No. 2 pass defense. The Bills have held each of their last two opposing quarterbacks to exactly 173 passing yards.Only three quarterbacks have gone Over 211.5 passing yards versus Buffalo in 2025, including the likes of Patrick Mahomes and Drake Maye. Mills isn't on their level, and with Buffalo having the 31st-ranked run defense, Houston should heavily lean on the ground game. The AI model projects Mills to have 169.2 passing yards.

    "body": "\n        The first month of the 2025-26 NBA season has almost felt like a practice run for the LaMelo Ball trade sweepstakes, which seemingly began Thursday when Yahoo reported that Charlotte's star point guard is now open to a deal. Ja Morant's tantrum against the Memphis coaching staff reminded us all that supply sorely outpaces demand on the point guard market. Anthony Davis' future in Dallas became uncertain the moment Nico Harrison was fired, but the seemingly tepid response to his potential availability is a testament to how scared potential traders are of meaningful health risks. Sacramento's slow start drew predictable reporting about the lack of interest in Zach LaVine thanks to his contract.These are all concerns that apply to Ball, at least on some level. He plays the league's most crowded position, and not especially often either, as he has appeared in just 114 games since the beginning of the 2022-23 campaign. He has three fully guaranteed seasons left on a max rookie extension after this year, though thankfully he failed to earn eligibility for a Rose Rule bump, so his deal started at a more manageable 25% of the cap. He's never reached the playoffs. He's never played defense. His efficiency is significantly down this season. He checks every single box on the high-risk trade target chart.\nAnd yet ... he probably will, or at least should, draw more interest on the trade market than the others. He's still only 24. He's never played for a stable and functioning NBA organization. James Borrego made lemonade with what Michael Jordan gave him and by the time the team was sold to an ownership group seemingly ready to invest more in team-wide infrastructure, the roster had degraded to the point where it had no choice but to tank. How many of those absences would have been avoided if Ball actually had something to play for?You could ask a version of that question for just about every concern Ball raises. He's never defended in the NBA, but that doesn't mean he lacks tools. He's a big, athletic guard with a lot of bad habits that a strong organization might be able to teach out of him. Does he take circus shots out of a misplaced sense of showmanship, or does he do it because his underwhelming supporting cast makes it harder for him to find more traditional looks? Is he a carnival act or a superstar? Can he be both?\nThe answer is maybe, but we'll probably never know in Charlotte. This is a supremely talented 24-year-old basketball player. There's stardom in here somewhere for a team capable of finding it. So, with apologies to many of the bottom-dwellers that tend to pop up in trade talks like this (we're looking at you, Sacramento), let's try to find Ball a team in which he'll really have a fighting chance at maximizing that prodigious talent. Here are five trade destinations that make some sense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ClippersThere's something poetic about sending the Chino Hills star back home after the other Los Angeles team traded his brother just two years into his career. The Clippers are always looking for ways of one-upping the Lakers and Charlotte might have one waiting for them on a silver platter. More pressingly, the Clippers are an exceedingly old team with no clear future. Ball is at least a direction. He's someone who can fill an arena for a few years and maybe help you recruit year next big fish. Ty Lue is perfectly capable of holding stars accountable. If you can get away with calling out LeBron James, you can probably nudge Ball away from his worst on-court impulses.The short-term basketball fit is a bit more of a question. The Clippers badly need an offensive spark after shipping out Norman Powell and signing Bradley Beal, who's already out for the year. Ball's specific gifts could fill in some blanks for a roster that lacks creativity beyond James Harden and athleticism really anywhere. Only the Nets are scoring fewer fast-break points per game than the Clippers, and Brooklyn is trying to lose. Ball addresses that weakness at least, though pairing him and Harden more or less ends any hopes of recapturing last year's defensive excellence.\nThere are real cost questions on both sides. The Clippers can trade two first-round picks (2030 and 2032) along with a first-round swap (2031). Is that enough to convince the Hornets to part with someone they've treated as a franchise player? Conversely, are the Clippers prepared to bet their few remaining assets on Ball, especially when the looming threat of the Kawhi Leonard investigation could strip them of even more draft picks down the line? Get this trade right and you have a future. You have Ball, Ivica Zubac and the cap space to improve around him. Get it wrong and it might set you back a decade. It's up to them to decide if the risk outweighs the reward. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami HeatI know, I know, we do this for every reputation rehabilitation candidate, but we do it for a reason. None of that Charlotte nonsense would fly in Miami. If we assume Ball needs structure, this is where he'll find it. It's a far more appealing roster as well. The Heat are loaded with bigger defenders and the emergence of Davion Mitchell ensures that Ball could almost always be hidden on weaker matchups. The ultra-fast, pass-heavy offense the Heat installed this season has started to fade a bit. Some of that is some early 3-point variance starting to turn. Some of it is the lack of star power. There's no real engine here, it's the system. Tyler Herro hasn't even played yet.That's the core question here. Would Miami rather have Herro or Ball? It doesn't make sense to build around two defenders that vulnerable and their offensive fit is messy as well. You're not getting nearly enough rim pressure out of those two given the money they'd cost. Inertia tends to favor the incumbent, but the Heat are bolder than most. They've been big-game hunting for decades, and they notably didn't give Herro an extension over the summer. If they're at all hesitant on that front, some sort of Ball trade is a convenient way out. They'd likely have to include draft capital, but the Heat are facing the same existential questions the Clippers are. If they think Ball can be a franchise player, he's worth the risk. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston RocketsThe actual trade cost for Houston would be pretty trivial. The Rockets can match money easily enough with Fred VanVleet (provided he waives his right to veto a deal), Dorian Finney-Smith and a third, smaller salary. They're so loaded with draft picks that shipping out a couple of first-rounders is easy enough as well. The Rockets have the chips to trade for almost anyone. That's why they won't trade for just anyone.Do you want to go all-in on LaMelo Ball now, when you already look like a championship contender and can save your bullets for someone safer in a few years? How easily could Ball integrate into the existing structure? He doesn't exactly fit in a defense-first culture unless the hope is that he'd adapt on a team (and for a coach) that demands it. He's fortunately, at least theoretically, relatively low-maintenance as offensive stars go. Getting him doesn't necessarily mean taking the ball away from Alperen Sengun or Kevin Durant. Really, taking the ball-handling burden off of Amen Thompson's shoulders would probably be helpful.It's probably a no for Houston at this stage. The idea of trading for Ball would be to add shooting and playmaking that they're getting from Reed Sheppard in smaller doses. The upgrade probably isn't big enough to justify the cost. But Houston is so asset-rich and depending so much on such young players that the Rockets will inevitably pop up whenever any star guard hits the market. If the price is low enough, it's not crazy.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas MavericksThe broader organization in Dallas is, obviously, a mess. There are, however, a few factors that make Dallas appealing in spite of that. There are already two Hall of Fame point guards in the building between Jason Kidd and Kyrie Irving. Both can be pretty mercurial, but both are by and large revered among players. Cooper Flagg is the ideal long-term, on-court partner for Ball. Flagg can do just about everything except run an offense, as Dallas' ill-fated point guard experiment early in the season showed. Ball would make his life far easier on offense. Flagg, in turn, would do all of the little things Ball has never really done.Dallas is still fairly thin on first-rounders. At present, they can only offer their 2031 pick and swap rights in 2032 and, considering they don't control their picks between 2027 and 2030, they'd effectively be betting the Flagg era on Ball and their 2026 first-round pick, whoever it turns out to be. The caveat here is that the Mavericks are ultimately expected to trade Anthony Davis. If they refill their coffers that way, they might have enough to take a run at Ball without bankrupting their future. Besides, with Flagg on a rookie deal, the Mavericks could justify fitting Ball's max deal onto their balance sheet more easily than most suitors. After all, his contract expires right as Flagg would start his rookie extension, so if Ball doesn't work out, Dallas would never have to worry about paying him and Flagg max money at the same time.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Portland Trail BlazersHey, speaking of teams with Hall of Fame guards in the building, Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday would probably be good influences on Ball. The Blazers want to win now, but Scoot Henderson, who Charlotte considered drafting at No. 2 in 2023, hasn't played yet this season. His first two years have done little to show that he can be the offensive centerpiece they'll need for the long haul, and now that they're trying to be competitive immediately, it's going to be harder to justify the sort of minutes he'll need to develop properly.\nCharlotte can obviously offer those minutes, and Henderson's speed would fit quite well next to rising star Kon Knueppel, who looks like one of the best shooters in the NBA already. So how about a swap of young guards? Charlotte would get Henderson and Jerami Grant as matching salary. Portland would push even more chips into the win-now bucket by turning Henderson into a 24-year-old who has actually made an All-Star team in Ball. The stellar defense that carried Portland down the stretch last season hasn't shown up yet this year, but if you assume it comes around, the Blazers largely have that end of the floor solved. Offense is the long-term question, and Ball could be their answer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Despite being 8-2 and fresh off a Super Bowl win, there continues to be a lot of negativity surrounding the Philadelphia Eagles. At the forefront of this negativity has been wideout A.J. Brown, the Eagles' talented yet disgruntled receiver who hasn't been shy about voicing his frustration with his and the offense's underwhelming production through 10 games. Brown threw more gas on the fire on Thursday when asked about speculation that he isn't the same player that he once was. \"I guess Saquon ain't the same player either, then,\" Brown said. \"I don't care about that.\"\nObviously, Brown putting the spotlight on Barkley's struggles this season is not a good look. It's yet another example of the missteps Brown has taken this season, both on and off the field. But while mentioning another teammate may not have been the best approach, Brown has a point in that you'd be hard-pressed to find any Eagles offensive player who is performing at the level they did a year ago. If Barkley is getting a \"pass\" for his underwhelming numbers, why isn't Brown? The answer to that question might be rooted in the fact that -- unlike Barkley and quarterback Jalen Hurts -- Brown is airing his grievances in a multitude of ways that appear to be detrimental to the Eagles. \nOn the field, Brown has often appeared either frustrated, moody, dejected, disinterested, or a combination of all four. It's worth questioning if his negative body language has contributed to his and the Eagles' offensive struggles this season.\n Off the field, Brown has made headlines for the wrong reasons. His recent comments on a livestream reportedly led to him having a 10-minute conversation with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie. Brown may the figurehead of the current lack of brotherly love in Philadelphia, but he isn't alone. On Wednesday, for example, Hurts had to field questions stemming from a report that coaches and teammates have grown frustrated with him. \n\"I guess I get a lot of attention when things are going well and when things are not going so well,\" Hurts said. \"I never run away from holding myself accountable, and I think that's exactly what I've taken the approach of doing. I take great pride in what we do on offense. I take great pride in how we go out there and play as a team and what our flow is. I think we've got work to do, and that obviously starts with me. That's always my approach. That's always me looking internally first in everything that we do and then in due time rising above.\"While they may be the most dysfunctional Super Bowl caliber team since the 1995 Cowboys, the Eagles still have a lot of football ahead of them. And despite their dysfunction, Philadelphia is currently sitting at 8-2 and are running away with the NFC East title. When it comes to Brown, his frustration does appear to be coming from a good place. He wants to have a larger role in the offense in an effort to help the unit realize its full potential. His next change to do that will be this Sunday in Dallas against the arch rival Cowboys. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Buffalo Bills and Houston Texans will meet on 'Thursday Night Football,' with both squads playing some of their best ball as of late. Each has won three of its last four, with Buffalo (7-3) sitting second in the AFC East, while Houston (5-5) is third in the AFC South. The Bills knocked off Tampa, 44-32, in Week 11, as Josh Allen accounted for six total touchdowns. Meanwhile, Houston recorded a 16-13 Sunday victory over Tennessee giving the Texans their second straight win with Davis Mills filling in for C.J. Stroud (concussion), who remains out. Inactive for Buffalo are tight end Dalton Kincaid and receiver Keon Coleman. The Bills are currently the No. 5 seed in the AFC, while Houston is the No. 8 seed.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from NRG Stadium in Houston. The Texans have won five straight home games versus Buffalo, including a 23-20 triumph last season. The latest Texans vs. Bills odds have Buffalo as a 5-point favorite, after opening as 2.5-point favorites. The over/under for total points is 44.5.

He had three passing touchdowns and three rushing touchdowns for the second such game with those stats in his career, and no other player in NFL history even has one such regular season game. With his dual-threat ability, plus James Cook, Buffalo leads the league in rushing offense. On the other side of the ball, Buffalo is elite at defending through the air, ranking in the top five in both passing yards allowed and passing touchdowns given up. Struggling to move the ball through the air would cause tons of problems for Houston, as the Texans have a bottom-10 rush offense and rank 31st in red-zone scoring. Also, Houston is winless against the spread (0-3) as an underdog in 2025. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Texans can coverThere's no better unit in all of football than Houston's defense, which boasts No. 1 rankings in both scoring defense and total defense. The Texans have no holes on that side of the ball, with additional top-three rankings versus the run, versus the pass and on third downs. Houston also has a big edge in the all-important turnover differential metric at +7, compared to the Bills being at +1. Additionally, the Bills' No. 31 run defense could get a middling rush offense like Houston's going, and you can't ignore the recent history of this series. The Texans are 5-0 outright and 4-1 against the spread over their last five home games versus Buffalo, while the Bills are 3-5 ATS as a favorite this season.. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bills vs. Texans picksFor the NFL Week 12 'Thursday Night Football' game of Texans vs. Bills, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 43 combined points.

I was starting to get worried, but not anymore. The temperatures are getting colder, but I am getting hotter.I went 10-5 both against the spread and straight up last week, which is a nice departure from my losing weeks for the two before that. My record for the year is now 85-79 ATS and 110-53-1 straight up.Anytime you can be over .500 picking every game against the spread this late in the season, it's a good one. So let's build on it and keep it going. It's my time. The stretch run is here. Bet NFL Week 12 games and NFL odds at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass:Pittsburgh Steelers at Chicago Bears (-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis might be a Steelers team without Aaron Rodgers (wrist), which means it could be Mason Rudolph time. He is a capable backup, but this will put a lot of pressure on the Steelers run game. If it's Rodgers, how limited will he be? The Bears have played a lot of close games, winning most of them, and this will be no different. The Bears will squeak another one out late. Pick: Bears 23, Steelers 21 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookNew England Patriots (-7.5) at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Patriots are riding high, while the Bengals are going in the opposite direction. The Bengals will be without suspended receiver Ja'Marr Chase in this one, which will challenge them even more. The Patriots will be rested having played last Thursday, which is is an advantage. They will keep it rolling behind Drake Maye as they win a shootout. Pick: Patriots 35, Bengals 30 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNew York Giants at Detroit Lions (-10.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Lions are coming off a tough loss to the Eagles and now must regroup at home against a Giants team that isn't going anywhere. The Giants might have Jaxson Dart back at quarterback this week, but it won't matter who plays quarterback. This will be about the Lions offense getting back on track after disappointing last week. They roll. Pick: Lions 31, Giants 10 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20XMinnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers (-6.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Vikings are getting little from quarterback J.J. McCarthy and as a result this is a must-win game for them. The Packers still haven't quite clicked yet on offense either and now must play without Josh Jacobs (knee). That's not good, but it will force them to open it up, which is a good thing. Jordan Love will play well and win it with that more-open style. Pick: Packers 27, Vikings 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookSeattle Seahawks (-13) at Tennessee Titans Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Seahawks are playing consecutive road games after losing to the Rams last week in Los Angeles. Sam Darnold threw four picks in that game, but the defense played well to keep it close. The Titans don't do anything on offense, so look for the Seattle defense to dominate here. Seahawks get back on track. Pick: Seahawks 24, Titans 7 | Odds via BetMGMIndianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is the game of the week, featuring a Colts team coming off a bye against a Chiefs team that can't afford another loss. The Colts have rolled on offense this season, but this is a spot where the Kansas City defense steps up and plays well. The Chiefs win it with a desperate season-saving showing as Patrick Mahomes bounces back. Pick: Chiefs 26, Colts 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookFor more Colts vs. Chiefs picks, head on over to the CBSSports.com expert picks page.New York Jets at Baltimore Ravens (-13.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jets are making a change at quarterback with Tyrod Taylor in as the starter. Does it really matter? The Ravens had won three straight to right things as they push the Steelers in the division. The offense still hasn't played great, but I think this is the game for Lamar Jackson to get back to looking like himself after his hamstring injury a few weeks back. Ravens win it. Pick: Ravens 30, Jets 13 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookCleveland Browns at Las Vegas Raiders (-3)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis will be Shedeur Sanders making his first start for the Browns. The good news is he's facing a Raiders team that struggles against the pass. The Raiders offense has issues protecting Geno Smith as well, which could be setting up a big day for Myles Garrett. The Browns will win a low-scoring game. Pick: Browns 20, Raiders 17 | Odds via BetMGMJacksonville Jaguars (-2.5) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a long trip for a team coming off a big victory like the Jaguars did last week against the Chargers. Focus could be an issue with a young team, but I still think they found something on offense last week. That will carry over here. They get the best of an Arizona team that is struggling. Jaguars win it. Pick: Jaguars 28, Cardinals 23 | Odds via BetMGMPhiladelphia Eagles (-4.5) at Dallas CowboysSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Cowboys will pose a real challenge for the Eagles defense with the way Dak Prescott can light up the scoreboard. Philadelphia hasn't been great on offense, so the question is whether they can get it going. Not having Lane Johnson will hurt. Look for a lot of points here as the Cowboys pull off an upset. Pick: Cowboys 33, Eagles 31 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookAtlanta Falcons at New Orleans Saints (-1.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Saints are coming off a bye and they face a Falcons team without quarterback Michael Penix. That means it's Kirk Cousins for the Falcons. He didn't do a lot in relief last week. The Saints won the last time out behind their defense and some timely throws from Tyler Shough. I think that same formula will win here. Pick: Saints 24, Falcons 20 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookTampa Bay Buccaneers at Los Angeles Rams (-6.5)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Bucs are playing consecutive road games after losing at Buffalo to the Bills, and now must travel across the country to play one of the league's best. That will be a challenge. The Rams defense picked off Sam Darnold four times last week, so they are playing well. Baker Mayfield will keep his team in this one, but the Rams will win it late. Pick: Rams 28, Bucs 26 | Odds via BetMGMCarolina Panthers at San Francisco 49ers (-6.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a long road trip for a Monday night game against a good team for the Panthers. It's also a second straight road game, which is tough. The 49ers got Brock Purdy back last week and he impressed. Bryce Young also played well for the Panthers. I think this could be a fun one to watch with the 49ers defense struggling. Look for the 49ers to win a high-scoring game. Pick: 49ers 32, Panthers 23 | Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday's showdown between No. 7 USC (8-2) and No. 13 Oregon (9-1) gives B1G Time on CBS a West Coast collision with major College Football Playoff stakes. With both teams fighting to stay in the hunt for a spot in the 12-team bracket, the stage delivers the essence of late-November football.Oregon has rattled off four straight wins since its October loss to Indiana, while Lincoln Riley and the Trojans are on a surge of their own, winning four consecutive Big Ten games for the first time. USC is coming off a gritty win over Iowa in the rare Los Angeles rain, but the program has just one victory at Autzen Stadium in its last five trips dating to 2007.Both teams are long known for high-powered offenses, but the shift into the Big Ten has added a tougher edge. What once felt like a track meet could now play more like a bruising battle, with two of the nation's most efficient rushing attacks driving the matchup. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming live on Paramount+.  USC vs. Oregon: Need to know  Playoff paths: Oregon would make the 12-team CFP bracket if it started today, but USC still has work to do at No. 13 in the committee's latest rankings. A win would give the Trojans a major résumé boost heading into their regular-season finale against crosstown rival UCLA. For the Ducks, a loss could be damaging — even with just two defeats — because they lack a win over any team currently in the CFP rankings.Efficient offenses: Oregon (39.0 points per game) and USC (38.2) both boast top-10 scoring attacks. First-year starting quarterback Dante Moore has shown poise in key moments, but the Ducks lean on a deep backfield that averages 6.31 yards per carry against FBS opponents, best in the nation. For the Trojans, walk-on running back King Miller provides a spark, but the star remains wideout Makai Lemon, one of only three FBS players to reach 1,000 receiving yards this season.\nMargins matter: Oregon (+23.0) and USC (+16.5) also rank in the top 10 nationally in scoring margin. But the Trojans have struggled away from home, posting just a +2.0 average margin in true road games (32nd in the FBS). While Lincoln Riley has picked up two Big Ten road wins this season — at Nebraska and Purdue — he is only 2-6 in road games outside California since USC joined the conference last year.  Where to watch USC vs. Oregon liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Autzen Stadium -- Eugene, OregonTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium USC vs. Oregon prediction, picks  \nIt goes without saying that the team that comes out on top will get the most from its top offensive stars. For Oregon, that means big contributions from Noah Whittington and Kenyon Sadiq — especially if Dante Moore and Gary Bryant Jr. remain sidelined. Whittington averages an eye-popping 8.2 yards per carry, third-most among FBS players with at least 60 attempts, a major challenge for a USC defense that has struggled against the run at times. The Ducks' clearest path to victory is simple: sustain long drives and keep USC's passing attack off the field. Pick: Oregon -10.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        No. 17 Texas took a tumble down the College Football Playoff Rankings following last week's 35-10 loss at Georgia. The Longhorns fell seven spots in the poll, and now find themselves in serious danger of being left out of the College Football Playoff this season. This is the reality of any team with three losses.However, not all hope is lost. Texas still has a possible path back into the field, and the formula is pretty simple: win the final two games. While beating a 2-8 Arkansas team won't do much to boost their stock, the Longhorns will finish the regular season with a game against No. 3 Texas A&M. A win there could provide a boost large enough to snatch an at-large.But they have to win this game first, and don't let Arkansas' 2-8 record fool you. This team has made a habit of sticking around in games when it isn't expected to, and you know they would love to destroy Texas' season for good.Texas vs. Arkansas: Need to know  Texas has won 19 straight home games against unranked teams: The Longhorns have lost six games since the start of the 2024 season and five of those losses have come against Ohio State and Georgia. The third Georgia loss came last week in a 35-10 defeat in Athens. While the Longhorns lost to Florida earlier this year, it was in Gainesville, which kept Texas' home win streak alive against unranked opponents. The last home loss to a team outside the polls was a wild 57-56 loss to Kansas during the 2021 season. Of the 19 straight wins, 17 have come by at least 10 points.  The Texas defense is struggling: The Texas defense had been its strength all year, but it comes into this game having allowed at least 30 points in its last three games. The Arkansas offense has been one of the more explosive attacks in the SEC this season, and if the Hogs crack 30, it'll be the first time Texas has allowed 30 or more in four straight games since that same 2021 season.  \nArkansas has a positive point differential: What's the big deal about that? Well, Arkansas is 2-8 on the season, and one of those eight losses came by 43 points. Yet, some how, some way, the Hogs have still scored more points than they've allowed. How's that possible? Well, five of their eight losses have come by three points or fewer. That's tied for the most in one season by any FBS program this century.

And it's not just Georgia and Vanderbilt. Mississippi State was able to put 38 points on the board, and their offense isn't all that dissimilar to what Arkansas does. That, combined with the chance Texas may have its eyes looking slightly forward to the A&M game, make me think this one won't be a blowout. Pick: Arkansas +10.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        A trip to the College Football Playoff is off the table for No. 20 Tennessee, but the Volunteers have plenty to play for as they enter a two-game closing stretch against rivalry opponents that begins Saturday at Florida. The Volunteers will be seeking their first road win over the Gators since 2003 as they travel to take on a struggling UF team with no path to a bowl.While a postseason bid is not available to the Gators (3-7), facing the Volunteers marks the first of two straight home rivalry showdowns to end the season. Taking on Tennessee this week and Florida State next week gives UF a chance to close a frustrating campaign with purpose.Playing Tennessee offers a shot at revenge for Florida after it suffered a crushing overtime loss to the Volunteers last season. Tennessee's 23-17 win over the Gators in 2024 snapped a five-game losing streak in the series and set the Vols on a path to the College Football Playoff.There isn't a viable path back to the CFP for Tennessee at this point. But closing the regular season with a pair of victories would get the Vols to 9-3 and give them a chance to secure a 10th victory in a bowl game. If that 3-0 finish comes to fruition, it would mark the program's third season of double-digit victories in four years under fifth-year coach Josh Heupel.\nFlorida vs. Tennessee: Need to know  Turnover troubles: This is a matchup of two of the SEC's most mistake-prone quarterbacks. Florida's DJ Lagway has thrown 13 interceptions, which is second-most nationally. Tennessee's Joey Aguilar is tied for fourth with 10 interceptions, including four in his last two games. The Gators are tied for 88th nationally with a minus-2 turnover margin. While Tennessee is plus-3 for the season in turnover margin, it gave up game-changing defensive touchdowns in losses to both Alabama and Oklahoma.Series changing: These former SEC East rivals have met annually every year since 1990, but that's about to change. With the SEC's new scheduling format taking hold next season, the Volunteers and Gators will no longer be annual foes. Tennessee will play Alabama, Kentucky and Vanderbilt as permanent rivals over the next four years while Florida will play Georgia, South Carolina and Kentucky. The teams will renew their series in 2027 at Tennessee, but the Volunteers won't make another trip to Florida until 2029.Ongoing coaching search: While closing with rivalry opponents like Tennessee and Florida State gives Gators fans a reasons to stay engaged with the on-field product, the focus for most who follow Florida has been on the future for several weeks now. Even before head coach Billy Napier was fired amid a 3-4 start, the writing was on the wall to suggest a regime change was likely coming. Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin is at the top of Florida's wishlist in its pursuit of a new coach, but Tulane's Jon Sumrall is also in the mix. Both are also in the running for other jobs, though, which means the Gators search could get interesting in the days ahead.\n  Where to watch Florida vs. Tennessee live  Date: Saturday, November 22 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Location: Ben Hill Griffin Stadium -- Gainesville, Florida  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)Florida vs. Tennessee prediction, picks  \nFlorida's will to defend the run appears to be fading as the Gators plunge deeper into what's become a hopeless season. At 3-7, Florida has officially been disqualified from contention for a bowl game and now must deal with a Tennessee offense that still has explosive potential. Crippling turnovers have been an Achilles heel for the Volunteers this season, but the Gators have actually been worse in that department. This is the time for Tennessee to end its 10-game losing streak in The Swamp. Pick: Tennessee -4\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

    "body": "\n        No. 8 Oklahoma can almost taste the College Football Playoff. The Sooners will be favored in each of their final two regular-season games, likely needing to go 2-0 to clinch a spot in the CFP bracket. The first of those contests comes at home Saturday against No. 22 Missouri, a team -- despite being down its starting quarterback and rolling with a true freshman -- that just put up 49 points against an SEC opponent in Mississippi State.The Week 13 matchup has letdown potential for the Sooners after they posted consecutive wins over ranked opponents. The Tigers are a tough out, having played both Alabama and Vanderbilt to one possession. But with John Mateer leading the offense and Brent Venables poised to cook up another vicious defensive game plan, Oklahoma has everything it needs to take care of business. If the Sooners can make life tough on quarterback Matt Zollers and keep star running back Ahmad Hardy in check, they should pick up their third consecutive win.Oklahoma and Missouri played almost annually for a century, but this is just the second meeting between the former Big 12 rivals since 2011. The Tigers took their debut SEC showdown last season in a 30-23 win in Columbia.Neither side has life in the SEC Championship race, so it is full steam ahead towards the playoff for Oklahoma and all eyes getting to a premier bowl game for Missouri.\nOklahoma vs. Missouri: Need to knowPoints at a premium: The scoreboard operator in Norman might have a nice, calm afternoon on Saturday. The defenses in this matchup are two of the 11 stingiest units in college football in yards allowed per game. Moving the ball on the ground is borderline impossible against Oklahoma, which ranks No. 3 against the run, and Missouri does not let much fly with its No. 15 pass defense. Sooners defensive lineman David Stone is arguably the most fearsome standout between the two units, and that the Midseason All-American comes off the bench is a testament to Oklahoma's elite depth up front.Zollers settles in: The first start of Zollers' young career did not go swimmingly. In fact, that is an understatement. The Missouri quarterback delivered a putrid 7-for-22 passing effort in a blowout loss to Texas A&M two weeks ago. But while his accuracy only improved slightly in his second outing, the former blue-chip recruit gained some necessary confidence in the Tigers' rout of Mississippi State, tossing a pair of touchdowns. Zollers will have his hands full with his toughest test to date on Saturday.Pound the rock: Both teams like to run the ball at a high rate, but doing so against these defenses will be a challenge. Missouri's offense is a ground-oriented operation that runs on nearly 60% of its snaps, and it's hard to blame Eli Drinkwitz for handing the ball off so often with Hardy leading the nation in rushing yards. The sophomore ballcarrier just posted the best performance of his career with a 300-yard, three-touchdown explosion and has crossed the century mark in all but three games. Oklahoma, meanwhile, has one of the country's most lethal quarterback run games with Mateer leading all ballcarriers in attempts (104) and touchdowns (7).\nWhere to watch Oklahoma vs. Missouri liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, OklahomaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Oklahoma vs. Missouri prediction, picks\nThe defenses are the two most reliable units in this matchup. On the Oklahoma side, Venables should have plenty up his sleeve for an inexperienced quarterback in Zollers who has yet to find much footing. His run-stopping unit will be the best that Hardy has seen all year, too, so another 300-yard effort is almost certainly not in the cards for the Doak Walker Award candidate. Simply put, there is no straightforward path for the Tigers to move the ball. With both teams content to run at a high rate -- thus keeping the clock ticking -- and both defenses ranking among the nation's best, it should not take more than a couple scores to decide this game. Just be wary of a defensive touchdown.

    "body": "\n        The first two years of the dynamic kickoff era in the NFL brought an uptick in returns, fulfilling the league's goal of increasing action on special teams. The shift in formats in 2024 brought fairly radical changes, and the NFL continues to assess and tweak its rules to find the sweet spot between excitement and safety. Many coaches embraced the refreshed kickoff model, but it is not without its points of contention, including the elimination of surprise onside kicks and introduction of the 35-yard touchback.President Donald Trump is among those to voice displeasure with the dynamic kickoff format. Earlier this season, he called it \"demeaning\" to the game of football and said he urged commissioner Roger Goodell to revert to more traditional rules.Kansas City Chiefs special teams coach Dave Toub was not having any of that criticism, though.\"He doesn't even know what he's looking at,\" Toub said in Thursday's media availability. \"He has no idea what's going on with the kickoff rule. Take that for what it's worth. I hope he hears it.\"\nTrump's primary point of contention pertains to the delay from the kick to the moment coverage players are allowed to move. Players on the kicking team line up on the opposing 40-yard line while players on the receiving team stand between their own 30-and 35-yard lines and are not allowed to move until the ball lands or hits a returner.\"I hate the kickoff in football,\" Trump said last week on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think it's so terrible. I think it's so demeaning. I think it hurts the game, it hurts the pageantry. I've told that to Roger Goodell. And I don't think it's any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other. It's the opposite of what the game -- the ball is in the air, nobody's moving. It's supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you're supposed to be moving. The pageantry of the game is so badly hurt.\"In an effort to further increase the frequency of returns, the NFL ahead of the 2025 season modified its touchback rule, bringing the ball out to the 35-yard line instead of the 30 (in the first year of the dynamic kickoff model) or the 25 (prior to dynamic kickoffs).Returns are up again in 2025The experimental year of the dynamic kickoff format delivered precisely what the NFL sought: an increase in return frequency. The return rate grew to 32.8%, up from the 21.8% mark from the final year of the old format (which was the lowest rate in NFL history). The average length of return also ballooned from 23 yards to 27.5 yards.But it was not the dramatic increase the league desired, so it made the change this year to touchbacks in an effort to further improve the odds of a return. So far, so good in that regard. \nLeague data obtained by The Athletic showed that through Week 7, players returned an astounding 79.3% of kickoffs, marking more than a 100% uptick from the first seven weeks of the 2024 season. Lengthy returns are also up significantly this season. There were 32 returns of at least 40 yards through Week 7 this year, more than double the 13 from that same time period a year ago.Players may not be in motion while the ball is in the air like Trump said he prefers. But once they get the green light, they produce more action than they did under previous kickoff formats.Injury rate fluctuates with format changesTrump contested that dynamic kickoffs are no safer than standard kickoffs, but NFL data from 2024 indicated otherwise. The league said that the concussion rate on kickoffs dropped by 43% in the first year of the dynamic model and that the overall injury rate was the same as on all plays from scrimmage.\nHowever, with the uptick in returns in 2025 also came more concussions. League data showed that, through Week 7, the rate of concussions per 100 kickoffs jumped from 0.09 last year to 1.18 this year. The NFL acknowledged that the uptick in overall injuries was expected.Player safety was among the reasons for the move to the dynamic kickoff format, and the restriction of full-speed movement projected to reduce serious injuries.\n            ",

Bet it at bet365 here:\nBroncos +4.5 vs. PatriotsDenver finds itself as a 4.5-point underdog due to quarterback Bo Nix's ankle injury against Buffalo last weekend. Jarrett Stidham steps in as the starter for the AFC Championship. While he has not thrown a pass in a game in two years, Stidham has been in the NFL for six seasons. He is backed up by a Broncos defense that led the league in sacks during the regular season and forced five turnovers against the Bills last week. Denver is the biggest home underdog ever in a conference championship, but the model has the Broncos covering the spread in 58% of simulations. Back the Broncos at bet365 here:Seahawks -2.5 vs. Rams Seattle used a fourth-quarter comeback and a 2-point conversion in overtime to beat Los Angeles in December, and the Seahawks enter the NFC Championship on an eight-game winning streak. That loss marked the beginning of a lengthy stretch of traveling for Los Angeles, which is on the road for the fifth time in six weeks. The Rams needed a last-second score to beat Carolina during the wild-card round before beating Chicago in overtime last weekend.

The total closed at 42.5 in that matchup, and these teams have gone Under in 10 of their last 14 meetings. Seattle's defense has given up a combined 44 points in six of its last seven games, excluding the win over Los Angeles. The Rams notched a 21-19 win over the Seahawks in November, as the Rams picked off Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold four times. The model is projecting 46 points on Sunday, as the Under hits 53% of the time. Back the Under at bet365 here:\nLooking for NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Sunday.

    "body": "\nInterest in NFL player props always increases as the importance of games increases as well, and such is the case with the penultimate week of the 2026 NFL playoffs. We've reached the NFL Championship Round with Broncos vs. Patriots (-3.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook) in the AFC title game and Rams vs. Seahawks (-2.5) in the NFC title game. Prop bets for the likes of Drake Maye, Courtland Sutton, Matthew Stafford, Kyren Williams and Sam Darnold will be among the most sought after with NFL picks, but considering overlooked players could find value with your NFL bets.Jarrett Stidham could be one of those as he starts in place of Bo Nix (ankle), and the former has an NFL props total of 0.5 interceptions (-202/+157) for Sunday. Those NFL prop odds for the Under are intriguing considering Denver may heavily lean on the run, and limiting Stidham's pass attempts would, in theory, limit his chances to throw a pick. There are several other plus-money NFL props available in the latest NFL championship round odds. Before locking in any conference championship NFL picks, you'll want to check out the top NFL player props and NFL prop predictions for the AFC and NFC championship games powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 bet wins on props like Stidham under 0.5 interceptions:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Championship Round NFL betting, the Machine Learning Model has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided prop picks for every position. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for the NFC and AFC Championship Games at SportsLine.Top NFL Championship Round QB, RB, WR, TE player prop picksHere's a look at some of the top Championship Round NFL prop picks from SportsLine AI: Quarterback: Sam Darnold, Seahawks: Under 1.5 passing touchdowns (-114)Darnold has gone under his passing touchdowns total in four of his last five games, including having one or fewer touchdown in each of his last three games. Darnold notoriously struggles when pressured, and the Rams have the fourth-best pressure rate in the league as they forced Darnold into a zero-touchdown, four-interception game earlier this year. SportsLine AI has Darnold having 0.7 passing TDs on average in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Darnold to go under 1.5 passing touchdowns at DraftKings:\nRunning back: TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots: Over 9.5 carries (+118)Denver led the NFL with 68 sacks, and the best way to neutralize a ferocious pass rush is by running the ball. Henderson has received double-digit carries in 10 of his last 12 games as he had 50 more rushing attempts than Rhamondre Stevenson in the regular season. The Broncos were just gashed for 183 yards versus Buffalo, which is the most Denver has allowed all season, as Henderson will be involved early and often. He's forecasted to have 12.9 carries in a 4-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Henderson to go over 9.5 carries at DraftKings:\nWide receiver: Puka Nacua, Rams, Over 92.5 receiving yards (-114)Nacua had an even 300 combined receiving yards in the pair of regular-season contests versus Seattle, including a career-high of 225 yards in the last matchup. The wideout has drawn double-digit targets in each of his last seven games, and Seattle owns the No. 3 run defense, compared to the No. 10 pass defense, so attacking the Seahawks through the air will be the preferred option. Nacua is forecasted to have 111 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Nacua to go over 92.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nTight end: AJ Barner, Seahawks, Under 29.5 receiving yards (-114)Seattle is favored on Sunday versus the Rams, and Barner has gone under his receiving yards market in seven of the last 10 games when the Seahawks are favored. He wasn't even targeted last week, despite playing more snaps than any other Seahawks RB, WR or TE, and Barner had just 14 yards the prior week. The Machine Learning Model has Barner finishing with 18.6 receiving yards in a 4.5-star play. See more NFL picks here, and bet Barner to go under 29.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make NFL Championship Round prop betsIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model locked in confident NFL prop picks involving stars like Matthew Stafford, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Davante Adams and more. It's also identified a tight end with a plus-money payout and has over 20 other NFL props rated 4 stars or better. You must see the Machine Learning Model analysis before making any NFL prop bets.Which NFL prop bets should you target for the NFC and AFC Championship Games, and which tight end sails past his total in a plus-money payout?

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots followed back-to-back 4-13 seasons with a 14-3 showing in Mike Vrabel's first year as head coach. They're now one win away from adding to their NFL record with a 12th Super Bowl appearance.No. 2 seed New England can secure a Super Bowl berth for the first time since 2018 when they visit Empower Field to face the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos at 3 p.m. ET in the AFC Championship Game. The winner will compete in Super Bowl LX against the victor of the NFC Championship Game, which has the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks hosting the No. 5 seed Los Angeles Rams at Lumen Field at 6:30 p.m. ET.The Patriots, who went 8-0 on the road during the regular season, played their first two postseason games at home, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 16-3 and Houston Texans 28-16. Denver (14-3) posted its first playoff victory since 2015 last weekend as it avenged last year's wild-card loss by edging the visiting Buffalo Bills 33-30 in overtime. However, the Broncos will have backup Jarrett Stidham under center in place of Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the win against the Bills.Seattle (14-3), which ended the regular season with a seven-game winning streak, kept rolling as it demolished the San Francisco 49ers 41-6 at home in the Divisional Round. The Rams (12-5), who were the last team to defeat the Seahawks (21-19 in Week 11), have been road warriors as they got past the Carolina Panthers 34-31 and Chicago Bears 20-17 in OT.Eight games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Brooklyn Nets (12-31) and Los Angeles Clippers (20-24) at 9 p.m. ET at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, Cal. The Clippers extended their winning streak in the series to four games with a 121-105 victory at Brooklyn earlier this month.The NHL has six games on its slate, one of which has the Pittsburgh Penguins (25-14-11) visiting Rogers Arena to take on the Vancouver Canucks (17-29-5) at 6 p.m. ET. The Penguins, who posted a 5-1 home triumph in their first meeting with Vancouver this season, won the first three contests of their four-game road trip while the Canucks have recorded one victory in their last 13 outings (1-10-2).One of just a handful of college basketball games taking place Sunday is a Big Ten Conference showdown between USC (14-5) and Wisconsin (14-5) at 4 p.m. ET at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisc. The Badgers are riding a five-game winning streak while the Trojans have lost four of six contests, including their last two.The Patriots are 3.5-point favorites against the Broncos in the latest consensus NFL odds, while the Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites against the Rams. The Clippers are 8.5-point favorites against the Nets, the Penguins are -149 favorites on the money line against the Canucks and Wisconsin is a 7.5-point favorite against USC.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Jan. 25. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchPatriots at BroncosTime: 3 p.m. | Location: Denver | TV: CBS | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Broncos +3.5 (-108) | Expert: Marvin Mims Jr. Over 1.5 rushing yards (-119, PropBetGuy)The Broncos will be in unfamiliar territory as Stidham makes his first start since 2023 and just the fifth of his NFL career. It also will be his first playoff start. But Denver went 8-1 at home this campaign and New England quarterback Drake Maye has had issues holding on to the football this postseason, fumbling a total of six times in two games. The SportsLine Projection Model feels Stidham will keep the Broncos close as they cover the spread in 58% of its simulations. SportsLine props expert PropBet Guy (66-41, +1916 on his last 107 NFL player prop picks) thinks Denver head coach Sean Payton will have some tricks up his sleeve and get wideout Marvin Mims Jr. involved in the running game against a Patriots team that allowed opposing receivers to gain 8.9 yards per carry in the regular season.Rams at SeahawksTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Seattle | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Seahawks -2.5 (-106) | Expert: Rams Over 22.5 points (-114, Larry Hartstein)The Rams were favored in their first two postseason games and failed to cover the spread. They're now underdogs against a Seattle team that has posted three consecutive double-digit victories. The SportsLine Projection Model has a lot of confidence in the Seahawks in this matchup as its simulations have them covering 58% of the time. While Seattle has allowed 10 points or fewer in each of its last three games, SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein believes the Rams will be able to break through as they put up 37 at Lumen Field in Week 16 without the services of some key offensive weapons.NBA best bets, where to watchNets at ClippersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 211.5 (-106) | Expert: Clippers -8.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)These teams are among the worst in the NBA offensively as the Nets are last in scoring (108.3 points per game) and the Clippers are 25th (112.3). But Los Angeles has been productive of late, recording at least 112 points in 11 of its last 16 contests, and the Nets have exceeded their average in four of their past six outings. The teams combined for 226 points when they met earlier this month, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees another high-scoring affair as the Over hits in 68% of its simulations. Kawhi Leonard (knee/illness) is questionable for this matchup, but SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+521 on his last 21 spread picks involving Brooklyn) is confident the Clippers will handle the Mets whether he's in the lineup or not.NHL best bets, where to watchPenguins at CanucksTime: 6 p.m. | Location: Vancouver | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Canucks +1.5 (-196) | Expert: Penguins -143 (Thomas Casale)The Penguins haven't had much difficulty on their road trip thus far, as they defeated the Seattle Kraken, Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers by three or more goals. Vancouver is in a major tailspin but has been very competitive of late, sandwiching one-goal losses around the lone victory in its last 13 outings. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Canucks will at least keep this contest close as its simulations have them covering the spread 68% of the time. SportsLine expert Thomas Casale likes the Penguins to finish their four-game trek with a perfect record, especially since they've won six of their last seven away from home.CBB best bets, where to watchUSC at WisconsinTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Madison, Wisc. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 158.5 (-108) | Expert: Wisconsin -7.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)The Badgers (second, 84.3 points per game) and Trojans (fifth, 82.6) are among the top five highest-scoring teams in the Big Ten. However, USC has had trouble on offense of late, registering fewer than 70 points in each of its last two outings. The SportsLine Projection Model has taken that into consideration and its simulations have the Under hitting more than 52% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+257 on his last 51 college basketball ATS picks) feels Wisconsin will make things difficult for the Trojans and cruise to its sixth consecutive victory.\n            ",

L.A. earned a 21-19 win on Nov. 16, before Seattle outlasted the Rams 38-37 in overtime on Dec. 18. The Rams (12-5), who are coming off a 20-17 overtime win over the Bears on Sunday, are 7-4 on the road this season, including the postseason. The Seahawks (14-3), who defeated San Francisco 41-6 on Saturday, are 7-2 at home. Seattle will be without running back Zach Charbonnet (knee) as Cam Akers has been elevated to the main roster. WR Tutu Atwell and TE Nick Vannett are inactive for the Rams.Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET at Lumen Field in Seattle. The Seahawks leads the all-time series 29-28. The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites in the latest Rams vs. Seahawks odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Seattle is at -142 on the money line (risk $142 to win $100), with L.A. at +118 (risk $100 to win $118).

Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams, with just one total touchdown allowed over this stretch. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

Vine and UAE Team Emirates XRG teammate Mikkel Bjerg crashed into one of the animals after it hopped into the peloton. Bjerg and three other cyclists -- Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese -- were knocked out of the race because of the crash. The kangaroo was also injured and visibly struggled to make its way out of the road.Vine exchanged bikes with a teammate and rejoined the peloton multiple kilometers down the road. The incident occurred during a high-speed stretch of an eight-lap circuit outside of Adelaide.\nVine entered Stage 5 with a 1:03 lead over Switzerland's Mauro Schmid and won the tour by that exact margin despite the crash. He lost four of his six teammates throughout the tour because of multiple crashes, including the one with the kangaroos. His team announced that Jhonatan Narváez sustained several stable thoracic vertebrae compression fractures in one of those other accidents.\"Everyone asks me what's the most dangerous thing in Australia and I always tell them it's kangaroos,\" Vine said after the race. \"They wait and they hide in the bushes until you can't stop and they jump out in front of you. Point proven today.\n\"Two of them blasted through the peloton when we were doing probably 50 kph and one of them stopped and went left, right, left right, left right and I ended up hitting its backside.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Patrick Reed accomplished a career first on Sunday when he ran away and hid from the field at the 2026 Dubai Desert Classic. Converting his 54-hole lead into a four-stroke victory at 14 under, the American claimed his first non-co-sanctioned trophy on the DP World Tour.With the win, the Masters champion climbs all the way up to No. 29 in the Official World Golf Rankings, positioning him to qualify to play in all of this season's major championships. Reed plays primarily on LIV Golf, which has yet to be recognized by the OWGR; its most recent application remains under review.\"I think the biggest thing this week that was so special is I've won on every tour except this one,\" Reed said after topping Andy Sullivan. \"Even though, online, it says I have three wins, one was a major and two were WGC events. So they are all co-sanctioned events. It's something that's always kind of been eating at me, sitting there not actually having a win over here. \"And to come to a place where we had a chance in 2023 and allowed that one to kind of slip by, it was very important for me to come out here and play well and to have that opportunity. And to close it off means a lot to me, especially doing it here in Dubai, which I love coming to, makes it even more special.\"\nReed's victory makes headlines for several reasons, as one of the most prolific grinders in the current game continues to squeeze out quality results no matter the tour he plays. The 35-year-old turned in 1 over and remained at that number for his round after exchanging a birdie and a bogey on Nos. 10-11. Righting the ship, Reed played his last seven holes in 1 under to win in ho-hum fashion.After his win, however, Reed revealed that his contract with LIV Golf is not yet in ink for the upcoming 2026 season. LIV Golf begins its season in a couple of weeks in Riyadh, where the league will debut its new 72-hole format. Reed plays on Dustin Johnson's 4 Aces club, which recently acquired Thomas Detry from the PGA Tour and has fellow Belgian Thomas Pieters on the roster.\"We're still finalizing the contract,\" Reed said. \"We're not complete on that yet.\"\n\"At the moment, yes, [I am a free agent],\" Reed continued. \"It's one of those things that I don't like to talk business and stuff while I'm playing, and so it's like Monday through Wednesday is the only time to really talk about it. And so, it's just kind of one of those things that, you know, getting here this week, I knew that once Thursday got here, just focus on golf and golf only. ... The biggest thing for me right now is just go out and play well this week. Obviously, got the win. Then hopefully carry that momentum into next week and hopefully compete late Sunday again.\"Reed noted that he plans to play in LIV Golf Riyadh and would be surprised if he did not. While his short-term schedule appears close to being solidified, his plans and where he may take his talents are not. When asked what potential avenues he could seek, Reed mentioned a return to the PGA Tour by finishing inside the top 10 of the Race to Dubai. As it stands, those who finish inside this mark and are not yet qualified for the PGA Tour earn a full-time card for the following season.\"Continue to play out here and be in the top 10 and be on the PGA Tour next year,\" Reed said. \"Good golf takes care of itself, right? It's always kind of been that way from Day 1. ... If I ended up not playing on LIV this year, obviously it would be one of those things that I would be out here playing more on this tour and trying to secure one of those spots in the top 10 and allow myself to get back on the PGA Tour.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As players were being introduced ahead of Unrivaled action on Sunday, three-time WNBA champion Breanna Stewart held up a sign that said \"Abolish ICE,\" when her name was called. Stewart's action comes in the wake of federal immigration officers killing a 37-year-old man, Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis on Saturday. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking protests across the city, and other across the country, calling for ICE to be abolished.After the game on Sunday, Stewart expanded on her decision to hold up the sign.\"Really all day yesterday, I was just disgusted from everything that you see on Instagram and in the news,\" Stewart said. \"Everyone here [at Unrivaled] is feeling that way, one way or another. We're so fueled by hate right now instead of love, so I wanted to have a simple message of 'Abolish ICE,' which means having policies to uplift families and communities instead of fueling fear and violence.\"Stewart also shared her personal connection to this specific issue, as her wife, Marta Xargay Casademont, is not a U.S. citizen as she's from Spain.\n\"It's scary,\" Stewart said. \"You see it on social media, you see it splitting up families and dissecting communities and kids are being involved. It's the worst in all ways. And to be married to Marta ... we're working to get her citizenship, and she is a legal permanent resident and all of that. But it seems like it doesn't matter. And I think that that's why these policies need to be put in place, that reform needs to happen, because it doesn't seem to be affecting the right people. It's not helping anybody.\"Unrivaled held a moment of silence before Saturday's games, with the public address announcer saying, \"Our thoughts and support are with everyone affected, and we send our deepest sympathies to those who have lost a loved one.\"While Stewart has made the most public statement on ICE and the recent tragedies happening in Minneapolis, she isn't the only member of Unrivaled or the WNBA to share the same sentiments. Minnesota native and 2025 No. 1 overall pick Paige Bueckers pledged to match the $50,000 she won in Unrivaled's free-throw challenge to donate to the Hopkins Strong Relief Fund, which aids with food security in Minnesota.\nWNBPA executive committee member Brianna Turner took to social media to share similar sentiments about ICE.\"My thoughts are constantly with the [Minnesota] residents who are suffering through a politically motivated ICE invasion,\" Turner wrote on social media. \"There is nothing positive about improperly trained federal agents profiling individuals & antagonizing communities. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere.\"WNBA players are no stranger to speaking up on matters like these. In 2020, they were at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement amongst athletes. This has been no different.\n\"I think doing whatever you can to help your community [is important],\" Stewart said. \"Obviously, Minnesota is the place that everyone's seeing is in crisis, but it's happening in many more cities than just one, and knowing the right people to reach out to -- your local council person, your mayor, your governor -- and really advocating to change the policies and advocating for reform, knowing that it's not going to happen overnight.Stewart continued.\"But how many times do we have to see it happen over and over and over again and using our platform to make sure that we're trying to make a change and a difference and hopefully save a life.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Vanderbilt suffered its first loss of the season at the hands of South Carolina on Sunday afternoon, with the No. 2 Gamecocks dominating the No. 5 Commodores, 103-74.Vanderbilt came into the game 20-0, which was the best start in program history, and the Commodores were one of the last two undefeated teams remaining in women's college basketball. The only one still standing is No. 1 UConn, the reigning national champions.\"We have won 20 games,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph told reporters postgame. \"We're 20-1. The world is not ending. We are going to be fine.\"\nFive Gamecocks scored in double figures, led by Ta'Niya Latson and Tessa Johnson, who combined for 41 points. Mikayla Blakes led Vanderbilt's effort with 23 points, which marked her 16th 20+ point game of the season.\nSouth Carolina was bouncing back from a 94-82 overtime loss to Oklahoma earlier in the week. Dawn Staley's program has not lost back-to-back games since the 2018-19 season and Sunday's result helped the Gamecocks keep that streak going. They moved the ball well with 25 assists, more than double the 12 they had in the loss to the Sooners. The Gamecocks were able to speed up Vanderbilt, which helped them get 24 points off 16 turnovers in the first half. This put the Commodores in an unusual situation since they entered the game only averaging 12.5 turnovers per game. Vanderbilt finished the game with 20 turnovers that led to 32 South Carolina points.\nSouth Carolina held a 55-44 lead at the break, with 28 of those points coming from the paint. By the end of the night, the Gamecocks had won the battle in the paint 56-24. However, their shots were also working from elsewhere as they had 10 3-pointers, which is more than their 5.9 per game average this season.\nRalph said she was surprised by her team's poor defensive performance, which she described as an \"absolute disaster.\" Mental strength and staying locked in even when they are down is also something the coach wants to see from her team as they move forward.\"At points in the game it looked like we quit,\" she said. \"That can't be who we are.\"This was the Gamecocks' 5th win against a ranked opponent this season, while Vanderbilt has two. Both teams still have plenty of time to add more quality wins before March because the SEC is impressively deep with nine teams ranked in the AP Top 25 this week.\nUp next, South Carolina will hit the road to take on Auburn on Thursday. That same night, Vanderbilt will have a chance to bounce back with a road matchup against No. 18 Ole Miss.\n            ",

The second-year quarterback is expected to be sidelined 12 weeks after undergoing a procedure last week on his broken right ankle, which he injured in the divisional round, according to ESPN, Nix will watch the conference championship game from a luxury suite and is instructed to refrain from putting weight on his injured ankle for at least four weeks. He will not return to football activities for three months, and while that layoff will cost him a significant portion of the offseason, the expectation is that he will be mostly recovered in time to join the Broncos for OTAs and training camp.Doctors reportedly informed Nix that he should not have any long-term concerns about his ankle despite having suffered two previous breaks.The latest ankle fracture occurred on the penultimate play of overtime in last week's 33-30 win over the Buffalo Bills, Broncos coach Sean Payton said. Because he continued to play and showed no ill effects, it was unclear to the public until after the game that Nix sustained an injury at all.\n\"What started as one of the most exciting games I've ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I've ever received,\" Nix said after he underwent surgery. \"This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it.\"With Nix ruled out for the year, backup Jarrett Stidham rises to the starting lineup and assumes his largest role since the 2023 season. Stidham has just four career starts under his belt and is a journeyman backup set to face the team who selected him at No. 133 overall in the 2019 NFL Draft. The former Patriot is on his third team after a stint with the Las Vegas Raiders and will suddenly be thrust into a high-leverage spot with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. He is 1-3 as a starter and has yet to appear in a postseason game.\nNix publicly backed Stidham ahead of the AFC Championship game and said he \"couldn't be more confident in Jarrett.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The bad weather in Denver appeared to have thrown off a key field goal attempt for the Broncos on Sunday, and it might have cost them the game.During New England's 10-7 win, Broncos kicker Wil Lutz missed two field goals, with the most critical coming in the fourth quarter. With just under five minutes left to play, the Broncos were facing a fourth-and-5 from New England's 28-yard line, so Sean Payton sent Lutz out for a 45-yard attempt.The kick missed after it was blocked by New England's Leonard Taylor. According to Lutz, Broncos holder Jeremy Crawshaw may have lined up a yard closer to the line of scrimmage than he should have.\"Unfortunately, you couldn't see the lines on the field and honestly, I think we were … we might have been a yard short on the snap,\" Lutz said via Denver Sports. \"Can't see the lines on the field and we had to kind of estimate, and a guy comes through, and it was blocked.\"With the snow making it difficult to see, Crawshaw essentially had to estimate his spot, and he ended up a yard off.\nAs you can see above, Taylor was only able to get his fingertips on the ball, so if Crawshaw had lined up another yard back, Lutz's kick likely would have had enough height to clear Taylor's hand. In the NFL, the holder is usually lined up about eight yards behind the line of scrimmage, but Crawshaw was only seven yards back.Lutz missed two field goals on what was a disastrous day for kickers. New England's Andy Borregales also missed two attempts. The four combined misses were the most in a conference title game since 1983, when San Francisco and Washington combined to miss six kicks in the NFC Championship.Besides the 45-yarder, Lutz also missed a 54-yard attempt in the first half before the weather turned. He was reliable for the Broncos this year, hitting 28 of 32 field goals, but he has a history of struggling in the playoffs. Over his career, Lutz has made just 68.2% of his postseason field goal attempts (15 of 22).\nIf the fourth-quarter kick hadn't been blocked, there's a good chance the game would have gone to overtime, because neither team moved the ball much in the second half. And if it had reached overtime, every field goal attempt would have been an adventure in those conditions. Instead, Lutz's kick was denied, and the Patriots are now headed to the Super Bowl for the 12th time in franchise history.\n            ",

There were plenty of surprises in this matchup, whether it was the 17 total points scored or how the weather went from beautiful to a nightmarish blizzard in the second half. It was actually a surprise that secured the game for the Patriots, as quarterback Drake Maye went rogue on a third-and-5 to move the chains and run out the clock late in the fourth quarter. According to The Boston Herald, Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels called an outside zone run for Rhamondre Stevenson on third down with 1:57 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Patriots held a three-point lead, and their defense was playing well -- holding Denver scoreless since the first quarter. Instead of handing the ball to Stevenson, Maye kept it and ran out to the left -- beating the Broncos defense for a first down. \"I hit my block, and all the defenders started running the other way,\" Patriots center Garrett Bradbury said. \"I'm like, 'What? Oh my God.'\"\nMaye told his teammates after the game that he debated telling them he was going to keep the ball. He decided against it. \n\"After the game, Drake's like, 'I debated telling you guys if I was gonna (keep) it or not. But I just decided not to,\" Bradbury said.Maye completed 10 of 21 passes for 86 yards on Sunday, becoming just the second quarterback since 1990 to win a conference championship game while throwing for under 100 yards, the other being Jimmy Garoppolo in 2019. However, Maye made an impact with his legs, rushing 10 times for 65 yards and the Patriots' lone touchdown of the game.\nThanks to Maye's gamble, the Patriots find themselves in the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The matchup is set. It'll be the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots duking it out for the right to lift the Lombardi Trophy and call themselves Super Bowl LX champions. These clubs find themselves en route to Santa Clara for the big game after eking out wins on Championship Sunday, albeit in different fashions. Seattle had to throw its way to a Super Bowl appearance as Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship. Meanwhile, New England churned out a 10-7 win during a snowy AFC Championship against the Denver Broncos at Mile High. The Patriots leaned on defense and Drake Maye's rushing ability to punch their ticket. While these are widely different versions of these clubs, this is a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX back during the 2014 season. That game is remembered most for Malcolm Butler's infamous goal-line interception to give Tom Brady and the Patriots their then-fourth Super Bowl title in franchise history, and spoil Russell Wilson and the Seahawks bid at back-to-back championships. That's the history. But what does the future have in store for us in this upcoming Super Bowl? What do the oddsmakers think of this matchup? Below, we'll comb over the initial lines for Super Bowl LX and also highlight some of the notable favorites for Super Bowl MVP. NFL odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.\nGameEarly LineEarly TotalEarly MoneylineSeahawks vs. PatriotsSeahawks -4.546.5Seahawks -230, Patriots +190While Lumen Field and Gillette Stadium are two of the better home-field advantages that the NFL has to offer, both Seattle and New England were superb on the road this season, which could help them on this neutral site at Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl LX. With their win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship, New England became the first team in NFL history to go 9-0 on the road. Mike Vrabel's team was also 7-2 ATS in those nine road matchups. As for Seattle, they did not go undefeated on the road like the Patriots, but were an equally impressive 8-1 on the road. They also come into this Super Bowl with an NFL-best 8-1 ATS road record. \nPlayerSuper Bowl MVP oddsSam Darnold+130Drake Maye+235Jaxon Smith-Njigba+550Kenneth Walker III+600Rhamondre Stevenson+2500Rashid Shaheed+2800Marcus Jones+5500Stefon Diggs+6000Naturally, both quarterbacks are going to be No. 1 and No. 2 in the odds to win Super Bowl MVP. With the Seahawks favored, it makes sense to see Darnold as the odds-on favorite for the award. Seven of the last 10 Super Bowl MVPs were quarterbacks. Two of the remaining three were wide receivers (Cooper Kupp in Super Bowl LVI and Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII), while Von Miller (Super Bowl 50) was the other non-QB MVP and lone defensive player to earn the distinction over the last decade. \nInterestingly, both Kenneth Walker III and Rhamondre Stevenson have favorable odds out of the gate. If either of them is named Super Bowl MVP, they'd become the first running back to earn the award since Terrell Davis after Super Bowl XXXII. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos' season ended just short of reaching Super Bowl LX after falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. This was the latest gut punch for a franchise that limped into this conference title matchup. The high of winning a divisional round thriller against the Buffalo Bills in overtime was almost instantly shattered once word got out that Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury. That thrust backup Jarrett Stidham into the limelight, and while the veteran had his moments, he couldn't get his team to pull off what would've been a miraculous upset. Now, Sean Payton's club is looking into the abyss of the offseason and on the precipice of doing a postmortem of the 2025 season. By most accounts, it was a wildly successful campaign, owning a 14-3 record over the regular season, which was good enough for an NFC West title and the No. 1 seed. As they look to begin preparing for the 2026 season, let's highlight what's on the horizon for the organization. Bo Nix's recovery takes center stage\nNix suffered a broken right ankle in the final moments of that overtime win against the Bills. The second-year quarterback has already undergone surgery to repair the ankle, with the procedure done this week. The early prognosis was that Nix is expected to be sidelined for 12 weeks. If he stays on that recovery timeline, Nix should only miss a small amount of OTAs (if any) and certainly be on track to participate during mandatory minicamp later this spring. That gives Nix plenty of time to get into form before Denver opens up training camp, so this injury is not debilitating enough that it'll bleed into 2026. Does the coaching staff lose key figures?Payton has been able to bring the Broncos back to relevance, but that success may soon result in key figures on his coaching staff being poached. With Denver now eliminated, teams looking for a head coach can now hold in-person interviews with Broncos staffers, including defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and offensive pass game coordinator Davis Webb. Both Joseph and Webb have been popular candidates this hiring cycle, and it would not be shocking to see one or both coaches depart in short order. \nWebb has interest from the Las Vegas Raiders and Buffalo Bills, and neither of those destinations has filled their vacancy to this point. Webb also interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, but the franchise recently hired former Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. While Payton calls the offensive plays, having someone of Webb's acumen departing is hardly ideal for a still-developing offense under Nix. As for Joseph, he has been requested by a large contingent of teams. While some of those organizations have since filled their roles, the Raiders and Arizona Cardinals are two clubs that have expressed interest in Joseph and are still on the hunt for a new coach. Joseph's potential exit could prove to be the biggest X factor of Denver's offseason. A big piece as to why the Broncos made it to the AFC Championship was due to Joseph orchestrating arguably the best defense in the NFL. Denver was fourth in the NFL in scoring and first in the NFL in sacks (including postseason). If Joseph leaves, there's the risk that the unit takes a slight step back. \nBolstering offense around NixA couple of the areas the Broncos should look to address this offseason come on the offensive side of the ball. Specifically, they need to continue surrounding Nix with talent at the skill positions. This season, the Broncos ranked 28th in the NFL in yards per reception from the wide receiver and tight end positions combined. Courtland Sutton was able to lead the team with 1,017 yards receiving, but Denver did struggle to find a top secondary pass-catching option, volleying from Troy Franklin to Pat Bryant to Marvin Mims at receiver. They also never truly got Evan Engram off the ground as Payton's \"Joker\" at the tight end spot. \nMoreover, Denver need to bolster the backfield. The rushing attack cratered after J.K. Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10. Rookie RJ Harvey averaged just 3.7 yards per carry on the year. Their inability to run the football effectively came back to bite them in the AFC Championship, where they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush as a team. With a backup quarterback under center and snowy conditions late in the contest, a capable ground attack could've helped them pull off the upset. Instead, that deficiency helped be their undoing. With Dobbins looking at free agency this offseason, along with a shaky injury history, Denver would be wise to add a back in some capacity this offseason. Offseason assets, free agentsNotable free agents:DL John Franklin-MyersLB Alex SingletonRB J.K. DobbinsS P.J. LockeJa'Quan McMillan (restricted)The Broncos are projected to have roughly $35.4 million in available salary cap space, which is the 12th highest in the NFL.  As for the NFL Draft, Denver has five picks inside the first four rounds, including their own first-round pick.\n            ",

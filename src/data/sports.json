    "body": "\nThe final chance to make an NFL SGP on 'Monday Night Football' in the regular season comes in Week 17 as the Atlanta Falcons host the Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford leads the NFL in passing touchdowns, Bijan Robinson tops in scrimmage yards, and Puka Nacua is the league leader in receptions, which makes all of them attracting for NFL player props and a 'MNF' SGP. L.A. is a 7.5-point road favorite, per the latest NFL odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, and it has the league's best spread record, so Rams vs. Falcons picks ATS could also find their way into your parlay.Both teams have heavily leaned towards the Over recently, as it is 7-1 combined over their last four games. Thus, you have plenty of NFL bets to consider for your 'Monday Night Football' same-game parlay. Before locking in any Falcons vs. Rams picks for your 'Monday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the Rams vs. Falcons prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins to bet on props like Bijan Robinson (-130) as an anytime touchdown scorer:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Falcons vs. Rams on 'Monday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of 6-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Los Angeles vs. Atlanta here.Top Monday Night Football SGP picksAfter simulating Rams vs. Falcons, SportsLine AI says Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins to go Under 226.5 passing yards (-112). The veteran has started six games and gone under his passing yards prop in four of those. This is Cousins' 11th season with at least six starts under his belt, and it's arguably his worst season with that amount of playing time. His passer rating, completion percentage, yards per attempt and touchdown percentage are all the lowest of those 11 seasons.The Rams also won't make it easy for Cousins to rack up yardage through the air as they have a ferocious pass rush which has the fourth-most pressures in the NFL. Just seven teams have allowed a lower passer rating than L.A., and after the Rams gave up a season-high of 6.8 yards per carry in their last game versus Seattle, the ground game should be Atlanta's preferred option. Cousins is projected to have 180.4 yards carries on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here.Bet Cousins to go Under 226.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make Falcons vs. Rams SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has nine other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your Rams vs. Falcons SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Falcons vs. Rams predictions?

Chicago is plus-21 in that regard, while the second-place team is at just plus-15. Chicago has forced the most turnovers (31) and it has committed the second-fewest (10). When the Niners lose the turnover battle this season, they are just 3-4 against the spread, and San Francisco's defense has the fewest sacks in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the 49ers can coverRiding a five-game win streak, San Francisco leads the NFL in points per game, points per drive and 3rd-down offense during this run, and each of the five victories have come by double-digits. The offense has been unstoppable over the last two games in particular, as the Niners are just the fifth team in the last 75 years to go back-to-back outings without punting the ball, and now it gets to face the No. 27 run defense. Though he doesn't qualify for statistical leaderboards due to time missed, Brock Purdy leads the NFL in QBR and is among the top five in touchdown percentage, completion percentage and passer rating. Additionally, the 49ers are 4-0 both straight up and ATS on primetime in 2025. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bears vs. 49ers  picksSportsLine's model has simulated Niners vs. Bears  10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl season has already seen 24 games completed, in addition to four playoff matchups. But some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are over a dozen matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 14-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday. The spread dropped one point after the announcement that Kyle Whittingham would depart for Michigan before this game. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Vanderbilt (-4.5) vs. Iowa, USC vs. TCU (+6.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5), Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5) and Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest (+3). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Texas State (-13.5) handles Rice in the Armed Forces Bowl at 1 p.m. ET on Jan. 2 in a matchup of Lone Star State foes. The Bobcats bounced back from a five-game losing streak to win their last three on the way to claim bowl eligibility. Rice, meanwhile, went 5-7 and only got eligibility because there weren't enough .500 teams. The Owls lost six of their final eight games. SportsLine's model projects that Texas State wins 75% of the time, making the Bobcats the clear side to back in confidence pools. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are several teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as plenty of underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        The calendar is about to flip to 2026 and there is still so much that has to happen between now and Opening Day. Five of the top six free agents remain unsigned (plus many others) and there are so many trade candidates who could move. Here now are Monday's hot stove rumors and happenings.Tigers 'lukewarm' on Bregman\nAlthough the Tigers have interest in free agent third baseman Alex Bregman, it is \"lukewarm\" at best, reports the Detroit Free Press. The club hasn't budged much during negotiations. Detroit reportedly offered Bregman a six-year deal in the $170 million range last offseason, but he obviously picked the Red Sox. Bregman and Tigers manager A.J. Hinch know each other well from their Astros days.It has been a fairly quiet offseason for the Tigers, who signed veteran closer Kenley Jansen and journeyman Drew Anderson to short-term deals. They also re-signed setup man Kyle Finnegan. Colt Keith is currently in line to get most of the playing time at third base, though Detroit's roster flexible enough to add Bregman and still get Keith plenty of at-bats at other positions.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Red Sox pursuing infieldersThe Red Sox continue to pursue another bat for the infield even after trading for Willson Contreras, according to the Boston Globe. Among their targets are Cardinals super utility man Brendan Donovan, Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte, Astros third baseman Isaac Paredes, and free agents Bo Bichette and Alex Bregman. Bregman spent 2025 with Boston.\nThe BoSox and Rockies are the only teams to not sign a major-league free agent this offseason, though Boston has made significant trades to get Contreras, Sonny Gray, and Johan Oviedo. They currently have a combination of Romy Gonzalez, Marcelo Mayer, and Nick Sogard in line to play second and third bases, so yeah, there's room for another addition on the infield.Orioles bring back Eflin\nThe O's have re-signed veteran right-hander Zach Eflin to a one-year deal with a mutual option, the team announced late Sunday. Eflin gets a $3 million signing bonus with a $5 million salary in 2026, plus a $2 million buyout on a mutual option for 2027, reports FanSided. That adds up to $10 million guaranteed. There's another $4 million in bonuses tied to games started.Back trouble and a lat strain limited Eflin, 31, to 14 mostly ineffective starts in 2025. He was a rock solid mid-rotation starter from 2023-24, however, one with a knack for limiting walks and hard contact. Nabbing him for one year and $10 million guaranteed is a nice roll of the dice for an O's team that could still use another starter, but is much improved this offseason.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Angels, Padres, Pirates in on OkamotoAmong the teams interested in Japanese first baseman Kazuma Okamoto are the Angels, Padres, and Pirates, reports BeisbolFR. Okamoto's 45-day posting window closes at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Jan. 4. There is some thought he is more likely to hit right away in the big leagues than Munetaka Murakami, who signed a two-year deal worth $34 million with the White Sox last week.We ranked Okamoto, 29, as the 22nd-best free agent available this offseason. He's spent his entire career with the Yomiuri Giants and hit .322/.411/.581 with 15 home runs in 77 games around an injury to his non-throwing elbow in 2025. Okamoto has played third base most of his career, though he's seen more action at first in recent years, and is expected to stay there long-term.Heaney retires\nVeteran left-hander Andrew Heaney announced his retirement on social media over the weekend. \"I will miss the game greatly, but all of my experiences and the lasting relationships have made me a better person,\" Heaney wrote. Now 34, Heaney went 56-72 with a 4.57 ERA in parts of 12 MLB seasons. He started and won Game 4 of the 2023 World Series with the Rangers and also appeared in one regular-season game with the 2025 World Series champion Dodgers.\n            ",

It led to a confrontation where teammates held him back. Barmore exchanged words with Jets right tackle Armand Membou, who he says intentionally fell on his body after the whistle. \"What happened was sorry ass No. 70 do dirty-ass (expletive) behind my back,\" Barmore told The Boston Herald. \"People want to talk (expletive), but he ain't out there on this field. I'm just saying, bro. They want to act tough, you go in the locker room. … The play was already over. I heard the whistle blown. Bro came behind me and literally landed his whole body on my back.\"Video replay of the incident showed Membou falling on top of Barmore behind the line of scrimmage, well beyond what resulted in a 12-yard gain from Isaiah Davis on a third-and-long draw play to end the half.\nBarmore appeared to try and push coach Mike Vrabel away from him. Referees did not throw any flags on the play.\n\"I was just reminding everybody to keep their composure,\" Vrabel said. \"We have an identity we've shown, and that we've put out there on the football field, and to make great decisions for the football team. We don't want to give people free yards. That was it. Just a reminder.\"Barmore said Vrabel told him to \"keep my head in the game\" and acknowledged his instruction was beneficial.\"We got to keep calm for the team,\" Barmore said. \"We already knew what they were doing, so we had to keep cool for the team. We got the win. Look at the scoreboard. I'm proud of my team, proud of us, proud of the D-line. We're just going to keep getting better.\"\nMembou, the seventh overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, has been one of New York's most dependable starters as a rookie. Asked about the play with Barmore after the game, Membou said he was not interested in \"going into any details about that\" before moving on to the next question.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Anthony Davis trade market seemed fairly quiet in the immediate aftermath of Nico Harrison's firing. A strong December seems to have awakened some suitors. In the nine games he completed this month, Davis has averaged over 23 points and nearly 13 rebounds while providing his standard defensive excellence and helping the Mavericks creep their way back into the Western Conference Play-In Tournament picture.A number of teams, including the Golden State Warriors, have reportedly considered runs at Davis, but the Atlanta Hawks, according to Marc Stein, \"do appear to be the most determined suitor for Davis at this juncture.\" There's a pretty straightforward path to a trade available if Atlanta wants to pursue it. The Hawks can do a good chunk of the necessary salary-matching with the expiring contract of Kristaps Porziņģis. They have a recent No. 1 overall pick in Zaccharie Risacher who, according to Stein, they are open to dealing in the right package. Their draft debt to the San Antonio Spurs -- accumulated in the Dejounte Murray trade -- is far less daunting now than it looked in the moment. Aside from their seemingly untouchable first-round pick from the Pelicans this June, the Hawks should also have a mid-first round pick thanks to the swap rights they acquired from the Cleveland Cavaliers in last year's De'Andre Hunter deal. They owe San Antonio their first-round pick next year, but have a better pick incoming thanks from their follow up Murray trade with New Orleans. The Hawks will receive the lesser of the Pelicans' and Bucks' first-round picks in 2027, provided they don't both land in the top four. After 2027, the Hawks control all of their own first-round picks. They are free and clear to trade draft capital if they want to, and based on Stein's reporting, they are seemingly smitten enough with Davis to consider it.But there's another obstacle in play here: money. Davis is owed quite a bit of it, over $58 million for next season, before you even factor in a possible extension. Reporting has indicated that Trae Young would not be in a possible Davis deal, meaning his $49 million player option has to be considered in any possible 2026-27 salary planning. Together, that's around $107 million. The Hawks owe another $85 million or so to core players Jalen Johnson, Dyson Daniels, Onyeka Okongwu and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Throw in that first-round pick from New Orleans, and the Hawks are already flirting with $200 million in payroll committed to seven players.\nThis is notable since the projected luxury tax level for next season is just a hair below $202 million. The Hawks haven't paid the luxury tax since 2011 -- before both this ownership group and the original, punitive tax changes that came in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement much less the harsher ones that followed in the 2023 edition. Unite those six players and a high first-round pick and the Hawks would be a tax lock and would likely have to veer into apron territory to build the depth necessary to contend for a championship. Maybe this ownership group would be willing to pay the tax for this group. We just don't have immediate evidence that they would.Stein's reporting acknowledges that reality while hinting at a possible solution: trading Young before he can exercise that option this summer. \"There is a growing belief leaguewide that the Hawks are more open to trading him away than they've ever been,\" Stein wrote. Of course, this raises the issue we've been covering all season with players like Ja Morant and LaMelo Ball: there is seemingly less of an appetite around the league than there has ever been to trade considerable assets for defensively deficient guards who don't consistently make their 3s.Young has missed most of this season due to injury. He's been disappointing when he's played, posting some of the worst shooting numbers of his career while generating less value as a playmaker as the Hawks have handed more of his on-ball responsibility to his younger teammates. Atlanta wants Davis because of how well it played without Young. With him, the Hawks are 2-8 so far this season. The question here is, if the Hawks don't want to pay Young, why would anyone else?\nYou're looking for a very specific sort of team. The concept the Hawks would seemingly be moving toward by bringing in Davis and sending Young out would be to lean fully into size and defense. That's become an increasingly popular model, while the heliocentric, pick-and-roll offenses of the past decade are starting to fall out of fashion. Such players can still have their place, but as floor-raisers more than ceiling-raisers. Young's deficiencies as a defender and off-ball offensive player are so glaring that teams trying to win a championship probably don't want him. But teams trying to win 40 or 45 games? Well, that's his speciality. The Hawks are on a five-year run in which they've won no fewer than 36 games and no more than 43 (or, if you adjust the 2020-21 season to an 82-game pace, 47). So the goal here would be to find a team that, for one reason or another, wants to be in that range and has expiring salaries to send Atlanta in order to accommodate its new, Davis-centric payroll.The Clippers make a lot of sense in this respect. They have the expiring contracts in John Collins, Bogdan Bogdanović and Brook Lopez. They also have a desperate need to maintain some veneer of respectability. They're on track to hand the Thunder a high lottery pick this year, and they owe out their next three first-round picks to Oklahoma City and Philadelphia. This is a team that wants to be a recruiting power. Handing rivals future stars isn't the way to do that. Young could be a bridge. Pair him with Ivica Zubac and a bunch of defense-first wings and the Clippers could be competitive for a few years while they wait out the draft picks they owe and plan for their real future.The Kings can usually be relied upon to do something reckless, and consistent play-in berths would represent meaningful improvement for them. They've already been linked to Morant. Perhaps they'd view Young as a suitable De'Aaron Fox replacement a year after their ill-fated Zach LaVine trade. They don't have expiring contracts, but there are ways of rectifying that. The easiest would involve them trading Domantas Sabonis elsewhere and ensuring that only expiring money comes back to them, which they could then flip for Young.\nIt's not an exciting pool of suitors, but that's where the point guard market is today. In truth, the proper basketball decision -- at least in the short-term -- would probably be to keep Young alongside Davis early on. They're easy fits as a high-end pick-and-roll guard and one of the best lob threats in NBA history. Perhaps playing together raises Young's stock enough to compel him to opt out this summer. Worst-case scenario, it's only one more year on his contract. Nobody is asking the Hawks to pay the repeater penalty. Keep the team together for a year-and-a-half. Pay one big tax bill. Re-assess things from there.Some teams are more comfortable wading into those financial waters than others. This Hawks ownership group has never paid the tax, but it's never had a roster worthy of doing so either. Maybe a version of these Hawks with Young and Davis is good enough to justify it. Or maybe the entire concept of acquiring Davis is about reorienting the roster away from Young, leaning fully into all of that size and defense and athleticism they've accumulated even if it means sacrificing on offense. Stein's reporting here seems to hint that that's the idea. Why else would you be linked to one All-Star while simultaneously be open to moving another. This seems less like an all-in push than a deck shuffling. Davis is certainly gettable for the Hawks. The question here is whether they'll be able to make the money work around him, either by ponying up for Young or by trading him to keep the rest of the roster intact.\n            ",

The Falcons are playing out the string of their season for draft positioning, but they have a chance to throw a wrench into the Rams' plans by coming away with another win here.Los Angeles is coming off a wild, come-from-ahead loss to the division rival Seahawks last week, having undermined its own chances to land the No. 1 seed in the NFC. The Rams piled up 581 yards of offense and didn't turn the ball over, but their defense let up down the stretch despite having forced three turnovers early on.Will the Rams bounce back from their loss a week ago, or will the Falcons make it three straight victories? We'll find out soon enough. Before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Falcons vs. RamsDate: Monday, Dec. 29 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -7, O/U 49.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesL.A.'s playoff hopes. The Rams can no longer win the NFC West thanks to the Seahawks' and 49ers' wins on Sunday. The winner of the Seattle-San Francisco game next week is now going to be the top seed in the conference. That means L.A. is playing to maintain its position and climb as high as the No. 5 seed in the NFC and retain the right to go on the road and play against the NFC South champion, rather than having to go play against the Chicago Bears or Philadelphia Eagles in the first round. If the Rams win this week and next, they'll be the 5-seed regardless of what happens elsewhere.Matthew Stafford's MVP chase. Despite Drake Maye's five-touchdown game against the Jets on Sunday, Stafford remains the heavy favorite to win the Most Valuable Player trophy. According to DraftKings, Stafford is a -225 favorite, giving him an implied 69.2% probability to win. But that can obviously change very quickly if he doesn't put up a representative performance against the Falcons on Monday night. Stafford still leads the league in touchdown passes with 40 and has thrown only five interceptions while passing for over 4,100 yards, but it'll be interesting to see how the voters feel about handing the award to a player whose team might get a wild card slot rather than winning its own division -- especially if he doesn't finish the season with a bang. He has an opportunity to do the latter here, though.Kirk Cousins trying to extend his career. Cousins' first few appearances of this season did not inspire much confidence that he could land another job if and when the Falcons decide to cut ties with him due to his monster cap hit for next season. But he's done better over the past couple of weeks (512 of 79 for 570 yards, five touchdowns and an interception) and if he keeps it going against the Rams and Saints this week and next, maybe he could play himself into being a bridge quarterback option for somebody next offseason.Prediction\nAtlanta has won back-to-back games after dropping seven of eight ... but those games came against the Buccaneers and Cardinals. The Rams, to put it plainly, are not the Bucs and Cardinals. Even without Davante Adams, I expect them to be able to move the ball with relative ease against a Falcons defense that has regressed badly since the beginning of the season. The Rams rank 10th in the NFL in yards allowed per carry and should be able to contain Bijan Robinson from going completely ballistic, and if they can get pressure on Kirk Cousins, I just don't see a way that Atlanta can keep up. Prediction: Rams 26, Falcons 17\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

That will be the 272nd and final game of the 2025 season and the winner will clinch the AFC North title along with the final playoff spot in the AFC. The Steelers and Ravens met back in Week 14 with Pittsburgh topping Baltimore, 27-22. The biggest game of the weekend will arguably be happening on Saturday with the Seahawks hitting the road to face the 49ers in a massive NFC West showdown. There will be a lot on the line in that game with the winner taking home the NFC West title and the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. That means the winner will get a bye in the opening round of the playoffs while the loser will be forced to hit the road for the wild card round.In the early game on Saturday, the Buccaneers will be hosting the Panthers in a game that will likely decide the NFC South. If the Falcons lose to the Rams on Monday night, then the Panthers-Buccaneers game will be a winner-take-all battle for the division title (The Panthers could lose to the Bucs and still win the division title if the Falcons win their final two games). The No. 1 seed in the AFC will be decided on Sunday. The Broncos will be hosting the Chargers at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and if they win that game, they'll clinch the top seed. However, if the Broncos lose, the Patriots could sneak in and steal the top seed by beating the Dolphins. With that in mind, let's check out the full Week 18 schedule: \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSaturday, Jan. 3\nPanthers at Buccaneers, 4:30 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)Seahawks at 49ers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)Sunday, Jan. 4Packers at Vikings, 1 p.m. ET (CBS)Browns at Bengals, 1 p.m. ET (CBS)Colts at Texans, 1 p.m. ET (CBS)Cowboys at Giants, 1 p.m. ET (Fox)Saints at Falcons, 1 p.m. ET (Fox)Titans at Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (Fox)Chargers at Broncos, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Chiefs at Raiders, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Commanders at Eagles, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Jets at Bills, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS)Dolphins at Patriots, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox)Lions at Bears 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox)Cardinals at Rams, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox)Ravens at Steelers, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nGood morning, everyone! Carter Bahns here. I hope you all had a fantastic holiday weekend and are ready to put a bow on 2025. A few NFL teams already have their sights set on 2026 after falling out of playoff contention in Week 17, and if your favorite team is part of that group, I extend my sympathies. As we enter the final week of the year, we'll take a look at the NFL playoff picture, analyze Michigan's coaching hire and cover all the other important notes from the post-Christmas sports slate. Here we go.  🏈 Five things to know Monday The NFL postseason picture took shape in Week 17. All but two playoff spots are locked up after the penultimate week of the regular season. One berth remains up for grabs in the AFC and NFC apiece, and it is quite possible that the Steelers let one slip away on Sunday with their upset loss to the Browns. Both No. 1 seeds will be up for grabs next weekend, as will the NFC South and AFC North crowns. Take a look at the full playoff picture ahead of Monday's Rams-Falcons game with Los Angeles trying to improve its playoff position.Michigan announced Kyle Whittingham as its next football coach. Less than a month after stepping down from his post as the longtime coach at Utah, Whittingham accepted the Michigan job as the replacement for Sherrone Moore. At 66, he may not be a long-term solution for the Wolverines, but he is among the most highly regarded coaches in college football and should deliver a much-needed culture overhaul to a program that has been marred by scandals this decade. Among Whittingham's first tasks at Michigan is to keep quarterback Bryce Underwood on board.Maxx Crosby will evaluate his future with the Raiders after being shut down for the season. The Raiders placed Crosby on season-ending injured reserve due to a knee issue he sustained earlier in the year, and he reportedly did not take kindly to the decision. The five-time Pro Bowl defensive end \"vehemently\" disagreed with the move and, after undergoing a minor procedure on his meniscus, will contemplate whether to remain in Las Vegas or seek a move elsewhere. If Crosby demands a trade, the Cowboys, Ravens, Chargers and Bengals figure to be among the defense-needy teams who could be in his market.Austin Reaves will reportedly miss at least four weeks with a calf strain. The NBA's calf injury epidemic took another victim. The Lakers' second-leading scorer suffered a grade 2 strain in the Christmas Day loss to the Rockets, and his absence could spell serious trouble for a team that is already on a three-game losing streak. Reaves is in the middle of a career year and averages 26.6 points, 6.3 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game.Ranked teams went 4-1 in bowl games over the weekend. And the only loss came in a battle between two top 25 squads. No. 21 Houston took down LSU in the Texas Bowl, No. 19 Virginia defeated Missouri in the Gator Bowl, No. 25 North Texas squeaked past San Diego State in the New Mexico Bowl and No. 12 BYU pulled off a comeback win over No. 22 Georgia Tech in the Pop-Tarts Bowl. Meanwhile, Clemson lost to Penn State in a Pinstripe Bowl matchup that featured two downtrodden preseason national championship hopefuls, and the Tigers' defeat added more uncertainty to an already bleak long-term outlook for Dabo Swinney. 📊 Do not miss this: Where Kyle Whittingham, new hires rank among Big Ten coaches \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The caliber of coaching in the Big Ten got even stronger with the latest batch of moves on the carousel, which saw four programs undergo staff turnover. Whittingham's arrival at Michigan gave the Wolverines an apparent immediate upgrade, and while the same cannot be said with absolute certainty for Penn State, Michigan State and UCLA, each of those teams made exciting moves that could quickly prove beneficial. \nChip Patterson ranked the 18 coaches in the Big Ten after the recent hires, and two of the newcomers stand in the upper half of the conference. Kyle Whittingham, Michigan: No. 4Matt Campbell, Penn State: No. 8Pat Fitzgerald, Michigan State: No. 11Bob Chesney, UCLA: No. 16From Ryan Day to Mike Locksley, you can see the rest of Patterson's Big Ten coach rankings here.  🏈 NFL Week 17 takeaways include Seahawks' dominance, Steelers' missed opportunity \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The penultimate week of the NFL regular season saw numerous teams lock up playoff berths and division titles. But some of the squads that learned their postseason fate are disappointed with the result. Here's everything you need to know from Week 17: \nWinners: A sixth consecutive win for the Seahawks (27-10 over the Panthers) kept the NFC's No. 1 seed in play. They control their own destiny and would lock up the first-round bye if they defeat the 49ers next week. On an individual level, Drake Maye is a winner this week after throwing five touchdown passes in the rout of the Jets. The Patriots quarterback is squarely in the MVP race and trails only Matthew Stafford, according to DraftKings oddsmakers.Losers: The Steelers squandered a golden opportunity to win the AFC North with a 13-6 upset loss to the lowly Browns, and they must now get past the Ravens in a winner-take-all Week 18 showdown. The Packers made the wrong kind of history in their 41-24 loss to the Ravens, becoming the first team in the Super Bowl era to lose three games in which they did not punt. Chargers kicker Cameron Dicker had a week to forget, too, when he missed a field goal and extra point in a four-point loss to the Texans despite entering the game as the most accurate kicker in NFL history.Clinchers: The Packers and Texans clinched postseason berths while the Bears, Broncos and Patriots won the NFC North, AFC West and AFC East, respectively. On the flip side, the Colts fell out of playoff contention and became the first team in 30 years to start a campaign 8-2 and miss the postseason.

    "body": "\n        Indianapolis Colts quarterback Philip Rivers refuses to doubt his decision to come out of a five-year retirement following Sunday's 23-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, his third in three starts. The Colts are the sixth NFL team in NFL history to start the season 8-2 and miss the playoffs, becoming the first so in 30 years after losing Daniel Jones to a season-ending injury. \"I told you guys I wasn't going to have any regrets about coming back and I don't,\" Rivers said. \"Other than us not winning ... it's been an absolute blast for three weeks. If I go back and say, 'All right, now you know everything's going to happen, what are you going to do?' I'd do it all again. It's been absolutely awesome. So, yeah, I mean, if it's the last one, it's the last one.\"The Colts are expected to start rookie Riley Leonard in their season finale against the Houston Texans. Rivers said he's \"on board\" with whatever decision comes down from coach Shane Steichen.\"I thought the last one was walking off the field in Buffalo or walking up that tunnel,\" Rivers said. \"And I was fine with that. And that one had tears those few days after. And I was at peace with that being the last one. So, certainly if it is [the last game], I got three bonus games that I never saw coming and couldn't be more thankful that I got an opportunity.\"The Colts became desperate after losing Jones with an inexperienced Leonard and third-team option Brett Rypien on roster at the position. Rivers worked out with the team, had to quickly ramp-up to playing shape and made his first start since 2020 during an 18-16 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\"I wasn't really hanging on to any hope of playing again,\" Rivers said after his initial arrival at the team facility. \"I kind of thought that ship had sailed. But something about it excited me. It's kind of one of those deals — a door opens and you can either walk through it and find out if you can do it, or run from it.\"I know that there's risk involved, obviously, on what may or may not happen. But the only way to find out is going for it. I just felt almost like it was a gift, another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys and the game you love to play and the dream that you got to live. You may get some bonus time.\"Over three starts, Rivers completed 58-of-92 passes for 544 yards and four touchdowns with three interceptions. He took five sacks and holds a QBR of 39.3. The Colts, however, are losers of six in a row.\n\"We were talking in there and I think the start, the hot start, is what probably makes this whole thing hurt even more,\" Rivers said. \"If it had been one of those kinds of back-and-forth years the whole year — you look up and you find a way to win eight, nine games and you go, 'Shoot, just kind of a grinding kind of year.' But the fact they were at eight (wins) so soon and it's just been a tough last six-game stretch or so.\"\n            ",

They were, however, on the wrong end of the scoreboard, and Garrett believes there was a strong correlation between the two.\n\"To an extent, I feel like they were more worried about keeping me away from Aaron [Rodgers] than, you know, getting the win, and I think that's what came back to bite them,\" Garrett said after the Browns' 13-6 upset win in Cleveland. \"They'll have to fight it out with Baltimore next week, but I'm just proud of the guys for fighting and getting this win. That's the main thing, and I'm always gonna keep it that.\"Garrett, who was often chipped by a running back or tight end or outright double-teamed, managed just two pressures on 43 pass rush snaps, a 4.7% rate. That was his second-lowest of the season; he had just a 4.2% pressure rate in the Week 6 game against Pittsburgh.Garrett remains at 22 sacks on the season, one behind breaking the record of 22.5 shared by Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021). Sunday represented Garrett's first game without at least a half-sack since that aforementioned Week 6 game against Pittsburgh. The Cleveland defense still dominated, though: Alex Wright and Grant Delpit both sacked Rodgers, who had a season-low 4.3 yards per attempt. As a result, the Steelers will host the Baltimore Ravens for the AFC North title in Week 18; Pittsburgh could have clinched the division with a win in Cleveland.\nGarrett, meanwhile, will have one more shot at the record when the Browns visit the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 18. Garrett had two sacks in the Week 1 matchup between the two teams.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 season is far from over but it's already time inspect the report card of the most expensive 2025 summer transfer window moves. Players like Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko kept us busy last summer with their moves, but their start of the season with their new clubs haven't gone as expected, while others have performed up to expectations and beyond. With the 2026 winter transfer window about to start, let's go back and grade the most expensive 2025 summer transfers: 10. Matheus CunhaFrom Wolverhampton to Manchester United for $84.5 million (add-ons included)Three goals scored so far in 16 games played between Premier League and EFL Cup with Manchester United, under Ruben Amorim, the former Wolverhampton striker has played regularly and he's having an impact, starting the last nine Premier League fixtures, scoring also two goals in the last three. He's improving, and the feeling is that things can get even better in the near future. Good start. Grade: B9. Victor Osimhen From Napoli to Galatasaray for $87.5 million (add-ons included)Even if this signing wasn't as exciting as the others on this list, the former Napoli striker performed wonderfully in the team he moved to in the summer of 2024 on loan. Galatasaray decided to invest big on him last summer, and they were wise in doing so -- 12 goals scored in 16 games so far, including six scored in the four games played in the Champions League league phase. It looks like he's fitting well in this team and he can achieve big things at Galatasaray this season. Grade: A8. Luis Diaz From Liverpool to Bayern Munich for $88.5 million (add-ons included)By far the best signing in the top 10. Luis Diaz is doing great things in Germany at Bayern Munich where he has already scored 13 goals in the 22 matches he played so far in all competitions, and also seven assists provided to his teammates. One goal every 137 minutes and an incredible impact in the team coached by Vincent Kompany, he is quickly becoming one of the big stars of the German giants. Grade: A+\n7. Eberechi EzeFrom Crystal Palace to Arsenal for $91 million (add-ons included)There were high expectations and ambitions after his late move to Arsenal after he almost agreed terms to join Tottenham. It was one of the biggest stories and surprises of the summer transfer window, and to be honest, we could expect a bit more from his performances. But he has done well in some exciting matches, particularly when he scored the hat trick, ironically against Tottenham in the North London derby won 4-1 by the Gunners. Grade: B6. Nick WoltemadeFrom Stuttgart to Newcastle for $93 million (add-ons included)The German striker suffered a bit from the poor performances and results of Newcastle in the opening part of the season, as the Magpies are currently sitting 14th in the Premier League standings with 23 points after 18 games. On the other hand, Woltemade already scored nine goals with his new team and showed to be at the level of the Premier League and his rivals. If his team also improve, we can expect a lot more goals from him. Grade: B-5. Bryan Mbuemo From Brentford to Manchester United for $95 million (add-ons included)Let's be honest -- when Manchester United signed him this summer, we all thought this was going to be another disappointment. Welp. Seven goals scored so far in the 17 matches he played, he immediately became one of the key players of the team coached by Amorim. He's now in Morocco where he's playing the AFCON with Cameroon, and Manchester United hope to see him back in the team as soon as possible. They need him. Grade: B+\n4. Benjamin Sesko From RB Leipzig to Manchester United for $99 million (add-ons included)The exact opposite of Mbuemo. Back in the summer, I thought he was going to shine and become an important player of Manchester United but so far he has only scored two goals in the 17 matches he has played with the Red Devils. I was expecting a bigger impact and stronger numbers from a player who has consistently impressed me in recent years, but he still has time. At just 22, there is a lot of potential waiting to be realized. Grade: C-3. Hugo Ekitike From Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool for $106 million (add-ons included)The French international immediately proved to be a crucial player in the team coached by Arne Slot. Ekitike has already scored 11 goals in the 24 matches he played and was definitely the best signing made by Liverpool this season, also because the other ones were really disappointing, at least up to now. Grade: B+2. Florian WirtzFrom Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool for $157 million (add-ons included). If the Ekitike signing was one of the best ones, we can't say the same about the Florian Wirtz move to Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen, especially considering the money the English team spent for the German striker. Wirtz scored his first goal for his new club over the weekend against Wolverhampton, but expectations were higher. There is still time for him to improve and adapting to the Premier League is never easy in the short term. He will need to show more in the second half of the season. Grade: C-\n1. Alexander Isak From Newcastle to Liverpool for $168 million (add-ons included). The Swedish striker was really disappointing so far, especially considering the money spent and the expectations after the saga of his transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool. He has scored only three goals in the first part of the season and is now sidelined with a leg injury that could keep him out for potentially months. They hoped something different in Liverpool. Grade: D\n            ",

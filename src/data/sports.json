    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series is tied again and is now down to a best-of-three series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays.The Blue Jays got to Shohei Ohtani in Game 4 Tuesday and he was on the hook for four runs, including a two-run home run by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Shane Bieber, on the other hand, held the Dodgers hitters to just one run, a sacrifice fly off the bat of Kiké Hernández. The Game 4 win ties the series at 2 and guarantees at least one more game in Toronto on Halloween. The Dodgers took a wild Game 3 on a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run in the 18th inning Monday. Yoshinobu Yamamoto tossed a complete game in Los Angeles' Game 2 win, while the Blue Jays won Game 1 in an 11-4 blowout, including a grand slam by Addison Barger as part of a nine-run sixth inning.The Dodgers are back in the World Series for the second year in a row, looking to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers last week and had a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. \nThe Blue Jays, meanwhile, took a tougher route through the ALCS but came out victorious in Game 7 against the Seattle Mariners. This marks their first World Series appearance since 1993.

    "body": "\n        Following his team's 6-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 4 of the World Series on Tuesday night, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts hinted at possible lineup changes moving forward. \"I think so,\" Roberts said to reporters when asked whether he was considering making adjustments to his batting order ahead of Game 5. \"I'm going to think long and hard and it might look a little bit different tomorrow.\"That's an unexpected dilemma for a team that during the regular season led the National League in OPS, runs scored, and home runs and across all of MLB ranked second to only the New York Yankees in those categories. Those trends, however, have not carried over into the World Series, which is now tied 2-2. \"We haven't found our rhythm,\" Roberts said of the team's offensive performance against Toronto thus far. \"We haven't. It sort of draws dead at certain parts of the lineup and different parts, different innings, different games. Guys are competing. Certainly, in the postseason, you're seeing everyone's best.\n\"But, yeah, my hope is we regroup tomorrow, gather the information that we had from [Trey] Yesavage, and keep him in the hitting zone and understand what that split does, which is certainly helpful, and when we get the fastball, really get on it.\"The Dodgers through the first four games of the series have scored 17 runs, which doesn't sound like a disastrous total until you consider that Game 3 spanned 18 innings. Overall, the Dodgers in the World Series are batting .214/.315/.377 and just .207/.294/.207 with runners in scoring position. That's out of character, and it's why Roberts is pondering changes. At an individual level, Mookie Betts, Andy Pages, Tommy Edman, and Kiké Hernández -- that's almost half the lineup – have struggled badly. That quartet against the Blue Jays has combined for a slash line of just .147/.203/.162. No matter how good the rest of the lineup has been, it's hard to score runs when you're lugging that around. In particular, it'll be interesting to see if Roberts adjusts Betts, who's batted in the No. 2 spot behind leadoff man Shohei Ohtani in every game of the playoffs and almost every game of the regular season. \nBy the sounds of it, Roberts is going to push every button he can to wring more offense out of a lineup that's been mostly tamed by Toronto. That's not exactly a sign of desperation for L.A. -- the series is tied, after all -- but it is that things need to get better or they risk getting worse for the defending champs. \n            ",

The cupboard, however, is far from bare in regards to White's play in the league, as he recorded five sacks a season ago.\nThe trading away of White continues the process of the Patriots forming their identity under Vrabel, who is overseeing the franchise's most successful season in some time. The Patriots lead the AFC East at 6-2 and are riding a five-game winning streak.\n            \n    ",

In the deal, the Steelers reportedly sent a sixth-round pick in exchange for Dugger and a seventh-round pick. To pave the way for the addition of Dugger, the Steelers are placing safety DeShon Elliott on injured reserve with a hyperextended knee, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport. Elliott was injured in last Sunday's loss to the Green Bay Packers. Dugger was a longtime starter in New England under Bill Belichick, but had fallen out of favor some under first-year coach Mike Vrabel. Dugger was reportedly available on the trade market before the start of the regular season as he was demoted to the second team. In seven games with four starts in 2025, Dugger has registered 17 combined tackles, but missed Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns due to a knee injury. \n        \n            \n                Steelers reportedly signing veteran safety Darrick Forrest as Mike Tomlin looks to fix sagging secondary\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDugger, who signed a four-year, $58 million contract extension in 2024, has started 69 of the 81 games he's played for the Patriots after the team selected him in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. Dugger was the second defensive player traded by the Patriots on Tuesday. The team also reportedly shipped defensive end Keion White to the San Francisco 49ers. \nThe Steelers are hoping that the addition of Dugger will help a secondary that has struggled recently. In Sunday's 35-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers, quarterback Jordan Love carved up the Steelers to the tune of 360 passing yards and three touchdowns. The Steelers also reportedly signed former Washington Commanders safety Darrick Forrest to their practice squad earlier Tuesday. This came after the team worked out veteran safeties Vonn Bell and Eddie Jackson.The Steelers got off to a 4-1 start, but have dropped consecutive games to the Cincinnati Bengals and the Packers. In those games, Pittsburgh's defense has given up 688 passing yards and six touchdowns.\nThe Steelers will attempt to end their two-game losing streak when they take on the Indianapolis Colts in Week 9.\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        The WNBA has offered the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) a 30-day extension to continue negotiations on a new collect",
    "body": "\n        The WNBA has offered the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) a 30-day extension to continue negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement, according to ESPN. The current CBA will expire on Friday (Oct. 31) unless the two sides agree to an extension or a new deal beforehand. Per ESPN, the players would only accept an extension \"under the right circumstances,\" but those circumstances \"do not yet exist.\" This would not be the first time that the two sides have needed an extension to complete negotiations on a new CBA. In fact, an extension was necessary to complete the current CBA. In 2019, the two sides announced a 60-day extension before agreeing to a new deal in Jan. 2020.If the two sides cannot agree to an extension, or the extension comes and goes without another extension or a new deal, the next step would be a work stoppage. At that point, all league business would cease -- players would not even be able to access practice facilities -- but negotiations would continue. \nThe WNBA has never lost games to a work stoppage, but it has come close. In 2003, there was still no deal in place by early April and then-NBA commissioner David Stern issued an ultimatum to come to terms on a new CBA by April 18 or the season would be cancelled. The two sides did just that. As a result, the 2003 WNBA Draft was delayed, as were preseason games. WNBPA senior advisor and legal counsel Erin Drake told The Athletic on Tuesday that the two sides will not agree on a new CBA before Oct. 31. \"We have worked hard to be able to say on Friday, we did it. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen,\" Drake said. \"In a dance, it takes two to tango. And it has been difficult to find a beat, to find a rhythm and to find the same sense of urgency [from the league], just to be frank, to get this done.\"\nIn a statement released to ESPN, the league responded by stating it had made an offer to the players on Oct. 1, which had been ignored until Monday. \"We have been negotiating with the Players Association in good faith and with urgency for several months with the goal of finalizing a new collective bargaining agreement as quickly as possible,\" a WNBA spokesperson told ESPN. \"Throughout this process, we have been clear that our top priority is reaching a new collective bargaining agreement that addresses players' ask for significant increases in pay, benefits and enhancements to their experience, while ensuring the long-term growth and success of the league and its teams.\"We urge the Players Association to spend less time disseminating public misinformation and more time joining us in constructive engagement across the table.\"\nThe WNBA and the WNBPA have been embroiled in a bitter labor dispute for over a year. In October of 2024, the players announced their intention to opt out of the current CBA. \"This is a defining moment, not just for the WNBA, but for all of us who believe in progress,\" WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike said in a statement at the time. \"The world has evolved since 2020, and we cannot afford to stand still. If we stay in the current agreement, we fall behind.\"Opting out isn't just about bigger paychecks -- it's about claiming our rightful share of the business we've built, improving working conditions, and securing a future where the success we create benefits today's players and the generations to come. We're not just asking for a CBA that reflects our value; we're demanding it, because we've earned it.\"\nIn recent months, the tension between the players and the league, and specifically commissioner Cathy Engelbert, has heightened. Most notably, WNBPA vice president Napheesa Collier delivered a scathing rebuke of Engelbert during her exit interview following the conclusion of the Minnesota Lynx's season. \"We have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now we have the worst leadership in the world,\" Collier said, while also accusing Engelbert of making disparaging remarks about players, including Caitlin Clark.Engelbert later addressed the criticism during her pre-Finals press conference. \n\"I have the utmost respect for Napheesa and every single player in our league,\" she said. \"They are at the center of everything we do. I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and me personally do not care about them or listen to them, and if the players in the W don't feel appreciated and valued by the league, then we have to do better and I have to do better.\"The main sticking point between the two sides is the revenue sharing model. Under the current CBA, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, reports indicate that players only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive.While Engelbert and NBA commissioner Adam Silver have both publicly supported raising player salaries, they have pushed back on revenue sharing. \n\"I think share isn't the right way to look at it because there's so much more revenue in the NBA,\" Silver said earlier this month. \"I think you should look at absolute numbers in terms of what they are making. They are going to get a big increase in this cycle of collective bargaining and they deserve it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michael Jordan shared his insights on load management as the second installment of the \"Insights to Excellence\" series aired after the Bucks 121-111 win over the Knicks on Tuesday night. Unsurprisingly, Jordan isn't a fan of the increase in players taking games off to rest their bodies over the course of the 82-game season.\"It shouldn't be needed, first and foremost,\" Jordan said. \"You know, I never wanted to miss a game because it was an opportunity to prove -- it was something that I felt like, you know, the fans are there that watch me play. I want to impress that guy way up on top who probably worked his ass off to get a ticket or to get money to buy the ticket.\"\nOver his 15-year Hall of Fame career, Jordan rarely played in fewer than 70 games in a season. In fact, the three times it happened, one was due to a broken foot that limited him to 18 games his sophomore season, the second was when he came out of retirement midseason in 1995, and the third was in his first season after coming out of retirement the second time.\"You have a duty that if they're wanting to see you and as an entertainer, I want to show, right?\" Jordan said. \"So if the guys are coming to watch me play, I don't want to miss that opportunity. Physically, if I can't do it, then I can't do it. But physically, if I can do it and I just don't feel like doing it, that's a whole different lens.\"\n        \n            \n                Michael Jordan discusses last time shooting a ball, why he wishes he could still play in broadcast debut\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJordan then referenced his famed \"flu game\" during the 1997 NBA Finals. In Game 5 of that series against the Utah Jazz, Jordan fought off flu-like symptoms to lead the Chicago Bulls to a win and take a 3-2 lead in the series. Despite running a temperature of 103 degrees, Jordan dropped 38 points in the win.\n\"I could never leave my comrades if I could perform. Utah, great example. You know, everybody said it's a Game 5, which is very pivotal game,\" Jordan said. \"I was going to find a way to get out there, even if I was a decoy. Well, once I got out there, you never know how you're pushing yourself. You never know what happens, right? Next thing you know, the emotions, the situation, the need of the team, all those things catapulted me to, I'm gonna gut this thing out.\"Jordan is far from the only legend of his era to criticize load management, but trying to compare the two eras is like comparing apples and oranges. The game was far more physical in Jordan's era, but the game is much faster today, and more demanding even without the level of physicality that existed in the '80s and '90s.Load management is also often not a decision made by the players. \"It's usually not the player that is going to the training staff and saying, 'Hey, I don't have it tonight.' It's usually the other way around,\" Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry once said. \"There's a lot of science involved.\"\nBut something tells me that even if a team doctor told Jordan he should sit a game to rest his body, he'd probably say no. That's just the type of player he was.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If this EFL Cup were taking place a year ago, it'd mean something quite different to Tottenham and Newcastle United, but that doesn't mean that it's not a meaningful one. The Magpies are the reigning champions of this tournament, while Tottenham also ended a trophy drought by lifting the Europa League, but both teams have rotation concerns while balancing Champions League play, but it'll still be an important clash for both in pursuit of back-to-back seasons winning a trophy.How to watch Newcastle United vs. Tottenham, oddsDate: Wednesday, Oct. 29 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: St. James' Stadium -- Newcastle Upon Tyne, EnglandLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Newcastle United -165; Draw +290; Tottenaham +380Early on this campaign, Tottenham are challenging Arsenal for their title as \"Set Piece FC,\" but it's also papering over cracks in their attack. Only Chelsea and Arsenal have scored more goals than Tottenham's five from dead-ball deliveries among top-tier English clubs, and Van De Ven has had a monopoly on those scoring three of his goals in Premier League play from these situations. But when it comes to overall attacking performance, Tottenham have scored 17 goals in the league from an xG of only 10.08. While set pieces have been a major help, any competition is a chance for Thomas Frank to work on where his team is falling short in open play.Frank's Brentford side also took advantage of set plays while also hitting teams on the counter, but Tottenham haven't been able to do that with the midfield struggling to create chances. An away trip to face Newcastle won't help with those matters either. Eddie Howe has responded to losing Alexander Isak by making the Magpies a more defensively stout side. They've allowed an xG of 7.27 in Premier League play, second behind only Arsenal.Because of that, this is a game that will mean a bit more to Frank's Tottenham than Newcastle, but that doesn't mean that Howe won't want to win as well. Newcastle have six points from their first three Champions League fixture, while Tottenham have five points from their three fixtures. Both are on the right path to advancing out of the league phase, but Tottenham's overperformance is a cause for concern.\nVan De Ven is their leading scorer in all competitions ahead of Richarlison with three goals. Richarlison also hasn't scored in his last seven appearances in all competitions after a hot start to the season. It's not something that is great when Dominic Solanke is injured and Randal Kolo Muani has also yet to score his first goal for the club. If anything, it's impressive that Tottenham's defensive improvement has been able to get them to this point, but it also can only last for so long as the season continues.Figuring out the proper midfield configuration to take Spurs to the next level has to be at the top of Frank's to-do list, and cup matches are good times to try new things in that aspect. Pape Sarr and Lucas Bergvall have had their moments as 10s, but neither has done the job as a box-to-box midfielder. Someone who could get a shot is 19-year-old Archie Gray. A highly rated recruit last season, Gray played a full 90 at left back in the Champions League against Monaco, but his two-way ability could get a chance facing Newcastle United.\nIf he's able to help Tottenham get past Howe's stout defense, the route to more playing time is an easy one, but the former won't be an easy task with a spot in the last eight of the cup on the line.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NCAA Division I Board voted Tuesday to delay the effective date of the legislative change that would permit college athletes to gamble on professional sports, pushing it back from Nov. 1 to Nov. 22. The move comes amid immense pushback from notable figures in college athletics, particularly SEC commissioner Greg Sankey, who voiced his concerns over the repealing of the NCAA's longstanding prohibition on sports betting.That the NCAA delayed the effective date to Nov. 22 in particular comes with important ramifications. That date is one day after the close of a membership rescission period in which Division I schools can vote to overturn proposed legislation. Division I rules state that schools may vote to rescind a proposal within 30 days if it is adopted by less than a 75% majority by the Division I cabinet.\nGiven the widespread opposition to the NCAA's new gambling legislation -- and that illegal gambling is in the headlines in the wake of the federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests -- there appears to be a legitimate chance that it is voted down during the rescission period.\n        \n            \n                Greg Sankey urges NCAA to nix rule change permitting sports betting: 'Major step in the wrong direction'\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSankey said in a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker that SEC presidents and chancellors have concerns with the legislation's impacts on competition, integrity and athlete well-being. Those feelings are also present in other leagues like the ACC, where Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi called the legislation \"absolutely one of the stupidest decisions I've ever seen.\"\nThe rule change does not alter the NCAA's stances on gambling in college athletics. Athletes will remain prohibited from betting on college games and sharing information with bettors. The legislation also includes plans to provide additional education and support to prevent problem gambling.\"On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association's commitment to maintaining strong national standards that keep collegiate participants separated from sports wagering activity at every level,\" Sankey said in his letter to the NCAA. \"If there are legal or practical concerns about the prior policy, those should be addressed through careful refinement -- not through wholesale removal of the guardrails that have long supported the integrity of games and the well-being of those who participate.\"Narduzzi pointed out recent issues in professional sports, including the NBA, which last week saw Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier arrested by the FBI as part of a federal investigation into illegal gambling.\n\"First of all, it's a habit,\" Narduzzi said. \"It's no different than smoking, drinking, doing drugs, it's a bad habit. I don't think anyone here encourages you guys to go out drinking and getting smashed on a Friday night or Saturday night, or at a ball game.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nAfter Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season, it appeared to be a foregone conclusion that the Pittsburgh Steelers would win their first AFC North title in five years. However, there are signs that the Baltimore Ravens are not yet ready to relinquish the throne.Pittsburgh won four of its first five games during four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers' first -- and possibly only -- season with the club. Meanwhile, Baltimore dropped five of its first six contests and lost two-time MVP Lamar Jackson to a hamstring injury along the way.The road has gotten rocky for the Steelers of late, however. After being edged on the road 33-31 by the division-rival Cincinnati Bengals in Week 7, they lost a 35-25 decision at home to the NFC North-leading Green Bay Packers this past Sunday.The Ravens had a chance to lick their wounds as they were on a bye in Week 7, and the rest seemed to do them good as they returned to post a 30-16 victory against the Chicago Bears. Derrick Henry ran for a pair of touchdowns and Tyler Huntley took over at quarterback for Cooper Rush and performed well in his first start of the year, completing 17 of 22 pass attempts for 186 yards and a TD while also gaining 53 yards on the ground.Things won't be getting any easier for Pittsburgh, which hosts the NFL-leading Indianapolis Colts this Sunday. The Steelers then take on the Los Angeles Chargers, Bengals, Bears and Buffalo Bills before a showdown in Baltimore in Week 14.The Steelers are 22-8 all-time against the Colts but have lost the last two meetings following an eight-game winning streak in the series. And now they face an Indianapolis team that has won four in a row, ranks first in the NFL in both total offense (385.3 yards per game) and scoring (33.8 points) and features the league's top rusher in Jonathan Taylor (850 yards), who is first with 12 touchdown runs and has registered three overall TDs in four of his last six games.\nConversely, the Ravens play their next five games against sub-.500 opponents, beginning with a Week 9 road matchup with the 2-6 Miami Dolphins on Thursday Night Football. And it's all but certain that Jackson will return from his injury and be under center at Hard Rock Stadium.\"I feel very confident about it,\" Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh told reporters on Monday. \"We'll expect him to be out there Thursday night.\"The prospect of facing Miami likely has Jackson salivating. The 28-year-old is just 2-2 lifetime against the Dolphins but has come up with a few amazing performances, especially in the victories. Jackson finished with over 320 passing yards, five touchdown tosses and no interceptions in each win, with Baltimore scoring at least 56 points both times, and threw for 318 yards and three TDs while also running for 119 yards and a score in a 42-38 loss in 2022.\nDespite the Steelers' back-to-back losses, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and its projection model currently still like their chances of winning the AFC North. The ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, feels Pittsburgh's outlook increases by almost 13% with a victory over Indianapolis and a loss by Baltimore in Week 9.A Steelers loss and Ravens win against the Dolphins still would leave Pittsburgh with a better than 57% chance to capture the division title. But those results would increase Baltimore's current outlook by nearly 11%, according to the model's simulations. Both teams' chances of making the playoffs are similar to their AFC North title chances in all instances.PITTSBURGH STEELERSAFC NORTH TITLE %PLAYOFF %Entering Week 969.7%76.2%Week 9 win + Baltimore loss82.4%86.4%Week 9 loss + Baltimore win57.3%63.7%BALTIMORE RAVENSAFC NORTH TITLE %PLAYOFF %Entering Week 923.2%27.1%Week 9 win + Pittsburgh loss34.1%37.5%Week 9 loss + Pittsburgh win12.0%13.8%Baltimore is a 7.5-point favorite on Thursday Night Football against Miami, which is coming off a 34-10 victory against the Atlanta Falcons that ended its three-game losing streak. The Dolphins have shown an ability to be competitive, as three of their six losses this year were by one score.Meanwhile, the Steelers are 3-point underdogs versus the Colts, who led the Los Angeles Rams by seven points with less than 3 1/2 minutes remaining in their lone loss this season. Five of Indianapolis' seven wins were by double digits, with three being by at least 24 points.According to the model, the Ravens outlast the Dolphins in Jackson's return, as it is predicting a 34-27 victory by Baltimore. The model also sees Pittsburgh keeping up with Indianapolis but ultimately suffering a 27-26 loss. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Toronto Blue Jays designated hitter George Springer is not in the Game 4 lineup Tuesday night, but the team does not seem likely to remove from their World Series roster after he exited Game 3 with a side injury Monday. Removing Springer from the roster would rule him out for the rest of the series. He could not be added back later.\"MRI showed that he's hour-to-hour, day-to-day, so just see how he kind of navigates the next couple hours,\" manager John Schneider said Tuesday before Game 4 (via Sportsnet). \"... Right now the options are either in the lineup or on the bench.\"Bichette is in at DH instead and left fielder Nathan Lukes is hitting leadoff.Follow live updates from Dodgers vs. Blue Jays Game 4Springer suffered the injury during Monday's marathon Game 3, which the Blue Jays eventually lost to the Dodgers 6-5 in 18 innings. In the seventh inning, Springer after fouling off a pitch immediately clutched his right side in obvious discomfort. Soon after he exited the game accompanied by a trainer and was replaced by Ty France: The injury was initially announced as right side discomfort, and Schneider said postgame that Springer had already left to undergo an MRI. The team has not shared the results of the MRI. They seem to be hoping Springer will be able to play again at some point, even if not until Game 6 or 7 later this week.\n\"He plays for moments like this,\" Schneider said Tuesday. \"I think I told you guys yesterday, whenever this season's over, you guys will be surprised to see kind of how much he has grinded physically. So yeah, if he's good to go in any way, shape, or form, I want George in.\"Losing Springer, Toronto's leadoff hitter and one of its most productive players in 2025, would be a serious one. During the regular season, the 36-year-old Springer reversed a pattern of decline and put up one of his best-ever seasons at the plate: \nHis OPS+ of 161 led the team and also ranked third among American League qualifiers. Springer is also one of the most prolific postseason power hitters in MLB history, as he ranks third all-time on the playoff home run list. During the Jays' current run, he's batted .246/.323/.561 with four home runs and six doubles in 14 games.\nOutfielder Joey Loperfido would be the obvious replacement should Springer come off the roster. The 26-year-old Loperfido, who bats left-handed, is a career .248/.297/.392 hitter with eight home runs in 122 games spread across parts of two MLB seasons. He was rostered for part of the Blue Jays' ALCS win over the Seattle Mariners as an injury replacement for Anthony Santander. Loperfido went hitless in one at-bat in that series.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Entering the final month of the regular season, 11 of 67 Power Four teams are still searching for their first conference victory. Assessing the remaining schedules of those struggling squads, it appears likely that we'll top last year's tally of three P4 teams that finished winless in league action.A year ago, those three teams were Purdue, Mississippi State and Oklahoma State. Those three are once again winless in league action as calendar is about to flip to November. For now, they have plenty of company.If Penn State and Michigan State are still among the Big Ten's crop of four winless teams in league play come Nov. 15, something will have to give since they play each other that day. But outside of those two, none of the other nine Power Four teams still in search of a league victory play one of their winless brethren.The situation looks particularly bleak for Purdue and Wisconsin. The Boilermakers play ranked opponents in three of their final four games, and the other contest is on the road against a 6-2 Washington team. Wisconsin plays four teams with records of 5-3 or better down the stretch.\nThis year's Bottom 25 formula has been tweaked to ensure fair representation from across the sport. Each of the Power Four leagues gets an automatic bid to the Bottom 25 each week, and a total of 10 Power Four schools must be represented.Bottom 25 Rankings^ Joined Bottom 25 this weekBluegrass bluesOn the heels of a 4-8 season, Kentucky will exit October without a victory against a Power Four opponent. Fire Mark Stoops, right? Well, it's not that simple. As the Lexington Herald-Leader reported, Stoops would be owed nearly $38 million within 60 days if he's fired. That's different than many coach buyouts, which can be spread out over the life of the contract and mitigated by a coach's future earnings. With Auburn, Florida and Tennessee Tech up next, maybe the Cats can catch fire and salvage their season. But based on what we've seen so far, it seems unlikely.25. Kentucky^24. Purdue (22)23. Arkansas (25)22. Louisiana-Monroe^21. West Virginia (21)Worthless winsTypically speaking, a victory for any team in the Bottom 25 is regarded as such an impressive achievement that it results in a big jump. Often, a Bottom 25 team will escape the ranking altogether after a victory. But in South Alabama's case, a 38-31 win at Georgia State barely moved the needle. Why? Because it was against Georgia State. That's what we call a Bottom 25 Battle Royale, and you don't get much credit for beating one of the few teams who are actually worse than you.\n20. Louisiana (21)19. South Alabama (18)18. Florida State (20)17. Colorado State^16. Northern Illinois (11)No. 1 vs. No. 11 (sort of)The idea of Ohio State being ranked No. 1 and Penn State being ranked No. 11 for their Week 10 showdown would have made perfect sense before the season. ... until you were told that Penn State is No. 11 in the Bottom 25. Even being No. 11 in the AP poll at this juncture would have been a disappointment for the Nittany Lions in what was supposed to be an \"all in\" year. But disappointing is an insufficient term to describe Penn State's level of failure in 2025. Which is exactly why it would be so funny if this were the year it beat Ohio State for the first time since 2016.15. Tulsa (19)14. Eastern Michigan (17)13. North Carolina (15)12. UTEP (14)11. Penn State (11)\nWisconsin hits a milestoneIt's too early to call it an offensive renaissance, but Wisconsin hit a major milestone in its 21-7 loss to Oregon, as the Badgers snapped a 14 quarter touchdown drought. Yes, that's correct. Between the first quarter of October and the final quarter of October, the Badgers did not score a touchdown. But the long nightmare ended late this past Saturday with Hunter Simmons' 2-yard touchdown pass to Lance Mason. Will Wisconsin score more than two touchdowns in November? The opponents are all 5-3 or better, so it might be close.10. Nevada (12)9. Wisconsin (10)8. Oregon State (9)7. Boston College (7)6. Middle Tennessee (6)Bad CharlotteCharlotte was doing the dang thing through a quarter and a half. The 49ers led North Texas, one of the American's top teams, by a score of 17-7. From there, they showed why they've become a mainstay in the seediest rungs of the Bottom 25. North Texas outscored Charlotte 47-3 over the final two and a half quarters. The 49ers gave up 27 points in the fourth quarter alone as Mean Green quarterback Drew Mestemaker tossed for a school record 608 yards. When it was all said and done, Charlotte surrendered 754 yards.\n5. Charlotte (5)4. Georgia State (4)3. Oklahoma State (3)2. Sam Houston (2)1. UMass (1)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are officially one week into the NBA season and the level of competition across the league has been unreal. It seems like every national TV game has gone to overtime, if not double overtime. Victor Wembanyama is playing a brand of basketball never before seen. Stephen Curry is cooking up his regular dishes. Luka Doncic is averaging 46.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists. But on some level, none of that is surprising. We knew the Knicks were going to shoot more 3s under Mike Brown (and indeed they are) and we knew the Celtics were probably going to struggle (and indeed they have). But what about the stuff we didn't see coming? That could be a long list (are the Jazz good?), but I'm going to focus on five of the best first-week surprises. Austin Reaves is your total-point leaderReaves' legit card has long been stamped, but this is something else. Through four games, Reaves is averaging 35.8 PPG. His 143 total points are tied with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for tops in the league entering play Tuesday. He went for 51 on Sunday in a win over the Kings, missing a triple-double by one assist and becoming the first player in history to record at least 50 points, eight rebounds and eight assists on 80% true shooting in a single game. \nHe then backed that up with 41 on Monday in a loss to the Blazers. \nDo the math, and that's 92 points in about 30 hours for Reaves, who is making quite the bid for a max contract when he becomes a free agent this coming summer. The numbers speak for themselves, but it's worth noting that Reaves did what he did against the Blazers, even though he was the clear focus of the defense with both Luka Doncic and LeBron James out. \nReaves has racked up a league-leading 51 free throws so far and he's not grifting. He's way more shifty than you think and a true tough-shot maker. He's one of two guys in the league averaging at least 35 points, eight boards and six rebounds (the other is Luka Doncic, who's only played in two games), and his 57/43/88 shooting splits are scorching by any standard, let alone at the volume Reaves has activated. Reaves' usage will surely dip when James returns, but playing like this, you can make a case that LeBron will be the one having to fit in around what might be the Lakers' new dynamic duo, both short and long term. A first All-Star selection could be in Reaves' sights if he continues at anything close to this level. \n        \n            \n                How scorching starts from Austin Reaves and Luka Dončić could redefine LeBron James' role on new-look Lakers\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJonathan Kuminga flipping script on Warriors sagaKuminga and the Warriors have gone from an arranged marriage to basketball soulmates in the blink of an eye. Through four games, Kuminga, who went for 24 points on 9 of 14 shooting, 10 rebounds and four assists in the Warriors' win over Memphis on Monday, is averaging career highs across the board: 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists with a through-the-roof 69.5 true-shooting percentage. \nKuminga has never been anywhere near this efficient. He's never rebounded like this. Passed like this. Defended like this. His sudden feel for the Warriors' play-off-Steph's-movement system, and his place within it, is palpable. Steve Kerr has glowed about Kuminga's maturity, and understandably so. After the tension of his contract saga this summer, to come back to a team that seemingly only signed him because no one else would trade much for him, and likely with the intention of still trading him before the deadline, and play with this kind of commitment to, well, the team is extraordinary stuff. On appreciably lower usage than he's required in the past, Kuminga is doing more than ever; gone are the solo-mission mid-rangers that he long shot at a paltry percentage. After a couple of bad shots in the season opener, he has played basically perfect basketball, and as such has seemingly cemented himself, at least for however long this keeps up, in both the starting and finishing lineup. \nAgain, when the Warriors signed Kuminga to a two-year, $46.5 million deal this summer, with the second season being a team option, it was widely regarded as a contract priced to move. But if Kuminga keeps playing like this, barring some sort of superstar deal in which Kuminga is the central outgoing figure, Golden State might not be able to afford to lose him. \nThe Bulls are undefeated!Everyone's favorite \"what the hell is their plan\" punchline has started the season with wins over the Pistons, Magic and Hawks -- all teams widely considered to be fringe Eastern Conference contenders -- by way of a 104.4 defensive rating that is tied with Oklahoma City for the class of the league. That won't continue. But the Bulls look genuinely good with a deep roster quietly full of quality NBA players, six of which (Nikola Vucevic, Josh Giddey, Ayo Dosunmu, Kevin Huerter, Matas Buzelis and Tre Jones) are averaging 13 PPG or more. They contest every shot (even if there's always shooting luck baked into early-season defensive metrics, this is evident), and they're rebounding at a top-five rate to punctuate all those stops. In Monday's win over Atlanta, eight guys scored at least 12 points, led by Dosumnu's 21 off the bench. Vucevic has been on fire all year, albeit probably unsustainably. Giddey is playing like an All-Star. Dosumnu, a lights-out defender, has cashed nine of his 15 3-pointers. If you haven't already scored a seat on the Buzelis hype train, sorry, no room left. \nThings are about to get tough for the Bulls, who face the Knicks twice, Sixers, Bucks, Cavs, Spurs, Pistons and Nuggets in eight of their next 10. We'll see if this is something to really talk about or just a phony hot start from a team once again headed straight for the play-in, but something tells me this is a team that is going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of opponents this year. Ajay Mitchell is breaking outJust when you thought the Oklahoma City Thunder, with their young championship roster and 11 potential first-round picks rolling in over the next seven drafts, couldn't get any richer, here comes Mitchell and probably the breakout player of the young season. \nIt hasn't come entirely out of left field. You saw his ability last season in irregular/mop-up stints and he was a Summer League star, but there was just no room for him to get consistent minutes. He wasn't part of the playoff rotation. But with Jalen Williams, Isaiah Joe and Kenrich Williams all sidelined to start the season, Mitchell has taken full advantage of his time to shine by scoring at least 14 points in all four games off the bench. \nAnd this isn't supplementary stuff. He has been a legit go-to scorer in crucial stretches, almost impossible to guard at times with his elite balance, shifty/stop-start cadence and deft gray-area touch in traffic. MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander says Michell just \"knows how to play,\" and as generic as that assessment may sound, it couldn't ring more true. Watch the footwork. The instructional-video perfection on his show-and-go drives. The craft of his pump fakes. His midrange pull-up bag is deep; he can do it going both ways, and his downhill acceleration hits like a punch. \nThis is actually laughable that OKC, with all its talent and future assets, has a guy this good just hanging around in the depth-chart shadows. Every team in the league would kill for a backup point guard like this; the Mavericks, Rockets, Timberwolves, or a half-dozen other teams would jump at the chance to insert him as their starting point guard right now. This is not a fluke. This dude can flat out play. He's going to be a major contributor for the Thunder even when all these guys get back, and he just may become one of the league's hottest trade assets as the deadline nears. As if the Thunder need any more of those. \nA buffet of 50 piecesThe regular season is one week old and we've already had four 50-point performances. Aaron Gordon went nuts in Denver's opener against the Warriors with 50 on 10 3-pointers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put up a career-high 55 in a double-overtime win over the Pacers. Austin Reaves, as noted above, hung 51 on the Kings on Sunday. And on Tuesday, Lauri Markkanen gave the Suns 51. This marks just the second time in NBA history that we've had four 50-point games in the month of October (Wilt Chamberlain did it four times himself in 1962, and Blake Griffin, Stephen Curry, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving did it in 2018). That gives us four nights, beginning Tuesday, to break the record with one more 50-piece. Frankly, the record should already have been broken. Luka Doncic went to the line with 48 points against the Timberwolves but was only able to split the free throws before being pulled to end on 49. \n            ",

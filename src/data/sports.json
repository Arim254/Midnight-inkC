    "body": "\n        With nine weeks in the books and the trade deadline in the rearview mirror, we've officially reached the midway point of the 2025 regular season. As expected, some unexpected results have sprouted through the first half of the year, with teams that we thought may not be contenders suddenly bursting onto the scene, while those we imagined would be vying for high playoff seeding have fallen by the wayside. Individually, there have been eye-popping production, both good and bad. For instance, who had the Daniel Jones-led Indianapolis Colts finding themselves as the current No. 1 seed in the AFC? What about the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots sitting in first place in their respective divisions? On the flip side, seeing the Kansas City Chiefs in third place in the AFC West is jarring, along with both the Baltimore Ravens and Washington Commanders sitting below .500. It just goes to show that the NFL will always keep your head spinning. As we've arrived at this mile marker, it's time to take a snapshot of where every team in the league stands and hand out our first-half grades.AFC East \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England Patriots: ARecord entering Week 10: 7-2 (first place in AFC East)Are the Patriots ... back? It sure looks like it. New England finds itself in first place in the AFC East after a 7-2 start to the year, which includes a win in Buffalo against Josh Allen and the Bills. The key aspect of the club's hot first half has been the second-year leap from Drake Maye, who has played himself into the MVP conversation. Maye currently leads the NFL in completion percentage (74.1%), which is made only more impressive when paired with his 9.0-yards-per-attempt average (third-highest in the NFL). On top of Maye's ascent, Mike Vrabel has completely changed the culture for the Patriots, particularly on the defense side of the ball, as they are holding opponents to 18.8 points per game (tied for fifth-lowest in the NFL). They have exceeded expectations. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills: BRecord entering Week 10: 6-2 (second place in AFC East)Buffalo was the heaviest favorite in the NFL to win its respective division, so to see the Bills outside of first place in the AFC East at the midway point is somewhat alarming. They had a two-game losing skid to the Patriots at home and then to the Falcons on the road, but they've rebounded well. At 6-2, they are still well within play in the division and have head-to-head victories over the Baltimore Ravens (Week 1) and Kansas City Chiefs (Week 9), which are strong feathers in their cap. Josh Allen continues to be arguably the best quarterback in the NFL, and the defense is top 10 in the league in points allowed per game (20.9).\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins: D-Record entering Week 10: 2-7 (third place in AFC East)Coming into the season, the Dolphins were pegged as a team teetering on a free fall. And they've since fallen to the depths of the AFC. Miami finds itself 2-7 at the midway points, already parting ways with GM Chris Grier, and it feels like both Mike McDaniel and Tua Tagovailoa's days are numbered as well. They are coming off a demoralizing loss to the Ravens, which was the largest home loss under McDaniel. More broadly, the Dolphins defense is among the worst in the league, surrendering 5.9 yards per play (tied for fourth-highest) and allowing an opposing passer rating of 114.4 (worst in the NFL). Offensively, they've committed a league-high 15 turnovers this season. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Jets: FRecord entering Week 10: 1-7 (fourth place in AFC East)The Jets have given up on 2025, and it's hard to blame them. At the deadline, New York had a fire sale, shipping away the likes of Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams in exchange for a treasure trove of picks. This comes after they began the year 0-7 and looked on their way to possibly going winless before pulling off an upset over the Bengals in Week 8. Despite that lone victory, this has been an abject failure of a season for the Jets, who have already benched Justin Fields for Tyrod Taylor and are 0-5 at home for just the fourth time in franchise history. It may be early November, but New York is already looking toward the 2026 NFL Draft. \nAFC North\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Steelers: B+Record entering Week 10: 5-3 (first place in AFC North)The Aaron Rodgers experiment has largely worked out for Pittsburgh. They Steelers currently sit atop the AFC North with a two-game lead entering Week 10, and Rodgers has found a bit of the fountain of youth. His 17 touchdown passes this season are the most by a Steelers quarterback through eight games since Ben Roethlisberger in 2021. He's been particularly dialed in on the road with a 114.7 passer rating in three games outside of Acrisure Stadium. The Steelers also just took it to the Colts, who came into their Week 9 matchup with an NFL-best 7-1 record. So what keeps them out of the \"A\" range? Their defense has been spotty. They generated six takeaways in the winning effort last week, but are allowing 278.3 yards passing per game (most in the NFL and most through eight games in franchise history). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens: CRecord entering Week 10: 3-5 (second place in AFC North)It was a nightmarish start for Baltimore to begin 2025. Not only did the Ravens begin the year 1-5, but they were hit with a slew of injuries, which included Lamar Jackson. Despite that horrid start, they've rebounded well, and it's no surprise that it coincided with them getting healthier on both sides of the ball. Jackson looked like his MVP self against Miami and currently leads the NFL in passer rating (136.7). Defensively, they've held opponents to just 13 points per game since Week 6, which is tied for second in the NFL. They've inched closer to the Steelers for first place in the AFC North, and are still the betting favorite to ultimately win the division. It hasn't been a perfect start by any stretch of the imagination, but there's a path toward landing on their feet. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cincinnati Bengals: FRecord entering Week 10: 3-6 (third place in AFC North)The Bengals have been one of the more maddening teams in the NFL. Yes, Joe Burrow got hurt and has been sidelined, which has put them behind the eight-ball. That said, this team has had opportunities to weather the storm, but has failed miserably in doing so. Defensively, they might be the worst unit in the NFL. It doesn't matter if the offense drops anywhere between 38 and 42 points; they'll find a way to let the opposition score more. They are surrendering a league-high 33.3 points per game and have just gone back-to-back games allowing the game-winning score inside of two minutes. Last week, it came with just 25 seconds remaining. Given those numbers, would it even matter if Burrow were under center instead of Joe Flacco? If the defense is giving up 47 points like it did last week against Chicago, you're losing regardless. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns: DRecord entering Week 10: 2-6 (fourth place in AFC North)Cleveland wasn't expected to be competitive in 2025, so the Browns are probably right about where most thought they'd be. The defense has remained their calling card, while the offense is still a work in progress. They've hit a number of pieces in the 2025 NFL Draft from Mason Graham to Quinshon Judkins to Harold Fannin Jr., but it's still a question at quarterback. Dillon Gabriel has shown flashes, but not enough that make him a bona fide franchise centerpiece. He currently has an NFL-low 4.9 yards per attempt this season. AFC South\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis Colts: ARecord entering Week 10: 7-2 (first place in AFC South)Indy's ascension is the biggest surprise of the first half. At the moment, they Colts are 7-2 and the No. 1 seed in the AFC with Daniel Jones leading the way. No one saw that coming. Even after falling to the Steelers in Week 9, the Colts still lead the NFL in points per game (32.2) and in points per game differential (+12.1). Jonathan Taylor has been a one-man wrecking crew out of the backfield, leading the NFL in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. Rookie tight end Tyler Warren has also been a Day 1 contributor. This team has been so good that the front office doubled down on them and pulled off a deadline day blockbuster for former Jets All-Pro corner Sauce Gardner. The good times may continue to roll in the second half.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jacksonville Jaguars: B-Record entering Week 10: 5-3 (second place in AFC South)Jacksonville is one of the tougher teams to pinpoint. On the one hand, the Jaguars are 5-3, nipping on the heels of the juggernaut Colts in the division and currently in the playoff picture as the No. 7 seed. On the other hand, however, they haven't exactly jumped off the page when watching them on the field. Defensively, they are third in the league in takeaways (15), but have the fewest sacks (10) in the NFL. Offensively, Trevor Lawrence is 32nd among 33 qualified quarterbacks in completion percentage (59.7%) this season. It's been good, not great, so a \"B-\" is sufficient. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Texans: C-Record entering Week 10: 3-5 (third place in AFC South)Houston entered the season as the betting favorite to win the AFC South and is now struggling to stay in the playoff conversation. The Texans' 3-5 record is the worst eight-game start to a season under DeMeco Ryans, and they are an NFL-worst 0-5 in one-score games. The offense can't seem to find its footing and owns the worst red zone touchdown percentage (36.4%) in the NFL, and is also the second-worst third-down offense (32.4%). What keeps them out of falling into the \"D\" range has been their stellar defense. The unit is first in the league in points allowed per game (15.1) and yards allowed per game (267.4). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee Titans: FRecord entering Week 10: 1-8 (fourth place in AFC South)Tennessee still lives at the bottom of the NFL barrel, despite acquiring quarterback Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick this offseason. The situation around the former Miami Hurricane hasn't been ideal, with lackluster talent and a coaching staff that has already been upended with the firing of Brian Callahan earlier this year. The defense is allowing the third-most points per game (28.6), while the offense is scoring the fewest points per game in the league (14.4).  AFC West\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver Broncos: ARecord entering Week 10: 7-2 (first place in AFC West)The cardiac Broncos! Denver is currently tied for the longest winning streak in the NFL this season as the Broncos have ripped off six-straight victories to push them to 7-2. They are atop the AFC West, and they could very well be the No. 1 seed in the AFC had it not been for a bizarre leverage penalty called against them in last-second Week 2 loss to Indy. Regardless, this team has had a knack for coming alive in the fourth quarter, owning a +66 point differential in the final period. On top of that winning quotient, the defense has been among the best in the NFL, leading the league in sacks (40) and is the best on third down (28.2%) and in the red zone (34.8% touchdown rate).  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Chargers: B+Record entering Week 10: 6-3 (second place in AFC West)L.A. opened 2025 firing on all cylinders, ripping off three-straight wins against each of its division rivals. The Chargers cooled after that with a 1-3 record over the next month, but have recently stabilized. They wrapped up the first half of the year with back-to-back wins that brought them to 6-3 on the year and firmly in the playoff mix, and just a game behind the Broncos. Defensively, they are holding opponents to just 5.2 yards per play, which falls inside the top 10 in the league. L.A. also leads the NFL in total yards per game differential (+87.8), along with being the best third-down offense (49.2% conversion rate) in the league entering Week 10. While Justin Herbert has played well, the key question in the second half will be whether or not the offensive line can hold up with Joe Alt going down for the year. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs: CRecord entering Week 10: 5-4 (third place in AFC West)Kansas City remains the betting favorite to win Super Bowl LX, but that's largely based on reputation. In a vacuum, it's been up and down for them in 2025. The Chiefs began the year 0-2, losing to the Chargers in the opener and then the Eagles. They were able to claw back to .500 by ripping off back-to-back wins, but then had a puzzling defeat to the Jaguars to push them back down. More recently, the Chiefs looked like their old selves, averaging 29.6 points per game over a three-game winning streak between Week 6 and Week 8. As has been the theme, however, they came back down the earth in Week 9 in a loss to Buffalo, where Patrick Mahomes was sacked three times and hit 15 times. They are still well within range of making a Chiefs-like surge in the second half, but they'll need to be gangbusters out of the bye. To this point, it's been hot and cold. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders: DRecord entering Week 10: 2-6 (fourth place in AFC West)The Raiders acquired Geno Smith and hired Pete Carroll this offseason in hopes of boosting the organization to a more respectable level. That hasn't materialized. After pulling off a win in Week 1, Las Vegas lost four straight and six of its last seven, sitting at 2-6 on the year and well within last place in the AFC West. Part of the issue was the club missing offensive linchpin Brock Bowers, but Smith was also sloppy with the football. Meanwhile, the defense has started to falter. On the year, the unit is giving up 26.3 points per game (eighth highest in the NFL), but that has ticked up in the last two weeks, allowing 30.5 points per game. \n\n        \n            \n                One thing we learned about each NFL team halfway through 2025 season: Rams on fire; Steelers will hang around\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNFC East\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia Eagles: A-Record entering Week 10: 6-2 (first place in NFC East)For all the hemming and hawing surrounding the Eagles this season, they are still 6-2, in a strong position in the NFC East, and enter Week 10 as the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Yes, the passing attack has its warts, but the offense has committed just three turnovers this season (fewest in the NFL) and is the best red zone unit in the NFL with an 85% touchdown rate. Defensively, they had issues at outside corner and at edge rusher, but Howie Roseman did his best to address those concerns with deadline deals for corners Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander, along with pass rusher Jaelan Phillips. They should still be considered the team to beat in the NFC. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas Cowboys: C-Record entering Week 10: 3-5-1 (second place in NFC East)The Cowboys have a high-flying offense. They are tied for the third-highest yards per play total in the NFL, seventh in the league on third down (42.9% conversion rate), and are fourth in points per game (29.2). Throwing it around the yard and putting up points isn't what has them under .500. It's the defense. In essentially every key metric, they are in the bottom third in the NFL. They are just one of two teams (Bengals being the other), allowing over 30 points per game (30.8) this season. They are the only team allowing opponents to convert on third down more than half the time (league-worst 52.59%). Jerry Jones made deadline deals to try and help remedy that problem, bringing in linebacker Logan Wilson and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, but they have some ground to make up because of this lackluster unit. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington Commanders: DRecord entering Week 10: 3-6 (third place in NFC East)The Commanders have taken a considerable step backward after bursting onto the scene in Year 1 with Jayden Daniels. They've gone from an NFC Championship participant to a 3-6 club that is struggling to stay in the playoff picture. Of course, a key reason for their downtrodden 2025 campaign has been due to injuries, particularly with Daniels. He missed time due to a hamstring injury earlier in the year and is now on the shelf indefinitely following a gruesome elbow injury. While Daniels is a key driver for their lack of success, it isn't the only reason. Their defense has looked slow throughout the year and is allowing 6.2 yards per play (second-highest in the NFL) and an opposing passer rating of 110.7 (third-highest). They are currently on a four-game losing streak, which includes three-straight losses of 20 or more points entering Week 10. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants: C+Record entering Week 10: 2-7 (fourth place in NFC East)Yes, the record isn't good at 2-7, and the Giants again find themselves in last place in the NFC East. However, the No. 1 priority for the franchise was hitting on 2025 first-round pick Jaxson Dart, which it seems to have done. Since taking over as the starter over Russell Wilson, Dart has looked the part of a franchise centerpiece. He's led the Giants to their only two wins on the year (2-4 as a starter), while completing 62.3% of his throws, averaging 195.8 yards passing per game and 41.8 yards rushing per game. Dart also has 15 total touchdowns and just three interceptions. Most of that production has been without top wideout Malik Nabers, who went down with a season-ending ACL tear in late September. If you ask a Giants fan, the first half has been a success because of Dart's emergence, even if the record still isn't where they'd want it to be. NFC North\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay Packers: BRecord entering Week 10: 5-2-1 (first place in NFC North)The Packers looked unstoppable over the first two weeks of the regular season. They pulled off back-to-back wins over the Lions and Commanders, and the addition of Micah Parsons looked like it was going to make them the overwhelming Super Bowl favorite. After that, however, they came back down to earth in shocking fashion. They were upset on the road by the Cleveland Browns in Week 3 and then tied the Cowboys in Dallas after the defense gave up 40 points. That took the shine off the Cheeseheads, and it was restored briefly with a three-game winning streak, but subdued once more with another shocking upset loss in Week 9. There, they fell to the Carolina Panthers at Lambeau Field, where the offense mustered just 13 points in the losing effort. It does seem like they play up or play down to their competition, which is a frustrating development for such a talented club. It'll also be interesting to see how much the offense will be impacted in the second half following the season-ending injury to star tight end Tucker Kraft. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Lions: BRecord entering Week 10: 5-3 (second place in NFC North)The Lions are another team that has run a little hot and cold through the first half. They bounced back well after dropping the opener to Green Bay, rattling off four-straight wins and averaging 40.3 points per game in the process. However, they've more recently lost two of their last three, and the offensive production has been cut in half (21.7 points per game). Despite the up-and-down nature, Detroit remains one of the key players in the NFC, and Jared Goff continues to be efficient. He's second in the NFL in completion percentage (73.8%) and tied for second with a 2.1 passing touchdown per game average. Defensively, they are top 10 in the league in yards per play allowed (5.0), but are middle of the pack in points per game (22.3). \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago Bears: B-Record entering Week 10: 5-3 (third place in NFC North)The Bears are in the playoff mix at the midway point of the regular season, which is a fantastic development for Year 1 under Ben Johnson. Yes, they've largely beaten up on bad competition, but they've also shown resiliency, including last week's last-second victory over the Bengals, where Caleb Williams uncorked a 58-yard touchdown to Colston Loveland with less than 30 seconds to play in regulation. As expected, Johnson's arrival has seen the offensive production improve. Chicago has 36 plays of 20-plus yards this season (fifth in the NFL) after having 47 such plays last season (28th). The Bears are also averaging 378.4 yards per game (fourth-most in the NFL) and 26.9 points per game (sixth-most). Defensively, they need to improve as they rank 29th in the league, allowing 28.4 points per game. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Vikings: C+Record entering Week 10: 4-4 (fourth place in NFC North)Injuries at quarterback knocked the Vikings off kilter through the first half of the season. They began the year with a comeback win over the Bears, led by J.J. McCarthy, but then the second-year signal-caller struggled in a Week 2 blowout loss to the Falcons. After that, he was put on the shelf due to a high ankle sprain, which thrust Carson Wentz into the fold. Wentz was able to lead them to a 2-1 record before dropping his final two starts, where he was playing injured. In McCarthy's return last week, he led an upset win over the Lions in Detroit to claw Minnesota back to .500, and could be a wild card in this second half after staying afloat.NFC South\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tampa Bay Buccaneers: A-Record entering Week 10: 6-2 (first place in NFC South)The Bucs find themselves at 6-2 on the year and currently the No. 2 seed in the NFC at the halfway point of the regular season. Baker Mayfield has pushed this team well above .500 despite a slew of injuries. Out of the gate, he was without starting tackle Tristan Wirfs and wideout Chris Godwin, and other key figures like wideout Mike Evans and running back Bucky Irving have also missed considerable time. Part of that has been thanks to first-round rookie Emeka Egbuka bursting onto the scene, but he's been quiet over the last month, so they'll need to get healthy on that side of the ball. While the record itself is stellar, their losses to Philadelphia and Detroit do raise a small red flag. Overall, however, they are in a strong position for the second half. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Carolina Panthers: ARecord entering Week 10: 5-4 (second place in NFC South)The expectation for the Panthers was low entering 2025. Folks did not think they'd be a game behind the Buccaneers for first place in the division and in the hunt for a wild card spot to begin the year, but here we are. Carolina has already matched its win total from last season and is fresh off one of the biggest upsets of the season as they defeated the Packers at Lambeau Field. Rico Dowdle has been a diamond in the rough for them as the veteran back has taken the NFL by storm. His 735 yards rushing and 5.6 yards per carry rank third-highest in the league. It hasn't been perfect for the Panthers as they are averaging just 18.9 points per game (sixth-worst in the NFL), but to find themselves above .500 at this point when factoring in their expectations coming into the year deserves an \"A\" grade. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons: C+Record entering Week 10: 3-5 (third place in NFC South)Atlanta began the year with a 3-2 record, which included what in the moment felt like a statement victory over the Buffalo Bills at home in Week 6. From there, however, they've since dropped three straight to fall below .500. Within that losing streak were some offensive duds against San Francisco and then against Miami (with Kirk Cousins at quarterback). That inconsistency has made them a frustrating watch at times, especially when there are performances from Drake London and Bijan Robinson that take over games. Still, Atlanta is scoring just 17.9 points per game (28th in the NFL). Defensively, the Falcons are giving up the fewest passing yards per game (158.1) in the NFL entering Week 10, which again makes their record frustrating. If the pieces fall into place, there are the makings of a team that could go on a run, but the Falcons haven't consistently put together complete performances. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans Saints: DRecord entering Week 10: 1-8 (fourth place in NFC South)New Orleans was one of the favorites to be the worst team in the NFL in 2025, and they've kept themselves in the running for that through nine weeks. They were feisty at times in the early going (which helped them from receiving a failing grade), but they couldn't truly put teams on upset alert. Spencer Rattler went 1-7 as the starter before first-year coach Kellen Moore sent him to the bench in place of Tyler Shough for Week 9, but it didn't provide much of a spark as they were blown out by the Rams. The Saints defense is giving up 27 points per game (seventh-highest in the NFL), while the offense is barely mustering two touchdowns with a 15.3 points per game average (31st). They are in the early stages of what could be a long rebuild. NFC West\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Seahawks: ARecord entering Week 10: 6-2 (first place in NFC West)In the offseason, the swapping of Geno Smith for Sam Darnold at quarterback was looked at as a semi-improvement or maybe even a lateral move. Boy, was that off. Darnold has not only been able to replicate his late-career breakout with the Vikings in 2024 as he transitioned over to Seattle, but the veteran has been even better. Darnold's 9.6 yards per attempt average leads the league and is on pace to throw for over 4,400 yards this season. He also has 16 passing touchdowns and just five interceptions on a 116.0 passer rating so far. When you pair Darnold continuing to take the NFL by storm with a top-flight defense, the Seahawks are arguably the most balanced team in the NFL. They are No. 5 in the league in points per game (28.9) and points per game allowed (18.8). They are a sneaky Super Bowl contender. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams: ARecord entering Week 10: 6-2 (second place in NFC West)Matthew Stafford should be getting more MVP attention. The veteran is white hot at the halfway mark of the season, leading the NFL with 21 passing touchdowns. That number already exceeds his total from last season (20 passing touchdowns). Stafford has thrown 16 touchdowns over the last five games and has tossed zero interceptions over that stretch as well. That play gives L.A. a championship-caliber season, especially with the defense playing equally as well. The unit is allowing just 15.9 points per game this season, which is the second-best in the NFL. They are a major threat and feel a lot like their championship team from Super Bowl LVI. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ers: ARecord entering Week 10: 6-3 (third place in NFC West)This might be Kyle Shanahan's most impressive coaching performance. San Francisco has been ravaged by injuries to some of its most important players on the roster, and the coach still has them tied record-wise for first place in the NFC West. The Niners have lost Nick Bosa and Fred Warner for the year, and have been with Brock Purdy for most of the season as well. Mac Jones has filled in admirably at quarterback, owning a 5-2 record as the starter. That said, it's been Christian McCaffrey who has helped weather the storm offensively as the back leads the NFL in scrimmage yards with 1,222. Currently, McCaffrey is on pace for 1,125 yards rushing and 1,182 yards receiving this season. For reference, no player has had 1,100 rushing and receiving yards in a single season. It's a credit to their perseverance that they are still in a playoff position, but the key question for the second half is whether or not these injuries will start to catch up, particularly on defense. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Cardinals: C+Record entering Week 10: 3-5 (fourth place in NFC West)The Cardinals are one of seven teams to lead in every game this season, but they are the lone team of that bunch to be under .500 at the moment. Arizona's inability to close has been a problem in 2025, and has the Cardinals in a massive hole in what is a wildly competitive NFC West. Recently, the offense seems to have found a spark with Jacoby Brissett, who will remain the starter in Week 10. This represents a possible seismic moment for the organization. While Kyler Murray is currently dealing with a foot injury, coach Jonathan Gannon did tell Arizona Sports 98.7 FM that Brissett would've been named the starter this week even if Murray were healthy. That leaves plenty of questions for the long-term view of the Cardinals, but in terms of where they stand at the midway point, their five-straight one-score losses have them looking up at the rest of the division.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Adidas has embraced the spirit of tradition with its latest kit release, unveiling 22 home kits on Wednesday that the brand designed with the 2026 World Cup in mind.The drop includes the home kits for six nations who have already qualified for next summer's tournament, host nation Mexico and reigning world champions Argentina, as well as several World Cup hopefuls like Spain and Germany. It is the largest load of kits Adidas has ever designed for a World Cup, true to form for the biggest edition of the tournament after FIFA expanded the competition to include 48 teams.The new batch of kits are made from the lightest fabric Adidas has created, just in time for what could be the hottest World Cup on record.\"It's around Climacool+ and every federation is going to have an authentic kit so it's going to have that level of performance in the home and away kits,\" Mateo Kossman, Adidas football's senior product manager, told CBS Sports. \"In terms of performance, no compromise there and the fabric that we use is an engineered body-mapping 3D structure that, depending on the area of the body, depending on the fabric, allowing for better breathability for the jersey.\"\nBetween the creation of performance-focused fabric and the design itself, the layered process to create the World Cup kits took three years, requiring multiple steps of collaboration between Adidas and the federations before locking in the looks.\"The first year is the base style team who does the patterns of the jersey,\" Sergio Mareco, Adidas' senior designer of football apparel, said. \"They need to develop fabric, they need to develop new trims and then in the second year, we get the briefings from the federations so it's not that they take too long to design something. It's just more like the approvals so we design the jersey, we get the first approval, make the first sample so then the whole process takes three years.\"Adidas' design team takes a two-pronged approach to crafting the story of a kit, striking a balance between the team's on-field narratives and references to the nation the jersey represents. That process is easier for some teams than others -- take for example Argentina, who will return to the World Cup next year as the reigning champions. The brand blended the blue tones from the jerseys they wore each time they won the World Cup -- 1978, 1986 and 2022 -- for their latest look, staying true to the classic striped design while creating a physical embodiment of the national team's storied history.\n\n                                                                    Adidas\n                                                            The real challenge of designing a home jersey in a World Cup year, very simply, is that it's a World Cup year. Federations lean on tradition in these years more so than any other, increasing the difficulty on the task of creating a unique look.\"The federations, they are very clear that they need to be represented very, very clear when it comes to the colors of a World Cup,\" Kossman said. \"For example, when we work with Mexico -- we love working with Mexico because they have such a rich culture and they're not scared to try things, to explore all the colors that they have in their culture and we bring kits. We brought, for example, kits in '24 where we inspired ourselves in fantastic creatures from the Mexican culture and then we had a home kit that was burgundy with dark green details. ...  When you go to a World Cup, they're like, 'my home kit needs to be Mexican green.'

    "body": "\n        Late on Tuesday afternoon, just hours before the New Orleans Pelicans recorded their first win of the season, 116-112 over the Charlotte Hornets thanks to a fourth-quarter comeback, the team announced that star forward Zion Williamson would be out for at least a week with a hamstring strain. Losing a player of Williamson's caliber is never a good thing, particularly after an 0-6 start, but the silver lining was that it forced coach Willie Green to play rookie big man Derik Queen, who had strangely fallen out of the rotation. Entering Tuesday, Queen had seen his playing time decrease in each of the Pelicans' four previous games, and he only saw the floor for six minutes and 51 seconds of garbage time action against the Oklahoma City Thunder on SundayQueen, the No. 13 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, still only played 18 minutes against the Hornets, but he made his case to remain in the rotation long-term. He finished with 12 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and four steals on 5 of 7 from the field, and was instrumental in the comeback. His steal immediately after Jose Alvarado had hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 16 seconds remaining was one of the biggest plays of the night. \"[I saw] trust in his work,\" Alvarado said. \"I told him you're a rook, they're gonna be on your ass -- excuse my language. But just stay [true] to yourself, trust your work and that's what he did. He stuck with it. He turned the ball over three times and guess what, I told him he's gonna make a winning play. He got the winning steal\" \nQueen, who played the entire fourth quarter, had some rookie moments, including a hilarious long-range lob attempt from about 60 feet that resulted in a turnover, but he more than made up for them on both ends of the floor. He knocked down a few mid-range jumpers, showed off a deft touch around the rim and delivered some excellent passes. \nThe Hornets are not elite competition, and we don't know what the coaches were seeing behind closed doors. Even so, it didn't make sense that a big man with these kind of skills was barely getting on the floor for a winless team. It's not as if the Pelicans have some sort of dynamite frontcourt. DeAndre Jordan was on his couch when the season began and he started a game for them last week. Queen being glued to the bench was even more bizarre given the steep price the Pelicans paid to draft him in June. \nVice president of basketball operations Joe Dumars gave the Indiana Pacers their 2026 first-round pick back in exchange for the No. 23 pick in the 2025 draft, then sent No. 23 (Asa Newell) and an unprotected 2026 first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks for the No. 13 pick, which they used to select Queen. The series of transactions was widely panned, and there were even rumors at the time that the Hawks' front office was so bewildered by their good fortune that they called Dumars multiple times to make sure the 2026 pick really was unprotected. The Pelicans and Pacers have the second- and fourth-worst records in the league, respectively. Come next June, there's a good chance that Dumars will have traded away two top-10 picks in the 2026 draft -- already being heralded for the wealth of talent at the top of the class -- for Queen. The nature of Queen's arrival in New Orleans has placed an unfair amount of pressure on the 20-year-old, but he must be given a chance to prove himself, even once Williamson comes back. At this point, what do the Pelicans have to lose? \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Memphis Grizzlies may not yet be ready to trade Ja Morant, but the NBA, to this point, doesn't seem especially enthusiastic about the idea that they soon might. On Monday's episode of the Hoop Collective Podcast, ESPN's Tim MacMahon asked if there would be a robust trade market for Morant, and Tim Bontemps indicated that he did not believe there would be. On Tuesday, ESPN's Marc Spears chimed in as well and echoed those sentiments.\"I talked to a couple of GMs who told me that last summer, every player on the Grizzlies were available for trade,\" Spears said. \"That includes Ja and Jaren [Jackson]. Certainly curious to me that the Orlando Magic were able to make a trade with the Grizzlies, they got Desmond Bane, which it made it apparent that they could have gotten Ja Morant and decided not to.\"Four of the execs said they really have no interest in trading for Morant. One said it was because of a combo of contract and off-the-court issues. Another suggested that if Ja is traded, it'll probably be a problem star for a problem star. A couple of them also said that you need the right coaching staff to have such a mercurial star as him. And I asked one current NBA coach if he would like to coach Ja Morant, and he said 'I'm not sure I'd want to.'\"Given Morant's credentials, it's worth exploring why exactly so few teams seem interested in trading for him. The explanations Spears were offered are part of the equation, obviously. Morant is set to make max money not only this season, but for the next two afterward. His off-court issues speak for themselves. He's been suspended for a total of 34 games, and his absences haven't been limited to suspensions. \nMorant misses games due to injury frequently. For his career, he's missed around 35% of all regular-season Grizzlies games. Those injuries have added up. There is pretty meaningful statistical evidence that Morant is declining, especially in the areas most important for his playing style. He's not getting to the rim as much. He's not getting to the line as much. As a result, he isn't scoring as much.\n        \n            \n                Ja Morant doesn't want his minutes messed with, but his declining production no longer warrants superstar say\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAgain, these explanations are all valid parts of a greater whole. But there's another factor holding Morant's trade value down that's getting lost in the shuffle, one that would affect him regardless of his recent controversies. It is simply hard to trade small, ball-dominant guards right now.Take Trae Young as a similar example. The Atlanta Hawks traded Dejounte Murray in the 2024 offseason, but according to MacMahon on another episode of the Hoop Collective, he wasn't the only guard they considered moving. \"The simple fact of the matter is that if there was a real market for Trae Young, he'd be somewhere else right now,\" he said at the time. He's far from the only example of this phenomenon.\nWhen James Harden was traded early in the 2023-24 season, he netted Philadelphia one very good unprotected first-round pick from the Clippers, one very bad \"least favorable of three teams\" first-round pick from the Thunder and a protected first-round swap from the Clippers. When Damian Lillard got traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, he netted two unprotected picks, one unprotected swap, and Jrue Holiday, who would himself later be traded for picks. Between them, they'd been selected to 19 All-Star Games at the time of those trades. Mikal Bridges has never made one, and he alone netted five first-round picks along with one first-round swap. Rudy Gobert is obviously a bit more accomplished than that, but he's far less accomplished than Harden and Lillard. He, too, got five first-round picks and a swap if you count Walker Kessler, who hadn't played yet at the time.Every trade is unique. This isn't the stock market, where value is fixed and you can click \"trade\" when a player's price hits a low enough level. Age, health, contract, personality and circumstances for the teams involved all play into what someone gets on the market. But recent history suggests that high-usage point guards get less than you'd think while wings almost always get more (we haven't even mentioned Paul George yet) and bigs can under the right circumstances as well. So why is that?Because, where most point guards are concerned, almost all of their value is derived from what they do when they have the ball in their hands. Their size and offensive workload limit what the can do defensively. While they may be capable shooters, they are very often better off the dribble than they are off the catch, making them less valuable off-ball players. They likely haven't done much cutting or screening in their careers because of how high their usage has been. There's nothing wrong with these kinds of players. It's just that most of the best teams already have them, and when they don't, it's because they have bigger players already running their offense. And usually, it's the best teams that want to pay substantial prices for All-Stars on the trade market.\nTake the Knicks here, as they traded all of those picks for Bridges. Why would they want Morant when they already have Jalen Brunson? Morant's poor shooting would limit his spacing. His small stature would make it harder for the Knicks to defend. Roll down the list of contenders. The Thunder have Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Cavaliers have Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland. The 76ers have Tyrese Maxey, VJ Edgecombe, Jared McCain and Quentin Grimes fighting for touches. The Lakers have Luka Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves. The Nuggets have Jamal Murray and run their offense through a center in Nikola Jokić. Morant doesn't make sense for teams like that. Even teams that need guards don't really need a Morant-esque guard. Think about Houston. Could the Rockets make a big swing for a guard this season? Yes. But Kevin Durant is already their half-court shotmaker, Alperen Sengun handles the ball more than most bigs and Amen Thompson is a younger, healthier and more versatile version of the \"elite athlete that can't really shoot but puts a ton of pressure on the rim\" archetype. Morant doesn't fit there either. The basketball world panicked when Damian Lillard tore his Achilles last spring thinking the Bucks would be dead in the water without a high-level guard scorer. It turns out, they've been just fine operating on the cheap. Ryan Rollins is averaging around 83% of Morant's points at around 10% of the salary. Cole Anthony hasn't been far off and he's making the minimum. You can find guard scoring relatively cheaply on the free agent market. Supply outpaces demand, and it allows teams to be a bit pickier stylistically. The Bucks need shooters around Giannis Antetokounmpo more than anything, so Morant obviously doesn't qualify.\nSpears brought up the Magic in his reporting. They probably could have traded for Morant if they'd offered the Grizzlies what they gave up for Desmond Bane. But think of why the Magic wanted Bane, specifically. They've been at the bottom of the league in terms of 3-point shooting for years. They have a defense-first culture that they didn't want to mess with. And they needed someone who could boost their offense without taking the ball out of the hands of their young franchise players, Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. Bane checks all three boxes. Morant checks none of them. Even if Morant is the more acclaimed player of the two, Bane is the one that's far easier to fit onto an existing roster. And that's the key to all of this. Ja Morant isn't the sort of player that can or should be plopped down onto just any roster. He only makes sense somewhere that is willing to build its entire program around his strengths and weaknesses. And that brings us to the team that gets thrown around more often than any other in fake trade talks: Sacramento. While the Sacramento Bee's Jason Anderson reported that the Kings haven't yet engaged the Grizzlies in trade talks, they should be expected to monitor the situation as it progresses.On the surface, the Kings are a questionable fit. They already have a bunch of high-usage ball-handlers that don't really shoot like Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan and Dennis Schröder. But Sacramento's interest, should it arise, would be bigger picture. Westbrook is on a non-guaranteed minimum deal, DeRozan is only partially guaranteed for next season, and Schröder is only making mid-level money and has been a backup for much of his career. They aren't exactly standing in anyone's way if changes need to be made.\nWhen the Kings broke their playoff drought in 2023, they did so by pairing Domantas Sabonis with one of the NBA's speediest point guards in De'Aaron Fox. Morant could replicate parts of that formula. He could be the primary ball-handler for the Kings. There seemingly aren't that many other teams out there eager to replace their current primary ball-handler with Morant, and the only way for Morant to justify his max salary, regardless of injuries or controversies, is to be someone's primary ball-handler and run a high-level offense. He's not going to do it on defense and he's not going to do it as a shooter. Hence, teams like the Kings are going to make up the lion's share of the market unless a contender decides to roll the dice.Trade value is a tricky concept. How \"good\" a player is only accounts for a small part of it. The smartest teams think about possible acquisitions in a more nuanced way. It's about the whole, not the value of the individual parts. The best version of Morant was so good that many teams would eagerly make him their focal point and build the whole to his strengths. The version of him we're seeing now doesn't seem worth it. If Morant is merely going to be a good on-ball scorer rather than an elite driver whose gravity generates consistently easy shots for everyone else, his fit on most existing rosters is going to be so iffy that the Grizzlies probably would struggle to find a palatable trade.That, more than even the equity he's built up in Memphis, is probably the biggest reason a trade is unlikely for the time being. The Grizzlies have already built their whole organization around Morant. The theoretical best version of him is more valuable to them than the real one we're seeing on the court would be for the majority of teams. A trade makes sense when a player's trade value to the league exceeds his actual value to his current team. Considering how low Morant's trade value has seemingly sunk, the Grizzlies probably don't think that's close to the case yet, so things are probably going to have to get worse before a trade becomes realistic.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The AL champion Toronto Blue Jays have one fewer item on their offseason to-do list. Right-hander Shane Bieber has exercised his $16 million player option and stay with the club for 2026, the team announced Wednesday. Bieber would have received a $4 million buyout had he declined the player option, so it was a $12 million decision. Getting Bieber back on the player option is a very good outcome for Toronto. It's an affordable salary, it's a short-term commitment, and it's reasonable to believe he will be more effective as he gets further away from elbow reconstruction. The Blue Jays don't need Bieber to be an ace or even a No. 2 starter. He's more than qualified to be a No. 3, and has a chance to be even more.Our R.J. Anderson ranked Bieber as the 13th-best free agent available this offseason. Now he's off the market. Here's the write-up: Bieber returned from Tommy John surgery late in the season,  showcasing a strong handle over an average arsenal. His fastball did  clock in hotter than it has since 2021, and his slider at times flashed  above-average quality. The most interesting development here, though,  concerned a freshly minted kick-changeup that graded better than its  results. Bieber ought to find success for as long as he can locate, but  he's more of a mid-rotation starter than a frontline type. \tBieber, 30, joined Toronto in a deadline trade with the Cleveland Guardians. He was rehabbing from Tommy John surgery at the time. Bieber made seven regular season starts with the Blue Jays, pitching to a 3.57 ERA with 37 strikeouts in 40 ⅓ innings. He had a 3.86 ERA in 18 ⅔ postseasons inning during Toronto's run to the American League pennant. \nIn Game 7 of the World Series, Bieber came out of the bullpen and surrendered Will Smith's game-winning 11th inning solo homer. It was his first relief appearance since 2019. Veteran righties Chris Bassitt and Max Scherzer, who combined to make 48 starts in 2025, are free agents this offseason. Bieber picking up his player option means the Blue Jays have one less rotation spot to worry about. With an entire offseason to go, Toronto's 2026 rotation depth chart currently looks like this: RHP Kevin GausmanRHP Trey YesavageRHP Shane BieberRHP José Berríos (missed the postseason with an elbow injury)LHP Eric LauerRHP Bowden Francis (did not pitch after June 14 due to shoulder injury)LHP Easton LucasThe Blue Jays have not provided an update on Berríos, who made at least 30 starts every year from 2022-25, since he was shut down for the postseason in September. Even if his injury will not cut into his availability next year, it would make sense for Toronto to pursue a starting pitcher this winter. If Berríos will miss the start of 2026, another starter will be imperative. \nIn addition to addressing the rotation, the Blue Jays will have to either re-sign or replace shortstop Bo Bichette, our third ranked free agent. Bullpen help figures to be a priority as well. Toronto went 94-68 this season and was the AL's No. 1 seed. They lost the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven thrilling games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dodgers are World Series champions and the 2025-26 offseason is underway. We're  still waiting for the first significant free-agent signing or trade, which isn't unusual less than a week into the offseason. Give it another week or so and the action will pick up. Before the hot stove really gets burning, here are 10 bold predictions for the 2025-26 offseason. Last offseason's bold predictions were OK. Feel free to mock this year's, but remember, all geniuses were called crazy at first.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       1. Bo stays in Toronto   This one feels like such a lay up that I feel stupid calling it a \"bold\" prediction. The Blue Jays just went the World Series and World Series teams tend to re-sign their own free agents at a higher rate than non-World Series teams. Bichette has also said repeatedly that he wants to stay in Toronto long-term (like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. said before his extension). So, I will kick off our hot stove bold predictions by predicting Bichette re-signs with the Blue Jays. Let's call it an eight-year deal in the $250 million range. Also, a sub-bold prediction: Bichette moves to second base next year. He played there in the World Series because a knee injury limited his mobility, though he was a poor defensive shortstop even with a healthy knee. Bichette at second and Andrés Giménez at short is the middle infield of the future in Toronto.      2. Tucker's contract will be closer to $500 million than $400 million   \nThis is just another way of saying the check clears north of $450 million. Kyle Tucker, this offseason's No. 1 free agent, is one of the game's top all-around outfielders and all the right teams (i.e. big-market contenders) need an impact outfielder. The Cubs, Dodgers, Giants, and Yankees will all assuredly be in the mix and you needn't try hard to see how the Blue Jays, Mets, and Phillies could make it work. Tucker won't get a Juan Soto contract because he's older and not as good, but he is very good, and he will play the entire 2026 season at age 29. Whichever team signs him will get a lot of peak years. This bold prediction says Tucker signs for north of $450 million, likely across at least 12 years. (Also, just to cover our bases: $450 million will be total before any deferrals.)   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       3. Skubal stays put, signs long-term   I think there is a real chance Tarik Skubal gets traded this offseason. I wouldn't call it likely, but it could happen. Let's call it a 20% chance of a trade, and 20% is not 0%. This next prediction says the other 80% will play out and the Tigers will keep him. The bold part of the prediction calls for Skubal signing a long-term deal to stay in Detroit rather than becoming a free agent next offseason. He's a Scott Boras client and Boras loves to take his top clients out into free agency, but they do sometimes sign extensions, and I'm saying Skubal joins that group this offseason. The two sides were said to be $250 million apart in talks last winter. They'll bridge it this offseason. Let's go with a nine-year deal worth $350 million with an opt out after the third year. The $350 million would be the largest pitcher contract ever (something Boras surely wants), beating out Yoshinobu Yamamoto's $325 million contract with the Dodgers.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       4. Alonso and Bregman trade places   Not get traded for each other, but trade teams. Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman will both opt out of their contracts this winter and try to get the long-term deal they failed to get last winter. I'd say Bregman returning to the Red Sox is more likely than Alonso returning to the Mets, but who really knows? For this bold prediction, I say they swap places. Bregman goes to the Mets (and Mark Vientos slides over to first base) and Alonso goes to the Red Sox (and Triston Casas becomes a trade candidate). The Mets need help at the hot corner and must improve their infield defense. The Red Sox need a middle-of-the-order power threat, preferably a righty who can launch balls over the Green Monster. Bregman to the Mets and Alonso the Red Sox are fits every which way.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       5. Arenado heads to Philly   The Phillies seem determined to shake up their offense this offseason but they have only so many movable parts. Bryce Harper isn't going anywhere, Nick Castellanos is untradeable, and Trea Turner is not the problem. Third base is one position they could easily make a move, and I boldly predict that move involves shipping Alec Bohm elsewhere and bringing in a heavily subsidized Nolan Arenado to take over at the hot corner. The Cardinals did a whole farewell thing for Arenado's final home game and Phillies POBO Dave Dombrowski strikes me as the type to go after the fiery veteran. I'm not saying the Phillies will take on the entire $32 million the Cardinals still owed Arenado or that they'll send St. Louis a big package of prospects. The Cardinals will eat a bunch of money and take back two or three Grade C prospects, but it'll get done, and Arenado will man third base in Philadelphia in 2026 and 2027.    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       6. The Yankees reunite with King   The Yankees didn't want to trade Michael King two offseasons ago, but to get Juan Soto, that's what it took, so they traded him. King, after one excellent season and one good/injured season with the Padres, is a free agent this winter, giving the Yankees an opportunity to bring back a pitcher they never wanted to part with in the first place. It would not be just a feel-good story either. The Yankees need rotation help with Gerrit Cole (Tommy John), Carlos Rodón (loose bodies), and Clarke Schmidt (Tommy John) all set to begin next season on the injured list following elbow surgery. King does not figure to get a big long-term contract given his age (31 in May) and this year's shoulder/knee injuries, which fits for the Yankees, who already have several big pitcher contracts. We can't call it a homecoming because King is not a native New Yorker, but it will be a reunion. I boldly predict it.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n       7. The Marlins keep Alcantara (again)   At this time last year, I would have been stunned if you told me Sandy Alcantara would still be a Marlin in November 2025, but here we are. The Marlins didn't trade him last offseason and they didn't trade him at this year's deadline despite a lot of interest. Alcantara finished the season well, though he still wasn't back to his Cy Young self, and he might never get back there. He's a few years older now (turned 30 in September) and he has a new elbow ligament. Lots of guys have one or two Cy Young-caliber years and never get back to that level while remaining very good pitchers. Anyway, this bold prediction says the Marlins will again keep Alcantara this offseason even though conditions have never seemed riper for a trade. He's healthy, he finished the year well, and he's inching closer to free agency (one year plus one club option remaining on his contract). Now's the time to trade him. Instead, I'll say the Marlins hang on to Alcantara and hope a more robust trade market develops at next summer's trade deadline.      8. Cease settles for a one-year contract   \nIt is an annual occurrence now that a highly regarded free agent or three has to settle for a one-year contract, or really a one-year contract with multiple player options a la Alonso and Bregman last year, Cody Bellinger and Blake Snell the year before, etc. The case can be made Dylan Cease is the top free-agent pitcher on the market this winter thanks to his elite bat-missing stuff and top-notch durability (he's the only pitcher to make at least 32 starts every year from 2021-25). But also, his performance is so unpredictable year to year, and he will turn 30 next month. Cease is no longer a young pitcher trying to figure things out. I can see a lot of teams wanting him for one or two or even three years, but not five or six or seven. So that's the next bold prediction. Cease is the touted free agent who doesn't get a long-term deal and has to take a one-year contract with player options. It has been foretold.   9. Suárez gets more than Valdez   Let's do the ol' blind player comparison, one of the internet's oldest tricks. One of these guys is Framber Valdez and the other is Ranger Suárez, both of whom are free agents this offseason. These are 2024-25 numbers:   \n   Pitcher APitcher BIP \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t368 ⅓ \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t308 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tERA \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.30 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.33 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\txERA (what's this?) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.59 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.39 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tFIP \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.31 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.29 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tWAR \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t7.7 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t7.5 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tDo you know who's who? Pitcher A is Valdez and Pitcher B is Suárez. Their performance has been very similar the last two years on a rate basis, with Valdez having an edge in innings because Suárez missed time with back stiffness this year and last. You've got two statistically and stylistically similar lefties, except one will be 32 on Opening Day (Valdez) while the other will play most of 2026 at age 30 (Suárez). Perhaps is not bold then to predict Suárez will sign for more total dollars than Valdez, though I get the sense the perception is Valdez is the superior pitcher. I'm not so sure. I boldly predict Suárez beats Valdez's contract, possibly by a significant margin.      10. A long shot will win the draft lottery   A long shot has won the lottery the last two years. The Guardians, with 2.0% odds for the No. 1 pick, moved up from No. 9 to No. 1 in the 2024 Draft. Last year, the Nationals won the lottery with 10.2% odds, though they moved up only three spots. My final offseason bold prediction says a team will get Guardians-level luck and win the lottery despite holding 2.0% odds or worse for the No. 1 pick. That means it will be one of seven teams: Astros, Diamondbacks, Giants, Marlins, Mets, Rangers, or Royals. I'm feeling the Rangers. Don't ask me why. Just a feeling. Texas has 1.34% odds at the No. 1 pick in the 2026 Draft and would move up from the No. 11 pick if (or should I say when) they become the third long shot in three years to win the lottery.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- After a disappointing 3-5-1 start to the 2025 season, the Dallas Cowboys' Week 10 bye week came at the perfect time. Why is that? Because it allowed for whoever Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones had lined up to acquire in a potential trade ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline to have a week to acclimate themselves with Dallas' personnel and playbook.Jones decided to go \"all-in\" for real at the 2025 trade deadline: he first traded a seventh-round pick for Cincinnati Bengals Logan Wilson Tuesday morning before the main event Tuesday afternoon -- trading for 27-year-old, All-Pro New York Jets defensive tackle Quinnen Williams. He sent the Jets a 2026 second-round pick, the better one of the Cowboys' and Packers' 2027 first-round picks and 2023 first-round pick in defensive tackle Mazi Smith on Tuesday in exchange for Williams. That makes the timing of Dallas' bye week in Week 10 just right. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott reminisced about Dallas acquiring wide receiver Amari Cooper over their Week 8 bye back in the 2018 season following a 3-4 start to the season after the team's 27-17 loss on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 9. The Cowboys won seven of their final nine regular season games in 2018 en route to a 10-6 finish, good for an NFC East crown.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline winners and losers: Jets smartly stockpile for overhaul; Colts, Cowboys overpay?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Yeah, especially if it's a big value guy who's going to come in and make a difference and be an impact, you can do so much good [over the bye]. I've been a part of one of those, I don't know how many years ago it was, but it was Amari Cooper. Signing him on the bye week or going into the bye week, and we were able to get something going a few weeks later,\" Prescott said postgame on Monday. \"I know we lost the first week we had him on Monday night, but we ended up getting it back rolling and put together a streak. That's what this league's about: creating streaks. Win streaks and getting hot and putting yourself in a better position than you were at this moment. That's still in front of us. A lot of games left to be played. and we can still get a streak going.  Obviously, that would help, but I think as important as that, as anything, is us getting some answers to these issues that we have and getting healthy.\" \nThat was a measured, thoughtful answer from Prescott on the importance of having the bye line up with the trade deadline. After running into him in the Cowboys' locker room on Tuesday afternoon after the trade for Williams, Prescott had a more fired up, off the cuff reaction to the news that the All-Pro defensive tackle is going to become his newest teammate.\"F---ing pumped, you can quote me on that,\" Prescott said Tuesday.\"I think it's just going to add more playmaking ability to the d-line,\" Cowboys defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa said Tuesday. \"Another bullet in the gun. Another very strong, and talented guy, so I think we'll be able to use him. ... I've seen his tape. I respect his game a lot. He's a baller, so I'm excited to have him on the team.\"  Could the addition of Williams help power a similar push from the Cowboys going under .500 to a spot in the NFL postseason like Cooper's arrival did in 2018? Let's take a look at Dallas' remaining schedule and how they could potentially make legitimate effort to reach the postseason. \nRemaining scheduleDallas currently ranks 21st out of the NFL's 32 teams in terms of odds to make the playoffs at +710 according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The Cowboys' second-half schedule entering Week 10 ranks as the 12th-easiest remaining schedule in the NFL, per Tankathon, so there is opportunity. A problem with how it's laid out is the desired winning streak Prescott mentioned won't be easy to cobble together.  FanDuel currently lists the Cowboys as 3.5-point road favorites at the Las Vegas Raiders in their first game out of the bye in Week 11, but then Dallas has a stretch of six games in a row against playoff teams from a season ago starting in Week 12 against the Philadelphia Eagles through Week 17 at the Washington Commanders. Washington doesn't look nearly as intimidating with 2024 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels dislocating his left elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. WEEKDateOPPONENT (Record)KICKOFF TIME (ET)NETWORK10Nov. 10BYEN/AN/A11Nov. 17at Raiders* (2-6)8:15 p.m.  ESPN12Nov. 23vs. Eagles (6-2)4:25 p.m.FOX13Nov. 27vs. Chiefs*** (5-4)4:30 p.m.CBS14Dec. 4at Lions** (5-3)8:15 p.m.Prime Video15Dec. 14vs. Vikings (4-4)8:20 p.m.NBC16Dec. 21vs. Chargers (6-3)1 p.m.    FOX17Dec. 25at Commanders**** (3-6)1 p.m.Netflix18Jan. 3/4at New York Giants (2-7)TBDTBD* Monday night** Thursday night*** Thanksgiving                                                                                                                                                                                        **** Christmas DayPlayoff push formulaOffensively, Dallas has it what needs to be a playoff-caliber squad, ranking as the fourth-best scoring offense (29.2 points per game) in the entire league. Prescott ranks fourth in the NFL in passing yards (2,319) and tied for third in passing touchdowns (17). Running back Javonte Williams' is the NFL's fourth-leading rusher (716 yards rushing) while his eight rushing touchdowns are the third-most in the league. Wide receiver George Pickens' 764 yards receiving are the third-most in football while his six receiving touchdowns are tied for the fourth-most in the NFL. Tight end Jake Ferguson's 56 catches are the sixth-most in the league while his six receiving touchdowns are tied for the fourth-most in football with Pickens and others. Dallas has all the offensive firepower it needs. They'll need steadier play from second-year left tackle Tyler Guyton (25 quarterback pressures allowed, tied for the sixth-most in the NFL) and veteran right tackle Terence Steele (22 quarterback pressures allowed, tied for the 13th-most in the NFL). However, Dallas is surrendering just the 10th-fewest overall quarterback pressure (34.2%), some of which can definitely be attributed to Prescott getting the ball out quickly. Overall, the offense is in good hands.Through nine weeks, Dallas has been a defensive disaster, surrendering 30.8 points per game -- the second-most in the NFL. No team has ever made the postseason in NFL history when allowing 30 or more points per game in a season, so clearly change has to occur. Swapping in Wilson in the slot occupied by underachieving veterans like Kenneth Murray and Jack Sanborn should be a marginal upgrade, and Williams should increase Dallas' finishing ability when it comes to pass rushing. The Cowboys already ranked as a top 10 unit in quarterback pressure rate without Williams -- 39.8%, the ninth-best in the NFL. A big difference could come in Dallas' ability to convert more pressures into sacks as their 20 team sacks in 2025 rank slightly below league average, tied for 17th. The Cowboys' secondary remains battered by numerous injuries at both their safety and cornerback positions, but help is on the way. Third-round rookie cornerback Shavon Revel could make his NFL debut in Week 11 at the Raiders, per Schottenheimer, and explosive linebacker DeMarvion Overshown is also trending toward for a Week 11 return. Safeties Donovan Wilson (elbow/shoulder) and Juanyeh Thomas (migraines) could also be back after the bye. Overall, the pass gameplan in Dallas is to do what they did with Parsons once again with Williams: create so much quarterback pressure that opponents don't have enough time or options to carve them up through the air. The Cowboys led the NFL with a team quarterback pressure rate of 40.2% with Parsons on board from 2021 to 2024. In 2025, Dallas is currently allowing 254.4 passing yards per game, the third-most in the NFL. \"Well, it [adding Williams] should hopefully allow for less time for the quarterback to stand back there and see what's going on. What it does is creates one-on-ones. There's no way to slide. If you're in a four-down front, we can send the center one way or the other. When you have five guys out there, you can't send the center anywhere,\" Schottenheimer said. \"So your help will have to come from somewhere. Usually, you use a back. When you use a back, it limits how freely you can use that back. It creates a lot of problems honestly.\"Williams can also be a difference maker against the run as his 13 runs stuffs for a loss or no gain are the second-most in the NFL this season, according to Next Gen Stats via NFL Research.  Dallas' 143.0 rushing yards per game allowed this season are the fourth-most in the league. \"[Cowboys defensive line coach Aaron] Whitecotten said he's just an incredible all-around player, but he said that [Williams is] one of the best run stoppers he's ever been around,\" Schottenheimer said. \"It's because of the relentless play style that he has, the way he's wired. I think that's something he's shown coming out of college and through his first couple of years in the league.\"   The hope for Dallas to make the playoffs is that the defensive reinforcements in tandem with their top flight offense will be enough to get hot and go on a winning streak against a heavily backloaded schedule. Thanks to the up-and-down first half of 2025, the Cowboys are walking a tightrope with no margin for error the rest of the way. It's improbably but still within a remote realm of possibility coming out of their bye in Week 11. \"No question... we don't have room for error. We are in a situation now where every game is critical, and we got to win the game. It starts by figuring some stuff out this week from a self-scout standpoint,\" Schottenheimer said. \"That's where the focus is right now. The players are going to kind of reset, recharge, but we've got a week to figure out a lot of things. Also now, how to use and acclimate these [new] guys to the team.\"   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        College football's sprint to the finish line in the playoff race begins this weekend with several matchups involving top-25 competition that are sure to spike how the CFP selection committee handicaps their rankings moving forward.Unbeaten BYU's trek to Lubbock to battle Texas Tech is a heavyweight showdown in the Big 12 that determines the league's playoff frontrunner down the stretch. Oregon's tough road game at Iowa is a show-me opportunity for the Ducks, whose lack of quality wins are a major talking point.In our latest installment of weekly predictions, numerous games are highlighted by multi-touchdown spreads, which means if your appetite's increasing for a colossal upset, you could be in luck.Last week's results: Brad Crawford (6-4, 5-5 ATS); Chris Hummer (6-4, 4-6). Gunner Stockton's kneel down at the 1-yard line in the final moments of Georgia's win over Florida is unforgivable if you had the Bulldogs covering, like we did. That one hurt. Hummer's pick of NC State covering (and winning) against Georgia Tech was a good one and I picked up a game in the standings with Texas outlasting Vanderbilt.\nSeason results: Crawford (71-29 straight, 52-48 ATS); Hummer (73-27; 48-52).For clarity, these lines were taken from FanDuel Sportsbook on Nov. 3. New users at FanDuel Sportsbook get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.No. 7 BYU at No. 8 Texas Tech\nHummer (Texas Tech -10.5): BYU is good. The Cougars are also fortunate to be unbeaten given how they've squeaked out wins. Texas Tech, for its part, is dominant when quarterback Behren Morton starts. Combine those factors with this being a win-or-miss-the-Big 12-Championship game for the Red Raiders, and I'm going to pick the home team. I'm also going to pick them to cover. That's a lot of points. But the Red Raiders haven't played a game within 20 points that Morton started. They continue that streak against the Cougars and a true freshman QB. … Texas Tech 34, BYU 20.Crawford (BYU +10.5): This line's daring me to take the unbeaten Cougars with the points and against my better judgment, I'm going to do it. Continuing to fade BYU this season is bad juju and I think Kalani Sitake's team is out to prove a point this weekend. That doesn't mean they're going to win, but I like BYU keeping it within the number. ... Texas Tech 31, BYU 24.\nNo. 2 Indiana at Penn State\nHummer (Penn State +13.5): This will be an interesting game for Indiana. Other than Oregon and perhaps Iowa, Penn State is the most talented team the Hoosiers have played this season. The Nittany Lions may have lost five straight, but you saw in the way they pushed Ohio State for a half that they're still competitive. The advanced stats lean Indiana in this game. I don't think this game is in question straight up. But I do think PSU is playing well enough and is talented enough up front to keep this close. Penn State covers if it can avoid crippling turnovers. … Indiana 35, Penn State 24.Crawford (Indiana -13.5): Let's roll with the Hoosiers again. They're one of the two best teams in the country regardless of where you think they should be in the polls up to this point and play to a standard all other coaches covet. Fernando Mendoza is one of the Heisman frontrunners for a reason and should have a stellar day inside Beaver Stadium. ... Indiana 38, Penn State 17.No. 9 Oregon at No. 20 Iowa \nHummer (Iowa +5.5): This is a fascinating matchup of Oregon's speed with Iowa's physicality and line of scrimmage play. The Ducks are a good team in the trenches. But they're not elite. There's a world where Iowa controls the line of scrimmage on Saturday. But can the Hawkeyes shorten the game enough to keep the scoring close? I think they do for a good stretch of the game. It's tough to play at Kinnick Stadium, and Iowa thrives on running the ball and controlling the clock. I'm not picking Iowa outright. I don't trust a surging Hawkeyes offense quite that much. But give me the cover. … Oregon 24, Iowa 20.\nCrawford (Oregon -5.5): Assuming the Ducks play up to the competition here and generate a few explosives in the passing game, Oregon should cover. That said, Dan Lanning's squad doesn't have a single win this season over a team inside the top 40 of the Massey Ratings, so they're untested a bit outside of that home loss to Indiana. We're going to see if Oregon is a legitimate playoff team this weekend or if it has gotten there based on brand alone through 10 weeks. ... Oregon 30, Iowa 17.Watch Oregon vs. Iowa live Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming live on CBSSports.com, the CBS Sports App and Paramount+ Premium.No. 5 Georgia at Mississippi State\nHummer (Georgia -7.5): Georgia's lived on the edge this season in SEC play. The Bulldogs of Athens have played six SEC games and five of them have been decided by 10 points or fewer. Georgia starts slow and lacks the elite defense they've had in past seasons. Mississippi State, for its part, is more competitive than it's been in years. But I still feel like there's a big talent gap in this game, and I trust Georgia to go on the road and handle the environment in Starkville. ... Georgia 34, Mississippi State 24.\nCrawford (Georgia -7.5): Mississippi State snapped its 16-game SEC losing skid last week at Arkansas, much needed positivity for second-year coach Jeff Lebby and his hopes of turning things around in Starkville. Now, this weekend's home game should include quite a few red-clan Dawgs fans, so the environment might not be as intimidating as most road venues in the SEC. Georgia has to avoid looking past this one against a hungry, now confident, football team. ... Georgia 27, Mississippi State 17.No. 3 Texas A&M at No. 22 Missouri\nHummer (Missouri +6.5): Everything we've seen from Missouri this year tells you this should be a cover and maybe an upset. The Tigers are excellent in the trenches, run the ball exceptionally well and have the benefit of coming off a bye. The problem is I don't know what true freshman quarterback Matt Zollers will look like being thrust into action. But I still like the Tigers to make this close. Zollers showed a lot of poise when inserted against Vanderbilt, and the Aggies have been occasionally gettable on defense. The Aggies remain unbeaten, but Missouri keeps it close enough. … Texas A&M 34, Missouri 28.Crawford (Texas A&M -6.5): Missouri has Texas A&M's full attention. While this game likely gets the \"trap game\" connotation elsewhere, you're not going to find that here. It's a road game in the SEC and Aggies coach Mike Elko knows his team will need to play their best to take out a well-coached, defensive-minded squad under Eli Drinkwitz. The SEC's lone remaining unbeaten runs its streak to nine and moves closer to No. 1. ... Texas A&M 28, Missouri 14.\nFlorida State at Clemson\nHummer (Clemson -2): This would have been a banger just a couple of years ago. Instead, this is a matchup of two disappointing teams. If you look at the advanced stats, neither of these teams are bad. There are holes. Clemson's O-line is an issue, it struggles to run the ball and Clemson's safeties can get picked on. Florida State, for its part, doesn't create much of a pass rush and can get picked apart through the air. But I'll take the home team. Clemson is slightly more talented, and they do have the bodies defensively to slow FSU's run game. … Clemson 24, Florida State 21.Crawford (Clemson -2): These two teams have fallen hard this season. It's hard to believe both preseason darlings in the ACC are unranked and fighting for bowl eligibility in November, but that's where we are in an unpredictable league with two coaches struggling to find wins. At some point, Clemson's six-game home losing streak to Power Four competition has to end. I'll go ahead and make the call that it happens on Saturday. ... Clemson 23, Florida State 20.LSU at No. 4 Alabama\nHummer (LSU +10.5): It's difficult to know how LSU is going to respond after Brian Kelly's firing and an offensive coordinator change. These two teams aren't far apart in terms of talent. But the Tigers have real concerns in the run game and stopping teams from attacking them in the middle of the field. But we've seen on more than one occasion teams respond well after an interim change. I think LSU is going to play hard. There's enough talent there for the Tigers to keep it close. … Alabama 34, LSU 24.\nCrawford (Alabama -10.5): Picking too many favorites this week it feels like, but Alabama should be up for this one against one of four SEC teams right now under interim leadership. The Tigers are unranked and outside of the playoff picture while the Crimson Tide are gunning for a top-4 seed and berth in Atlanta with a couple of more wins. Kalen DeBoer continues to stress the week-to-week mentality for his team and quarterback Ty Simpson could take a big step in the Heisman race with a multi-touchdown outing. Give me Alabama, big. ... Alabama 31, LSU 10.Navy at No. 10 Notre Dame\nHummer (Navy +24.5): Barring a shock, the Irish are going to win this game. They're more talented and have the run defense (12th nationally) to slow the nation's most efficient down-to-down rushing attack. The question becomes can Navy keep it close enough? The Midshipmen will control the clock. But I don't trust a defense that ranks 87th nationally in yards allowed per play to provide much resistance a week after it got blasted by North Texas. Still, 24.5 is a huge line. Navy puts together one or two long scoring drives and manages to cover. … Notre Dame 38, Navy 14.Crawford (Navy +24.5): The Midshipmen were my preseason pick to win the American and get to the playoff. That's not happening after the loss at North Texas knocked Navy from the ranks of the unbeaten, but I think this team will show some fight this weekend against the Fighting Irish. Now, if fumble issues show up again like they did in last season's matchup, this one's a rout in the other direction. If you're taking the Navy side here, you're hoping for fewer possessions and a couple clock-eating drives from the Midshipment to cover. ... Notre Dame 31, Navy 14.\nAuburn at No. 16 Vanderbilt\nHummer (Vanderbilt -7): Diego Pavia must be a little sad he didn't get to face Hugh Freeze one last time. As it is, I'll take Vanderbilt in this matchup. Auburn's defense is good. It's been good all year. But I just don't see Auburn as constructed, even after a quarterback change, managing to score enough points to beat Vanderbilt. … Vanderbilt 27, Auburn 18.Crawford (Vanderbilt -7): This one could get ugly when you consider the focus one team has on staying in the playoff race and the other on an interim coach following Hugh Freeze's firing. The Tigers have managed to keep every SEC game they've played within a possession or two this season, hence the line here. It doesn't matter who starts at quarterback for Auburn, though. Vanderbilt should dominate this one. ... Vanderbilt 24, Auburn 7.No. 1 Ohio State at Purdue\nHummer (Ohio State -28): We've seen some weird stuff happen when Ohio State travels to Purdue in the past. But the Boilermakers have shown some real cracks during their seven-game losing streak. The good offensive teams have scored on Purdue without much problem. The Boilermakers aren't really scoring lately, either, managing just 15 points on average over their last four games. Ohio State is by far the best team Purdue's seen this season. They get a win and a cover. … Ohio State 42, Purdue 13.\nCrawford (Ohio State -28): I'm not a fan of giving a home team four touchdowns, but the Buckeyes are really, really talented. You could make the argument in fact that Ohio State may have the five best players in college football this season at quarterback, linebacker, safety and two phenoms at wideout. It would not shock me here if the Boilermakers keep it close for a half and perhaps cover late, so I wouldn't go too heavy on this play. ... Ohio State 38, Purdue 7.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        By the time the NFL trade deadline passed Tuesday, Darren Mougey had done more to reshape the New York Jets' future than any GM in recent team history. Two cornerstone defenders were gone, a stack of first-round picks was added and still Mougey refused to label it a teardown.\"The goal is always to win,\" Mougey said. \"These coaches and players work too hard every day, all day, with the goal of winning on Sunday. That never changes.\"Few could blame onlookers for using the word anyway. The Jets, sitting at 1-7 and headed toward their 15th straight year without a playoff berth, traded cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys in two of the biggest deals of the day. The moves gave the franchise an abundance of draft capital -- and raised questions about the timeline for contention under Mougey and first-year coach Aaron Glenn.The Gardner trade was especially jarring. Just four months after signing a four-year, $120 million extension, the All-Pro corner was dealt to Indianapolis for two first-round picks (2026 and 2027) and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell. Mougey said the Colts' offer kept improving until it became impossible to refuse.\n\"Indianapolis kept getting richer and richer with their value, and eventually it was too good to pass up,\" Mougey said.Mougey added that Gardner's contract had been structured with flexibility in mind, allowing the team to act if a deal of this magnitude ever emerged.\"You never know how the future is going to unfold,\" he said. \"And we always wanted to be in a position to potentially trade these contracts.\"\nWilliams, the three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle, was sent to Dallas for a 2026 second-round pick, a 2027 first-rounder and defensive lineman Mazi Smith. Mougey declined to say whether he had requested a trade.\"I'm not here to talk about rumors and different things,\" Mougey said. \"I have a lot of discussions with GMs and players throughout the course of the year and I'll keep all those discussions private between myself and GMs and players out of respect for the other party.\" Mougey insists the Jets aren't waving the white flag, even if the roster tells a different story. The franchise that hasn't reached the postseason since 2010 now owns five first-round picks over the next two drafts -- a war chest designed to build something lasting rather than patch another short-term fix.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Some of the biggest stars in the 2025 recruiting class made their respective college debuts on the opening night of the 2025-26 college basketball season on Monday. While Kansas guard Darryn Peterson showed basketball fans a glimpse of why he could be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, Arizona forward Koa Peat stole the show and produced one of the most impressive performances by a first-year player in recent memory.Peat finished with 30 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and one block in Arizona's 93-87 upset win over reigning national champion Florida. He physically imposed his will against one of the most talented frontcourts in the nation and used his 6-foot-8, 235-pound frame to score at will.While Peat was lighting up the competition in Sin City, Peterson was making his debut in front of fans at Allen Fieldhouse. Peterson finished with 21 points, four rebounds and three assists in the 94-51 win over Green Bay. BYU forward AJ Dybantsa, the No. 2 overall player in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, also finished with 21 points in a win over Villanova.\n        \n            \n                Expert picks for Final Four: Who will win the 2026 NCAA Tournament and more bold predictions for this season\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDuke forward Cameron Boozer made his college debut on Tuesday against Texas. Boozer finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds in his team's 75-60 win over the Longhorns. The Blue Devils produced the national player of the year last season (Cooper Flagg), and Boozer is expected to also be in the mix for the most prestigious individual award in the sport.\nHere is how every five-star prospect from the 2025 recruiting class by 247Sports fared in their college debuts this week in order of their 247Sports ranking as a a recruit.\n    \n                                        \n    1. Darryn Peterson | G | KansasDebut stats: 21 points, four rebounds and three assistsPeterson started strong against Green Bay. He scored 18 points in the first half and connected on 6-of-10 attempts from the floor in the first 20 minutes of action. Peterson also showed off his playmaking (three assists) and played some solid on-ball defense. The real test for Peterson will come against better competition, but it's hard to not get excited about his long-term outlook. Again, it would be surprising to me if he wasn't considered the clear-cut No. 1 prospect within the next few weeks.\n\n    \n                                        \n    2. AJ Dybantsa | F | BYUDebut stats: 21 points, six rebounds and three assistsDybansta made his debut in Las Vegas against Villanova in the most highly anticipated debut in the history of BYU's basketball program. One of the top candidates to become the No. 1 overall pick this summer finished with 21 points, five rebounds and three assists. There has never been more hype around the BYU program than right now. If Dybansta plays to his potential, that hype will grow tenfold. Dybansta scored 12 of those 21 points in the second half during his team's 69-64 win.\n\n    \n                                        \n    3. Cameron Boozer | F | DukeDebut stats: 15 points, 13 rebounds and two assistsBoozer started slow on the offensive end of the floor against Texas. He missed his first seven shot attempts from the floor and scored zero points through the first 20 minutes of play. However, in the second half, Boozer showed flashes of why he's such a highly regarded prospect with his versatility and strength on both ends. Boozer scored all 15 of his points in the second half and finished with a double-double despite a slow start.\n\n    \n                                        \n    4. Nate Ament | F | TennesseeDebut stats: 18 points, nine rebounds and one assistAment, the highest-ranked recruit in Tennessee program history, started slow in the first half before coming on strong. Ament scored 12 of his team-high 18 points in the second half during the 76-61 win over Mercer. Ament is a skilled shotmaker who should thrive in a featured role for Rick Barnes' squad. Barnes has had plenty of hits in the transfer portal, but Ament is the most talented player he has had since arriving in Knoxville.\n\n    \n                                        \n    5. Darius Acuff Jr. | G | ArkansasDebut stats: 22 points, four assists and two reboundsArkansas coach John Calipari had plenty of success stories at Kentucky in developing point guards who are ready to play at the NBA level. Acuff looks like he's going to be next. Acuff finished with 22 points, four assists and two rebounds in 29 minutes during a 109-77 win over Southern. Acuff was good as advertised and he can be a real difference maker for Calipari this season.\n\n    \n                                        \n    6. Mikel Brown Jr. | G | LouisvilleDebut stats: 11 points, six assists and three reboundsBrown only logged 18 minutes amid a blowout win over South Carolina State. Brown finished with 11 points, six assists and three rebounds. Brown thrived this summer while playing in the FIBA U19 World Cup. He is a true floor general who can raise the floor and ceiling of this Louisville roster. In a non-blowout situation, he should get more opportunities to show that.\n    \n                                        \n    7. Chris Cenac Jr. | C | HoustonDebut stats: 12 points, 10 rebounds and one blockCenac was one of two freshmen in Houston's starting lineup on opening night against Lehigh. Cenac, a projected first-round pick in this summer's draft, showed off why he was one of the most coveted big men in the most recent recruiting cycle by posting a double-double: 12 points, 10 rebounds in a 75-57 win. The race for Big 12 Freshman of the Year should be an all-timer, and Cenac should be in the mix.\n\n    \n                                        \n    8. Caleb Wilson | F | North Carolina Debut stats: 22 points, four rebounds and three assistsSince 2013, North Carolina has produced just two lottery picks. Cameron Johnson (No. 11 overall) and Coby White (No. 7 overall) were both selected in the 2019 NBA Draft. The good news for North Carolina is that the drought could end this summer. Wilson logged just 25 minutes but finished with 22 points on 8-of-10 shooting. He also added four rebounds and three assists in the 94-54 win over Central Arkansas. He looks like the real deal.\n\n    \n                                        \n    9. Brayden Burries | G | ArizonaDebut stats: Three points and two assistsBurries was in the starting lineup against Florida and finished with three points and two assists in the upset win over the Gators. Burries was in foul trouble and picked up his fifth and final foul with less than four minutes remaining.\n    \n                                        \n    10. Alijah Arenas | G | USCHas yet to make debut due to injuryArenas suffered a torn meniscus earlier this summer and is expected to miss most -- if not all -- of the 2025-26 season. He is the son of the former NBA player Gilbert Arenas.\n    \n                                        \n    11. Koa Peat | F | ArizonaDebut stats: 30 points, seven rebounds and five assistsPeat had one of the best debuts by any player in the history of the sport. The 30 points Peat finished with mostly came at the rim. Peat was going up against a talented and experienced frontcourt and was the best player on the floor regardless of age or position. Peat has a chance to be a real player for Tommy Lloyd this season. This debut was just a glimpse of what he might be able to do. The last time Arizona went to the Final Four was 2001. If Peat plays like this the rest of the year, the Wildcats will be in the mix.\n\n    \n                                        \n    12. Braylon Mullins | G | UConnHas yet to make debut due to injuryMullins suffered an ankle injury in practice last month and is expected to be sidelined for most of the month of November. Mullins was named the preseason Big East Freshman of the Year by CBS Sports.\n    \n                                        \n    13. Meleek Thomas | G | ArkansasDebut stats: 21 points, six rebounds and seven assistsThomas was an instant spark off the bench for the Razorbacks. Thomas finished with 21 points, seven assists, six rebounds and three steals. Three different Arkansas players finished with at least 20 points, and two of them were first-year players. Calipari has developed plenty of one-and-done players during his coaching career. Thomas and Acuff are well on their way to becoming the next great one-and-done players to play for Coach Cal.\n    \n                                        \n    14. Tounde Yessoufou | F | BaylorDebut stats: 24 points, seven rebounds and one assistSince 2021, Baylor coach Scott Drew has produced six first-round picks -- including VJ Edgecombe, who became the highest-drafted player in program history this past summer. Yessoufou is going to be next. He finished with 24 points and seven rebounds in just 30 minutes of play. He was also efficient by connecting on 10 of 16 of his attempts from the floor. Yessoufou is already one of the most athletic players in the sport. \n\n    \n                                        \n    15. Nikolas Khamenia | F | DukeDebut stats: Four points, three rebounds and two assistsKhamenia came off the bench against Texas and logged 14 minutes. He only attempted two field goals -- both from the 3-point line -- and connected on one of them. He finished with four points, three rebounds and two assists in the win over the Longhorns.Other notable debuts\n    \n                                        \n    32. Kiyan Anthony | G | SyracuseDebut stats: 15 points, three rebounds and three assistsThe son of NBA legend Carmelo Anthony is already making his own mark at his father's alma mater. Anthony came off the bench during his team's 85-47 win over Binghamton and recorded 15 points, three rebounds and three assists. Despite coming off the bench, he logged a team-high 29 minutes.\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 21 Trey McKenney | G | MichiganDebut stats: 21 points, four assists and two reboundsMichigan's highest-ranked recruit had a very efficient debut off the bench. McKenney scored 21 points on 7-of-10 shooting and knocked down six 3-pointers in his team's 121-78 win over Oakland.\n\n    \n                                        \n    No. 22 Shon Abaev | F | CincinnatiDebut stats: 18 points, two rebounds and one assistThe No. 22 overall prospect in the 2025 recruiting cycle scored 18 points on 7 of 12 shooting in Cincinnati's 94-63 win over Western Carolina.

The defense is the strength of Northern Illinois, especially versus the air game. The Huskies rank 15th in the nation in both passing yards allowed per game and passing touchdowns given up. Additionally, Northern Illinois is a disciplined crew as they commit the 16th fewest penalties per game.Discipline happens to be something that Toledo is lacking as just seven teams in FBS commit more penalties per game. The Rockets also struggle where it matters the most, and that's in the redzone. Toledo ranks 117th (out of 136 FBS teams) in redzone scoring as the team registered just one touchdown over its 11 possessions in its defeat to Washington State. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Toledo can coverThe Rockets have dominated both the all-time and the recent series between these programs. Toledo owns a 35-17 record versus Northern Illinois, including three straight victories. Toledo has also been the far better team this season, especially on its home field.

To this point, they've delivered while providing some thrills in the process.The Canadiens are a fun team to watch, and not just because they have some of the most exciting young talent in the entire league. If Montreal is playing, you can almost guarantee that it's going to be a white-knuckle ride.In their first 13 games, the Canadiens have played 10 one-goal contests. Six of those have gone past regulation, and five of those have resulted in wins for Montreal. Olympic hopeful Cole Caufield has iced three games with overtime winners already.In their lone overtime loss, which came against the Flyers on Tuesday night, the Habs erased an early 3-0 deficit and even led entering the third period. This team is a roller coaster ride, but there have been far more ups than downs thus far.\nThe question is whether Montreal can sustain this type of performance for 82 games. After all, the game of hockey is too random for one-goal games to keep breaking one team's way over a large sample size.When you take a deeper look, this Montreal team doesn't have the underlying numbers of a true contender, but you cannot deny this team as some kind of intangible X-factor.

The man is incendiary, but I doubt his 31.0% shooting percentage holds up (sorry to disappoint).\n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            7-7-0\n                        \n                                27\n                            \n                                    Blackhawks\n                                \n                            One thing is clear when watching Blackhawks games: Frank Nazar has some juice. He leads the Blackhawks with 5.31 expected goals, and he seems to create a scoring chance every time the puck touches his stick in the offensive zone.\n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            5-5-3\n                        \n                                28\n                            \n                                    Sharks\n                                \n                            Back-to-back wins over the Devils and Avalanche were good!

Those two have typically been studs in that area, but that hasn't been the case to this point.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            5-6-3\n                        \n                                30\n                            \n                                    Predators\n                                \n                            Steven Stamkos had a nice game-tying goal on Tuesday, but outside of that, his start has been an unmitigated disaster. It's probably time for the Predators to start exploring their -- presumably limited -- options on the trade market.\n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            5-6-4\n                        \n                                31\n                            \n                                    Blues\n                                \n                            You wouldn't know it based on their record, but St. Louis is one of the best five-on-five teams in the NHL. The Blues are down here because goaltending has completely failed them. Jordan Binnington and Joel Hofer have combined to allow 14.1 goals above average.\n                        \n                            4\n                        \n                            4-7-2\n                        \n                                32\n                            \n                                    Flames\n                                \n                            The Flames picked up a win on Sunday, so that's cool.

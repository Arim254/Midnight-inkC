    "body": "\n        The Tennessee women's basketball team has dismissed senior guard Ruby Whitehorn, head coach Kim Caldwell announced on Sunday. The decision came a few days after Whitehorn was charged with simple possession of marijuana following a traffic stop in Knoxville.\"It is my responsibility to protect the high standards of this historic program,\" Caldwell said. \"In light of recent events, Ruby has been unable to reflect those standards, and I have made the difficult decision to dismiss her from our team. I love Ruby and will always be rooting for her, but my priority is to uphold the respected reputation of the Lady Vols.\"Whitehorn was arrested on Thursday around 4:30 a.m. as police confiscated 5.59 grams of marijuana, which is illegal in the state of Tennessee. This incident happened just hours after the Lady Vols took a 148-48 victory in an exhibition game against Columbus State. Whitehorn had one of the best performances for Tennessee with 18 points on 8 of 9 shooting along with 7 rebounds.This was her second arrest since August, when she was charged with aggravated burglary and domestic assault. She served a suspension from team activities after that one.\nWhitehorn joined the Lady Vols ahead of their 2024-25 campaign after spending her first two college basketball years with Clemson. She quickly earned a spot in the starting lineup and averaged 11.6 points and 4.0 rebounds per game. Whitehorn was expected to be one of the key returners for Tennessee this season and was recently named to the Ann Meyers Drysdale Shooting Guard of the Year Preseason Top 20 Watch List.Her absence takes away some important depth for the team, but Caldwell said this decision is what's best for the program in the long run.\"We have standards in this program and it's a sad situation. It's a difficult situation.\" the coach said. \"I feel bad for this current team that we have, and time will tell if it's the right choice for this team. But I have no doubt that it's the right choice for the team four or five years from now.\"\nOn Sunday after the news of her dismissal, Whitehorn shared a message on social media and said she was going to take time to work on her mental health.\"As most of you know, this has not been my best year,\" she said. \"I'm not usually one to open up about my personal life or challenges and that is part of the reason I am in this position today. For the past couple of months I have walked by fear and not faith. Fear of asking for help, for guidance, fear of failure.\"To my coaches & teammates, I appreciate the support on and off the court. I have failed to uphold the standards of the lady vol legacy and what it represents and for that I apologize. To the Lady Vol community and fans your support and encouragement will forever be appreciated.\"\nThe Lady Vols enter the season as the No. 8 team in the AP Top 25 poll. Their season opener will be on Tuesday night against No. 9 NC State in the Ro Greensboro Invitational. The game will tip off at 4 p.m. ET on ESPN2.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chargers held on for a 27-20 victory over the lowly Titans in Week 9, but the win came with a significant loss. Left tackle Joe Alt suffered what is believed to be a right high-ankle sprain, his second such injury this season. This time, it is feared the high-ankle sprain may require surgery, according to ESPN.Alt missed three games earlier this season after suffering the same injury in Week 4, though a longer absence could be in store this time with a Monday MRI set to reveal an official strategy moving forward.Alt's presence -- or lack thereof -- protecting quarterback  Justin Herbert's blindside has been absolutely crucial for the Chargers this season.Chargers in 2025Joe Alt on the fieldJoe Alt off the fieldExpected points added per play0.10-0.03Net yards per attempt7.86.0Pressure rate43.5%38.4%The Chargers are 5-1 when Alt plays and 1-2 when he does not. Los Angeles has operated like one of the NFL's top five offenses when Alt is on the field, only to degrade to playing about as well as the Panthers -- the No. 22 offense in EPA per play -- when he is sidelined.Alt is playing left tackle because Rashawn Slater tore his patellar tendon in the preseason, shortly after becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history.\nAustin Deculus, who previously started in Alt's place, suffered an ankle injury in Week 7 and was inactive this week despite not carrying an injury designation. Starting guard Mekhi Becton (hand) was also inactive, and right tackle Bobby Hart left with groin and ankle injuries.On Los Angeles' final offensive drive, the offensive line was, from left to right, Jamaree Salyer, Zion Johnson, Bradley Bozeman, Foster Sarell and Trey Pipkins. It was the first time this season Salyer played left tackle and Sarell's first start at right guard. Pipkins hadn't started since Week 6.Alt's absence could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Herbert has taken 28 sacks this season, third-most in the NFL, and he has been contacted 80 times, most in the NFL.\nSunday, against a struggling Titans defense, Herbert was contacted 10 times. With the running backs struggling, he was the team's leading rusher with 57 yards and a touchdown.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In Week 9, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 10 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Terrell Jennings, RB, PatriotsWith Rhamondre Stevenson sidelined, Jennings played a key role in the Patriots rushing attack. He led the team in rushing attempts with 11 -- a good sign on his own -- and he got the red zone opportunity -- an even better sign. Jennings scored a touchdown with 35 yards on 11 carries. He also added a reception for nine yards. If Stevenson's injury lingers, Jennings has some intrigue as a Flex play with a lead on the red zone role in a high-octane scoring offense facing an easy schedule rest of season.Parker Washington, WR, JaguarsWith Travis Hunter placed on injured reserve, some expected Brian Thomas Jr. season would finally be upon us. That expetation made some sense from a raw talent standpoint, but it ignored the lack of rapport Trevor Lawrence and Thomas have shown together all season. Thomas' best games a a rookie cam with Mac Jones. Washington took over as Lawrence's lead target in the Jaguars' passing attack coming out of the bye week in a new-look pass attack. Washington finished with a team-high 77 yards receiving on eight targets (and seven catches). Thomas also left Week 9 with an ankle injury and after that the Jaguars leaned even more heavily on Washiongton. Washington will be mainstay in PPR leagues and could push into the WR2/3 discussion if he continues to get targeted at this rate. Demario Douglas, WR, PatriotsIt's never easy to figure out where the targets and production are going but we know for certain that production will be coming in this Patriots pass attack. Drake Maye is the truth and Josh McDaniels has maximized his skill set as a drive thrower with elite touch on the vertical plane. Douglas has the speed to win over the top in addition to creating underneath -- he just needed a quarterback like Maye to bring out this area of his game. Douglas is worth stashing in deeper leagues but will struggle to find consistency in a crowded pass game.\nAndrei Iosivas, WR, BengalsIosivas racked up five receptions for 66 yards and a touchdown in Week 9. He will benefit from game script and Joe Flacco as his quarterback. Flacco threw for 450+ in Week 9 as the Bengals defense continued to allow score after score. This led to a late-game scoring opportunity for Andrei who cashed in. He's an interesting stash. He won't find consistent Fantasy value unless Tee Higgins or Ja'Marr Chase get hurt -- but if they do he will be an every-week starter.RJ Harvey, RB, BroncosIt has been a disappointing rookie season for Harvey after coming in with major expectations in the Fantasy Football community, but he is starting to find his niche now. The Broncos are using him as an extension of their run game when their run game struggles to create early. This has been the case early and often for Denver, so they turn to Harvey. In this game, Harvey racked up another five receptions for 51 receiving yards and a score. Harvey has worked his way into the FLEX conversation in PPR leagues.\nBrian Robinson, RB, 49ersRobinson reminded us in Week 9 of what he's capable of when given opportunities. He finished with 53 yards rushing and a touchdown on just five carries. This is a reminder to all Fantasy Football managers that Robinson is the best handcuff stash in the game. If he's unrostered in your league, there's no higher-upside bench stash available. Sign him for your stretch run.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the Week 9 edition of \"Monday Night Football,\" the Dallas Cowboys play host to the Arizona Cardinals.The Cowboys are coming off a disastrous loss against the Denver Broncos last week, which dropped them to 3-4-1 on the season. Dallas has yet to creep above .500 this year, but it has also not dropped two in a row at any point in 2025.Arizona has now lost five in a row since starting 2-0, dropping perhaps too far back in the race for the NFC West and the wild card spot. The Cardinals are coming off a much-needed bye in Week 8, but they're still not fully healthy as Kyler Murray is not yet ready to return from the injury that kept him out of the team's previous two games.Will the Cowboys get back on track, or will the Cardinals finally get back in the win column? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Cardinals liveDate: Monday, Nov. 3 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Cowboys -3; O/U 53.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)When the Cardinals have the ballJacoby Brissett will make a third consecutive start in place of Kyler Murray. The Cardinals' offense has been both more efficient and more explosive with Brissett under center, as they have leaned into passing the ball more often and he has found a connection with star tight end Trey McBride that Murray often failed to establish. Brissett is 52 of 80 for 599 yards, four touchdowns and an interception in his pair of starts, connecting with McBride on 18 of 24 attempts for 146 yards and three scores.The Dallas pass defense has been arguably the friendliest in the entire league, surrendering the second-most passing yards per game in the NFL while allowing opponents to complete an incredible 68.5% of their passes at an otherworldly average of 8.2 yards per attempt. Dallas has actually surprisingly gotten pressure at a slightly above-average rate, but has proven utterly incapable of converting that pressure into sacks, registering a minuscule 5.3% sack rate, according to Tru Media.The Cowboys have also just consistently sprung leaks in their coverage, leaving pass-catchers of all stripes open all over the field as they have already yielded an incredible 15 touchdown catches to wide receivers, per Pro-Football-Reference, the most in the league. They've given up 41 total receptions to running backs, which ranks seventh-worst in the NFL. They've been better against tight ends of late, but part of that is because they've recently faced an unimposing tight end slate. Against McBride, their linebackers and safeties are likely to be at a significant disadvantage. \nThe Arizona run game has been almost entirely shut down in the absence of James Conner and Trey Benson, with the duo of Michael Carter and Bam Knight combining to average a mere 3.1 yards per carry. The Cowboys, though, have gotten clocked on the ground to the tune of 4.9 yards per carry, and they've given up at least 136 yards on the ground in each of their last five games. Their leaky run defense should allow the Cards at least a chance to get going on the ground, although the poor quality of the offensive line and actual talent at running back could still hold them back.When the Cowboys have the ballUp until last week against the Broncos, the Cowboys' offense had looked nearly unstoppable. Dak Prescott was playing at the highest level of his career -- including the year where he finished second in MVP voting -- and with CeeDee Lamb returning to the lineup to flank George Pickens and Jake Ferguson, Dallas was racking up yards and denting scoreboards left and right. And then the Broncos just totally dominated the game up front, held Javonte Williams almost entirely in check, and forced Prescott into mistakes for seemingly the first time this year. The Cardinals' defense, though, is not the Broncos' defense. Arizona checks in at 21st in EPA per play allowed, via Tru Media, ranking fifth against the run but 22nd against the pass. \nThe Cowboys' Williams-led run game has been efficient for most of the season thanks to both the play-calling of Brian Schottenheimer and the run game design of former Cardinals offensive line coach Klayton Adams, whom the Cowboys hired as their offensive coordinator. Williams doesn't have many explosive runs (just 6.5% of his carries have gained 12 or more yards, per Tru Media), but he's clipped off five-plus-yard runs at an extremely high rate and rarely lost yards on his carries. If he can keep the Cowboys on schedule when given the ball, it should give the Dallas passing game ample opportunity to tear up Arizona's secondary.Lamb has receiving lines of 7-110-0, 9-112-0, 5-110-1 and 7-74-0 in his four full games this season, and frankly the Cardinals do not have anybody who can cover him -- especially with slot corner Garrett Williams still on injured reserve. Lamb plays a ton in the slot, and he has an advantage over just about everybody when he lines up inside. Pickens should also have a size and strength advantage against Arizona's perimeter corners, though Will Johnson should have a better chance against him than the smaller Max Melton. The Cards have hemorrhaged catches to tight ends so far this season, which should give Ferguson a chance to get untracked as well. \nSo long as the Cowboys can keep Prescott well protected -- and Arizona is only 25th in pressure rate, per Tru Media -- then Prescott should have plenty of time to pick apart the Cardinals on the back end. Dallas struggled in the protection game last week but should have its full offensive line back for this one and, again, is going up against a significantly weaker pass rush than the one it squared off with last week. Cowboys vs. Cardinals prediction, pick\nAs is usually the case with their games, the Cowboys have some significant matchup advantages on offense and some significant disadvantages on defense. When that's the case, we tend to put our trust in whichever quarterback is the better bet to drive offensive efficiency. Here, that's Prescott, rather than Brissett. Pick: Cowboys 30, Cardinals 23\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There were two teams who have been fixtures in NFL Draft order posts on a bye this week: the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets. Ironically, those two teams not only return to action in Week 10, but they'll face one another. When the regular season is over and fans reflect upon the season, that game could be the difference in one of those clubs being in position to draft a quarterback in April. A Sunday afternoon game was particularly brutal for Browns fans, as the Jacksonville Jaguars escaped Las Vegas with an overtime victory against the Raiders. Cleveland holds Jacksonville's first-round pick and has the same number of wins as the Raiders. As a reminder, there are three teams without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons deal: Atlanta, Green Bay and Jacksonville. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order, per Tankathon, as well as potential team needs:\n1. New Orleans Saints (1-8)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRThe Saints lost their first four games before securing their first win. They're currently on a four-game losing streak. Will they snap it again next week against the Panthers? 2. Tennessee Titans (1-8)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGETennessee put up a fight but ultimately fell short vs. the Chargers. The Titans may have gotten a spark after the Brian Callahan firing, but will that persist?3. New York Jets (1-7)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEThe Jets were on a bye this weekend, but return next week against the Browns, who were also on a bye.\n4. Miami Dolphins (2-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami made the decision to dismiss general manager Chris Grier. For the time being, head coach Mike McDaniel appears to be safe despite the most recent loss to Baltimore.  5. New York Giants (2-7)Projected needs: IOL, OT, DL, CB, LBRookie quarterback Jaxson Dart put forth another strong effort against San Francisco, but it was not enough. New York has one of the toughest second-half schedules. 6. Cleveland Browns (2-6)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLThe Browns were on a bye this weekend, but return next week against the Jets, who are also on a bye.  \n7. Las Vegas Raiders (2-6)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas squandered a late lead to Jacksonville in regulation, then failed to convert a two-point conversion in overtime. 8. Arizona Cardinals (2-5)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBArizona travels to Arlington, Texas, on Monday night for a prime-time showdown with the Cowboys.9. Cincinnati Bengals (3-6)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Flacco continues to tap into the \"Fountain of Youth,\" but the clock may soon strike midnight for this Cinderella.\n10. Baltimore Ravens (3-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBLamar Jackson made his return to the football field in glorious fashion as the Ravens look to surge up the AFC North standings. Baltimore found itself in an unusual position among the top-10 overall, but may soon put that outlook in its rearview mirror.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 9 winners and losers: Bengals fold to ruin wild comeback; Vikings back in business with J.J.

Stroud exited Sunday's game against Denver early with a concussion as the Texans slipped further down the AFC South standings. \n14. Dallas Cowboys (3-4-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas hosts the Cardinals on \"Monday Night Football\" this week. 15. Minnesota Vikings (4-4)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBJ.J. McCarthy's return to the field proved fruitful for Justin Jefferson, who scored his second touchdown of the season in a divisional game against Detroit. 16. Carolina Panthers (5-4)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina's three-game win streak ended last week against Buffalo, but it began a new streak Sunday with a win over the Packers. 17. Kansas City Chiefs (5-4)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEKansas City had won five of its past six games. Momentum had been building within that organization. Buffalo used a late turnover to stall the Chiefs' momentum in the final minutes before batting down Patrick Mahomes' final attempt as time expired.\n18. Chicago Bears (5-3)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTChicago and Cincinnati went back and forth Sunday. Only five possessions between the two teams did not end up in either a field goal attempt or touchdown in the Bears' 47-42 win. 19. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (5-3)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLThe Jaguars needed a pass deflection on a two-point attempt in overtime to sneak away with a victory against the Raiders on Sunday. It was a double whammy for Cleveland, which not only has Jacksonville's pick, but also the same number of wins as Las Vegas.\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL mock draft: Steelers brace for post-Rodgers era; Cowboys chase more firepower for Dak Prescott\n                \n                    Cooper Petagna                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n20. Pittsburgh Steelers (5-3)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLPittsburgh was on the celebratory end of a critical contest with the Colts on Sunday. Jonathan Taylor was held to his lowest rushing total of the season (45).\n21. Detroit Lions (5-3)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTAn efficient Lions offense was not enough to overcome Minnesota on Sunday. 22. San Francisco 49ers (6-3)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TEMac Jones has started all but two games for the 49ers this season. Edge rusher Mykel Williams is expected to miss time with an injury sustained Sunday after Nick Bosa had already been lost for the season. 23. Los Angeles Chargers (6-3)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLTennessee kept pace with Justin Herbert and the Chargers for most of Sunday's affair, but ultimately Los Angeles put it away. Offensive tackle Joe Alt may miss some time with an ankle injury.24. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (5-2-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBA loss cannot hurt Dallas' pick from Green Bay, but the reality is that the Packers almost certainly will advance to the postseason. How far they go will determine where the Cowboys' pick lands.\n25. Seattle Seahawks (5-2)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRThe Seahawks travel to face the Commanders on \"Sunday Night Football.\"26. Buffalo Bills (6-2)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRKansas City and Buffalo delivered another classic as the Bills outlasted its counterpart Sunday afternoon. 27. Los Angeles Rams (6-2)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLLos Angeles has won three straight after decisively beating New Orleans on Sunday. 28. Denver Broncos (7-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTDenver is one of three teams in the NFL with seven wins. It has won six straight games after dropping two of three to open the year. \n29. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-2)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe Buccaneers utilized a much needed bye week to get healthier. Tampa Bay plays the Patriots next week. 30. New England Patriots (7-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEAtlanta scored 10 points in the fourth quarter to push the Patriots to the brink, but Drake Maye emerged victorious in a battle of 2024 first-round quarterbacks.31. Philadelphia Eagles (6-2)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia had a bye this week before returning to the public eye in prime time each of the next two weeks. 32. Indianapolis Colts (7-2)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLIndianapolis is undefeated at home this season, but is now .500 on the road. The Colts had six turnovers, including three interceptions.   The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        A few weeks after Auburn athletics director John Cohen compared Hugh Freeze's job to an unreliable car that he wasn't sure would start, the inevitable happened -- the Tigers fired Freeze. Ironically, Freeze's Auburn tenure actually ended as a slow-moving accident. Punt after punt after punt defined the Tigers' 10-3 home loss to Kentucky, the first time in 28 years the Tigers allowed 10 or fewer points and lost a game. The defeat dropped Freeze to 15-19 overall on The Plains. He ended his tenure 1-11 against ranked teams despite a top-13 roster in the sport, per the 247Sports Team Talent Composite. Unlike big-name coaches James Franklin and Brian Kelly who were fired earlier in the 2025 coaching carousel, there was no real argument to be made in favor of keeping Freeze. His reputation as an offensive wiz is in the tank; the Tigers rank No. 118 in yards per play despite a talented offensive line, elite wide receivers and a hand-picked transfer portal QB, Jackson Arnold, who had a seven-figure price tag (Freeze seemed to always pick the wrong portal QB, ignoring Cam Ward when he entered the transfer portal from Washington State). Auburn's coaching search promises to be a blockbuster with a heavy-handed booster class that loves to meddle. The Tigers need to nail the hire in an SEC that's getting more competitive by the week, it seems. \nAs for Freeze?The 56-year-old is a controversial college football figure whose long track record of success feels more distant with each blunder he makes (coaches across the country still cannot figure out why Freeze refused to reevaluate a collaborative play-calling approach). Be skeptical there's much of a market for Freeze as a head coach moving forward -- and it's also unclear if Freeze will want to coach again any time soon. Freeze was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February and is currently undergoing treatment. Doctors caught it early and he opted against immediate surgery to have the mass removed. That's because the cancer was deemed low aggressive, per Freeze. He said back in the summer he planned to reevaluate his health in January. \nThere was likely going to be industry speculation this season Freeze might step down from Auburn because of his health. So, it's reasonable to think Freeze may take some time off and focus on his recovery. He certainly doesn't mind having the time to play golf. As for a potential future in coaching, maybe Freeze could emerge as a candidate at a Group of Five program. He found outsized success in past stints at Arkansas State and Liberty. But checking with industry sources, it's hard to see Freeze making an immediate return as a Power Four head coach. He won't have the cachet of Franklin or a Kelly, and his baggage is immense. If Freeze desired it, he could likely grab a play-caller job somewhere or stash himself away on a staff as an analyst. \nFreeze benefits from the flexibility of an around $15 million buyout without a 'duty to mitigate' clause, which compels those like Franklin to find work right away to offset their buyout. It seems unlikely Freeze wants to fade away forever into the background -- he only took a year-long sabbatical after his Ole Miss tenure ended in a blaze of destruction -- but his chance at reaching the peaks of his Ole Miss tenure are shot. People tend to notice when a luxury car won't start. \n    \n                                        \n    The Auburn Tigers are searching for their next head football coach following the dismissal of Hugh Freeze.

    "description": "\n        The Bengals defense may have officially hit rock bottom amid a potentially lost season, falling to 3-6 after Sunday's 47-42 loss to the Bears",
    "body": "\n        The Bengals defense may have officially hit rock bottom amid a potentially lost season, falling to 3-6 after Sunday's 47-42 loss to the Bears. Cincinnati became the first team in at least the last 45 years to take a lead in regulation after trailing by 14-plus points in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter -- and still lose! And they lost in spectacular fashion, surrendering a 58-yard game-winning touchdown from Caleb Williams to rookie Colston Loveland in the final seconds.\nThe lowlights didn't stop there. Cincinnati allowed 576 total yards, the most by any team in a game this season, and became just the 10th team in NFL history to give up 275-plus passing yards and 275-plus rushing yards in a single contest. Worse, they did it against an inconsistent Bears offense that got big games from Kyle Monangai, Brittain Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus.It was a nightmare of epic proportions in a string of nightmares. The Bengals also lost 39-38 and blew a 15-point fourth-quarter lead against the then-winless Jets a week ago, just days after their owner publicly ridiculed his quarterback for not being able to complete a pass.\nThe list of historic lows is downright embarrassing:They are the first team in 59 years to lose consecutive games while scoring 38 or more points. The last to do it was the 1966 New York Giants -- back when the NFL had only 15 teams and had yet to crown its first Super Bowl champion.They have allowed 500 total yards in two straight games and three times this season. The rest of the league has done it a combined two times.They are allowing 33.3 points per game this season, the most by any team since those same 1966 Giants.They have allowed at least 27 points and 350 or more total yards in eight straight games, the longest such streak within a single season in NFL history.That is a convincing case for one of the worst defenses the league has ever seen. And the dumpster fire didn't start this year. Last season, they lost games while scoring 33, 34, 38, 38 and 38 points, finishing with the highest points per game in losses in NFL history (27.8).These new lows are still stunning, even though we've seen this record on loop. Cincinnati has lost four games in the last two seasons while scoring 38 or more points, matching the total of the rest of the league combined in that span. No other team has done it more than twice over a two-season stretch in NFL history.Why is this happening?As stunning as it is, maybe it shouldn't be that surprising. The Bengals' already terrible defense was essentially gutted in the offseason. They fired Lou Anarumo, one of the most respected defensive minds in the league. They had contract disputes with their two most important defensive investments -- Trey Hendrickson and Shemar Stewart -- and lost other key defenders, including Sam Hubbard (retirement) and Germaine Pratt (release). They are also strapped for cash, with nearly half of their cap space tied up in contracts for Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\nLet go of Lou AnarumoLou Anarumo was clearly the fall guy for Cincinnati's defensive downturn in recent seasons, even though the issue largely lies with personnel, among other factors. \"The Mad Scientist,\" as he's known, was not the problem. He has done just fine with an underwhelming Colts defense for a team off to a 7-2 start. New Bengals defensive coordinator Al Golden could be the next fall guy, which would be pretty unfair.Pissed off important investmentsIt is hard to expect much more from Golden when you consider all the talent the Bengals have either lost or pissed off in recent months. Hendrickson and Stewart both held out in training camp. Bengals owner Mike Brown even said, \"We're not paying someone to sit in jail,\" referring to Stewart and the team's reluctance to offer him a fully guaranteed rookie deal.The Bengals also saw Hubbard -- their starting edge rusher opposite Trey Hendrickson -- retire. They released Pratt, one of the team's leading tacklers. Anarumo's chess piece, slot corner Mike Hilton, followed him to Indianapolis. More recently, linebacker Logan Wilson requested a trade.\nUnable to draft and developThe fault lies with the front office. This is a team that can't draft and develop on defense, and now it can't spend on that side of the ball.They are having these results despite using their first two picks on defensive players in three of the last four drafts:2022: S Dax Hill and CB Cam Taylor-Britt2023: EDGE Myles Murphy and CB DJ Turner2025: EDGE Shemar Stewart and Demetrius Knight Jr.They haven't drafted a stud on defense in a long time despite plenty of swings. They drafted 59 defensive players between 2011 and 2024, and none of them made a Pro Bowl for Cincinnati. It is the longest active drought in the NFL without drafting a defensive player who went on to make a Pro Bowl for the team. The Bengals' last such picks were Geno Atkins and Carlos Dunlap in 2010.\nThey have consistently whiffed on draft picks on this side of the ball, especially in the first round. Their last two picks are complete busts to this point. Murphy, their first-round pick in 2023, has 4.5 sacks in 39 career games. His pressure rate has never eclipsed 10% in three seasons, which is already well below league average.Cincinnati drafted Stewart in the first round this year because he was an NFL Scouting Combine freak who drew comparisons to Myles Garrett -- despite totaling 4.5 sacks in 37 college games. The transition has been rough, as predicted. He had only five pressures in his first four career games entering Week 9, one of the worst rates in the league. It might be too soon to judge him, because he was always going to be a bit of a project.No money to spend So what happens when you can't draft and develop on defense and you can't spend there either? You have one of the worst defenses of all time.\nBurrow, Chase and Higgins are the highest-paid offensive trio in the NFL right now, making a combined $124 million in average annual salary. Overall, the Bengals have the most cap space tied up in their offense ($158 million), and they sit near the bottom in defensive spending ($82 million).Obviously, they needed to pay Burrow and Chase -- they are generational talents. Higgins is a bona fide star, but was paying another offensive player worth the issues it created on defense (and the offensive line)?What is the solution?What's the solution? Blow up the front office. I wouldn't fire Zac Taylor, who is an offensive-minded head coach and has a strong history with Joe Burrow. They could fire defensive coordinator Al Golden, and I expect that could be the next move, but he would just be another scapegoat like Anarumo.\nAll signs point to the front office. And that is where it gets complicated. Bengals owner Mike Brown is also the de facto general manager, similar to Jerry Jones with the Cowboys — meaning he is not going anywhere. Several family members also occupy front-office positions. Most personnel decisions go through director of player personnel Duke Tobin, who is essentially the general manager without the title. He has been in that role since 2002. Cincinnati entered 2025 with the smallest scouting department in the NFL.It all adds up to a frustrating situation for Bengals fans that is resulting in a wasted season with the generational combination of Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase. Front-office change is desperately needed, but I don't have faith that's going to happen because it's a family business. They should clean house and find scouts who can actually build a defense with draft capital.The most likely scenario is an unsuccessful fix at defensive coordinator, beefing up the league's smallest scouting department over time and trading Hendrickson at the deadline. That's a bleak outlook -- and about as disheartening as the last two weeks have been for Bengals fans.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If you simply pay attention to the standings, you may whistle past the NFC North and think that it's status quo. After all, the teams are in the same position coming out of Week 9 as they were coming into it, but don't be deceived. The division has been turned on its head thanks to the events of Sunday, and we're in for a wildly intriguing second half. Why, you ask? Well, the Minnesota Vikings are now firmly in the mix. The club went into Ford Field and took down the Detroit Lions, 27-24. On top of simply notching a divisional win, the key development in this game and what makes the victory hold bigger ramifications for the second half was the return of J.J. McCarthy. Coming into the game, I was skeptical about what McCarthy would look like. Before going down with a high ankle sprain in Week 2, the 2024 first-round pick looked like a quarterback who had little experience on his résumé. Outside of a fourth-quarter comeback against Chicago in Week 1, the offense was choppy with McCarthy under center in the early goings. In Week 9, however, the unit flowed much more effectively, and McCarthy looked comfortable at the helm. His stat line wasn't eye-popping as he completed 14 of his 25 passes for 143 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. He also rushed for 12 yards and a touchdown, while being sacked five times (nine total quarterback hits). And that's sort of what makes Minnesota's potential so fascinating. \nThey simply need average quarterback play to be competitive, and McCarthy can provide that. Over the last two weeks, Minnesota was falling flat, in part, because Carson Wentz was hobbled. As he played through injury, Wentz had more interceptions (3) than touchdowns (1), and averaged a 65.9 passer rating, so it should come as little surprise that they dropped both of those contests post-bye. With a healthy McCarthy reinstalled, the offensive ceiling has risen, which creates a path for Minnesota in the NFC North race. Despite sitting in last place at 4-4, the Vikings are just a game and a half back of the Green Bay Packers for first place, with both matchups still on deck. Currently, Minnesota owns the best in-division record at 2-0. More specifically, those division wins both came on the road (at Chicago in Week 1 and at Detroit in Week 9), so three of their four remaining games against NFC North opponents will take place at U.S. Bank Stadium. Moreover, Minnesota possesses the easiest remaining strength of schedule in the NFC North. \nAlready, we've seen that McCarthy can take down the Bears and Lions in their own building. While the jury is still out on whether or not they can also hang with Green Bay, the Packers have shown us that they are susceptible after losing to the Carolina Panthers at home on Sunday. They also may be going the rest of the season without star tight end Tucker Kraft, who was carted off with a knee injury. This is a long way of saying that Minnesota has a far better chance of catapulting to an NFC North crown than its current +1400 odds at FanDuel Sportsbook suggest.Game balls\nWeek 9 stats: 23 of 26 passing, 273 yards passing, 1 TD; 6 carries, 19 yards rushing, 2 TDsAllen flexed his MVP muscles in a 28-21 win over Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Not only was he efficient throwing the football, but he continues to be a mismatch in the red zone as a rusher. Allen now has surpassed Cam Newton for the most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (including playoffs) in NFL history. \nWeek 9 stats: 28 carries, 106 yards rushing, 1 TD; 5 catches, 67 yards receiving, 1 TDAnother week, another dual-threat outburst from McCaffrey. He continues to be the engine that makes the Niners run, leading the team both in rushing as well as receiving during the 34-24 win over the Giants. No matter who is under center and what other weapons are around him, McCaffrey routinely produces at an elite level. He now leads the NFL in yards from scrimmage and just enjoyed his 16th career game with a rushing and receiving touchdown, passing Marshall Faulk for the most in NFL history. Maybe the craziest aspect of McCaffrey's afternoon, however, was his receiving touchdown. Someone may want to inform the Giants to cover No. 23. \nWeek 9 stats: 9 catches, 118 yards receiving, 3 TDsThe Falcons were on the losing end, but it wasn't because of London. The Falcons wide receiver turned in a monster performance that didn't just include three receiving touchdowns, but the scores were tallied by way of circus catches. London one-handed his third touchdown while also toe-tapping his feet. This was the first three-touchdown reception day for the Falcons since Cordarrelle Patterson in 2021.  \nWeek 9 stats: 26 carries, 176 yards; 3 catches, 22 yards receivingWith D'Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson both sidelined, Monangai took on the major workload in the Bears backfield. The 2025 seventh-round pick took that opportunity and ran with it (literally). The Rutgers product recorded the second-most rushing yards in a game by a rookie in team history. Monangai was also the first Bear with 100-plus first-half rushing yards in his first career start since Matt Forte in 2008. \nWeek 9 stats: 25 carries, 130 yards rushing, 2 TDs; 2 catches, 11 yardsDowdle took back his starting role within the Panthers offense as Chuba Hubbard (five carries) worked as the backup. With the lion's share of touches, Dowdle resumed his explosive run with Carolina and was a key factor in the team's upset win over the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. This was Dowdle's first career game with two rushing touchdowns. The veteran back did have a mental error where he got flagged for excessive celebrations, which led to a missed PAT, but it did not ultimately come back to bite him. \nWeek 9 stats: 12 catches, 127 yards receiving, 3 TDsWelcome back, Brock Bowers! The star tight end had missed the last three games due to a knee injury and looked like his old self in Week 9. While it came in a losing effort, Bowers was a monster as Las Vegas forced overtime and nearly pulled off the upset over the Jaguars. He became the first player in Raiders history with 12 catches, 125 yards and three receiving touchdowns in a single game. \nWeek 9 stats: 6 catches, 118 yards receiving, 2 TDsLoveland enjoyed his best day as a pro in Week 9, and the rookie first-rounder scored the game-winning touchdown after ripping off a 58-yard catch and run to the end zone. \nNotable Week 9 gaffesBengals defense collapses ... AGAIN!Trailing 41-27 with less than three minutes to play in the fourth quarter, the Cincinnati offense miraculously clawed back and found itself with a 42-41 lead with less than a minute to play in regulation. Despite all that momentum, the defense once again proved to be its Achilles' heel. With 25 seconds left on the clock, Caleb Williams connected with Colston Loveland for a 58-yard touchdown to snatch the victory out of the Bengals hands. \nCincinnati has now allowed 300 points this season, which is the most through nine games in franchise history. They are also the first team in NFL history to allow at least 27 points and 350 total yards in eight-straight games within a single season. No matter how well Flacco has been able to stabilize the offense, the defense is what will keep the Bengals ceiling low. \nZac Taylor's challenge results in a Bears touchdownIt may seem like we're piling on with the Bengals, but it wasn't pretty in Week 9. While the defense was being gashed, their coach didn't do them any favors either. With under five minutes to play in the fourth quarter, Taylor challenged a 16-yard gain by DJ Moore. He was initially ruled down at the 1-yard line, but Taylor challenged, thinking he fumbled into the back of the end zone, which would've resulted in a touchback. Instead, the replay showed that not only did Moore not fumble, but he actually scored on the play, so it was reversed for a touchdown.\nTwo fourth-quarter miscues help Falcons fall to PatsAtlanta momentarily had New England on the ropes. Michael Penix Jr. led a 12-play, 85-yard touchdown drive, finding Drake London for a score on fourth-and-goal with just under five minutes left to play in regulation. That cut the Patriots lead to 24-23 with the PAT upcoming. Instead of knotting the game, however, Falcons placekicker Parker Romo -- who was with the Patriots this summer -- missed the extra point. \nWhile that miss kept the Patriots with a slim lead, the Falcons defense forced a three-and-out, giving the offense the ball back with 3:30 left to play. On that drive, Michael Penix Jr. seemed to be surprised by a second-and-10 snap, the Patriots immediately had pressure in his face, and he threw the ball to the turf. Penix appeared to think that New England had committed a penalty and threw the ball to the turf within the tackle box on a perceived dead play. However, there was no penalty on the Patriots, and Penix was then flagged for intentional grounding. That set up and third-and-20 situation from their own 42-yard line and an eventual punt. \nTwo-minute drillHere are some of my quick-hitting takeaways/notes from Week 9:The Green Bay Packers may have been caught looking ahead to the Philadelphia Eagles showdown next week, and the Carolina Panthers made them pay. That's now three games this season where the Packers have played down to their competition and have failed to win because of it.Matthew Stafford's four-touchdown day should only have his MVP drum beat louder. I believe Rashid Shaheed has played his last game for the New Orleans Saints. After catching five passes for 68 yards on Sunday, his trade stock should only grow leading up to the Nov. 4 deadline. Drake Maye now has recorded eight-straight games with at least 200 yards passing and a 100 passer rating (tied for the second-longest streak in a season in NFL history). The Broncos continue to have a knack for the comeback and have now won six straight to move to 7-2. They are tied for the most game-winning drives (four) in the NFL this season. Your antenna should be raised slightly after seeing Daniel Jones record five turnovers on Sunday.Can't underscore how important a win it was for Pittsburgh, especially with the Ravens winning with Lamar Jackson back. Keeps them with a little breathing room. Jacksonville may be 5-3 and in the playoff mix, but they are not a true threat in the AFC. Kansas City is now in third place in the AFC West, looking up to both the Broncos (7-2) and Chargers (6-3). Josh Allen is now 5-5 against Patrick Mahomes in their careers (including playoffs). While no other QB has more than three wins against Mahomes, Allen's 0-4 playoff record against his main rival remains the key sticking point in this head-to-head even after this latest victory. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL was destined for some wackiness, particularly after favorites dominated over the last few weeks. Well, that wackiness reared its head in Week 9 with some surprising results that will have ramifications that'll stretch throughout the second half of the year. First off, we head to Lambeau Field, where the Green Bay Packers were on the losing end of another shocking upset in 2025. This time, it was the Carolina Panthers who rolled into town and pulled off the 16-13 win after Ryan Fitzgerald drilled a game-winning 49-yard field goal as time expired. Elsewhere, the Colts laid an egg on the road to the Steelers, with Daniel Jones accounting for five turnovers on the afternoon, and the J.J. McCarthy-led Vikings stormed into Ford Field to beat the Detroit Lions. Like I said, wackiness!But what are mere one-off instances, and what are signs of more significant developments? Below, we'll decipher which overreactions from Week 9 are just that and which are reality. Daniel Jones has turned into a pumpkinOverreaction or reality: Overreaction\nThe Indianapolis Colts entered Week 9 as the AFC's No. 1 seed and the NFL's most explosive offense. Daniel Jones looked reborn, playing like one of the league's most efficient quarterbacks. And then it all came crashing down in Pittsburgh.\nThe Colts quarterback accounted for five turnovers (three interceptions and two fumbles lost) as Indy fell to the Steelers in a 27-20 defeat that wasn't nearly as close as the final score suggests. Coming into Sunday, Jones had just three turnovers for the entire year, so the floor fell completely out from under him. Is this Jones reverting to his New York Giants form? Are the Colts suddenly staring down a second-half collapse? Not yet. This felt more like a long-overdue letdown, and while the turnovers were jarring, the concern shouldn't reach panic territory -- unless it happens again next week in Berlin against the Falcons. If Jones looks rattled overseas, then it's time to start sounding alarms.The Bengals have the worst defense in the NFLOverreaction or reality: RealityWoof. It didn't matter that Joe Flacco rose Cincinnati from the dead and led the offense to a 42-point day; the defense refuses to let the Bengals succeed in 2025. For a minute, it looked like the Bengals were going to pull off a remarkable comeback after they recovered an onside kick, and Flacco immediately led a go-ahead touchdown drive to give Cincy the 42-41 lead with just under a minute left in regulation. Despite all that momentum flowing their way, the Bengals defense let Chicago travel 72 yards down the field and score the game-winning touchdown on a 58-yard catch-and-run by Colston Loveland.\nThis is by far the worst defense in football, and the unit has been nullifying prolific days offensively for the last few years. This season, the Bengals have allowed 300 points, which is the most through nine games in franchise history. They are also the first team in NFL history to allow at least 27 or more points and 350 total yards in eight straight games within a season. After another upset loss, the Packers aren't a serious contenderOverreaction or reality: Overreaction\n The Green Bay Packers were on the losing end of yet another surprising upset. Back in Week 3, they fell on the road to the Cleveland Browns and then tied the Dallas Cowboys the following week. Now, they are losing to the Carolina Panthers at Lambeau Field? Given those questionable outings, it's fair to wonder if their ceiling truly includes hoisting a Lombardi Trophy in 2025. That said, I don't believe we've reached that point. This team plays with its food a bit and seems to play down to its competition at times, but this is still a championship-caliber roster.\nIf anything, this could be an instance where Green Bay was looking ahead a bit to its Week 10 opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles, on \"Monday Night Football,\" and was caught sleeping by Carolina. Something tells me it'll look far more competitive next time out against an elite NFC team.Drake London is the most underrated No. 1 WROverreaction or reality: Reality \nDrake London is one of the most prolific wide receivers in the NFL and gets little to no attention when speaking about the top players in the league at his position. On Sunday, the former first-rounder hauled in nine passes for 118 yards and three touchdowns. And they weren't gimme scores either, as London had to make circus catch after circus catch to get his team on the board.\nAtlanta is still in the shadow of the Buccaneers in the NFC South, so the attention isn't on the Falcons routinely from a national perspective, but London should be pushed further into the conversation when speaking about the top-five wideouts in the NFL. \nThe Bears were right to draft Colston Loveland over Tyler WarrenOverreaction or reality: Overreaction\nThe Chicago Bears have been ribbed throughout the first two months of the regular season after selecting Colston Loveland with the No. 10 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft instead of fellow tight end Tyler Warren, who went No. 14 overall to the Indianapolis Colts. That's because Warren has been among the more prolific players at his position in the league, while Loveland's first six games were far more muted. However, the Michigan product enjoyed his breakout in Week 9, catching six of his seven targets for 118 yards and two touchdowns. That included a game-winning 58-yard touchdown in the final minute of regulation.\nAre those Warren backers eating a little crow today? Sure. Does this performance mean Chicago was right to take Loveland over him? No. That will play out over the next few seasons, and while Warren has enjoyed the better start to his career, Loveland did send a little reminder on Sunday to not count him out.\nJosh Allen has officially drawn even with Patrick MahomesOverreaction or reality: Overreaction\nAllen was stellar in Buffalo's 28-21 victory over Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bills quarterback had as many incompletions (three) as he did total touchdowns. The win moves him to 5-5 all-time against Mahomes while no other signal-caller has more than three victories against the Chiefs' quarterback. Does this mean Allen suddenly has the edge over his main rival now that they're even? Not yet. Allen is 5-1 against Mahomes in the regular season. When these two go toe-to-toe in the playoffs, Mahomes has come out victorious in all four instances. Until Allen gets the better of Mahomes when it matters most, he'll still be looking up to him in this legendary rivalry despite the overall lockstep record. Matthew Stafford is putting together an MVP seasonOverreaction or reality: Reality\nStafford has quietly put himself firmly in the MVP race. The Rams quarterback has logged back-to-back games with four or more passing touchdowns and has 21 this season through eight starts, which exceeds his output from all of last season (20 in 16 starts). Over the last five games, Stafford has thrown for 16 scores compared to zero interceptions. He's the second player in the last 10 seasons to have a five-game stretch of 15 or more touchdowns with no picks. The other was Aaron Rodgers in 2021, who went on to win MVP. On top of the prolific touchdown numbers, Stafford has the Rams in the playoff picture, fighting for first place in the NFC West. If they take command of the division, it'll only further cement his case. J.J. McCarthy has put the NFC North on noticeOverreaction or reality: Reality\nWhat a difference a day can make in the NFC North. Coming into Sunday, the Vikings were at the bottom of the division and the only club under .500 at 3-4. However, fast-forward through the afternoon and J.J. McCarthy helped lead Minnesota to an upset win over the Lions on the road. \nWhile they still sit in fourth, the Vikings are suddenly back at .500 and firmly in the mix in the NFC North race after Green Bay lost as well. Just as important, McCarthy looked good in his return. The second-year quarterback had been sidelined since Week 2 due to a high ankle sprain and didn't look like he had any limitations. While his passing numbers were not eye-popping (just 143 yards through the air), McCarthy connected on two touchdowns and added another on the ground.McCarthy's day wasn't perfect, as he tossed an interception and fumbled (recovered), but that's sort of what should put the rest of the division on notice. The Vikings can get slightly above-average play at quarterback and go into hostile, divisional road environments and win. Sneakily, Minnesota has a 2-0 record in the NFC North, the best in the division. Christian McCaffrey has overtaken Jonathan Taylor in the OPOY raceOverreaction or reality: Overreaction\nJonathan Taylor has been otherworldly through the first half of the season, to the point where he's been in MVP conversations. However, he may be starting to lose some ground in the Offensive Player of the Year race to Christian McCaffrey. \nWhile he hasn't been overtaken yet, Taylor's quiet outing in Week 9 gives McCaffrey a bit of a lane. The 49ers back continues to be one of the biggest weapons in the NFL, rushing for 106 yards and a touchdown against the Giants, while also catching five of his six targets for 67 yards and another score. McCaffrey now leads all players with 1,222 yards from scrimmage this season. This was also his 16th career game with a rushing and receiving touchdown, passing Marshall Faulk for the most in NFL history. Taylor still has a slight lead, but it's getting tighter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Auburn is heading back to the coaching carousel after Hugh Freeze was fired during his third year with the program. The Tigers went 15-19 under Freeze, including a paltry 6-15 in SEC play. Now, they're set to hire their fourth coach in five years. Freeze was an unexpected hire when he returned to the SEC more than six years after he was fired from Ole Miss in the midst of both personal and professional scandals. At Auburn, he was unable to recapture the magic of his Rebels run, never beating Alabama and not even posting a winning record in three years. In fact, his success almost exactly mirrored Bryan Harsin, who was run out in Year 2. The next coach at Auburn faces an intriguing moment. They will have to rebuild the identity of the program in a highly competitive SEC. Like Freeze and Harsin before, they will have to do it in the shadow of national title contenders at Alabama and Georgia. \n        \n            \n                As college football coaching carousel spins, discussion of representation takes a new twist\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAuburn won a national championship in 2010 and returned to the title game in 2013. There is championship upside in the program, but a new coach will have to rebuild it from the ground up. Below is a compilation of coaches from CBS Sports Insiders who could quickly find themselves on Auburn's radar. \nFormer Texas A&M coach Jimbo FisherFisher's tenure at Texas A&M ended in disastrous fashion after he was paid the biggest buyout in college football history to go away. In his final two seasons after signing the No. 1 recruiting class in history, Fisher went 11-15, including 6-9 in SEC play. But while his recent work has been underwhelming, Fisher remains one of the most successful coaches of the 21st century. At Florida State, Fisher went 83-23 and won the 2013 national championship. He also led the Aggies to a No. 4 finish and Orange Bowl victory in 2020, ranking among their best Aggies seasons of the past 30 years. His 2013 team is one of the most talented rosters ever. If Fisher went to Auburn, he'd quickly be one of the top recruiters in the SEC again. Coming back to college football wouldn't be about money for Fisher -- it would be about reclaiming his name. Auburn could use a coach with a big chip on his shoulder. \nFormer Penn State coach James FranklinWhen Penn State unceremoniously fired Franklin, he said his new goal was simply to go win a national championship somewhere else. Auburn is a program with championship upside, and Franklin checks many of the most important boxes for the program -- namely building a robust football organization. Franklin is one of the highest-floor coaches in college football, posting six 10-win seasons and five AP top 10 finishes at Penn State. He also previously led Vanderbilt to 18 wins in two years and reached the national semifinals in 2025. Auburn would more than take Franklin leading the Tigers back to 10-win contention consistently after arguably the most embarrassing stretch in program history. Missouri coach Eli DrinkwitzA Gus Malzahn disciple, Drinkwitz has created some of the most dynamic teams in the SEC since arriving at Missouri in 2020. The Tigers are 27-6 over the past three seasons, including a Cotton Bowl victory and AP Top 10 finish in 2023. The program is also on the edge of College Football Playoff contention during another hot start to 2025. \nAt Auburn, he would be able to expand his recruiting chops and compete for the best players in the country. Furthermore, Drinkwitz has a trash-talking personality that would immediately become beloved at Auburn, especially in contrast to the cool Kalen DeBoer at Alabama. Auburn is at its best when the program is swinging for the fences. Tulane coach Jon SumrallSumrall is one of the fastest-rising coaches in college football after sensational coaching jobs at Troy and Tulane. He is high on the team's early hot board, according to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The Huntsville, Alabama, native took over a Troy program coming off three straight losing seasons and quickly flipped them into a winner, posting a 23-4 record with two Sun Belt titles in two seasons. The next year, he went to Tulane and led the program to the American title game with a 8-5 record, including 7-1 in American play. The former Kentucky linebacker has deep experience in the SEC, working as defensive coordinator under Mark Stoops and linebackers coach at Ole Miss. He has built physical defensive teams that control games but has consistently found great offensive coordinators and players as a head coach, including quarterback Darian Mensah, running back Makhi Hughes and running back Kimani Vidal. \nAlso, Sumrall's wife went to Auburn. Understanding The Plains never hurts. Arizona State coach Kenny DillinghamThe former Auburn offensive coordinator has quickly become one of the fastest-rising coaches in college football. Dillingham led his alma mater to a Big 12 championship and College Football Playoff appearance in Year 2, culminating with a double-overtime loss to Texas in the quarterfinals. Injuries have derailed Arizona State's 2025, but the Sun Devils still managed to outlast Iowa State with a backup quarterback. Dillingham would be the exact kind of young, exciting offensive mind that attracts elite quarterbacks to The Plains. However, his greatest strengths are as an administrator and communicator, which would allow him to build an elite SEC staff. He has coached under Mike Norvell, Dan Lanning and Gus Malzahn. Georgia Tech coach Brent KeyThe Yellow Jackets' CFP hopes took a major shot after a loss to NC State in Week 10, but Key has still done a sensational job in Atlanta. Georgia Tech reached No. 7 in the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2009 and have built a big, physical identity behind the former offensive line coach. \nKey has plenty of experience recruiting the Deep South, including the all-important Atlanta metro. He also served as offensive line coach at Alabama -- it never hurts to have some Nick Saban bonafides in that state. More than anything, Key would quickly develop a strong identity in the program. South Florida coach Alex GoleshGolesh has sped back up coaching boards after leading one of the best Group of Six teams in the country. The Bulls went from 7-6 in each of the past two seasons to a 6-2 start, including major upset victory against Florida in nonconference play. South Florida was coming off a 4-29 record in three seasons before Golesh; he has posted a 20-14 record. The former Tennessee offensive coordinator boasts one of the most interesting backgrounds in the sport. Golesh was born in Russia and grew up in Ohio. He primarily coached in the Midwest before joining Josh Heupel at UCF in 2020. Now, he brings a diversified offense that embraces aspects of Tennessee's veer-and-shoot, but plenty of physical running from the Toledo tree. Golesh has also established himself as a dynamite recruiter in The American. \n\n    \n                                        \n    The Auburn Tigers are searching for their next head football coach following the dismissal of Hugh Freeze.

    "body": "\n        Auburn is firing coach Hugh Freeze just one day after the Tigers mustered three points in a disappointing home loss to Kentucky, the program's fifth setback in six games this season against SEC competition, CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello, Matt Zenitz and Richard Johnson report. \"I have informed Coach Freeze of my decision to make a change in leadership with the Auburn Football program,\" Auburn athletic director John Cohen said in a statement released by the school. \"Coach Freeze is a man of integrity, and we are appreciative of his investment in Auburn and his relentless work over the last three years in bolstering our roster. Our expectations for Auburn Football are to annually compete for championships and the search for the next leader of Auburn Football begins immediately.\"The Tigers dropped to 1-5 in conference play in the middle of Freeze's third season with bowl hopes hanging by a thread at 4-5 overall with games against Vanderbilt, Mercer and Alabama remaining. Auburn had won 19 of its previous 20 matchups with Kentucky dating back to 1967.Defensive coordinator DJ Durkin will serve as the team's interim coach, Marcello reports. \nThis will be the third time since 2020 that the Tigers will be searching for a new coach, which means Auburn will be footing the bill for another sizable buyout as well.Freeze's buyout at Auburn is $15.4 million, almost identical to the total the Tigers paid out to Bryan Harsin eight games into his second season in 2022 amid inner program failures and on-field struggles. Freeze signed a six-year deal that same year worth $39 million.Firing chants from the student section broke out during Auburn's loss to Kentucky and lingered even after the final whistle. The Wildcats notched seven sacks against a sputtering offense led by Stanford transfer Ashton Daniels, who made his first start for Auburn amid season-long issues with Jackson Arnold.\nIn short, Freeze's new-look offense infused with portal talent never got off the ground in 2025. After strong efforts on the recruiting trail in recent years, Auburn's 2026 efforts have been poor; what on Sunday was a 14-man class was tracking to be the school's worst in the 247Sports era (2010-). \"I wish I could ask for patience, but that's not really something people want to give in this day and time, but I understand that,\" Freeze said after the game in his plea to fans. \"I just know we're so dang close, and if we had a few things go our way earlier in the year, we're looking at a whole different deal. But it didn't, and that's life. And that's the game of football and it teaches us a lot of great things and a lot of tough things. We'll get up and go get ready for the next one.\"I'd love for their patience. But I understand that you're probably not getting patience from them, because they want to see a better product on the field and so do I. So, I understand it.\"\nAuburn lost at least four games during SEC play in each of Freeze's seasons, which set a new low mark for the program. Freeze leaves Auburn with a 15-19 overall record, including a 6-16 showing in conference play. That's the worst three-year start for an Auburn coach since 1951-53, when Ralph Jordan went 14-16-1. Jordan, a College Football Hall of Famer, showed progress in that third year with a 7-3-1 record, though, and led the Tigers until he retired following the 1975 season. Freeze is also the first Auburn coach since 1950 to last at least three seasons without a winning record against league opponents. \nFreeze's tenure as Auburn coach SeasonOverall recordSEC recordBowl20236-73-5Music City Bowl (13-31 vs. Maryland)20245-72-6No bowl20254-51-5--Auburn entered the 2025 season with lofty expectations thanks to Freeze's recruiting efforts and what appeared to be -- on paper, at least -- an improved offense. The Tigers boasted one of college football's deepest wide receiver rooms, highlighted by stars like Cam Coleman and top transfer addition Eric Singleton. They also took a big swing by landing former five-star prospect and Oklahoma starter Jackson Arnold at quarterback. Auburn even climbed as high as No. 22 in the AP Top 25 amid a 3-0 start in nonconference play, highlighted by an impressive road win against Baylor in which the Tigers scored 38 points. Then, they hit a wall. They failed to score 20 points in each of their first four SEC games. Arnold went three straight games, from Auburn's Sept. 27 loss to Texas A&M to its loss against Missouri, without a single passing touchdown. Arnold was also benched against Arkansas, as the Tigers turned to former Stanford transfer Ashton Daniels late in the first half. Auburn is the third SEC school to make a midseason coaching change in 2025, following in the footsteps of the Razorbacks, which moved on from Sam Pittman on Sept. 28, and Florida, which fired Billy Napier two weeks ago. High on Auburn's board? Jon SumrallSumrall is one of the fastest-rising coaches in college football after sensational coaching jobs at Troy and Tulane. He is high on the team's early hot board, according to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The Huntsville, Alabama, native took over a Troy program coming off three straight losing seasons and quickly flipped them into a winner, posting a 23-4 record with two Sun Belt titles in two seasons. The next year, he went to Tulane and led the program to the American title game with a 8-5 record, including 7-1 in American play. The former Kentucky linebacker has deep experience in the SEC, working as defensive coordinator under Mark Stoops and linebackers coach at Ole Miss. He has built physical defensive teams that control games but has consistently found great offensive coordinators and players as a head coach, including quarterback Darian Mensah, running back Makhi Hughes and running back Kimani Vidal. -- Shehan JeyarajahWhat's next for Freeze?The 56-year-old is a controversial college football figure whose long track record of success feels more distant with each blunder he makes (coaches across the country still cannot figure out why Freeze refused to reevaluate a collaborative play-calling approach). Be skeptical there's much of a market for Freeze as a head coach moving forward -- and it's also unclear if Freeze will want to coach again any time soon. Freeze was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February and is currently undergoing treatment. Doctors caught it early and he opted against immediate surgery to have the mass removed. That's because the cancer was deemed low aggressive, per Freeze. He said back in the summer he planned to reevaluate his health in January.As for a potential future in coaching, maybe Freeze could emerge as a candidate at a G-5 program. He found outsized success in past stints at Arkansas State and Liberty. But checking with industry sources, it's hard to see Freeze making an immediate return as a Power Four head coach. He won't have the cachet of Franklin or a Kelly, and his baggage is immense. -- Chris Hummer\n    \n                                        \n    The Auburn Tigers are searching for their next head football coach following the dismissal of Hugh Freeze.

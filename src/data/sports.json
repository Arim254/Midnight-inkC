    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        After firing Mel Tucker, Michigan State turned to Jonathan Smith to bring some stability to East Lansing and build the Spartans back into a Big Ten threat. As Smith nears the end of his second season, Michigan State has shown little in the way of progress as a 28-10 loss on Saturday night to a struggling Penn State squad with an interim coach dropped them to 3-7 (0-7 Big Ten) and guaranteed a second consecutive losing season under Smith's watch. Morale around the Spartans football program is at a low point, as fans grow concerned they've been lapped by the top teams in the Big Ten. As the losses have piled up and the Spartans haven't looked particularly close to a breakthrough -- six of their seven losses have been by double digits -- Smith has found his seat getting hotter by the week. That's led Michigan State fans to wonder if it's time for another coaching search, even with a highly competitive coaching carousel already forming. \nJonathan Smith buyout, contract detailsSmith signed a seven-year, $52.8 million contract in 2024 that still has $38.25 million left on it after this season. Smith's buyout clause calls for him to get paid 85% of his remaining contract, which would put Michigan State on the hook fro just over $32.5 million, payable in monthly installments through 2030. There is offset language in the contract for anything Smith makes in a future job in college or the NFL, which should mitigate some of the cost, but that's still a sizable buyout for Michigan State. Michigan State would have to feel confident they could land an upgrade over Smith to pay that much to get rid of him. The number of Power Four vacancies is already at nine, and if Michigan State made it 10 they would be closer the bottom of that list than the top in terms of how desirable the job is. Still, the lack of any discernible improvement from Year 1 to Year 2 of Smith's tenure is concerning for those around the Spartans program. If they don't feel like a turnaround is coming in 2026 with what they have on the roster and what's coming in recruiting, perhaps they'll be willing to roll the dice on another spin around the coaching carousel. \nSmith's two seasons in East Lansing have not helped raise his profile on the coaching market, but he could look to return to Oregon State as the Beavers job is open again and would be an intriguing candidate for other teams in the Group of Six. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Texas A&M and coach Mike Elko have agreed to a contract extension that makes him one of the 10 highest-paid coaches in college football, the school announced on Saturday. The deal was announced shortly after the No. 3 Aggies completed the largest comeback in school history, storming back from a 27-point deficit in the second to defeat South Carolina. The extension solidifies Elko's long-term role at Texas A&M amid a coaching carousel full of turbulence. Since arriving in College Station, Elko compiled a 17-5 overall record, quickly leading the Aggies into national contender status. Texas A&M is off to a 9-0 start and sits No. 3 in the College Football Playoff rankings, putting the program on the verge of its first CFP appearance and SEC Championship Game appearance. The new deal comes as Elko's profile surged, making the timing a strategic move for Texas A&M to prevent suitors from entering the picture, specifically Penn State, a program seen as a natural fit because of Elko's long-standing connections to the Northeast.\"I want to extend my sincere appreciation to interim President Tommy Williams, Chancellor Glenn Hegar, the Texas A&M Board of Regents, and Director of Athletics Trev Alberts for their confidence in me and our staff for the direction we're taking this program,\" Elko said in a statement. \"Texas A&M has the potential to be one of the nation's premier football brands and a consistent contender for championships. This commitment of resources allows us to continue elevating our program toward that goal. From day one, our mission has been to establish a standard of excellence that reflects the passion and pride of the 12th Man, and this support moves us even further along that path.\"\nElko earns roughly $7 million annually on a heavily incentive-based contract -- one that ranked him just 32nd among FBS head coaches. The new agreement, however, is expected to include a substantial increase in guaranteed compensation, according to Yahoo Sports, elevating him into the top tier of coaching salaries across the country.The commitment reflects both Texas A&M's belief in Elko's long-term vision and the broader landscape of this coaching cycle, where few established candidates have been available for major openings. Holding onto Elko not only stabilizes the program but also secures continuity at a time when the Aggies appear to be trending toward their most promising season in decades.\nElko quickly reshaped Texas A&M into a physical team that mirrors the defensive identity he built during earlier stops at Duke and during his previous stint as the Aggies' defensive coordinator. With recruiting momentum building and national relevance restored, the Aggies are moving to ensure that Elko remains the face of the program well beyond 2025.\n            \n    ",

The battle is dripping with intrigue as both are again firmly in the league title hunt and College Football Playoff picture.Texas is coming off a bye and riding a four-game SEC winning streak that has rekindled CFP hopes that were teetering following a 3-2 start. Consecutive solid outings from quarterback Arch Manning have inspired hope that the Longhorns could still reach championship heights.Bet Texas vs. Georgia at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:However, a loss between the hedges would all but eliminate the Longhorns from the SEC title picture and significantly imperil their CFP aspirations. Taking down Georgia on the road will be a gargantuan task, especially considering how well the Bulldogs played last week. UGA's 41-21 win at Mississippi State included a stretch of 38 consecutive points. With a healthy offensive line and reinvigorated rushing attack, Georgia is showing flashes of being a complete offensive team.\nThe Bulldogs got the best of Texas twice last season, once at Texas and once in Atlanta for the SEC Championship Game. Now they meet in Athens for the first time as Georgia seeks to win its third straight against the Longhorns and even the all-time series at 4-4.Where to watch Georgia vs. Texas liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Sanford Stadium -- Athens, GeorgiaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow along for live updates, highlights and analysis from this huge SEC clash. \n  Georgia vs. Texas: Need to know  Georgia's defensive line: The Bulldogs are navigating life without starting nose tackle Jordan Hall, who will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury suffered in Georgia's win over Florida. However, UGA managed its first game without him well by generating three sacks and holding Mississippi State's run game in check last week. Pressuring the quarterback isn't this group's strength, but Georgia has proven to be strong against the run, ranking 12th nationally in rush defense. The Longhorns have struggled to run the ball effectively against SEC opposition, and changing that against Georgia won't be easy.Texas' passing game: Texas quarterback Arch Manning is coming off consecutive 300-plus yard, three-touchdown performances in critical SEC victories. However, the Longhorns' downfield passing attack is still a work in progress. Of Manning's 328 passing yards in a 34-31 win over Vanderbilt, 258 came on yards after the catch as the Commodores struggled to tackle. Georgia is better equipped on the perimeter defensively to handle the swing passes and quick hits that have defined Manning's recent renaissance. Is he capable of making the Bulldogs pay by connecting on a few deep shots?CFP implications: Even with a loss to Texas, Georgia's path to the playoff would remain viable. The Bulldogs would need to beat Charlotte next week and close with a win over rival Georgia Tech. At 10-2 and with a victories over the No. 16 Yellow Jackets, No. 7 Ole Miss and No. 23 Tennessee, the Bulldogs would have a strong at-large resume. However, the picture is decidedly cloudier for Texas if the Longhorns lose. Even at 9-3 with potential wins over Arkansas and Texas A&M to close the season, the Longhorns would be on shaky ground. Wins over No. 11 Oklahoma, No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 14 Vanderbilt might be get them in as a three-loss team. But Texas would likely need some help in the form of losses from other at-large candidates.\nGeorgia vs. Texas prediction, picks  \nArch Manning's recent surge in performance is largely based on yards after the catch accrued by his receivers against two of the least athletic defenses in the SEC. The Longhorns won't be able to run the football against Georgia, and the Bulldogs have the athletes required to make tackles in space against UT's horizontal passing attack. Furthermore, Georgia's offense has been unstoppable in two of its past three games. The Bulldogs are finding their stride and will handle business as a home favorite under the lights. Pick: Georgia -6Bet Georgia vs. Texas at Fanatics Sportsbook, where new users get up to $2,000 in

    "body": "\n        Two of the most efficient offenses and two of college basketball's best coaches will meet in a top-10 showdown Saturday night from Boston at TD Garden as No. 3 UConn and No. 7 BYU square off in what is shaping up to be the biggest game of the weekend in college basketball. The No. 3 Huskies (3-0) and No. 7 Cougars (3-0) own the No. 4 and No. 8 offensive units in adjusted efficiency metrics at KenPom.com in the early going of the season. And armed with stars on both sides -- Tarris Reed Jr., Solo Ball and Alex Karaban for UConn, and AJ Dybantsa, Robert Wright III and Richie Saunders for BYU -- the game is emitting distinct second-weekend-of-the-NCAA-Tournament vibes. If that's not enough to get your heart racing you may need to get a pulse check. Here is everything you need to know about Saturday's showdown from TD Garden.   Where to watch UConn vs. BYU  live   Date: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 7 p.m. ET    Location: TD Garden -- Boston, Massachusetts  \tTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  UConn vs. BYU: Need to know UConn's two-way dynamism: UConn has had a top-25 offensive unit in each of the last five seasons under Dan Hurley. To be expected. Ho-hum. But its defense -- outside of the two title seasons in 2022-23 and 2023-24 -- has been a hindrance to the Huskies. That doesn't appear to be the case this season. This UConn team in addition to its potent offense is currently No. 13 in adjusted defensive efficiency at KenPom and so far is top-50 in defending the 3-point line and top-15 on 2s. That will be put to the test in a big way vs. BYU's attack that can generate offense both inside and out.   \nDybantsa showtime debut: BYU star freshman AJ Dybantsa, the No. 2 recruit in his class and a strong contender to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, is set for his first major spotlight on primetime against a top-10 team. We wait with bated breath to see how he fares. He's averaging 18.7 points and 7.0 rebounds per game in three outings so far for the Cougars -- but UConn coach Dan Hurley will no doubt have a gameplan to try and limit him in this one.     Sharing is caring: It sounds like an oversimplification -- and perhaps it is! -- but UConn has been an elite ball-moving team on offense the last three seasons. It runs complex, long-developing sets and its success is predicated on moving without the ball and swinging it to get the defense off kilter. Doing that vs. BYU with success will be an early indicator as to how the Cougars can match up defensively. Even the best defenses have trouble slowing this UConn offense because of its sets and its counters. My prediction: BYU will have to force UConn into an uncharacteristically high number of turnovers to keep pace.   UConn vs. BYU prediction, pick \nOdds via Caesars SportsbookMy prediction is that while BYU falls in a close one, it keeps it within the number. This is a talented BYU team that can score with UConn when it is on its game even against an improved UConn defense. Huskies win, Cougars cover. This feels like a shootout that goes final at, say, 84-80.

    "body": "\n        The latest FanDuel promo code gives new users $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Texas vs. Georgia is garnering the majority of the attention of the college football world on Saturday, but it's not the only game. The No. 1 team in the nation takes the field on Saturday, and although it's not going as far as to pick an upset, SportsLine's model is expecting a closer game than many may be expecting. The model has UCLA in its Saturday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook to hang around with No. 1 Ohio State, playing UCLA as 34.5-point underdogs. Ohio State is 9-0 this season, but the Buckeyes are 1-2 against the spread when favored by more than 25 points.The model has a best bet on the top-10 matchup of Georgia vs. Texas as well, backing the Longhorns as 4.5-point underdogs in its Saturday best bets at FanDuel. It is also backing Boise State to upset San Diego State at +106 odds in a 10:30 p.m. ET kickoff. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

The Bruins are 3-3 in the Big Ten, with two of their three conference losses coming in one-score contests. They are 3-1 ATS as an underdog in conference play this season. UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava was the No. 2 recruit in the nation in the Class of 2023, only behind Arch Manning, and although he hasn't fully lived up to those expectations early into his college career, he still has that potential. Ohio State is great, but UCLA can make enough plays to cover this margin. The model projects UCLA to cover the spread in 66% of simulations. Back UCLA at FanDuel Sportsbook:Texas +4.5 vs. Georgia (-115)Speaking of Arch Manning, he'll take the field as an underdog around the same time as Iamaleava. Manning is coming off two of the best performances of his collegiate career, throwing for 328 yards and three touchdowns against No. 9 Vanderbilt last week after a career-high 346 yards and three touchdowns the week before against Mississippi State. Georgia often has one of the top defenses in the nation, and this year is no exception, with a top-30 scoring defense in the nation. But No. 10 Texas has won each of its last two games against top-10 ranked teams heading into a matchup against No. 5 Georgia. The model projects Texas to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. Back Texas at FanDuel Sportsbook:Boise State +106 vs. San Diego StateThis matchup of the top two teams in the Mountain West will be a highly competitive 10:30 p.m. ET start on CBS Sports Network, with both teams at 4-1 in conference play this year. Boise State is coming off suffering its first conference loss of the season in a 30-7 final against Fresno State, which also snapped its three-game winning streak and six-game winning streak against unranked teams. That game was on Nov. 1, though, so the Broncos had time to regroup and prepare for this conference showdown. Meanwhile, San Diego State is coming off its first conference loss of the season, which came last week in a 38-6 demolition by Hawaii. The model projects Boise State to win in 67% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds.\nWant more college football picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\n        Legacies are on the line Saturday at UFC 322 as two fighters look to join the exclusive group of fighters who have held UFC championships in two different weight classes. In the main event, former lightweight champion Islam Makhachev moves up to welterweight to challenge champion Jack Della Maddalena. The co-main event features Zhang Weili jumping from strawweight to flyweight to face champ Valentina Shevchenko.Della Maddalena is making the first defense of his title, which he won by dominating Belal Muhammad in May. Makhachev vacated the lightweight title after an incredible run as champion.Meanwhile, Zhang and Shevchenko have had similar career runs in UFC. Both are among the most decorated champions in the strawweight and flyweight division's history. They have each made numerous title defenses while coming up on the wrong end of a pair of fights with their toughest rivals (Rose Namajunas for Zhang and Amanda Nunes for Shevchenko). Saturday could go a long way in polishing off an already Hall of Fame worthy resume for either woman.Saturday night will see tons of top welterweights in action looking to make a strong impression on the matchmakers for a possible title shot. No. 2 Sean Brady has the tall task of slowing the momentum of No. 8 Michael Morales in a featured bout. Morales, 26, is 18-0 and coming off a pair of Performance of the Night awards in his last two outings. Plus, former divisional champion Leon Edwards looks to get back on track when he takes on another fast riser in Carlos Prates. Edwards has dropped two in a row after defending the 170-pound title twice. Prates, meanwhile, bounced back from his first UFC defeat in April when he delivered a thunderous knockout of Geoff Neal in August.\nWith such an intriguing card, we once again looked at the full main card to deliver our best bets for each of the five main card fights on the UFC 322 card.After going 3-1 for our best bets for UFC 321, our 2025 record sits at 27-20. We'll look keep our roll going on Saturday, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Beneil Dariush\tvs.\tBenoit Saint DenisBenoit Saint Denis moneyline (-192)Saint Denis built a lot of excitement over a five-fight winning streak that saw him flash good striking and a solid ground game. With some buzz building that he could be a future title contender, Saint Denis was given a brutal reality check when he was stopped by Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano in back-to-back fights. Since those losses, Saint Denis has picked up a pair of submission wins to begin to build momentum again. Dariush's story is not dissimilar, emerging as a title contender while riding an eight-fight winning streak before first-round knockout losses to Charles Oliveira and Arman Tsarukyan. Dariush got back in the win column in his most recent fight, taking a decision over Moicano. Dariush has faced a better level of opposition overall, but he's the older man and Saint Denis has a decided edge in power. With wrestling games that likely cancel each other out, I lean toward taking Saint Denis' striking to carry the day.\nLeon Edwards vs. Carlos PratesLeon Edwards via decision (+275)This is a very stereotypical crossroads matchup, with Edwards as the old veteran seemingly on the downside of his career. After winning the welterweight championship against Kamaru Usman, defending it in the rematch and taking care of Colby Covington, Edwards lost the title to Belal Muhammad before being submitted by Sean Brady in March. Prates is only two years younger than Edwards, but he's the fighter on the upswing, looking to take out a former champion and emerge as a potential title challenger. Prates is a flashy striker who has scored a knockout in his 11 most recent victories. Edwards is a patient, technical striker who has an underrated wrestling game. Prates' lone UFC loss came against Ian Machado Garry, who utilized a gameplan of mixing up striking and wrestling to tire Prates out while not allowing him to get his big strikes going. That's a very easy gameplan for Edwards to follow with his skills. If Edwards wins, it seems most likely he does it on the scorecards, so that's the play.\n        \n            \n                UFC 322: A look at champions who have earned second division title and those who came up short\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSean Brady\tvs.\tMichael MoralesSean Brady moneyline (-135)The great matchmaking at UFC 322 continues with this pivotal welterweight clash. Brady is ranked No. 2 at welterweight in the UFC's official rankings while Morales sits at No. 8. The fighters have a combined 36-1 record with 23 wins by stoppage. Brady is already in line for a title shot, though Makhachev's decision to move to the division allowed him to jump the line -- and Brady. To maintain his spot, Brady will have to overcome a similarly aggressive opponent who has yet to taste defeat. This fight may come down to wrestling. Brady averages more than 3.5 takedowns per 15 minutes while Morales defends takedowns at a success rate of 89%. Of course, Morales hasn't faced a murderer's row of great wrestlers and Brady presents a host of new tests for the Ecuadorian. Brady is more battle-tested against better opposition, and -135 feels like a good price on the higher-ranked, more proven fighter.Valentina Shevchenko vs.\tZhang WeiliFight to go the distance: Yes (-225)The fight to go over 4.5 rounds is -270, so you're getting a much better price to bet on that final 2:30 ticking away. These are two of the best fighters in the history of women's MMA. Shevchenko hasn't picked up a stoppage win since September 2021. Weili has more recent stoppages, but is also coming up a division to challenge for Shevchenko's title. Two skilled fighters in a division with a low stoppage rate makes betting on the full five rounds a solid play. Shevchenko is also very good at slowing down explosive strikers, and if Weili can't be explosive on the feet, the chances of a stoppage plummet. It would be a surprise if Shevchenko is drawn into extended firefights and will likely look to grind on Weili along the cage and work takedowns. All of that adds up to a fight that goes to the scorecards.\nJack Della Maddalena vs.\tIslam MakhachevOver 3.5 rounds (-135)I want to pull the trigger on Della Maddalena at +230 because of a nagging feeling that he presents some of the problems that troubled Makhachev in the first fight with Alexander Volkanovski. Della Maddalena isn't the wrestler Volkanovski is, but he is solid on the ground and has very good striking. Makhachev looks like he has bulked up appropriately ahead of vying for 170-pound gold, and his wrestling and top game is as good as almost anyone in the world. That's all holding me back from making the upset our best bet pick. Instead, we're taking the fight to go over 3.5 rounds, relying on Della Maddalena to be able to survive some uncomfortable positions while winning some exchanges on the feet. Makhachev may wear Della Maddalena down over time and find the stoppage, but I'm not seeing it happening early. And, if you're feeling spicy, you can fire an extra bullet on the upset.Who wins UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.\n            ",

And that's the case once again on Saturday when UFC makes its annual trip to Madison Square Garden for UFC 322. A pair of superfights tip the bill with (now) former champions moving up in weight in pursuit of glory in a second division. In the main event, Islam Makhachev moves up from lightweight to welterweight to challenge Jack Della Maddalena for the 170-pound title. In the co-main, Weili Zhang moves from strawweight to flyweight to face Valentina Shevchenko for the 125-pound crown.Makhachev is on the short list of best lightweight fighters in UFC history, along with his mentor and coach Khabib Nurmagomedov. Makhachev set the record for most title defenses in the division before deciding to move up 15 pounds in weight to challenge for a second divisional crown. If he wins on Saturday, he also ties Anderson Silva for the longest win streak in UFC history at 16. Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage of UFC 322, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!Standing in his way is Della Maddalena, who is a bit of an unheralded champion after earning the title in his last fight against Belal Muhammad. \"JDM\" is undefeated in UFC since joining the promotion in 2022 and brings a unique skillset that could bother Makhachev.\nPlus, Zhang and Shevchenko represent two of the best women's fighters in promotional history with numerous title defenses at both strawweight and flyweight.

    "body": "\n        Seattle Seahawks legend Kenny \"The Enforcer\" Easley has died at the age of 66, the team announced on Saturday. The Hall of Fame safety played for the Seahawks from 1981-87 before retiring at the age of 28.\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Seahawks Legend Kenny Easley,\" the Seahawks wrote in a statement. \"Kenny embodied what it meant to be a Seahawk through his leadership, intensity, and fearlessness. His intimidating nature and athletic grace made him one of the best players of all-time.\"\nThe Seahawks selected Easley with the No. 4 overall pick in the 1981 NFL Draft, and he immediately became a star in the defensive backfield. As a rookie, Easley recorded three interceptions and four fumble recoveries, and he finished fourth in Defensive Rookie of the Year voting.Easley really broke out two years later when he earned the first of three consecutive first-team All-Pro honors. In that span, Easley recorded 19 interceptions, seven forced fumbles, five fumble recoveries and two defensive touchdowns. In 1984, Easley led the NFL in interceptions with 10.The Seahawks had their first real run of success with Easley acting as a ballhawk in Chuck Knox's defense, and that was no coincidence. He was a stalwart on that side of the ball, and Easley helped Seattle reach its first conference title game in 1983.\nEasley's NFL career lasted just six seasons as injury issues and kidney disease took their toll. The Seahawks tried to trade Easley to the then Phoenix Cardinals in 1988, but he failed the physical when his kidney failure was discovered.After his retirement, Easley filed a lawsuit against the Seahawks, claiming the team and its medical staff facilitated his abuse of ibuprofen, which led to his kidney failure. The case was later settled out of court, and Easley received a new kidney in 1990.The lawsuit led to an icy relationship between Easley and the team for over a decade. However, that came to an end in 2002 when the team inducted Easley into the Ring of Honor. After Easley was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, the Seahawks retired his No. 45 later that fall.\nPrior to his success at the NFL level, Easley was a star at UCLA. While with the Bruins, Easley earned All-American honors in three consecutive years from 1978-80. In his last two seasons at UCLA, Easley was a unanimous All-American. Easley still holds the school record for career interceptions with 19, and his 374 tackles are fifth in UCLA history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Texas A&M mounted a comeback for the ages, stunning South Carolina 31-30 at Kyle Field. The Aggies erased a 27-point halftime deficit with a furious second-half surge to stay alive in the SEC title race.The rally stands as the largest comeback in program history, surpassing the 21-point rally engineered by Johnny Manziel in the 2013 Chick-fil-A Bowl. A&M needed every bit of quarterback Marcel Reed's brilliance to close it out, leaning on its dynamic passer after a shaky first half.Here's how Texas A&M pulled off a historic win over South Carolina, preserved its undefeated season and secured its first 10-win campaign since Manziel's Heisman year in 2012.Nightmare finish to the halfThe Aggies couldn't have scripted a worse first half. Texas A&M missed two field goals, surrendered a defensive touchdown on a disastrous play-extension attempt by Reed and threw an interception in the end zone. But for all the early miscues, the final sequence before halftime felt like the dagger.\nA&M took over with 1:06 left in the half and a chance to steal some momentum. The Aggies drove into the red zone trailing 20-3, but Reed floated a pass into the end zone that was intercepted. One play later, LaNorris Sellers hit Nyck Harbor for a swift 80-yard touchdown.\nAll the Aggies had to do was get into halftime. Instead, Reed dropped back twice, ultimately throwing a second interception to Vicari Swain in three plays. South Carolina turned it into a field goal and a 30-3 lead. SEC teams were winless against opponents after going down by 27 points since 2004. \nElko's gambleTexas A&M mercifully got the ball to start the second half and pushed toward midfield. After a holding call on tackle Dametrious Crownover, the drive looked dead. Facing 4th-and-12 near midfield, coach Mike Elko rolled the dice.Offensive coordinator Collin Klein made a gutsy call, dialing up a quarterback draw for his dual-threat passer. Reed recognized a delayed blitz and ripped off a 16-yard run through the heart of the defense to keep the drive alive.South Carolina was flagged for an illegal substitution on the next play, and Reed capitalized with a 27-yard touchdown strike to freshman Izaiah Williams. The Aggies were finally on the board.\nSouth Carolina 30, Texas A&M 10Fourth down stopSouth Carolina was shaken after the decisive drive to start the second half, but had a chance to settle in. Sellers connected on a 25-yard pass to brother Jayden Sellers to get the offense moving and added another 14-yard run to spur a drive into Texas A&M territory. Facing 4th-and-1 at the Texas A&M 30-yard line, coach Shane Beamer opted to take a chance of his own. Instead of leaning on his hulking quarterback, interim offensive coordinator Mike Furrey called a handoff to running back Matt Fuller. Texas A&M stuffed them. Bethel-Roman explodesTexas A&M receiver Ashton Bethel-Roman has played a secondary role behind breakout targets Mario Craver and KC Concepcion. But when his number was called, the redshirt freshman was ready for his close-up.\nAfter the fourth-down stop, the Aggies methodically moved into plus territory. Reed looked up and found Bethel-Roman breaking free for a 39-yard touchdown -- the second-longest play of his career.\nAfter forcing another three-and-out from the South Carolina offense, Bethel-Roman pulled off the longest play of his career. Bethel-Roman took a curl, put his foot into the dirt and broke away for a 76-yard gain through the middle of the South Carolina defense. One play later, Reed found Nate Boerkircher -- of Notre Dame game-winning fame -- for a 14-yard touchdown. Suddenly, this game was wide open. South Carolina 30, Texas A&M 24PI call keys 99-yard driveBy this point, South Carolina was in full meltdown mode. Jayden Sellers managed a rare second-half first down, but the Gamecocks still had to punt. Mason Love then flipped the field with a sensational punt downed at the 1-yard line, giving South Carolina a golden opportunity to seize momentum.\nInstead, a ticky-tack pass interference call on Judge Collier gave the Aggies breathing room. With space to operate, A&M marched down the field. A 25-yard touchdown run was wiped out by a holding call on Chase Bisontis, but it didn't matter — Reed hit Concepcion for a 31-yard strike to set up a 4-yard touchdown run by E.J. Smith.Suddenly, the Aggies were on top for the first time all afternoon.Texas A&M 31, South Carolina 30Defense finishes jobDown only one point, South Carolina had opportunities to get back into the game. But by this point, Seller and the Gamecocks' offense were seeing ghosts. Sellers was sacked on consecutive plays midway through the fourth quarter, forcing them to hand the ball right back to Texas A&M. They got a significant break when a backwards pass by Reed prevented another score, giving South Carolina one last chance with three minutes remaining. \nThere were a few flashes, including an 18-yard pass to Harbor to push towards midfield. But then, the Aggies locked in. Sellers was again sacked on consecutive plays and forced out of the pocket on 4th-and-16 to run harmlessly for a turnover on downs to end the game. Historically important victoryTexas A&M entered the matchup against South Carolina as heavy favorites, but that doesn't make the moment any less significant. The Aggies stayed undefeated, reaching 10-0 for the first time since 1992. The win also virtually locks in a College Football Playoff berth and keeps their SEC title hopes alive.More importantly, Texas A&M proved its championship mettle. The program hasn't won 10 games since 2012 or captured a conference title since 1998. Unlike so many teams before in College Station, this one stayed mentally strong and rose to the occasion.\nThere are still questions to address, but they are fixable. For South Carolina and coach Shane Beamer, though, this loss — and the slide out of bowl eligibility -- may be a setback the staff can't easily recover from.\n            ",

Our Office of Inspector General (OIG) is also aware of the incident and will be further looking into the matter. No additional information will be released at this time.\"\nFollowing an 80-yard Harbor touchdown in the final minute of the second quarter, South Carolina's star wideout exited the end zone and his momentum carried him into the tunnel. He appeared to be in discomfort, holding the back of his right leg. Several of his Gamecock teammates followed him into the tunnel, and then walked with him back toward the field. As the players exited the tunnel, they were faced with a state trooper walking the opposite way. The officer bumped into the players, and then turned around and pointed at them while saying something. \nThis incident was just one of several bizarre things that took place in this conference matchup, as the third-ranked Aggies came back from a 30-3 deficit to win 31-30. Texas A&M outscored South Carolina 28-0 in the second half, making it the largest comeback in program history. Marcel Reed and the A&M offense scored on four consecutive possessions amid an improbable comeback. \nTexas A&M improved to 10-0 with the win while South Carolina fell to 3-7.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Benns finally have a win over the Eubanks. On Saturday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, Conor Benn put on a boxing masterclass to win his rematch with Chris Eubank Jr. by unanimous decision.Benn and Eubank's fathers met in a pair of British superfights in the 1990s, with Chris Eubank Sr. winning a 1990 clash for the WBO middleweight title, and drawing with Nigel Benn in their 1993 rematch. This past April, Eubank Jr. defeated Benn in a thrilling Fight of the Year contender.On Saturday, Benn finally won one for the family by dominating the rematch bell to bell, utilizing smart boxing and his speed against the much larger Eubank.Eubank looked stuck in first gear for much of the fight, moving backward and boxing off his back foot and along the ropes while Benn stayed aggressive and committed to the attack. When Eubank did find occasional moments to land counter shots, Benn absorbed the shots well and returned fire to continue pulling away on the scorecards.While there was little doubt of which way the fight was heading on the scorecards as the final round began, Benn put an exclamation point on his victory in that final frame.\nA jab set up a right hand from Benn that connected behind Eubank's ear, taking away his equilibrium and sending him crashing to the canvas.Eubank was able to beat the count, but was knocked down a second time moments later when another chopping right hand connected. Eubank again beat the count and the bell sounded seconds later, but a 10-7 round only added to the disparity on the official scorecards, which read 119-107, 116-110 and 118-108, all in Benn's favor.\nDespite being the bigger man, Eubank was never able to use his size and was often outmuscled by Benn in the clinch. Eubank looked every bit of his 36 years, and with nearly 40 professional fights on his resume, it's possible time and wear caught up to him.\nBenn, 29, has now defeated everyone he has faced as a professional, getting revenge on Eubank for his lone defeat.\n            ",

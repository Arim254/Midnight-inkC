The Rams have the league's best offense, ranking first in points, total yards and yards per play, and it's a unit that doesn't hurt itself as no one has committed fewer penalties. Matthew Stafford has two touchdowns and no interceptions in each of his last three postseason starts, and the MVP contender is riding a seven-game playoff streak with multiple touchdown passes. This season, Stafford has more TD passes (46) than Carolina has total touchdowns (35) as the Panthers rank 27th in both points scored and total yards. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Panthers can coverIt was just six weeks ago that Carolina upset the Rams as double-digit underdogs, forcing Stafford into three turnovers. The Panthers have 10 ATS wins as an underdog this year, the most in the NFL, and they also have a one-day rest advantage after playing last Saturday. The Rams have lost three of their last four road games, and the Panthers are decidedly more potent on offense at Bank of America Stadium. Five of their six highest point totals this year have come at home, and the most points they scored all year came versus Los Angeles in Week 13. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

Schröder ended up signing a one-year, $5.9 million taxpayer mid-level exception contract with the Boston Celtics instead.\nVideo appeared to show Schröder telling Dončić, \"I'm gonna beat the s--- out of you.\"According to senior NBA Insider for NBA on Prime, Chris Haynes, Dončić was the player Schröder confronted after the game. Dončić ended the game with 34 points, five rebounds and seven assists to Schröder's 11 points, two rebounds and seven assists.\nSchröder will miss games with the Houston Rockets, New York Knicks, and, in no surprise, the Lakers. The Kings are currently 8-30 and in last place in the Western Conference, well behind the fifth-place Lakers, who sit at 23-13.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Is this just how it's going to be with Kansas? Another day, another Darryn Peterson heater. Another day, another Peterson exit in closing time to get the hot pads onto his uncooperative legs. Another day, another loss for a No. 22 Kansas club that is a miraculous last-minute rally against TCU away from having an unfathomable 0-3 record in Big 12 play. This time, it was West Virginia who used a remarkable 16-0 second-half run to give first-year coach Ross Hodge the first true signature win of his tenure. Brenen Lorient (18 points) took care of the first half, and Honor Huff (23 points) handled the second half in WVU's 86-75 victory.It's a Saturday Funday in the country roads, but the story is an all-too-familiar trend that keeps rearing its ugly head with Peterson and Kansas. The potential No. 1 pick has still not been able to start and finish a game. He sat for all but 53 seconds of the final six-plus minutes of regulation. Part of that was certainly tied to fouling Huff while the West Virginia guard was splashing a trey, but Peterson clearly was feeling under the weather.When he was on the floor, Peterson continued to make a hard game look incredibly easy, posting 23 points in 31 minutes. Peterson is up to 158 points in 190 minutes this season. It's one of the most absurd stats of the year, and the connection between Peterson and Melvin Council Jr. looked much more vibrant. Too often this year, Council and Peterson were an either-or dilemma. For long chunks on Saturday, Kansas was getting positive contributions from both of its best guards.\nBut after dropping to 11-5 overall, it's hard to keep Kansas in the top shelf of the Big 12 behemoths, largely because its best player is still not 100% and this defense has been shredded by UCF, TCU and now West Virginia. WVU's offense posted a sizzling 1.28 points per possession, easily the best it's ever managed against a high-major team this season.Pittsburgh: 1.12 points per possessionClemson: 1.01Xavier: 1.00Wake Forest: 1.08Ohio State: 1.06Iowa State: 0.97Cincinnati: 0.97Kansas: 1.29It's not as if Kansas has bad defensive personnel, either. Melvin Council is an excellent point-of-attack defender. Tre White and Peterson have excellent positional size on the perimeter. Flory Bidunga is a fearsome rim protector, and Bryson Tiller is big and rangy. But Kansas' connection on the defensive end is sputtering. A sign of a locked-in defense is its ability to limit 3-point attempts for the best shooter on the scouting report. Kansas had no answer for Huff (4-11 from downtown), and that came four days after TCU's Liutauras Lelevicius drilled five triples himself.\nThat gaping hole better get cleaned up quickly ahead of Tuesday's matchup with sharpshooter Milan Momcilovic and No. 3 Iowa State.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Penn State transfer Chaz Coleman, the No. 1 edge rusher and No. 5 prospect overall in 247Sports' Transfer Rankings, signed with Tennessee on Saturday afternoon, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer. Coleman chose the Vols over Ohio State and South Carolina, which made a late push for Coleman's services. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound Coleman ranks as the top defensive player in the transfer portal. He joins the Vols with three years of eligibility after spending his true freshman season with the Nittany Lions. A former four-star prospect out of Warren, Ohio's Harding High School, Coleman appeared in nine games in his lone season at Penn State. He finished the year with eight total tackles, three for a loss, and one sack in that span. Coleman also forced one fumble and had one pass breakup. Though Coleman is entering a new environment, he should have plenty of familiarity with Tennessee's defense. The Vols recently hired Jim Knowles, who spent the 2025 season at Penn State, as their defensive coordinator. \nTennessee also added former Penn State defensive line coach Andrew Jackson, who mentored Coleman at Penn State, to its defensive staff. \"He's jumped off the screen from the time I first got to be around him, and he's made plays in games,\" Knowles said of Coleman in September. \"He's just a really disruptive guy. I think his progress is going to have to come against teams that are heavier in the run game and more talented in the run game. We're going to have to see how he can hold up in that because I think he can pass rush against anybody.\"Coleman is the seventh transfer to commit to the Vols during the 2026 cycle and the fifth on the defensive side of the ball. He joins linebacker Amare Campbell and defensive lineman Xavier Gilliam as former Nittany Lions headed to Knoxville. \nColeman fills big hole for Tennessee Landing a high-caliber edge rusher was at the top of Tennessee's transfer portal to-do list. Starting EDGE Joshua Josephs is off to the NFL. As is leading sack artist Dominic Bailey, who played on the strong side of Tennessee's defensive line in its previous scheme. The top two options behind Josephs, Caleb Herring and Jordan Ross, both entered the transfer portal when it opened. Herring has yet to find a new home, but Ross -- who grades out as a four-star transfer prospect -- quickly committed to LSU. Herring had four sacks in 2025, which tied for second among Tennessee defenders. Ross' 1.5 sacks don't leap off the page, but he has plenty of upside as a former top-10 prospect in the class of 2024. \nIn Coleman, Tennessee is getting a defender that already has experience in Knowles' complex defensive scheme. He should start immediately, and he could also prove instrumental in helping other players learn and understand Knowles' philosophy as he installs it at Tennessee. The Vols are still in the hunt for more pass-rushing help to fill out the ranks. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL playoffs kick off with a six-game slate as part of NFL Super Wild Card Weekend. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos secured first-round byes as the top seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively, and 12 other teams will be fighting to advance to the Divisional Round next week. Many teams were able to rest starters in Week 18 to get healthy for the playoffs, but there are still some notable injuries that bettors should keep in mind for these six wild card games. Here, we break down those injuries as well as the latest NFL betting lines from DraftKings Sportsbook. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.Packers at Bears (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)GB QB Jordan Love (concussion, will play)GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, active)GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, out)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, will play)\nThe Packers get Jordan Love back after he was banged up to close out the year, and his backup, Malik Willis, was questionable to suit up behind him, though he's active Saturday. Additionally, receiver Dontayvion Wicks is out for Green Bay after a 332-yard season. As for Chicago, the Bears will get receiver Rome Odunze back after a foot injury cost him considerable time late in the season. Odunze missed the final five games of 2025 after tallying 661 yards and six touchdowns over 12 games. Green Bay is a slight 1.5-point favorite on the road here, and the total is 44.5.Bills at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET, Sunday)BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, will play)BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, questionable)\nThis matchup sees the No. 1 rushing offense in the Bills face off with the Jaguars' No. 1-ranked run defense. That will be a key matchup to watch, and Buffalo receiving back Ty Johnson is questionable. He had 263 receiving yards and five total touchdowns as the backup to NFL rushing leader James Cook. The good news for the Bills is Josh Allen's favorite target is back, as tight end Dalton Kincaid is off the injury report after missing considerable time with a nagging knee injury.Buffalo is a 1.5-point road favorite. And at 51.5, this total is the highest of the entire six-game Wild Card Weekend slate.49ers at Eagles (4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, questionable)PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, questionable)\nAfter missing nearly half of the season, star Philadelphia right tackle Lane Johnson appears to be on track to return to the lineup on Sunday as he practiced this week and is listed as questionable. The 49ers are also hoping to get their star tackle back as left tackle Trent Williams is questionable after missing Week 18. Second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is also questionable. He's missed eight games in 2025.The Eagles are -6 on the spread and the total is 44.5.Chargers at Patriots (8 p.m. ET, Sunday)LAC RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, questionable)NE WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring, questionable)\nThe Chargers have been utterly decimated by injuries on offense this year, particularly at running back and offensive line. Star rookie back Omarion Hampton missed eight games this year but still compiled 737 scrimmage yards and five touchdowns in nine games. He's questionable for this contest with an ankle injury, though he told reporters he expects to play on Sunday. As for the Patriots, explosive receiver Kayshon Boutte is questionable. He cooled off after a three-week stretch with four touchdowns, but Boutte can take the tops off of defenses for Drake Maye. New England is favored by 3.5 points. The total is 45.5.Texans at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)PITT RB Jaylen Warren (illness, TBD)\nThe final injury report for this Monday showdown doesn't come out until Saturday, but one big name who missed practice this week is Steelers starting running back Jaylen Warren. Warren is dealing with an illness, per the report, which is likely a better sign than a different injury. Warren had 958 rushing yards in his first full season as the Steelers' lead running back. Houston is favored by 3-points. The total is 38.5 -- the lowest of the first round.\n            ",

    "body": "\nHere's a stat for you: The 2025 New England Patriots had the easiest schedule since the 1999 St. Louis Rams. But the Patriots don't care if you think that their turnaround season and 14-3 record were the byproduct of playing nobodies; those Rams parlayed that schedule into a Super Bowl title, and New England plans to do the same.On Sunday, the Patriots will get a chance to quiet their critics when the team squares off against the Los Angeles Chargers (11-6) in a NFL Super Wild Card Weekend matchup on Sunday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The winner will advance to an AFC Divisional Round game next week.Both New England and Los Angeles are seeking their first playoff win since the 2018 season. In addition both quarterbacks -- the Patriots' Drake Maye and the Chargers' Justin Herbert -- are looking to earn their first career playoff victories. Maye is making his postseason debut, while Herbert is 0-for-2 in his playoff appearances.New England is a 3.5-point favorite over Los Angeles at DraftKings.Patriots vs. Chargers odds\nOpening spread: Patriots -3.5 (-110)Opening money line: Patriots -180, Chargers +150Opening total: 44.5This line has remained steady at this number since opening at New England -3.5. This will be the fifth time in the last six games with Los Angeles as the underdog. The Chargers went 3-1 both against-the-spread and straight-up in those previous four contests. Meanwhile the Patriots are 4-1 both ATS and straight-up over their last five games. The last time these teams met came in Week 17 of the 2024 season, also in Foxborough. Los Angeles was a six-point favorite that day and won 40-7.However, there has been some movement on the total, which has risen slightly from its initial offering. Over bettors may be taking into account that New England has scored at least 24 points in 12 straight games.Patriots betting profile\nOpening win total: 7.5 wins  W/L record: 14-3ATS record: 12-5O/U record: 11-6Believers in the Patriots had many positive moments in 2025. New England's 12-5 record against-the-spread during the regular season was tied for the best such record in the league. The Patriots also soared over their preseason win total, earning their eighth win in Week 10. In addition, the Over has hit in each of New England's last five games.On Sunday, the Patriots will face a Los Angeles offense that has struggled to protect Herbert. Playing without their starting offensive tackles for much of the year, the Chargers allowed a franchise-worst 60 sacks this season, which is the fifth-most by any team that's ever reached the playoffs. In addition, Herbert has famously struggled in the postseason. He is 0-2 in his playoff career, including a 32-12 loss last year to the Texans in which he competed just 14-of-32 passes for 242 yards and four interceptions with only one touchdown pass.Chargers betting profile\nOpening win total: 9.5 winsW/L record: 11-6ATS record: 9-8O/U record: 7-10The Chargers are 4-2 both ATS and straight-up in their last six games, but remember that coach Jim Harbaugh sat several key starters in the regular season finale against the Broncos. Los Angeles is 4-0 straight-up all-time as an underdog in the Wild Card round, but the last one of those victories came in the 2018 season. The Under has cashed in four of team's last five games, and Under bettors will like that the total has crept up since its opening. While the Chargers have been notorious for giving up sacks this season, New England hasn't been a high-sack defense. The Patriots have registered just 35 sacks this season; just six teams have had fewer. In addition, New England is largely unproven against quality teams. The Patriots are just 1-2 this season against teams that finished with a winning record. That lone victory came in Week 5 against the Bills.Patriots-Chargers prop pick: Hunter Henry Over 41.5 total receiving yards\nLos Angeles' defense has few weaknesses, but one area that Maye and the Patriots may be able to exploit is the Chargers' woes when covering tight ends. Los Angeles allows a passer rating of 111.6 when quarterbacks throw to tight ends. That ranks 24th in the entire NFL and bodes well for New England tight end Hunter Henry. The 6-foot-5, 249-pound threat has gone Over 41.5 receiving yards in nine of 17 games this season, including five of the last seven games. He leads the team in receiving touchdowns (seven) and ranks second behind only Stefon Diggs in targets (87), receptions (60) and receiving yards (768). He could have a big day if Maye emphasizes short and intermediate routes in his postseason debut.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        And then there were two. The 2026 college football season has led to this: No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami will meet in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game to decide the best team in the country. In most years, the Hurricanes would be seen as an overwhelming favorite against Indiana. But Miami has gone on an underdog run of its own after making the playoff as the last at-large team. Indiana, meanwhile, has bowled over opposing teams en route to a 15-0 record. The Hoosiers are 2025's hegemon and it appears as if they aren't going away anytime soon. They handled their semifinal game against Oregon with ease, downing the Ducks 56-22. Miami, meanwhile, triumphed over Ole Miss in a 31-27 thriller that ranks as one of the best postseason games of the CFP era. \nThose semifinal games, of course, provided plenty of material to overreact to as the 2025 season nears its conclusion. Indiana is the best team of the CFP era Yes, better than 2019 LSU. The Hoosiers may not have as much elite NFL talent -- though quarterback Fernando Mendoza is a shoe-in to go first overall in the 2026 draft -- and the offense isn't quite as explosive, but they are a more complete team. Indiana's +473 point differential ranks first among schools in the playoff era (hat tip to my CBS Sports colleague Tom Fornelli). The Hoosiers have bludgeoned opposing teams by an average of 31.5 points per contest. Their last three wins against blue bloods Ohio State and Alabama and new blood Oregon have come by a combined score of 107-35. \nCurt Cignetti's squad has won all but one of its games against ranked opponents by at least 10 points. And Indiana is doing this in the Big Ten, one of the nation's premier conferences.  The Hoosiers are also on the precipice of becoming the first college football program to ever go 16-0. Of course, they have the benefit of playing in the expanded playoff years, but an undefeated season in the modern era of college football, when parity is at an all-time high thanks to NIL, seems like an accomplishment that won't be easily repeated. After all, only four NFL teams have ever completed undefeated seasons and it only happened once after the league went to a 16-game schedule. \n\n        \n            \n                Indiana vs. Miami: Early preview, odds, picks as Hoosiers will meet Hurricanes in CFP National Championship\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMiami's discipline issues will doom it against IndianaMiami was, somehow, able to overcome itself in the Fiesta Bowl against Ole Miss. The Hurricanes committed 10 penalties for a total of 74 yards, including a targeting foul that resulted in the ejection of cornerback Xavier Lucas. They dropped four potential interceptions. Those fouls allowed Ole Miss to hang around and even take the lead at certain points. Ultimately, the Rebels made a few crucial mistakes of their own -- and were pitiful on third down -- which allowed the Hurricanes to outlast Ole Miss. That won't do against the well-oiled Indiana machine. The Hoosiers rank third nationally with just 3.57 penalties per game. They're smart, they're disciplined and -- as was seen with D'Angelo Ponds' pick six to open Indiana's semifinal win over Oregon -- they will pounce all over any mistakes the opponent makes. \nUltimately, discipline will make the difference in a battle between two teams that stack up fairly well otherwise. Oregon is in trouble You've certainly heard of a clutch gene if you're a fan of sports. Oregon coach Dan Lanning has the opposite. In their last three playoff games against Power Four opponents, the Ducks have been outscored 97-66. That includes a 23-0 romp against Big 12 champion Texas Tech this season. \nTalent isn't the issue with Oregon. The Phil Knight money certainly helps, but the Ducks have always recruited at a high clip. Coach Dan Lanning has done a good job at the high school level and in the portal. But there's plenty of reason to be concerned about the path that Oregon is walking with Lanning, especially given the recent postseason results. This will be a big offseason for him. The Ducks are set to lose both of their bright young coordinators. Will Stein is headed to coach Kentucky while Tosh Lupoi will lead former Pac-12 foe California. \nIt is a good sign for a program's health when assistants get head coaching jobs, and it's a testament to what Lanning has built at the young age of 39. The next few months will be a huge test of his ability to keep the ship steady. Ole Miss is bigger than Lane KiffinIt was time to stop talking about Kiffin's move to LSU once the playoff began, but the two will always be intrinsically linked given the time that Kiffin had in Oxford and the messy nature in which he departed. While Kiffin deserves his flowers for elevating the standard at Ole Miss, it's clear that the Rebels have outgrown the need for him. His departure didn't do the program any favors or anything like that. Pete Golding has shown, in short order, that he can at least maintain the level of success that Kiffin established -- if not exceed it. Golding, after all, has more playoff wins than Kiffin at this point, and he's only been a head coach for three games. \nKiffin was certainly hoping that he'd be able to drag some of Ole Miss' top stars with him, but his decision instead galvanized the Rebels. Top running back Kewan Lacy, top linebacker Suntarine Perkins and edge rusher Princewill Umanmielen, along with a bevy of other key players, have already committed to returning. On top of that, Ole Miss is off to an incredible start in the transfer portal. The Rebels currently sit seventh in 247Sports' Team Transfer Rankings. They're one of just two schools in the top 10 with less than 10 commits thus far and their average prospect grade of 89.22 is first among top-15 transfer classes. Four of Ole Miss' nine transfer additions hold at least a four-star ranking. That includes LSU transfer Carius Curne, the No. 1 offensive tackle in the transfer portal, who spurned Kiffin for the Rebels. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL's head coach hiring cycle was turned on its head last week when the Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh.While the hourglass on his time in Baltimore ran out, Harbaugh instantly became the top candidate on the market for the remaining seven teams looking to fill a head coaching vacancy. His availability has prompted teams to reach out in earnest to set up meetings to pitch the veteran head coach on joining their franchise. Harbaugh has yet to interview for any openings officially, but that will change in a week's time.Harbaugh told Fox Sports that while plenty of teams have reached out, he's going to narrow his search to roughly three or four teams and then go through the interview process with those franchises. As Harbaugh scouts for his next destination in the NFL, let's do the same. Below, we'll rank the three best fits for the head coach.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Tennessee TitansAccording to The Athletic, Harbaugh is spending the next few days watching film on a couple of young quarterbacks, including Cam Ward. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft flashed down the stretch of his rookie year, albeit during a forgettable 3-14 campaign for Tennessee. If Harbaugh believes Ward can become a true franchise centerpiece, the Titans are an attractive destination because they are effectively a blank slate outside of quarterback.Yes, the roster needs to be rebuilt, but the organization has the ammunition to jump-start a turnaround. The Titans are armed with a projected $113 million in cap space, the most in the NFL at the moment. On top of that, they have the fourth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and the presence of Ward allows them to take one of the best non-QB prospects in the class. When you pair those assets with Ward, it's a strong starting point for Harbaugh.\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these eight jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Atlanta FalconsA Matt Ryan-John Harbaugh-led Falcons franchise feels like an awfully powerful duo. The franchise has already hired its former MVP quarterback as its first-ever president of football, and now it needs to find a head coach to replace Raheem Morris. If Atlanta were to lure Harbaugh, it would instantly possess one of the top brain trusts in the league, which is something Harbaugh likely recognizes as well.\nFrom a football perspective, the Falcons are a strong candidate on a couple of different fronts. They have loads of star power on the roster. Offensively, Bijan Robinson is one of the best running backs in the NFL, while wideout Drake London is an up-and-coming star at the position in his own right. On defense, the unit features All-Pro cornerback A.J. Terrell and some fascinating first-year players, such as pass rusher James Pearce Jr. and safety Xavier Watts. On top of that, the Falcons play in a very winnable division in the NFC South.The major sticking point with this possible pairing is the quarterback position, specifically Harbaugh's view of Michael Penix Jr. The former first-round pick is coming off a season-ending ACL tear and has been up and down over the course of his young career. If Harbaugh thinks he can win with Penix, then the Falcons check a ton of boxes.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New York GiantsThere's a really good argument to be made for the Giants as the top job for Harbaugh. We noted that Cam Ward was one of the quarterbacks Harbaugh is reportedly watching tape on -- well, so is Jaxson Dart. \nNew York is a destination that has a young quarterback in place, and Dart flashed a tremendously high ceiling during his rookie campaign. That said, he'll need to be reined in with some of his scrambling, which Harbaugh should view as an easy fix. Once Dart gets that honed in, he'll be quite the dual-threat quarterback, which Harbaugh knows something about after coaching Lamar Jackson to two NFL MVP awards.But the Giants are not just a good fit because of Dart. The roster has potential, with wideout Malik Nabers and running back Cam Skattebo headlining a young skill-position group, along with a defensive line that features Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence and Abdul Carter. New York also has the fifth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, so there is another avenue to bring in an instant-impact player. This is the type of group that can turn around in a hurry with the right coach, like Harbaugh.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Scoot over Kevin Stefanski and Klint Kubiak, there's a new most sought-after coach in the 2026 NFL coaching carousel: John Harbaugh. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 seasons (2008-2025) on Tuesday two days after losing the de facto AFC North championship game to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a missed field goal as time expired.Harbaugh's Ravens went 180-113 in his 18 seasons, good for the fourth-best in the NFL in that span behind only the New England Patriots (193-100), the Pittsburgh Steelers (183-108-2) and the Green Bay Packers (182-108-3). His 13 playoff wins are tied for the seventh-most in NFL history along with Mike Holmgren. Harbaugh's eight road playoff wins are the most in NFL postseason history. He helped lead Baltimore to the second Super Bowl title in franchise history with a victory in Super Bowl XLVII over the San Francisco 49ers to conclude the 2012 season. Harbaugh earned NFL Coach of the Year honors in 2019 when the Ravens produced a 14-2 record in quarterback Lamar Jackson's first of two NFL MVP campaigns. Blowing a 10-0 lead against the Steelers on Sunday night ended up being the final straw for Harbaugh, whose 26 blown leads of 10-plus points are the most by any coach since 2008 when he took over the Ravens' job. Twelve of them occurred over the last five seasons, which is five more than any other team in the NFL. After his 180 wins with the Ravens, the eighth-most by any coach with one team in NFL history, Harbaugh will now be arguably the most coveted coach of this NFL hiring cycle. Here's a look at his top five landing spots now that he is available.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these eight jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns If Harbaugh desired to go the petty route, he could remain in the AFC North with the Cleveland Browns after they fired Kevin Stefanski. Cleveland needs a breath of fresh air after the doom and gloom trading for and extending quarterback Deshaun Watson brought their franchise. Harbaugh oversaw the drafting and development of quarterback Joe Flacco, who won Super Bowl XLVII honors, and Jackson, who won NFL MVP honors in 2019 and 2023. Coaching soon-to-be two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year edge rusher Myles Garrett after he just broke the league's single-season record with 23.0 in 2025 could be very appealing. He'll just need to help Cleveland navigate a successful search for a franchise quarterback after hitting on two with the Ravens in Flacco and Jackson. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons are perhaps the most win-now option of the current NFL coaching vacancies given their young talent and being in the NFC South, a division the Carolina Panthers won with a losing record (8-9) in 2025.\nRunning back Bijan Robinson, at 23 years old, led the NFL in scrimmage yards (2,298). Wide receiver Drake London, 24, has flashed No. 1 wide receiver potential at times. Tight end Kyle Pitts, 25, is showing progress after producing a career-high 88 catches, the second-most in the NFL among tight ends in 2025. Defensively, the Falcons had the 2025 rookie leader in sacks and quarterback pressures (edge rusher James Pearce Jr. with 10.5 sacks and 45 quarterback pressures), the No. 2 2025 rookie leader in sacks (edge rusher Jalon Walker) and the 2025 rookie leader in interceptions (safety Xavier Watts with five). That's a strong foundation for a team whose division is up for grabs every season. If Harbaugh can help the Falcons get the quarterback position right, Atlanta could be a contender for years to come.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants The New York Giants have their hopeful quarterback of the future in place with 2025 first-round pick Jaxson Dart. He ended his rookie year on a high note with 230 yards passing and two passing touchdowns while completing 22 of his 32 throws for a career-high 110.2 passer rating in a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Pro Bowl wide receiver Malik Nabers will be back for Year 3 fully recovered from a torn ACL. \nPro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL in sacks with 16.5, and the Giants also have Pro Bowl defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence in the middle with 2025 third overall pick edge rusher Abdul Carter developing on the other side of the defensive line as well. If Harbaugh wants to coach what is arguably the most talented defensive line in football with some offensive playmakers already in place, the Giants make plenty of sense. It will be interesting to see if he would want to work with general manager Joe Schoen or if he would prefer entering a new team with a general manager he already possesses an established rapport with. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders The Raiders are a blank slate Harbaugh can mold in his own image since they have the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick. He can handpick his preferred quarterback between Oregon's Dante Moore and Indiana Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. \nHe would be pairing one of those passers with 2024 sixth overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty. Jeanty is the first rookie in NFL history with 900-plus rushing yards (975), five-plus rushing touchdowns (4) and five-plus receiving touchdowns (5). Plus, 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, who will be in just his third season in 2026. Five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Maxx Crosby is also a fantastic defensive foundation block. However, the AFC West is a gauntlet with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos, the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers and Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsTeam owner Stephen Ross is a huge fan of the Harbaugh family as a prominent University of Michigan alum: the university's business school is named after the Dolphins owner. That could lead to Ross moving heaven and earth to land Harbaugh.Miami will be headed toward a rebuild in 2026 and 2027 with the failed nature of the Tua Tagovailoa era that netted zero playoff wins, which could put the Dolphins in prime position to draft University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning in 2027. That setup, plus the opportunity to live in South Florida as Harbaugh enters his mid-60s, could be quite appealing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers versus the Chicago Bears, the NFL's oldest/most-played rivalry with 213 games on the books including their upcoming playoff matchup, will be reignited for a third time in the 2025 season. Each team won at home in the regular season with both games ending in a one-score win. Bears quarterback Caleb Williams threw an interception to Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon with 27 seconds to play to seal a 28-21 Packers home win in Week 14 while Williams threw a 46-yard, game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver DJ Moore in a 22-16 overtime win in Week 16.   The last time these two teams played in Week 16, Packers quarterback Jordan Love got knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter, but he'll be back for this matchup after sitting out the final two games of the regular season. Love is a perfect 4-0 against the Bears in the four matchups with Chicago that he has started and finished in his three seasons as Green Bay's starting quarterback. The loss in Week 16 in 2025 and the loss in Week 18 in 2024 involved backup quarterback Malik Willis finishing the game because of an injury to Love. Green Bay is making its third playoff appearance in three seasons with Love as the team's starting quarterback while Chicago is making its first playoff appearance since 2020 and first of Williams' career under the guidance of first-year head coach Ben Johnson. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's almost time for the Packers vs. Bears grudge match at Soldier Field in the postseason after two thrilling, one-possession wins for each team this regular season. Here are the key things to know plus a game prediction for the first Green Bay vs. Chicago playoff game since the 2010 NFC Championship game, a game that was won 21-14 at Soldier Field by the visiting Packers en route to a Super Bowl XLV title. \nWhere to watch Bears vs. Packers liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 10 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Soldier Field (Chicago, Illinois)Stream: Amazon Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -1.5, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nPackers vs. Bears: Need to know\nHow crisp will Jordan Love, Josh Jacobs and Zack Tom be for Packers' offense? Love, running back Josh Jacobs and right tackle Zack Tom are all varying degrees of banged up. Love (concussion) should be good to go after not playing contact football for three weeks by the time this playoff matchup kicks off on Saturday night. Running back Josh Jacobs has been dealing with a knee issue since tweaking it on the MetLife Stadium turf back in Week 11. He had just four carries for three yards in Week 17 against the Baltimore Ravens before sitting out the Week 18 season finale at the Minnesota Vikings. Right tackle Zack Tom suffered a knee injury in Week 15 at the Denver Broncos, and he hasn't played since. Tom practiced as a limited participant every day this week while both Love and Jacobs are no longer on the team's injury report. That's an encouraging sign for Green Bay.Can the Bears' No. 3 rush offense take advantage of depleted Packers defensive line? \nOne of a number of things Ben Johnson was able to take with him from the Detroit Lions to the Chicago Bears in 2025 was a successful run game. Chicago is averaging 144.5 rushing yards per game this season, the third-most in the NFL this season. Green Bay is without both All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons (ACL) and stout defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt (ankle). Since Week 16, with both sidelined, the Packers are allowing an NFL-worst 198.0 rushing yards per game. Yes, that average is inflated by Derrick Henry's all-time performance (216 yards and four touchdowns on 36 carries) against them in Week 17, but the Packers did allow the Bears to rush for 150 against them in the Week 16 defeat at Soldier Field. This would appear to be an advantage for Chicago.Who is going to force the game-tilting turnover on defense? Packers safety Xavier McKinney totaled eight interceptions in 2024, the second-most in the league. Bears safety Kevin Byard led the NFL with eight interceptions in 2025. Which one of them will take away a football that flutters an extra second longer in the area out of the hand of Love or Williams after perhaps being hit on a throw? \nAs long as both quarterbacks remain healthy, this game has the makings of a high-scoring affair like the 28-21 Packers victory in Week 14. Whichever team can force that one crucial takeaway could take control of the game. Packers vs. Bears prediction\nWith Love healthy once again, he'll have a similar performance like he did in the first matchup between these teams when he threw three touchdowns, including a couple explosives to No. 1 receiver Christian Watson. Williams will play well like he did at the San Francisco 49ers on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 17, but like that night in Santa Clara, he'll come up just short in his first NFL playoff game. Pick: Packers 31, Bears 27 | (Packers -1.5, Over 44.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The end of the regular season doesn't just close the book on another year in the NFL. For some franchises, it also coincides with a reevaluation of the entire organization, which can result in various firings. While some clubs made changes midseason, the more common time we see head coaches and GMs be let go comes the day after the regular season concludes, better known as Black Monday. Already, we've seen six teams fire their now-former head coach (Falcons, Browns, Cardinals, Raiders, Ravens, and Dolphins) and one club also rid itself of its general manager (Falcons) -- the Dolphins fired their GM midseason. Pair that with the two head coaching vacancies (Giants and Titans) that were already open due to firings during the season, and you have 25% of the league looking for a new head coach. So, who fills them? With the Band-Aid ripped off, those teams are now beginning the process of finding their next leader. Below, we'll chronicle that pursuit by tracking the latest interview requests by each team. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Head coaches\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsPrevious head coach: Jonathan GannonAfter three seasons on the job, the Cardinals decided to move on from Jonathan Gannon. He went 15-36 as the organization's head coach, which included a 3-14 season in 2025. Arizona ended the year on a nine-game losing streak. The Cardinals have made the playoffs once in the last 10 seasons. \nInterview requestsVance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (ESPN)Robert Saleh -- 49ers defensive coordinator (NBC)Antony Weaver -- Dolphins defensive coordinator (ESPN)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (Sports Illustrated)Thomas Brown -- Patriots passing game coordinator (NFL Media)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Raheem Morris -- former Falcons head coach (ESPN)Jeff Hafley -- Packers defensive coordinator (ESPN)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsPrevious head coach: Raheem MorrisAfter two seasons on the job, the Falcons fired Morris in the aftermath of a disappointing 2025 campaign.

Harbaugh was the NFL's second-longest tenured head coach after Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh, who knocked him out of the playoffs with a Week 18 victory that may have clinched his departure. While this is the end of an era in Baltimore, the Ravens suddenly become the top available job in the NFL simply due to the presence of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. Completed interviewsVance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (team announced)David Webb -- Broncos quarterbacks coach (team announced)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (team announced)Interview requestsAnthony Weaver -- Dolphins defensive coordinator (The Athletic)Klint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Brian Flores -- Vikings defensive coordinator (NFL Media)Matt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Kliff Kingsbury -- former Commanders offensive coordinator (NFL Media)Robert Saleh -- 49ers defensive coordinator (ESPN)Joe Brady -- Bills offensive coordinator (NFL Media)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsPrevious head coach: Kevin StefanskiCleveland moved on from Kevin Stefanski after a 5-12 season in 2025 that saw the franchise finish last in the AFC North.

The Raiders finished with the worst record in the NFL (3-14) and now possess the No. 1 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft.

Initially, it looked as if McDaniel had saved his job, but Stephen Ross, after a meeting this week to discuss the season, decided to cut bait and go through a total reset. It's slated to be transformative offseason in Miami, as it now needs a new head coach and general manager and is likely to move on from Tua Tagovailoa. Interview requestsKlint Kubiak -- Seahawks offensive coordinator (team announcement)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsPrevious head coach: Brian DabollNew York fired Daboll midway through the 2025 season after a 2-8 start to the year.

He had been with the organization in this GM role since 2021 and was able to add some intriguing skill position players like Bijan Robinson and Drake London, but was unable to get a concrete plan in place at quarterback. A clear plan at that position will likely be the main emphasis for owner Arthur Blank as he combs through candidates this time around. Interview requestsIan Cunningham -- Bears assistant general manager (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones)Josh Williams -- 49ers director of scouting and football operations (CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones) (for President of Football role)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsPrevious GM: Chris GrierIt was a rather seismic decision by the Dolphins and Grier to mutually part ways during the 2025 season, simply due to how long his tenure had been with the organization. He started as a scout in 2000 and stayed with the franchise ever since, ascending to GM in 2016. Miami made the playoffs just three times over his 10-year stint as GM, and has been under .500 in each of the last two seasons, due to an inability to build a stable roster. \nHIRED: Jon-Eric Sullivan -- Packers VP of player personnel.

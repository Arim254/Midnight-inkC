    "body": "\n        In a strange twist of fate, those whose headline-making departures from the PGA Tour legitimized LIV Golf four years ago find themselves in a unique position to end it for good. When the PGA Tour announced on Monday that it had created a new pathway for Brooks Koepka to return to the PGA Tour, it accomplished more than welcoming back one of the game's brightest stars.Koepka left LIV Golf a few days before Christmas, citing that he wanted to spend more time with his family in 2026. The split was mutual, according to a league statement that primarily boasted Talor Gooch's impending captaincy of Smash GC, the LIV Golf team Koepka previously led.The PGA Tour responded to Koepka's decision by releasing a statement within minutes of his departure, calling the player a \"highly accomplished professional\" while stating the tour \"continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness.\"Internal conversations were held. PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp met with Koepka on multiple occasions. Meetings took place. A new pathway was concocted out of thin air. Majority approval was achieved, and on Monday, membership was made aware of the reinstatement decision. All of this transpired in a three-week window during the holidays leading into the start of the 2026 season.\nIn doing so, the PGA Tour not only opened an expedited pathway for Koepka to return without serving a year-long suspension, it created an opportunity to deal a massive blow to its rival, one from which it may not be able to recover.Koepka's journey back to the PGA Tour may well serve as a returned knife in the back of LIV Golf -- considering the league previously poached the big-swinging Floridian -- but it's not a death blow. That opportunity belongs to three other players who are now suddenly eligible to come back through the PGA Tour's Returning Membership Program: Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith.Whether any or all choose to take the PGA Tour up on its offer is anyone's best guess, of course.\nRahm's lucrative contract started towards the end of 2023, and it could be a bear to extricate himself from it, even if he wished, which some have suggested he does.DeChambeau is up for negotiations and could become the richest golfer to ever walk on this planet if he plays his cards right. Phil Mickelson once described working with LIV Golf as a once-in-a-lifetime leverage opportunity. That word, \"leverage?\" DeChambeau has in spades.Smith seems intent on remaining where he plays alongside his fellow Australians with a laidback schedule, but a PGA Tour return cannot be ruled out, either, particularly if some other top-level players depart ahead of him.\nWithout those three, what would be left of LIV Golf?A bunch of (mostly) has-beens traveling the world, participating in a rowdy tournament in Australia that is considered the event of year yet comes across as more of a concert than golf event? Players like Joaquin Niemann, Patrick Reed and Tyrell Hatton stranded in what can only be described as no man's land? Oh, the teams. How could we forget about The Crushers? They may be EBITDA positive, but would they be without DeChambeau?These were not questions being asked three weeks ago as LIV Golf and its backers, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, long ago decided they would spend whatever money was necessary to keep the league afloat. But with DeChambeau, Rahm and Smith now having a deadline of Feb. 2 -- two days before LIV Golf kicks off its season -- to decide on their future, sport-defining change could come swiftly.After four years of an intersport battle that has split golf -- involving defections, pointless meetings, grand proclamations, flash mobs, weird messages to set up even weirder announcements and a lot of grandstanding with little to show for it -- it could all come down to these next three weeks.\nThe ball is officially in the court of DeChambeau, Rahm and Smith, and it's the PGA Tour who handed it to them.\n            ",

    "body": "\nManchester City are always graded on a curve, one uniquely of their own creation. It is hard to shed the weight of expectations from a Pep Guardiola team, especially when the heyday of four successive Premier League titles and a victory in the UEFA Champions League is not all that distant a memory. It means the current iteration of City almost pale in comparison to Guardiola's best, as harsh as it sounds – and yet, they just might be good enough to actually win some silverware this season.Multiple things are true at once for City these days. They are obviously second-best to Premier League leaders Arsenal, a six point gap through 21 games as clear a sign of that as any. That does not actually mean City are inherently incapable of winning a trophy this season, though, and that things are not trending in the right direction for Guardiola and company.Last season's trophyless showing was the perfect place for a rebuild, which City technically soft-launched last January when they spent more than $200 million on transfers in the hopes of revamping their squad. A year and two transfer windows later, City undoubtedly have a new look but one that is a blend of their existing strengths. The attack revolves around Erling Haaland, who has scored 20 of City's 45 Premier League goals this season, but his supporting cast looks a little different these days. Rayan Cherki has been one of the best new auditions to the Premier League this season with six goals and 10 assists across all competitions, while Tijjani Reijnders has six of each so far. Those newcomers alone have added new dimensions to a City team that has always been attack-minded and, at the very least, make them a luxury version of a team that should focus their trophy-winning efforts on cup competitions this season.They face Newcastle United on Tuesday in the first of two legs of the EFL Cup semifinals, the competition perhaps as good a chance as any to reverse course after last season's trophyless campaign. The Magpies will act as a dramatic foil of sorts in that their great emphasis is on defensive organization, though they have underperformed in that category so far this season. Newcastle have the Premier League's second-best expected goals against tally at 23.69 but have conceded 27 times, eight other teams faring better in league play so far. City technically are not entering this match in exhilarating form, either – before a lopsided 10-1 win in the FA Cup over League One side Exeter City, they notched three successive draws and watched the gap atop the Premier League table slip from two points to six. There is an argument to be made that they were unlucky, beating their expected goals average of 1.9 per game in two of those matches, even if they did not have the goals to back it up.The onus on Tuesday might just be on City to start the semifinals on a high, especially as Guardiola tries to build a more well-rounded attacking unit. The latest addition to the group is Antoine Semenyo, who joined the club last week after scoring 10 goals for Bournemouth this season and bagged his first City goal on Saturday against Exeter. He will be eligible to play for Guardiola's side on Tuesday – a player is allowed to represent two clubs a season in the EFL Cup – but the coach now has several options at his disposal in attack, including a finally in-form Phil Foden.Tuesday's match -- and as a result, the chance to win the EFL Cup -- offers a first meaningful chance for Guardiola to prove his rebuild is not just working, but will eventually allow City to find a new version of their past glory. Even if the current group has yet to reach the heights of their predecessors, though, Guardiola's new vision is clicking enough to ensure they are realistic contenders for the trophies they are still eligible to win – and that their underdog status may not be permanent.How to watch Newcastle United vs. Manchester City, oddsDate: Tuesday, Jan. 13 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: St James' Park -- Newcastle, EnglandLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Newcastle United +205; Draw +250; Manchester City +110Predicted lineupsNewcastle United: Nick Pope, Lewis Miley, Malick Thiaw, Fabian Schar, Lewis Hall, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Joelinton, Harvey Barnes, Nick Woltemade, Anthony GordonManchester City: Gianluigi Donnarumma, Matheus Nunes, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, Nico O'Reilly, Bernardo Silva, Rodri, Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Erling Haaland\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Boston Celtics fell two possessions short in one of their biggest games of the season thus far: a 100-95 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. Notable in the defeat was a free-throw discrepancy in which the Spurs made 10 more foul shots (14) than the Celtics even attempted (four). Celtics star Jaylen Brown took exception to the distribution of whistles in the loss and after the game unleashed a minute-and-a-half-long diatribe against the officials.The NBA responded Monday with a $35,000 fine for public criticism of the officiating. The league cited Brown's postgame remarks to reporters as well as a social media post in which he said he is \"sick of this s---.\"Brown, who scored 27 points but did not go to the charity stripe once, called out official Curtis Blair by name and lamented the \"inconsistency\" in the amount of contact allowed on the two ends of the floor.\"I'll accept the fine at this point,\" Brown said. \"I thought it was some bulls---- tonight. I think they're a good defensive team, but they ain't that damn good. I hope somebody could just pull up the clips, because it's the same s--- every time we play a good team. It's like, they refuse to make a call, and they call touch-fouls on the other end. That's just extremely frustrating, bro.\"The foul totals were not dramatically out of balance, as Boston was whistled 18 times to San Antonio's 13. But the majority of the Celtics' infractions sent the Spurs to the line, and their 20 free-throw attempts were a factor in the game's outcome. Brown himself was guilty of four fouls, which tied a game-high.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: The Mavericks should've folded their Anthony Davis hand a long time ago\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We play hard,\" Brown said. \"We are outplaying our expectations. We compete hard on the defensive end. They reward the other team with touch-fouls, and we go down there and guys are allowed to get away with it. Somebody, please, pull it up. Every time we play a good team the inconsistency is crazy. I'll take the f----ing fine. Curtis (Blair), all them dudes, was terrible tonight. I don't care; they can fine me whatever they want. It's crazy. Every time we play a good team, it's the same bulls---. Somebody, please, pull up the clips.\"The loss knocked the Celtics fell to 24-14 with the loss. But even with the defeat, Boston is in a much better position than the vast majority of prognosticators foresaw before the season. Despite the absence of the injured Jayson Tatum and the flurry of offseason moves that sent key contributors out of town, the Celtics are squarely in the race for the East's top seed.\"I'm irate at how they officiated the game today,\" Brown said. \"If we can't get to the free throw line, and teams are allowed to be physical and bump us off our spots, then it's hard to win games like that. We shot four free throws tonight and lost the game by four. Not to say that's the whole game, the whole story. We gotta be better in spots. But goddamn, like, I'm driving to the basket, I'm physical, I don't flop, I don't shy away from contact, I go up strong, I'm athletic, and nothing. I had zero free throws tonight. The inconsistency is f---ing crazy.\"\nBrown is in the midst of a career year and is on pace to set a personal best in scoring with his 29.5 points per game. His usage has skyrocketed with Tatum on the shelf, and he leads the NBA with 16.1 2-point attempts per contest.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A long-rumored welterweight title bout between WBC titleholder Mario Barrios and superstar Ryan Garcia became official on Monday for Feb. 21 in Las Vegas. The fight card, titled \"The Ring: High Stakes,\" will take place inside T-Mobile Arena and be streamed live exclusively on DAZN, chairman of the general entertainment authority for Saudi Arabia, Turki Alalshikh, announced in a press release.  Garcia (27-1, 19 KOs), the flamboyant and often controversial social media star, is a former WBC interim lightweight titleholder. A native of Victorville, California, the 27-year-old Garcia enters the title shot despite being fresh off a lifeless decision loss to WBA welterweight titleholder Rolando Romero last May in Times Square in New York. In his previous bout, in April 2024, Garcia missed weight ahead of a decision win over then junior welterweight titleholder Devin Haney before failing a drug test for the banned substance ostarine that turned the bout into a no contest. Garcia, who was sued by Haney, served a one-year drug suspension.\"I will be world champion on Feb. 21,\" Garcia said. \nBarrios (29-2-2, 18 KOs), who first captured the interim WBC welterweight title in his biggest win to date in 2023 against Yordenis Ugas, dropped the former champion twice in a decision win. But after being elevated to full champion when Terence Crawford vacated his undisputed crown, Barrios fought to back-to-back draws against journeyman Abel Ramos in 2024 and 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last July. A native of San Antonio, the 30-year-old Barrios recently parted ways for a second time with trainer Bob Santos in favor of Hall of Famer Joe Goossen, who previously trained Garcia for four fights, including his 2013 knockout loss to Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis.  \"Becoming WBC welterweight world champion was more than a moment -- it was a promise to my family, my city, and everyone who believed in the grind when no one was watching,\" Barrios said. \"San Antonio built me, and every sacrifice I've made comes with me into that ring. This is my division, my time, and I'm ready to show the world why the WBC title stays right here.\"\nBarrios is a former junior WBA welterweight titleholder who lost his title in a 2021 stoppage loss to Davis.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas' perfect start to the season came to an end Sunday with a narrow loss to LSU in Baton Rouge, which prompted a postgame rant from Longhorns coach Vic Schaefer in which he complained about playing LSU and South Carolina back-to-back on the road and claimed the SEC has a \"vendetta\" against his program. The Longhorns' loss leaves three remaining undefeated teams: No. 1 UConn, No. 5 Vanderbilt and No. 17 Texas Tech. While the Huskies have previously recorded six perfect seasons -- an all-time record -- the Commodores and Lady Raiders are both off to the best starts in program history. There's little debate that UConn has the best chance to be the last remaining undefeated team this season, especially given the state of the Big East. Thus, a more interesting question is trying to figure out the first loss for these three teams. Here is when our experts expect each of these teams to lose their first game of the season. No. 1 UConn (18-0)Jack Maloney: NeverThe Huskies have led by at least 20 points in every single game this season and boast a plus-52.5 net rating. They have the best defense in the country (71.3 defensive rating), the best player in the country (Sarah Strong) and the best coach in the country (Geno Auriemma). No one on their remaining regular season schedule can challenge them, and they are rightfully the heavy favorite to win it all. \nIsabel Gonzalez: NeverI said during preseason that I think UConn will go undefeated and I still believe that. UConn's toughest opponents remaining in the regular season are Notre Dame and Tennessee, but the Huskies get to play both of those games in Connecticut.Erica Ayala: NeverTennessee and Notre Dame are the only remaining ranked opponents for the Huskies before the Big East conference tournament where i expect Connecticut to come out on top again. Neither Tennessee nor Notre Dame have been consistent teams and UConn should be able to handle both in the coming weeks. Lindsay Gibbs: NeverUnlike many of my colleagues, I did not expect the Huskies to go undefeated this season, but they made it through the nonconference schedule unscathed and are just so much better than every other Big East team that I just simply don't see them losing before the NCAA tournament. I think the biggest threat is against Notre Dame on Jan. 19 -- the Fighting Irish have been maddeningly inconsistent this season, but Hannah Hidalgo has the type of talent that can take over and rattle even the most elite opponents. But it won't be enough.\nNo. 5 Vanderbilt (17-0)Maloney: Jan. 25 at South CarolinaThe Commodores have tied the best start in program history, thanks to an elite offense led by Mikayla Blakes and strong 3-point shooting, but it's unlikely they'll remain undefeated for long. Their next five contests include a neutral site game against No. 8 Michigan and road trips to No. 2 South Carolina and No. 16 Ole Miss. While they have what it takes to beat Michigan at a neutral venue, it's hard to see them knocking off South Carolina, who hasn't lost a home SEC game since 2019. Gonzalez: Jan. 19 vs. MichiganThe Wolverines' only two losses this season have been to No. 1 UConn and Washington, a team that has gone in and out of the rankings. Michigan has multiple scoring threats and could provide Vanderbilt a tough challenge on a neutral court.Ayala: Jan. 19 vs. MichiganI expect this to be a well contested, close game but ultimately I have a likely underrated and overlooked Wolverines seizing the opportunity to prove they are a formidable opponent. \nGibbs: Jan. 29 at Ole MissIn the next two weeks, Vanderbilt has two massive tests, on a neutral court against No. 8 Michigan on Jan. 19 and on the road against the South Carolina Gamecocks on Jan. 25, and I predict the Commodores are going to make waves by winning both of those games. However, they will have a hard time following up their South Carolina upset and will fall in their next game against No. 16 Ole Miss on the road.No. 17 Texas Tech (18-0)Maloney: Jan. 21 at BYUThe Lady Raiders, who are off to the best start in program history, are easily the biggest surprise among the remaining undefeated teams. With respect to what they've accomplished, they only have three wins against teams in the top-50 in NET rankings (Mississippi State, Baylor and West Virginia) and those were by a combined 13 points. Later this month, they have a road trip to Utah to take on BYU and Utah in the span of four days. It's hard to see them emerging from that journey unscathed. Gonzalez: Jan. 24 at UtahWe don't talk enough about how competitive the Big 12 is. The Utes already showed how dangerous they are when they took TCU to overtime earlier this month and handed the Horned Frogs their first loss of the season. \nAyala: Jan. 28 vs. Iowa StateI like Isabel's pick, but I think Texas Tech gets through Utah but struggles against Iowa State. The Cyclones have lost their last three games, but I expect them to reestablish their groove soon. Gibbs: Jan. 24 at UtahTexas Tech deserves a world of credit for making it this far in the season without a loss, and I actually think their surprising run of perfection will continue for another few games, until they face Utah on the road on Jan. 24. Utah is 6-0 in the Big 12 and 6-2 at home this season, and Utah's three-point shooting will get the best of the Lady Raiders at last.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are one step closer to Super Bowl LX. The NFL playoffs kicked off with a bang during a frantic Wild Card Weekend that featured several photo finishes. No matter where you looked, playoff games were coming down to the wire across the opening slate. In all, there were four comeback wins in the final three minutes of the fourth quarter -- the most ever in a single postseason.Now, there are just eight teams left standing, hoping to punch their ticket to Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX. As we embark on the divisional round this weekend, the No. 1 seeds in both conferences, the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, emerge from their first-round bye weeks and enter the fray, adding even more firepower to the playoff bracket. As we gear up for more action, let's take our first look at the divisional round matchups, along with the odds and a quick preview of each contest. AFC Buffalo Bills at Denver BroncosSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nWe don't have to look far back to find the last time these teams met in the postseason, squaring off just last year in the wild card round. Buffalo throttled the Broncos at Highmark Stadium, 31-7. Denver scored on the opening drive, then was shut out the rest of the way.\nThis matchup, however, should be different. For starters, it will be played at Mile High after Denver secured the No. 1 seed. The Broncos also boast one of the NFL's top defenses, allowing just 18.3 points per game during the regular season. They'll need that elite level of play again to keep Josh Allen -- who scored three touchdowns last week -- in check.The Bills quarterback is coming off his first career road playoff win after beating the Jaguars in Jacksonville and is looking to add to his postseason résumé, entering this matchup as a road favorite.\n        \n            \n                NFL wild card overreactions: Josh Allen is the biggest X factor of playoffs; A.J. Brown done in Philly?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHouston Texans at New England PatriotsSunday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN (Stream: Fubo -- try for free) \nThis will be the first meeting between these two teams since the 2016 divisional round, which New England won on its way to a Super Bowl title. They last met in Week 6 of last season, when Houston rolled to a 41-21 victory, but both teams look very different now.\nBoth quarterbacks are also looking to bounce back from uneven wild-card performances. Drake Maye threw two interceptions in a win over the Chargers, while C.J. Stroud is coming off a three-turnover outing against Pittsburgh. Houston still boasts one of the NFL's top defenses and showed it again Monday night against the Steelers. New England isn't usually grouped among the league's elite units, but it looked the part after sacking Justin Herbert six times on Sunday night, setting the stage for what could be a defensive showdown.NFCSan Francisco 49ers at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nWe have ourselves a rubber match between two NFC West rivals. The Seahawks and 49ers split the regular-season series, with San Francisco winning in Week 1 before Seattle returned the favor with a 13–3 victory in Week 18 to clinch the No. 1 seed and the division title. Oddly enough, both games were won by the road team, but the 49ers will have to overcome some significant injury issues to keep that trend alive here.\nSan Francisco has been hit hard by injuries all season and is coming off a playoff win over Philadelphia in which star tight end George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles tear. That leaves Brock Purdy without one of his primary weapons as he faces an elite Seattle defense. The Seahawks ranked No. 1 in scoring defense this season, allowing just 17.2 points per game, and also led the league on third down and in yards per rush allowed.That defensive dominance, along with Sam Darnold's strong play at quarterback, helped Seattle win 11 of its final 12 games to close the regular season. This is the fourth time the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 seed, and each of the previous three resulted in a trip to the Super Bowl.Los Angeles Rams (-3.5) at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC\nBoth teams pulled off late wins on Wild Card Weekend. Los Angeles avoided a road upset against the Carolina Panthers after Matthew Stafford led a seven-play, 71-yard, game-winning touchdown drive in the final two minutes of regulation.\nChicago, meanwhile, staged a miraculous second-half comeback against the Green Bay Packers, erasing an 18-point deficit. Caleb Williams and the offense erupted late, outscoring Green Bay 25–6 in the fourth quarter.The last time these teams met came during the 2024 regular season, when Chicago earned a 24–18 win. In that game, D'Andre Swift piled up 165 yards from scrimmage, while Stafford threw no touchdowns and committed two turnovers.\n            ",

Possibly aiding the Steelers in their quest to accomplish that goal is their unbelievable record at home in games played on Monday night over the past four decades. Since 1992, the Steelers won a whopping 23 straight home games on \"Monday Night Football.\" Pittsburgh's last home loss on Monday night came in a 23-20 loss to the New York Giants on October 14, 1991. Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll was on the sidelines the last time Pittsburgh lost a Monday Night Football home game. Fellow Hall of Famer Bill Cowher's teams went 11-0 at home on Monday night. His successor, Mike Tomlin, has gone 12-0 in home  \"Monday Night Football\" games. \nPittsburgh suffered a loss to the visiting Washington Commanders on a Monday game in 2020, but that game wasn't on prime time as it was part of the NFL's COVID rescheduling.LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Texans in a playoff edition of \"Monday Night Football.\" Steelers 'Monday Night Football' home results since 1992DateOpponentResultOct. 19, 1992Cincinnati BengalsW, 20-0Nov. 15, 1993Buffalo Bills W, 23-0 Oct. 3, 1994 Houston Oilers W, 30-14Nov. 14, 1994Buffalo Bills W, 23-10Nov. 13, 1995Cleveland Browns W, 20-3 Sept. 16, 1996 Buffalo Bills W, 24-6 Nov. 9, 1998 Green Bay Packers W, 27-20 Oct. 25, 1999Atlanta Falcons W, 13-9 Oct. 29, 2001Tennessee Titans W, 34-7 Oct. 21, 2002Indianapolis Colts W, 28-10 Oct. 31, 2005Baltimore Ravens W, 20-19 Nov. 5, 2007Baltimore Ravens W, 38-7Nov. 26, 2007Miami Dolphins W, 3-0 Sept. 28, 2008 Baltimore Ravens W, 23-20  (OT)Nov. 12, 2012Kansas City Chiefs W, 16-13 (OT)Oct. 20, 2014 Houston Texans W, 30-23 Sept. 30, 2019 Cincinnati Bengals W, 27-3 Oct. 28, 2019 Miami Dolphins W, 27-14 Nov. 8. 2021 Chicago Bears W, 29-27 Jan. 3, 2022 Cleveland Browns W, 26-14 Sept. 18, 2023Cleveland Browns W, 26-22 Oct. 28, 2024 New York Giants W, 26-18 Dec. 15, 2025 Miami Dolphins W, 28-15 Pittsburgh's home unbeaten streak on Monday night featured several memorable performances including: \nA dominant, 23-0 win over a Bills team that bounced Pittsburgh out the playoffs a year earlier in the 1992 AFC Divisional round. Jerome Bettis' coming out party as a Steeler in 1996 that included 133 rushing yards and two touchdowns in a blowout win over the Bills. A dramatic win over Brett Favre and the defending NFC champion Packers in 1998.A convincing win over Peyton Manning's Colts in 2002 that included a halftime ceremony for Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Two come-from-behind wins over the Ravens during the Steelers' two most recent Super Bowl-winning seasons. James Harrison's coming out party that included 3.5 sacks, three forced fumbles and a pick in a 2007 win over Baltimore. His return from retirement seven years later helped spark the Steelers to a win over the Texans on Monday night. Mason Rudolph led the Steelers to two convincing wins on Monday night in 2019 after replacing Ben Roethlisberger, who was out with a season-ending injury. Pittsburgh survives a gritty comeback attempt by future Steelers quarterback Justin Fields in 2021. The Steelers win a defensive duel against the Browns in 2021, Roethlisberger's final home game. Rodgers had one of his best games of the 2025 regular season on Monday night, going 23 of 27 for 224 yards and two scores during Pittsburgh's Week 15 win over Miami. \"I care about winning. That's why I'm here,\" quarterback Aaron Rodgers said entering kickoff. \"That's why I love the Monday to Saturday grind. And you know, stats are what they are, the trends are what they are, and those trends, any trend, is always meant to be broken at some point.

There was no drama in the final game of the wild-card round, however, with the Texans routing the Steelers, 30–6, on Monday night to earn the first road playoff win in franchise history. Houston became the eighth and final team to punch its ticket to the divisional round.In the AFC, the Texans will be joined by New England, Buffalo and Denver. The top-seeded Broncos, coming off a bye, will be in action for the first time this postseason when they host the Bills on Saturday. Houston, meanwhile, will head to New England on Sunday with a spot in the AFC Championship Game on the line.In the NFC, Seattle and San Francisco will meet for the third time this season after splitting their first two matchups. The Seahawks are well-rested after a wild-card bye, while the 49ers will be playing on just five days' rest. In the other divisional matchup, the Bears will host the Rams, marking Chicago's first home divisional-round game in 15 years.With that in mind, here's the full playoff schedule, including the dates and kickoff times for the divisional round.Wild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) Jaguars\nBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) SteelersTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick-six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history. Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17(6) Bills at (1) Broncos, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS)(6) 49ers at (1) Seahawks, 8 p.m. ET (Fox)Sunday, Jan. 18(5) Texans at (2) Patriots, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)(5) Rams at (2) Bears, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC Championship, 3 p.m. ET (CBS)NFC Championship, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        A UEFA Women's Champions League superstar and U.S. women's national team captain returns home. Denver Summit FC announced the signing of Colorado native Lindsey Heaps on Monday. The midfielder will join Summit FC following the conclusion of her 2025-26 campaign with OL Lyonnes. The U.S. midfielder has 170 appearances with the USWNT, is a 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, 2024 Olympic gold, and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist. She has aided the national team in winning multiple Concacaf trophies, won the U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year in 2021, and was named to he Best FIFA Women's XI in 2024. \"I'm incredibly excited to come home to Colorado and join Denver Summit FC,\" Heaps said. \"This club represents something special, not just for the league, but for this community and for the next generation of players growing up here. I'm fully committed to finishing the season strong with Lyon, and I can't wait to begin this next chapter in Denver this summer.\"A double homecomingHeaps, born in Golden, Colorado, will have a double homecoming of sorts when she returns in the summer -- first to her home state as a product of Colorado's youth system, and also back to the NWSL. \n\"Signing Lindsey Heaps is a defining moment for Denver Summit FC,\" said Denver Summit FC General Manager Curt Johnson. \"She represents the very highest level of excellence as a player, a leader, and a professional. To welcome her back home to Colorado and to have her help shape the identity of this club is incredibly meaningful.\"The 31-year-old midfielder made headlines as a teenager when she turned down her University of North Carolina scholarship to turn pro and start her club career with Paris Saint-Germain in 2012. Following a four-year stint in France, she signed with Portland Thorns FC in 2016 and won several accolades in nearly every season with the club, including the NWSL Shield (2016, 2021), NWSL Championship (2017), NWSL Challenge Cup (2021), and NWSL MVP (2018) before her departure in 2022 to OL Lyonnes.\"Lindsey will bring a world-class level to our team and represents the ambition of this club on-and-off the field,\" said Summit FC Head Coach Nick Cushing. \"Lindsey has won at every level of the game. Her leadership, talent, and professionalism will continue to raise the standard for Summit FC when she arrives this summer. We are thrilled to welcome a hometown player back to Denver as we work to win championships and grow our club and community.\"\nIs Lindsey Heaps the first high-impact player signing?Last month, the league board of governors voted to implement a new mechanism to sign and pay players without affecting the salary cap, called the High-Impact Player rule. It's a new method derived from the ongoing contract saga between U.S. women's national team winger Trinity Rodman and the NWSL. The new rules allow teams to spend an additional $1 million on players who meet specific \"star\" criteria. The ability to offer competitive salaries in a global transfer market rises remains a hurdle for the women's leagues around the world, though the NWSL specifically has seen an increase in players leaving for teams overseas. NWSL clubs will be able to exceed the league's current salary cap by $1 million and use the HIP funds toward single or multiple player contracts. The HIP threshold will also increase annually alongside the salary cap, which is currently $3.5 million and set to rise to $5.1 million by 2030. \nThe HIP rule will be effective as of July 1, but teams and clubs can immediately use the mechanism to sign high-profile athletes as long as contract structures are reflective of the new policy start date. No club has utilized the rule at this time, including Denver, though that could change according to Summit FC general manager Curt Johnson.\"As it relates to our desire to sign Lindsay, this was something that certainly predated the HIP rule,\" Johnson told media.\"So, our intention was to sign Lindsay, then the hip rule came along. We'll certainly work with the league to apply it in the best way we can that will positively impact our salary cap and our roster building.\"Denver's roster is still growing and is far from the 40-player preseason roster deadline due on Wednesday. With Heaps set to join the team during the summer, the club will continue to utilize opportunities to acquire players ahead of their inaugural season. \n\"When a player is assigned the HIP category, the salary cap charge is in the salary cap, and then there's a pool of money outside the salary cap, is how it works,\" Johnson said. \"But we're moving forward with the assumption that this will fall in the HIP category, and hopefully we're moving on to finding our next player that fits that category,\" he said.When will Lindsey Heaps debut for Denver?The midfielder is to join Summit FC following completion of her season with OL Lyonnes, and the NWSL's newest expansion franchise expects the midfielder's arrival in June. She's currently competing with the French side domestically and in the 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League.Heaps has already been part of several trophies with the European giants during her time with the club. She's won three Division 1 Féminine titles, a UWCL title, and the Coupe de France Féminine. Her signing is considered a high-profile addition to Denver's expansion roster building.\nWhile the club expects her arrival in June, when she makes her first appearance as a member of Summit FC is another thing entirely. The league has already announced that it will take a summer break during the men's 2026 FIFA World Cup from June 1 through 28. The month-long pause means regular-season games will likely resume the first weekend of July. When will Denver Summit play its first home game?The complete NWSL schedule is set for release at a later date, but the league unveiled a blueprint with key dates. Officially NWSL's 16th franchise, the Denver Summit will play its first game on Saturday, March 28. Billed as \"The Kickoff,\" the club will take the pitch at NFL stadium, Empower Field at Mile High, in Denver. The marquee event is scheduled to be televised on CBS, with the opponent to be announced during the official regular-season schedule announcement. \nWhat's nextThe club continues to build its roster ahead of the 2026 NWSL regular season. While Lindsey Heaps' arrival won't impact the team till the second half of the year, there are still plenty of league-experienced players already on part of Denver's inaugural roster. The club signed free agents Ally Watt and Kaleigh Kurtz, and recently acquired Canadian international Janine Sonis. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Columbus Blue Jackets have fired coach Dean Evason and replaced him with Rick Bowness, the team announced on Monday. Evason was just halfway through his second season with the team, which makes this move a surprising one. Assistant coach Steve McCarthy was also dismissed.After Evason helped the Blue Jackets exceed expectations last season, the front office was expecting even more in the current campaign, but that hasn't materialized. Columbus is 19-19-7 and sits in the basement of the Eastern Conference. In a statement, Blue Jackets general manager Don Waddell cited underachievement as the primary reason for Evason's firing.\"This season has been a frustrating one for all of us and the bottom line is we are not performing at a level that meets our expectations. We all share in that responsibility, me included, and while this was not a decision that was made lightly it is one that needed to be made at this time,\" said Waddell. \"Dean did a tremendous job last year under extremely difficult circumstances and I thank him for that. I also want to thank Steve for his commitment to our club over the past five years.\"Prior to the 2024-25 season, Evason's first with the Blue Jackets, star forward Johnny Gaudreau died in an offseason accident. In the face of a shocking tragedy, Evason led Columbus to a 40-33-9 as the team finished just two points outside the playoffs.\nFollowing that performance, the Blue Jackets wanted to make that playoff leap in 2025-26, even though the team didn't make any major moves in the offseason. Veteran center Sean Monahan hasn't been as effective, and some young players have stalled in their development. Adam Fantilli and Kent Johnson were poised for big seasons, but that have both regressed to one degree or another.The Blue Jackets wasted no time in replacing Evason, bringing in the veteran Bowness, who boasts more than 40 years of coaching experience. Bowness has spent 14 seasons as a coach in the NHL -- either as an interim or in a full-time role. Over that span, Bowness has compiled a 310-408-48-37 record. In 2019-20, as an interim with the Dallas Stars, Bowness led the team to the Stanley Cup Final before getting promoted to a the full-time role.Most recently, Bowness spent two seasons behind the bench for the Winnipeg Jets from 2022-24. In his second season with Winnipeg, Bowness stepped away from the team twice as he and his wife battled health issues. Bowness led the Jets to a 98-57-9 record and two first-round playoff exits.\nCompetitive East raised Blue Jackets' urgencyThe competitive nature of the Eastern Conference probably pushed the Blue Jackets into making this move. No team is below .500, and despite being in last place, Columbus is just seven points out of a playoff spot. If the Blue Jackets get hot for two weeks, their entire outlook could change.For that reason, no team in the East is truly out of playoff contention, but what is the end goal for Columbus here? Even if they reached the playoffs, is this roster capable of going on a deep run? I don't think so. Columbus has one of the most underwhelming collections of centers in the league, and the forward group as a whole lacks firepower. Zach Werenski leads the team with 47 points -- 10 more than anyone else -- and he's a defenseman.The goaltending has been serviceable, thanks solely to the efforts of Jet Greaves because backup Elvis Merzlikins is having anotehr abysmal season with 9.35 goals allowed above average, per Natural Stat Trick. Stack Columbus up against teams like the Tampa Bay Lightning or Carolina Hurricanes, its most likely first-round opponents, and there is no comparison.\nManagement in Columbus clearly believes this team should be winning more often because it gave up second- and fourth-round picks to acquire winger Mason Marchment from the Seattle Kraken last month. It did recoup that draft capital by sending Yegor Chinakhov to the Pittsburgh Penguins, but clearly Waddell wants to see more out of this group. I'm just not sure that's realistic.Perhaps the belief within the building was that Evason wasn't developing young players like Fantilli, Johnson or Cole Sillinger well enough. That would be a fair critique given the performance of that trio in 2025-26 (21 goals and 39 assists), but is hiring the 70-year-old Bowness the answer there? He'll have to reach those developing players for the Jackets to turn their season around.Ultimately, Evason was a victim of his own success in 2024-25 and an unusually competitive Eastern Conference in 2025-26. Perhaps Bowness can spark the Blue Jackets, but this seems like a strange decision that only creates more instability in Columbus as the team brings in its sixth coach since 2021.\n            ",

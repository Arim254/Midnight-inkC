    "body": "\nThe 2025-26 NBA season is just over a week away as the action tips on Tuesday, Oct. 21 with a two-game slate of Rockets vs. Thunder and Warriors vs. Lakers. That means the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings are beginning to solidify, with the latest Fantasy basketball ADP listing Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Victor Wembanyama as the top consensus picks. Veterans such as Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards are also popular first-round picks. LeBron James has an ADP of No. 21 as he's set to miss a few weeks with sciatica on his right side. Can you trust those Fantasy basketball picks at the top of drafts, and which Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts do you need to be aware of? Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings.   Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. After spending the 2023-24 season out of the league, Porter joined the Clippers last season before being acquired by Milwaukee at the trade deadline. He proceeded to become one of the Bucks most consistent players, averaging 11.7 points and 3.7 assists in just 19.9 minutes, and over his last five games of the season, Porter put up 20.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.8 steals. Porter should see a huge jump in playing time this year with the injury and subsequent trade of Damian Lillard.Porter is penciled in to be Milwaukee's starting point guard, and outside of Giannis Antetokounmpo, no other player on the Bucks' 2025-26 roster averaged more than 2.9 assists last year. Thus, the team will need both his ball-handling and playmaking skills, and Porter has already shown he can produce when given ample minutes. In the 2022-23 season with Houston, he was one of just five NBA players to average at least 19 points, five rebounds, five assists and 1.4 steals per game. He is someone whose production should far exceed his 2025 Fantasy basketball ADP of 93. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier, who has an ADP of 137. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year.Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was one of the major pieces in a trade between the Wizards and Pelicans in the offseason. The 26-year-old now goes to New Orleans, where he'll have to be a bit more of a complimentary player to Zion Williamson. New Orleans also brings in two lottery picks -- Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears -- so Poole could lose some of his scoring opportunities as the season progresses. Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are being picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well. How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts. This player is a top-3 Fantasy option at his position and is ranked ahead of stars like Kevin Durant and Paolo Banchero. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings for every player, at SportsLine.So which 2025-26 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which forward shocks the NBA as a top-3 player in positional rankings? Visit SportsLine now to get 2025-26 Fantasy basketball cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that's nailed its Fantasy basketball picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks and coach Jason Kidd have agreed to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Tuesday. The agreement comes just over a week before the team's season opener against the San Antonio Spurs. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Kidd, 52, served as Mavericks coach for the last four seasons and posted a 179-149 record over that span. That includes a trip to the 2024 NBA Finals, where Dallas lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. Prior to his time in Dallas, he spent two seasons as a Lakers assistant after three-plus seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, where he went 139-152. He got his coaching start in 2013-14 with the Brooklyn Nets, where he went 44-38 in one season before being traded to Milwaukee.Kidd became the subject of several coaching search conversations over the past few years, and the Mavericks denied the New York Knicks a chance to interview him for their vacancy earlier this offseason.\n        \n            \n                NBA coach rankings: All 30 coaches split into eight tiers as 2025-26 season begins\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA Hall of Fame inductee as a player in 2018, Kidd faces a big season with the Mavericks. Dallas stunningly dealt away Luka Doncić to the Los Angeles Lakers in early February 2025, receiving Anthony Davis, among others, in return. The trade was widely panned, and things went from bad to worse in Dallas when Davis was injured in his team debut and Kyrie Irving later tore his ACL. The injury-ravaged Mavericks finished 39-43 and got into the Play-In Tournament, where they beat the Sacramento Kings but lost to the Memphis Grizzlies with a playoff berth on the line.\nThen the Mavericks' fortunes miraculously reversed when they won the NBA Draft lottery despite having just a 1.8% chance to do so. That allowed Dallas to select Cooper Flagg, the consensus player of the year at Duke last season who has already impressed in the preseason.With Flagg in the fold alongside Davis, Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford, the Mavericks figure to have a fearsome frontcourt defense, with Klay Thompson and Max Christie among key wings returning. Free agent signee D'Angelo Russell will be the team's lead ballhandler until Irving returns, if Irving returns at all this season.\nDallas is slightly favored to miss the playoffs (-138) at FanDuel Sportsbook, though if things go well health-wise and Flagg can make an immediate impact, the team will likely field one of the NBA's best defenses and contend for the postseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers -- sorry, the defending World Series champion Dodgers -- are up 2-0 in the best-of-seven NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers, who had the best record in baseball in the regular season. They are 7-1 in the playoffs this season, including 4-0 on the road against teams that finished with a better regular-season record.How are the Dodgers doing it? Look no further than the NLCS Game 2 hero. It might take a bit of an adjustment after these last several years, but the Dodgers are putting the focus back on the starting pitcher. In Game 2, the Dodgers' starter finished it. It was Yoshinobu Yamamoto starring for the Dodgers with MLB's first complete game in the playoffs since 2017. In Game 1 against the Brewers, it was Blake Snell shining for eight innings.The 2025 Dodgers are bringing back the Main Character Starting Pitcher. Game planning can be cyclical in sports. Often, the teams ahead of the proverbial curve are the ones who have the most success. The Dodgers have been one of the teams at the forefront of changes for years and it appears to be happening again. Last year, we saw them win the World Series with a rotation that featured Yamamoto, Jack Flaherty, Walker Buehler and a bullpen game. They didn't usually take starters deep into games and pieced things together with a bevy of relievers, while also relying on good offense. \nThis time around, the Dodgers are rendering their bullpen meaningless by having morphed their rotation into a stable of workhorses.\nI pointed out heading to the NLDS that the Dodgers were going to do this to guard against a leaky bullpen. Their starters are absolutely stacking up innings pitched, even more so than I expected. All the while, they are holding opposing offenses in check. That is to say, they aren't just racking up innings. They are doing so while dominating. Snell, notorious for not being able to get deep into games in his career due to erratic control and high pitch counts, has gone 21 innings in three starts with a 0.86 ERA. He has established a new career high in innings during a playoff start in two of his three outings. The eight innings he threw in Game 1 were the second-highest of his career including the regular season. \nYamamoto has now gone 19 ⅔ innings in three starts after throwing the first complete game in the playoffs since Justin Verlander did so in 2017 (also: Kudos to my colleague Mike Axisa for correctly predicting we'd see a complete game). It was the first Dodgers' playoff complete game since all the way back in 2004 (Jose Lima). How about that, huh? A complete game in the playoffs!Shohei Ohtani went six innings in his only playoff start to this point and he only averaged 3 ⅓ innings a start during the regular season as he built back up from elbow surgery. Tyler Glasnow in his only start so far also went six innings. That is eight Dodgers playoff games with an average of 6 ⅔ innings per start. Have you glanced around the rest of the teams to find the assortment of openers and bullpen games and shorter starts? The Brewers aren't even averaging three innings a start. The Mariners have a rotation of starters and haven't used an opener or bullpen game, but they are averaging a touch less than five innings per start. The Tigers have Tarik Skubal, but averaged less than five innings per start in eight games. The Phillies also had a full rotation and averaged five innings per start, exactly. \nFor a good reference point, the MLB average during the regular season was 5.2 innings per start, or less than 5 ⅓ innings. The Phillies at 5 ⅔ innings per start led the majors. The Dodgers in the playoffs are dwarfing that and the average is only going up. Putting aside the polarizing Dodgers being the ones to do this, fellow fans of the starting-pitcher-as-main-character have to be ecstatic seeing this. I noted above that teams ahead the curve can have success. Just as often, other teams notice what is happening and try to emulate that success. Of course, it helps to have deep pockets and ridiculous talent. The Dodgers dealt with injuries to their rotation for much of the season, but things really lined up well for the playoffs, to the point that starters like Clayton Kershaw, Roki Sasaki and Emmet Sheehan were moved to the bullpen. Glasnow has also had an outing in relief. \nThere are a good number of teams where any one from the group of Snell, Yamamoto and Glasnow would be their No. 1 starter and Ohtani throws like a frontline starter as well. It's an embarrassment of riches, which, yes, most other teams can't afford. Still, they have to go out and perform and the Dodgers' stable of stallions is doing the job like no team we've seen in a century.That foursome has a 1.54 ERA so far in the playoffs and, again, that's with a heavy workload. If we sort for a minimum of seven games, that's the lowest postseason ERA in the last 100 years. They've struck out 63 against only 13 walks in their 52 ⅔ innings. \nWhile the Reds didn't have a very good offense, the Phillies (8th in MLB in runs) and Brewers (3rd) were two of the best offenses in baseball this season. The Dodgers starters have held the Brewers to one run in 17 innings in two NLCS games. The Phillies did get them for some runs, but they still posted a 1.92 ERA and got six scoreless innings from both Snell and Glasnow. If the Dodgers are going to become the first repeat champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees, it'll have been on the strength of their rotation and the resurrection of a thing that looked like it was dying a slow death these last handful of postseasons.Welcome back, Main Character Starting Pitcher. You've been missed. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Veteran infielder Alex Bregman will be opting out of his contract the Boston Red Sox and becoming a free agent this coming offseason, the New York Post reports. Bregman, 31, is coming off a highly productive 2025 season for Boston in which he slashed .273/.360/.462 (128 OPS+) with 18 home runs and 28 doubles. Although he was limited to 114 games played because of a serious quad strain, Bregman still managed a WAR of 3.5 for the season. He earned his third career All-Star selection. For his career, Bregman boasts an OPS+ of 132 and a WAR of 43.1 across parts of 10 MLB seasons. \nLast winter, Bregman turned down a higher offer from the Detroit Tigers in order to sign a shorter-term deal with the Red Sox. That deal paid him $36.67 million for 2025 and includes $41.67 million salaries for both 2026 and 2027 with opt-outs after each of those seasons. Since Bregman on a rate basis enjoyed his best offensive season since 2022, he and agent Scott Boras are betting he'll have a healthier market in the coming 2025-26 offseason. \nThat upcoming free-agent class includes position players like Kyle Tucker, Pete Alonso, Bo Bichette, and Kyle Schwarber. However, at third base -- Bregman's primary position this past season -- only Eugenio Suárez stands out. Boston figures to make an effort to bring Bregman back for 2026 and beyond, and other teams possibly in need of help or upgrades at third base include the Tigers, Seattle Mariners, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, and Texas Rangers. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        South Carolina is entering the 2025-26 season as the national champion runner-up and the No. 2 team in the nation, but the Gamecocks are having to adjust after losing star forward Chloe Kitts to a torn ACL. Although it is a significant loss, coach Dawn Staley said the team still feels confident moving forward without her.\"It's not like we're going to ask someone to be Chloe because that's impossible,\" Staley said at the SEC media day on Tuesday. \"But we're unafraid to go into the season without Chloe. We're not going to skip a beat. Our players know that anytime we sustain any kind of injury, we believe in the system that we put together. We believe in the players we've assembled.\"...We'll figure out a way and we'll make adjustments. I'm somewhat glad it happened at this time when you don't have to make adjustments midseason. You go with who is healthy to go.\"\nKitts has been a key part of South Carolina's back-to-back championship appearances. She started 38 games last year while averaging 10.2 points and a team-best 7.7 rebounds per game. Her veteran leadership will still be valuable from the sideline, but her teammates roles will have to change without her on the court.Florida State transfer Ta'Niya Latson has been the most talked-about addition to the roster since she led the nation in scoring last year. However, former Mississippi State center Madina Okot will also play an important role in the frontcourt with Kitts out and forward Ashlyn Watkins taking this season off to work on her personal life. Last season with the Bulldogs, Okot averaged 11.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.1 blocks in the 34 games she started. \nMeanwhile, forward Joyce Edwards had a strong freshman season coming off the bench. She led the Gamecocks in scoring with 12.7 points per contest and was the third most consistent rebounder behind Kitts and Watkins.\"Joyce is probably going to take the brunt of it because she just has more playing experience under us, but the same conversations I'm having with Joyce, with or without Chloe, I'm having,\" Staley said.Staley's rosters typically have depth and don't rely on one particular player. In this particular area, the coach pointed out that sophomore Adhel Tac is \"much improved\" and senior Maryam Dauda is playing \"extremely well.\"\"I just really need them to be themselves,\" Staley said of her players. \nThe Gamecocks will tip off their 2025-26 season on Nov. 3 against Grand Canyon.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Portland Fire are expected to hire Alex Sarama as the first coach in franchise history, according to Annie Costabile of Front Office Sports. The Portland Supporter first reported Tuesday that the Fire had inadvertently announced Sarama's hiring on their LinkedIn page before it was swiftly deleted. Sarama is currently an assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers, having previously served as the team's director of player development. Prior to joining the Cavs, Sarama was an assistant coach and director of player development for the Rip City Remix, the Portland Trail Blazers' G League affiliate. Sarama, who hails from England, also worked with Paris Basketball and the London Lions earlier in his career. Outside of his work with professional teams, Sarama founded Transforming Basketball in 2023 with a mission to \"transform the basketball world by helping individuals and organizations make sense of an evidence-based approach.\" Sarama is a leading proponent of Constraints-Led Approach, or CLA, a method of training that is taking the sports world by storm. Here is a quick explanation of CLA, via The Athletic's Jared Weiss last month:\"The CLA takes the ground-up approach of block training, which eliminates the infinite variables that affect athletes in the heat of competition, and flips it on its head.\"That means putting players into scenarios with different limitations called \"constraints\" to simulate the unpredictable environment of an actual game. Whether it's the number of steps they can take, the area of the playing surface from which they are allowed to maneuver or even the weight of the ball they are using, players are repeatedly told to overcome restrictions to accomplish a task. While painstakingly working through mistakes, they are forced to find advantageous opportunities, \"affordances\" in CLA parlance.\"With the Cavaliers, Sarama designed practices and individual development plans for players, and played a major role in the team's leap from 48 wins in 2024 to 64 wins in 2025 with largely the same roster. The Fire will hope that Sarama, or \"Professor Alex,\" as he came to be known with the Cavaliers, can have the same impact in Portland as their journey as a franchise begins. \nThis is not the first time that the Fire have had a mishap with a major announcement. In June, a month before their branding was officially announced, trademark applications for the \"Portland Fire\" and related logos were published by Sean Highkin of The Rose Garden Report. The Fire were officially introduced as the WNBA's 15th team in September of 2024, and will begin play next season as part of the league's expansion push. The first incarnation of the Fire lasted from 2000-02 before the team folded due to financial issues. \"As a city that has long championed women's sports, Portland is ready to reclaim its place in the WNBA and reignite its connection to the game on the world stage,\" Clare Hamill, the team's interim president, said in July. \"We are thrilled to complete the journey of bringing professional women's basketball back to the Rose City, while honoring the legacy of the original franchise to blaze a new, bold path forward.\"Prior to reportedly hiring Sarama, the Fire have been building out their front office. Inky Son, their first president, was suddenly fired in June, after just three months on the job. Hamill, a long-time Nike executive was hired as her replacement on an interim basis and remains in the role. In August, the team announced it had hired Vanja Černivec as their general manager. Černivec previously worked with the Golden State Valkyries as their vice president of basketball operations, and helped them have the best inaugural season by an expansion club in league history in 2025. On Tuesday, the Fire also announced the hiring of Ashley Battle as vice president of basketball operations, strategy and innovation. Battle played in the WNBA from 2005-2010 and most recently worked as a scout for the Boston Celtics and a television commentator for the Connecticut Sun.\nThe next step for the Fire will be their expansion draft, but it's unclear when that will happen, or how it will work with the Toronto Tempo also entering the league next season. Expansion draft rules have to be collectively bargained, so the league cannot set a date until a new collective bargaining agreement is in place. If the expansion draft ends up being delayed due to the contentious labor battle between the WNBPA and the WNBA, that could actually benefit Hamill, Černivec and Sarama, who would have more time to prepare. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers and Seattle Mariners are both two wins away from reaching the 2025 World Series. Both teams pulled off two consecutive road wins to open the LCS round of the 2025 MLB playoffs. The Dodgers are up 2-0 against the Milwaukee Brewers after Yoshinobu Yamamoto threw a complete game gem in Tuesday's Game 2 win. The Dodgers, now 7-1 in the playoffs, allowed just two runs to the Brewers in the first two games of the NLCS.In the ALCS, the Mariners are heading to Seattle with a 2-0 series lead over the Toronto Blue Jays. The Mariners will host Game 3 on Wednesday night, and the franchise is two wins away from its first ever appearance in the Fall Classic.The Mariners punched their ticket to their first ALCS since 2001 last week by eliminating the Tigers in 15 innings in a winner-take-all ALDS Game 5. The Blue Jays knocked out the Yankees in the ALDS. The Dodgers, meanwhile, took out the Phillies in four games in the NLDS, and the Brewers got past the Cubs in five games.The LCS round could wrap up as early as this weekend, and the 2025 World Series begins on Oct. 24.

    "body": "\n        Al Horford stood in limbo for the majority of the NBA offseason as an unrestricted free agent. In the end, the longtime Boston Celtics standout made a difficult decision to sign elsewhere. He agreed in late September to a two-year deal with the Golden State Warriors, ending his second stint in Boston, where he won the first championship of his career. The decision was twofold, said Horford, who indicated that he and the Celtics had different priorities for the 2025-26 season.This late in Horford's career, opportunities to add another championship ring are dwindling. He already reached the mountaintop with the Celtics, but with Jayson Tatum set to miss at least the majority, if not all, of the upcoming campaign with a torn Achilles tendon, Horford's best chance of winning another title may not be in Boston.\n        \n            \n                Warriors vs. Lakers: Stephen Curry's synergy with Al Horford immediately on display in preseason opener\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"There was two things there,\" Horford, 39, said to The Athletic. \"I think the financial part was a component, but more than that, it was the winning part of it, trying to contend for a championship. And I think there was a lot of things up in the air -- and it just felt like they weren't in that same vision, obviously, because JT getting hurt, that takes a big toll. Up until then I was staying in Boston the whole time.\"The Celtics were in a tricky spot financially this offseason because of the second apron. They traded Kristaps Porziņġis and Jrue Holiday in salary-shedding moves and watched as key reserve Luke Kornet walked in free agency. The talent exodus was in many ways a necessity.\nBecause of those departures and Tatum's potential to miss the entire season, the Celtics project to take a step backward from their perennial spot in the Eastern Conference's upper echelon.\"I think once that offseason happened and it started to progress, it became clear to me the team had different priorities,\" Horford said. \"Obviously, getting rid of Jrue, getting rid of Kristaps. And I know it's all salary stuff, but it was like a domino effect, and it was tough for me.\"Horford's exit is another blow to the Celtics, whose frontcourt became thinner with each departure. He left a legacy across two stints with the franchise as an integral part of the 2024 championship run and one of the NBA's top defenders on an annual basis. He remained highly prominent in the Celtics' lineup even at age 38.\nGolden State is, on paper, a terrific landing spot for Horford. He was everything the Celtics needed him to be, and he should fit just as well with the Warriors because of his defensive versatility and ability to step outside the 3-point line on the other end of the floor.\n            ",

Kiffin's fifth-ranked Ole Miss Rebels are one of only two unbeaten SEC teams left on the board and are looking to win their second straight against the No. 9 Georgia Bulldogs for the only the second time since 1990.\"I think in five years, in the regular season, they've only lost to Alabama and then in our game here last year ... so it's a very challenging team to always play, especially there,\" Kiffin said. \"So we're going to have to have a great week of preparation and prepare to go on the road in a very tough environment with elite players and a phenomenal coaching staff, led by Kirby (Smart) and what he's been able to do.\"I said yesterday in the call (with media) when asked that he finds a way to win a lot of games in a lot of different styles and overcome a lot of adversity in games and keep his team together. That's why he's the best coach in college football now.\" Gunning for their first playoff appearance in program history, the Rebels control their destiny the rest of the way with Saturday's game marking one of only two left on the slate against a ranked opponent.\nQuarterback Trinidad Chambliss is the Rebels' breakout star, who signed after spring camp from Division II Ferris State to be Austin Simmons' primary backup. However, with Simmons on the mend in recent weeks, Chambliss led Ole Miss to several marquee victories including a 24-19 decision over LSU.\"They get the best players in the country and Kirby, I think like coach Saban, recruits size and speed and it's always really obvious with them, especially in warmups when you're out there,\" Kiffin said.\nOver his first five seasons, Kiffin has three top 15 finishes and in the portal era, has shown an adept acumen for transfer talent. That's a different philosophy for the most part from Smart's recruiting strengths, but Kiffin has a chance to do what few have done in the SEC against him this weekend — beat him for the second straight year.\n            \n    ",

The former No. 18 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft tore his ACL in practice last year, and then broke his collarbone during a training camp practice session in July. The Titans infamously selected Burks with the pick acquired from the Philadelphia Eagles in the A.J. Brown trade. He failed to live up to expectations, catching 53 passes for 699 yards and one touchdown in just 27 career games played. Injuries unfortunately headlined Burks' career to date, as he's never played more than 11 games in a single season. However, just 25 years old, Burks could benefit from a change of scenery.\nThe Broncos' passing attack has been disappointing this season, as it ranks No. 16 in the NFL (206.8 passing yards per game). Courtland Sutton is the only wide receiver averaging over 42 yards per game. Bo Nix completed just 4 of 10 passes for 49 yards in the second half of the ugly win over the New York Jets Sunday in London, and his 88.2 passer rating ranks No. 24 in the NFL.As for the Commanders' potential interest in Burks, their wide receiver room is injured. Terry McLaurin missed the last three games due to a quad injury, Noah Brown only played two games this season due to groin and knee injuries, then Deebo Samuel played through a heel injury during Washington's Monday night loss to the Chicago Bears. Chris Moore and rookie Jaylin Lane emerged as Jayden Daniels' leading receivers in Week 6. \nBurks was a legitimate star at Arkansas, and picked up First Team All-SEC honors in 2021 after catching 66 passes for 1,104 yards and 11 touchdowns in 12 games played. However, he struggled to find his footing in the NFL. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nWith one week of the 2025-26 NHL season in the books, a total of eight teams have yet to suffer a regulation loss. However, only three of those clubs played more than two games, and one of them was in action four times. That team is the Colorado Avalanche.Colorado, which has eclipsed the 100-point mark in each of the past four seasons, won three of its first four contests, and its lone blemish was a shootout loss to the Dallas Stars. The Avalanche entered Week 2 with an NHL-high seven points, one more than the two-time reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers and Boston Bruins.Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and their overall bodies of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings for Week 1 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few more teams of note.NHL Week 1 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (3-0-1)The Avalanche allowed just one goal in their victories over the Los Angeles Kings, Utah Mammoth and Buffalo Sabres, and Scott Wedgewood posted a 1.72 goals-against average while playing in all four of the team's games. Offensively, 2024 Hart Trophy winner Nathan MacKinnon has gotten off to a fast start as he is tied for second in the NHL with four goals and shares the league lead in points (eight) with teammate Martin Necas. Both have recorded three multi-point performances, while Cale Makar tops all NHL defensemen with five points. 2. Florida Panthers (3-1-0)The Panthers opened the season with three consecutive victories, defeating the Chicago Blackhawks, Philadelphia Flyers and Ottawa Senators. The most impressive thing about their start was the fact they did it without Matthew Tkachuk, who likely will be sidelined until December following groin surgery, and captain Aleksander Barkov, who figures to miss the entire campaign after undergoing knee surgery. Florida's winning streak ended with Monday's 5-2 loss at Philadelphia, although the club rallied from a 2-0 deficit to forge a tie before allowing the go-ahead goal with less than five minutes remaining in the third period. Brad Marchand and Anton Lundell share the team lead with four points apiece, and both have landed on the scoresheet in each of the Panthers' last three games.3. Boston Bruins (3-1-0)The Bruins also won their first three contests of 2025-26 before dropping a 4-3 decision to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday. Boston is tied with Colorado, Florida and the Minnesota Wild for the most goals in the NHL with 13, while David Pastrnak and Pavel Zacha both have registered a tally and four assists to top the club with five points. The Bruins likely won't keep up their scoring pace due to a lack of depth, but it's nice to see them start strong after having missed the playoffs last season for the first time since 2016.4. Nashville Predators (2-0-1)The Predators went on a spending spree last offseason and the return was dismal as they finished 30th in the league, failing to qualify for the postseason for the second time in three campaigns. They began 2024-25 with a five-game losing streak and never were able to get to .500, so seeing them start this season with two wins and an overtime loss to Utah is encouraging. Two-time All-Star Juuse Saros posted a 1.64 GAA as Nashville allowed only five goals over its first three games, while Filip Forsberg and Erik Haula -- who is on his second tour of duty with the club -- recorded a point in each contest.5. Dallas Stars (2-0-0)The Stars gave up four goals in both of their games thus far but came away unscathed, edging the 2024-25 Presidents' Trophy-winning Winnipeg Jets in regulation and Colorado in a shootout. Mikko Rantanen and defenseman Thomas Harley lead the team with four points apiece, while Jason Robertson and Wyatt Johnston both have scored twice. Meanwhile, blue-liner Nils Lundkvist already has three points after registering only five in 39 games last season.6. Carolina Hurricanes (2-0-0)The Hurricanes are just two games into 2025-26 and have three players with multiple goals. One is Seth Jarvis, who tallied twice in the team's season-opening 6-3 triumph over the New Jersey Devils and scored the overtime winner against the Flyers. Defenseman K'Andre Miller also tallied twice versus New Jersey in his debut with Carolina and Taylor Hall converted in both of the team's contests.7. Seattle Kraken (2-0-0)After finishing next-to-last in the Pacific Division last season, the Kraken have won their first two games for the first time in the franchise's brief five-season history. They were strong defensively in those contests, allowing just one goal in victories over the Anaheim Ducks and Vegas Golden Knights. Jared McCann, who was Seattle's goal-scoring leader in each of its first three seasons, scored in both games, netting the winner against Vegas four seconds before overtime was set to conclude.8. Detroit Red Wings (2-1-0)Yes, the Red Wings opened 2025-26 with a 5-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens. But they bounced back by sweeping a home-and-home series with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who won three of the four meetings between the Atlantic Division rivals last season. Detroit produced nine goals in the wins, with eight different players lighting the lamp. Lucas Raymond tallied twice in Saturday's 6-3 home triumph, while Mason Appleton scored with 45 seconds remaining in the third period at Toronto on Monday to give the Red Wings a 3-2 victory. Captain Dylan Larkin, who shares the team lead in goals with Raymond, notched a point in each of Detroit's first three contests.9. Minnesota Wild (2-1-0)The Wild are tied for the NHL lead in goals thanks to their power play, which was outstanding during the first week of the season. Minnesota went 8-for-17 with the man advantage over its first three games for a ridiculous conversion rate of 47.1% and cashed in seven times on 14 opportunities over its last two contests. Kirill Kaprizov recorded three power-play goals and is tied with teammate Matt Boldy and Jack Eichel of the Golden Knights for third in the NHL with seven points. The 28-year-old Kaprizov is one man-advantage tally away from matching the total he registered in 41 games last season.10. Winnipeg Jets (2-1-0)Winnipeg's top two offensive players in 2024-25 picked up where they left off, landing on the scoresheet in each of the team's first three games this campaign. Kyle Connor, who set a career high with 97 points last season, recorded his seventh hat trick in the NHL in the Jets' season-opening 5-4 loss to Dallas and notched one assist in victories over Los Angeles and the New York Islanders. Mark Scheifele set up each of Connor's goals against the Stars, netted a pair of tallies -- including the winner -- in a 3-2 triumph over the Kings and added an empty-netter in  Monday's 5-2 win versus the Islanders. Morgan Barron (two goals, two assists) also figured in the scoring in each of Winnipeg's contests and is on pace to obliterate the career high of 21 points he set in 2022-23.\n            ",

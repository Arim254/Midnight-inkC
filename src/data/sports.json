The deepest division in the sport has long been one of its most exciting. Coming off of Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett last week, UFC fans are treated to another all-action collision between a rising star and a veteran. Hooker is one of the toughest predators in a shark-infested lightweight division. In 2023, he gritted through a fractured arm and orbital bone to beat Jalin Turner. His 2020 clash with Dustin Poirier is fondly remembered as arguably the best fight that year. Hooker has been an elite lightweight for a long time, but has often been a half-step behind his contemporaries. A win on Saturday almost guarantees him one more high-profile fight in a career full of them. \nSaint Denis is cut from a different cloth. The French special forces soldier has knocked out or tapped out every opponent he has beaten. He fell short of high expectations against Poirier and Renato Moicano, but rejuvenated himself after switching teams. Saint Denis now trains with top middleweight contender Nassourdine Imavov. It's done wonders for his career, empowering him to a three-fight win streak. Beating Hooker is a big deal, but what comes after is truly exciting. Saint Denis is knocking on the door of the lightweight elite. With a growing reputation as the division's most potent offensive force, there are only big fights on his horizon.\nRafael Fiziev vs. Mauricio RuffyUFC fans are being treated to a swathe of exciting lightweight fights to start the Paramount+ era: Gaethje vs. Pimblett, Hooker vs. Sanit Denis and Max Holloway vs. Charles Oliveira. The lightweight showcase continues here. Fiziev is the better pure Muay Thai lightweight striker, but two losses to Gaethje stopped him from advancing in the division. He looks to rebuild against a fellow finisher. Ruffy is a true KO artist, knocking out 11 of his 12 victims. The Brazilian striker came to prominence with The Fighting Nerds but started training with UFC featherweight champion Volkanovski after his loss to Saint Denis. Ruffy's fellow Fighting Nerds, Carlos Prates and Jean Silva, got back on track after a tough start to 2025. Ruffy plans to do the same. It's not often that two fighters with spinning wheel KOs on their resume fight each other. That tells you everything you need to know about Fiziev vs. Ruffy.Quillan Salkilld vs. Jamie MullarkeyThis entry is more about a fighter than the fight. Salkilld spun heads, figuratively and literally, with a nasty head kick KO against longtime UFC veteran Nasrat Haqparast. Salkilld's stoppage was awarded CBS Sports' 2025 KO of the Year. The ferocious kick left Haqparast unconscious for several minutes. It was a scary sight for everyone, even Salkilld looked concerned. Fortunately, Haqparast came to. The memorable finish raised Salkilld's profile, and he has the potential to be a reliable Oceanic star. Mullarkey, a seven-year UFC veteran struggling with consistency, steps up on short notice against the rising prospect. It's a battle of West vs. East Australia in Sydney.\nHonorable mention: Tai Tuivasa vs. Tallison Texieira\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open begins on Thursday with a strong field headed to the Torrey Pines South Course in San Diego. Scottie Scheffler, who won his 2026 season debut at The American Express, isn't playing this week, opening up the field a bit for big names such as Xander Schueffele, Ludvig Aberg and Patrick Cantlay. Schauffele, the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 6 in the OWGR, is the +1300 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds from FanDuel Sportsbook. Aberg is close behind at +1700, followed by Cantlay at +1900 and Cameron Young at +2200.Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka is a +6000 longshot as he makes his PGA Tour return after recently leaving LIV Golf. The first tee times come at 12:10 p.m. ET. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open 2026 picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its golf betting picks since that point, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship.

Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Farmers Insurance Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the Farmers Insurance Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites, stumbles and falls well out of the top 5. He's a golfer to fade this week. Kim is off to a hot start this season with a T11 at the Sony Open and a T6 at The American Express last week. He was in the final group on Sunday before before a fourth-round 72. This event has been a struggle for Kim, however, as he has no top-10 finishes in eight tries and has missed the cut twice in his last appearances at this tournament. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Cantlay one of the best betting values this week. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. He finished T13 at The American Express with four sub-70 rounds. The California native doesn't have a great track record at this event, but he did shoot a first-round 65 last year at Torrey Pines before struggling over the weekend. The model is projecting a more consistent effort for him this year and has him as one of its top 2026 Farmers Insurance Open contenders as McClure says \"Cantlay is a core outright bet target this week.\" See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Farmers Insurance Open picksThe model is targeting several other longshots, including a massive +28000 underdog who is \"the best positive EV longshot on the board.\" You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz is \"upset\" after being passed over in favor of Todd Monken for the team's head-coaching job and doesn't plan on staying with the franchise, according to NFL Network.Schwartz assumed the lead defensive role in Cleveland ahead of the 2023 season and has provided stability on his side of the football for the Browns. He was one of three finalists for the team's coaching vacancy following the firing of Kevin Stefanski and is currently under contract through the 2026 campaign.The Browns announced Wednesday the hiring of Monken, who worked as the Baltimore Ravens' offensive coordinator each of the past three seasons. Reportedly disappointed after the Browns informed him of their choice, Schwartz has a decision to make on his future in Cleveland, where he hoped to become a head coach again for the first time since 2013 with the Detroit Lions.Monken reportedly is \"open\" to keeping Schwartz as his defensive play-caller, but that will be a discussion from both sides.\n        \n            \n                Cleveland Browns hire ex-Ravens OC Todd Monken as coach\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's important for the entire organization to keep Jim Schwartz and he's under contract, but I don't think the Cleveland Browns are going to hold Jim Schwartz hostage, necessarily,\" CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones said Wednesday. \"I would just appeal to anyone's human conditions and sensibilities where if you're up for a job and you believe you deserve the job, and you lose out on the job and they say, 'yeah, but we still want you for the exact same position because we're telling you we believe that's your ceiling' ... Do you want to stay there?\n\"That's difficult, right? I believe the San Francisco 49ers, needing a defensive coordinator. They have to call Jim Schwartz. Other teams are going to call Jim Schwartz, I'm telling you that, if that haven't already.\"Jones said the Browns would \"try\" to keep Schwartz in the coming days. Schwartz's potential departure could cause a \"ripple effect\" that would include other defensive staffers and players, per ESPN. Despite a 5-12 record, Cleveland finished fourth in the NFL in total defense this season, giving up just 283.6 yards per game. That included Myles Garrett's single-season league record 23 sacks as the featured threat within a feared pass rush.\nThe Browns managed 53 total sacks -- third-highest in the league -- and allowed 167.2 yards passing per game, second-best in the AFC behind the Buffalo Bills. Schwartz's defenses have been routinely put in bad situations in Cleveland by an underperforming offense. After a five-year run with the Philadelphia Eagles that included a Super Bowl title in 2018, Schwartz stepped away due to health issues after the 2020 season. He later latched on with the Tennessee Titans as a senior defensive assistant before landing in Cleveland. Schwartz's unit led the NFL in multiple categories, including total defense and passing defense, during his first campaign in 2023.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON --It will be easy to view Gotham's extremely early exit from the Women's Champions Cup as a result out of the blue, an underdog tale with Corinthians as its protagonists. Rerun this game and some of those 21 shots the NWSL champions rained down on Leticia's goal might have found a way through. The delirium that spread from the stands onto the pitch at the final whistle made clear that Corinthians, now 1-0 winners thanks to a Gabi Zanotti 83rd minute counterattack, had agreed with Gotham's pre-match assessment that the Americans had been the favorites.And yet there was nothing flukey to this. This was not a case of minnows sending the top dogs crashing out, but of one side finding the ways to narrow a gap to their opponent that had not been that great to begin with, and then edging this contest in the decisive moment. That came seven minutes from the 90th, one of Corinthians' customarily dangerous counters eluding Jess Carter and finding veteran captain Gabi Zenotti, her low drive punishing Ann-Katherine Berger for drifting out of position.Ultimately this was a game decided by who could exploit the mistakes of the opposition. That shouldn't be a matter of any great surprise, both of these teams were returning to action in the midst of what might otherwise have been their off season. For Gotham this was their first competitive match since beating Washington Spirit to the NWSL Championship on November 22. Corinthians' season had come to an end only a few weeks later with defeats to rivals Palmeiras. Neither side lacked for energy but the sort of automatisms that come several games into a new campaign eluded Gotham in particular.In the second half they were able to get Midge Purce isolated with her full back, but only once, when substitute Katie Stengel cut across her defender, did it result in a clear cut opening. In the first half Gotham found it easy enough to progress through the Corinthians lines, but without really manufacturing the high volume of penalty box touches that might result in good quality shots. The final count of 21 looks impressive, but only twice did they draw a save from Leticia in the Corinthians goal.\nTheir best chance of the game was not one of those. A loose pass from Leticia was stolen by Jaedyn Shaw and sat up nicely for Savannah McCaskill, but her swing at the ball flew wide of the target. It might have been that moment that Juan Carlos Amoros had in mind when he ruefully noted post-match that \"football is about goals, if you don't score them you get punished.\"While it was easy to agree with that it was not quite as obvious that Amoros was right when he attested that Gotham had controlled the game. If they did, they certainly did not translate it into enough. You couldn't argue against the NWSL side's dominance of possession, they had around 65% of the ball after all, but this still felt like a game that was happening to them. Solid in their mid-block, waiting to spring the outstanding Jaqueline on the counter, Corinthians seemed to have the game where they wanted it.\"We knew we had to change a little bit,\" said Luca Piccinato. \"We like to always have the ball. We like to be in possession. This is one of our targets, but I think we were able to control well and actually finish better. We knew when we were in possession we would be able to find the best moment to win.\n\"We were a little bit scared to begin with, but then we stabilized the game. We planned to be aggressive in certain moments. We know in a  match like this we have to adapt.\"Perhaps it is easier to make those adaptations when it feels like you are at home and on this Wednesday lunchtime, a slice of west London had the feel of Sao Paulo in every way bar one. It really would have been nice if Corinthians could have brought the weather with them from Brazil, but instead they drew \"unbelievable\" support, the Brentford Community Stadium bouncing to the poroporo before a ball had been kicked.\nNinety minutes and change later and the Corinthians players hurled themselves into a jubilant North Stand, the exceptional Gi Fernandes stood on the advertising hoardings, arms spread aloft in triumph, basking in an adulation that was intermingled with incredulity. This is Brazil and this is what Brazilian clubs, men's or women's, do on the intercontinental stage. The much-vaunted NWSL-WSL face off in a final will have to wait.\n\"Nobody wins before the game but everyone was talking about Gotham and Arsenal in the final,\" said Piccinato, whose six time Copa Libertadores winners are not going to settle for second place. \"We want to leave England with this title. I believe that with more time, we had to adjust, we think we'll have quite a few possibilities in terms of our planning.\"In the final we are going to have to play a little better in the transition. Playing against a big team like Gotham made us put the block closer to our area, there were some spaces in open areas we can improve. We are going to focus a bit more in this area.\"What they deployed in that area was still enough to threaten Gotham all the way through and perhaps that shouldn't have been as much of a shock as it felt in the moment. After all, Opta's power rankings might place the NWSL champions as the 11th best club in the sport and Corinthians the 39th, but the gap in team rating is hardly a chasm. Indeed those rankings place the Brazilians either side of Boston Legacy and Angel City. If Corinthians could draw Gotham into the right sort of game, this was always on the cards.\n\"We were aware [of how Corinthians might play],\" said Amoros. \"Football is played in different ways around the world, and we know that in this, you know, this kind of game is very different to the American league. I think it's just the way it is, everywhere is different. That's the beauty of the game.\"So too were the celebrations that engulfed Corinthians at the final whistle. It might be on to the next one for the champions of South America but whatever the outcome of Sunday's final, this remarkable show of strength will not soon be forgotten.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Browns' coaching search is finally over. The team is hiring former Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken as its new head coach, per CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones.Monken, who will turn 60 on Feb. 5, worked as John Harbaugh's play-caller in Baltimore from 2023 to 2025, and he'll return to Cleveland after serving as the Browns' offensive coordinator in 2019. Monken will become the eighth non-interim head coach in NFL history to coach his first game at age 60 or older, per CBS Sports Research. He'll join Bud Wilkinson (1978), Rod Rust (1990), Dick MacPherson (1991), Dick LeBeau (2000), Bruce Arians (2013), Vic Fangio (2019) and David Culley (2021).Monken takes over in Cleveland after three candidates -- Mike McDaniel, Jesse Minter and Grant Udinski -- pulled out of contention for the Browns' opening. He reportedly had an opportunity to become the New York Giants' offensive coordinator under Harbaugh, but he'll instead be the latest new AFC North head coach, joining Mike McCarthy (Pittsburgh Steelers) and Jesse Minter (Baltimore Ravens).So what are the pros and cons of hiring the former two-time national championship-winning offensive coordinator at Georgia and Harbaugh's most recent OC in Baltimore? Let's dig into the move with two pros and cons.\n📈 Helped Lamar Jackson reach another levelThe Browns have the most intriguing quarterback room in football, with Deshaun Watson and newly minted Pro Bowler Shedeur Sanders, the fifth-round pick and Deion's son who just finished his rookie season.Watson has just one year left on his five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, and his Cleveland tenure has been a disaster. He has played only 19 games in four seasons since the Browns traded three first-round picks for him, and he has registered zero 300-yard passing games with the franchise. His 2023 season ended abruptly due to a shoulder injury, and he tore his Achilles in Week 7 of the 2024 season -- then suffered a setback during the rehab process.\nSanders, meanwhile, threw more interceptions (10) than touchdowns (seven), and his 56.6% completion rate ranked as the second-worst in the league from his debut in Week 11 through the end of the season. He also developed a habit of holding the ball too long, often creating his own pressure. Sanders' average time to throw of 3.4 seconds was the longest in the NFL from Weeks 11-18, which helps explain why he was the league's most pressured quarterback, facing a 51% pressure rate despite being blitzed at the seventh-lowest rate (24%).\nMonken might be the coach who can coax closer to league-average play out of Sanders. Jackson earned 2023 NFL MVP honors in his first season with Monken and arguably should have won again in 2024. That year, Jackson became the first player in NFL history to hit the following benchmarks:First QB with 4,000-plus passing yards and 800-plus rushing yardsFirst QB with 40-plus passing touchdowns and 600-plus rushing yardsFirst QB with 40-plus passing touchdowns and fewer than five interceptionsSanders likely won't reach a level even close to that, but either he -- or the next quarterback Cleveland drafts -- could develop nicely under Monken.\n        \n            \n                NFL coaching grades are in: Bills make lukewarm hire with Joe Brady while Harbaugh, Minter lead the class\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n📉 Forgot Derrick Henry was his RB at times this season\nRavens five-time Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry had another monster season in 2025. He finished as the league's second-leading rusher with 1,595 yards, and he has now produced 1,500-plus rushing yards, 5-plus yards per carry and 15-plus rushing touchdowns in both of his seasons with Baltimore.\nHowever, there were times Monken seemed to forget he had one of the best running backs of this generation at his disposal. After Henry scored on a 2-yard touchdown run to put the Ravens up 24-13 over the New England Patriots in Week 16, Monken didn't dial up a single touch for him the rest of the game. Baltimore ended up losing 28-24.Henry had five games with fewer than 15 carries, which is a red flag. The Ravens missed the playoffs by one game, and Henry's inconsistent usage contributed to their failure to win the 2025 AFC North title.Cleveland will be hoping Monken can maximize second-year running back Quinshon Judkins, whose 827 rushing yards were the sixth-most by a rookie in Browns history.\n📈 Gained valuable leadership experience under HarbaughMonken went 13-25 in three seasons as a college head coach at Southern Miss from 2013 to 2015, which isn't exactly inspiring. It's worth noting, though, that he went 9-5 in his final season.After spending the past three years with the Ravens as John Harbaugh's offensive coordinator, perhaps he has a new approach to leadership as a head coach. And there aren't many better \"leaders of men\" in the NFL than the former Super Bowl champion, who is now the head coach of the Giants.📉 Faces a shaky historical precedentOf the seven previous non-interim, first-time NFL head coaches who were hired at age 60 or older, only one lasted longer than three seasons: Bruce Arians with the Arizona Cardinals and later the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The other six lasted one, two or three seasons at most.\nBy historical precedent, Monken's hire could have a short-term shelf life, meaning Cleveland might be conducting another coaching search sooner rather than later.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When USC squandered a 10-point lead and suffered a 30-27 overtime loss to TCU in the Alamo Bowl, it was only fitting that a defensive breakdown allowed the Horned Frogs to score the decisive touchdown. For a Trojans program that so often in the Lincoln Riley era has been limited by its defense, watching Jeremy Payne evade multiple tacklers along the sideline and rattle off a 35-yard, walk-off score was eerily familiar and a sign that there still remains work to be done in constructing a championship-caliber operation.Enter Gary Patterson.Weeks after losing to TCU, Riley identified a program legend and 2026 College Football Hall of Fame electee as his next defensive coordinator. The longtime Horned Frogs coach will take over for D'Anton Lynn, who departed from USC to take the same job at his alma mater, Penn State.Riley said after the Alamo Bowl that the hiring pool for his defensive coordinator position was robust. Assistant coaching hires, he said, have become easier in recent seasons with USC upgrading its talent and strengthening its alignment from the administrative level down through the coaching staff and recruiting personnel. At face value, the Patterson hire backs up that claim.\"I think for us right now the opportunity to make a hire, to continue to make us better and to go from being a very good defense to being a great defense is the goal,\" Riley said. \"We have the personnel to do it. We're on an upward trend.\"\nPatterson became the winningest coach in TCU history with his defenses regularly standing in the upper half of the country. The 2010 Horned Frogs unit led the nation in scoring prevention en route to an undefeated season, capping a six-year run in which the team ranked inside the top 15 in points allowed per game. His 2014 unit ranked eighth in keeping opponents off the board and nearly earned a berth in the inaugural College Football Playoff.What remains to be seen is whether Patterson's defensive acumen will translate to the modern Big Ten and how much of an impact, if any, his five-year absence from full-time coaching will make.USC could not afford to whiff on Lynn's successor. The Trojans offense will always be among the best in the Big Ten, if not the country, as long as Riley is its orchestrator. The defense has to hold up its end of the bargain, or else this dormant championship contender will never find its elusive breakthrough. Lynn helped the Trojans make significant strides on his side of the ball over a two-year tenure, and the 2025 defense allowed fewer points per game (23) than any of the groups that preceded it in the Riley era.\nThe standard is improving, and Patterson needs to elevate it further.\n        \n            \n                College football teams hurt most by 2026 NFL Draft early entries: Ohio State, Indiana must reload\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUSC trends upward despite defensive coordinator changeWhile the Trojans lost some momentum heading into the offseason, they still ought to feel optimistic about the long-term direction of their squad. Riley worked tirelessly over the last four years to build something sustainable at a program in search of returning to its pedestal as a perennial national championship hopeful. He said after bowl season that the pieces are beginning to fall into place for USC to make a push in 2026 and beyond.\"This place is doing all the things that you need to do to put yourself in position to go bust that door down and do it,\" Riley said. \"I really believe a window here has opened up that's taken a lot of effort by a lot of people, a lot of commitment by a lot of people. Four fun, but really challenging years to get it open, and it's open now.\"Those efforts most notably included a shift in focus on the recruiting trail and the building of alignment between the program, the athletic department and university administration. Riley has not been bashful this year in discussing those steps forward. So while USC remains in search of its first College Football Playoff berth, posted a losing record against top-25 teams this season and closed the campaign with two losses in its final three games, the best still may be yet to come for Riley in what has thus far been an underwhelming tenure.\nTrojans welcome top-ranked recruiting classWhen Riley took the USC job in 2022, he constructed his roster mostly through the transfer portal. It was a fruitful approach that produced an 11-win season and a Heisman Trophy, but it was not a model for sustainable success. Riley recognized that reality and altered his recruiting approach, instead working to load up on elite high school recruits and keep the state of California's best prospects close to home.The philosophy change paid dividends. USC signed 247Sports' No. 1-ranked recruiting class during the 2026 cycle and became the first non-SEC team to do so since 2008. Nine of the nation's top 100 prospects signed with the Trojans, including class headliner Keenyi Pepe, the No. 1 offensive tackle and No. 5 overall player in America.Recent national champions proved that while the transfer portal is a helpful tool, winning at the highest level still requires the stacking of loaded high school classes. USC took the first step in that regard over the last year, and its prized newcomers will debut on the practice field this spring.\nJayden Maiava returns amid supporting cast turnoverWhile one of the nation's best one-two punches at the wide receiver position is gone, USC may avoid offensive regression in 2026 with quarterback Jayden Maiava set to return for his senior season. He will have to build new reliable connections with Biletnikoff Award winner Makai Lemon and matchup nightmare Ja'Kobi Lane departing to pursue NFL careers.Getting young running back Waymond Jordan back and healthy after his ankle tightrope surgery should take pressure off Maiava. King Miller will round out a dynamic backfield after breaking out in Jordan's absence.Perhaps freshman Tanook Hines will emerge as the next great USC receiver as he enters his second year in the offense. Maiava linked up with Hines 34 times for 561 yards and two touchdowns in their first season together.\n            ",

Arne Slot has had a tough job following up on Liverpool's Premier League title-winning charge of last season, but no one expected the Reds to be 14 points off league leaders Arsenal and currently out of a Champions League place due to going winless in their last five Premier League matches. But to their credit, that malaise hasn't translated to European play. In that competition, Liverpool are coming off an impressive victory over Olympique Marseille that saw Mohamed Salah make his return to the squad in a shutout victory.How to watch Liverpool vs. Qarabag, oddsDate: Wednesday, Jan. 27 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool. England Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Liverpool -1000; Draw +900; Qarabag +2200Returning home to Anfield, they can keep that momentum going if they're able to secure a top eight place in the league phase, which would give the Reds an automatic berth into the last 16 of the Champions League. Despite their struggles recently, Liverpool have been unbeaten at home in their last six matches, and all they need is a victory over Qarabag to get the job done. With how many games teams at the top levels of soccer need to play in a given season, anything that would save the Reds a couple matches down the road will go a long way, but that doesn't mean that the Azerbaijani side will be an easy out in this competition.Among the surprise sides so far, Qarabag are in 18th in the league phase, as one of the surprises of the tournament so far. Coming into this campaign, they had never secured a Champions League win in their history, but here they are on the cusp of making the knockouts with only Liverpool in their path. Because of this, the Reds will need to make sure that they don't take this match for granted despite being heavy favorites. The defense has been susceptible, with only two clean sheets in their last five matches and Qarabag have been excellent on the counter attack. Even if the Reds go up early in the match, no team have won more points from losing positions than Qarabag. Along with Barcelona, they've picked up seven points when going behind.\nThis will put pressure on Florian Wirtz and Mohamed Salah to push the attack forward while Virgil Van Dijk looks to steady the defense. Like many of the matches on the final day of league phase action, this is one which could be very open but a track meet will certinaly favor the Reds.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        It's been unusually quiet for the NBA trade deadline to be just eight days away, but that likely means we're in store for a bunch of chaos as we get closer to Feb. 5. The big move everyone is waiting on is seeing if Giannis Antetokounmpo gets traded by the Milwaukee Bucks, which could be a real possibility after the latest news that came out on Wednesday.There's only a few teams that can truly give the Bucks a worthy package for the two-time MVP right now, but other teams around the league are trying to improve in smaller, significant ways. We'll see if any splashy moves actually happen, but until then let's take a look at the trade rumor landscape and see what's worth paying attention to.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Giannis finally open to trade, and the Bucks are obligingIt's not quite a Giannis trade, but it's the closest we've come to suggest the biggest potential blockbuster of this trade deadline may happen. ESPN's Shams Charania is reporting that Giannis Antetokounmpo is \"ready for a new home\" either before the Feb. 5 deadline, or this summer, and the Bucks are starting to listen to trade offers.This is a complete 180 from a few weeks ago, when the Bucks were rebuffing trade talks, and Antetokounmpo has maintained that he would not outright request a trade request. But consider this a soft launch to see how people react to the news.\nAntetokounmpo has reportedly been informing the Bucks for months that trading him is the best path forward, and now that may be coming to fruition.Marc Stein has reported that the Miami Heat are a team to watch for an Antetokounmpo trade at the deadline. A package could be centered around Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware and draft picks per Stein. That's not a shabby return, but the Bucks, per Charania, are communicating to teams that they're not in a rush to trade him before the deadline.Instead, Milwaukee could wait until the summer if a deal doesn't materialize that nets them a high-end prospect and several draft picks. Given that more teams will be able to offer better packages in the offseason, waiting for the summer might be the better option.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Lakers interested in Marshall, DiVincenzo, othersThe Lakers will be buyers at the deadline, as they try to improve enough to be legitimate contenders this season. L.A. could certainly use a better big man than what the duo of Deandre Ayton and Jaxon Hayes provides them, but they're also on the hunt to improve on the perimeter too.Los Angeles Times writer Broderick Turner is reporting that the Lakers hold some interest in a wide array of wing players as the deadline approaches. That includes Naji Marshall, Donte DiVincenzo, Keon Ellis, De'Andre Hunter, Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III.So basically every coveted role player on the market. It's unclear how available some of these players are, as the Pelicans said both Jones and Murphy are untouchable. Marshall has garnered some interest around the league, especially since he's been on a tear since the new year, averaging 18.3 points on 56% from the floor. But it would be shocking to see the Mavericks make a deal with the Lakers so close to the anniversary of the Luka Dončić trade, a deal so poorly received on every level that it caused a revolt within their own fanbase and led to the firing of the man to championed the deal just nine months after it happened.\nAs far as everyone else on this list, it will come down to how valuable other teams view L.A.'s tradable players, which will primarily consist of Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht. Something's telling me that probably won't net the Lakers a player they're really wanting in return, but who knows.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cavaliers open to reunion with LeBronCould the kid from Akron be coming home? Everyone is wondering what James' future will hold. Will he be traded at the deadline? Will he retire this summer? Will he stay with the Lakers on another short-term deal? Will be sign elsewhere for a farewell tour?If this were a movie, James would sign with the Cavaliers for one final season before he retires, and apparently Cleveland would \"welcome\" that idea, per ESPN's Dave McMenamin.\nThere's no telling if the feeling is mutual for James, who will be a free agent in the summer, but what we do know about the first-ballot Hall of Famer is he loves to put on a show. Imagine how much attention that season would garner in Cleveland. The marketing opportunities, the ticket sales, the feel-good ending. James is a basketball player, but he's also a businessman and that would be a phenomenal business move. And he'd be joining a Cavs team that has a legitimate chance at making the NBA Finals next year. It's almost too perfect a situation. But we'll have to wait and see if that comes to fruition in the offseason, unless the Cavs are open to trading for him now.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pro Football Hall of Fame may as well stitch a \"B\" on every gold jacket it hands out from now until the end of time as a scarlet letter in the aftermath of snubbing Bill Belichick on the first ballot. The bombshell report from ESPN revealing that the legendary head coach, widely considered to be the greatest the NFL has ever seen, was not voted into Canton on the first ballot has rattled the league to its core and has left a permanent stain on the institution. It's bewildering to be in a reality where Belichick is not a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee, but here we are. Because we live in such a reality, we have to now ask this question: Is Tom Brady next? It's an equally ludicrous thought to consider, but the simple fact is that if it can happen to Belichick, it almost certainly can happen to Brady, the co-pillar to New England's dynasty. Brady retired after the 2023 season, meaning he will first be eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2028. But will he actually break through? What was once thought to be the most obvious of locks is no longer so obvious. \"I don't understand it,\" Brady told Seattle Sports on Wednesday when asked to react to Belichick's snub. \"I mean, I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. ... There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach, to go out there to win a Super Bowl, give me one season, I'm taking Bill Belichick.\"\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports HQ\n                                                            Let's look at the reported reasons why Belichick won't be enshrined on the first ballot. The reporting from ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. and Seth Wickersham cites multiple sources that point to New England's pair of cheating scandals -- Spygate and Deflategate -- as key elements as to why Belichick is on the outside looking in. \"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a veteran Hall voter told ESPN on Tuesday. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"As it relates to Spygate, Belichick was fined $500,000, while the team was docked a first-round draft pick and fined $250,000 as well. Brady was quarterbacking the New England Patriots over this period of alleged videotaping, but did not specifically receive any sort of punishment. Deflategate, however, is a different story entirely. Brady was at the center of that scandal and ended up serving a four-game suspension. \nWe won't dive into how credible the NFL's findings were over their investigation, the Ideal Gas Law, or The Wells Report in Context. We're merely pointing out that there is ammunition to dock Brady just like there was with Belichick regarding Spygate. The voters decided to use it against Belichick, and it stands to wonder if they'll use it towards Brady once he becomes eligible. At this stage, they'd look tremendously hypocritical if they don't, which further emphasizes how inexcusable and laughable snubbing Belichick was in the first place.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Count Tom Brady and Robert Kraft among the swarm of prominent football figures to speak out in dismay after longtime New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick fell short of the voting threshold required for Pro Football Hall of Fame induction. Brady, who won six of his seven Super Bowls under Belichick's tutelage, called the snub from first-ballot induction \"completely ridiculous\" and lamented the selection process after his former coach fell short of the required 40 out of 50 votes.Belichick became Hall of Fame-eligible this year because he has not coached in the NFL since 2023. He will be back up for nomination as part of the 2027 class, but that he missed out on joining the illustrious fraternity in his first year on the ballot left the football world puzzled.\"I don't understand it,\" Brady said during a Seattle Sports radio appearance. \"I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Which is completely ridiculous, because people deserve it. He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm taking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl, give me one season, I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"Kraft, the Patriots' owner since 1994, joined Brady in calling into question how Belichick could possibly not make it on his first ballot. Kraft and Belichick ended their tenure working together on icy terms, but Kraft still calls him the \"greatest coach of all time\" and said he should have been a unanimous selection this year.\n\"Whatever perceptions may exist about any personal differences between Bill and me, I strongly believe Bill Belichick's record and body of work speak for themselves,\" Kraft told the Associated Press. \"As head coach of the New England Patriots for more than two decades, he set the standard for on-field excellence, preparation, and sustained success in the free agency and salary cap era of the National Football League. He is the greatest coach of all time and he unequivocally deserves to be a unanimous first-ballot Pro Football Hall of Famer.\"Kraft is also a finalist in the contributor category for the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year, as he hopes to finally get selected after also falling short numerous times due to the various controversies during the Patriots' dynastic run. With Belichick now getting the same treatment, one can't help but wonder if Brady's first time on the ballot will be met with similar resistance. \n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snubbed by Hall of Fame: We now can't rule out the possibility of Tom Brady meeting same fate\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFrom an accolades standpoint, there is no justification for voters excluding Belichick from their ballots. He set a head coaching record with six Super Bowl wins and added two more as an assistant, leads all coaches with 12 Super Bowl appearances, ranks second all time with 333 career wins and holds more playoff victories (31) than any coach in league history.\nBelichick's implication in multiple scandals during his Patriots tenure are essentially the only knocks against his résumé and were enough for multiple voters to pass over him as a first-ballot inductee. One voter said to ESPN that the scandals \"really bothered some of the guys.\"\"When it comes down to votes and popularity and all that, welcome to the world of voting,\" Brady said. \"You may as well go try for the Oscars or whatever and get a big panel to tell you if you're good or not. It's the way it works, unfortunately.\"Only four coaches have been enshrined as first-ballot Hall of Famers since 1970. There has been a movement to keep Belichick out of that group because of Spygate and Deflategate, and enough voters shared the sentiment that he ought to wait a year.\nBelichick will almost certainly get into the Hall next year after paying the price for his controversies. But that he has to wait a year and that his legacy will always be slightly tarnished by his lack of first-ballot status raises questions about the validity of the voting process itself.\"He's going to get into the Hall of Fame,\" Brady said. \"In the end, I'm not worried about that. A lot of times in life, for all of us, things don't happen exactly how you want them on your timeline. But we'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen. He's going to have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything that he did and the commitment that he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives. That will be a great celebration when it happens.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Detroit Pistons kept the good times rolling Tuesday with a dramatic 109-107 victory over the Denver Nuggets, whose furious second-half comeback attempt fell short when Jamal Murray missed three vital free throws down the stretch. But while no one in Detroit was complaining about winning for the ninth time in the last 11 games to push their lead atop the Eastern Conference back to 5 ½ games over the Boston Celtics, Tuesday's contest was yet another reminder that the Pistons need more 3-point shooting. The Pistons went 6 of 31 (19.4%) from 3-point range against the Nuggets, including 0 of 5 in the fourth quarter, which was just the latest in a string of ice-cold performances. Tuesday was not even their worst showing of the season. Over the last two-plus weeks, the Pistons have been under 30% from behind the arc four times. They also went 5 of 26 (19.2%) against the Atlanta Hawks on Dec. 1 and 6 of 33 (18.2%) against the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 18.Of the 697 games played across the league thus far this season, there have been 27 instances of a team taking at least 25 3s and shooting worse than 20%. The Pistons account for three of them. No team has more such outings. \nFor the season, the Pistons are now 27th in the league in 3-point attempts per game (31.9), 20th in 3-point percentage (35%) and 28th in percentage of points scored from 3-point range (28.6%). They don't have a single rotation player shooting at least 40% from 3 and (Duncan Robinson (39.4%), Cade Cunningham (32.6%) and Tobias Harris (33.9%) are the only players taking four or more attempts per game, However you want to slice it, the Pistons are one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in the league, which is a major reason why, despite only being 2 ½ games behind the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder for the second-best record in the league, they are 11th in overall offense (116.1 offensive rating) and have the fourth-best title odds (+1400, per Caesars). Can the Pistons win a title with their lack of shooting?History would say that it's unlikely. Here's a look at where the last 10 champions ranked in the league in 3-point attempts per game and 3-point percentage. \nSeasonTeam3PA / G3P%2024-25Thunder10th6th2023-24Celtics1st2nd2022-23Nuggets25th4th2021-22Warriors3rd8th2020-21Bucks8th5th2019-20Lakers23rd21st2018-19Raptors11th6th2017-18Warriors17th1st2016-17Warriors5th3rd2015-16Cavaliers3rd7thSix of the last 10 champions finished in the top 10 in both 3-point attempts per game and 3-point percentage, while nine finished in the top-eight in 3-point percentage. It's still possible to get away with not taking a ton of 3s, but only if you make the ones you do take at a high rate. Notably, the only team to win a title while being in the bottom-third of the league in both 3-point attempts per game and 3-point percentage was the 2020 Lakers, who had LeBron James and won in the bubble. That's not to take away from their accomplishment, but to emphasize that they were an outlier. What should the Pistons do at the deadline?The Feb. 5 trade deadline is rapidly approaching, and the Pistons are one of the most interesting teams to watch. After making the playoffs last season for the first time since 2019, the front office made a conscious decision in the summer to avoid any big deals. They brought in some veterans to help around the margins, but wanted to give their young core a chance to grow. That plan has worked better than anyone could have expected. The Pistons are cruising to the No. 1 seed in the East, and have a real chance to get back to the Finals for the first time since 2005, and possibly even win their first championship since 2004. So what does the front office do now? Stand pat and let this group gain even more postseason experience? Make a move on the margins to improve the shooting? Or swing for the fences now with a real chance to contend for a title?The Pistons own all of their future first-round picks, and have 14 future second-round picks and a $14.1 million trade exception at their disposal. They also boast an array of young talent and Tobias Harris' $26.6 million expiring contract. In other words, they can find a way to trade for almost any player they want. It does not appear as though they'll make any blockbuster deals in the next week, however. \"You don't need to skip steps and go out and trade for some sort of superstar right away because you never know how that's going to end up for you. Trajan [Langdon] will always make the smart decision and the right decision for the team,\" coach J.B. Bickerstaff told FanDuel TV last month.At the same time, it's hard to imagine the Pistons doing nothing at the deadline. They have a glaring weakness, plenty of assets and are in first place with a real chance to contend. Let's take a look at a few players they could target to improve their shooting. Big swing: Michael Porter Jr.\nPorter Jr. has been phenomenal for the Brooklyn Nets this season. He's averaging 25.2 points and shooting 39.5% on 9.4 3-point attempts per game while taking on a much bigger offensive role than he's ever had in his career. Porter would not only give the Pistons another elite outside shooter, but someone would could take some pressure off of Cunningham, who has had to carry a tremendous offensive burden this season. Chris Mannix reported Tuesday that the Nets are asking for multiple first-round picks for Porter, though that price could go down closer to the deadline. Two firsts would be a steep price to pay, especially for a player with his injury history, but the Pistons have the draft capital to make it happen. Trading for Porter wouldn't force the Pistons to completely mortgage their future, but it would be a big swing and limit their future flexibility. Moderate swing: Coby White\nWhite is putting together another solid season for the middling Chicago Bulls: 19 points and 4.7 assists, while shooting 37% on 7.2 3-point attempts per game. He turned down an extension in the fall, and will be a free agent this summer. It appears unlikely he'll re-sign in Chicago, and according to Marc Stein is the most likely Bulls guard to be dealt before the deadline. White's impending free agent status may put off the Pistons, but it may also lower the Bulls' asking price. While White isn't an elite outside shooter, he's a very good one, especially in catch-and-shoot opportunities (42.9%). He would also give the Pistons another playmaker who could help facilitate the offense when Cunningham is not on the floor. Notably, no one outside of Cunningham is averaging more than 3.4 assists for the Pistons. Moderate swing: Bobby Portis\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's latest calf strain has essentially ended the Milwaukee Bucks' season. Regardless of whether or not he's traded before the deadline, it's now in the Bucks' best interest to tank, which could mean moving veterans like Portis, who has been one of the league's best sixth men in recent years. Portis can be streaky, but he's been a reliable shooter throughout his career and has been incredible this season: 45.8% on 4.2 attempts per game -- good for fourth in the league on the official leaderboard. He would certainly fit the Pistons' overall temperament and also give them a floor-spacing big, which is something the roster lacks. Given his age and contract (two years, $30.1 million remaining after this season), he likely wouldn't command a big price. Small swing: Luke Kennard\nThe Pistons are familiar with Kennard, who spent his first three seasons with the team. If they want to add an elite shooter without giving up any of their primary assets, Kennard would be a clear option. He's shooting a league-leading 49.3% on 3.3 attempts per game for the Hawks this season, and is at 44.1% for his career. Kennard is on an $11 million expiring contract and certainly would not cost much to acquire. The issue with Kennard is that while he would help in the regular season, he might not be able to stay on the floor deep into the playoffs due to his defensive issues. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Patrick Reed has set a return to the PGA Tour after playing out his LIV Golf contract, which expired at the end of 2025. Reed and the PGA Tour announced Wednesday that he has applied for reinstatement as a Tour member for the 2027 season. Reed will compete on the DP World Tour in 2026 as an honorary lifetime member and become eligible to play in PGA Tour events as a non-member beginning Aug. 25, 2026, one year since he last participated in a LIV Golf event. That would clear him to play the FedEx Cup Fall in 2026 through sponsors' invitations or Monday qualifiers, if he so chooses. Having won nine PGA Tour titles, including the 2018 Masters, Reed will have past champion status on the PGA Tour in 2027.He will seek to improve that status and climb the PGA Tour's priority rankings through his performance on the DP World Tour, where he recently won the Hero Dubai Desert Classic to kick off the season. The top 10 finishers in the DP World Tour's Race to Dubai standings who don't already have PGA Tour status gain membership for the following season. \nReed stated on Wednesday why he decided to return to the PGA Tour:  \"After careful thought and consideration, my family and I have decided that I will no longer compete on the LIV Golf Tour. I am excited to announce that I am returning to the PGA Tour as a past champion member for the 2027 season and am eligible to begin competing in PGA Tour events later this year. I will continue to compete and play as an Honorary Lifetime Member on the DP World Tour, which is something that I am truly honored and excited to do. \t\"I'm a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA Tour, which is where my story began with my wife, Justine. I am very fortunate for the opportunities that have come my way and grateful for the life we have created. I am moving forward in my career, and I look forward to competing on the PGA Tour and DP World Tour. I can't wait to get back out there and revisit some of the best places on earth.\" \tReed joins Brooks Koepka as the second player to leave LIV Golf and return to the PGA Tour; however, Reed is not being offered the same quick path back to playing that Koepka was granted under the unique setup of the Returning Member Program. Koepka makes his PGA Tour return this week at the Farmers Insurance Open after being fast-tracked back by the Tour, but Reed did not meet the same criteria as Koepka as a recent major champion.  \nThe PGA Tour noted that Reed's reinstatement for 2027 is allowed because he resigned his membership in 2022 prior to leaving for LIV Golf; therefore, he did not violate any PGA Tour regulations. He will remain ineligible for participation in the Player Equity Program through 2030 as part of the conditions of his return, much like Koepka.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Browns hired former Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken as their next head coach, they announced. Monken spent the last three seasons as John Harbaugh's play-caller with the Ravens and previously worked as Cleveland's OC in 2019.The Browns fired Kevin Stefanski at the end of the season, but retained general manager Andrew Berry, who was a leading voice in drafting quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. Monken will work with both quarterbacks along with making a decision on Deshaun Watson ahead of the 2026 season.Monken was also in the mix to land the New York Giants' OC vacancy, forcing Harbaugh to look elsewhere. Three coaches — Mike McDaniel, Jesse Minter and Grant Udinski — all pulled out of Cleveland's search as targets with Monken, Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase and Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz being the eventual finalists.  Cleveland's new hire is part of a mass restructuring within the AFC North, which including Pittsburgh hiring Mike McCarthy to replace Mike Tomlin and the Ravens hiring Minter to as Harbaugh's replacement.\nMonken served under Kirby Smart as Georgia's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2020-22, winning a pair of national titles. He orchestrated a balanced attack led by Stetson Bennett at quarterback and parlayed that rise into a return to the NFL with the Ravens in 2023. At Georgia, the Bulldogs were 37-3 overall during Monken's tenure.Quarterback will quickly fall under the microscope during Monken's tenure. Sanders went 3-4 as the starter this season, and completed 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions in eight total games played. He became the first Browns quarterback to win his first career start since 1995 and despite struggles with efficiency in his first season, is reportedly a Pro Bowl honoree. During his previous one-year stint in Cleveland, Monken helped the Browns generate a strong rushing attack behind Nick Chubb in 2019. Chubb rushed for 1,494 yards, the second-highest total in the NFL that season.\nThe Browns finished 6-10 with Monken as offensive coordinator and fired Freddie Kitchens as coach. Monken's resurgence with the Ravens featured two of the league's highest-scoring offenses his first two years behind Derrick Henry and Jackson. During the 2024 season, Baltimore led the league in total offense and rushing offense.\n            ",

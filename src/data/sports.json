The Eagles, who are defending Super Bowl champions, could've been the No. 2 seed if they won in Week 18 but chose to rest their starters instead and are now the No. 3 seed.

    "body": "\nHere's a stat for you: The 2025 New England Patriots had the easiest schedule since the 1999 St. Louis Rams. But the Patriots don't care if you think that their turnaround season and 14-3 record were the byproduct of playing nobodies; those Rams parlayed that schedule into a Super Bowl title, and New England plans to do the same.On Sunday, the Patriots will get a chance to quiet their critics when the team squares off against the Los Angeles Chargers (11-6) in a NFL Super Wild Card Weekend matchup on Sunday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The winner will advance to an AFC Divisional Round game next week.Both New England and Los Angeles are seeking their first playoff win since the 2018 season. In addition both quarterbacks -- the Patriots' Drake Maye and the Chargers' Justin Herbert -- are looking to earn their first career playoff victories. Maye is making his postseason debut, while Herbert is 0-for-2 in his playoff appearances.New England is a 3.5-point favorite over Los Angeles at DraftKings.Patriots vs. Chargers odds\nOpening spread: Patriots -3.5 (-110)Opening money line: Patriots -180, Chargers +150Opening total: 44.5This line has remained steady at this number since opening at New England -3.5. This will be the fifth time in the last six games with Los Angeles as the underdog. The Chargers went 3-1 both against-the-spread and straight-up in those previous four contests. Meanwhile the Patriots are 4-1 both ATS and straight-up over their last five games. The last time these teams met came in Week 17 of the 2024 season, also in Foxborough. Los Angeles was a six-point favorite that day and won 40-7.However, there has been some movement on the total, which has risen slightly from its initial offering. Over bettors may be taking into account that New England has scored at least 24 points in 12 straight games.Patriots betting profile\nOpening win total: 7.5 wins  W/L record: 14-3ATS record: 12-5O/U record: 11-6Believers in the Patriots had many positive moments in 2025. New England's 12-5 record against-the-spread during the regular season was tied for the best such record in the league. The Patriots also soared over their preseason win total, earning their eighth win in Week 10. In addition, the Over has hit in each of New England's last five games.On Sunday, the Patriots will face a Los Angeles offense that has struggled to protect Herbert. Playing without their starting offensive tackles for much of the year, the Chargers allowed a franchise-worst 60 sacks this season, which is the fifth-most by any team that's ever reached the playoffs. In addition, Herbert has famously struggled in the postseason. He is 0-2 in his playoff career, including a 32-12 loss last year to the Texans in which he competed just 14-of-32 passes for 242 yards and four interceptions with only one touchdown pass.Chargers betting profile\nOpening win total: 9.5 winsW/L record: 11-6ATS record: 9-8O/U record: 7-10The Chargers are 4-2 both ATS and straight-up in their last six games, but remember that coach Jim Harbaugh sat several key starters in the regular season finale against the Broncos. Los Angeles is 4-0 straight-up all-time as an underdog in the Wild Card round, but the last one of those victories came in the 2018 season. The Under has cashed in four of team's last five games, and Under bettors will like that the total has crept up since its opening. While the Chargers have been notorious for giving up sacks this season, New England hasn't been a high-sack defense. The Patriots have registered just 35 sacks this season; just six teams have had fewer. In addition, New England is largely unproven against quality teams. The Patriots are just 1-2 this season against teams that finished with a winning record. That lone victory came in Week 5 against the Bills.Patriots-Chargers prop pick: Hunter Henry Over 41.5 total receiving yards\nLos Angeles' defense has few weaknesses, but one area that Maye and the Patriots may be able to exploit is the Chargers' woes when covering tight ends. Los Angeles allows a passer rating of 111.6 when quarterbacks throw to tight ends. That ranks 24th in the entire NFL and bodes well for New England tight end Hunter Henry. The 6-foot-5, 249-pound threat has gone Over 41.5 receiving yards in nine of 17 games this season, including five of the last seven games. He leads the team in receiving touchdowns (seven) and ranks second behind only Stefon Diggs in targets (87), receptions (60) and receiving yards (768). He could have a big day if Maye emphasizes short and intermediate routes in his postseason debut.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs roll on Sunday with three more games -- Jaguars vs. Bills (+1.5), 49ers vs. Eagles (-6) and Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5). A majority of the daily Fantasy football action will take all three games into account for the 'main slate.' It's a smaller NFL DFS player pool on Sunday than the regular season, but larger than Saturday and Monday during Wild Card Weekend, so there are some tougher calls to make for NFL DFS lineups.How should you value big names like Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, Christian McCaffrey, James Cook and Justin Herbert, and who are the NFL DFS picks who can be sleepers for this slate? Before making any Sunday NFL DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Hurts as an anytime TD scorer (+105) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Wild Card Sunday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Wild Card SundayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Sunday is Eagles running back Saquon Barkley at $8,500 on FanDuel and $7,000 on DraftKings. Barkley had an epic playoff run last year, leading the NFL with 499 rushing yards as he averaged 124.8 yards on the ground over the course of four games. That effort was highlighted by a 205-yard game against the Rams. The Niners were below average defending running backs this season, giving up the 19th-most Fantasy points to opposing backs. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Barkley to go Over 82.5 rushing yards at DraftKings Sportsbook:\nMcClure is also building around Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid ($3,800 on DraftKings, $5,100 on FanDuel), who gets a very favorable matchup against the Jags, a team that has allowed the 22nd-most points to opposing tight ends. With injuries playing a factor, Kincaid's total targets and receptions have been down a bit this season, but he's been more efficient than ever. He averaged a cater-high 14.6 yards per catch and scored a career-high five touchdowns this season. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Kincaid to go Over 41.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Wild Card Sunday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Sunday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

The third round has had a bit of everything so far, with four games going to penalties to determine a winner, and plenty of matches have seen goals galore. Let's take a look at what has happened in the FA Cup so far:FA Cup third round scoresMK Dons 1, Oxford United 1 (Oxford United advance 4-3 on penalties)Preston North End 0, Wigan Athletic 1Wrexham 3, Nottingham Forest 3 (Wrexham advance 4-3 on penalties)Port Vale 1, Fleetwood Town 0Macclesfield 2, Crystal Palace 1Everton 1, Sunderland 1 (Sunderland Advance 3-0 on penalties)Wolverhampton 6, Shrewsbury Town 1Cheltenham 0, Leicester City 2Doncaster Rovers 2, Southampton 3Stoke City 1, Coventry City 0Sheffield Wednesday 0, Brentford 2Newcastle United 3, Bournemouth 3 (Newcastle advance 7-6 on penalties)Fulham 3, Middlesbrough 1Ipswich Town 2, Blackpool 1Manchester City 10, Exeter City 1Burnley 5, Millwall 1Boreham Wood 0, Burton Albion 5Cambridge United 2, Birmingham City 3Tottenham 1, Aston Villa 2Grimbsby Town 3, Weston-super-Mare 2Bristol City 5, Watford 1Charlton 1, Chelsea 5A cupset for the agesThe magic of the FA Cup is always in full swing, but Saturday brought something special even by FA Cup standards. Non-league Macclesfield, who are 117 places below Crystal Palace, became the first non-league team to knock out the FA Cup holders since Palace did it themselves, knocking out Wolverhampton in the 1908-09 first round. Macclesfield are led by John Rooney, the younger brother of Wayne Rooney, and they took control of the match, scoring twice by the 60th minute of play. It's one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history as Macclesfield will now go into the fourth round of play to see if they can keep this run going. Wayne Rooney was there doing coverage for the BBC and could be seen on the verge of tears seeing his brother accomplish history, and they shared an embrace following the match. Man City reach double digit goalsFacing Exeter City at home, Manchester City were expected to roll, but no one expected the show that came to the Etihad. Young defender Max Alleyne was just recalled from a loan to Watford due to an injury to Ruben Dias, and he only needed 12 minutes to find the back of the net for the first of many goals to come for Manchester City. They'd score four just in the first half alone before Antoine Semenyo scored the first goal of his City career in the second half of play. Rico Lewis netted a brace, and somehow, despite Erling Haaland starting the match, he didn't register a goal involvement. Looking at outfielders to start for Pep Guardiola's side, only three didn't have goal involvements during the match, as nearly everyone was involved in this FA Cup domination made an impact. Tottenham's woes continue Thomas Frank is under pressure in his first season as manager of Tottenham, and getting knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa won't do much to ease that. Tottenham have now failed to win in four consecutive matches, and extending things further, they've only won three matches out of their last 10 in all competitions. With Mohammed Kudus being the latest star sidelined for the club, it's becoming even harder for the attack to make things happen. Dominic Solanke's return to the squad could be a help to Frank's side, but they need more from the transfer market as the midfield is not good enough to keep up with a side marching toward the knockout stage of the Champions League. \nLiam Rosenior's first Chelsea winFacing a Championship side, it was expected for Chelsea to roll, and they did just that, defeating Charlton 5-1 on Saturday. It was the first game on the bench for new coach Liam Rosenior, and while they were playing a side a division below them, Chelsea controlled things from start to finish, only allowing six shots, with two of those being on target. The Blues held 74 percent of the possession, and Jorrel Hato opened the scoring in stoppage time of the first half before Chelsea scored four in the second half. With an EFL Cup semifinal on the horizon against Arsenal on Wednesday, this is a good chance for Rosenior to get that win out of the way before the level of difficulty increases for his side quickly in upcoming matches. Sunday's scheduleAll times Eastern\nDerby vs. Leeds, 7 a.m. Portsmouth vs. Arsenal, 9 a.m.Swansea City vs. West Brom, 9:30 a.m.West Ham vs. QPR, 9:30 a.m.Sheffield United vs.Mansfield Town, 9:30 a.m.Norwich vs. Walsall, 9:30 a.m.Hull vs. Blackburn, 9:30 a.m.Man United vs. Brighton, 11:30 a.m.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

This year's postseason won't have Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs or Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, but there will still be plenty of familiar faces. The Eagles are in the playoffs for the fifth straight season and they'll be looking to become the first NFC team in 31 years to repeat as Super Bowl champion. Jalen Hurts is one of just two quarterbacks in the playoffs this year who has won a Super Bowl along with Matthew Stafford and Aaron Rodgers. The Steelers quarterback actually has more career playoff wins than every other QB in the AFC playoff field combined. There are also plenty of new faces in the postseason this year, including six teams that didn't make the playoffs last year with the Seahawks, 49ers, Panthers, Bears, Patriots and Jaguars all getting in.

    "body": "\n        Wisconsin pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the college basketball season with a 91-88 road win over No. 2 Michigan on Saturday in Ann Arbor. The Badgers entered this game as 19-point underdogs against the Wolverines, but  handed Dusty May's squad its first loss of the 2025-26 campaign.The Badgers (11-5, 3-2 Big Ten) trailed by as many as 14 points in the first half. Wisconsin trailed 38-37 at halftime but opened the second half red hot from the floor. The Badgers made their first nine shots, including seven consecutive 3-pointers, before their first miss. The Badgers' 15 3-pointers tied a season-high.John Blackwell had 26 points to lead the Badgers  to their first win vs. at ranked No. 1 or No. 2 on the road for first time since 2016.Michigan (14-1, 4-1) entered the weekend as one of six unbeaten teams in Division I basketball. Nebraska, the other undefeated team from the Big Ten, staged a comeback win over Indiana earlier in the day to improve to 16-0. Nebraska and Purdue are the only teams from the Big Ten without a loss in conference play.\nWisconsin was previously 0-3 against ranked teams this season, with the average margin of defeat being 24.7 points. Entering the week, AP top-five teams were 54-0 against unranked teams this season.Michigan was also 41-0 all-time at home against unranked opponents when ranked in the top two of the AP poll. The Wolverines had the sixth-longest active win streak (14) entering the weekend. In Michigan's last outing, the Wolverines survived an upset scare against Penn State and escaped with a 74-72 win.Wisconsin adds a signature winEntering the weekend, Wisconsin was 0-3 against ranked opponents this season. The Badgers had losses on their resume to BYU, Nebraska, and Purdue. All three of those teams are ranked inside the top-10 of the latest AP poll. Wisconsin had lost five consecutive matchups against ranked teams, with its last win coming against Michigan State in the Big Ten Tournament.\nAdditionally, Wisconsin was just 1-4 entering the weekend when playing away from home, while posting a 9-1 home record.The (early) NCAA Tournament implications were also on display. Per CBS Sports' Bracketology, Wisconsin went from outside the field to a No. 8 seed with its upset win over Michigan. With the loss, the Wolverines dropped from the No. 1 overall seed to a No. 2 seed.\nWhat went wrong for Michigan?Michigan was playing with fire after nearly being upset by Penn State earlier this week. The Nittany Lions had a chance to win the game with no time remaining, but the (what would've been) the game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer was missed. Eleven of Michigan's 14 wins this season came by double-digits. Before this week, Michigan's last win by single digits came against TCU back in November, when the Wolverines escaped with a 67-63 victory.\nAfter that game, Michigan went on a tear. The Wolverines won their next six games by at least 20 points, which included wins over San Diego State, Auburn and Gonzaga. Michigan also defeated No. 24 USC 96-66 at home before nearly losing to Penn State on the road.The difference in this loss was shooting. Wisconsin finished 15 of 33 (45.5%) from the 3-point line. The number of makes (15) tied a season-high, while the shooting percentage was the best the Badgers have shot all season. Michigan finished just 8 of 25 (32%) from the 3-point line. Wisconsin started the second half by making its first seven 3-pointers. That allowed the Badgers to play with a lead throughout the second half. For context, Michigan had trailed at home for just under six minutes the entire season. Wisconsin led for 12:22 of game time, most of which occurred in the second half.\nPoll implications after another undefeated goes downAnd then there were five.Michigan entered the weekend as one of six undefeated teams in college basketball. With the Wolverines' loss to Wisconsin, that number has been reduced to five: Vanderbilt, Miami (Ohio), Nebraska, Iowa State and Arizona.The AP Top 25 poll released earlier this week nearly featured a unique distinction that hadn't been seen since 1981. That's because the one-point difference between Arizona and Michigan kept the poll from becoming the second-ever tie for the No. 1 spot. The last and only time that happened was when Oregon State and Virginia shared the top spot 55 years ago. Arizona has been ranked No. 1 during the last four polls and received 32 first-place votes this past week, while Michigan earned 29. \nThe poll on Monday should look different. If Arizona takes care of business against TCU later in the day, the Wildcats should receive a majority of the first-place votes. Iowa State could also get some extra love next week after receiving zero first-place votes earlier this week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook lists Morikawa and Matsuyma at +1700, with Spieth at +4000. The favorites are Russell Henley at +1100 and Ben Griffin at +1300. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Russell Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a 19-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

    "body": "\n        Is this just how it's going to be with Kansas? Another day, another Darryn Peterson heater. Another day, another Peterson exit in closing time to get the hot pads onto his uncooperative legs. Another day, another loss for a No. 22 Kansas club that is a miraculous last-minute rally against TCU away from having an unfathomable 0-3 record in Big 12 play. This time, it was West Virginia who used a remarkable 16-0 second-half run to give first-year coach Ross Hodge the first true signature win of his tenure. Brenen Lorient (18 points) took care of the first half, and Honor Huff (23 points) handled the second half in WVU's 86-75 victory.It's a Saturday Funday in the country roads, but the story is an all-too-familiar trend that keeps rearing its ugly head with Peterson and Kansas. The potential No. 1 pick has still not been able to start and finish a game. He sat for all but 53 seconds of the final six-plus minutes of regulation. Part of that was certainly tied to fouling Huff while the West Virginia guard was splashing a trey, but Peterson clearly was feeling under the weather.When he was on the floor, Peterson continued to make a hard game look incredibly easy, posting 23 points in 31 minutes. Peterson is up to 158 points in 190 minutes this season. It's one of the most absurd stats of the year, and the connection between Peterson and Melvin Council Jr. looked much more vibrant. Too often this year, Council and Peterson were an either-or dilemma. For long chunks on Saturday, Kansas was getting positive contributions from both of its best guards.\nBut after dropping to 11-5 overall, it's hard to keep Kansas in the top shelf of the Big 12 behemoths, largely because its best player is still not 100% and this defense has been shredded by UCF, TCU and now West Virginia. WVU's offense posted a sizzling 1.28 points per possession, easily the best it's ever managed against a high-major team this season.Pittsburgh: 1.12 points per possessionClemson: 1.01Xavier: 1.00Wake Forest: 1.08Ohio State: 1.06Iowa State: 0.97Cincinnati: 0.97Kansas: 1.29It's not as if Kansas has bad defensive personnel, either. Melvin Council is an excellent point-of-attack defender. Tre White and Peterson have excellent positional size on the perimeter. Flory Bidunga is a fearsome rim protector, and Bryson Tiller is big and rangy. But Kansas' connection on the defensive end is sputtering. A sign of a locked-in defense is its ability to limit 3-point attempts for the best shooter on the scouting report. Kansas had no answer for Huff (4-11 from downtown), and that came four days after TCU's Liutauras Lelevicius drilled five triples himself.\nThat gaping hole better get cleaned up quickly ahead of Tuesday's matchup with sharpshooter Milan Momcilovic and No. 3 Iowa State.\n            ",

The Panthers finished the season with a record of just 8-9, but thanks to their having won the division, they get to host the Rams in this first-round game anyway. Los Angeles looked like it was headed for the No. 1 seed for much of the second half of the season, only to lose a pair of games down the stretch and fall into the No. 5 slot instead. The Rams finished with the second-best record in the conference at 12-5, but because they play in the same division as the No. 1-seeded Seattle Seahawks, they enter the postseason as a wild card team.\n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill the Rams advance, or will the Panthers pull off the upset at home?

Back in Week 13, the Rams headed into Carolina with a 9-2 record and sat atop the NFC. They were heavily favored over the Panthers, who were just 6-6 at the time. But things don't always go as you expect. Matthew Stafford turned the ball over three times. Bryce Young completed a pair of huge touchdown passes on fourth downs. And the Panthers upset the Rams 31-28, setting L.A. on a path that would lead it to blow its chance at the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye down the stretch of the season. Now, the Rams have their chance to exact revenge on the Panthers.Panthers run game. In the middle of the season, Rico Dowdle went berserk and the Panthers looked like they had one of the best run games in the NFL. They topped 100 rushing yards in seven straight games, 150 yards in three of them and 200 yards twice. They slowed down for a few games after that, rushing for south of 80 yards in three consecutive games, but then they popped up with 164 yards in their win over the Rams. They're coming off their worst rushing performance of the season (19 yards) in Week 18, so we'll have to see if they can get going on the ground again on Saturday.Puka and Davante. Puka Nacua had \"only\" 6 catches for 72 scoreless yards in the first matchup against Carolina. Davante Adams had 4 catches for 52 yards, but he was on the receiving end of two of L.A.'s touchdowns. The pair of wideouts form one of the most dynamic duos in the NFL. In the first Rams-Panthers game, they didn't have to deal with Panthers cornerback Jaycee Horn, who is one of the best in the league himself. It'll be interesting to see whether Horn shadows one receiver or the other, or if the Panthers just stick with him and Mike Jackson (who also had a nice season) playing certain sides of the field.Bryce Young vs. Rams pass defense. Young didn't have a ton of pass volume in the first game between these two teams. He threw only 20 passes. But when he did throw, it was incredibly beneficial for Carolina. He completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns, without throwing an interception, and he was also sacked only twice while rushing five times for 23 yards. The Rams are excellent up front on defense, but they can be leaky on the back end on occasion, as we saw in that first matchup. The Panthers will likely try to control the game with the rushing attack, but they need Young to hit on timely throws again.Prediction\nThe Rams looked like the best team in the NFL for most of the season. They stumbled down the stretch without Davante Adams, but they should have him back for this game. They'll also have revenge on their minds after they were upset by the Panthers earlier this season. But even that upset took Matthew Stafford turning the ball over three times and Bryce Young playing at a much higher level than he did for most of the season. I don't see those things repeating themselves on Saturday, so I've got to ride with the Rams here. Prediction: Rams 27, Panthers 16 | Pick: Rams -10\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers versus the Chicago Bears, the NFL's oldest/most-played rivalry with 213 games on the books including their upcoming playoff matchup, will be reignited for a third time in the 2025 season. Each team won at home in the regular season with both games ending in a one-score win. Bears quarterback Caleb Williams threw an interception to Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon with 27 seconds to play to seal a 28-21 Packers home win in Week 14 while Williams threw a 46-yard, game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver DJ Moore in a 22-16 overtime win in Week 16.   The last time these two teams played in Week 16, Packers quarterback Jordan Love got knocked out with a concussion in the second quarter, but he'll be back for this matchup after sitting out the final two games of the regular season. Love is a perfect 4-0 against the Bears in the four matchups with Chicago that he has started and finished in his three seasons as Green Bay's starting quarterback. The loss in Week 16 in 2025 and the loss in Week 18 in 2024 involved backup quarterback Malik Willis finishing the game because of an injury to Love. Green Bay is making its third playoff appearance in three seasons with Love as the team's starting quarterback while Chicago is making its first playoff appearance since 2020 and first of Williams' career under the guidance of first-year head coach Ben Johnson. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's almost time for the Packers vs. Bears grudge match at Soldier Field in the postseason after two thrilling, one-possession wins for each team this regular season. Here are the key things to know plus a game prediction for the first Green Bay vs. Chicago playoff game since the 2010 NFC Championship game, a game that was won 21-14 at Soldier Field by the visiting Packers en route to a Super Bowl XLV title. \nWhere to watch Bears vs. Packers liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 10 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Soldier Field (Chicago, Illinois)Stream: Amazon Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -1.5, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nPackers vs. Bears: Need to know\nHow crisp will Jordan Love, Josh Jacobs and Zack Tom be for Packers' offense? Love, running back Josh Jacobs and right tackle Zack Tom are all varying degrees of banged up. Love (concussion) should be good to go after not playing contact football for three weeks by the time this playoff matchup kicks off on Saturday night. Running back Josh Jacobs has been dealing with a knee issue since tweaking it on the MetLife Stadium turf back in Week 11. He had just four carries for three yards in Week 17 against the Baltimore Ravens before sitting out the Week 18 season finale at the Minnesota Vikings. Right tackle Zack Tom suffered a knee injury in Week 15 at the Denver Broncos, and he hasn't played since. Tom practiced as a limited participant every day this week while both Love and Jacobs are no longer on the team's injury report. That's an encouraging sign for Green Bay.Can the Bears' No. 3 rush offense take advantage of depleted Packers defensive line? \nOne of a number of things Ben Johnson was able to take with him from the Detroit Lions to the Chicago Bears in 2025 was a successful run game. Chicago is averaging 144.5 rushing yards per game this season, the third-most in the NFL this season. Green Bay is without both All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons (ACL) and stout defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt (ankle). Since Week 16, with both sidelined, the Packers are allowing an NFL-worst 198.0 rushing yards per game. Yes, that average is inflated by Derrick Henry's all-time performance (216 yards and four touchdowns on 36 carries) against them in Week 17, but the Packers did allow the Bears to rush for 150 against them in the Week 16 defeat at Soldier Field. This would appear to be an advantage for Chicago.Who is going to force the game-tilting turnover on defense? Packers safety Xavier McKinney totaled eight interceptions in 2024, the second-most in the league. Bears safety Kevin Byard led the NFL with eight interceptions in 2025. Which one of them will take away a football that flutters an extra second longer in the area out of the hand of Love or Williams after perhaps being hit on a throw? \nAs long as both quarterbacks remain healthy, this game has the makings of a high-scoring affair like the 28-21 Packers victory in Week 14. Whichever team can force that one crucial takeaway could take control of the game. Packers vs. Bears prediction\nWith Love healthy once again, he'll have a similar performance like he did in the first matchup between these teams when he threw three touchdowns, including a couple explosives to No. 1 receiver Christian Watson. Williams will play well like he did at the San Francisco 49ers on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 17, but like that night in Santa Clara, he'll come up just short in his first NFL playoff game. Pick: Packers 31, Bears 27 | (Packers -1.5, Over 44.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        And then there were two. The 2026 college football season has led to this: No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami will meet in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game to decide the best team in the country. In most years, the Hurricanes would be seen as an overwhelming favorite against Indiana. But Miami has gone on an underdog run of its own after making the playoff as the last at-large team. Indiana, meanwhile, has bowled over opposing teams en route to a 15-0 record. The Hoosiers are 2025's hegemon and it appears as if they aren't going away anytime soon. They handled their semifinal game against Oregon with ease, downing the Ducks 56-22. Miami, meanwhile, triumphed over Ole Miss in a 31-27 thriller that ranks as one of the best postseason games of the CFP era. \nThose semifinal games, of course, provided plenty of material to overreact to as the 2025 season nears its conclusion. Indiana is the best team of the CFP era Yes, better than 2019 LSU. The Hoosiers may not have as much elite NFL talent -- though quarterback Fernando Mendoza is a shoe-in to go first overall in the 2026 draft -- and the offense isn't quite as explosive, but they are a more complete team. Indiana's +473 point differential ranks first among schools in the playoff era (hat tip to my CBS Sports colleague Tom Fornelli). The Hoosiers have bludgeoned opposing teams by an average of 31.5 points per contest. Their last three wins against blue bloods Ohio State and Alabama and new blood Oregon have come by a combined score of 107-35. \nCurt Cignetti's squad has won all but one of its games against ranked opponents by at least 10 points. And Indiana is doing this in the Big Ten, one of the nation's premier conferences.  The Hoosiers are also on the precipice of becoming the first college football program to ever go 16-0. Of course, they have the benefit of playing in the expanded playoff years, but an undefeated season in the modern era of college football, when parity is at an all-time high thanks to NIL, seems like an accomplishment that won't be easily repeated. After all, only four NFL teams have ever completed undefeated seasons and it only happened once after the league went to a 16-game schedule. \n\n        \n            \n                Indiana vs. Miami: Early preview, odds, picks as Hoosiers will meet Hurricanes in CFP National Championship\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMiami's discipline issues will doom it against IndianaMiami was, somehow, able to overcome itself in the Fiesta Bowl against Ole Miss. The Hurricanes committed 10 penalties for a total of 74 yards, including a targeting foul that resulted in the ejection of cornerback Xavier Lucas. They dropped four potential interceptions. Those fouls allowed Ole Miss to hang around and even take the lead at certain points. Ultimately, the Rebels made a few crucial mistakes of their own -- and were pitiful on third down -- which allowed the Hurricanes to outlast Ole Miss. That won't do against the well-oiled Indiana machine. The Hoosiers rank third nationally with just 3.57 penalties per game. They're smart, they're disciplined and -- as was seen with D'Angelo Ponds' pick six to open Indiana's semifinal win over Oregon -- they will pounce all over any mistakes the opponent makes. \nUltimately, discipline will make the difference in a battle between two teams that stack up fairly well otherwise. Oregon is in trouble You've certainly heard of a clutch gene if you're a fan of sports. Oregon coach Dan Lanning has the opposite. In their last three playoff games against Power Four opponents, the Ducks have been outscored 97-66. That includes a 23-0 romp against Big 12 champion Texas Tech this season. \nTalent isn't the issue with Oregon. The Phil Knight money certainly helps, but the Ducks have always recruited at a high clip. Coach Dan Lanning has done a good job at the high school level and in the portal. But there's plenty of reason to be concerned about the path that Oregon is walking with Lanning, especially given the recent postseason results. This will be a big offseason for him. The Ducks are set to lose both of their bright young coordinators. Will Stein is headed to coach Kentucky while Tosh Lupoi will lead former Pac-12 foe California. \nIt is a good sign for a program's health when assistants get head coaching jobs, and it's a testament to what Lanning has built at the young age of 39. The next few months will be a huge test of his ability to keep the ship steady. Ole Miss is bigger than Lane KiffinIt was time to stop talking about Kiffin's move to LSU once the playoff began, but the two will always be intrinsically linked given the time that Kiffin had in Oxford and the messy nature in which he departed. While Kiffin deserves his flowers for elevating the standard at Ole Miss, it's clear that the Rebels have outgrown the need for him. His departure didn't do the program any favors or anything like that. Pete Golding has shown, in short order, that he can at least maintain the level of success that Kiffin established -- if not exceed it. Golding, after all, has more playoff wins than Kiffin at this point, and he's only been a head coach for three games. \nKiffin was certainly hoping that he'd be able to drag some of Ole Miss' top stars with him, but his decision instead galvanized the Rebels. Top running back Kewan Lacy, top linebacker Suntarine Perkins and edge rusher Princewill Umanmielen, along with a bevy of other key players, have already committed to returning. On top of that, Ole Miss is off to an incredible start in the transfer portal. The Rebels currently sit seventh in 247Sports' Team Transfer Rankings. They're one of just two schools in the top 10 with less than 10 commits thus far and their average prospect grade of 89.22 is first among top-15 transfer classes. Four of Ole Miss' nine transfer additions hold at least a four-star ranking. That includes LSU transfer Carius Curne, the No. 1 offensive tackle in the transfer portal, who spurned Kiffin for the Rebels. \n            ",

Both teams come limping in here as the Packers have lost four in a row and the Bears have lost two straight. The Bears have defensive issues that have shown up lately that Jordan Love, who will be back, can exploit. The Packers will go after Caleb Williams like they did in the two other meetings.

If they can stop Cook, that will put a lot on Josh Allen, who is more than capable. On the other side, the Bills have had defensive issues, while the Jaguars have played well on offense with Trevor Lawrence. Look for that to continue. This will be fun to watch as both quarterbacks light it up with Lawrence winning it late.Pick: Jaguars 32, Bills 28San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-5.5)Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles come in with a dominating defense, while the 49ers have a good offense. That's the matchup that will decide the game. The 49ers defense has struggled all year, while the Eagles offense has as well. Something has to give. I think the Eagles offense will get it going some here against the 49ers defense. Look for a big game from Saquon Barkley. On the other side, I look for the Eagles to limit Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense. The Eagles get it going some on offense and advance to the next round.Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 17Los Angeles Chargers (+3.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 8 p.m. ET on NBC\nThis is a long trip for the Chargers. It's also a big game for quarterback Justin Herbert, who has yet to win a playoff game. The problem is the offensive line in front of him has issues. The Patriots defense should be able to limit the Chargers' run game and pressure Herbert. On the other side, the Chargers have a top 10 defense and that could challenge Drake Maye. The Patriots have averaged 168.6 rushing yards per game and 5.8 yards per carry over the last five games, so look for them to run it early and often. If Herbert isn't protected on the other side, it could be a long night for the Chargers. But this is Maye's first playoff game and the Chargers defense is good against the pass. It's close, but the Pats win it late.   Pick: Patriots 24, Chargers 23Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Texans have one of the best defenses in the league and that can be a problem for a Steelers offense that is just OK. Aaron Rodgers does have a lot of playoff experience, which matters. He also gets back DK Metcalf in this one, which is big. The Steelers offensive line has also been good as of late. The Texans offense has been better during a nine-game winning streak, but this will come down to Houston's offensive line against the Steelers' front. That's a problem. Look for the Steelers to force some mistakes by C.J. Stroud as Pittsburgh advances behind its defensive front in a playoff upset.Pick: Steelers 23, Texans 20Los Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina PanthersSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Panthers beat the Rams in Week 13 thanks to a lot of big plays by both the offense and defense. Matthew Stafford threw three picks in that game. That won't happen again. Look for a much better offensive effort from the Rams. The Panthers ran it well against the Rams in the last meeting, so that will again be the focus here. Bryce Young also made some key throws in that game. But this is a big challenge for a young Panthers team. The Rams are playoff tested and Stafford and gang will play like it. Rams big.Pick: Rams 31, Panthers 17\n            ",

    "body": "\n        2025 has been quite a year for the United States men's national team as they've closed the year with a five game unbeaten streak. With the clock inching closer to the World Cup on home soil in 2026, the USMNT are finding their form at the right moment despite being without regulars. Mauricio Pochettino has dug deep in order to bring new players into the fold and also adjusted the tactical setup of the team.Moving to a back three has made up for the absence of Tyler Adams in being able to provide cover for the midfield while also ensuring that the USMNT has a more repeatable buildup by pushing fullbacks up the pitch in support of the hot form of Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun. But, since it's Christmas, what are a few things that the USMNT have put under the Christmas Tree this year, as well as something that they need going into a critical 2026?Gift 1 -- Restoring beliefThe past few years have been rough since getting knocked out of the 2022 World Cup at the hands of the Netherlands. From the Copa America disappointment in 2024, getting knocked out during the group stage of the tournament on home soil, which led to the dismissal of Gregg Berhalter, to falling at the Concacaf Nations League and Concacaf Gold Cup, even the start of Pochettino's tenure did not inspire confidence. But facing Japan in September was when things began to shift.Pochettino deployed a back three in that match, and the USMNT haven't looked back since. That match may not have seen them face Japan's best squad, but with subsequent wins over World Cup-bound sides in Uruguay and Paraguay, the USMT were able to show that they're up for the challenge of going ot the World Cup. The difficulty level of their opposition will be ratcheted up in March when they face Belgium and Portugal, but those are also the exact kind of tests that the USMNT need to be ready for the World Cup. Ending the year on a high note only adds to the good feelings that Pochettino has brought back into the USMNT. The challenge will be keeping vibes high, but positivity is something that USMNT fans will appreciate finding under the Christmas tree as the World Cup inches closer.\nGift 2 -- Depth in key areasWho would've thought that entering 2025, Sebastian Berhalter, Max Arfsten, and Alex Freeman would be pushing for the World Cup squad? Diego Luna and Tanner Tessmann also saw major playing time increases under Pochettino, but given their time at the Olympics, it's a bit less out of the blue than the aforementioned trio. Lyon has provided the USMNT with a secondary gift by playing Tessemann at center back at times during the season. With the USMNT lacking depth in defense, that could be needed at the World Cup, where positional flexibility is key. With the rise of Arfsten and Freeman, the USMNT could carry four fullbacks at the World Cup and need to have players like Tessmann who can plug in at center back to compensate. It may have been a lot of changes for Pochettino to dig through the USMNT player pool, but the fruit is beginning to be seen ahead of 2026. There are more areas where players like Noahkai Banks of Augsburg could also break in, but outside of center back and defensive midfield, this is a USMNT well set heading into 2026.Gift 3 -- The form of the forwards2025 has been the year of Christian Pulisic as he pushes for the Serie A title with Milan. While his side were met with disappointment in the Supercoppa Italiana, falling to Napoli, Pulisic has nine goals and two assists in only 14 appearances for the club this seaon. He's been extremely consistent since making the move to Milan, and that consistency has also carried over to the USMNT. It was also a positive sight that without Pulisic starting the last four matches of 2025 for the USMNT, they were able to go undefeated in them, but some of that is down to how another forward has performed this year.\nFolarin Balogun has become the main man for Monaco while also establishing that he is the number nine for the USMNT when healthy going forward. Scoring three goals in his last five games for the USMNT, when Balogun has been on the pitch, even if he's not having a great match overall, he has been able to push that aside to score when a chance comes his way, which is exactly what you want to see from a top striker. Getting Champions League experience while settling for Monaco has gone a long way, and it couldn't come at a better time.Gift four -- Gio Reyna's returnIt has been quite a year for Gio Reyna. He made a move from Borussia Dortmund to Borussia Monchengladbach, and while he's still been working his way to be a consistent starter for the German side, the September international break saw him return to the USMNT fold. It was clear that Reyna and the USMNT were ready to put the past behind them, and it wouldn't take long with him scoring a header only four minutes into their match against Paraguay. The relief could be seen, and despite Malik Tillman being the top attacking midfielder in the USMNT pool now, it was a moment where Reyna established himself as a contender for the World Cup squad as well. Teammates spoke about how much they enjoyed sharing the pitch with Reyna, and that's something which shouldn't be taken for granted since chemistry will be important to success at the World Cup. \nLump of coal: Health and defendersIt wasn't all smiles for the USMNT as depth is a fragile thing. Pochettino, utilizing a back three, was almost forced by not having a natural replacement for Adams in defensive midfield, and entering 2026, Adams will be out for 2-3 months with a torn MCL. The captain for the USMNT during the 2022 World Cup, the USMNT will need Adams during this World Cup on home soil, as defensive midfield is somewhere that another player hasn't stepped up. The back three has gotten the job done, but at times, if Pochettino is going to truly open up the attack, he'll need a strong defensive presence in midfield.Defense is also thin, with Chris Richards and a 38-year-old Tim Ream being the top options for Pochettino. Mark McKenzie is emerging as one in a back three, but defensively, things are fluid, and Richards getting stretchered off during Crystal Palace's EFL Cup defeat showed just how fragile that depth is. Pochettino has tried a host of center backs alongside his top two, and the results have been mixed, but for 2026 to be a success someone has to emerge in the defense.\n            ",

He played through the injury in the team's next three games before missing three games to try to recover from the injury. In his first game back from that absence, he registered 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns.Overall, Bowers finishes the season with 64 receptions for 780 yards and seven touchdowns -- all team highs, but the first two categories significantly down from a historic 112-catch, 1,194-yard debut season. Bowers' 112 receptions were a rookie record, and his 1,194 yards were a rookie tight end record.\nThe Raiders finish the season with games against the New York Giants and against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Week 17 matchup in New York is an important one, as both teams sport 2-13 records, tied for the worst in the NFL. The loser of that game will take over the top spot in the NFL Draft order.Rice, 25, appeared in just 11 games. After being suspended the first six games of the season, he returned and provided an immediate spark to the offense, accruing 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns. However, he reported concussion symptoms after Week 15 and was inactive in Week 16. Now, with Kansas City's playoff hopes extinguished and Patrick Mahomes (ACL) done for the season, the Chiefs have shut down Rice as well.\nHere's a list of notable players whose seasons have come to an end due to an injury in the past few weeks.Dec. 24: Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee)Dec. 24: Chiefs WR Rashee Rice (concussion)Dec. 24: Chiefs CB Trent McDuffie (knee)Dec. 24: Dallas Cowboys OT Tyler Guyton (ankle)Dec. 23: New York Jets QB Justin Fields (knee)Dec. 23: Cincinnati Browns RB Quinshon Judkins (leg/ankle)Dec. 20: Cowboys CB DaRon Bland (foot)Dec. 20: Giants EDGE Kayvon ThibodeauxDec. 19: Jets QB Garrett Wilson (knee)Dec. 19: Minnesota Vikings OT Christian DarrisawDec. 17: Green Bay Packers EDGE Micah Parsons (ACL)Dec. 17: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (ACL)Dec. 17: Vikings EDGE Jonathan Greenard (shoulder)Dec. 15: Washington Commanders QB Jayden Daniels (elbow)Dec. 13: Detroit Lions S Brian BranchDec. 13: Indianapolis Colts QB Daniel Jones (Achilles)Dec. 13: San Francisco 49ers WR Brandon Aiyuk (knee)Dec. 11: Cincinnati Bengals EDGE Trey Hendrickson (hip/pelvis)Dec. 1: Lions CB Terrion Arnold (shoulder)Nov. 26: Atlanta Falcons QB Michael Penix Jr. (ACL)\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        What's better than opening presents on Christmas Day? Opening presents on Christmas and watching the NFL, of course!We have ourselves a tripleheader of NFL action on the holiday, and some of these contests have legitimate playoff implications. For instance, the Detroit Lions are trying to keep their postseason hopes alive and need to win out (and have the Green Bay Packers lose out) to sneak in, so this is very much a playoff game in their eyes. Meanwhile, if the Denver Broncos win out over these next two games, they'll be the No. 1 seed in the AFC.While those are the playoff implications for this Christmas Day slate, one of the other storylines will be the onslaught of injuries at quarterback for an array of these teams suiting up on Thursday. The Commanders, Vikings and Chiefs will all be starting backups, which sort of feels like a lump of coal, but we'll make do.As we do every week, we've collected all of the best picks and gambling content from CBSSports.com and SportsLine and put them in one place, so you can get sports betting picks against the spread from our CBS Sports experts as well as additional feature content for each game, including plays from top SportsLine experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, best bets from our staff, survivor picks and more this Christmas.NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Dallas Cowboys at Washington CommandersThursday, 1 p.m. ET on NetflixCowboys -7: \"This looked like it might be a big Christmas Day game before the season, but it's not close to being one. Both teams are eliminated, and the Commanders don't have their starting quarterback or likely their backup in Marcus Mariota. It could be Josh Johnson. Look for Dallas and Dak Prescott to go in and light up the Washington defense. Cowboys win it.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he likes the Cowboys to cover with a 31-23 victory over the Commanders.

If so, you're coming down to the wire, and each decision you make over these next two weeks could be the difference between outlasting the competition or falling just short. To give yourself the best shot of making it all the way, allow SportsLine's R.J. White to help make your decision this week. White has been a must-see source when it comes to betting on the NFL and has been remarkably sharp in survivor pool settings. While White has this game between Denver and Kansas City circled as one of his options for Week 17, it's not his top choice. To see that play, head over the SportsLine. \nChiefs +13.5: \"The Broncos are coming off a bad loss to the Jaguars, so their focus will be good here. The Chiefs are done and hardly look like the team we've come to know the past eight years. Chris Oladokun will start at quarterback against a good Denver defense. Good luck with that. The Broncos will rebound, but pride might keep the Chiefs in it for a bit.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he has Denver pulling out the 24-13 victory over Kansas City.

His rights were traded to the New York Knicks in 2024. However, Nnaji never signed an NBA contract, and instead has been playing in Europe, most recently with Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey on loan from Spain's FC Barcelona. He averaged 7.5 and 4.0 rebounds with Yukatel Merkezefendi.Nnaji and Barcelona -- the team he had been with since 2020 -- mutually agreed to part ways after the 2024-25 season.Most recently, he played with the Knicks in the 2025 Summer League.\nNnaji was listed at 6-feet-11 and 226 pounds when he was drafted as an 18-year-old, and Givony lists him as 7-feet and 251 pounds with a 7-7 wingspan currently.\"There was serious steam for Nnaji to work his way into the back end of the first round, so Charlotte moving up to acquire him at No. 31 feels like decent value here,\" Kyle Boone wrote of Nnaji when he was drafted. \"Nnaji's measurables in terms of his size and length are impressive and he's a big leaper who can finish above the rim, though he does present as something of a project for the Hornets.\"\nInstead, in a wild twist, he'll end up playing college basketball more than two years after being drafted. Baylor is 9-2 this season and has been without Juslin Bodo Bodo (arm) and Maikcol Perez (ACL), two expected front-court contributors.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA's Christmas Day tradition continues this year with a five-game slate featuring some of the best teams and players in the league, including the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder and reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander trying to avenge some recent losses against the up-and-coming San Antonio Spurs, led by Victor Wembanyama. Donovan Mitchell, Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns, De'Aaron Fox, Jalen Williams, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Cooper Flagg, LeBron James, Luka Dončić, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards are some of the other stars who will be in action throughout the day. The action will tip off with a Madison Square Garden matinee featuring the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers, and conclude with a Mile High matchup between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets. Before you settle in for 12 hours of hoops, let's take a closer look at the slate with an X-factor to keep an eye on and a bold prediction for each game. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Cavaliers at New York KnicksTime: 12 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free) Odds: Knicks -6 | O/U: 238.5 (via FanDuel)X-factor: Jaylon TysonTyson didn't play much as a rookie, but he's quietly become an important piece for the Cavs this season. He's averaging 13 points, 5.4 rebounds and two assists on 52.4/45/78.4 shooting splits in 19 starts. He's fourth on the team in minutes and has been their best 3-point shooter thus far. \nDuring this chaotic season in Cleveland, Tyson has been one of the few constants. He's also been unafraid to speak his mind, and called out the team earlier in the season for a lack of effort. \"We're not hungry enough,\" Tyson said after their loss to the Celtics on Nov. 30. \"I feel like teams want it more than us, there's a target on a lot of our guys' backs, and it's everyone's job to say, 'you wanna come at us, let's go.'\"Tyson and the Cavaliers will have a chance to respond on Christmas. Bold prediction: The Cavaliers will winIt's crazy that this qualifies as a bold prediction, but the Cavaliers have been the most disappointing team in the league. After winning 64 games last season, they're just 17-14 and stuck in seventh place in the Eastern Conference. While they've had major injury issues, poor health doesn't explain everything that's gone on in Cleveland this season. This remains one of the most talented rosters in the league, and the Cavs are only two games back of the No. 3 seed in the crowded middle of the pack in the East. Their Christmas showdown with the Knicks is the perfect opportunity to snap out of their funk, pick up a signature win and start climbing back up the standings. They'll enter the game off the back of consecutive victories (albeit against the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans) where they put up 139 and 141 points, respectively, which should give them a real confidence boost. \n\n        \n            \n                Can the Cavaliers -- the NBA's most expensive team -- snap out of their funk?\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Antonio Spurs at Oklahoma City ThunderTime: 2:30 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Thunder -9.5 | O/U: 233.5X-factor: Luke KornetThe Spurs gave Kornet a four-year deal in free agency to steal him away from the Boston Celtics and shore up their frontcourt situation behind Victor Wembanyama. That was hailed as a smart move in the offseason, and looks even better now. Kornet slid into the starting lineup while Wembanyama was out with a calf injury, and has remained in that role as the Spurs work the French phenom back slowly. Kornet is averaging career-highs of 8.2 points, 6.7 rebounds, two assists and 1.4 blocks per game, while shooting 63.5% from the field. He doesn't put up huge numbers, but he's always in the right spot and making smart, connective plays. Somehow, he also seems to be good for one highlight reel play each night. In the Spurs' win over the Thunder on Tuesday, he threw down an alley-oop over Chet Holmgren. \nBold prediction: There will be multiple technical foulsFamiliarity breeds contempt, as the saying goes, and this will be the third matchup between these teams in the last two weeks. The first two have been competitive, physical affairs won by the up-and-coming Spurs. There's also some real animosity between Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren. \nThe Thunder are going to be back at home on national TV looking for revenge and to snap their first skid (2-3 in their last five games) of the season. It would not be a surprise to see some emotions boil over on Christmas. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas Mavericks at Golden State WarriorsTime: 5 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Warriors -8 | O/U: 227.5X-factor: Ryan NembhardRyan Nembhard, the younger brother of Pacers point guard Andrew Nembhard, went undrafted this year despite leading the NCAA in assists last season. It hasn't taken him long to prove that every single team besides the Mavericks made a mistake by passing on him. After playing sparingly early in the season, he earned the starting point guard role the day after Thanksgiving and hasn't given it back. He's averaging 10.9 points and seven assists on 51.5 shooting, including 48.6% from 3-point range as a starter, and is coming off an 11-point, seven-assist effort in the Mavericks' victory over the Thunder, during which he played all but eight seconds of the fourth quarter. \nBold prediction: Stephen Curry scores 40 pointsIt's unbelievable that Curry is still carrying such a burden for the Warriors and scoring so efficiently while doing so. In NBA history only four other players -- Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Alex English -- have averaged at least 20 shots per game after turning 35. None of them have been as efficient as Curry, who is shooting 39.8% on 12.3 3-point attempts per game, and boasts a 64.2% true shooting percentage.Curry has always had the ultimate green light, but this season, in particular, he can do whatever he wants. Jimmy Butler doesn't seem super interested in shooting, Brandin Podziemski is their third-leading scorer at 12.4 points per game and Draymond Green has more turnovers (75) than made baskets (72). Curry already has four 40-point games this season, and a showcase game on Christmas against the No. 1 pick is a perfect time to add another one. He's certainly going to take enough shots to get there. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Rockets at Los Angeles LakersTime: 8 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Odds: Rockets -3.5 | O/U: 229.5X-factor: Reed SheppardAfter a strong start to the season, the Rockets have lost four of their last five games to fall to 17-10 and sixth place in the Western Conference. Their lone win during that skid came against the Nuggets when Reed Sheppard hit a career-high six 3-pointers en route to 28 points, his second-highest scoring game of the season. \nSheppard, the No. 3 pick in last year's draft, barely played as a rookie, but has been thrust into a big role this season due to Fred VanVleet's injury. Boasting extreme confidence in his shot, Sheppard has been lighting it up from behind the arc. He's making 43.5% of his 6.3 3-point attempts per game, and leads the Rockets with 73 makes from long distance. In fact, he's made nearly a quarter of their 3s on the season. The Rockets are dead last in 3-point attempts per game (30.2), and are perhaps overly reliant on Sheppard to provide an outside threat that opponents have to respect. Despite some inconsistent production from the second-year man, Houston has a 121.9 offensive rating with Sheppard on the floor and a 115.7 offensive rating when he sits. The Rockets are 5-2 when Sheppard scores more than 15 points and 12-8 when he does not. If they want to beat the high-powered Lakers, they may need a big night from Sheppard. \nBold prediction: This is the last time LeBron plays on ChristmasNo one has played on Christmas Day more often than LeBron James, who is making his 20th appearance on the holiday. Earlier this month, he made it clear that he's had enough of the occasion. \"I'd much rather be at home with my family,\" James said earlier this week. \"But I mean, it's the game, it's the game I love. It's the game I watched when I was a kid on Christmas Day, watching a lot of the greatest play the game on Christmas. It's always been an honor to play it. Obviously, I'm gonna be completely honest, I would like to be home on the couch with my family all throughout the day. But my number is called -- our number is called, so we have to go out and perform and I look forward to it.\"James has not announced any retirement plans, but given his age (he'll turn 41 next week), growing injury issues due to sciatica and these comments, it's fair to wonder if this is the last time we'll see him suit up on Christmas. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Timberwolves at Denver NuggetsTime: 10:30 p.m. ETWatch: ABC/ESPN/fubo (Try for free)  Spread: Nuggets -4 | O/U: 238.5X-factor: Tim Hardaway Jr. Hardaway was one of the Nuggets' many veteran additions during the offseason, and has been a perfect fit alongside Nikola Jokić. He's shooting a career-high 41.7% from 3-point range on six attempts per game, is the team's leading scorer off the bench and has appeared in every game this season. Hardaway has been a constant source of production for the Nuggets while Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun have been sidelined, and has helped the team maintain a 21-8 record, which is good for third place in the Western Conference. If they want to get back on track and take down the Timberwolves after a narrow loss to the Mavericks on Tuesday, they'll need another strong showing from Hardaway, who has had at least 20 points and six 3s in each of his last two games. Bold prediction: Anthony Edwards is going to put someone on a posterEdwards said earlier this month that he doesn't consider himself a superstar. \"I don't think it's no pressure. I don't think I'm under a spotlight. I don't really think I'm a superstar,\" Edwards said. \"I think to some people I may be. But to myself, I'm really not. So I don't really put no pressure on myself. They got other guys in the league for that.\"\nHowever he categorizes himself, he's one of the game's best players and thrives under the bright lights. He'll be eager to put on a show on Christmas, especially against another Western Conference contender. Don't be surprised if he tries to put someone on a poster in the process. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are riding high following their Week 16 upset victory over the Detroit Lions, and are the clear-cut frontrunners in the AFC North with a 9-6 record. To add to the good vibes, Mike Tomlin's defense is getting closer to returning their most important player.On Wednesday, star pass rusher T.J. Watt attended practice for the first time since undergoing lung surgery after a dry needling mishap, though he was listed as a limited participant. Coach Tomlin said that Watt's status for the Week 17 matchup against the Cleveland Browns is unclear right now, but this was clearly a step in the right direction.\"It's awesome to have him out there,\" fellow pass rusher Alex Highsmith said, via ESPN. \"Just seeing him back out in the field with us, he's getting better every single day, so I think just to have him back out there, just as a leader for our group, it's just awesome to see. Excited to see how he continues to work his way back.\"Two weeks ago, Watt went to a Pittsburgh hospital after experiencing discomfort in his chest. That led to him undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung. \n\"Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,\" Watt's brother, J.J. Watt, posted on social media on Dec. 12. \"Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today.   He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.\"Watt recorded 53 combined tackles, 10 tackles for loss, seven sacks, three forced fumbles and one interception in the first 13 games of the season. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is the league leader in forced fumbles (36) and QB hits (243) since being selected with the No. 30 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and has recorded the fifth-most sacks in a player's first nine seasons all-time with 115.0.\nThe Steelers can officially clinch the AFC North with a win over the Browns on Sunday, or a Baltimore Ravens loss to the Green Bay Packers on Saturday. Pittsburgh is looking to extend a three-game win streak, in which the team is averaging 28 points per game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We've got a full slate of games on tap for Week 17, including three games on Thursday for Christmas and two games on Saturday. A full slate of games means a jam-packed injury report, unfortunately; and because it's late in the season, the reports are even deeper than they would be earlier in the year.In the space below, you will be able to see game statuses for the Thursday kickoffs, as well as updates on key players from the initial injury reports for Saturday and Sunday's slates of games.All NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Dallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders (+8.5) (Thursday)Commanders: Nick Bellore (concussion), Jayden Daniels (left elbow), Marcus Mariota (right hand/quad), Daron Payne (back), Laremy Tunsil (oblique) OUTWashington is down to Josh Johnson as its starting quarterback. It will be without important pieces on the offensive and defensive lines. Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings (+7.5) (Thursday)Lions: Avonte Maddox (back/illness), Giovanni Manu (knee) OUT; Marcus Davenport (shoulder), Taylor Decker (shoulder/rest), Khalil Dorsey (illness), Tom Kennedy (abdomen), Christian Mahogany (fibula), Alim McNeill (abdomen), David Montgomery (illness), Al-Quadin Muhammad (knee), Amik Robertson (hand), Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) QUESTIONABLEVikings: T.J. Hockenson (shoulder), Ryan Kelly (concussion), Jordan Mason (ankle), J.J. McCarthy (right hand) OUT; Brian O'Neill (heel) QUESTIONABLEThe Lions seemingly have half their roster listed as questionable here, including two important offensive linemen, their top wide receiver and an important running back. They're also banged up on all levels of the defense.\nMinnesota's offense is extremely banged up heading into this game. Max Brosmer is starting in McCarthy's place and he could be without two starting offensively linemen, in addition to two of his key weapons.Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs (+13.5) (Thursday)Broncos: Karene Reid (hamstring), Nate Adkins (knee), Pat Bryant (concussion), Dre Greenlaw (hamstring), Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) OUTChiefs: Jake Briningstool (hamstring) OUT; Jaylon Moore (knee), Derrick Nnadi (illness), Nikko Remigio (knee), George Karlaftis (illness), Nick Bolton (illness) QUESTIONABLEThe Broncos will be without one of their rotational receivers as well as one of their premier linebackers but should remain heavily favored in large part due to Kansas City's volume of injuries.Kansas City placed by Rashee Rice, Tyquan Thornton, Trent McDuffie and Jaylen Watson all on injured reserve.

    "body": "\nThe University of Hawaii football team rarely has had to travel for a bowl game, as 23 of the 26 contests in which it appeared were played in the Aloha State. That advantage hasn't exactly translated to success, as the Rainbow Warriors went 10-13 in those bowls.Hawaii (8-4) has the opportunity to improve its record in local bowl games on Wednesday as it takes on California (7-5) at 8 p.m. ET in the 2025 Hawaii Bowl at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex in Honolulu. The Rainbow Warriors, who appeared in now-defunct bowl games in their home state such as the Poi Bowl, Pineapple Bowl, Aloha Bowl and Oahu Bowl, have played in the Hawaii Bowl nine previous times -- most recently in 2019, when they posted a 38-34 victory over BYU.The Rainbow Warriors are 5-4 in the Hawaii Bowl and 12-14 overall in their bowl appearances after defeating Houston 28-14 in the 2020 New Mexico Bowl. California, which saw its bowl record fall to 12-13-1 with its 24-13 loss to UNLV in last year's LA Bowl, is making its second appearance in a bowl game held in Hawaii, with its first being a 42-38 loss to Navy in the 1996 Aloha Bowl. This year's Hawaii Bowl takes center stage on Wednesday, as there are no games on the NBA, NHL and college basketball schedules. The Rainbow Warriors are 1.5-point favorites against the Golden Bears in the latest consensus college football odds, with the over/under set at 51.5.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Dec. 24. All times EasternCFB best bets, where to watchHawaii Bowl: Hawaii vs. CaliforniaTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Honolulu | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: California -105 | Expert: Hawaii +1.5 (-110, Jeff Hochman)Both teams ended their regular seasons on a high note, as Hawaii defeated Wyoming 27-7 and California edged then-No. 21 SMU 38-35. This essentially is a home game for the Rainbow Warriors, who won six of their seven contests in Honolulu this year. The Golden Bears split their six road contests in 2025, with one of their victories coming in overtime against then-No. 15 Louisville. Cal quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who is a native of Hawaii, is 18th in the nation with an average of 259.8 passing yards and has thrown for more than 300 yards in each of his team's last two wins. The freshman set a season high with four touchdown passes in the regular-season finale, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees him doing enough to pick up a victory in the Hawaii Bowl as the Golden Bears win in 59% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman (+542 on his last 16 college football against-the-spread picks) likes the fact that Hawaii is third in the country in red-zone scoring and has a plus-3.6 point differential with QB Micah Alejado, who is ninth nationally with 283.2 passing yards per game. Hochman managed to clock in early on the Rainbow Warriors and got them at +1.5.Looking aheadNFLLions at VikingsTime: 4:30 p.m., Thursday | Location: Minneapolis | TV: Netflix | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Lions -7.5 (-105) | Expert: Over 44.5 (-105, R.J. White)This is a must-win game for the Lions, whose hopes of making three consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 1993-95 are hanging by a thread. Detroit has lost three of its last four contests and needs to win out while the Green Bay Packers lose their final two games in order to earn a wild card berth. The Lions dropped a 27-24 decision to Minnesota at home in Week 9, and the Vikings enter the rematch with a three-game winning streak that has followed a four-game slide. Max Hosmer will be under center for Minnesota in place of J.J. McCarthy (hand), and the SportsLine Projection Model believes that will be a significant advantage for the Lions and is leaning toward a cover by Detroit. SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White (+458 on his last 33 NFL over/under picks) thinks the Lions will produce points as usual and the Vikings will do enough against Detroit's banged-up secondary for the Over to hit.Broncos at ChiefsTime: 8:15 p.m., Thursday | Location: Kansas City, Mo. | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Chiefs +13.5 (-112) | Expert: RJ Harvey Over 14.5 carries (-114, PropBetGuy)Kansas City's nine-year reign atop the AFC West is over and Denver already has secured its second straight playoff berth after enduring an eight-year drought. The race for a new division champion got tighter last week as the Broncos were beaten 34-20 at home by the Jacksonville Jaguars to end their 11-game winning streak and shrink their lead to one game over the Los Angeles Chargers, who topped the Cowboys 34-17 in Dallas for their fourth straight victory. The Chiefs have lost four in a row and are down to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun as Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew are done for the season with knee injuries. Denver will be eager to atone for last week's performance and move closer to securing their first AFC West title since 2015, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't feel a blowout will occur as its simulations have the Chiefs covering the spread 60% of the time. Broncos running back RJ Harvey had only seven carries against Jacksonville after reaching double digits in each of his previous four outings, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (43-25, +1433 on his last 68 NFL player prop picks) expects his workload to be much heavier this week.NBASpurs at ThunderTime: 2:30 p.m., Thursday | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Thunder -9.5 (-106)The NBA gave its fans a nice present when it scheduled a matchup between the top two teams in the Western Conference on Christmas Day. San Antonio has used a seven-game winning streak to get within 3 1/2 games of Oklahoma City, which won 24 of its first 25 games -- including 16 straight from Nov. 7-Dec. 10 -- but has lost three of its last five. Two of those defeats came against the Spurs, who ended the Thunder's lengthy winning streak with a 111-109 triumph in Las Vegas on Dec. 13 in the NBA Cup semifinals and cruised to a 130-110 victory at home two days ago. Stephon Castle was a major offensive contributor for San Antonio in both games, as he was one of three members of the team with 22 points in the first win and scored 24 on Tuesday. Reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is second in the league in scoring with an average of 32.5 points, led all players in both contests with 29 and 33 points. The Thunder haven't lost back-to-back games since Apr. 4-6 of last season and have dropped three to the Spurs in one campaign only once since 2010-11. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Thunder answering the bell in a big way Thursday as they cover the large spread in 62% of its simulations.\n            ",

    "body": "\nSportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman successfully nailed both of his Week 16 betting system picks, taking the Bengals against the Dolphins and the Raiders against the Texans when looking at teams who bounce back after being shut out in a loss. Hochman has shifted his focus to Week 17 and has identified a play under his system which looks at division games featuring low totals.NFL divisional underdogs in games with totals of 42 or lessWin Rate: 84-57-4 ATS (59.5%)Sample Size: Since 2013Criteria: Any divisional underdog in a game with a total of 42 or lessEdge: November and December outdoor gamesWhy does this work?There's something about Week 17 when division rivals meet. These teams know each other inside out, so games are scrappy and points are hard to come by. Oddsmakers aren't fooled— they set the totals low, figuring defense and weather will do their part. And the underdog? They get a few more points than usual, just because it's such a familiar battle. If you're paying attention, there's an edge to be found.Week 17 qualifiersCleveland Browns +3.5 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers | Confidence: 5 out of 5\nThe Browns feel like a good pick to cover +3.5 against the Steelers. If Pittsburgh already has the AFC North title wrapped up, you can bet the Steelers will sit their main guys. For Cleveland, this game is everything—the Browns will be fired up, especially with Myles Garrett chasing the sack record. Playing at home gives them a little extra juice, too. Even if the Steelers are the more talented team, the Browns have plenty of reasons to show up big.When Mike Tomlin was directly asked about resting starters if the division is clinched, he stated: \"It's possible.\" For a 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers nursing a left wrist injury, combined with the Steelers' extensive injury list (T.J. Watt out, Seumalo out, Pierre out, Herbig questionable), a rest scenario becomes operationally sensible. The Steelers currently hold the No. 4 seed—clinching before their contest means there's no seeding benefit to winning in Cleveland, only an increased injury risk before the playoffs.The Browns are out of the playoff hunt, sitting on the No. 3 overall pick with about a 25% shot at landing the top spot. While the 2026 draft isn't packed with quarterback talent, the 2027 class looks far more promising. But don't expect Cleveland to roll over just to boost its draft odds—especially not with the Steelers on the other side. These teams have a real rivalry, and pride always matters in this matchup. This asymmetry means the Browns may effectively be the more motivated team on the field—an unusual dynamic in a contest where Pittsburgh is 9-6 and Cleveland is 3-12.\nPittsburgh just lost its top receiver for the next two games—850 yards and 6 touchdowns out the window because of a suspension. Losing DK Metcalf really stings. He was targeted 99 times this season and was the Steelers' go-to guy for making things happen downfield. That leaves Pittsburgh counting on Adam Thielen, who's 34 and not exactly a picture of health, and Calvin Austin III, who's banged up and might not even play. Without Metcalf, it's a tall order for Rodgers—he's already throwing for just 6.9 yards per attempt (NFL average is 7.0), and his QBR (44.3) is well below average (50.0). With their best deep threat out, the Steelers could really struggle to keep drives alive or hit those big, momentum-shifting plays.This matchup really favors the Browns' pass rush going up against a shaky Steelers offensive line. Keep in mind, Pittsburgh is just 3-9 straight up when T.J. Watt is out. On top of that, the weather looks windy (15-25 mph), which could make throwing the ball tricky. Most of the public is loading up on the Steelers—73% of spread bets and 75% of the cash, per DraftKings. Take the points where you can, and don't shy away from sprinkling a little on the Browns' money line.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Things at the top of the NBA Draft Big Board are relatively stable from a month ago, but that may not last long. Questions about the durability (and availibilty) of Kansas' Darryn Peterson, coupled with the ascension of BYU's AJ Dybantsa and the exceptional play of Duke's Cameron Boozer have narrowed the gap for the No. 1  overall pick as we head into conference play.While those top three remain in a class among themselves, UNC power forward Caleb Wilson's consistency, athleticism, rebounding and versatile defensive tools are closing the gap. Meanwhile, Tennessee's Nate Ament has had some bumps in the road recently in the Volunteers' jumbo lineups, but is still the type of combo-forward that usually pans any well long-term in the association.Who's top point guard?There's also an interesting battle behind Peterson at the point guard position. Louisville's Mikel Brown is the most skilled of the bunch, while Houston's Kingston Flemings is the most explosive. Scouts are worried about Brown's durability and defense and still have questions about the sustainability of Flemings shooting. Arkansas' Darius Acuff meanwhile isn't the most explosive or skilled, but he very well may be the best college player.Flemings, who moved from No. 15 to No. 7 this month, isn't the only high-level athlete to make a jump. A month ago, it seemed almost aggressive to have Baylor's Cameron Carr on the fringe of the first round. That was until I got the chance to watch him live in Las Vegas at the Players Era and then it became clear that was way too low. With Carr's combination of length, athleticism, shot-making, and scoring, he's now played his way to the fringe of the lottery, even if he does have to keep building up his body.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Draft: 10 observations from a loaded Players Era event in Las Vegas\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWashington's Steinbach moves upThe most notable riser in the frontcourt is Washington's Hannes Steinbach. The freshman from Germany has real size and strength with great hands and a soft touch. He's a high-volume rebounder and showing some flashes of being able to stretch the floor. Steinbach's understanding of the nuances of ball-screen play is also exemplary. The way the NBA is now trending back towards bigger frontlines is also relevant, since he fits better in that better then he does four around one schemes.\nNew to the Big BoardThis iteration of the big board also includes some new names. Texas Tech's Christian Anderson and Duke's Patrick Ngongba are both making their debut, and making it in first-round territory. Questions about Anderson's size will linger, but his skill and productivity are undeniable. For Ngongba, the lack of lateral quickness will remain a concern, but the shot-blocking and floor-spacing is intriguing enough to compensate when he's healthy. Other notable newcomers include Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson (30), Wake Forest's Juke Harris (40), and Alabama's Amari Allen (44).\nBig Board Top 101Darryn PetersonKansasPG6-6205Fr2AJ DybantsaBYUSF6-9215Fr3Cameron BoozerDukePF6-9250Fr4Caleb WilsonNorth CarolinaPF6-10215Fr5Mikel BrownLouisvillePG6-4190Fr6Nate AmentTennesseePF6-10207Fr7Kingston FlemingsHoustonPG6-4190Fr8Jayden QuaintanceKentuckyC6-10255So9Koa PeatArizonaPF6-8235Fr10Thomas HaughFloridaSF6-9215JrThe Big Board has been updated to include the top 60 NBA Draft Prospects\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing, and with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Wednesday's Christmas Eve roundup just below. Yankees among teams interested in HaysVeteran outfielder Austin Hays is seeing his free agent market pick up. \nThe Yankees are among the teams with some level of interest in Hays, the New York Post reports. However, the Yankees would likely pursue Hays only if fellow outfielder Cody Bellinger, a core member of the Yankees last season and one of their top offseason targets, signs elsewhere. Hays has previously been reported to be of interest to the Mets and Royals. \nHays, 30, has a career OPS+ of 106 across parts of eight MLB seasons. Last season, he had an OPS+ of 105 for the Reds. He has a career WAR of 10.8, and in 2023 he earned his first and to date only All-Star selection as a member of the Orioles. For his career, Hays boasts an OPS of .819 against left-handed pitching. Marlins sign FairbanksThe Marlins have agreed to terms on a one-year, $13 million free agent contract with veteran reliever Pete Fairbanks, the Athletic reports. \nThe 32-year-old Fairbanks has served as the Rays' closer for the last three seasons, and earlier in the offseason CBS Sports ranked him as the No. 40 free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"Fairbanks was a late addition to the free-agent class when the Rays surprisingly declined his club option. He's always struggled with durability (this past season marked his first time clearing 50 innings in a year) and his strikeout rate is a shadow of its old self. That said, Fairbanks continues to possess a nasty slider and he should slot into a high-leverage role for someone.\"The Marlins were in need of high-leverage relief help, especially after Ronny Henriquez was lost to Tommy John surgery. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The early returns on this rookie class have been nothing short of impressive. Just weeks into the season, first-year players across the league are already carving out meaningful roles, producing eye-catching stat lines and, in several cases, carrying their teams on a nightly basis. From top picks delivering star-level performances to less-heralded newcomers exceeding expectations, this group is quickly making a case as one of the strongest draft classes in recent memory. Below, we highlight 10 of the most impactful rookies so far, breaking down how each has translated their talent to the NBA level.Cooper Flagg, MavericksThe top pick of the draft has not disappointed one bit. He started off well with a 10-point, 10-rebound game in the season opener and averaged 16.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists over the first three games, with a high of 22 points in the third outing. His next season high came when he dropped 26 points, nine rebounds, and four assists on the Bucks in mid-November, which was then followed by a 29-point effort a couple of weeks later, and then a 35-point display in late-November versus the Clippers. From that point on, he has kept up an elevated rate of production, averaging 24.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists, one steal, and 1.3 blocks over the last 10 games, including a season-high 42-point outing against the Jazz in mid-December. Flagg looks ready and capable of helping to lead the way forward for the revamped Mavericks squad. Kon Knueppel, HornetsKnueppel was the fourth pick of the draft and took no time to show that he is the real deal, amassing 20 points on 7-for-12 shooting, including 5-for-9 from deep in just his third game. He followed up with 19 points in the next game, before delivering back-to-back five-point duds. He bounced back by hitting the 20-point mark in three straight games, capped with a 30-point effort against the Heat in early November. It took him just three more games to hit 30 points again, and he most recently reached a career high of 33 points. Knueppel is averaging 19.4 points on 47.4 percent shooting, including 41.9 percent from deep, and also hitting an impressive 89.5 percent from the foul line on the season. His overall play and achievements have already brought him into comparison with some of the best shooters in the league.VJ Edgecombe, 76ersThe third-overall pick, Edgecombe, took the league by storm by dropping 34 points on 13-for-26 shooting in his season debut. He continued the strong play and averaged 21.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.4 assists, and 1.2 steals through his first five games. He slowed down briefly but has since picked up his play again, averaging 22.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.6 assists over the last five games, including topping the 20-point mark in four straight. His 43.2 percent shooting from the field leaves room for improvement. However, he is hitting a hot 38.3 percent from deep, which adds to his dynamic presence and brings valuable dimension to the squad's offense, helping him maintain a starting role. \nDerik Queen, PelicansQueen got off to a quiet start, scoring in single digits in four of his first six games while playing out of a bench role. However, things took a turn after he delivered 26 points on 12-for-18 shooting in a mid-November outing. He earned his first start of the season two games later and has not looked back, averaging 15.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, one steal, and 0.9 blocks over 19 consecutive games as a starter. He has already reached the 30-point mark twice, including a triple-double with a season-high 33 points to go with 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Aside from his ability to score, the young big man is showing an impressive knack for handling the ball and shining as a playmaker. With a six-foot-nine, 250-pound frame, he has the tools to develop into one of the league's most uncontainable big men. Jeremiah Fears, PelicansIt only took Fears two games to earn himself the starting point-guard job, as he amassed a total of 30 points on 12-for-18 shooting through 47 minutes of play across the two appearances. He came up a bit flat in his first showing as a starter, but since then, he is averaging 15.3 points, 3.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.4 steals in 27.3 minutes per game over 28 games. He has reached the 20-point mark on seven occasions and has racked up at least five assists in six games, with a season high of eight assists. At just 19 years of age, Fears is showing great promise to emerge as one of the league's most intriguing young guards. Cedric Coward, GrizzliesCoward got straight to business, averaging 19 points, 3.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.7 steals in 22.7 minutes per game over his first three appearances, including a season-high 27 points in his third outing. He maintained solid production out of a bench role through the first 13 games before he took on a starting role that became available due to injuries in the lineup. He has done a good job with the increased responsibility, averaging 12.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists through 16 games as a starter, slowly solidifying a reputation as a well-rounded wing contributor, as he is averaging 1.4 made 3s per game and showing the ability to handle tough defensive matchups. \nRyan Kalkbrenner, HornetsKalkbrenner was granted a starting job to begin the season and stole the league's attention by averaging 11 points per game on incredible 90 percent shooting through his first five games. He has since slowed down but is still averaging 8.7 points on 78.7 percent shooting, which is on pace to lead the league. He also has recorded three games with double digits in rebounds, including two double-doubles. His knack for efficiency on the offensive side, combined with his average of 1.8 blocks per game, is a fantastic sign that he could grow into one of the league's more well-rounded centers. Dylan Harper, SpursThe second overall pick, Harper scored in double digits through his first six games, averaging 14 points, four rebounds, and 3.8 assists over that span, before going down with a calf injury that kept him out for just over two weeks. Nonetheless, he picked up where he left off, averaging 13.6 points, 2.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.1 steals through his first 10 games back in action, including a season-high 24-point effort. He has struggled scoring in the last few games, but has also showcased other aspects of his skillset, including delivering season highs of 10 assists and five steals in the last game. Harper is in an ideal situation, where he can grow as a key part of an impressive young core with the Spurs. Ryan Nembhard, MavericksNembhard had a slow start to the season, as he dealt with injury trouble that kept him sidelined through most of the first month of action. However, when he made his return in late November, he delivered seven assists with zero turnovers in 17 minutes off the bench. From there, he has started in 12 consecutive games, averaging 10.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, and seven assists over that span, including three games with at least 10 assists and a season high of 13. He is proving to be a well-disciplined playmaker and providing similar efficiency in his scoring, with a field-goal percentage of 48.5, including a blistering 41.3 percent from deep. \nAce Bailey, JazzBailey was the fifth pick of the draft. After a bit of a slow start, he is living up to the hype with three 20-point games under his belt already. He is averaging 12.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 0.9 steals over 20 games since taking on a starting role, and he is showing poise by shooting an efficient 46.8 percent from the field and 38.3 percent from deep over that span. At 6-foot-9, 200 pounds, he has great size for a wing player, especially considering that he is just 19 years old. Bailey should continue to flourish as part of a developing Jazz core.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a heated argument between Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and forward Draymond Green during the third quarter of Monday's game with the Orlando Magic, Green left the bench and headed for the locker room. On Wednesday, Kerr admitted that the situation was not his \"finest hour.\"Following the game, Kerr admitted that he and Green \"had it out a little bit.\" But claimed that the situation was private and that he wouldn't speak any more on the matter, though he changed his tune on Wednesday.  \"Monday night was not my finest hour, and that was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle,\" Kerr said after the Warriors' Wednesday practice. \"I regret my actions in that exchange. I apologized to [Green], he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team. \"These things, they happen -- especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So, over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"Green did return to the bench prior to the start of the fourth quarter, but did not re-enter the game, a contest that Golden State was leading 89-83 at the start of the final frame en route to a 120-97 victory.\nAs Kerr mentioned, he and Green have been together for 12 seasons, and while \"tempers spilled over,\" according to Green on Monday night, Kerr did not waver on his support for the veteran after the situation.\"There's a long history of that here because we understand each other, and I understand his power,\" Kerr said. \"There are four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it: I don't think we have any without him. That's how much he impacts winning. So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty.  \"We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize. So yeah, this is not totally uncommon. I would say this hasn't happened in a few years, this kind of a divide and a blow-up, but in our 12 years together, it's not the first time. And we've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result.\"\nThe Warriors (15-15) have won two straight games to get back to .500 and will host this year's top draft pick Cooper Flagg and the Dallas Mavericks (12-19) on Christmas at 5 p.m. ET.\n            ",

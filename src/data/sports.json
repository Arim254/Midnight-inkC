    "body": "\nThe Baltimore Ravens look to keep their slim playoff hopes alive when they battle the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night. The Ravens (7-8), who trail first-place Pittsburgh by two games in the AFC North, need to win out and have Pittsburgh lose to the Browns in Week 17 to make the playoffs. The Packers (9-5-1), who are 1.5 games behind Chicago for the NFC North lead, clinched a playoff spot on Thursday when the Vikings upset the Lions. Both teams have major question marks at quarterback. Green Bay QB Jordan Love (concussion/shoulder) is inactive, while backup Malik Willis (shoulder/illness) is active. Lamar Jackson (back) is inactive for Baltimore, putting Tyler Huntley in line to start. Kickoff from Lambeau Field in Green Bay is set for 8 p.m. ET. The Packers are 2.5-point favorites in the latest Ravens vs. Packers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 38 via DraftKings Sportsbook, a line that has dropped seven points from the opener due to the injuries.

Houston (9-3) is coming off a 31-24 victory over Baylor, and the 2025 Texas Bowl will take place 10 miles from its campus. The Tigers just defeated Baylor in last year's Texas Bowl, while this is the Cougars' first bowl of any kind since 2022. LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, who missed time late in the season with an abdominal injury, is among the LSU players who have opted out. Kickoff is at 9:15 p.m. ET from NRG Stadium in Houston. The Tigers lead the all-time series, 2-1. The Cougars are 1.5-point favorites in the latest Houston vs. LSU odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 41.5.

When the over/under is below 50 for the Cougars, the Over is 7-1. Additionally, UH has seen the Over hit in five of six games when favored this season. With the two quarterbacks forecasted to combine for over 500 total yards and nearly four total touchdowns, the Over is the better value.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins LSU vs. Houston, and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Houston vs. LSU spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

Stroud. Houston has the league's top defense, ranking first in both points allowed and yards allowed, and it's a defense that Justin Herbert knows all too well. In the Jan. 2025 playoff game between these teams, Houston picked off Herbert four times, which is one more pick than Herbert had in the entire 2024 regular season. Speaking of turnovers, the Texans have committed an NFL-low of five giveaways during their 10-2 run over their last dozen games, and they're on pace to be the first team in 17 years to not allow 250 passing yards in a game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverWhile the Texans have lost multiple games ATS during their winning streak, the same can't be said about L.A. which has covered in all four games of its four-game win streak. The Chargers have clinched a playoff spot, but they still has a huge incentive in front of them as they can get the No. 1 seed, and a bye, if they win out. Meanwhile, Los Angeles' defense has actually performed better than Houston's over the last two months as L.A. has given up a league-low of 254.5 total yards over the last eight games. The Chargers also have a big historical edge in regard to the spread, going 7-3 versus the line over their 10 all-time meetings. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Texans vs. Chargers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Chargers vs. Texans 10,000 times and is going Over on the total. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Texans vs. Chargers, and which side of the spread is the better value?

    "body": "\n        Chelsea had Aston Villa right where they wanted them, that was until Unai Emery's adjustments and brilliance from Ollie Watkins led the visitors to a 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Make no mistake, with this win is further proof that Villa are Premier League title contenders.  Not picking up their first league win of the season until the end of September, facing Fulham, Villa have been unstoppable since, racking up 13 consecutive wins in all competitions, despite defying the numbers even in this match. Chelsea may have only put three shots on goal, but they were able to generate 2.14 expected goals, most of which came from Joao Pedro's goal from close range in the first half. In the second half, Watkins, Jadon Sancho, and Amadou Onana entered, and it changed everything for Villa. They scored both their goals, outshot Chelsea 11-4 and also had an xG of 1.40 to 0.16. Changes like that come right down to tactics, and there are few better at preparing a team of perceived underdogs to be competitive in a match than Unai Emery.He's taken down Arsenal, Manchester City, and now Chelsea in order to draw within three points of the Gunners as we turn to the new year. The title race is very much on, and even Villa's numbers are beginning to improve as they have the fourth-best goal difference in the league, thanks to Emi Martinez and the defense allowing only 19 goals in 18 matches played this season. Scoring four goals while allowing two in their last two matches will do that, and it sets up quite a clash on the horizon. Villa can enter the new year top of the league if they can take down Arsenal again away at the Emirates Stadium on Dec. 30.All eyes would already be on that match with Emery facing a team that he formerly coached, but when Villa haven't won the league since 1981 before the Premier League was formed, and despite being an unlikely suspect outperforming their numbers on all fronts, it's time to take Villa seriously. They've already taken large strides upon returning to the Champions League for next season, opening a seven-point lead over fourth-place Liverpool with their win on Saturday. \nIt has been a true team effort, but after the defense, winger Morgan Rodgers taking a step forward has gone a long way to powering this team. With seven goals and three assists, he is also pushing to represent England at the World Cup in 2026 and is certainly on the right track. With an upcoming schedule including Arsenal and Crystal Palace, Villa's title credentials will continue to be tested during the upcoming stretch, but it's nothing that Emery won't have them prepared for. Despite that, Villa's manager is playing down their chances of winning the title, instead suggesting that his team are locked in a battle for fourth place.\"I am feeling that we are competing for Europe, not competing in the league with Man City and Arsenal,\" Emery said. \"We have played 18 matches and have 20 to play. Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United -- we must compete with them. We must be consistent over 38 matches.\"\nMaking sure that his team doesn't get ahead of themselves is something that makes sense, but even in a battle for Europe, Villa are in pole position. But numbers-wise, the title could be just beyond their reach.On one hand, only Tottenham have had a similar 10-goal overperformance of their xG, like Aston Villa, but considering their reliance on set plays, it makes sense as to why that would happen. This has become the league of set plays as teams have ensured that they make the most of every goal-scoring opportunity, but Emery was doing it before it became the rage. A manager doesn't coach four Europa League-winning sides without making the most of every opportunity, but if he's able to win the Premier League, it'd be the biggest trophy of his career to date.Villa are on track to do something special this season, and they have the leadership at the helm to get it done. With the January transfer window about to swing open, it's also a chance to add reinforcements for what could be a stretch run for the ages.\n            ",

His 216 yards were the fourth-most he's notched in a single game in his certain Hall of Fame career, and the first time the longtime Tennessee Titan put up 200 yards on a team other than the Houston Texans or Jacksonville Jaguars. And with Saturday night's effort, Henry's seventh 200-yard career game, he broke a three-way time with LaDainian Tomlinson and O.J. Simpson. That record came on Henry's last rushing attempt of the night, a 25-yard touchdown run that iced the game for Baltimore.But it wasn't Henry's only milestone of the night. Henry had already gone over 100 before halftime, passing former Dallas Cowboys great Tony Dorsett on the NFL's career rushing list to move into the top 10 with 12,892 yards. Henry, 31, has been steadily moving up the ranks on the all-time rushing list this season. Last month, Henry passed NFL legend Jim Brown against the Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving. He had passed Hall of Famers Franco Harris, Marcus Allen, Edgerrin James and Marshall Faulk earlier in the season.Henry is even higher up on the career list when it comes to scoring the ball. With his four touchdowns Saturday night, he moved past Adrian Peterson and into fourth-place in NFL history. Henry had 118 entering the game, and his two scores before halftime tied him with Petersen's 120. He tacked on two more in the second half and is now one behind Allen's 123. Dorsett (164) and Tomlinson (145) are the top two in that category.\nPer CBS Sports research, here are some of his other accomplishments on the night:Second player in NFL history with multiple games with 200+ rush yds and 4+ rush TD (Jim Brown)Most rush yards by a visitor at Packers all-time (4th with 200+ yds along with Gale Sayers, Walter Payton and Peterson)Tied for most rushing attempts (36) in a game in Ravens history (Bam Morris and Priest Holmes)Third-most rush yds in a game in Ravens history behind Jamal Lewis (295) and Priest Holmes (227)Third-oldest player in NFL history with 200-yard rushing game (John Henry Johnson and James Brooks)Most rushing attempts (36) by any player in a game this seasonMost rush TD (4) in a game in team historyEarned 45.6 fantasy points (third-most by RB in a game this season)Henry had the most rushing attempts (15) by any player on his team's first two drives of the game since former Denver Broncos running back Olandis Gary did it in 1999. Henry now has 25 games with at least 100 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, which is tied for the most in NFL history with Brown and Tomlinson.\nDuring his first season with the Ravens last year, Henry racked up 1,921 yards and 16 touchdowns, and he now has 1,469 yards and 16 touchdowns this season.NFL all-time rushing list PlayerRushing YardsEmmitt Smith18,355Walter Payton16,726Frank Gore16,000Barry Sanders15,269Adrian Peterson14,918Curtis Martin14,101LaDainian Tomlinson13,684Jerome Bettis13,662Eric Dickerson13,259Derrick Henry12,892Tony Dorsett12,739Jim Brown12,312Marshall Faulk12,279Edgerrin James12,246Marcus Allen12,243Franco Harris12,120Thurman Thomas12,074Fred Taylor11,695Steven Jackson11,438John Riggins11,352\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Williams said something to Alvarado who grabbed the Suns' big man and the two started going at it, with Alvarado throwing punches and connecting with a right hook. \nAlvarado and Williams were both ejected for their roles in the scrap, which was a far more legitimate fight than most tussles we see happen on an NBA court. The best part of it all was Jordan Poole's face in the background when Alvarado landed the punch (0:35 mark of the above video). \nAlvarado was still hot after getting pulled away and sprinted to the back, seemingly ready to continue things in the hallway by the locker rooms. He will likely be facing fairly stiff punishment from the NBA as the one to escalate things and connecting on a punch. Williams was less aggressive in his role in the brouhaha and will await the NBA's decision on whether he'll get further discipline than the ejection. \nThe Suns went on to win, 123-114, after the fight to notch back-to-back wins in New Orleans and improve to 18-13 on the season, as they battle for a playoff spot in the West. \n            \n    ",

An AFC West title is still on the table for the Chargers, who can knock off the Broncos in Week 18 by winning against the Texans on Saturday before facing the Denver Broncos in their final regular-season game.   This matchup stars two of the hottest teams in the NFL with Houston winning 10 of the last 12 games and Los Angeles ripping off a string of seven victories in the last eight games. The outcome  will be determined by which offense can prevail against either the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (the Texans, who are allowing 16.6 points per game) or the NFL's No. 8 scoring defense (the Chargers, who are allowing 20.1 points per game). Where to watch Chargers vs. TexansDate: Saturday, Dec. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers -1.5, O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nTexans vs. Chargers: Need to knowCan Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert evade the Texans' pass rush? The Texans are the NFL's best scoring defense (16.6 points per game allowed) and total defense (272.3 total yards per game allowed in 2025, and the last time they faced the Los Angeles Chargers, they threw quarterback Justin Herbert in a locker. Back in the 2024 AFC wild card round, the Texans coerced Herbert into four interceptions, and they sacked him four times in a 32-12 blowout loss. Herbert threw more interceptions than he did in the entire 2024 regular season (three).  This season with injuries to both starting tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, the Chargers quarterback has remained under siege: Herbert is being pressured on 42.4% of his dropbacks this season, the highest rate in the NFL. That's bad news facing Pro Bowl edge rusher Danielle Hunter, whose 9.0 sacks during Houston's seven-game winning streak are the second-most in the league in that span behind only NFL sacks leader Myles Garrett's 12.0 in that stretch. Hunter's 13.0 sacks overall this season are tied with Chargers edge rusher Tuli Tuipulotu for the third-most in the league. Just behind him is teammate Will Anderson Jr.'s 11.5 sacks, tied for the seventh-most in football. \nHerbert will have his hands full against the best pass rush duo in football. How will Texans QB C.J. Stroud handle Chargers' zone defense? Much of Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud's success this season has come against man coverage: he has completed 63.6% of his passes vs. man, the third-highest rate entering Week 17, with an average yards per pass attempt of 7.4, the eighth-most in the NFL entering Week 17. Stroud has thrown the most touchdowns without an interception, 13, against man coverage this season. However, he's been significantly worse against zone coverage this season: his 66.3% completion rate against zone is the ninth-lowest in the league entering Week 17 with only three touchdowns and all six of his interceptions. The Chargers run zone on 82.9% of their defensive plays, the second-highest rate in football. Los Angeles' 17 interceptions as a team are tied for the third-most in the NFL with the Texans, and 14 of them have come in zone coverage. Chargers rookie RB Omarion Hampton could be X factorOne way to slow down an opposing pass rush is a strong running game, and the return of Hampton from an early-season ankle injury could be the difference for Herbert and the Chargers in this matchup against the Texans. Hampton has forced a missed tackle on 32.7% of his carries, the highest rate in the NFL and the only figure above 30% among running backs with at least 100 carries, per NFL Pro. Texans vs. Chargers prediction, pickChargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston rediscovered his TCU form (104 yards and a touchdown on four catches) in Week 16 in a 34-17 domination of the Dallas Cowboys.  Hampton seems to be operating at full tilt after an efficient 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries -- 5.3 yards per carry --- last week. The Texans' defense will have to respect Hampton, which will allow Herbert to have he wasn't able to against Houston a year ago when dropping back to pass, particularly on play-action. That will lead to the Chargers exacting revenge for their postseason disappointment last year. \nPick: Chargers 24, Texans 20 | (Los Angeles -1.5, Over 39.5)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State coach Tom Izzo expressed more concern about college basketball's future following Baylor landing former 2023 NBA Draft pick James Nnaji. It represents an unprecedented move after his multiple professional years in Europe. Nnaji, who never signed an NBA contract, most recently played with Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey on loan from Spain's FC Barcelona. He averaged 7.5 and 4.0 rebounds with Yukatel Merkezefendi. Nnaji and Barcelona mutually agreed to part ways after the 2024-25 season before he played with the Knicks in the 2025 Summer League.Now, Baylor and coach Scott Drew get an immediately eligible 21-year-old 7-footer to help fill the frontcourt void left by injuries to Juslin Bodo Bodo (arm) and Maikcol Perez (ACL).\"Now we're taking guys that were drafted in the NBA and everything?,\" Izzo said. \"I said it to you a month and a half ago – c'mon Magic (Johnson) and Gary (Harris), let's go baby, let's do it. Why not? I mean, if that's what we're going to, shame on the NCAA. Shame on the coaches, too. But shame on the NCAA, because coaches are gonna do what they gotta do, I guess. But the NCAA is the one. Those people on those committees that are making those decisions to allow something so ridiculous and not think of the kid.\"So everybody talks about me thinking of my program or I'm selfish. No. Get that straight, for all of you. I'm thinking of, what is best for my son if he was in that position? And I just don't agree with it.\"\nIzzo said he would like to \"poll 360 coaches\" and see how many agreed with this ruling in favor of Baylor. Izzo previously ripped transfer portal culture in August.\"Write this one down: It's gonna get me,\" Izzo said. \"I'm just not gonna let it bother me. But it's gonna get me sooner or later. Sooner or later, it's gonna get me. Not that I'm too stubborn not to ever do anything.\"Izzo later directed his criticism toward NCAA president Charlie Baker, though he didn't mention him by name.\n\"What we've done in the NCAA has been an absolute travesty to me,\" Izzo said. \"We're just worried about getting sued and we're not gonna fight anybody. And I think leadership means you fight and you make decisions that are sometimes unpopular.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There were plenty of reasons why the Los Angeles Chargers lost to the Houston Texans on Saturday, but the most shocking one was the fact that Cameron Dicker had the first meltdown of his career.The Chargers kicker cost his team four points with a missed 32-yard field goal and a missed extra point in the 20-16 loss. Dicker missing two short kicks in one game might have been the most statistically improbable kicking meltdown the NFL has ever seen. Going into Week 17, Dicker had made 94.1% of his field goal attempts, which makes him the most accurate kicker in NFL history (No other kicker is even at 90%). Dicker had never missed two kicks in one game in his entire career, but that changed against Houston. The first miss came with just under 20 seconds left to play in the first half. After Elijah Molden came up with a huge interception, that set the Chargers up with the ball in Houston territory. The Chargers drive eventually came to an end at Houston's 14-yard line and that's when Dicker was sent out for a 32-yard field goal, a kick that's usually automatic for him. And when we say automatic, we mean automatic: Going into Saturday's game, Dicker had NEVER missed a field goal from inside 40 yards in his career (He was 68 of 68). But then that streak came to a sudden end. \nThe kick would have cut Houston's lead to 14-6, but with the miss, the Texans went into halftime with a 14-3 lead.  \nThe only thing more stunning then Dicker's field goal miss was his missed extra point, which came with just over three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. After a 5-yard touchdown run by Omarion Hampton cut the lead to 20-16, Dicker had a chance to trim the lead to just three points, but instead, he shanked the extra point.\nGoing into that kick, Dicker had made 57 straight extra points in the regular season. It's impossible to say how the game would have played out if Dicker made both of those kicker, but it's very possible that the Chargers would have taken the Texans to overtime. \nLet's to a quick recap of Dicker's stunning meltdown: He missed two kicks in a game for the FIRST time in his careerHe missed a field goal from inside 40 yards for the first time in his careerHe only had two misses all season on 71 kicks (Field goals and extra points) going into Week 17His streak of 57 straight successful extra points came to an endAnd all of this happened to a kicker who was just voted to the Pro Bowl last week as the AFC's kicker. Dicker had only missed a total of two kicks ALL season, which is why he got the Pro Bowl nod. Going into Week 17, he was 36 of 38 on field goals this year, including 19 of 19 from inside 40, and he was 33 of 33 on extra points. The only good news for the Chargers is that they've already clinched a playoff spot, so Dicker will likely get a chance to redeem himself in the postseason. With the Chargers' loss, the Broncos clinched the AFC West, which means L.A. could be in spot to rest its starters in Week 18 against Denver. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Texans' 20-16 win over the Chargers on Saturday night to improve to 11-5, Houston clinched a spot in the playoffs, eliminating the 8-7 Colts in the process. Indianapolis becomes just the sixth team in NFL history to start a season 8-2 and miss the playoffs and the first to do so since the 1995 Raiders. That's not the kind of history any team hopes to make, and it underscores what a disaster the second half of the season has been for Indianapolis. They began the season as the NFL's best story, with Daniel Jones getting a redemption arc with a fresh start in Indy, leading an offense that was the best in the league. With the playoffs firmly in their sights and an AFC lacking a dominant force, the Colts understandably took a swing at the trade deadline, shipping two first round picks to the Jets for star corner Sauce Gardner. However, things went off the rails for Indianapolis shortly after the trade deadline, leaving the franchise and its fans worried about its immediate future. Jones was hobbled with a fractured fibula, Gardner got injured early in his third game in Indy and Jones eventually tore his Achilles to end his season. As injuries have piled up, the Colts have lost their last five games, the last two coming with 44-year-old Philip Rivers playing quarterback after he signed with the teams after being retired for nearly five years. \nIt has been the ultimate disaster scenario for Indy. Losing Jones to a catastrophic injury leads to questions about whether he'll be the short or long-term answer at quarterback. However, with the Jets owning their 2026 (and 2027) first-round pick from the Gardner trade, they won't even have the option of taking a swing in April's NFL Draft. It's an unfortunate situation, especially because we so rarely see teams truly try to capitalize on a surprising seasons. The Colts took a huge swing and struck out, and now will serve as a cautionary tale for future front offices wondering if it's worth doing the same. It being the Texans that eliminated them officially only adds salt to the wound in Indy. Not only are the Texans division rivals, but Houston makes a bit of history themselves by becoming just the seventh team to make the postseason after an 0-3 start. The last team to do it? The 2018 Texans. \nThe Colts will play a key role in exactly where Houston ends up in the AFC seeding. The Colts finish the season against the Jaguars in Week 17 and the Texans in Week 18, with Houston needing a win over Indy next week and a Jacksonville loss against either the Colts or Titans in the final two weeks to win the AFC South. \n            ",

The going won't get any easier in Week 17, as Jackson is officially inactive for Baltimore against the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night.Jackson did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday and then was listed as doubtful on Friday. With Jackson sidelined, Tyler Huntley will get the start as the Ravens must win out and the Pittsburgh Steelers must lose out in order for Baltimore to make the playoffs.The Ravens reached the postseason the last three seasons but haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know this year. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later. Previously, Jackson was 16-0.Jackson, the two-time MVP, was injured in the second quarter against the Patriots on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from safety Craig Woodson. \nJackson, who struggled to walk out of the locker room after the game, admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game. \"It's BS, bro,\" Jackson said. \"I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.\"Jackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Huntley replaced Jackson under center and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.\n\"My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,\" Jackson said. \"Pain. It hurts. [It] hurts.\"\n            \n    ",

Richards has already been ruled out for Palace's match against Tottenham on Sunday by manager Oliver Glasner, who didn't give a timetable for Richards' return, but he did note that Richards could be back for their game on New Year's Day. How to watch Crystal Palace vs. Tottenham, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 11:30 a.m.Location: Selhurst Park -- LondonTV: USA Odds: Crystal Palace +120; Draw +230; Tottenham +240But Richards is optimistic, saying that it \"won't be long\" until he's back in the fold for Palace.\"Thanks everybody for the messages, won't be long till I'm back,\" Richards wrote on Instagram.\nNot only is that something positive for Palace fans, but it's also important for Mauricio Pochettino and the United States men's national team. Tyler Adams will be out for 2-3 months after tearing his MCL for Bournemouth against Manchester United, and an injury to more key members of his first-choice XI would be a speed bump in preparation for the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Richards and the 38-year-old Tim Ream are the clear top defenders for the USMNT, and with their best performances for Pochettino coming in a back three, losing a starting defender would be a massive blow to depth. Richards has become a critical piece of the Palace defense and one of the first names on the teamsheet as he grows as a defender under Glasner. \nTaking part in the Europa Conference League, Palace have quite a run of matches in their future, and they'll also want their backline to be in top shape when those are coming over the horizon. After facing Tottenham on Sunday, Palace will play four games in 10 days from Jan. 1-10 before getting back to a standard schedule.\n            \n    ",

The Packers, with some help from their division rival Minnesota Vikings on Christmas, clinched a playoff berth when the Detroit Lions were eliminated. Meanwhile, the Ravens need a win simply to stay in the running.The Packers (9-5-1) blew yet another late lead in an eventual 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears in Week 16, and making matters worse, starting quarterback Jordan Love left early with a concussion and will not play Saturday night. However, the Packers should take comfort in having Malik Willis under center. He performed admirably last week after taking over for Love (9-for-11 passing, 121 yards, one touchdown; 44 rushing yards) and has done so in the past as well.The Ravens also blew a late lead in a 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots, a game Lamar Jackson exited in the second quarter with a back injury and did not return. Jackson, who has dealt with a bevy of injuries this season, has also been ruled out. Baltimore will once again turn the keys over to Tyler Huntley. Huntley went 9-for-10 for 65 yards relieving Jackson and also won his lone start this season, back in Week 8 against the Bears.\nBelow, you'll find information on how to watch this game, plus betting information, keys to the game and a prediction.Where to watch Packers vs. Ravens liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 27 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Lambeau Field -- Green Bay, WisconsinStream: PeacockFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers -4.5, O/U 40.5 (via DraftKings)\nPackers vs. Ravens: Need to knowPlayoff significance for both. The Packers are looking at an uphill battle to win the NFC North, but they are at least in the tournament. The Ravens, on the other hand, have to win their final two games of the season and have the Pittsburgh Steelers lose both of their final two games. The Steelers face the Cleveland Browns on Sunday before hosting the Ravens in Week 18.Can Derrick Henry deliver? It's been a down season for Henry. After 2,114 yards from scrimmage last year, he has 1,403 this season -- still a huge number, but not close to his 2024 totals. Furthermore, Henry has had three lost fumbles, all in one-possession losses. Last week, the Ravens scored on their opening drive and were driving again when Henry coughed up the ball. The Packers can have some struggles against physical run games, though, and there's no one better to lead that charge than Henry.Packers defense must bounce back. In Week 15 against the Denver Broncos, the Packers gave up 391 yard, at the time their most allowed since Week 4. Then last week, they allowed 400 yards against the Bears. The Broncos threw for 302 yards; the Bears ran for 150. Without Micah Parsons, Devonte Wyatt and others, Green Bay has taken a step back in both facets.Packers vs. Ravens prediction, pickThe Ravens have their backs against the wall. The Packers are in and have the NFC North title still in their sights. The Packers are simply the better team -- more talented, more disciplined -- and if the teams have to go to their backups, Willis has played at a higher level than Huntley.\nPick: Packers 23, Ravens 17 | (Green Bay -4.5, Under 40.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Helmed by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and shorthand for TMRW Golf League, the simulator golf experience will present 15 regular-season matches contested by six teams across three months.The SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, remains host as all 15 matches and the playoffs will air on television nationally in the same broadcast windows it held during the first campaign. That's not to say the entire schedule is identical, though. The Presidents Day tripleheader that made headlines a year ago will not be held, and the showdown between Woods' Jupiter Links Golf Club and McIlroy's Boston Common Golf is set for Sunday, March 1 -- following the conclusion fo the PGA Tour's Congizant Classic hosted in the same city.The postseason is set for the weeks following The Tour Championship with TGL ultimately ceding way to the PGA Tour as major championship season kicks into high gear.Let's take a look at what's ahead for TGL in 2026 along with the rules of play and how the teams are comprised.\n 2026 TGL schedule All times Eastern MatchDateTimeTVMatch / Results1 \t\t\t\tSun., Dec. 28 \t\t\t\t3 p.m. \t\t\t\tABC \t\t\t\tNew York vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t2 \t\t\t\tFri., Jan. 2 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tBoston vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t3 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 6 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t4 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 13 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter Links vs. New York \t\t\t\t5 \t\t\t\tTues., Jan. 20 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter Links vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t6 \t\t\t\tMon., Jan. 26 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tBoston vs. The Bay \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 2 \t\t\t\t5 p.m.  \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tAtlanta vs. Jupiter Links \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 9 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Los Angeles \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 23 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tAtlanta vs. Boston \t\t\t\t10 \t\t\t\tMon., Feb. 23 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tLos Angeles vs. Atlanta \t\t\t\t11 \t\t\t\tTues., Feb. 24 \t\t\t\t5 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tNew York vs. The Bay \t\t\t\t12 \t\t\t\tTues., Feb. 24 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tBoston vs. New York \t\t\t\t13 \t\t\t\tSun., Mar. 1 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tJupiter vs. Boston \t\t\t\t14 \t\t\t\tMon., Mar. 2 \t\t\t\t7 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2 \t\t\t\tLos Angeles vs. New York \t\t\t\t15 \t\t\t\tTues., Mar. 3 \t\t\t\t9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tThe Bay vs. Jupiter \t\t\t\tSemi 1Semi 2 \t\t\t\tTues., Mar. 17 \t\t\t\t6:30 p.m.9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\tFinals 1Finals 2Finals 3 \t\t\t\tMon., Mar. 23Tues., Mar. 24Tues., Mar. 24 \t\t\t\t9 p.m.7 p.m.9 p.m. \t\t\t\tESPN2ESPNESPN \t\t\t\tTBD \t\t\t\t TGL format TGL matches take place across 15 holes and two sessions. Players hit full-swing shots off grass, rough or sand platforms into a simulator screen. Short-game shots under 50 yards and putts take place inside the SoFi Center on a rotating, adjustable green.Holes Nos. 1-9 -- Triples (3 vs. 3 alternate shot): Two teams of three face off with a three-man rotation hitting one shot at a time for each team. That rotation continues, in order, until the hole is completed.Holes Nos. 10-15 -- Singles (head-to-head play): A golfer from one team will play a hole against a golfer from the other team. All three players will play a hole, one by one, before the cycle begins again on hole Nos. 13-15.Overtime: 3 vs. 3 closet-to-the-pin competition Scoring: Each hole is worth one point. Ties are worth zero points. There are no carryovers. The Hammer: Each hole in a TGL match is worth one point unless a team decides to throw the \"hammer\" (not an actual hammer), a yellow weighted flag that doubles the point value of that hole. A team can either accept the hammer and play that hole for two points or deny it and concede the hole. Each team has three hammers to use throughout the match. Shot clock: Players will have 40 seconds to hit their shots or face a one-stroke penalty. Timeouts: Each team has four timeouts per match -- two in Triples and two in Singles. There are no carryovers from session to session.

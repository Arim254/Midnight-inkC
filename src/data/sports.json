Chicago is plus-21 in that regard, while the second-place team is at just plus-15. Chicago has forced the most turnovers (31) and it has committed the second-fewest (10). When the Niners lose the turnover battle this season, they are just 3-4 against the spread. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the 49ers can coverRiding a five-game win streak, San Francisco leads the NFL in points per game, points per drive and 3rd-down offense during this run, and each of the five victories have come by double-digits. The offense has been unstoppable over the last two games in particular, as the Niners are just the fifth team in the last 75 years to go back-to-back outings without punting the ball. Though he doesn't qualify for statistical leaderboards due to time missed, Brock Purdy leads the NFL in QBR and is among the top five in touchdown percentage, completion percentage and passer rating.

So, the likes of Jaylen Warren, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Stefon Diggs may find themselves a bit higher in the Week 17 Fantasy football projections than expected. Some NFL injuries of note to consider for Fantasy include Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel), Chris Olave (back) and Drake London (knee), all of whom are listed as questionable.Before setting your Week 17 Fantasy football lineups for championship matchups, be sure to check out the Week 17 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 17 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking.

Thomas, who is owned in almost all leagues being started in nearly half of them, has been a top-25 Fantasy receiver over the last three weeks, but this has been his best stretch all season as inconsistency has defined his sophomore year. He had a season-low of 18 yards last week, as both Parker Washington and Jakobi Meyers have passed Thomas in the eyes of Trevor Lawrence, as those two are averaging more receptions and yards over the last month. Thomas may not warrant a spot in Week 17 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in wide receiver rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Rams tight end Colby Parkinson, despite him being the TE22 on the season and being started in just 38% of leagues this week. Parkinson has quietly performed as the TE6 since Week 10 as he's made the most of Tyler Higbee going on injured reserve. The former has six touchdowns over his last seven games while averaging 35.9 receiving yards over this stretch. He should continue that success on Monday night versus a Falcons defense which just allowed 11 catches and 118 yards to the tight end position on Sunday, which came a week after giving up a tight end touchdown.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl season has already seen 24 games completed, in addition to four playoff matchups. But some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are over a dozen matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 14.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday. The spread dropped one point after the announcement that Kyle Whittingham would depart for Michigan before this game. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Vanderbilt (-4.5) vs. Iowa, USC vs. TCU (+6.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5), Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5) and Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest (+3.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Texas State (-11.5) handles Rice in the Armed Forces Bowl at 1 p.m. ET on Jan. 2 in a matchup of Lone Star State foes. The Bobcats bounced back from a five-game losing streak to win their last three on the way to claim bowl eligibility. Rice, meanwhile, went 5-7 and only got eligibility because there weren't enough .500 teams. The Owls lost six of their final eight games. SportsLine's model projects that Texas State wins 75% of the time, making the Bobcats the clear side to back in confidence pools. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are several teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as plenty of underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

Utah was expected to have head coach Kyle Whittingham for one more game, but his decision to take the Michigan job changed those plans, leaving the Utes to scramble with just days to go before the matchup. Dylan Raiola (injury/portal) is out for Nebraska, but freshman TJ Lateef got some quality experience late in the season and should be able to keep Nebraska within this big number. SportsLine's model projects that this will be a one-score game as Nebraska covers well over 60% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here, and bet on Nebraska here: \nAnother prediction: Mississippi State (-3.5, 53.5) covers against Wake Forest in the Duke's Mayo Bowl on Jan. 2, which is the final bowl game of the 2025-26 season at 8 p.m. ET. The Bulldogs were 5-7 this year, but got the invitation because there weren't enough .500 teams available. MSU's roster is relatively intact, while Wake Forest has lost some key pieces to the transfer portal and isn't expected to have star running back Demond Claiborne after he declared for the NFL Draft.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n         Mavericks' star Anthony Davis is likely to undergo surgery for ligament damage in his left hand, according to ESPN. Davis had been out for the past two games for Dallas, seeking multiple opinions on if surgery was needed for the injury. He sustained the injury during Dallas' 116-114 loss to the Utah Jazz last week, when his hand got caught in Lauri Markkanen's jersey while defending him under the basket.When the injury occurred, Davis immediately began grabbing at his hand in pain and came out of the game. He walked back to the locker room, but paused for a moment in the tunnel doubled over in pain.\nWhen the Mavericks traveled to Chicago to face the Bulls on Saturday, Davis was seen in a sling with his hand heavily wrapped. With surgery expected, this would sideline Davis for the next few months, and could potentially be the end of his season.\nIt could also be the end of his time with the Mavericks, as Charania reports that Dallas still plans to make him available on the trade market leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline. Given Davis' current injured status, as well as his hefty contract and lengthy injury history, determining what team would be willing to take the risk to take him on is difficult.There was thought that the Hawks could make a run at Davis, especially after they traded Trae Young to the Wizards, which makes them able to take on the $54.1 million Davis is owed this season. But now that he'll be undergoing surgery, Atlanta probably isn't on the list of incredibly short teams that have interest in the All-NBA forward.\nIf there is a team out there who still wants Davis, the Mavericks will have to sell low on the big man. That's a consequence of trading for an oft-injured player who hasn't been able to stay on the floor long enough to rebuild his trade value. The Raptors have been linked to Davis in the past, so too have the Bulls and Warriors at one point or another. But at this point, it would be more shocking for Davis to be traded before the deadline than to see him suit up for the Mavericks again this season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        This past weekend, the Chicago Cubs made their biggest free-agent splash in quite some time, landing third baseman Alex Bregman with a five-year contract worth $175 million. There are $70 million in deferrals, which push the average annual value down to $31 million or so for competitive balance tax purposes. Money aside, it's an enormous move for the Cubbies. Bregman gives the Cubs more infielders than infield spots. Dansby Swanson and Bregman, the No. 1 and 2 picks in the 2015 Draft, are entrenched on the left side of the infield, leaving Nico Hoerner and Matt Shaw for second base. Hoerner has been a stalwart over the last six years. Shaw, a natural shortstop, was a Gold Glove finalist at third base as a rookie last season. Hoerner has drawn trade interest since long before the Bregman signing, and things have only picked up since then. The New York Yankees checked in on Hoerner recently, per the New York Post. The San Francisco Giants and Seattle Mariners have also been connected to him this winter, and surely other clubs as well. Hoerner has an awful lot of fans within the game. \"Everybody has their own intangible qualities.  Nico is great at some --  really things that I think other people think they're good at, and  they're not as good at it,\" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said at the Winter Meetings. \"... In a sport like baseball, with so many games and so many  moments, it shows up a lot.  And I think it's a great trait to have, and  it's what made Nico a very good baseball player.\" \nHoerner, 29 in May, joins outfielders Ian Happ and Seiya Suzuki and starters Shota Imanaga and Jameson Taillon as core Cubs players scheduled to become free agents after 2026. This coming season very well might be the last run for this group of players, and the best possible Cubs team this coming season has Bregman at third and Hoerner at second, with Shaw in a utility role. That said, Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer would not be doing his job if he didn't at least listen to offers for Hoerner (or Shaw). There is a lot -- A LOT -- of interest around the league and an offer could come across that's just too good to pass up, even if it makes the 2026 Cubs worse on the field. It never hurts to listen even if you don't want to move the player (and the Cubs do want to keep Hoerner). Why is Hoerner such a popular trade target? Why would the Cubs move him? Where could he end up? Let's break down Hoerner's place in the trade rumor mill with spring training a month away. \n Why do teams want him? Because he's an excellent player, simply put. Hoerner may not give you even 10 home runs -- hitting for power just isn't his skill set -- but he's excellent at just about everything else. He's an elite contact hitter, an elite defender, and a top-of-the-line baserunner. He's also a tough, hard-nosed player with a reputation for being a leader in the clubhouse. It's great performance and great intangibles. Last year, Hoerner put up his fourth straight season in the 4 WAR range (that's All-Star level production), something only 16 other players have done league-wide. His standout skill offensively is his contact ability. Here's where Hoerner ranked among the 145 qualified hitters in various contact metrics in 2025:  HoernerMLB averageStrikeout rate \t\t\t\t7.6% (3rd in MLB) \t\t\t\t22.2% \t\t\t\tSwinging strike rate \t\t\t\t4.9% (7th in MLB) \t\t\t\t11.0% \t\t\t\tIn-zone contact rate \t\t\t\t95.8% (3rd in MLB) \t\t\t\t85.4% \t\t\t\tIn an era of high strikeout rates, Hoerner is one of the best in the game at getting the bat on the ball, and he does it against all pitch types. Fastballs, breaking balls, changeups, whatever. Hoerner also uses the entire field and has a knack for making his hardest contact on a line rather than pounding the ball into the ground like many other high-contact hitters. Defensively, Hoerner is a shortstop playing second base in deference to Swanson. He's a two-time Gold Glover at second, including last year, and the Cubs typically put him at short whenever Swanson is out of the lineup. Hoerner grades out well there and would play shortstop for more than a few teams around the league (I suspect, in fact, that there's trade interest in him as a shortstop). Bottom line, Hoerner is a winning player who helps his team at a very high level in so many ways. He gives you tough at-bats and balls in play, he's a vacuum in the field, he runs the bases smart and aggressively, and he posts up every game. Hoerner is the kind of player who allows everyone in the organization to put their head down at night and sleep well knowing he's on the roster.  Why would the Cubs move him? A good question, this is, because it would make little on-field sense to do it. The best version of the 2026 Cubs has Hoerner at second base alongside Swanson and Bregman, not Shaw. If the goal is winning the NL Central and ultimately the World Series this coming season, then you keep Hoerner and take everything he gives his team when he's in the lineup. I see two possible reasons the Cubs could trade Hoerner. I'm not saying these are good reasons, just reasons. 1. They want to avoid CBT. Bregman put the Cubs just under the $244 million competitive balance tax threshold, according to both Cot's Baseball Contracts and FanGraphs. Realistically, the Cubs will go over the threshold this year. They'll have to make injury call ups throughout the season and those players count toward the CBT. Trading Hoerner and his $12 million salary would be a quick and easy way to clear payroll, create some CBT breathing room, and get back talent. 2. They get a monster offer. An offer they can't refuse, basically. I have a hard time seeing this because, as good as Hoerner is, he is a year away from free agency and teams will trade only so much for one year of a player (especially one with limited power). The best case trade package probably looks like what the Cubs gave up for one year of Kyle Tucker last offseason (Isaac Paredes, Cam Smith, Hayden Wesneski) and I'm just not sure that's out there. The Cubs went over the CBT threshold ever so slightly in 2024, though they have generally avoided it the last few years. My guess is they're willing to go a few million over again this year because a) they want to win, and b) they have a lot of money coming off the books after the season, so they can swallow a small CBT tax bill given the financial flexibility that's on the horizon. That's really it though. The only reasons to trade Hoerner are financial (a bad reason) or because you get overwhelmed with an offer (a good reason). Even then, the shape of that trade package matters. Are you getting MLB players in return? Prospects? A trade that weakens the 2026 Cubs but improves the farm system may not be the best move for them at this point in time.  Which teams could be interested? As good as Hoerner is, the fact he's a year away from free agency means only contenders will show interest in him. A rebuilding team couldn't trade for him and count on him hanging around until they return to contention, even if they intend to make him an extension offer. Here, listed alphabetically, are seven teams that make the most sense for Hoerner. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boston Red Sox: Bregman's former team now has openings at second and third base, though young Marcelo Mayer figures to slot in at one of those positions. Getting Hoerner to play second base would significantly improve the team's infield defense, which was a major issue at times last year (especially on the right side of the field). He would also bring balance to a lineup that leans a little too left-handed at the moment. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Guardians: Cleveland's projected 2026 payroll currently sits about $24 million south of their 2025 payroll, according to FanGraphs. Their middle infield situation is not great (Gabriel Arias and Brayan Rocchio), and the Guardians could easily slide Hoerner over to shortstop when second baseman Travis Bazzana, the No. 1 pick in the 2024 Draft, is ready. That could be as soon as Opening Day. The Guardians need an offensive boost and the AL Central is winnable.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Tigers: The Javier Báez resurgence was fun while it lasted, though it didn't last very long (.528 OPS after June 22). Trey Sweeney hasn't distinguished himself in his MLB time either. Hoerner is an obvious fit for a Tigers team that may not have Tarik Skubal beyond 2026. They should do everything they can to maximize this season, and making a trade for Hoerner and putting him at shortstop fits the \"win while we have Skubal\" plan perfectly. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Dodgers: The two-time defending World Series champions need an outfielder more than an infielder, though Tommy Edman's versatility would allow them to put Hoerner at second and Edman in the outfield (or just move the latter around as a super utility guy). Trading Hoerner to a team you'll likely have to go through to win the National League pennant would be a tough sell for the Cubs. It might take an outsized trade package for Los Angeles to swing it. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Yankees: Anthony Volpe will miss the start of the season following shoulder surgery and, frankly, hasn't done anything to suggest he deserves the shortstop job without a fight. Trading for Hoerner would add a needed high-contact righty bat to the lineup and also plug the shortstop hole early in the season. What happens when Volpe returns? The Yankees can worry about that when it happens and not a moment sooner.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco Giants: Hoerner would be a tremendous fit for a Giants team that could push for a wild-card spot in 2026. They have several ground ball-reliant starters (Adrian Houser, Landen Roupp, Logan Webb) who would love having Hoerner play behind them. Also, his high-contact, spray-the-ball-around approach would mix nicely with spacious Oracle Park. On the field, Hoerner is an excellent fit the Giants and the Giants appear to be an excellent fit for Hoerner. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Mariners: The Mariners reportedly want to leave lanes clear for their young infielders (Colt Emerson and Cole Young, most notably), but their AL West and World Series window is wide open. Hoerner would improve the 2026 Mariners quite a bit and, because he's a one-year rental, he wouldn't block Emerson and/or Young long-term either. Seattle's payroll is still a bit below its 2025 level. The Mariners should have money to spend and motivation to improve. What's next?My hunch, and I emphasize this is just a hunch, is the Cubs will keep Hoerner because they know keeping him is their best chance to win in 2026. They'll listen to offers because hey, why not? It never hurts to listen. The Cubs do love Hoerner though. He's a great player and a clubhouse leader and I'm not sure any trade offers will come their way that reflect how much they value him. Hoerner is constantly in trade rumors because teams want him, not because the Cubs want to move him. Signing Bregman only to turn around and trade Hoerner, almost certainly for financial reasons rather than baseball reasons, would be nonsensical. The Cubs signed Bregman to add him to Hoerner, not replace him. For now though, teams continue to ask about him and try to pry him loose. I don't think a trade will happen, though the chances a trade does happen definitely aren't 0%. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For just the fourth time since 1969, the Pittsburgh Steelers will be looking for a new coach. Longtime coach Mike Tomlin has agreed to step down from his post in Pittsburgh, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Jonathan Jones. Tomlin's decision signals the end of a 19-year run in Pittsburgh as the longest tenured coach in the league.In 2024, Steelers president Art Rooney II extended Tomlin's contract while exuding confidence that Tomlin would get the franchise back to winning playoff games. Since that extension, the Steelers have lost two more playoff games while extending their drought without a playoff win to nine seasons. \"During our meeting today, coach Tomlin informed me that he has decided to step down as our head coach,\" Rooney said in a statement. \"Obviously, I am extremely grateful to Mike for all the hard work, dedication and success we shared over the last 19 years. It is hard for me to put into words the level of respect and appreciate I have for coach Tomlin. He guided the franchise to our sixth Super Bowl championship and made the playoffs 13 times during his tenure, including winning the AFC North eight times in his career. His track record of never having a losing season in 19 years will likely never be duplicated. \"My family and I, and everyone connected to Steelers management, are forever grateful for the passion and dedication Mike Tomlin has devoted to Steelers football.\"\nTomlin, 53, served as the Steelers' coach from 2007-25. He won a Super Bowl during his second season (becoming the youngest head coach to do so at the time), guided the Steelers to another Super Bowl appearance during his fourth season. Tomlin then made NFL history by becoming the first coach to begin his career with 19 consecutive non-losing seasons. This past season, Tomlin tied former Steelers Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll with 193 regular season wins, the ninth-highest total in league history. Including the postseason, Tomlin won 201 games during his nearly two-decade long run with the Steelers. He also led the Steelers to their eighth AFC North division titles that included this past season after Pittsburgh went 10-7.Tomlin's ability to consistently churn out competitive teams is unrivaled, but his teams have struggled of late in the postseason. After winning five of his first six playoff games, Tomlin went just 3-11 in his final 14 playoff games in Pittsburgh. He joined Bengals coach Marvin Lewis as the only two coaches in history to lose seven consecutive postseason games after the Steelers lost to the Texans in this year's AFC wild card round. \nPittsburgh was largely outplayed in each of those losses. Of those seven losses, six were of double-digit variety. In the one outlier (a 45-42 loss to the Jaguars in the 2017 divisional round), the Steelers trailed 28-7 before mounting an unsuccessful rally that included a touchdown with one second remaining that made the final score closer than the game actually was. Lack of stability at the quarterback position was one of Pittsburgh's major issues during Tomlin's final seasons with the team. Following Ben Roethlisberger's retirement at the end of the 2021 season, the Steelers had six different starting quarterbacks. And while each one had pockets of success, they were unable to take the Steelers to the next level in terms of winning a playoff game and making a serious run at a Super Bowl. As noted above, the Steelers have had just three head coaches since 1969: Noll, Tomlin and Bill Cowher, whose 15 years in Pittsburgh resulted in a Hall of Fame induction in 2021. Tomlin will likely join his predecessors in Canton, Ohio sometime down the road. \nAs far as the Steelers' next coach, the Steelers have historically hired first-time coaches who had had success as assistant coaches while working alongside some of the best head coaches. Noll served on Don Shula's staff before getting the Steelers' job, and Cowher was mentored by Marty Schottenheimer (who is eighth on the all-time wins list) before he came to Pittsburgh in 1992. Tomlin was a position coach under both Tony Dungy and Jon Gruden and won a Super Bowl as a member of the 2002 Buccaneers' coaching staff. He then had a successful stint as the Vikings' defensive coordinator before being hired by then-Steelers owner Dan Rooney in 2007. Whoever is the Steelers' next coach will not only have the tall task in following in those coaches' footsteps, he will also be charged with snapping the franchise's drought without a playoff win, which dates back to the 2016 season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Scoot over Kevin Stefanski and Klint Kubiak, there's a new most sought-after coach in the 2026 NFL coaching carousel: John Harbaugh. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 seasons (2008-2025) two days after losing the de facto AFC North championship game to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a missed field goal as time expired.Harbaugh's Ravens went 180-113 in his 18 seasons, good for the fourth-best in the NFL in that span behind only the New England Patriots (193-100), the Pittsburgh Steelers (183-108-2) and the Green Bay Packers (182-108-3). His 13 playoff wins are tied for the seventh-most in NFL history along with Mike Holmgren. Harbaugh's eight road playoff wins are the most in NFL postseason history. He helped lead Baltimore to the second Super Bowl title in franchise history with a victory in Super Bowl XLVII over the San Francisco 49ers to conclude the 2012 season. Harbaugh earned NFL Coach of the Year honors in 2019 when the Ravens produced a 14-2 record in quarterback Lamar Jackson's first of two NFL MVP campaigns. Blowing a 10-0 lead against the Steelers on Sunday night ended up being the final straw for Harbaugh, whose 26 blown leads of 10-plus points are the most by any coach since 2008 when he took over the Ravens' job. Twelve of them occurred over the last five seasons, which is five more than any other team in the NFL. After his 180 wins with the Ravens, the eighth-most by any coach with one team in NFL history, Harbaugh will now be arguably the most coveted coach of this NFL hiring cycle. Here's a look at his top six landing spots now that he is available.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these nine jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns If Harbaugh desired to go the petty route, he could remain in the AFC North with the Cleveland Browns after they fired Kevin Stefanski. Cleveland needs a breath of fresh air after the doom and gloom trading for and extending quarterback Deshaun Watson brought their franchise. Harbaugh oversaw the drafting and development of quarterback Joe Flacco, who won Super Bowl XLVII honors, and Jackson, who won NFL MVP honors in 2019 and 2023. Coaching soon-to-be two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year edge rusher Myles Garrett after he just broke the league's single-season record with 23.0 in 2025 could be very appealing. He'll just need to help Cleveland navigate a successful search for a franchise quarterback after hitting on two with the Ravens in Flacco and Jackson. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons are perhaps the most win-now option of the current NFL coaching vacancies given their young talent and being in the NFC South, a division the Carolina Panthers won with a losing record (8-9) in 2025.\nRunning back Bijan Robinson, at 23 years old, led the NFL in scrimmage yards (2,298). Wide receiver Drake London, 24, has flashed No. 1 wide receiver potential at times. Tight end Kyle Pitts, 25, is showing progress after producing a career-high 88 catches, the second-most in the NFL among tight ends in 2025. Defensively, the Falcons had the 2025 rookie leader in sacks and quarterback pressures (edge rusher James Pearce Jr. with 10.5 sacks and 45 quarterback pressures), the No. 2 2025 rookie leader in sacks (edge rusher Jalon Walker) and the 2025 rookie leader in interceptions (safety Xavier Watts with five). That's a strong foundation for a team whose division is up for grabs every season. If Harbaugh can help the Falcons get the quarterback position right, Atlanta could be a contender for years to come.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants The New York Giants have their hopeful quarterback of the future in place with 2025 first-round pick Jaxson Dart. He ended his rookie year on a high note with 230 yards passing and two passing touchdowns while completing 22 of his 32 throws for a career-high 110.2 passer rating in a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Pro Bowl wide receiver Malik Nabers will be back for Year 3 fully recovered from a torn ACL. \nPro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL in sacks with 16.5, and the Giants also have Pro Bowl defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence in the middle with 2025 third overall pick edge rusher Abdul Carter developing on the other side of the defensive line as well. If Harbaugh wants to coach what is arguably the most talented defensive line in football with some offensive playmakers already in place, the Giants make plenty of sense. It will be interesting to see if he would want to work with general manager Joe Schoen or if he would prefer entering a new team with a general manager he already possesses an established rapport with. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the NFL's iconic franchises, and they provide a long leash for their coaches: they've only had three head coaches since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, the fewest in the league in that span. Harbaugh's former employer, the Baltimore Ravens, also have only had three in that span, but that franchise came into existence in 1996. \nPittsburgh has All-Pro edge rusher T.J. Watt leading their defense, a unit that wasn't the reason they lost in the wild card round against the Houston Texans. However, the defense is getting old fast, and the Steelers haven't been able to find a long-term answer at quarterback since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season. Plus, could Harbaugh really jump from one side of the AFC North's most bitter rivalry to the other? It certainly would feel weird. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders The Raiders are a blank slate Harbaugh can mold in his own image since they have the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick. He can handpick his preferred quarterback between Oregon's Dante Moore and Indiana Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. He would be pairing one of those passers with 2024 sixth overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty. Jeanty is the first rookie in NFL history with 900-plus rushing yards (975), five-plus rushing touchdowns (4) and five-plus receiving touchdowns (5). Plus, 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, who will be in just his third season in 2026. Five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Maxx Crosby is also a fantastic defensive foundation block. However, the AFC West is a gauntlet with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos, the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers and Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsTeam owner Stephen Ross is a huge fan of the Harbaugh family as a prominent University of Michigan alum: the university's business school is named after the Dolphins owner. That could lead to Ross moving heaven and earth to land Harbaugh.Miami will be headed toward a rebuild in 2026 and 2027 with the failed nature of the Tua Tagovailoa era that netted zero playoff wins, which could put the Dolphins in prime position to draft University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning in 2027. That setup, plus the opportunity to live in South Florida as Harbaugh enters his mid-60s, could be quite appealing. \n            ",

Players show up with shiny new toys, transfers and new students enter the fold, and everyone is trying to get a feel of classrooms and what, if any, friends are taking the same courses. And oh yeah, there's that one old guy (Vijay Singh), who is somehow back for another year.Factor in that this school year doesn't start on its usual grounds -- The Sentry at Kapalua -- and the 2026 PGA Tour season is already off to a unique start, albeit one that will feature a stronger-than-usual field at the Sony Open.Without the traditional event on Maui, the Sony Open steps into the box as the leadoff hitter. While the Hawaii swing as a whole may be up in the air for future seasons, this year's tournament at Waialae Country Club welcomes seven of the top 20 players in the Official World Golf Rankings as well as some of the biggest names in the game.U.S. Ryder Cup team members like Russell Henley, Ben Griffin, J.J. Spaun and Collin Morikawa headline the field alongside captain Keegan Bradley. European players such as Robert MacIntyre, Aaron Rai and Harry Hall represent their continent, while an international contingent of Hideki Matusyama, Si Woo Kim, Corey Conners, defending champion Nick Taylor and Adam Scott add to this field.While these players enter the new year with a good sense of their standing, there are plenty who do not and need more than a fast start. This crop of players includes Korn Ferry Tour graduates like Johnny Keefer, who many expect to make a splash, and DP World Tour graduates such as Kristoffer Reitan. PGA Tour sophomores like Matt McCarty, Ryan Gerard and Michael Brennan all have high hopes for the year ahead, as do Maverick McNealy and Chris Gotterup, who had strong seasons.\nOthers like Billy Horschel and Sahith Theegala are returning from injury after experiencing topsy-turvy seasons. Jordan Spieth had a good, albeit not great, 2025 coming off a wrist surgery the prior offseason. They are all looking to put the pedal to the metal just like Tony Finau, Tom Kim and Nick Dunlap, who had seasons to forget in 2025.It's a brand new season. Hope is renewed. Everyone has a chance to cross off those yearly goals when balls start flying on Thursday morning. Waialae CC is a classic golf course, which, despite its lack of length, still presents some challenges to players and intrigue to viewers. The PGA Tour is back. Time to enjoy it.2026 Sony Open scheduleDates: Jan. 15-18Location: Waialae Country Club — Honolulu, HawaiiPar: 70 | Yardage: 7,044 | Architect: Seth RaynorPurse: $9,100,0002026 Sony Open field, oddsOdds via FanDuel Sportsbook\nRussell Henley (11-1): You won't find a bigger Henley fan than yours truly. Driving the Russ bus and proclaiming him a top 10 player in the world a couple of years ago, I was finally vindicated in 2025. Unfortunately, Henley may only have one direction to go from here, and that is in reverse. This backing up will have to wait, however, as the good news is that Waialae CC is an ideal place for him to start his season in style. He has a win in 2013, a playoff loss to Matsuyama in 2022 and finishes of T4 and T10 the last two years. His blend of accuracy and precision is rewarded at this old-school course.Ben Griffin (16-1): Tough to be so pessimistic at the onset of a new year, but that's where we stand. Griffin comes into 2026 fresh off a transformative season in which he won three times, finished inside the top 10 of two major championships and played on the U.S. Ryder Cup team. That may be as good as it gets for the 29-year-old, but that doesn't mean he will slow down immediately. He has never missed a cut in his three trips to Waialae.J.J. Spaun (20-1): For whatever reason, Spaun did not take to Waialae in the early part of his career, but he seemed to have turned the corner last year. The U.S. Open champion finished one stroke outside of a playoff and carried that form into what became a defining season in his career. Similar to Henley, Spaun's driving and wedge play will set him up for success here.Collin Morikawa (20-1): Morikawa makes his first start at the Sony Open since 2021, and it is for good reason. The two-time major champion has not won since Fall 2023 and looks to make inroads early in 2026 with the hopes of his patented iron play showing up in a big way. Iron play was not his issue last year but rather Morikawa's short game, which is an underrated key to success at Waialae. The par-70 course should give us a good idea where Morikawa stands.Keegan Bradley (22-1): The former U.S. Ryder Cup captain is, for my money, the most intriguing player to watch this year. Without the weight of a captaincy and the looming decision of whether he should play, Bradley will be able to play more freely. He has been impressive at Waialae the last four seasons, during which he has finished T12 or better in three of his trips. Bradley's ball striking remains world-class, and his chipping and pitching improved drastically last year.Hideki Matsuyama (22-1)Robert MacIntyre (22-1)Maverick McNealy (25-1)Si Woo Kim (25-1)Harry Hall (25-1)2026 Sony Open picks\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Hideki Matsuyama\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWinner (22-1):  Matsuyama wins far more often than most believe. He has notched two-win campaigns in three of his last four seasons, two of which included wins in the Aloha State. The 33-year-old continues to boast elite iron play and short game and an understanding of the nuances Waialae presents players. He has made nine straight cuts in this tournament, won in 2022 and has five top 20s in his last seven appearances. Oh yeah, he won his last time out at the Hero World Challenge, too.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Matt McCarty\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nContender (60-1):  It's easy to forget since he won so much towards the end of 2024 that McCarty's first full season on the PGA Tour was in 2025. After getting his feet underneath him, he looked much more comfortable the back half of the season with seven top 25s in his last 12 worldwide starts. Another season means another crack at golf courses for a player like McCarty which can only help his cause. The left-hander is one of the best putters in this field and is underrated as a wedge player.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ryan Gerard\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nSleeper (75-1):  Confidence has never been an issue for Gerard, and now, he has a game that is beginning to back it up. The American traveled to Mauritius during the holidays to punch his ticket into the Masters and put a bow on a great 2025 that saw him claim his first PGA Tour title. Gerard noted to CBS Sports that he loves classic, Seth Raynor-designed golf courses which Waialae happens to be. If he finds his groove on the greens, Gerard can dance his way into contention.Who will win the Sony Open in Hawaii, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Visit SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 16 golf majors heading into the weekend, and find out. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. As of Tuesday afternoon, eight NFL teams have fired their coaches and one, Mike Tomlin, has stepped down. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris on Sunday night. And on Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons. Then, last Thursday, the Miami Dolphins fired Mike McDaniel. Tomlin stepped down from his post as the Pittsburgh Steelers head coach after 19 seasons on Tuesday. In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. RavensThe Baltimore Ravens are the only team this coaching cycle that can offer prospective candidates the opportunity to coach a multi-time NFL MVP quarterback in Lamar Jackson. \nPlus, running back Derrick Henry showed no signs of slowing down in his age-31 season in 2025, rushing for 1,585 yards -- the second-most in the entire NFL. There are also a couple All-Pro building blocks on defense with linebacker Roquan Smith and safety Kyle Hamilton. Baltimore should make a playoff return in 2026 no matter who their head coach is provided they reinforce Jackson's offensive line as well as their defensive line. The Ravens do have some cap space to play with at the moment with $12.4 million in effective cap space, according to OverTheCap.com. Moving off of defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike's contract down the road following his neck injury could free up significant cap space in the coming years. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. FalconsThere are a couple of things working against the Falcons here: First and most importantly, there is extreme uncertainty surrounding the quarterback situation. Michael Penix Jr. is coming off yet another knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably not long for Atlanta given that the Falcons can save $22.5 million by cutting him (or $35 million by designating him as a post-June 1 release). The Falcons also do not have a first-round pick in this year's draft after trading up for James Pearce Jr. in 2025 and are set to enter the offseason over the 2026 salary cap. \nAll that said, Atlanta has the most talent of any team with a head-coaching vacancy. Between Bijan Robinson and Drake London on offense, there is already a baseline level of star talent to build around. Kyle Pitts could be back. The offensive line is solid. The defense slowed down after an incredibly hot start to the year but still finished the year 14th in EPA per play allowed. There is at least a foundation for success on that side of the ball, if you can land on the right defensive mind, whether as the head coach or coordinator. The Falcons also play in the NFC South, which is one of the worst divisions in football.The Falcons are running this search in a strange way, though, with separate consulting firms leading the search for the coach and the general manager. Things could get weird if the GM doesn't have the chance to hire their preferred coach. \n\n        \n            \n                Falcons coaching candidates: Why Kevin Stefanski tops list, plus two Rams coordinators should be in play\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. GiantsThe Giants won't have the No. 1 pick in the draft like it seemed they would a few weeks ago, but they do have a few things working in their favor.The first is the young talent on offense, and specifically at quarterback with Jaxson Dart, who showed flashes during his rookie season that he can be a strong option for the Giants under center. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are attractive as well, although they'll both be coming off of major injuries. And Andrew Thomas is an elite tackle. Then there's the defense, which boasts one of the best fronts in the league -- or should, at least. So long as the Giants have Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and Abdul Carter, they should be able to get after it up front. They need to improve on the second and third levels and they definitely need to get better against the run, but there's talent on this side of the ball. \nA potential issue is the ownership and management situation, where John Mara is sadly in poor health and general manager Joe Schoen is set to return (and lead the coaching search) despite not exactly having distinguished himself in the role.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. TitansTennessee restructured its front office over the weekend such that Mike Borgonzi will oversee the 53-man roster and lead the coaching search while Chad Brinker will handle the other football operations responsibilities. The Titans had one of the worst rosters and coaching situations in the NFL this season, but they might be set up to make a jump next year.Cam Ward's overall numbers don't look great, but there were so many flashes of high-level talent when you turn on the film. He was let down by a decrepit supporting cast and has a chance to be much better next year if the Titans improve the talent around him. And they'll have every chance to do so because Tennessee is set to enter the offseason with over $105 million in cap space and the No. 4 pick in the draft. \nThey're not necessarily a candidate to go worst-to-first like the Bears and Patriots did this year, but they definitely have a chance to be a lot better next season if they hit on the right coach and use their budget and draft capital wisely, like those teams did. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.\nOne drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n        \n            \n                Raiders coaching candidates after Pete Carroll firing: Tom Brady ties to Patriots, plus fresh faces\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers have a patient ownership group under the Rooney family: they've only had three head coaches since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. Their defense remains stout led by All-Pro edge rusher T.J. Watt with the Steelers generating three takeaways -- an interception and two fumbles recoveries -- off of Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud in an eventual defeat thanks to their crumbling offense around Aaron Rodgers. This is an organization headed for a rebuild after five consecutive seasons with 9 or 10 wins with four of those years ending with wild card round defeats. \nPittsburgh does have $23.6 million in effective cap space according to OverTheCap.com, but this offseason doesn't have a great free agency quarterback class, notable considering the Steelers haven't had a long-term quarterback since Ben Roethlisberger's retirement after the 2021 season. The best options are Daniel Jones coming off of a torn Achiles, Rodgers entering his age-43 season or Green Bay Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis who shined in relief of Jordan Love the last two seasons. On the trade market, Kyler Murray is likely the best choice. Whoever takes this job will be tasked with helping the Steelers build around that elusive franchise quarterback, rebuild a stale offense and manage what's becoming a quickly aging defense.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.\nThe Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n        \n            \n                Browns fire Kevin Stefanski: Here are five potential coaches who could replace him\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. \nThey do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Miami DolphinsMiami is an interesting spot. Mike McDaniel was able to have his team playing better down the stretch (5-3 after a 2-7 start), but that wasn't enough to save his job, and, in turn, it has them on the outside looking in on the top 10 of the 2026 NFL Draft (picking No. 11 overall). That doesn't give them a clear lane for a top quarterback prospect, as they are likely to move on from Tua Tagovailoa in some capacity this offseason. That could lead to the Dolphins exploring free agency or the trade market to fill their need under center. Because that position is currently clouded at the moment, it may make some coaching candidates wary. The franchise is also looking at a tricky salary cap situation as they are currently projected to be $23.2 million over the cap. Per Over the Cap, even if Miami found a trade partner for Tagovailoa, they'd be looking at a $45.,2 million dead cap charge and about $11.2 million in savings (pre-June 1). That's a long way in saying that it could be a lean first year as the new general manager gets the books in order. As for the talent on the roster, there are some nice pieces on offense in Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, and De'Von Achane, but they are still missing some key building blocks. \n        \n            \n                Dolphins fire Mike McDaniel: Here are five potential coaches who could replace him in Miami\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 65-game bar to be eligible for postseason awards is a tough one to clear. Everyone gets hurt now. There are all sorts of arguments as to why that is, and whether load management even helps, but in the end teams are going to rest guys and on top of that guys are going to get hurt. Miss a couple decently extended stretches, and you're basically out of contention.This is why Nikola Jokić is not going to have a shot at his fourth MVP, and Victor Wembanyama is not going to win his first Defensive player of the Year, for which he would be the runaway favorite had he not already missed 14 games.But we don't have to worry about the 65-game threshold today. Instead, us here at CBS Sports are making our midseason NBA awards picks. We're picking six major awards (MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year, Coach of the Year, 6th Man of the Year and Most Improved Player) based off the basketball we've seen so far as teams hit the 41-game mark this week.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has the inside track on MVP, which would make him just the 16th player NBA history to have won multiple MVPs, and he's still only 27. SGA, however, was not a unanimous selection. In fact, there were no unanimous picks among the awards by our six experts.\nThe other awards are more debatable, and that's what we're here for. As we hit the halfway point of the 2025-26 season, our staff has selected who we believe to be the winner of each award at this point. This is not a prediction for what's going to happen over the second half, but simply who we believe deserves the award if votes were cast today.MVPAward\n                    \n    \n

So why isn't Nikola Jokić the MVP if he's not mathematically eliminated yet? Because he's played six fewer games than SGA and the gap between the two is already razor thin.Most Improved Player is interesting. Deni Advija is going to get a lot of votes because he's been unbelievable, but he was doing this over the final month-plus last season for the Blazers so I see this as more of an extension of that. George, on the other hand, is an entirely different player. He's upped his scoring by almost 50% (from 16.8 PPG to almost 24) and has done so not just by increasing his volume but with efficiency, particularly in the mid-range. George was a sub-starter level last season and this season he's an All-Star player, whether he actually makes the team or not. \nSixth Man of the Year is similarly interesting. Keldon Johnson is not the favorite, and I've watched the Spurs more than any other team this season so perhaps I'm biased -- but this guy has been awesome. Jaime Jaquez Jr. is a worthy pick as is Naz Reid, who carries Minnesota's thin bench, but Johnson's shooting efficiency, rebounding and defense gives him an edge, and I'm also factoring in team success. There are good bench players and there are guys who take over games for critical stretches, and Johnson is the latter. Gonzalez: Before hurting his knee, Nikola Jokić was averaging nearly a 30-point triple double with 60.6/43.5/85.3 shooting splits. That's outrageous. He was on track to lead the league in both rebounds and assists per game, something that's never happened in NBA history. Sometimes we make these awards debates more difficult than necessary. Let's simplify it. Forget the MVP. Who's the best player in the world? Framed that way, I think you'd have a lot more people landing on one particular guy.  Victor Wembanyama, meanwhile, is the single best argument against the 65-game threshold for awards. Wemby is averaging 3.7 stocks (steals and blocks combined). No one else is close. He's also first in defensive estimated plus-minus by a considerable margin. But forget the stats. Watch almost any game on any given night and you'll see how his mere presence makes even the most aggressive opponents think twice about getting to the rim. Wemby stands alone in this category.\nSixth Man might've been the toughest award to pick. There are several deserving but imperfect candidates. Jaime Jaquez has had a nice bounce-back season but feels a little underwhelming here. Keldon Johnson has been terrific at times for the Spurs, but when they're fully healthy I'm not sure he's the best reserve on his own team (Julian Champagnie would like a word). Since late November, Anthony Black has filled it up for Orlando -- but he's also started a ton of games while Jalen Suggs has been on the mend. Ajay Mitchell is a star in waiting on a team already loaded with them. This feels like Naz Reid by default, if only because he's a consistent presence off the Wolves almost non-existent bench. Herbert: I had Nikola Jokić as the MVP before his injury, but it was close enough that SGA's six extra games played give him the edge. By that logic, I couldn't possibly give DPOY to Victor Wembanyama, even though he's the league's best defender. While I considered a few alternatives, I landed on Gobert, whose defensive impact has been undeniable.ROY is the best race going, and I went with Kon Knueppel despite Cooper Flagg having more on-ball responsibility. Knueppel's efficiency and decision-making under pressure have been out of this world, and his 3-point percentage above expected (i.e. the difference between his actual accuracy and how an average shooter would be expected to fare on the same attempts) is identical to Stephen Curry's.\nCOY was, despite a long list of worthy candidates, an easy call. The Celtics are more than the sum of their parts in every way, and Mazzulla's coaching staff deserves credit for not only helping the young players grow but continuing to develop the veterans. That they are No. 2 in offense is astounding. Sixth Man may be the most crowded field of the bunch. I went with an unconventional candidate but, in my view, a deserving one. It's not the Bench Scorer of the Year award, and Stewart has been a dominant interior defender in Detroit. And for MIP, I went with the guy who has absolutely ascended as Portland's primary playmaker. Avdija has become a legit star.Kalland: The first three award choices aren't particularly difficult for me. MVP at this point feels like a foregone conclusion provided SGA stays healthy. DPOY is getting closer with Rudy Gobert producing another fantastic year in Minnesota, but barring the bottom falling out for OKC, what Holmgren's doing (putting up similar numbers in terms of field goal percentage differential) for the league's best defense should win him the award. And then as good as Kon Kneuppel has been, Flagg has been just a bit better and is having to carry a Dallas team that was supposed to provide him with a lot more help than he's been getting. The final three awards are much more interesting to debate. For COY, I'm rolling with Mitch Johnson because what he's done in extracting the absolute most out of this Spurs team, even when Wemby has been injured, has been spectacular. He has young guys playing like veterans and veterans buying into whatever role he's asking them to play. He's navigated star absences, managed egos and has this Spurs team looking like a legitimate threat in the West ahead of schedule, which has him just ahead of J.B. Bickerstaff in my book. Sixth man is also going to be hotly contested, but what Naz Reid does in Minnesota night in and night out is critical for a team that doesn't have a ton in the way of depth. And for MIP, I know Deni Avdija started to put up big numbers late last year, but that was in the context of a team with nothing really to play for. This year, the Blazers are in the thick of the Play-In Tournament race and teams are now game-planning for Avdija as the lead star and he's still producing at a ridiculous rate. There are a handful of deserving candidates, but he's gone from good starter to legitimate All-Star, and that's an incredibly hard leap to make and is deserving of recognition. \nMaloney: While Victor Wembanyama is clearly the best defensive player in the league, I can't give him the mid-season DPOY nod when he's only played in 64% of the Spurs' games, and has been on a minutes restriction in many of his appearances. Instead, I'll go with Rudy Gobert, who has once again been a monster for the Timberwolves. Per databallr, which removes low leverage minutes from the equation, the Timberwolves have a 108.2 defensive rating when Gobert is on the floor and a 123.9 defensive rating when he sits. Rookie of the Year goes to Flagg. Up until a few weeks ago I would have given Kon Knueppel the nod, but Flagg has pulled ahead of him. There are a number of worthy choices for Coach of the Year, including JB Bickerstaff and Jordan Ott, but I'll take Joe Mazzulla, who has a Celtics team that everyone expected to take a gap year in third place in the Eastern Conference. Sixth Man of the Year likewise has many deserving candidates, including 2024 winner Naz Reid and Spurs spark plug Keldon Johnson. However, I'm going with Jaime Jaquez Jr. due to his all-around contributions for the Heat as a scorer and playmaker. Finally, Keyonte George is my MIP pick. Deni Avdija and Jalen Johnson are the betting favorites, but they were both already good last season. George was on his way to bust status and now is making an All-Star case. \nQuinn: Victor Wembanyama may technically still be eligible to win Defensive Player of the Year, but he's missed 14 of San Antonio's 39 games. That's 36% of its season. He's the best per-minute defender in the world, but when someone has missed more than a third of his team's season, I'm not going to pick him to win an award this significant. If he misses three or fewer games the rest of the way and is eligible at the end of the year? I'm happy to revisit his candidacy. For now, I'm going with Rudy Gobert who, aside from a one-game suspension stemming from his sixth flagrant foul point, has not missed a game all season. After taking a slight step back last season, Gobert has quietly posted his second best block rate in four seasons in Minnesota. His rebounding remains stellar, he contests the fifth-most shots per game in the NBA, and the Timberwolves fall off of a cliff defensively whenever he sits. He's not better than Wembanyama, but I'd rather have him every night than Wembanyama most of them.The other five awards were relatively straightforward. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has run away with MVP now that Nikola Jokić is injured. Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel are in the middle of a fierce Rookie of the Year race, but I'm taking the better all-around player in Flagg. I'm not sure Keldon Johnson has missed a shot all season. Joe Mazzulla has a team we assumed would take a gap year in the thick of the Eastern Conference race. Deni Avdija is posting All-Star scoring numbers while serving as Portland's point guard, keeping the Blazers afloat offensively when injuries easily could have doomed their season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In about a month, spring training camps will open across Arizona and Florida, and the first exhibition games are five weeks from this Friday. The World Baseball Classic begins two weeks after that. There are still a lot of trades and free-agent signings that must take place between now and then though. Here are Tuesday's hot stove rumors.  Cardinals, D-backs complete Arenado trade\nThe Cardinals and Diamondbacks have completed a trade sending Nolan Arenado to Arizona. The Cardinals included cash in the deal and got back minor-league right-hander Jack Martinez in the trade. Erstwhile top prospect Jordan Lawlar has not forced the D-backs to give him a full-time lineup spot, creating an opening at third base. Arenado had a full no-trade clause and had to approve the deal.Arenado, 34, has two years and $37 million remaining on his contract, and like the Willson Contreras and Sonny Gray trades, St. Louis ate significant money to facilitate the deal. Arizona will pay him only $5 million in 2026 and $6 million in 2027. The D-backs get a heavily subsidized Arenado to play third base, and the retooling Cardinals cleared money and a lineup spot.Mets offering Tucker $50M per year\nThe Mets have offered outfielder Kyle Tucker a short-term deal worth $50 million per season, reports FanSided. It is believed to be a three-year offer, per The Athletic. Tucker's decision could come as soon as this week. The three-year offer presumably includes opt outs, in which case it will have been modeled after Alex Bregman's three-year, $120 million contract with the Red Sox last year.\nNow 28, Tucker is the best available free agent this winter. The Mets swapped Brandon Nimmo for Marcus Semien earlier this offseason and now have two open outfield spots alongside Juan Soto. Tucker would improve a lineup that lost Nimmo and Pete Alonso (but gained Jorge Polanco) and also help the Mets improve their defense, which is a stated goal this offseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Giants after second base help The Giants are aggressively pursuing second basemen and have discussed Brendan Donovan with the Cardinals and Nico Hoerner with the Cubs, reports ESPN. The Cubbies have more infielders than infield spots after signing Alex Bregman. Trading Hoerner would clear money and allow them to slide Matt Shaw, a Gold Glove finalist at third base as a rookie last year, over to second.San Francisco currently has Casey Schmitt lined up at second base. He's shown power in the past, though he has swing-and-miss and plate discipline concerns, and is just an OK glove man. Slotting Donovan or Hoerner (or someone like that) in at second and moving Schmitt into a utility role would improve the Giants' offensively and defensively, and help with their depth.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rangers focused on pitching Rangers GM Chris Young told reporters, including the Dallas Morning News, that \"pitching is a main focus\" right now, and they \"feel pretty good\" about their offense. Texas swapped Marcus Semien for Brandon Nimmo, and signed catcher Danny Jansen, otherwise they haven't done much to improve an offense that ranked 22nd in runs and 18th in home runs in 2025.The Rangers have a strong rotation top three in Jacob deGrom, Nathan Eovaldi, and Jack Leiter. Jacob Latz and Kumar Rocker are the leading candidates for the Nos. 4 and 5 spots as Cody Bradford rehabs from elbow surgery. A back-end innings guy, essentially what Patrick Corbin was in 2025, feels imperative. The Rangers could also use bullpen help.Little interest in Walker \nThere is minimal trade interest in Astros first baseman Christian Walker, according to The Athletic. Walker has two years and $40 million remaining on his contract and is coming off his worst offensive season since becoming a regular in 2019. The Astros have Carlos Correa locked in at third base and trading Walker would allow them to shift Isaac Paredes to first.\nWalker, 34, has a six-team no-trade clause. His name popped up in talks with the Twins about Correa at last summer's deadline, though Minnesota instead agreed to pay $33 million of the $103 million remaining on Correa's rather than take on Walker as a salary offset. Walker's former team, the Diamondbacks, needs help at first base, though likely not at $20 million a year.  Bichette's meeting with Phillies goes well  \nThe Phillies and free-agent infielder Bo Bichette met earlier this week and the meeting is said to have gone very well, reports the New York Post. New Phillies bench coach Don Mattingly was with Bichette in Toronto the last three years, and, like the Blue Jays, the Phillies offer Bichette a chance to stay near his Florida home in spring training.  Trea Turner is entrenched at shortstop, meaning Bichette would have to play second or third base for the Phillies. That would put Alec Bohm, who is a year away from free agency, more firmly on the trade block. It could also force the club to pivot away from J.T. Realmuto and go with a cheaper option behind the plate. We ranked Bichette as the offseason's third-best free agent.  \n  \tYankees open to including opt outs for Bellinger  \nAs the Yankees and free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger continue their staredown, the team has shown a willingness to include opt-outs in their contract offer, according to The Athletic. New York is said to be offering five years and roughly $160 million. Bellinger and Scott Boras are reportedly looking for seven years. We ranked Bellinger as the offseason's sixth-best free agent.  Now 30, Bellinger is coming off a three-year contract that included opt outs after each season. He declined to opt out after 2024 but did so after 2025. Opt outs have real value, though after his last trip through free agency, Bellinger is likely seeking the biggest payday possible, with or without opt outs. He may never be better positioned to cash in long-term than he is this winter.    \tCardinals still prefer to trade Donovan  \nWith spring training a month away, the Cardinals' preference is still to trade second baseman Brendan Donovan, reports the Belleville News-Democrat. Doing so would net to the team more young talent, particularly on the mound, and also open a lineup spot for top prospect JJ Wetherholt. St. Louis has already dealt away Willson Contreras and Sonny Gray this offseason.  \nDonovan, 28, has two years of team control remaining, and his versatility makes him a fit for just about any contender. Second base and left field are his primary positions, though he has played every position in the big leagues except catcher and center field. The Giants, Mariners, Mets, Reds, Red Sox, and Royals all make sense for Donovan, among other teams.     \tTwins have interest in Domínguez   \nSeranthony Domínguez, perhaps the best available free-agent reliever, received interest from the Twins earlier this offseason, according to KSTP. Minnesota's relief crew is single-ply thin at the moment. Righties Cole Sands and Justin Topa are the club's most trusted late-inning options. Domínguez, 31, split last season between the Orioles and Blue Jays. He has closed and set up in the past. We did not rank Domínguez among the offseason's top 50 free agents.     Collins attempting a comeback   \nLefty Tim Collins, who last pitched in the majors with the Cubs in 2019, is attempting a comeback, reports The Athletic. He spent the last two years coaching in the Phillies' system. Collins will throw for scouts Wednesday in Florida. Now 36, Collins had a 3.60 ERA in 242 ⅓ innings with three teams from 2011-19, and he was as effective against righties as lefties. He was part of the Royals' American League pennant team in 2014, though he missed their 2025 World Series run after Tommy John surgery.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The UFC embarks on a new journey in 2026 with intriguing new directions to unfold. UFC released its first-quarter schedule for 2026. The first stop is UFC 324, the mixed martial arts promotion's debut on Paramount+, featuring two title fights. Beyond that, MMA fans have questions. The White House card is a significant point of intrigue for the wider public, while regular viewers ponder the uncertain futures of Ilia Topuria and Tom Aspinall.Let's dive right in now to the questions and predictions from Brian Campbell, Brent Brookhouse and Shakiel Mahjouri.1. What does the White House main card look like? How many titles are on the line?Despite predictions and rumors provided by everyone from President Donald Trump to UFC announcer Jon Anik regarding the possibility of upwards of nine title bouts, the historic June event on the south lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C. would still suffice with Dana White's prediction of \"the biggest event in UFC history\" by featuring five title bouts. And whether those fights are traditional division titles at stake or the more ceremonial kind like the \"BMF\" belt, all five don't necessarily need to populate the main card in order for the event to be a monumental success. Just having the fight card alone at such a historic and non-traditional venue should be enough to attract a record audience for UFC, likely consisting predominantly of casual fans. And even though it would be important given such a valuable close up for UFC to promote its most talented and accomplished stars of today in title fights, it's just as likely (and important) to cater to the crossover and even lapsed fan with some legend fights (think Conor McGregor-Nate Diaz III). However the UFC ends up booking it, the card needs to be something that appeals to all audiences without destroying the matchmaking capabilities of the numbered events around it. And while the need for American fighters in the main event is not necessary in this case, especially given how much MMA has become a global sport, putting the best fight possible among active competitors as the main event is, which is why I'm still pushing for Islam Makhachev vs. Ilia Topuria. -- Brian Campbell\nI feel like it's a matchmaker's nightmare to try to load a card with five to nine championship bouts. Yes, it makes for a dream card in the moment, but that kind of booking removes potential main events from cards for months before and after that single event. With that in mind, I'm going to say the card features three title fights, along with maybe a BMF title bout and, at most, one interim title on the line. That would still make for a huge card but wouldn't be something that makes it hard to continue business as usual in the time surrounding the (still hypothetical) White House card. -- Brent BrookhouseIf UFC 300 was an indicator, the White House card will be greater than the sum of its parts. To Brent's point, loading up the card with dream fights burdens the rest of the UFC's event calendar. So, as much as I love Brian's idea, I doubt the UFC ties up two of their biggest stars, Makhachev and Topuria, with one fight. I agree with my colleagues on the card's overall direction. The UFC will book multiple title fights: undisputed, interim, and/or BMF. I predict we'll see Makhachev defend the title. We'll also get one major return, most likely Conor McGregor fighting Michael Chandler. Every fight on the main card will be pay-per-view main event-worthy by today's standards, but won't meet fans or the promotion's impossible expectations, at least not until the fights are over. -- Shakiel Mahjouri2. Will Tom Aspinall ever fight again?Unanimous: Yes, with a caveat Yes, and it will happen this year. And even though there is legitimate concern given Aspinall's need for surgery on both eyes following inadvertent pokes from Cyril Gane in their heavyweight title bout last October that he will never be the same, that isn't the only scenario available. Given he heals properly and can pass a medical test, the double eye poke incident could prove to be the turning point in Aspinall adopting the kind of nasty edge to his game that takes him to an entirely new level. Aspinall, who turns 33 in April, is actually still developing as a fighter and remains young given how often heavyweights tend to age differently and hit their fighting peak as they get closer to 40. And nothing about Aspinall's rise toward becoming champion has been normal or traditional; not just his spree of early first-round finishes but the soap opera involving Jon Jones that stunted Aspinall's growth and kept him from true stardom as he was forced to sit and wait for an opportunity that never came. Now, Aspinall is being called a quitter by fans, some media and even his fellow fighters for not fighting through the eye injuries against Gane, which could play a role in only sharpening his resolve to round out his game and come back with a vengeance. -- Campbell\nWe have not seen the end of Aspinall's career, but it seems realistic that he will not fight in 2026. Aspinall may need multiple eye surgeries after suffering brutal eye pokes at the hands (fingers) of Ciryl Gane. Aspinall turns 33 in April, still relatively young for a heavyweight, and there's no reason to rush back before he's ready. Remember, it's not just the time it would take to have surgery and recover, but also the time to get cleared to train and then go through a full training camp ahead of a fight. I certainly hope Aspinall is back sooner than later, it would be great to see how he adjusts to the lessons learned in a rough first round against Gane. I'm just not counting on a quick return for the champ. -- BrookhouseI fear we'll lump Aspinall in the same category as Cain Velasquez, a heavyweight champion with the potential to be an all-time great, but hampered by injuries. What makes Aspinall's situation especially tragic is that his injuries were caused by someone else. Aspinall will undergo multiple eye surgeries this year. I suspect he'll fight again, but not in 2026. He's young enough to seize the throne again as a 32-year-old heavyweight. Hopefully, he won't be as vulnerable to repeat injuries as Velasquez and Dominick Cruz were with their knee issues. Without significant heavyweight turnover, the division will be ripe for Aspinall's picking. Otherwise, his setbacks might stop a legendary run before it starts. -- Mahjouri3. Does Ilia Topuria defend his title this year? If so, against who?No. Topuria stepped away from his lightweight title reign in order to attend to personal issues related to his divorce and the fallout of an ensuing legal battle. And when you add that to the reality of the schedule and the fact that the UFC White House event is looming in June, it's entirely possible that Topuria could find himself moving up to welterweight to challenge rival Islam Makhachev in the main event. Given that Topuria appears to be headed toward a child custody battle outside the Octagon, it's difficult to predict how much that will affect his focus on fighting. The UFC has already made adjustments to that with the announcement of the Paddy Pimblett-Justin Gaethje interim title bout that will headline UFC 324 in Las Vegas on Jan. 24. -- Campbell (also Brookhouse)\nYes. Brian and Brent are right: statistically, Topuria is unlikely to defend his title this year. But I think he does. There are numerous reasons Arman Tsarukyan was left off UFC 324, but one of them is Paddy Pimblett. The UFC has an explosive showdown on its hands if Pimblett becomes the interim lightweight champion. They hate each other. Piggybacking off an earlier sentiment, UFC has too many events to burn Topuria and Makhachev at once. It'd also be wise for Topuria to shake off the rust before moving up to welterweight. Pimblett and Gaethje are both marketable fights for Topuria. So is Oliveira or Holloway, if they become interim champion during Topuria's layoff. There are too many solid options to tempt Topuria away to welterweight right now. -- Mahjouri4. Will Alex Pereira actually move to heavyweight? If so, who does he face first?Outside of a title defense against Carlos Ulberg, who would likely be chosen to compete in a vacant title fight should Pereira move up, there really isn't anything left for \"Poatan\" to do at 205 pounds. Because of that, and the looming White House event, one can reasonably expect the 38-year-old Pereira to move up to heavyweight and compete there for the remainder of his career. While Pereira has been vocal in hoping to face former champion Jon Jones in a superfight at the White House, there is plenty of reason to believe UFC won't reward Jones with such a fight, especially considering he vacated the heavyweight title to avoid Tom Aspinall. And with Aspinall's eye injuries likely keeping him out of action for the first half of 2026, the fight to make for June could be an interim heavyweight title fight matching Gane with Pereira. -- CampbellI like the idea of Pereira fighting Gane for an interim title. That is also a very good fight for Pereira as Gane's wrestling wouldn't be a factor and you almost always have to favor Pereira in a striker vs. striker battle. That said, I think there's some fun to be had with giving Pereira an introductory fight at heavyweight before worrying about title fights. Why not set up Pereira to fight Derrick Lewis in a battle of two of the biggest fan favorites on the roster? That is a fight that promises brutal action and nearly guarantees a knockout. I'm certainly ready for Pereira's heavyweight era to begin. -- Brookhouse\nJones has finally come to his senses that UFC won't book him on the White House card. Pereira loses the heavyweight fight he wants, but I predict he'll make the move regardless. There's a vacuum at heavyweight with Aspinall injured. The UFC needs an interim champion. You can book an interim title fight between Gane and Pereira, but I don't think Gane should be rewarded after double eye poking the champ. Lewis is a suitable candidate, but he's booked to fight Waldo Cortes-Acosta, currently ranked No. 5. Pereira will fight for the interim heavyweight title next. His opponent will be either Gane or the winner of Cortes-Acosta vs. Lewis. -- Mahjouri\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers who are teeing it up this week.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Morikawa joins Si Woo Kim and Robert MacIntyre at +2000, with Keegan Bradley close behind at +2200. Spieth is +4500, just a bit behind defending champion Nick Taylor, who is +4000. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Henley, the betting favorite, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: J.J. Spaun, a +1800 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 2025 U.S. Open winner finished T3 in this event last year. He also brings some momentum into the new year after playing three times in the fall and finishing no worse than T11 in those tournaments. The model has identified him as a top-three contender this week, making him a golfer to back in your Sony Open best bets. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model also has identified three golfers with odds of +2500 or higher as top-10 contenders.

    "body": "\n        Kauffman Stadium, long one of baseball's most cavernous and home run unfriendly ballparks, is getting a facelift. The Kansas City Royals announced Tuesday they are bringing the walls in about 10 feet this coming season. The team aims to make Kauffman Stadium more neutral offensively rather than so unkind to power hitters.\"Our  goal here isn't to have an offensive ballpark,\" GM J.J. Picollo said in a statement. \"It's to  have a very fair ballpark. We don't want it to turn into a bandbox and  every ball up in the air turns into a home run. We just want hitters to  be rewarded when they hit the ball well, particularly in the gaps.\"Here are details on the new dimensions:The wall will come in 8 to 10 feet starting near each foul pole -- the gaps will go from 387 feet to 379 -- and taper back toward centerfield, which will remain 410 feet. The height of the wall will also change, from 10 feet tall in most places to 8 ½ feet. About 150 seats will be added in left field and about 80 new drinkrail seats in right.Kauffman Stadium has played as roughly a league average ballpark the last few seasons, though it has skewed heavily in favor of doubles and triples. Statcast's park factors rate it as a top-five park for doubles and triples, and a bottom-five park for homers. In 2025, the Royals hit 70 home runs at home (27th in MLB) compared to 89 on the road (18th in MLB).The primary beneficiaries will be Kansas City's young power bats, specifically Jac Caglianone and Vinnie Pasquantino. Pasquantino, a lefty with significant pull power, hit 14 home runs at home and 18 on the road last year. Stalwart catcher Salvador Perez has hit 171 of his 303 career home runs away from Kauffman Stadium (56%).\nThe Royals have tinkered with the Kauffman Stadium walls several times in the past. They moved the walls in 10 feet in 1995 before moving them back to their original dimensions in 2004. The team's front office researched the changes and recommended bringing the walls in 10 feet again to make the stadium a little more neutral.\"There's a lot of different things that go into it,\" Picollo said. \"During the course of the season, we just started doing some research, running some numbers and trying to figure out how much this really impacts our offense. Consequently, how would it affect our pitching staff? Ultimately, we concluded that we would be a better team offensively. With our current pitching staff, the changes in the dimensions wouldn't impact (the pitching) negatively as much as it impacts our offense positively.\"Kauffman Stadium opened in 1973. The Royals are seeking a new stadium and have pushed for a $2 billion facility near downtown Kansas City. The NFL's Kansas City Chiefs currently play at Arrowhead Stadium in the same complex as Kauffman Stadium. The Chiefs are moving across state lines to Kansas in 2031.\nThe Royals went 82-80 and missed the postseason in 2025. They won a wild card spot in 2024 and have the talent, both on the mound and at the plate, to make a run at a postseason berth this coming season, if not at the AL Central title.\n            ",

The Chargers fired Roman less than 48 hours after suffering a 16-3 loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC wild card round. In addition to Roman, the Chargers also fired offensive line coach Mike Devlin. Roman, 53, served on Jim Harbaugh's initial staff beginning for the 2024 season. The Chargers' offense was 11th in the NFL in scoring that season, but were just 20th in that area this past season. Los Angeles scored just six total points on its last two games of the season. \nInjuries undoubtedly played a role in the Chargers' offensive struggles. The unit suffered injuries to both starting running backs and both starting tackles as the Chargers made a whopping 32 offensive line changes. Whomever the Chargers hire next becomes be the team's fifth offensive coordinator since drafting Justin Herbert in 2020. While Herbert's regular season numbers are prolific, he has yet to win a playoff game in the NFL. He is 0-3 in the postseason with two touchdowns and four interceptions in those games. \nThe Chargers will quickly begin the process of finding Roman's replacement. Among the possible candidates are former Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, who is interviewing for head coaching positions. McDaniel helped the 49ers reach a Super Bowl as their offensive coordinator, was reportedly contacted by the Lions' regarding their play-calling vacancy. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The St. Louis Cardinals continued their offseason retooling on Tuesday, agreeing to a trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks that sends third baseman Nolan Arenado back to the National League West. In exchange for Arenado and more than $30 million in cash considerations, the Cardinals received right-handed pitching prospect Jack Martinez, an eighth-round pick in last summer's draft.As is always the case here at CBS Sports, whenever a notable trade happens I pop up to provide my thoughts on every player involved in the deal. You'll find those below, along with a letter grade that summarizes my general feelings on how each team fared. Please note that the grade itself is the least important part of the exercise and should be treated as such.\n        \n            \n                Nolan Arenado trade: Diamondbacks acquire former All-Star from Cardinals after lengthy saga\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBefore getting to the analysis, here's the trade again in its entirety: Diamondbacks receive: 3B Nolan Arenado, $31 million in cash considerationsCardinals receive: RHP Jack MartinezLet's get to it.Diamondbacks grade: ASure, why not?Arenado, 34, is one of the most accomplished position players in the league. He's an eight-time All-Star with 10 Gold Gloves and five Silver Sluggers to his credit. There's a real chance that someday you'll be able to visit Cooperstown and see his plaque. And while most of his story has been written and he's no longer an impact-level talent, there's just enough remaining to think this is a fine deal for Arizona.The hot corner is a time machine for Arenado, who remains a skilled third baseman. He's recorded at least five Defensive Runs Saved in 12 of his 13 big-league seasons and there's no reason to doubt him improving on that mark in 2026. For reference, Arizona's collection of third basemen checked in at minus-seven DRS last year, suggesting the Diamondbacks pitching staff should benefit from installing Arenado at the hot corner.\nWhere Father Time has collected rent from Arenado is at the plate. He continued his multi-year offensive descent last season, batting .237/.289/.377 with 12 home runs in 107 games. His 87 OPS+ represented the second-worst mark of his full-season career and his lowest figure since his rookie season in 2013. He continues to possess a good feel for contact, running a zone-contact rate north of 90% for a second year in a row, but he doesn't hit the ball hard and he's prone to expanding the plate.Arenado also employs one of the longest swings in the majors, but he lacks the kinetic propulsion needed to hit for power. If there is a pathway for him to enjoy a rebound season at the plate, it's to be found in the ballpark fit. Arenado is prone to pulling the ball in the air, something that ought to play better in his new ballpark. To wit, Arizona's Chase Field has tied for the fifth-best offensive environment for right-handed batters over the last three seasons; St. Louis' Busch Stadium ranks 20th.That doesn't guarantee anything, but it does provide Arenado with the opportunity to do his best impersonation of Isaac Paredes if he wants to find himself on the sunny side of the league-average offensive line again. \nEven if Arenado just repeats last season this year and next, the Diamondbacks should walk away without much regret. They're paying him low-leverage reliever money to serve as a placeholder until Jordan Lawlar (or another option) knocks him off the roster. Cardinals grade: AThe most impressive part of Chaim Bloom's first winter in charge of the Cardinals has been his ability to engender buy-in from ownership. This represents the third time he's traded away a veteran player while including enough money to ensure a better return than he would've received otherwise. In fact, add the sum attached to Arenado with the nearly $30 million shipped out in the Sonny Gray and Willson Contreras deals and the Cardinals are within earshot of paying other teams' players as much as the Miami Marlins ($73 million) will pay their entire 26-player roster in 2026. History suggests that a lot of owners would rather either keep the players if they have to pay them anyway, or trade those players away for minimal returns in what amounts to a salary dump. The Cardinals have been able to net interesting pitchers in return, several of whom could pay immediate or near-immediate dividends as they continue their retooling process. That's some nifty operating by Bloom and company to make it happen.\nMartinez, 22, was picked in the eighth round last summer after splitting his collegiate days between Trinity, Louisiana-Lafayette, and Arizona State. In 15 starts, he compiled a 5.47 ERA and a 3.33 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He's a well-built right-hander with good arm strength and some feel for secondary pitches. His delivery is messy, however, as he combines a long arm stroke with a tendency to land wide open, sometimes with his lead foot pointing toward first base. Predictably, that delivery has hampered his strikethrowing ability, resulting in him walking five batters per nine as an amateur.   Martinez spent most of his collegiate career in the bullpen and it's probable that he returns there as a professional. The Cardinals can afford to give their player development staff some time and space to see what magic they can or cannot work with him. Truthfully, St. Louis did well to walk away with a player who has a non-zero chance at achieving a big-league future down the road. Otherwise? Shedding Arenado creates more opportunity for internal options. The Cardinals will be better suited giving those at-bats to Nolan Gorman, Thomas Saggese, or even former first-round pick JJ Wetherholt, one of the top candidates to win the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 2026. \n            ",

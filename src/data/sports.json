    "body": "\n        Alysa Liu never thought she'd figure skate again. When many 16 year olds are getting their driver's license and going through the many highs and lows of high school, Liu announced she was retiring from the sport that dominated most of her life.\"I was like, 'Yeah, I'm calling it quits now,'\" Liu told 60 Minutes in an interview before the Olympics began. Liu announced her retirement in 2022 following a sixth-place finish at the Beijing Games and capturing a bronze medal at the World Championships that year. The northern California native took to Instagram on April 9 to make the announcement, saying, \"I honestly never thought I would accomplish as much as I did, I'm so happy. I feel so satisfied with how my skating career has gone. Now that I'm finally done with my goals in skating, I'm going to be moving on with my life.\"Liu has been skating since the age of 5, and began competing in major competitions at only 10 years old. She racked up as many accolades over a six-year span as some professional athletes whose careers last twice as long. She's a two-time U.S. Championships figure skating gold medalist, a two-time U.S. Championships silver medalist, and at 13 became the youngest U.S. women's national champion ever. When she was 14, Liu became the youngest skater ever to win two senior national titles. In 2019, she became the first U.S. female figure skater to land a quadruple jump in an international competition.Then, seemingly at the height of her career, Liu called it quits.She traded rink time for quality time. The hours spent training on her craft were replaced with hours spent trained on family and friends. It was an abrupt retirement to those within the figure skating community. But Liu's decision to retire was something she already got a taste of before, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down everything across the globe, including sports.\n\"I was like, 'Wow, this is what a break feels like,'\" Liu said. \"And then I was like, 'I really like not skating.'\"Liu's rink in Oakland -- along with everything else at the height of the pandemic -- closed in 2020, allowing her genuine free time. For someone who had been skating every day that could feel a bit abnormal, but Liu wasn't desperate to get back on the rink.\"Honestly, I was hoping, like the rinks wouldn't open,\" Liu said. But eventually they did in 2022, and she made the Olympic team and earned a bronze medal at the World Championships. However, Liu's love for the sport was waning, and as she was thinking about her future, one without figure skating was becoming more of a possibility.\n\"It was a crucial time in my life,\" Liu said of the decision to retire. \"I was 16 and college was coming up. Like, I wanted to do so much. I went to Nepal and I trekked to Everest Base Camp. Me and my friends would do tons of road trips. I was really just livin' it up. I would say it was my best life.\"The 'quick hits of dopamine'There was no point during her hiatus that she missed skating, and Liu did pretty well to insulate herself from even thinking about the sport. She deleted her Instagram account at the time, which for any teenager -- even an Olympic athlete -- could be a life-altering choice. Without seeing any constant news of the sport, Liu didn't have a difficult time moving on from it. It wasn't a topic of conversation around her, so it was truly, out of sight, out of mind.But as she put more distance between herself and skating, Liu started to get that itch to lace up her skates again. She had no plans of returning to competition, but rather enjoyed just being out on the ice and getting those \"quick hits of dopamine\" as she calls them. But just like when Michael Jordan and Tom Brady came out of retirement, Liu couldn't deny the intense feeling of wanting to still compete.\nShe officially announced her return to the sport in March 2024 on Instagram. Liu's announcement came in the form of a hype video that showed snippets of her progression in landing a triple jump from the time she returned to the ice in January 2024 to two months later.\n\nIt was akin to Jordan's, \"I'm back,\" moment, but when she returned to skating this time, Liu wanted things to be different.\"I get to pick my own program music,\" Liu said. \"I get to help with the creative process of the program. If I feel like I'm skating too much, I'll back down. If I feel like I'm not skating enough I'll ramp it up. No one's gonna starve me or tell me what I can and can't eat.\"\nHer coaches agreed to Liu's terms, and through a more collaborative process, they've seen her be a better skater. \"For many years she was dropped off at the rink,\" said Liu's coach Phillip DiGuglielmo. \"She was told what to do. Now she comes in, and it is all collaborative.\"It wasn't an easy return, there was lots of falling and conditioning to get back to where she was, but Liu found joy in the journey. \"I love struggling actually,\" Liu said. \"It makes me feel alive.\"Lady Gaga and striped bleached hairThe struggle didn't last for long, though, as Liu did the unthinkable just a year after returning to the sport. At the 2025 World Championships, she became the first U.S. woman to win a world title since Kimmie Meissner in 2006. Winning gold at the World Championships was not on Liu's bingo card, but her comeback has been full of surprises.\nSince Liu's returned, you can see more creative expression from her. She's choosing more edgy music than you'd expect from a typical ice skating program, like a medley of Lady Gaga songs that her free skate program was set to, which won silver at the U.S. figure skating championships on Jan. 11. During that competition, Liu broke the record for the highest U.S. national women's short program score of 81.11. It would've likely meant gold for Liu, but teammate Amber Glenn delivered a short program score of 83.05, which helped her claim the title.It's not just her music where you'll see self expression from Liu. Her signature look are the bleached stripes in her hair. \"I do this every year,\" Liu said. \"I add a stripe, so it's going to be like this for a year. Then next year wintertime, like end of December, I do another ring,\"\nIt's all part of a more authentic version of Liu, one who still likes the challenge the sport brings, but has made her own tweaks to not feel so boxed in. Liu does not appear to be defined by winning as she hopes to just entertain the crowd and \"hype people up\" with her performance.\nStill, she is considered a contender to take home top prize Thursday at the conclusion of the two-day competition, which begins with the short program at 12:45 p.m. Tuesday. And if she does win gold, Liu will become the first American woman to win an Olympic figure skating singles title in 24 years. No matter what, she won't be coming home empty-handed after the United States got to the top of the podium in the team event last week.Though it's atypical for a figure skater to return to peak levels after taking two years off, especially returning at 20 years old, Liu has proven she doesn't fit that mold. Ever since she was breaking records as a pre-teen, Liu has made defying the odds -- and convention -- routine for her. So why would a gold medal for her individual effort be out of the question?\n            ",

Glenn and Liu were both part of the United States' team event gold, and now they, along with Isabeau Levito, look to become the first U.S. women to medal in the singles figure skating since 2006.

    "body": "\n        The MAC is adding Sacramento State as a football-only member starting in 2026, the conference announced on Monday. The Hornets will join the conference on July 1 for a five-year term. Sac State will serve as a replacement for Northern Illinois in the MAC. The Huskies will officially depart for the Mountain West as a football-only member this summer. \"Today's exciting announcement is about strengthening our competitive profile and creating value for the membership,\" MAC Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said in a release. \"We were presented with an opportunity to add an institution with demonstrated success in football, a record of investment and commitment to the continued growth of the institution and community.  Sacramento State is ready and poised for this next step.  I welcome the Hornets to the Mid-American Conference and expect they will become a competitive and contributing member to the long history and legacy of one of the oldest Division I conferences.\"According to ESPN, Sac State's cost of entry is expected to be around $18 million.Sac State has not released its 2026 football schedule, but multiple programs have announced games against the Hornets including Tarleton State, Maine and North Alabama. Sac State is also scheduled to face Fresno State in Week 2, as outlined in the Pac-12 schedule release. \n\n        \n            \n                Longtime FCS standard bearer North Dakota State seeks fresh challenge with leap to FBS\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSac State moved all non-football sports to from the Big Sky to the Big West last summer and applied for a waiver to join the FBS as an independent. After that waiver was denied by the NCAA, the school competed for one final football season in the Big Sky, finishing 7-5 overall with a 5-3 conference mark.Meanwhile, school president Luke Wood and athletic director Mark Orr went back to the drawing board, with the MAC mebership emerging as the most logical path to the FBS. The Hornets have also been preparing on the NIL front, with a budget \"north of $1 million,\" a source told CBS Sports. The school hired Arizona assistant Alonzo Carter on Dec. 15 after former coach Brennan Marion departed to join Deion Sanders' Colorado staff as offensive coordinator. \nCarter is a first-time head coach who has spent the last eight seasons working under Brent Brennan at both San Jose State and Arizona. He has deep recruiting ties to California after starting his career as a high school coach in the state.\"We are thrilled to welcome Alonzo Carter as our next head football coach,\" Orr said in a statement released by the school. \"Coach Carter is a proven leader who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of success in recruiting, constructing teams, and producing results at all levels of football makes him an ideal fit for Sacramento State. We look forward to welcoming him and his family back to his native Northern California and having him as part of the Sacramento community for years to come.\"The Hornets will be the second FCS school to make the jump in 2026, joining North Dakota State. The Bison moved up from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Mountain West earlier this month. \n            ",

Los Blancos aim to correct course in a season full of ups and downs, anchored by an in-form Kylian Mbappe and Vinciius Junior and boosted by the long-awaited return of Trent Alexander-Arnold during his injury-plagued first season in Madrid.Elsewhere in Europe, reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain resume their title defense with a two-legged tie against fellow Ligue 1 side Monaco.

Inter have looked very, very good lately but anything can happen in knockout football, particularly when the first leg takes place in such trying circumstances.  Pardeep Cattry: Juventus -- Juventus have undoubtedly improved since bringing in Luciano Spalletti as the coach last fall, keeping themselves competitive in a fiercely-contested battle for a top four berth in Serie A. Their imperfections are hard to miss, though -- Weston McKennie's impressive form is a highlight but Juventus are currently a bit porous in defense, which could hamper their chances of making their deepest Champions League run in four years. Galatasaray struggled at times during the league phase, but they tend to hold their own at home and boast two reliable goalscorers in Victor Osimhen and Mauro Icardi. It makes Juventus particularly vulnerable in the knockout phase playoffs, progression no sure thing even if they are the favorites.  Francesco Porzio: Atalanta -- The Italian team is the favourite to make it to the knockout stages against Borussia Dortmund, but will need to be extra careful especially in the first leg that will be played away in Germany. The side coached by Raffaele Palladino is considered one of the best teams of the playoffs and come from three wins in a row against Lazio, Cremonese and Juventus in the Coppa Italia quarterfinals.   Chuck Booth: Juventus -- It may be a stretch calling Juventus favorites, but RAMS Park is one of the toughest places in the world to play. This is a Juve side that has been playing uncharacteristically fun soccer these days, but they're far from consistent, which is where Victor Oshiemen and Galatasaray can make something happen. If Juve leaves this game behind on aggregate, it could be hard to find a way back.\n Underdogs that will get into the round of 16 James Benge: Galatasaray -- Should a team with Victor Osimhen in it be considered underdogs? Perhaps only because Galatasaray have drawn a quite impressive opponent in Juventus. Okan Buruk's side have been flying lately in the domestic game and have already gotten impressive results against Liverpool and Atletico Madrid at home.   Pardeep Cattry: Galatasaray -- Three wins in the league phase does not make for the most impressive record, especially when they came against an out-of-form Liverpool and two inferior opponents in Bodo/Glimt and Ajax, but Galatasaray have always been well-positioned to punch above their weight in a competition like this one. The aforementioned Icardi and Osimhen have 15 goals each across all competitions, the pair alone offering enough might to make things interesting against Juventus, though they have star quality in other areas of the pitch, too. The odds make it improbable -- they have not reached the Champions League round of 16 since the 2013-14 -- but if there's any tie that has upset watch written all over it, it's this one.  Francesco Porzio: Club Brugge -- The Belgian team was probably one of the biggest disappointments of the league phase but at the end managed to qualify for the playoffs. They will face Atletico Madrid and despite being less competitive, the Spanish giants are not living their best season under Diego Simeone and recently lost 3-0 against Rayo Vallecano over the weekend, underlining the issues they are currently facing.   Chuck Booth: Qarabag -- The Azerbaijani side may have cooled off after their hot start to league phase play, but facing a Newcastle United side who are dealing with fixture congestion and one of the longest trips that any team will take during UCL play. That much travel and the pressure of being a Premier League side can lead to upsets, which is something that Eddie Howe will have to watch out for. Team that most needed a bye, yet has to play the playoff James Benge: Newcastle -- If nothing else, can you imagine how embarrassing it is turning up to the next Premier League meeting when you're the only team who didn't get top eight in the league phase? Lads, even Tottenham did that. A 5,000 mile round trip to Baku could scarcely come at a worse time for injury addled Newcastle, who had to dig deep to beat Aston Villa in the FA Cup and will have to keep one eye on Saturday night's game at Manchester City.  Pardeep Cattry: PSG -- The reigning champions have all the tools they need to succeed and boast a favorable tie against Monaco, who have been in middling form in Ligue 1 and the Champions League this season. Paris Saint-Germain, though, enter the knockout phase playoffs in the midst of a rough patch -- they have won just four of their last eight, a run of form that saw them knocked out of the Coupe de France, fail to break into the Champions League's top eight and slip to second in Ligue 1. If anyone can turn things around, it's Luis Enrique's team, but the onus is on them to snap out of their funk in order to do so.  Francesco Porzio: AS Monaco -- The French only won two of the eight games played in the league phase of the Champions League and despite that qualified as the 21th team in the standings. For this reason they will now meet PSG in the playoffs, one of the most difficult matchups they could possibly imagine.   Chuck Booth: Borussia Dortmund -- Faced with one of the toughest matchups in the entire knockout phase, you may not know what you'll get from Atalanta on a day-to-day basis, but they'll give Dortmund all they can handle in these two legs. The German side will expect to make it to the round of 16 due to their success going deep in this competition in previous years, but getting the toughest draw that they could, won't make it easy.\n Playoff team most likely to win it all James Benge: PSG -- The form and particularly fitness that Luis Enrique found at the back end of last season hasn't really returned to PSG for any consistent run of games. When it has, however, this has still proven itself to be a team who can blitz the best that Ligue 1 has to offer, except for some weirdness against Rennes. There is no reason to think that they don't at least belong among the top three favorites to win the Champions League.   Pardeep Cattry: PSG -- Sure, they may not be at their best at this exact moment but the shine of their hisotric treble has not actually worn off PSG. They have been unlucky at times during their recent skid, a signal that they can still hack it amongst Europe's elites as long as they end the streak of inconsistency. The knockout phase playoff tie against Monaco offers a great chance for them to reset but even if they progress in unideal circumsntaces, the teams that await them should discount them at their own risk.  Francesco Porzio: PSG -- The 2024-25 Champions League winners are finally back at their usual level. The French giants are at the top of the Ligue 1 standings and they are gaining their best form after a challenging first part of the season. They are reaching their best form when it counts.Chuck Booth: PSG -- We're unanimous here for a reason. The reigning champions of this competition, there's no reason why PSG can't win it again. When Ousmane Dembele has been on the pitch, this is one of the best teams in the world. They've had to spend more time without him than anyone would prefer, but if PSG are able to get through this round and get healthier as a squad, look out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The All-Star weekend came and went, providing players with a much-needed rest. Heading into the final two months of the regular season, the direction for certain teams appears to be clear. While this could provide fantasy managers with at least some clarity, sit/start decisions are still going to be far from obvious. Much like last week, this week also has only four days of action, with the Jazz suiting up just once. Meanwhile, 13 teams will suit up three times, leaving the remaining 16 teams with two games each. Sitting players who only go one or two times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Three Games: ATL, BKN, CHA, CHI, CLE, DEN, IND, LAC, NYK, ORL, PHI, PHO, WASTwo Games: BOS, DAL, DET, GSW, HOU, LAL, MEM, MIA, MIL, MIN, NOP, OKC, POR, SAC, SAS, TOROne Game: UTAHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the 18th week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Nolan Traore, BKNOpponents: @CLE, @OKC, @ATLDespite some shifts in the Brooklyn rotation, Traore appears to be relatively safe at the moment. Outside of an illness that cost him two games in late January, Traore has been able to carve out a consistent role, having now started in eight straight games. He has scored double digits in four consecutive appearances, handing out 32 assists during that period. At this stage, his fantasy value is largely tied to points and assists, meaning he won't be the best fit for everyone. However, with three games in four nights, the potential for him to flirt with top 100 value is there. Consider starting: Jaden Ivey, CHIOpponents: TOR, DET, NYKWhen it comes to forward thinking in Chicago, the track record is certainly not favorable. Although Nikola Vucevic was finally traded, the Bulls then subsequently acquired multiple guards, one of whom was Ivey. However, since arriving in the windy city, Ivey has seemingly established himself as a part of the short-term future. In four appearances for his new team, he has averaged 11.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, four assists, two steals, and two 3-pointers. The eventual return of both Josh Giddey and Tre Jones is going to complicate matters, that's for sure. However, assuming Ivey can maintain a 28-minute per-night role, he would be able to provide fantasy managers with adequate value moving forward.Consider sitting: Ty Jerome, MEMOpponents: UTA, @MIAAlthough Jerome has been a real bright spot for the Grizzlies since returning from injury, the schedule is simply working against him this week. Not only does Memphis have two games, but they also come on back-to-back nights. Based on what we have seen since Jerome returned, there is a decent chance we will only see him for one of the two games, limiting his opportunities. With 13 teams playing three times, this is really just a case of simple math. One game of Jerome, who could very well end up playing fewer than 25 minutes, is not enough to warrant a starting spot. \nForwardsConsider starting: Jarace Walker, INDOpponents: @WAS, @WAS, DALSeen as a priority stash heading into the trade deadline, Walker's role received a small bump after Johnny Furphy was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a knee injury. Walker has now played at least 30 minutes in three of his past four games, providing fantasy managers with serviceable production on both ends of the floor. In fact, in 14 games over the past month, he has averaged 14.9 points, 4.7 rebounds, 1.1 steals,s and 1.9 3-pointers, shooting 48.4 percent from the field and 73.8 percent from the line. His ceiling is somewhat limited, but given the opportunity that lies ahead of him, he should be rostered in all formats.Consider sitting: Lauri Markkanen, UTAOpponents: @MEMAnother team that appears to be prioritizing losses over wins, Utah's shenanigans were seemingly found out by the NBA after fines were issued last week. However, this is unlikely to have an impact on the ultimate goal, meaning Markkanen is going to continue to miss games. Not only does Utah have one game this week, but it is against another tanking team, the Indiana Pacers. Factoring in everything we know about how these teams approach matchups such as this, we could very well see Markkanen on the sideline, giving him potentially zero games in four nights.Consider sitting: Ace Bailey, UTAOpponents: @MEMIt's basically rinse and repeat when it comes to any Utah player, Bailey included. Although he has been able to turn things around after a disappointing start to his rookie season, one game of Bailey just isn't enough to warrant a starting spot, outside of deeper formats. Unlike Markkanen, Bailey should at least be available to play, given he has suited up in 18 straight games, avoiding all of the roster shuffling. While there should be a spot on most rosters for Bailey moving forward, starting him this week is just too risky.\nCentersConsider starting: Tristan Vukcevic, WASOpponents: IND, IND, CHAAlthough it's been another disappointing season for Vukcevic, things could be about to flip. Alex Sarr has been ruled out for at least the next week with what Washington is calling a hamstring strain. Based on what we know about soft-tissue injuries, that timeline could certainly extend to multiple weeks. Coupled with the fact that Washington is looking to lose as many games as possible, we have a situation where Vukcevic could find himself as the starting center for the foreseeable future. In three games over the past week, he has been a top 120 player in just 17.2 minutes per game, averaging 14 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.7 3-pointers, and 1.4 combined steals and blocks. If his role extends to 28 minutes per game, we could have a top 80 player on our hands. Consider sitting: Santi Aldama, MEMOpponents: UTA, @MIAAlthough the path to minutes for Aldama is relatively clear following the Jaren Jackson trade, ongoing knee issues have limited him to just two games in the past month. That alone should at least make managers question his spot in the rotation. Memphis also has two games this week, both of which come on consecutive nights. Given the fact that Aldama's knee concerns have been lingering, there is almost no way he plays in both games, and that's assuming he returns at all. This is a simple one for managers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A day like today was always coming for the Dolphins. Maybe it was before the season. Maybe it was when they started 0-3, or when wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered a brutal knee injury in Week 4, or when they fired GM Chris Grier and sold at the trade deadline. When they benched Tua Tagovailoa and, a few weeks later, fired coach Mike McDaniel, the writing was officially on the wall.The Dolphins, as we knew them for the past four seasons, were a thing of the past, and their roster teardown began in earnest Monday when they released Hill, edge rusher Bradley Chubb, offensive lineman James Daniels and wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.Hill and Chubb are the headliners. When the Dolphins were at their best, making the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, so, too, was Hill. He had 1,710 receiving yards in 2022 and 1,799 in 2023. He not only became the first player in NFL history with 1,700+ yards in multiple seasons, but he did it in consecutive seasons. Miami's offense hummed along; it led the NFL in yards and was second in points in 2023.Chubb was part of the effort to elevate the defense to, if not a similar level, at least a viable level. The Dolphins sent a first-round pick to the Broncos in 2022 and signed Chubb to a five-year, $110 million extension. The Dolphins made the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, with Chubb racking up 11 sacks and a league-leading six forced fumbles in the latter.\n\n        \n            \n                Tyreek Hill landing spots: Chiefs, Bills and other AFC contenders among top fits after Dolphins release WR\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe excitement came to an end even faster that it had arrived, a tale as old as time in the NFL. The Dolphins' playoff duds revealed serious flaws. Tagovailoa struggled with concussions. Chubb missed the entire 2024 season with a torn ACL. Miami missed the postseason each of the last two seasons.Now, new GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and new coach Jeff Hafley -- both from the Packers -- are turning over a new leaf. Monday's releases clear $56 million in 2026 cap space, per NFL Media. That duo still has much to do, though.The fact that Sullivan comes from Green Bay shouldn't be lost. The Packers once moved on from a veteran quarterback and didn't skip a beat. They built the NFL's youngest roster and loaded it with talent.\nDon't expect a similar path in the immediate future from Miami, which is in a very different spot. Miami can begin to dig itself out of its mess this offseason, but this is very much a multiyear project. Here are the first steps.Figure out Tua Tagovailoa's futureThis is the elephant in the room. Last week, Sullivan said the Dolphins were \"getting close\" on a decision regarding the embattled quarterback, and he has previously said the team would look at all options at quarterback this offseason.The expectation is that the Dolphins move on. It's much easier said than done. As Jordan Dajani wrote earlier this month:\nThe former No. 5 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension prior to the 2024 season after a career year. Trading Tagovailoa would be ideal, but Miami would have to eat a chunk of the $54 million guaranteed salary he has in 2026. Plus, there would be a $45.2 million dead cap hit if Tagovailoa is traded before June 1 as well. It would appear a cut is more likely, but that has ramifications, too.Tagovailoa release with post-June 1 designation (via Spotrac) 2026 dead cap$67,400,0002027 dead cap$31,800,0002026 savings$-11,132,353Parting ways with Tagovailoa would leave 2025 sixth-rounder Cam Miller (originally drafted by the Raiders) and 2025 seventh-rounder Quinn Ewers as the only quarterbacks under contract for the 2026 season.\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: Tua Tagovailoa, A.J.

In 2024, the Broncos released Wilson, incurring a $53 million dead cap hit. That's still the record; Tagovailoa's $67.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 would shatter it.Sullivan and Hafley have a blank canvas here. Ewers looked like a seventh-round rookie playing out the string last year. If they want to give him another year -- or see what they have in Miller -- they could, but it would likely mean they're punting on the season. Since the NFL Draft shrunk to seven rounds in 1994, only one rookie drafted in the seventh round won double-digit games in his second year or earlier: Brock Purdy. If Sullivan and Hafley believe they have the next Purdy (and the next Kyle Shanahan in offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik), more power to them. In all likelihood, neither Ewers nor Miller is the answer.One of the main reasons the Broncos were able to rebound from the Wilson disaster is they had the 12th pick in the quarterback-rich 2024 draft. They selected Bo Nix and, alongside coach Sean Payton and a strong defense, emerged as one of the NFL's top teams in short order.The Dolphins don't have the luxury of a quarterback-rich draft. Fernando Mendoza is the only surefire first-round quarterback; the 2024 class had six quarterbacks in the top 12. Miami could opt for a mid-round quarterback if Sullivan and co. find one they like.Before that, though, the Dolphins will have opportunities in free agency. The most obvious tie is Malik Willis, who played well in relief of Jordan Love in Green Bay. Willis is a wild card in this class. Is he viewed as a bridge quarterback or one worthy of a sizable long-term contract? His play in Green Bay was admirable; it also came in very small doses and under a premier offensive mind in Matt LaFleur. If Sullivan and Hafley want to reunite with Willis, it will have to be at a cost that isn't prohibitive given the incoming financial implications of the Tagovailoa departure.Other options include a veteran who could provide a viable baseline -- think Wilson, Joe Flacco or Marcus Mariota -- or a trade for a low-end starter, like Mac Jones. Sullivan might be reticent to give up draft capital, though, and that would make sense given the situation.The best path forward could be a combination of sorts: a veteran plus a mid-round pick, neither of whom would preclude them from drafting a quarterback in 2027, when the quarterback pool is projected to be much stronger.Improve the trenches and the defensive secondaryIn a significant win for the Dolphins, Aaron Brewer came out of nowhere to be one of the NFL's premier centers in 2025. A second-team All-Pro, Brewer is 28 and has one more year left on his deal. He will be a key holdover for Miami in its new era. Left tackle Patrick Paul, a 2024 second-round pick, showed significant improvement in his second year, too.Around them, though, are major questions. Left guard Jonah Savaiinaea, a second-round pick in 2025, struggled mightily as a rookie. Right guard Cole Strange was marginally better. Right tackle Larry Borom was OK.\n2025 Dolphins OLPFF rankLT Patrick Paul43rd out of 84 OTsLG Jonah Savaiinaea79th out of 79 OGsC Aaron Brewer2nd out of 37 CsRG Cole Strange57th out of 79 OGsRT Larry Borom58th out of 84 OTsAn upgrade or two would help whomever plays quarterback in 2026 as well as De'Von Achane, who figures to be a fulcrum after a breakout 2025.The Dolphins have now moved on from both Chubb and Jaelan Phillips (traded to the Eagles at the deadline), two edge rushers who looked to be a significant part of Miami's future just a few months ago. Again, things change quickly in the NFL. Miami would love to see a bounce-back campaign from 2024 first-round pick Chop Robinson and a major leap from 2025 first-round pick Kenneth Grant. Absent those developments, there's a dearth of young talent on the defensive front -- another imposing challenge moving forward.The Dolphins could also use upgrades in the secondary around Minkah Fitzpatrick, who continues to provide solid play, if not his previous All-Pro level. Cornerback will be a major area of focus after injuries derailed the group in 2025.\nRealize it won't all happen in one yearLet's go back to the 2024 Broncos. As outlined above, this isn't the 2024 class at quarterback. The 2026 Dolphins also won't be the 2024 Broncos when it comes to young talent. Denver had three All-Pro defenders in cornerback Patrick Surtain II (the Defensive Player of the Year), edge rusher Nik Bonitto and defensive lineman Zach Allen. All were in their age-27 season or younger. If the Dolphins have one young defender become an All-Pro in 2026, it'd be a significant success in the short and long terms.One of the worst things an NFL team can do is lie to itself about where it is. Sullivan and Hafley need and deserve a long runway, and they need to use every inch of it. This is a roster in a bad spot in terms of current talent and means to acquire it. That's what happens when a $212 million bet on a quarterback goes bust, and the roster was already in a tenuous spot.Miami has its own first- and second-round picks and three third-round picks. That's five picks in the top 90. Before they even get there, though, they owe it to themselves to find the right free agent crop.\nIt doesn't have to be the \"best\" crop -- and it won't be. But it needs to be the right crop. Veterans who can establish a solid, dependable baseline and foster a culture for the youngsters. Swings on players in or approaching their primes who needed a change of scenery.Rome wasn't built in a day; Miami's new era won't be either. But with a smart, measured approach to free agency, hits in the draft and internal development, the Dolphins can gradually build toward a bright future -- something they haven't had in several years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Eleven of the teams ranked in the latest AP Top 25 poll will be in action Tuesday, as conference title races ramp up with less than a month remaining until Selection Sunday. The headliner of the slate will be a battle of Big Ten foes when No. 1 Michigan faces No. 7 Purdue in West Lafayette, Indiana.Michigan jumped Arizona this week for the top spot in the AP poll for the first time since January 2013. However, the Wolverines' last stint as the No. 1 team in the country was short-lived, as Michigan lost to then-No. 3 Indiana. The Wolverines dropped back to No. 3 the following week.Not only does Michigan face Purdue on Tuesday, but the Wolverines also have a clash with No. 3 Duke on Saturday in one of the best weekends of hoops on the calendar this season.No. 16 North Carolina has a key showdown against in-state rival NC State later in the day. The Tar Heels will be without star freshman Caleb Wilson for that game and the foreseeable future after the projected top-five pick in the 2026 NBA Draft fractured his hand.\nElsewhere in the ACC, No. 21 Louisville will look to stay hot against SMU on the road. No. 22 Miami (Ohio) will also be in action against Massachusetts. The Redhawks are the final undefeated team remaining in Division I basketball.Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET                              No. 1 Michigan at No. 7 Purdue \n6:30 p.m. on Peacock: In almost every other week, this game would earn the distinction of the best game of the week in college basketball. That's not the case here, as this isn't even Michigan's most anticipated game of the schedule this week. Still, this game has huge implications for the Big Ten regular-season title race. The Wolverines have an opportunity to create more separation at the top and make it increasingly difficult for any other team to catch them. Michigan is the best team in college basketball. Even in a hostile environment like Mackey Arena, the Wolverines don't get caught looking ahead to Saturday and win this game.

Last weekend against Pitt, UNC had to play without Wilson and star big man Henri Veesaar, but was able to come away with a 14-point win. It remains unclear if Veesaar will play on Tuesday and that will be a major storyline to monitor. If he can't go, look for Jarin Stevenson to step up. He had 19 points against Pitt last weekend. Even if Veesaar doesn't play, UNC pulls off the upset against its in-state foe.

Since Brown returned to the lineup last month, the Cardinals are 6-1, with the lone loss coming against Duke. Brown already went up against SMU last month in his third game back, finishing with 20 points. I'm expecting Brown to have another big night on offense. He has shot 14 of 21 from the 3-point line in his last two games, including going a perfect 16 of 16 from the free-throw line. Louisville wins on the road. Pick: Louisville -3.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            LVILLE -3.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            SMU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            SMU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            SMU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            SMU\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n           Georgia at Kentucky          \n9 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Even as we head into March, Kentucky remains one of the toughest teams to figure out and project long-term. The highs are high, and the lows are … well, low. As cliché as it sounds, Kentucky's ceiling is high, but its floor is all over the place. Still, Kentucky should be able to take business at home against Georgia.

    "body": "\n        Europe's best and brightest lay in wait, but for now, the Champions League is off on a little sojourn as the knockout play off round begins on Tuesday night. For those who missed the top eight, but not the 24, the next eight days offers a second chance to reach the round of 16, but with altogether less room for wobbles this time around.It was at this stage last year that big names such as Juventus, Milan and Manchester City fell and there will be a few big names intent on avoiding such slip ups this time around. Meanwhile the likes of Qarabag and Bodo/Glimt ready themselves for a first shot at the knockout stages of Europe's most prestigious competition.Before we get to them though, well, there's only one place you can begin. It's Jose Mourinho against one of his former employers. At whatever stage of whatever competition, that's pure box office.1. Can Jose Mourinho deliver another upset?\nNothing can erase the thrills of goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin rising highest at the death to deliver the header that Benfica had just discovered they needed if they were to avoid extend their participation in the Champions League. It was the sort of searing in or out drama that critics said the league phase's final day of 18 different cogs in the machine could not deliver. There is no way of eradicating European football's Jimmy Glass moment.\nIf there were to be one, though, it would probably involve Benfica discovering that the reward for their late win over Real Madrid was to be stomped into the dirt by Real Madrid a few weeks later. After all, Madrid are in so many ways the Michael Jordan of the soccer world. Something, anything happens and \"they took that personally.\" If you don't think that the Real Madrid hierarchy, coaching staff and players saw the joyous scenes at the Estadio da Luz and asked how it affects themselves, the main characters of this universe, then you don't know this club.Before we get to the matter of whether Madrid can inflict payback on Benfica it's probably worth asking what Mourinho can do to them. Let's start by assuming that we are not going to see the same approach from his team that we did in that final league stage game. That was one Benfica had to win to give themselves the best chance of reaching the knockouts. This time, well we've seen enough Mourinho knockout football to know that his basic approach still starts with whoever has the ball is the one that can make the mistakes. \"I'm very used to these kinds of ties,\" he said on Monday. \"I've been doing it all my life.\"There have been some signs in domestic football of Mourinho softening with age. His Benfica side average over two a goals a game in the Primeira Liga but like so much associated with his homeland -- from Viktor Gyokeres' scoring form to how good Porto were in early 2003 -- it's just very hard to realistically assess Mourinho's team in a competition with three near equals and an extremely limited field. Maybe we're better off looking at the limited data pool of the league phase. Looking at the chart below does at least give you a sense of what has been apparent to those who saw Benfica after Mourinho took charge on September 18. The trip to Newcastle aside this was a team who could at least stop the other team from really testing them, allowing only 10.1 non-penalty xG in their eight games. Given that, you'd be hard pressed to believe that Benfica are going to ride out to meet the team their manager calls the \"kings of the Champions League\" in single combat.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            The question then is whether Real Madrid can overwhelm the defenses. The answer is, yes, they probably can. It's not hard to make the case that appointing Alvaro Arbeloa lowered the ceiling that Xabi Alonso had built for this team in his brief tenure, the press and possess system that asked so much of his forwards replaced with something a little more up and down with fewer demands placed on the star forwards. Then again when you allow Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior to freelance the results can be pretty awe-inspiring, especially when it's an in-form Trent Alexander-Arnold getting the ball to them.The latter's presence could be an extremely powerful weapon if Benfica do as expected and sit off Madrid. No one in the sport can slide a cross through a low block like Alexander-Arnold, typified in his stunning cross for Gonzalo Garcia's opener in the 4-1 win over Real Sociedad. Even before his return to the team you could see that Madrid were on the upswing as an attacking force, a function of first Alonso abandoning his system amid player disgruntlement and his sacking effectively handing the reigns to the star players.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Given that this Madrid team will have a point to prove and the attack to eventually hammer down Benfica's defenses, you would be hard pressed to convince yourself of much Mourinho magic this time around. Then again, whoever would have seen Trubiin's late heroics last month?\n2. Are PSG able to peak at the right moment?Twelve months ago, you could see the first signs that something special was bubbling at the Parc des Princes, Paris Saint-Germain coalescing in such a fashion that in a flash they had established themselves as quite clearly the best team on the planet, bound for that Champions League title they had long craved. The only question coming into this season was whether the past few months had been the birth of a dynasty or the sort of magical union of form and fitness that no team could realistically expect to hold up for several years in a row.For most of 2025-26 it looks like the latter has been the more credible. Defeat at Rennes at the weekend saw the champions cede top spot in Ligue 1 to Lens. Meanwhile, two points from their final three league phase games saw Luis Enrique's men fritter away a top eight berth and slide into a second successive play off against French opposition. As the xG charts below show (ignore that hot form early in 2024-25, we're looking at a small data sample) there was a drop off at the start of this season, a serious upswing in the quality and quantity of shots being allowed resulting in a team that looked quite diminished compared to its all-conquering form.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            At least it was easy to explain why PSG had fallen off. After a gruelling summer of Club World Cup commitments, injuries hit hard. Joao Neves, Fabian Ruiz, Marquinhos, Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes all missed time at the start of the season as did Ousmane Dembele. The Ballon d'Or winner, reinvented from mercurial winger into ferocious leader of the pressing pack, was no less critical to the defensive excellence of the Champions League winners than the actual aforementioned defenders. The dip in their attacking oomph was also sustained from the final games of last season, many of which were more nervy than that rout of Inter in the final.\nIt was not just injuries that held back PSG. Luis Enrique seemed to do the same and that is not a critique. The coaching triumph of 2024-25 had been guiding his squad so that their fitness levels collectively peaked when Arsenal and Inter were on their last legs. If a few games had to be thrown early in the season to give his guys a post-Club World Cup breather, surely that would pay dividends in the spring?The signs are that that is indeed the case. Since the return of Dembele and Desire Doue, PSG's offensive output has swung upwards. The defense too has benefitted from more consistently selecting last season's back four. Strange results might still happen -- the 3-1 loss at Rennes saw PSG put up 3.58 xG and allow 1.39 -- but at full tilt this is still a team that should back itself to beat any in Europe.At full tilt is far from given and will require more than just Fabian Ruiz completing his return from a knee issue. It means their star players being fit and settled enough to excel rather than Dembele limping out with 16 minutes to go of the fightback at Rennes, a reminder that fragility has been the default for PSG's star attacker. It also means no more trading of barbs across post-match media from Dembele, who called on players to \"play for the club instead of thinking about themselves,\" and his seemingly less than impressed manager. Europe saw what this team looks like when tensions are frayed in the autumn of 2024. It certainly wasn't a Champions League winner in waiting.\nPSG can be that again and there are signs in the data to suggest they might be so soon. It may, however, require a level of collective fitness that, even with Luis Enrique's careful management, is far from normal at the business end of a season.3. Are Newcastle on upset watch?A final league table that wasn't a million miles away from a European football power rankings means that the playoff round has not thrown up any early showdowns between juggernauts, no re-run of last season's meeting between Real Madrid and Manchester City. That might mean this round lacks something of the high stakes tension that is the Champions League's stock trade in the spring months, but it does afford us the prospect of an upset or two.Galatasaray's meeting with Juventus might be one to keep an eye out on, though it is not entirely clear that any team that features Victor Osimhen and Leroy Sane should consider themselves long shots to win a two-legged tie early in this competition. The forecast in Bodo suggests that Inter will have even more to worry about than just Norway's finest.\nThe more intriguing left-field option might however be Newcastle United's trip to Azerbaijan. After all, Qarabag are seasoned veterans of two-legged European ties and have won eight of their last 10. Even when they haven't emerged victorious they've pushed big beasts like near-invincible Bayer Leverkusen all the way. In this season's league phase only Ajax departed Baku victorious and Chelsea were made to pay the price for Enzo Maresca's rotation in a 2-2 draw where Qarabag might have hoped for more.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            There'll be questions of rotation and resource allocation for Eddie Howe to consider on the 5,000 mile round trip to a city that is nearer to Delhi than Newcastle. That's a long journey to recover from by 3 p.m. ET on Saturday, when Newcastle are due at Manchester City, trying to stay in the hunt for qualification to next year's European competitions. Following the news that star player Bruno Guimaraes would miss up to two months with a hamstring injury, Sven Botman and Yoanne Wissa missed the FA Cup fourth round tie against Aston Villa, propelling the Magpies' injury list to eight players. Now even without all those players they were able to win well at Villa Park and any team that rolls out the likes of Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon should be favorites against Qarabag. Still this might prove to be a fiddlier first leg than it looks, potentially setting the stage for a nerve-wracking night at St. James' Park next week.\n            ",

That doesn't mean Judge is content with his game. Rather, he's looking to add a new dimension this year.\"Baserunning's on my mind this year a lot,\" Judge told reporters on Monday. \"I saw a lot of guys around the league with 40, 30 bases that you don't usually normally expect to be running that much. Especially with how the game's changed with the pickoffs and the pitch clock, I think that's one way we can utilize, or, at least, I can utilize some of my skills a little bit more, getting into scoring position.\"With the lineup we have, this was probably the best offense in all of baseball last year. If I can find a way to get myself in scoring position, if they're going to walk me or do something, then some good things are going to happen.\"\nTo Judge's point, 17 different players swiped at least 30 bases in 2025. That group included the likes of Juan Soto (38) and Josh Naylor (30), neither of whom fits the conventional picture of a high-volume thief. In fact, Soto and Naylor both finished in the 13th percentile or worse in Statcast's sprint speed, suggesting their steals were the products of their smarts -- and their leveraging of the aforementioned pickoff limit and pitch clock rules -- instead of their wheels. Judge, for comparison, ranked in the 42nd percentile in that measure, which helps to explain why he's been a legitimate center-field option for the Yankees in the past despite his size.\nJudge, 33, has never stolen more than 16 bases in a single campaign despite succeeding at around a 75% clip. The key matter for the Yankees is whether or not the additional value he'd provide in running more often would be worth the downside of increasing his injury risk. Given how much Judge produces at the plate (he's hit .312/.445/.674 and averaged 49 home runs over the last three years), the Yankees can be excused if they decide by Opening Day to give him the red light just as often as in the past.\n            \n    ",

They controlled play in the first period, but an excellent effort from Swedish goaltender Ebba Svensson Traff kept the score close. That was followed by a red, white and blue avalanche in the second period.Thanks to three goals on three shots in under three minutes, the Americans blew the game wide open and took a 5-0 lead into the third period. From there, the U.S. put it in cruise control with the final in sight.\nThis blowout win over Sweden was a team effort for the U.S. as five different players found the back of the net and 13 different players registered a point. The only two players to find the scoresheet multiple times were Hannah Bilka and Abbey Murphy. The former tallied two assists, and the latter notched one goal and one helper.The Americans have simply been a runaway train in these Olympics, and they haven't allowed a goal since the second period of their opening game against Finland.

In the last week alone, the conference has given the country Arizona vs. Kansas, Texas Tech vs. Arizona and Kansas vs. Iowa State.On Monday night, the Big 12 will stage another scintillating showdown when the No. 2 Houston Cougars and the No. 6 Iowa State Cyclones collide at Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa.The Cougars (23-2, 11-1 in Big 12) lead the Big 12 by one game over Arizona (23-2, 10-2). They have won six in a row behind freshman guard Kingston Flemings and a suffocating defense that ranks second in the country with 61.3 points per game allowed. Meanwhile, the Cyclones (22-3, 9-3) are tied for third in the Big 12. They are coming off an 18-point blowout win over Kansas on Saturday, which was their biggest victory over the Jayhawks since 1973. The win also improved Iowa State's home record to 14-0 this season. The Cyclones are 2.5-point favorites over the Cougars on Monday.While Houston vs. Iowa State is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a partial college basketball schedule.

The Blue Devils (23-2, 12-1 in ACC) lead the conference by one game over Virginia (22-3, 10-2). Duke is anchored by likely national player of the year Cameron Boozer, who ranks fifth in the country in scoring (22.8 points per game) and 14th in rebounding (9.9 per game). On Monday, he and the Blue Devils will take on a Syracuse team that has been relatively mediocre defensively this season, ranking 130th in the nation in points per game allowed (72.2). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says there's a 73% chance the teams combine for 143 points or more and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 142.5.No. 2 Houston at No. 6 Iowa StateTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 134.5 | Expert: Houston +2.5 (Micah Roberts)\nBecause both of these teams are known for their defenses, the offenses have been overshadowed. The Cougars rank 12th in the country in offensive rating (125.0 points per 100 possessions), according to KenPom, while the Cyclones (123.9) are 17th. Both teams feature players who can fill it up. Flemings (16.4 points per game) is on pace to break the program record for single-season scoring average by a freshman. Meanwhile, Iowa State's Milan Momcilovic leads the country in 3-point percentage (51.6). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's an 80.4% chance the teams combine for 135 points or more and gives a \"B\" grade to Over 134.5. Looking aheadChampions League: Atalanta at Borussia DortmundTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Dortmund | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 2.5 | Expert: Over 2.5 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo teams on a roll square off in the first leg of a Champions League knockout phase playoff when Borussia Dortmund and Atalanta face off at Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund have won their last six matches in the Bundesliga to move into second place in the table. Atalanta, which installed Raffaele Palladino as coach midseason, have six wins and two draws over their last eight matches in Serie A. \"My belief is that with this being a two-legged playoff, Dortmund are going to press heavily at home in this first leg, knowing that playing in Italy is going to be tough,\" Eimer says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It projects 3.3 total goals and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 2.5.Paris Saint-Germain at MonacoTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Monaco | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: PSG -188 | Expert: PSG -1 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo French sides will meet in European competition for the first time when Monaco host PSG at Stade Louis II. PSG sit in second place in the Ligue 1 table with 51 points, behind only Lens (52). Monaco are eighth with 31 points. At the end of November, Monaco stunned PSG 1-0 in a Ligue 1 match in Monaco. But the reigning league champions currently lead Ligue 1 in both goals (49) and goal differential (+30). \"PSG will be desperate for the chance to correct that abysmal 1-0 loss,\" Eimer says.

    "body": "\nThe second year pf the new format of the UEFA Champions League, brought plenty of chaos on the final day of the league phase as 18 matches kicked off at the same time. Storylines can get muddled along the way during a jam-packed period of action but one stood out above the rest, fully embodying the drama of the day.Real Madrid started the day well-positioned to finish in the top eight and book a direct spot in the round of 16, a favorable match against a Benfica team who were poised for elimination awaiting them. The script fully flipped, though -- Benfica came out with an improbable 4-2 win, rounded out by a red card for Real Madrid's Raul Asencio and the final goal of the game coming from shot-stopper Anatoliy Trubin. Benfica, coached by ex-Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, snuck their way into the knockout phase playoffs while Los Blancos were doomed to play another two games in the hopes of booking a spot in the last 16.It makes for an unusual but perfect set-up for a rematch three weeks later, a painful reward for Benfica despite their hard work and a golden opportunity for Real Madrid to fully put that Matchday 8 defeat behind them.How to watch Benfica vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Tuesday, Feb. 16 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio da Luz -- Lisbon, PortugalLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Benfica +280; Draw +290; Real Madrid -115Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

We will play the first leg with our heads, with ambition and confidence. We know what we did to the kings of the Champions League … Real Madrid is Real Madrid, with history, knowledge, ambition. The only comparable thing is that we are two giants. Beyond that, there is nothing else. But football has this power and we can win.\"The circumstances could see Mourinho change his approach from the teams' last meeting, too. Benfica were more forward-thinking than usual in their win over Los Blancos, in large part because they simply needed to score to even have a shot at advancing, but the calculus is usually different over a two-legged tie. A team can attempt to grind the opponent down in an attempt to lock their attack out, something Mourinho teams have done time and time again. Benfica's attack-focused approach on Matchday 8 was atypical to their Champions League experiences since Mourinho took over after a Matchday 1 loss to Qarabag – they performed well above their average of 14.1 shots per game and 1.5 expected goals, instead taking 22 shots and generating 3.01 expected goals. Even with the 3-2 defeat to Qarabag factored in, Benfica are a solid defensive side – they have conceded just 10.1 nonpenalty expected goals against in eight games.The question, then, is if this imperfect version of Real Madrid can find a way to break through a tough defense. Even in a season full of ups and downs, it feels hard to bet against the Spanish giants. They rank inside the Champions League's top five for goals with 21 and expected goals with 18.99, their sheer ability to score papering over a handful of cracks. That is especially true since Xabi Alonso's January ouster as the coach, his mission to build a more balanced Real Madrid abandoned despite the progress he made. Since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge, Los Blancos have fully switched to a strategy in which Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior share the field at the same time, kicking the can down the road on the longstanding question about the pair's compatibility.Both in Spain and in Europe, Real Madrid's inherent attacking might is enough to survive their own inconsistencies and notch enough wins to keep them in the conversation for silverware. Mbappe himself is on pace for a career-best season with 39 goals across all competitions so far, while Vinicius has delivered since Arbeloa took charge with four goals and two assists in his last seven matches. Individually, the pair are a cheat code as Los Blancos continue to sort through their issues and will be enough of a challenge for Benfica's defense over the next week and change.The team, though, has received a boost in the return of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who notched his first start since December in Real Madrid's 4-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday. He will provide some attacking balance for a team that is at times overly reliant on Mbappe, already providing a preview of what's to come with an assist over the weekend. The England international is a uniquely creative player as a right back, though his range of passing and positional awareness means he can kickstart an attack from just about every area of the pitch.For all their flaws, Real Madrid have a perfect opportunity to put a sizable loss behind them, even if they are still unwilling to answer the big problems that plague their squad – and their pursuit of trophies, for that matter.\n            ",

Michigan jumped Arizona for the top spot in the updated rankings. The Wildcats previously stood as one of two remaining undefeated teams before they went 0-2 last week with losses against Kansas and Texas Tech.Michigan received 60 of the 61 possible first-place votes this week. Houston received the other first-place vote.The last time Michigan ranked No. 1 in the AP poll was during the week of Jan. 28, 2013. That year, the Wolverines reached the national title game before falling to Louisville. Since 1993 -- the last year of Michigan's iconic \"Fab Five\" -- the Wolverines held the top spot in the poll only twice.Michigan (24-1) is off to its best 25-game start in school history.

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture, including the Daytona 500. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $100 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet, Win or LoseCBSSPORTS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel and DraftKings require a user's first bet to win, while bet365 provides bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets, but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook that consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there are season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

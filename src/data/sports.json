The Oregon vs. Indiana matchup features two undefeated Big Ten teams with championship aspirations. According to the latest Week 7 <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/odds/\" target=\"_blank\">college football odds</a>, the Ducks are favored by 7.5 points at home, while the over/under for total points scored is 55.5.

Indiana features the nation's third-ranked scoring defense, giving up 9.60 points per game this season, but the Hoosiers have yet to face an offense as explosive as Oregon's. The Ducks are scoring 46.6 points per game, and quarterback Dante Moore is a Heisman Trophy candidate with 1,210 passing yards, 14 touchdowns and just one interception. The model is projecting Oregon to cover the spread in 59% of simulations, providing clear value on the spread. </p><h2>Georgia -3.5 vs. Auburn</h2><p>Georgia has dominated this rivalry in recent years, winning eight straight against the Tigers.

Eric Morris is clearly finding traction in his third season, as the Mean Green rank eighth in FBS in scoring (44.8 ppg) entering the week. Meanwhile, South Florida also had a signature win over Florida, but that might have been more about the Gators (2-3). <strong>The model has North Texas covering in 64% of simulations</strong>.</p><p>Mariners +100 vs. Tigers</p><p>\"This game represents a potential redemption opportunity for Tarik Skubal, who struggled in last year's Game 5 against Cleveland, allowing five runs in a crushing defeat. The Mariners have solved Tarik Skubal three times in four tries this season, including twice at home. His 5.91 ERA is the highest against any team with a minimum of 10 innings pitched this season,\" <strong>SportsLine handicapper Jeff Hochman said</strong>. \"Seattle has thrived at T-Mobile Park with a 100-62 record over the past two seasons - the third-best home mark in baseball. George Kirby has always pitched better at home (3.10 ERA) than on the road (4.14) over his four-year career. Skubal is a \"beast\" who has logged 209.3 IP this season. Give me the home underdog in this winner-take-all affair.\"</p><p>Colorado State +6.5 vs. Fresno State (-110)</p><p>Colorado State is desperate to turn its season around after losing four of its first five games. The Rams are coming off their highest-scoring game of the campaign, racking up 24 points against San Diego State last week. Freshman running back Jalen Dupree had 103 rushing yards on 16 carries, averaging 6.4 yards per carry.

As was the case last year, Crown Jewel will be anchored by matches between WWE's top men's and women's champions for the honorary Crown Jewel championship. It all goes down from the RAC Arena on Saturday night in Perth.</p><p>For the men, that means a match between world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins and undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes. The women's Crown Jewel championship match is now set as women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer will take on WWE women's champion Tiffany Stratton.</p><p>In addition, John Cena returns for one of his final appearances when he takes on AJ Styles as the two revisit one of the promotion's top rivalries of the 2010s. Cena has been out of action since Wrestlepalooza and only has a handful of appearances booked through the end of the year, when he is expected to retire. Styles, meanwhile, also recently said he expects to retire by the end of 2026.</p><p>Plus, roman Reigns makes his return to a PPV card when he takes on Bronson Reed in n Australian Street Fight. And Asuka and Kairi Sane are set to team up and face Iyo Sky and Rhea Ripley.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-hall-of-fame-2026-stephanie-mcmahon-becomes-first-inductee-to-next-class-after-undertakers-surprise/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/4c7f6d7d-c427-484b-a45e-757c38e65b74/thumbnail/270x152/0f4cca3123a1cf94fb4f003fa58c11d7/pay14-photo-190.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Let's take a look at what we know -- and what we expect -- from Crown Jewel, which takes place Oct. 11 from RAC Arena in Perth, Australia.</p><h2>2025 WWE Crown Jewel matches</h2><p><strong>Men's Crown Jewel Championship</strong> <strong>-- Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins:</strong> Rhodes and Rollins came face-to-face shortly after Wrestlepalooza, knowing the champion vs. champion match was more or less locked in. Rollins has questioned what Rhodes thinks of him and his \"vision\" for the future of wrestling, while Rhodes has questioned why Rollins needs the backup of \"goons\" if he's the best in the world. These two have a fairly lengthy history, dating back to Rhodes being Rollins' surprise opponent at WrestleMania 38 in Rhodes' return to WWE.</p><p><strong>Women's Crown Jewel Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer vs. Tiffany Stratton:</strong> Vaquer won the women's world championship at Wrestlepalooza in a terrific match with Iyo Sky for the vacant title. Now, she takes on Stratton as she has reigned as WWE women's champion since the beginning of the year. She's coming off a brutal triple threat match against Jade Cargill and Nia Jax on SmackDown on Sept. 26 that left Cargill badly cut. Vaquer and Stratton will now cross paths for the first time in their careers.</p>\n<p><strong>AJ Styles vs. John Cena:</strong> Cena and Styles had some fantastic matches around 2017. Those matches were among the best of Cena's entire career. That is pretty much the entire storyline of why this match is happening, with no real animosity or storyline beyond. Of course, maybe Cena has to deal with a surprise attack from someone like Brock Lesnar once again as his final days in WWE wind down.</p><p><strong>Roman Reigns vs. Bronson Reed (Australian Street Fight):</strong> Reed and Reigns met at Clash in Paris, with Reigns winning before Reed unleashed an onslaught after the match, taking Reigns out of action. Reigns recently returned and Reed, with Paul Heyman by his side, wanted to run it back, though this time in a match type that Reed \"made famous.\" Reigns was happy to accept and the rematch is on, and this time with no rules.</p><p><strong>Asuka & Kairi Sane vs. Iyo Sky & Rhea Ripley:</strong> After weeks of teasing a split, Asuka finally turned on Sky after Sky protected Ripley following an Asuka mist attack. Sane has sided with Asuka because she claims Asuka is why Sane and Sky are in WWE. After Sane and Asuka offered Sky a chance to apologize and return to her \"family,\" Sky was the next to suffer an Asuka mist attack. That was the last straw for Sky, who had struggled to break away from Asuka, and the Crown Jewel tag match was official.</p>\n            </div>",

No deal is imminent, but those talks follow a meeting Pujols had on Thursday with general manager Perry Minasian.</p><p>Right after the regular season concluded, the Angels announced that neither manager Ron Washington nor interim skipper Ray Montgomery would return to their dugout in 2026. Montgomery, of course, filled in for Washington when the latter was on medical leave.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/albert-pujols-angels-manager-owner-arte-moreno-reportedly-wants-future-all-star-as-next-skipper/\">Pujols was subsequently named as owner Arte Moreno's preferred candidate to take over</a>. It's worth noting that Pujols remains employed by the Angels. The contract he signed with the club as a player included a 10-year personal-services pact upon his retirement. Pujols has essentially served as an ambassador for the organization since walking away after the 2022 season. (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> has since banned personal service contracts, and it's unclear how it would factor in here.)</p>\n<p>Pujols, 45, remains slated to manage the Dominican Republic in next spring's World Baseball Classic.

The team will move Sanders to the season-ending injured reserve as he deals with knee and ankle issues. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46554845/cowboys-rb-miles-sanders-season-ending-surgery-knee\">According to ESPN's Todd Archer</a>, it is the knee ailment that will keep Sanders on the shelf for the rest of the year as he is set to undergo a chondral tissue graft surgery. It is the same procedure Cowboys cornerback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2252834/trevon-diggs/\">Trevon Diggs</a> had in January.</p><p>Sanders did not play in Week 5 against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, and while he attempted to practice on Wednesday, he left the session early. Sanders also missed time in training camp with a bruised knee and sat out of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/schedule/\">preseason game</a> with a shoulder issue.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, at the end of the day, attrition will get you,\" Jones said. \"We just found out we're going to lose Sanders for the year, our running back. These things have a way of spots opening up.\"</p><p>Sanders joined the Cowboys in March as a free agent. He signed a one-year deal after being cut by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a> two seasons into a four-year contract. Sanders enjoyed a prolific run with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> before his Panthers tenure and for his career boasts 4,462 rushing yards and 24 touchdowns.</p>\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28875227/jaydon-blue/\">Jaydon Blue</a> to climb Cowboys depth chart</h2><p>While Sanders' injury is a blow to the Cowboys' running back group, it does also provide an opportunity for rookie ballcarrier Jaydon Blue, who made his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> debut last week in Sanders' absence. The Texas product and fifth-round pick handled four carries for seven yards but could see a larger role in the weeks to come.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961719/javonte-williams/\">Javonte Williams</a> remains the featured back in the Dallas offense and already has 447 yards and five touchdowns to his name this season. Blue will form a one-two-punch with the fifth-year veteran as the Cowboys seek to maintain the NFL's most productive offense by yardage.</p>\n<p>\"We're so fired up about what Jaydon Blue can do for this offense,\" Jones said. \"He's got rare explosiveness. I know Coach Schottenheimer and his offensive staff are going to certainly continue to figure out the best way to use him. I think he's really going to bring something to this offense at the running back position that we haven't had. As much as I respect and think a lot of Sanders, I think at the end of the day, Blue can really bring some more juice to this offense.\"</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>An Oct. 25 pay-per-view card in Las Vegas, headlined by WBC junior middleweight titleholder Sebastian Fundora and former two-time welterweight champion Keith Thurman, has been postponed, Premier Boxing Champions announced on Friday. </p><p>PBC confirmed the initial report from Mike Coppinger of \"The Ring\" that Fundora (23-1-1, 15 KOs), the 6-foot-5 ½ \"Towering Inferno,\" suffered a hand contusion in sparring that forced him to withdraw. The PPV card, originally set for the MGM Grand Garden Arena, will be postponed to a later date, PBC said.  </p><p>After sitting out most of 2024 following his breakthrough, short-notice victory over Tim Tszyu by split decision to unify 154-pound titles in a bloody war, Fundora has been red hot this calendar year in one of the sport's deepest divisions. Fighting out of Coachella, California, Fundora returned in March to stop Chordale Booker inside of two rounds before vacating his WBO title in order to face Tszyu in an all-action rematch that ended via TKO after Round 7 when the battered Australian star was asked out of the fight. </p>\n<p>Fundora's injury proved to be yet another setback in the multi-year comeback of Thurman, who was forced to pull out of the March 2024 fight against Tszyu with an injury, allowing Fundora to replace him after moving up from the undercard. Although Thurman would go on to snap a three-year layoff in March when he traveled to Australia to Brock Jarvis inside of three rounds, his plans to finally face Tszyu were spoiled when Fundora got the call, instead, for their rematch. </p><p>Thurman, who turns 37 in November, has fought just twice in the past six years. He rebounded from a 2019 welterweight title loss to Manny Pacquiao via split decision by returning nearly three years later to widely outpoint future titleholder Mario Barrios in a 2022 PPV headliner. </p>\n<p>The Oct. 25 card, which was set to air on Prime Video PPV, also brings with it the postponement of the co-main event, a 130-pound title bout between WBC titleholder O'Shaquie Foster and two-division champion Stephen Fulton Jr. The fight was originally expected to serve as the co-feature to a proposed Aug. 16 PPV headlined by a Gervonta Davis-Lamont Roach Jr. rematch that never came to fruition. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Charles Oliveira is coming home. Oliveira fights in his home nation of Brazil for the first time since 2020 on Saturday. Lightweight contender Mateusz Gamrot assumes the antagonist role in their UFC Fight Night headliner.</p><p>Oliveira (35-11) last fought in Brazil five years ago where he beat Kevin Lee in the final event before the COVID-19 shutdowns. The fight took place in an empty arena, meaning \"Do Bronx\" hasn't fought in front of Brazilian fans for six years. It's bittersweet to think that the entirety of Oliveira's title campaign -- in which he finished Michael Chandler, Dustin Poirier, and Justin Gaethje to become a fan-favorite star -- took place outside of his home nation. Oliveira <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-317-results-highlights-ilia-topuria-knocks-out-charles-oliveira-to-claim-second-ufc-title-at-lightweight/live/\" target=\"_blank\">returns home empty-handed</a>, but he's eager to parlay a win over Gamrot into <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/charles-oliveira-calls-out-max-holloway-for-bmf-title-fight-after-ufc-fight-night-in-rio/\" target=\"_blank\">a ceremonial BMF title fight with Max Holloway</a></span>, which he in turn hopes gets him another crack at the UFC title.</p><p>\"It's for my legacy,\" Oliveira <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qE7s29Qbs&t=2s\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter when asked why he demanded to fight on this card. \"To be in front of my fans and feel the energy of the Brazilian people.\"</p><p>Gamrot (25-3) has been waiting for a fight like this. Possibly the division's best wrestler, Gamrot is not deterred by Oliveira's ultra-dangerous Brazilian jiu-jitsu. If anything, he's excited to face a rare opponent who will indulge in grappling. External factors give Gamrot a surge of confidence. Oliveira was originally preparing to fight a very different opponent in Rafael Fiziev, an elite striker, before Gamrot stepped in. Additionally, Gamrot sees Arman Tsarukyan's success against Oliveira as a telling sign ahead of Saturday's fight.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/alex-pereira-suffers-broken-foot-in-win-over-magomed-ankalaev-opponent-entered-with-rib-injury-per-report/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Alex Pereira suffers broken foot in win over Magomed Ankalaev; opponent entered with rib injury, per report</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Alex Pereira suffers broken foot in win over Magomed Ankalaev; opponent entered with rib injury, per report\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/a1459888-ea56-48ac-814b-05406e9e74a8/thumbnail/270x152/ab8d97078159ab4bf638d28fbc604943/alex-pereira-ufc-320-magomed-ankalaev-injury-mma-news-today-cbs-sports-oct-7-2025.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>\"Oliveira doesn't like wrestlers,\" Gamrot told CBS Sports. \"He's the most dangerous guy on the ground. I understand people don't want to go to the ground with him. But not me. Wrestling and BJJ are in my DNA. </p><p>\"I love exchanging submissions and grappling. I'm happy because my previous opponents always try to stand up. Charles Oliveira will try to submit me or scramble with me.\"</p><p><strong><em>Check out the full interview with Mateusz Gamrot below.</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Saturday's Fight Night has a few worthwhile matchups and plenty of Brazilian representation for the home crowd. Two-time flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo continues his bantamweight campaign against rising contender Montel Jackson. Figueriedo returns after suffering a knee injury loss to Cory Sandhagen, in the fight preceding <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-results-merab-dvalishvili-grinds-through-cory-sandhagen-to-retain-bantamweight-championship/\" target=\"_blank\">Sandhagen's title shot against Merab Dvalishvili</a> at UFC 320. Jackson is on a six-fight winning streak in pursuit of his biggest win to date.</p>\n<p>Let's take a closer look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a> before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event.</p><h2> UFC Fight Night card, odds </h2><p>Odds via DraftKings</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Favorite<br /> </th><th>Underdog<br /> </th><th>Weight class</th></tr><tr><td>Mateusz Gamrot -115</td><td>Charles Oliveira -105</td><td>Lightweight</td></tr><tr><td>Montel Jackson -325<br /></td><td>Deiveson Figuereido +260</td><td>Bantamweight</td></tr><tr><td>Joel Alvarez -535</td><td>Vicente Luque +400</td><td>Welterweight</td></tr><tr><td>Jhonata Diniz -142</td><td>Mario Pinto +120</td><td>Heavyweight</td></tr><tr><td>Ricardo Ramos -198</td><td>Kaan Ofli +164</td><td>Featherweight  </td></tr><tr><td>Michael Aswell Jr. -162<br /></td><td>Lucas Almeida +136</td><td>Featherweight</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>UFC Fight Night viewing information </h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Oct. 11 | <strong>Start time:</strong> 7 p.m. ET (main card)<br /> <strong>Location:</strong> Farmasi Arena -- Rio de Janeiro<br /> <strong>TV channel: </strong>ESPN+</p><h2> Prediction </h2><p><strong>Charles Oliveira vs. Mateusz Gamrot:</strong> It's easy to picture Gamrot neutralizing Oliveira. The Polish fighter, representing American Top Team, might have the best pure wrestling in the division. Gamrot averages more than five takedowns per 15 minutes, while Oliveira gives up more than half the attempts on him. Oliveira's razor-sharp submission game takes the pressure off defending takedowns, but Gamrot has the skills to avoid being tapped. Don't forget: Gamrot beat Tsarukyan in a brilliant five-round grappling display. What Oliveira has going for him is a two-pronged threat. He's an incredibly potent offensive striker, and his questionable striking defense won't come back to bite him in this fight. Oliveira can replicate and build on the striking success Dan Hooker had against Gamrot. Admittedly, I am concerned that Oliveira couldn't finish Chandler over 25 minutes last year. My head says Gamrot, but my heart says Oliveira, and few people exemplify heart like \"Do Bronx.\" <strong><em>Oliveira via KO3</em></strong></p>\n            </div>",

The decision will not be made official until after the World Series, when the offseason begins. Bellinger will be due a $5 million buyout, so it's really a $20 million decision.</p><p>\"Yeah, absolutely,\" Bellinger <a href=\"https://x.com/snyyankees/status/1976129365143404840\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> after the Yankees were eliminated in the ALDS when asked if he would be open to returning to the team in 2026. \"I had an unbelievable time putting on this uniform. Yankee Stadium, the  fans, the organization, the culture that these guys have created in  this locker room. It really is special.\"</p><p>Bellinger, 30, had a terrific season in New York, hitting .272/.334/.480 with 29 homers and 3 stolen bases while seamlessly bouncing around the outfield. He played at least 40 games in all three outfield spots and played some first base as well. The 29 home runs are his most since his NL MVP season in 2019, and his 5.0 WAR was his best since 2019 as well.</p>\n<p>The Yankees acquired Bellinger in a salary dump trade with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> as part of their Plan B pivot after losing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/\">Juan Soto</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3152852/cody-poteet/\">Cody Poteet</a>, the right-hander the Yankees sent the Cubs in the trade, was designated for assignment in spring training. For all intents and purposes, the Yankees picked up a 5.0 WAR outfielder for free in the offseason.</p>\n<p>Because he received (and rejected) the qualifying offer two years ago, the Yankees can not make Bellinger the qualifying offer again, and will not receive draft pick compensation should he sign elsewhere. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184451/trent-grisham/\">Trent Grisham</a> will be a free agent as well and a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/whats-next-for-yankees-after-mlb-playoff-elimination-aaron-judges-team-faces-questions-as-drought-continues/\" target=\"_blank\">center fielder will be a top priority for New York this winter</a></span>.

The four Scott Boras clients were unable to secure long-term contracts that offseason and instead settled for one-year deals with player options. Chapman and Snell have since signed long-term deals. Bellinger will now try to do the same.</p>\n<p>The Yankees went 94-68 during the regular season, then were ousted in four games by the AL East rival <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in the ALDS.

But to reach this point in the playoffs, it takes more than simply being a winning driver and a winning race team. By making it to the Round of 8, eight drivers and teams have exhibited that they were among the very finest in all of auto racing and deserve the right to try and get to NASCAR's finale with a shot at winning the Cup Series championship. Now, it's a matter of taking advantage of that right.</p><p>With four races to go in the season, the Round of 8 of the NASCAR playoffs begins with the first opportunity for the remaining playoff drivers to win a race and make the Championship 4 coming this weekend in the South Point 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Of the eight remaining drivers in the playoffs, one in particular knows exactly what this race can do for him. In 2022 and again last year, Joey Logano won this race to earn his Championship 4 berth, which he seized upon both times to win at Phoenix and win the Cup championship.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nascar/news/nascar-2025-race-schedule-results-complete-list-of-cup-series-race-dates-winners-tracks-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks</p>\n                <p>\n                    Steven Taranto                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/06/453f29b0-8904-4579-8167-903cb125a451/thumbnail/270x152/7c5fbfaf8dd5806dc181a797f3277bd4/gettyimages-2239429823.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Having been the last driver to make the Round of 8 on points, the defending champ's presence in the penultimate round of the playoffs looms large over the rest of the field. And for Denny Hamlin, Ryan Blaney, Kyle Larson, William Byron, Christopher Bell, Chase Briscoe and Chase Elliott, the pressure is on to strike first before Logano gets the opportunity to spoil their hopes of taking his crown.</p><h2>Where to watch the NASCAR playoffs at Las Vegas</h2><ul><li><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, Oct. 12 | <strong>Time:</strong> 5:30 p.m. ET</li><li><strong>Where:</strong> Las Vegas Motor Speedway -- Las Vegas, Nev.</li><li><strong>TV:</strong> USA | <strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191277?irad=356362&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)   </li></ul><h2>Storyline to watch</h2><p>Despite major efforts being taken to stamp out playoff race manipulation after the finish to last year's Martinsville elimination race, the finish to last week's race at the Charlotte Roval saw team and OEM orders yet again play a factor in the battle for the final spot above the cut line to advance to the Round of 8. In the hours that followed the finish and Joey Logano's triumph over Ross Chastain in the cut line battle, radio communications on both Cole Custer and Alex Bowman's teams while they were trailing Logano and Bowman respectively were the subject of examination and heavy questioning.</p>\n<p>After Custer followed Logano -- a fellow Ford -- through traffic and made one attempt to pass him with four laps to go, Custer's spotter Andy Houston was heard being asked if he had his \"watch on\" after Custer crossed the start/finish line to take three laps to go. At that point, a message of \"nice and easy\" was relayed to Custer, with the directive to try and save his tires in case of a late-race restart.</p><p>While the optics of the radio communications relative to the situation made it seem as though Custer was receiving orders to stand down and not pass Logano, there was at least some plausible deniability inherent in Haas Factory Team's messaging. The messaging over Alex Bowman's radio was slightly more clumsy, as he was reminded to save his tires -- on the final lap -- the moment he got to Ross Chastain's bumper to challenge him for position. Bowman never seriously challenged Chastain for position from that point onward, instead leaving a comfortable gap between his car and the fellow Chevrolet of Chastain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-the-xfinity-finishing-order-took-so-long-and/id1795918832?i=1000730841381\" target=\"_blank\">Speaking on <em>Hauler Talk</em> this week</a>, NASCAR's Mike Forde shared that officials felt that neither the No. 41 or No. 48 team's radio communications rose to the level that a penalty was necessary. However, NASCAR does plan to meet with teams this week in the leadup to the race at Las Vegas to remind them that race manipulation and particularly blatant actions by teams and/or manufacturers to ensure that their drivers advance to the Championship 4 will not be tolerated.</p>\n<p>\"At a certain point during this week, we will just remind teams if they need a reminder 'let's not put yourselves or ourselves in jeopardy here,'\" Forde said. \"Fans should be coming to the racetrack and expecting a straight up race where each position is fought for as hard as possible, especially at the end of a race. If we do see something or hear something we don't like, we are going to step in... So we are aware, and I think come this week -- Vegas and Talladega maybe not as much so, but certainly Martinsville we'll be on high alert again. And if we hear something, we will certainly react if necessary.\"</p><p>As a result of last year's Martinsville cutoff race -- <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nascar/news/nascar-suspends-nine-people-hands-out-600k-in-fines-after-teams-manipulated-finish-at-martinsville/\" target=\"_blank\">which saw NASCAR suspend nine and hand out $600k in fines</a></span> after multiple teams tried to manipulate the outcome of the battle for the final Championship 4 spot between Christopher Bell and William Byron -- NASCAR has been much more vigilant in monitoring team actions and communications in this year's playoffs. For instance, NASCAR officials warned two Xfinity Series teams -- both of which had already advanced to the Round of 8 -- not to discuss the points scenarios for teams that had yet to advance over their team radios, as had happened in last week's elimination race in Charlotte.</p><p>Exactly where each playoff contender stands relative to the cut line on points likely won't be as much of a factor in the opening race of the Round of 8 at Las Vegas, but it certainly will be worth monitoring in the final two before the Championship 4 is settled.</p>\n<h2>NASCAR news of the week</h2><ul><li>Judge Kenneth Bell has ordered NASCAR, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports to participate in a settlement conference on Oct. 21, a move which comes shortly after NASCAR asked the Western District Court of North Carolina to order the parties to participate in a judicial settlement conference. The move opens up the possibility of the teams' ongoing antitrust lawsuit against the sanctioning body being settled before it is set to go to trial on Dec. 1. Representatives for 23XI and Front Row, however, <a href=\"https://racer.com/2025/10/07/23xi-front-row-respond-to-nascar-settlement-conference-request\" target=\"_blank\">accused NASCAR's request for a settlement conference</a> of being \"another effort to play to the court of public opinion\" and not an effort toward resolution.</li><li>NASCAR officially announced this week that they will be increasing horsepower in 2026, moving from 670 to 750 HP for Cup Series cars at all ovals less than 1.5 miles and all road courses. The full list of tracks that will see a power increase include Bowman Gray Stadium, Circuit of the Americas, Phoenix Raceway,  Darlington Raceway, Martinsville Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway,  Watkins Glen International, Dover Motor Speedway, Nashville  Superspeedway, San Diego Street Course, Sonoma Raceway, North Wilkesboro  Speedway, Iowa Speedway, Richmond Raceway, New Hampshire Motor  Speedway, World Wide Technology Raceway and Charlotte Motor Speedway  Road Course. </li><li>AM Racing announced that Harrison Burton will not return to their Xfinity Series team in 2026, ending a one-year run that came after Burton returned to the Xfinity level following three seasons in Cup. In one season with AM Racing, Burton earned two top fives, 10 top 10s, and made the playoffs before being eliminated at the end of the Round of 12.</li><li>Finalists for the Comcast Community Champion of the Year award, the most prestigious annual award honoring philanthropic efforts of those across the NASCAR industry, have been announced. This year's finalists include former NASCAR Xfinity Series director Wayne Auton (The Corner Table), Bristol Motor Speedway general manager Jerry Caldwell (Speedway Children's Charities, Bristol chapter), and NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Daniel Dye (Race to Stop Suicide).</li></ul><h2>Pick to win</h2><p><strong>Christopher Bell (+500 at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>)</strong> – The past two years in a row, this race has served as Christopher Bell's stumbling block on his way to trying to win a Cup championship. In both 2023 and 2024, Bell finished a narrow second, and last year was particularly painful in that Bell had dominated the entire race only to lose to Joey Logano on strategy, a loss which ended up having massive consequences when Bell fell apart at Martinsville and missed the Championship 4 entirely.</p><p>Bell has found himself in a big spot in both of his last two Vegas starts, as he entered the spring race looking to win four in a row after rattling off three straight wins at the start of the year. Bell ended up only running 12th, and his Bristol win a month ago has been his lone victory since his hot streak to begin the year. But with five top 10s in a row including consecutive third-place finishes, it appears the time is nigh for Bell to claim a Championship 4 spot and potentially the Cup championship he missed out on a year ago.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                                            </div>",

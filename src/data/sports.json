On Monday, coach Dan Quinn revealed that while Daniels' injury is not \"significant or long-term,\" his status for next Monday's showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs is uncertain. \"I'll have a better sense as I get closer to it, with the extra day and what that looks like,\" Quinn said. \"But the good news came back that it's not a long-term thing ... but I'll have a better feel for you guys when we get to Thursday.\"Daniels missed time earlier this season with a knee sprain, and the Commanders went 1-1 with backup Marcus Mariota at the helm. The concern with a hamstring is always the potential to aggravate it or make it worse by hurrying back too quickly, but with an extra day to recover before playing Monday night, there is a possibility Daniels is able to go against the red-hot Chiefs. As Quinn noted, we likely won't get a full status update on Daniels until later in the week, but the fact that the MRI didn't show anything significant is a positive update for a Commanders team that needed some good injury news for once. \nThe offense has dealt with injuries to their top receivers along with Daniels, as Deebo Samuel, Terry McLaurin and Noah Brown all missed Sunday's game in Dallas, while the defense just lost sack leader Dorrance Armstrong for the season with a knee injury. \n            \n    ",

The Mariners are one win away from their first pennant and trip to the World Series, but they missed a chance to punch their ticket to the Fall Classic on Sunday night.The Jays won Game 6 behind big showings from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Trey Yesavage and put themselves one win away from the franchise's first World Series trip since 1993. The Dodgers, meanwhile, completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday night and will have a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. They'll try to become the first team to win back-to-back titles since the New York Yankees won three in a row from 1998-2000.The Brewers were MLB's top team in the regular season with 97 wins, and they knocked out the Chicago Cubs in the NLDS.

    "body": "\n        PHILADELPHIA -- Desperate times call for desperate measures. The Philadelphia Eagles have talked with Brandon Graham about a possible return, seven months after the 37-year-old, two-time Super Bowl champion retired from the league. Graham has been in discussions with the Eagles about coming back to help a pass rush that is in dire need of help, as the Eagles ranked 39th in the NFL in sack percentage (4.3%) and 26th in sacks (11.0). The edge rushers have combined for 3.5 sacks through seven games, with Za'Darius Smith the leader in the clubhouse with 1.5 sacks. Smith retired from the NFL last week after only playing five games with the Eagles, and he wasn't on the roster Week 1. Josh Uche and Patrick Johnson are the only other Eagles edge rushers with sacks (1.0 each), showcasing how depleted the position is. To make matters worse, the Eagles have plenty of injuries at edge rusher. Nolan Smith and Ogbo Okoronkwo are on injured reserve with triceps injuries with Okoronkwo ruled out for the season. Azeez Ojulari also left Sunday's win over the Minnesota Vikings with a hamstring injury.For those counting at home, the Eagles have just three healthy edge rushers on the roster: Uche, Johnson and Jalyx Hunt. They need Graham back just for depth, even if he's not the answer to a bigger problem. \nWhat can Graham actually provide for Eagles? In short, who knows? Graham played through a torn triceps injury in Super Bowl LIX, the same injury he suffered in November of what was his final season. Graham won't be judged on his performance on the field, but what he brings to the locker room in veteran experience.The Eagles had that with Za'Darius Smith prior to his sudden retirement, as Smith actually occupied Graham's locker. With that locker vacant, Graham will fill the role as veteran mentor and leader. \"His locker will be ready,\" said Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts to reporters following his press conference after Sunday's win over the Vikings. \nThe Eagles just need bodies at edge rusher at this stage of the season until Nolan Smith returns, which is expected to be sometime after the bye week (Week 9). They're depleted at the position, so Graham returning and taking snaps on Sunday against the New York Giants would be a net positive. Graham coming out of retirement after a Super Bowl championship where he could walk into the sunset is unorthodox, but not unprecedented. The Eagles could use another player on the edge just to help out what they currently have on the active roster.Adding Graham doesn't mean the Eagles are done at edge rusher. Far from it. Who can Eagles target at edge rusher?There are certainly some edge rushers who will be available at the trade deadline, and the Eagles have plenty of premium draft capital to acquire one. The Eagles have 10 draft picks available in the 2026 NFL Draft.\nEagles draft picks -- 2026RoundAcquired1Own2Own3Own3From Jets3Projected compensatory4Own4Projected compensatory5Conditional (from 49ers)5Projected compensatory6From VikingsThe Eagles have five picks in the first three rounds and seven in the first four rounds, allowing them to afford parting ways with a pick or two to get a premium edge rusher. While the Eagles would prefer to keep their picks for future assets, the point of having premium draft picks is to make a Super Bowl contending roster better at the trade deadline.This is what the Eagles have to do if they wish to repeat as Super Bowl champions, as the pass rush played a major part in winning Super Bowl LIX. What the Eagles currently have at edge rusher isn't cutting it, so here are some candidates who could fill a void. Trey Hendrickson (Cincinnati Bengals)Hendrickson is the premier edge rusher available, and the Bengals are not out of the AFC North race as of yet. Cincinnati may not actually trade Hendrickson unless they get an offer they can't pass up. Hendrickson has a 14.5% pressure rate with 4.0 sacks on the season, and he's coming off consecutive 17.0-sack seasons. Adding Hendrickson would arguably place the Eagles as the best team in the NFC, even with their struggles on both sides of the ball. Jaelan Phillips (Miami Dolphins)The Dolphins are in a free fall as they have already had conversations about Mike McDaniel's future. They will be sellers at the deadline, and have a few players available. Phillips is in the fifth-year option of his rookie deal, so he'll be a free agent after the season. Phillips has a 16.7% pressure rate this season with 2.0 sacks and 22 pressures. He would be bolstered depth for an Eagles pass rush that needs good players. Phillips has also played one season under Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, having 27 pressures, 6.5 sacks, and a 13.6% pressure rate in eight games in 2023. Bradley Chubb (Miami Dolphins)Another Dolphins player available at the deadline, the 29-year-old Chubb has an 11.5% pressure rate with 4.0 sacks and 15 pressures in seven games. A young pass rush (even with the addition of Graham), could use a veteran like Chubb -- who had 11.0 sacks, 70 pressures, and a 15.7% pressure rate in his year with Fangio. Chubb has two years and $61.7 million in cap money left on his deal, so acquiring him would be difficult. He still would benefit going back in Fangio's scheme, as he also played for the Eagles defensive coordinator with the Denver Broncos. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Betting on parlays involves combining multiple sports bets into a single wager. We'll take a look at how parlay betting works for sports betting, how parlay odds are determined and parlay betting strategies. You can also start betting parlays right now at DraftKings Sportsbook:What is a parlay bet?A parlay bet is when a user combines multiple wagers into a single bet slip. This means the user is counting on multiple outcomes being correct to cash the bet, as opposed to betting on each outcome individually. Because of this, the odds are higher than individual bets at sports betting sites. However, users are less likely to cash parlay bets, as even one incorrect outcome causes the entire bet to lose.How parlay odds workParlay odds are calculated by taking the odds of each individual wager and combining them. Sportsbooks have their own algorithms for calculating parlay odds, but typically you can multiply the odds of each leg in parlay to get the payout. For example, if you're parlaying three point spread picks at -110 odds, the total comes out to 6.86. That would be +586 when removing the stake.You can combine many types of individual bets into a single parlay. For example, you can pick the point spread of one game, the total of another and the money line result of a third contest and put all those wagers into one bet slip as a parlay. However, if even one outcome is incorrect, your entire bet loses.Understanding parlays and parlay rulesParlay betting varies by sport and there are restrictions on what you can include. For example, some sportsbooks and sportsbook promos will not let you bet the point spread and money line on the same favorite in a parlay. You can make those wagers individually, but not in a parlay for increased odds.Some platforms now have same-game parlays (SGPs), where the odds might be adjusted slightly for multiple bets on the same contest.For example, the Philadelphia Eagles were 7-point favorites in Week 1 of the NFL season against the Dallas Cowboys at DraftKings Sportsbook. The total was 46.5. Bettors could parlay a pick on the spread and a pick on the total, or a pick on the money line and a pick on the total. If you wanted to add more legs, you could have added player props and/or game props.Parlaying player prop bets is especially popular in NBA betting. Same-game parlays are common in basketball too, but you can combine player props from different games in the same bet slip. For example, a user can bet on LeBron James to go Over his points line and Kevin Durant to go Under his rebounds line as a parlay. If James and Durant were playing in the same game, the sportsbook would present the combined wager as an SGP. Now that you know the rules, sign up for FanDuel Sportsbook:Sports where parlay betting might not be availableThere are some events, like a golf tournament or F1 race, where only one competitor wins. Users wouldn't be able to parlay multiple competitors winning, as one outcome would automatically eliminate the other outcome on the bet slip.However, sportsbooks do offer markets like \"top 10 finish\" or \"top 5 finish\" for these events, where users can parlay selections as long as they do not conflict with each other. For example, a user can parlay Lando Norris to win the Las Vegas Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton to finish in the top 5, and Oscar Piastri to finish in the top 5.Other types of parlaysWe've gone over the traditional parlay, which combines two or more bets into one bet slip, and the same-game parlay, which combines two or more outcomes from the same contest into one bet slip. However, there are other types of parlays that sportsbooks offer.SGP+, SGPx and Super ParlaysSGP+ or SGPx bets combine same-game parlay outcomes, but from different games. Every sportsbook has a different name for this same concept. For example, the Eagles faced the Cowboys in Week 1 and the Green Bay Packers played the Detroit Lions. If a user bet on Saquon Barkley, CeeDee Lamb, Josh Jacobs and Jahmyr Gibbs to all score touchdowns, those legs could be reflected as two same-game parlays within one bet slip as a SGP+ or SGPx.TeasersIn parlay betting, a teaser is when a bettor adjusts the line on one wager to gain more value, but in turn has to add another leg in order to place the bet. This is less common now with sportsbooks offering substantial alternate lines on point spreads and totals.For example, let's say the Eagles were 7.5-point favorites in Week 1 against the Cowboys and the total was 46.5. If you don't like that line and want to bet Eagles -2.5. Traditionally, the sportsbook will give you five points if you also take a position on the total.However, as mentioned earlier, platforms now offer alternate spreads and totals at different odds, so teasing into a parlay isn't necessarily required.Round Robin ParlaysRound Robin parlay betting is also offered at many sportsbooks and requires at least three picks. For example, let's say you are putting the Eagles money line, Chiefs money line and Commanders money line in a parlay for Week 1. You can use the Round Robin function to place multiple bets with the same picks.This Round Robin functions as three separate two-leg parlays. You will get paid out winnings if any of them wins, but you may not make a profit if only one wins. Understand and double-check how many of the wagers within a Round Robin you need to hit to make a profit before placing the bet.Best sportsbooks to bet parlaysAll the top sportsbooks offer parlay betting, with the biggest difference being odds and promotions. DraftKings and FanDuel Sportsbook typically offer profit boosts on SGP bets for big events, though there are requirements for the number of legs and minimum odds. There's always value in looking at multiple sportsbooks to find the best odds for the parlay you are trying to create, as even a slight change in odds can have a compounded impact in a parlay setting. Check out the latest betting odds at Bet365 Sportsbook and use the promo code CBSBET365 to sign up:Tips and advice for parlay bettingWhile parlay betting is fun and it can be exciting to follow, it's generally not advised as a long-term strategy for profitability. While you may see sportsbooks promote massive parlay payouts where users bet minimal amounts and end up winning big, the majority of parlay bets lose.If you do wish to bet parlays, understand that fewer legs can increase your chances of winning. You should also consider reducing the amount you wager on parlays because of the additional risk.Sportsbooks also curtail the odds slightly on parlays when considering the true probability of a parlay wager hitting and the associated odds, making it tougher to be profitable by consistently betting parlays.Parlay odds calculator and converterHere's a table showing true implied probability, the corresponding true odds and the implied probability associated with the odds provided by the sportsbook (paid implied probability and paid odds). All legs are considered -110 for the purpose of this table.Parlay SizeTrue Implied ProbabilityTrue OddsPaid Implied ProbabilityPaid Odds150%+10052.4%-110225%+30027.4%+264.5312.5%+70014.4%+595.846.2%+15007.5%+1228.353.1%+31003.9%+2435.961.6%+63002.1%+474170.8%+127001.1%+9142.480.4%+255000.6%+1754490.2%+511000.3%+33585100.1%+1023000.2%+64208The difference between paid odds and true odds grows as you add more legs. Therefore, if you're considering parlay betting, keeping your bet slip to four legs or fewer.FAQWhat does parlay mean?A parlay is any wager where there are two or more bets involved.What is an example of a parlay?Betting the Eagles money line, Chiefs money line and Commanders money line all in one wager is an example of a parlay. If a user makes the three bets separately, it would not be considered a parlay as the outcome of one game does not impact the other bets as it would in a parlay.How do you play parlays?Parlay betting varies from sportsbook to sportsbook, but most platforms offer the same types of parlays. These are traditional, same-game, SGP+ and SGPx, teasers and Round Robins.Is the parlay a risky bet?Parlay betting is generally not advised since there is a lower chance of winning as you add more legs and the payouts are not in line with the true implied probability of winning. While all bets carry some risk of losing, parlay betting compounds that risk since it only takes one incorrect outcome to wipe out the entire bet slip.Where can I place parlay bets?You can place parlay bets at most sportsbooks, though some will have restrictions on which legs can be included.What happens to my parlay if a leg pushes?If a leg in a parlay is pushed or voided, sportsbooks generally will not count that leg and adjust the odds of the parlay accordingly. If the other legs in the parlay are correct, sportsbooks will typically pay out the adjusted odds for those remaining legs. However, the policy on pushed and voided legs in parlays can vary across sportsbooks, so if you're looking for specific guidance, you should check the guidelines and rules of that particular platform.\n            ",

Miami lost to the Cleveland Browns, 31-6, while Mike McDaniel's offense gained just 219 total yards and lost the turnover battle, 4-0. Three of those four turnovers came via quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who threw the ball to the wrong team three different times in rainy Cleveland. Overall, Tagovailoa completed 12 of 23 passes for just 100 yards.When a reporter asked McDaniel if Tagovailoa was going to be his starting quarterback for the Week 8 showdown against the Atlanta Falcons, he answered in the affirmative. But also used some comedic exaggeration at his signal-caller's expense. \"He's gonna take the snaps this week and he's gonna be our starter this week and my expectation is that we don't throw 10 picks,\" McDaniel said. \nTagovailoa became the first quarterback to throw three interceptions in two straight games since Philip Rivers in 2019, according to CBS Sports Research. His 10 interceptions are tied with Geno Smith for most in the NFL. Tagovailoa threw just seven interceptions in 11 games played last year.\nJokes aside, it appears the clock is getting close to striking midnight for McDaniel. Despite the embarrassing loss, NFL Media reports that no changes are expected at this time. McDaniel has gone 29-29 in his four seasons with Miami, which includes a 3-15 record vs. winning teams compared to a 26-14 record vs. teams .500 or below. \n            \n    ",

The Pacers released a brief statement acknowledging the situation, per Fox 59, but did not have additional comment while they gathered more information. \nJones was the 38th overall pick by the Pacers in the second round of the 2025 NBA Draft out of Marquette and signed a four-year deal worth $8.6 million that is only partially guaranteed in Year 2, non-guaranteed for Year 3 and has a team option in Year 4. Jones is currently dealing with a back injury and was already expected to miss the start of the season, but will now await his hearing and resolution of his two pending charges. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        What are we supposed to make of the 2025-26 New Orleans Pelicans? It's encouraging that Zion Williamson is feeling better physically than he has since college, but he's going to have a lot on his shoulders. Approaching opening night, two would-be starters -- Dejounte Murray and Kevon Looney -- are on the shelf, as is rookie big man Derik Queen. If the season goes sideways again, they can't chase lottery balls this time. Their new front office, led by Joe Dumars and Troy Weaver, wanted Queen so badly that they made a reckless trade on draft night, surrendering their unprotected 2026 pick (and the right to swap it for the Milwaukee Bucks' pick).Despite all of this, the Pelicans should at least be interesting. There's no one in the league quite like a healthy Williamson, and he'll initiate a lot of their offense. Trey Murphy III gets better every year, Herb Jones is a demon on defense and Jose Alvarado plays every possession at maximum intensity. Jordan Poole, acquired from the Washington Wizards for CJ McCollum, quietly had a bounceback season in 2024-25. Jeremiah Fears, drafted six spots before Queen, is tough to keep out of the paint. I have questions about New Orleans' depth, though, and about the spacing and the rim protection and the overall direction of the team. If you can figure out what the bigger-picture plan is, please let me know.The State of PlayLast year: The Pelicans' 21-61 record was the worst in franchise history. Their offense ranked 25th, their defense 29th. Only the Wizards had a worse point differential. Injuries had derailed this team before, but never like this. Rookie center Yves Missi led the team in minutes (1,956), and guard Jordan Hawkins (1,321), big man Jeremiah Robinson-Earl (1,239) and wing Javonte Green (1,092) ranked fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. Murray, New Orleans' big offseason acquisition, hurt his hand on opening night and tore his Achilles in late January but still managed to play in more games (31) than Williamson (30), Jones (20) and Brandon Ingram (18). At the trade deadline, the Pelicans sent Ingram to Toronto for Bruce Brown, Kelly Olynyk, a 2026 first-round pick and a 2031 second-round pick.The offseason: New Orleans fired lead executive David Griffin as soon as the season ended and replaced him with Joe Dumars about four seconds later. During the NBA Finals, the Pelicans acquired the No. 23 pick in the 2025 draft and the rights to Mojave King from Indiana in exchange for the Pacers' own 2026 pick, which had landed in New Orleans as part of the Ingram deal. In Game 7 of the Finals, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles, immediately increasing the value of the pick that New Orleans had sent their way. On draft night, the Pelicans selected Fears with the No. 7 pick and then made the second-most ridiculed trade of 2025, throwing away an extremely valuable 2026 first so they could move up from No. 23 to No. 13 and select Queen. They also traded McCollum, Olynyk, the rights to King and a 2027 second-round pick to Washington for Poole, Saddiq Bey and the No. 40 pick, which they used to select wing Micah Peavy. In free agency, they signed Looney away from the Warriors on a two-year, $16 million deal with a team option. They also signed Jones to a three-year, $67.6 million contract extension with a player option. Brown signed with Denver for the minimum, Green signed with Detroit for the minimum and Robinson-Earl signed a training camp deal with Dallas but didn't make the final roster. \nLas Vegas over/under: 31.5 wins, per FanDuel SportsbookThe ConversationPelicans believer: Last season was a drag, but the Pelicans have turned the page. I love that Zion Williamson is dialed in and Trey Murphy III is aiming to be an All-Star. I know the new front office took a lot of heat in the offseason, but, if you can look past what they gave up to get Derik Queen, there's stuff to like here. Kevon Looney will help them on the boards, set solid screens and set an example with his selfless play. Jordan Poole is eight years younger than CJ McCollum. You may have forgotten about Saddiq Bey because he missed all of last season, but he's a solid pickup. Both Queen and Jeremiah Fears are crafty prospects with star potential. Don't write this team off, and don't forget that Dejounte Murray has been dunking since August. I'm not sure when exactly he'll be back, but I'm expecting him to give the team a boost at some point.Pelicans skeptic: I don't even know where to begin with the Pelicans. Outside of Sacramento, no team in the NBA confuses me like they do. How am I supposed to look past what they did on draft night? Even if I put the value proposition of the Queen trade to the side, their decisions don't have internal consistency. Is this a win-now team? If so, then why did it draft a 19-year-old and a 20-year-old who have glaring deficiencies on defense? Is the new front office trying to rebuild on the fly? If so, then why did it give up its first-round pick with no protections whatsoever? Queen has upside as a playmaking 5, but he seems like a horrendous fit with Williamson on both ends. Why did Joe Dumars and Troy Weaver decide that they'd rather pay Poole $31.8 million in 2026-27 than keep McCollum around? Do you expect me to praise them for using the majority of the MLE on Looney? Do you really think that Murray, coming of a torn Achilles, is just going to fit right in? I could go on, but I'm genuinely curious how anybody could be optimistic about this organization right now.Pelicans believer: No, go on. Please. Get it out of your system.Pelicans skeptic: I just don't understand what they're doing! Big picture, move by move, any way you want to look at it, the Pelicans are mystifying. Why did the new front office not hire a new coaching staff? Why didn't they at least let James Borrego go to New York? Why does the team that employs Williamson have no stretch bigs? Why did they pick up Jordan Hawkins' $7 million fourth-year option? Why, after effectively dumping Brandon Ingram for financial reasons, have they gotten themselves so close to the 2026-27 luxury-tax line? You can't make this stuff make sense.\nPelicans believer: Are you done? Do you have anything nice to say about the Pelicans?Pelicans skeptic: Sure. Jose Alvarado is one of the best reserves in the NBA, and I love watching him annoy everyone he plays against. Jones and Murphy should remain core parts of this team for a long time, and they're both on great contracts. I love how Yves Missi tries to dunk everything. I'm pleased that Williamson appears to be healthy. The Pelicans' broadcast is one of the best in the business. Is that enough for you?Pelicans believer: That's a start. I'd add that, if they have better injury luck than they've had recently, they have the talent to be pretty good! A lot has changed since then, but I keep thinking about how the Pelicans were playing in the second half of the 2023-24 season, before Ingram and Alvarado got hurt in March and Williamson got hurt late in their play-in game against the Lakers. Williamson was playing the best all-around basketball of his life, and that injury cut short one of the best performances of his career. I remember him getting more comfortable with his jump shot and exerting tons of energy on defense, even late in games, and that's the main reason I'm optimistic. The other reason is that Murphy, Jones and Alvarado are still in New Orleans. If nothing else, I know those guys work well together.\nPelicans skeptic: Do you? This will be that foursome's \"fifth\" season together, but they've only actually shared the floor for a total of 145 minutes in 27 games, all of which came in 2022-23 and 2023-24. The Pelicans played well in those minutes, and I hope they're all healthy at the same time more often this year. I hope Williamson sustains the level of play that you're referencing, too. I advise you to expect the worst, though, and to remember how weird the rest of this roster is.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One day after Florida decided to fire football coach Billy Napier, athletic director Scott Stricklin and star quarterback DJ Lagway took the podium to discuss the news. Stricklin addressed his decision to move on from Napier and the upcoming coaching search, and Lagway spoke on his future with the Gators.Napier, hired by Stricklin in November 2021, was never able to get the Gators off the ground in his tenure. His best season as an 8-5 mark in 2024, and Napier was off to a 3-4 start this season. Heading into the bye week, Stricklin chose to fire Napier following Saturday's win over Mississippi State.Now, Stricklin is preparing to make his third football coaching hire since arriving at Florida in 2016. His first two hires, Dan Mullen and Napier, didn't achieve the heights expected of them, so the pressure will be on Stricklin to find a coach who can lead the Gators back to the top of the SEC.\n        \n            \n                Florida coaching search odds: Lane Kiffin, Urban Meyer among 10 candidates to replace Billy Napier\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen Stricklin spoke to reporters Monday, he answered questions about what factors played a role in Napier's firing, as well as how Florida would approach its search for the next coach.\nWhy things didn't work out with NapierStricklin said that, while he had a lot of \"faith\" and \"confidence\" in Napier, coaching hires are an \"inexact science.\" The Florida AD noted that Napier did some good things in Gainesville, but it wasn't up to the championship standard that had been set before him.One of the biggest sources of frustration around Napier's tenure at Florida was an offense that could never seem to get out of neutral. Throughout his time with the Gators, Napier insisted on calling plays, but the results never really improved. In fact, Florida's best season in terms of scoring was in 2022, Napier's first season. That year, the Gators scored 29.5 points per game, good for 57th in the nation.Stricklin admitted he and Napier discussed those offensive woes, and he even suggested Napier may be better off in more of a CEO role.\n\"We had a lot of conversations related to that,\" Stricklin said. \"We spent, probably, hours in conversation. I shared with him that his strength may be leading the program and overseeing the bigger picture.\"At the end of the day, my philosophy is you hire head coaches. You give them the authority to make decisions on how they want to run their program, and then you hold them accountable to that. That's probably a big reason we're here today.\"When Napier was facing an uncertain future after the 2024 season, Stricklin brought him back. As for whether Napier hiring a play caller for his staff was a prerequisite for him keeping his job into 2025, Stricklin said discussions were had but that it was never \"this, or else.\"\nGiven the opportunity to clarify that Stricklin himself -- and not the boosters -- made the final call on Napier, Stricklin said the power brokers at Florida take a hands-off approach with the AD.\"I have a lot of encouragement,\" Stricklin said. \"I have a lot of support, but I don't have anybody reaching over and trying to grab the steering wheel. I think that's one of the things that makes this place really unique, and it's one the reasons why we've had this much success.Looking ahead to the coaching searchAs Stricklin turns his attention to the coaching search, he expects to have a \"wide variety\" of candidates from \"a lot of different backgrounds.\" Stricklin said finding a proven championship-caliber coach is hard these days, so the Gators will likely have to find someone with the potential to hit that ceiling.\n\"It is tricky,\" Stricklin said. \"There are three current coaches in college football who have won national championships. Unless one of those three decide they want to come -- and we think they're a good fit -- we're gonna have to make a projection somewhere along the line.\"Stricklin also made the case that firing Napier earlier in the season gives the Gators an advantage because \"time is an asset\" with these searches.\"The unique thing about these high-profile positions is … the time to make those searches is compressed,\" Stricklin said. \"Usually, you have a week or two, and there's some kind of impending date you wanna get it to because there's some kind of portal opening up or signing day occurring. We have a little bit more time in this circumstance. … We have a chance to be very thorough.\"\nFlorida is one of the first programs to enter a coaching market expected to be red hot by season's end. Penn State has already made its move, and more high-profile programs may follow in the coming weeks. Asked what will help the Gators stand out in a crowded room, Stricklin made his pitch.\"I think that logo stands out,\" Stricklin said. \"The Gator head is pretty special. In a state of 22 million, the third-largest state in the country. Over 500,000 living alumni. Top-five public university. We've had, what, 14 or 15 straight sellouts. … The results on the field haven't been what we're accustomed to. Yet, Gator nation keeps coming and supporting at such a high level.\"The facilities. The access to talent. Young people want to be at the University of Florida. This is a place people are drawn to. Every coach that we have on this campus will tell you kids will answer the phone when they see it's from the Gators. We have a lot of advantages that we need to utilize.\"\nFinally, when asked to clarify that he is solely responsible for hiring the next coach, Stricklin gave a short and clear answer.\"I am, yes.\"DJ Lagway addresses his future at FloridaFlorida quarterback DJ Lagway and his family were, and are, close with Napier. Lagway was one of the biggest recruiting wins of Napier's tenure, as he signed with the Gators as the No. 1 quarterback and the No. 3 prospect nationally in the 2024 class.He's been Napier's starter since former transfer addition Graham Mertz went down with an ACL tear six games into the 2024 season. Lagway stuck around through the lows of the Napier era, but there is justifiable concern that the Gators could lose him to the transfer portal in the offseason.\nThough Lagway admitted that Napier's firing was \"hard,\" and that Sunday was \"very emotional,\" he did reaffirm his commitment to the team as it finishes 2025 out.\"I'm a Florida Gator,\" Lagway said when asked about his prospects beyond the season. \"My biggest focus right now is these five games and continuing to better my craft and continuing to develop as a player.\"The 6-foot-3 and 247-pound Lagway has thrown for 1,513 yards with nine touchdowns to nine interceptions this season. He's completed under 60% of his passes in three of Florida's last five games.\nLagway could benefit from the fact that quarterbacks coach Ryan O'Hara will call plays on gameday as part of interim coach Billy Gonzales' staff. Lagway will also continue to work with Russ Callaway in his role as offensive coordinator.\"Coach O'Hara, he's been there from the beginning,\" Lagway said. \"He's taught me a lot, even when I was in high school having meetings with him during the recruiting process and him helping me with different things. I have a great relationship with coach O'Hara and I'm excited for it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Lakers trading for Russell Westbrook in the summer of 2021 served as a multiyear setback to the franchise's hopes of winning a second title with LeBron James. Westbrook arrived with the Lakers hoping to form a Big 3 with LeBron and Anthony Davis, and apparently was the choice of James to fill the point guard spot in Los Angeles. However, it didn't take long for it to be clear that on-court marriage was going to fail, and the relationship between James and Westbrook deteriorated quickly. After a disastrous 2021-22 season, the Lakers were determined to try and run it back in 2022-23, but Westbrook and James were at odds and a new anecdote from Yaron Weitzman's upcoming book \"A Hollywood Ending: The Dreams and Drama of the LeBron Lakers\" published in The Ringer details how bad things got. According to Weitzman, the two were barely on speaking terms coming into the '22-23 season after the rumors James wanted the Lakers to trade Russ for Kyrie Irving, and Westbrook's frustration with how James went about his business in L.A. came to a head in the strangest of times -- a Will Smith speaking appearance at Lakers practice.\nThe full story is worth reading here, but effectively, Westbrook took serious issue with what he felt was James acting fake once Smith arrived.That's because prior to Smith coming to speak to the team, James and Davis left and Westbrook asked if the rest of the team could leave too. He was informed by Patrick Beverley that wasn't the case and that LeBron and AD got preferential treatment. That led to an argument and eventually coach Darvin Ham brought James and Davis back in and then Smith was brought in to speak. When they all returned, Smith was greeted with smiles and daps. Smith talked to the players about his new movie, Emancipation. He talked about overcoming adversity. He cracked some jokes at the team's expense. Then he opened the floor for questions.LeBron was first. He had a question, he said. Smith answered. Then LeBron had another question. And another after that and another after that and another after that. On and on he went, stretching what was supposed to be a 30-minute session into nearly an hour.\"The same guy who was trying to leave is now quoting back movie lines and going through the guy's whole life story,\" one attendee recalled thinking. Seated in the third row, picking at a bowl of fruit, Westbrook watched in disbelief, shaking his head and rolling his eyes every time LeBron spoke.I hate that fake shit, Westbrook said to a teammate afterward, as the Lakers gathered for a team photo. I just can't do it.It's a tremendous story and points to the dysfunction and frustration that defined that Lakers team. Westbrook's tenure in L.A. was short, but that year and a half was a drama-filled disaster in which all parties involved shared responsibility for their collective failure. \n        \n            \n                Lakers' Jaxson Hayes seeks Slovenian passport to join Luka Dončić in international competition\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Lakers traded two key contributors from their 2020 title team, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and a first round pick to Washington for Westbrook. Those players and picks were among their best trade chips, and it took until last season for L.A. to have the ammunition and willfulness to pull the trigger on another big move -- a much better trade to bring in Luka Dončić. Westbrook, for his part, was not good on the court. His second season in L.A. prior to being traded to the Jazz was the least efficient shooting season since his rookie year, and his two seasons with the Lakers were two of the only four seasons of his career (along with his rookie year and 2024-25 in Denver) that he produced negative offensive win shares. Those struggles weren't hard to see coming, though, as Westbrook profiled as a poor fit with LeBron and AD given he was never a good perimeter shooter, yet the Lakers ignored those red flags to bring him in anyways without a clear plan on how to maximize the skillset he does have. LeBron shares culpability as well for stumping for Westbrook in the initial trade despite the questionable fit.All told, the Westbrook era set the Lakers back a few years and perhaps burned their chance to build around James and Davis. They've pivoted well to the Luka Dončić era, but that's created its own bit of drama with James, who is no longer the star being catered to at every move. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the first of two \"Monday Night Football\" games, the Detroit Lions play host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Detroit is coming off a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday night that snapped a four-game winning streak. The Lions enter this game at 4-2 now, and need to get back in the win column to compete in the races for the NFC North and seeding in the NFC playoffs in general.Tampa won by a somewhat comfortable margin for the first time all year last week, defeating the 49ers by multiple scores. The Buccaneers are 5-1 and looking like one of the best teams in the NFC, but they've had to pull off a high-wire act to get to where they are. They've got a lead in the NFC South, but could drop back to the pack if they don't pick up a victory here.Will the Buccaneers continue to roll, or will the Lions get back in the win column? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Buccaneers liveDate: Monday, Oct. 20 | Time: 7:00 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -6, O/U 53.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet Lions vs. Buccaneers and other NFL games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.When the Buccaneers have the ball\nBaker Mayfield is playing at an extraordinarily high level this season. He's completed 66.2% of his passes at an average of 7.9 yards per attempt, with 12 touchdowns and just one interception. He's done this despite playing without Chris Godwin for all but two games, without Mike Evans for three and without Emeka Egbuka for much of last week's win over the 49ers. He's also done it despite the Bucs shuffling their offensive line all year long. Evans is expected to return for this game, while Egbuka is considered a game-time decision despite suffering a hamstring strain last week. Evans' return is an especially welcome one for a game where the Lions will be without multiple defensive backs. Brian Branch was suspended for smacking JuJu Smith-Schuster last week, while Terrion Arnold, Avonte Maddox and Kerby Joseph are all out with injuries. \nThe only starting Lions defensive back who will be active for this game is Amik Robertson, and he'll likely be playing out of position on the perimeter due to the other injuries. There should be chances for Evans to get open against the backup DBs, and for Egbuka to get going as well, if he plays. Detroit is 14th in EPA per dropback allowed to opponents, via Tru Media, but will be without 80% of the starting defensive backfield.The best way to make up for the injuries on the back end is obviously to generate consistent pressure. The Lions have gotten to quarterbacks at just about an exactly league-average rate so far this season, while the Bucs have also allowed pressure at an average rate. The Lions have to be very careful about their rush lane integrity in this one, as Mayfield has been fantastic at escaping the rush and scrambling for first downs. Mayfield has 17 scrambles so far this year and is averaging 9.5 yards a pop, per Tru Media.\nIn the run game, it will again be Rachaad White filling in for Bucky Irving, who remains out with multiple injuries. White hasn't been particularly efficient running the ball this year, averaging 4.0 yards per carry and just 3.4 per carry in his two starts. Detroit is 10th in yards allowed per carry this season, and has done an excellent job at limiting yards after contact (2.29 per rush compared with a league average of 3.00). White could find tough sledding here, putting some pressure on Mayfield and the passing game to carry the offense. That's how the Bucs operate anyway, though, so they'll likely be comfortable in a situation such as that.\nWhen the Lions have the ballDetroit's offense has looked world-beating in four of its six games and rather ordinary in the other two. In Weeks 2 through 5, the Lions averaged 394.8 yards and 40.3 points per game, scoring 34 or more in each contest. In Weeks 1 and 6, though, they averaged 271.5 yards per game and scored just 30 points total. The difference in the two poor games, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that they went down by multiple scores and had to rely on the straight dropback passing game rather than being able to mix run, pass and play action. \nIn Weeks 2 through 5, Jared Goff's \"true\" dropback rate, according to Tru Media, was just 53.6%, which means that the Lions were running screens, play action or RPOs on more than 46% of their dropbacks. In Weeks 1 and 6, though, the true dropback rate spiked to 64.9%, indicating that they were only able to get to screens, play action or RPOs around 35% of the time. That's equivalent to the difference between being exactly league average in true dropback rate and ranking second-to-last. The Lions want to live toward the lower end of the spectrum in that stat so that they can access the full breadth of their offense.\nHow they choose to attack this Tampa Bay defense will be interesting to watch. The Lions are typically an Establish the Run type of team, but Tampa ranks fifth-best in opponents' rushing success rate allowed, via Tru Media, and just 25th in passing success rate. Opponents have completed 68.3% of their passes at an average of 7.6 yards per attempt, with 10 touchdowns against four interceptions against Tampa so far this year. The Buccaneers have once again blitzed at one of the highest rates in the NFL, sending extra rushers on 35.3% of opponent dropbacks. Goff has torn apart blitzes this season, ranking first in the NFL in EPA per dropback while completing 37 of 48 passes for 495 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. It's notable that last year, the Bucs dialed back their blitz rate considerably in their game against the Lions, sending pressure on just 26.8% of dropbacks. Goff threw for 307 yards in the game, but it took him 55 pass attempts to do so and he threw two interceptions.\nStill, there should be opportunities in the underneath areas of the field for Amon-Ra St. Brown, given that we should expect Tampa to play a heavy dosage of zone defense against a team that tears apart man coverage. The Bucs have also given up an above-average rate of explosive passing plays, per Tru Media, so they'll have to protect against the possibility of a deep ball to Jameson Williams over the top of the coverage.\nPrediction\nTampa is 5-1 so far this season but has been walking a very tight rope. The Bucs' five victories have come by a total of just 20 points, with four of those wins coming by a single score. If the Lions can keep Goff well protected, they should be able to move the ball here. And when they move the ball and therefore don't have to play from multiple scores down, they come away with wins. Pick: Lions 31, Buccaneers 23\n            ",

The future Hall of Famer and his longtime team have broken off talks after several differences arose during their early discussions, reports the New York Post. Pujols was said to be owner Arte Moreno's top choice to manage. It is unlikely the two sides will reconnect later, per The Athletic.The Baltimore Orioles are among the other teams with interest in Pujols. The San Diego Padres are in the mix as well.The Angels have missed the postseason each of the last 11 seasons and they've had a losing record the last 10 seasons. Including interim Ray Montgomery this year, they've had four managers in the last four years and five managers in the last seven years.Pujols, 45, retired following the 2022 season and last year won a championship with Leones del Escogido of the Dominican Winter League in his managerial debut.

He is an 11-time All-Star who won three MVPs, two Gold Gloves, six Silver Sluggers, and two World Series titles. Pujols, who spent nine full seasons with the Angels, will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2028.The Angels, Orioles, and Padres are three of eight teams currently without a manager, joining the Atlanta Braves, Colorado Rockies, Minnesota Twins, San Francisco Giants, and Washington Nationals. \nThe Giants are said to be close to hiring University of Tennessee head coach Tony Vitello for their managerial job.\n            \n    ",

Whether he misses time remains to be seen.Coach Dave Canales described Bryce Young as \"day-to-day\" with an ankle injury when speaking with reporters on Monday. \"I saw him this morning, talked to him and he's like, 'Let's push this thing. Let's see what we got.' So we're going to try to take that approach with it and just go from there,\" Canales said. However, NFL Media reported that an MRI revealed Young suffered a high ankle sprain, and that he is expected to miss at the very least the Week 8 matchup against the Buffalo Bills. \nYoung completed 15 of 25 passes for 138 yards and one touchdown on Sunday before exiting the contest. Veteran Andy Dalton, who completed 4 of 7 passes for 60 yards, replaced him. Dalton projects to start in place of Young this week. The \"Red Rifle\" is in his third season with Carolina and he started six games, winning just one of them. In 12 total games played with the Panthers, the 37-year-old Dalton has thrown for 1,468 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions.This is a tough break for Young, who is coming off what was just his second career win on the road. So far this season, the former No. 1 overall pick has completed 61.6% of his passes for 1,288 yards, 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. Young's four victories this season match the amount of wins he had in 2024. \nThe Panthers are above .500 for the first time since 2021, but it will reportedly be up to Darnold to keep the winning streak alive. \n            \n    ",

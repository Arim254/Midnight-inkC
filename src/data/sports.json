James Madison, the Sun Belt champion, got a spot in the CFP bracket thanks in large part to Duke upsetting Virginia in the ACC title game, making JMU one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Oregon had a strong 11-1 campaign, but didn't hold a tiebreaker to get into the Big Ten title game. The winner advances to face No. 4 Texas Tech in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. Kickoff from Autzen Stadium is set for 7:30 p.m. ET.

Oregon is the largest favorite to this point in any bowl or playoff game, and that's because the Ducks own a huge talent edge across the board and will be playing on their home field. Quarterback Dante Moore is a possible top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft as he comes into this matchup with 2,733 passing yards, 24 touchdown passes and just six interceptions on the season. Dan Lanning's squad also ranked third in the Big Ten in scoring defense (14.8 points per game) and will present a challenge that James Madison isn't accustomed to.

The Dukes are built to run the ball, leading the Sun Belt with 245.7 yards per game on the ground. Running back Wayne Knight led the way with 1,263 rushing yards, while quarterback Alonza Barnett III had 544 yards and 14 scores on the ground.

Bruce Marshall, who is 45-26-2 over his last 73 NFL ATS picks, is backing the Chargers (+1.5) to cover versus the Cowboys on Sunday.\"Dallas should have had more left in the tank for last Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Vikings, and the defense is starting to resemble its poor form from the first half of the season while allowing 39 ppg in consecutive losses to the Lions and Vikes,\" said Marshall. \"As for the Bolts, they're still playing inspired defense while continuing to chase Denver in the AFC West, and Justin Herbert's left wrist has had another week to heal and get him closer to 100%. This is arguably a tougher test for Dallas than others they didn't pass the past two weeks.

R.J. White is +585 on his past 281 NFL picks, and he's backing Jalen Hurts as an anytime TD scorer in the early kick. \"The Eagles finally got back on track against the Raiders, and this is another good matchup for their offense,\" White said. \"The Washington defense has allowed 3+ TDs in every game played stateside since Week 6, and giving up 21 points and 384 yards to the Giants last week represents one of their best outings in that stretch. We're used to seeing Hurts' ATD prop at much shorter odds in this type of matchup, and even if Lane Johnson isn't able to make it back this week, I think he shouldn't be plus odds to score against a defense that gives up loads of points.\" Get more Eagles vs. Commanders picks here and see Packers vs. Bears picks right here. Patriots vs. Ravens 'Sunday Night Football' picks An important AFC matchups unfolds on Sunday night when the Ravens host the Patriots. The Pats (11-2) currently are the No. 2 seed in the AFC, while the Ravens (7-6) would be just outside the field if the playoffs started now. Claudia Bellofatto has nailed four of her past five NFL player prop picks, and she's backing Drake Maye to go Over on his passing yards on 'SNF.'\"He's cashed this in all but two of the last 10 and he's now facing a Ravens defense allowing the 5th most attempts and over 245 yards a game. We should get either a close game or negative game script to help us get over. Last week was only Maye's second game all season dipping 60% or less on completion percentage. He still leads the league in that category as well as being 2nd in yards per attempt. Plus, he's 3-0 straight up and ATS in career primetime games. I like a bounce back for the Pats MVP and possibly the league's, if he can catch back up to Stafford.\" See more Eagles vs. Ravens picks here.Pick Maye to go Over 242.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\n            ",

He's coming off one of his most efficient games of the season, completing 80% of his passes and throwing for three touchdowns against the Raiders. He has another dream matchup on Saturday as the Commanders have given up the third-most Fantasy points to opposing QBs this season. See who else to pick here.You can also bet Hurts to go Over 217.5 total passing yards using the latest  DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nThe optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Bears tight end Colston Loveland at $5,300 on FanDuel and $3,900 on DraftKings. With Cole Kmet (knee/ankle) listed as questionable and Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden III (ankle) both out, there could be a lot of targets coming Loveland's way. After being targeted no more than four times through the first five weeks of the season, the rookie out of Michigan has now been targeted at least five times each of the past four games. He's coming off a 63-yard performance, his second-highest receiving total of the year, last week. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.Bet Loveland to go Over 44.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to build Saturday Week 16 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Saturday.

The 2025 college football season was filled with drama and intense conference championship races, but now it's time to find out who the best in the nation truly is. Indiana's enters this year's playoff as the No. 1 seed on the heels of a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. Despite the loss, however, the Buckeyes did not fall far from the top spot they previously held, as Ryan Day's team came in at No. 2. SEC champion Georgia enters as the third seed, while Big 12 champion Texas Tech rounds out the top of the field as the No. 4 seed. Those teams all earned first-round byes, but we have some tantalizing matchups coming in the first round. The playoff opened Friday with Alabama's comeback win at Oklahoma. Three more first-round games are on tap for Saturday before the playoff advances to the quarterfinals at some of college football's most iconic bowl venues. Quarterfinal winners will move on to the semifinals Jan. 8 and 9, leading up to the College Football Playoff National Championship Monday, Jan. 20, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. 2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3 | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner: Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (9) Alabama: 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner: 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Watt will miss his second consecutive game after undergoing surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung suffered while getting treatment at the team facility. However, Mike Tomlin hasn't shut the door on a Week 17 return for Watt.While Watt wasn't practicing this week, he was back at the team's facility and doing some \"cardio,\" Tomlin told CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson. With Watt back in the facility, the Steelers are \"hopeful\" their star pass rusher will be back on the field next week when they take on the Cleveland Browns.Watt went to Pittsburgh area hospital last Wednesday after he experienced discomfort in his chest after a dry needling treatment session. He is expected to return to the field this season, per NFL Network. The 31-year-old Watt is in the middle of his ninth season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. A seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro, Watt won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2021 after tying the league's single-season record of 22.5 sacks. Watt, who has led the NFL in sacks on three separate occasions, is the Steelers' career leader with 115 sacks. He surpassed brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list this season. \nIn 13 games this season, Watt has seven sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception. With Watt and Nick Herbig (hamstring) out, the Steelers' pass rush will likely lean heavily on veteran Alex Highsmith and rookie Jack Sawyer during Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions. The Steelers are 8-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. Highsmith is tied for second on the team with 6.5 sacks. Sawyer has one sack, an interception, 26 tackles and three pass breakups in 14 games. \n\"He's had some opportunities this year and has made some plays,\" Tomlin recently said of Sawyer. \"Has had a sack. Has had an interception. So, I wouldn't be surprised if he displays that readiness if he gets an expanded role opportunity this week.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The first round of the College Football Playoff presents two rematches of regular-season games, and the second of those contests comes Saturday afternoon when No. 6-seed Ole Miss hosts No. 11-seed Tulane for the second time in three months. The Rebels left no doubt in the September matchup with a 45-10 blowout victory, and considering their head-to-head result and the fact that lopsided games are not entirely uncommon in the CFP, a repeat outcome is well within the realm of possibility.Changes to both coaching staffs throw uncertainty into the equation, though. Lane Kiffin will not be on the sideline for Ole Miss this time around after he took the LSU job, but Jon Sumrall will continue to lead Tulane even after accepting the Florida position. How both teams adapt to the moving parts on their sidelines could play a role in determining the margin or the outright result in this opening-round showdown.This game marks both teams' CFP debuts, so the winning side will earn its first playoff victory. The squad that comes out on top will meet No. 3 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. Notably, Ole Miss' only loss on the year came in a 43-35 defeat at the hands of the Bulldogs.Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as Ole Miss clashes with Tulane on Saturday in the College Football Playoff. \nWhere to watch Ole Miss vs. Tulane liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Vaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, MississippiTV: TNT | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Ole Miss vs. Tulane: Players to watchQB Trinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss: An unforeseen early-season breakout transformed Chambliss from a backup quarterback into one of the nation's most highly regarded signal-callers. The first matchup against Tulane was part of that emergence. Chambliss, who last week finished eighth in Heisman Trophy voting, passed for 307 yards and ran for 112 more in his most productive outing of the season when he saw this Green Wave defense the first time around.RB Kewan Lacy, Ole Miss: It has been a special year for SEC running backs, and Kewan Lacy is in the most elite tier of them after a regular season in which he paced the league in carries (258) and touchdowns (20) and racked up 1,279 yards on the ground. He feasted down the stretch against three of the SEC's less formidable defensive fronts but was a touchdown machine against even the league's best and will be a handful for the Green Wave.\nLB Princewill Umanmielen, Ole Miss: Umanmielen has been as advertised in his first year with the Rebels. It took a change of scenery for him to fully unlock his potential as a former four-star recruit, and his transfer from Nebraska to Ole Miss precipitated the best year of his career, marked by team-high totals in tackles for loss (10.0) and sacks (6.5). Umanmielen seems to be peaking at the right time with 4.5 of those sacks coming in his last five games.QB Jake Retzlaff, Tulane: The Green Wave offense starts and often stops with Retzlaff, the team leader in passing, rushing and total touchdowns. Although he transferred to Tulane late in the offseason, he settled in admirably with his new team and proceeded over the last 13 games to assert himself as one of the nation's most productive dual-threat quarterbacks. His 16 rushing touchdowns are tied for the most of any FBS quarterback, and his 2,862 passing yards rank sixth in Tulane single-season history.DL Santana Hopper, Tulane: Hopper will enter the transfer portal at the end of Tulane's CFP run, but until then, he will make life difficult on the offensive lines tasked with blocking him this postseason. The first-team all-conference defensive lineman is the face of the Green Wave's run defense but also shines as a pass rusher with 4.5 sacks on the year. He is capable of taking over a game and did so earlier in the season with four tackles for loss against Tulsa.\nS Jack Tchienchou, Tulane: Tchienchou was all over the place in the American championship game and spearheaded an impressive defensive effort against a North Texas team that led the nation in scoring. Tulane's leading tackler forced a fumble, recovered a separate fumble and hauled in an interception against the Mean Green.Ole Miss vs. Tulane prediction, pick\nA lot has changed for both teams since Ole Miss routed Tulane in 45-10 fashion on Sept. 22. What remains consistent, though, is the talent gap between one of the SEC's top teams and the American champions. Most of the Rebels' roster and coaching staff remains intact for the time being, and if it replicates the game plan that entirely stymied the Green Wave and rendered Retzlaff so ineffective that he landed on the bench, this contest will not be particularly competitive. Tulane had no answers on either side of the ball in a 35-point loss in the first contest, so even if it improves slightly in the rematch, it figures to have a hard time staying inside the 17.5-point margin. Pick: Ole Miss -17.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- For Alexander Isak, this really might have been the moment where it all went click. Not that the 10 minutes leading up to his goal had particularly suggested that British football's record signing was on the brink of something, but there is nothing to drag a player out of a prolonged funk like a goal. All the more so given that his goal dragged Liverpool ahead in a game that they resolutely failed to impose themselves on, no matter the difficulties of Tottenham.These were the moments that you pay $175 million. They have been altogether too infrequent for Liverpool, 2-1 winners at Tottenham.Cruelly for Isak, however, they might not be much more frequent for some time yet. It was the other click that threatens to define this day. Or perhaps it was a jar, a jam or something even more heavy-duty. Whatever the nature of the damage done to Isak as Micky van de Ven collided with him well after the shot was away, it was enough to rob Liverpool's No. 9 of what might otherwise have been a moment of ecstasy. There was to be no celebration from Isak nor from his teammates. Dark and worried faces soon surrounded the Swede, who squirmed on the floor in agony, one hand covering his eyes as the other clung onto his left knee. He seemed to fear the worst.A stretcher may not have been required, but the worst fears hardly seemed allayed as Isak hobbled along the touchline at agonizing pace, his weight placed on two Liverpool physios. Suddenly, all manner of fears came crashing into view. When might Isak be back to fire life into year one at his new club? Isn't this what any buyer would always have feared from a player whose Newcastle career was pockmarked with runs of seven or eight games on the sidelines? What of the World Cup and, indeed, the qualifiers in March, where Sweden could really do with one of the best strikers in the world? That's what knee injuries do. For all the advances in rehabilitation and recovery, they are still the ones that have you fearing the worst.\nFor Arne Slot, it was much too soon for such doomerism, though he admitted that his gut feeling was not a positive one. \"I don't have any news on him,\" he said. \"If a player scores and gets injured and doesn't come on the pitch and also doesn't try ... That's usually not a good thing. I cannot say anything more than that. That is just gut feeling. Nothing medical.\"I haven't spoken to him about his feeling but it's a nice thing that he scored. A good goal, assisted by Florian Wirtz.\"Slot might be intent on finding the silver lining but the story of this season seems to be that, no matter how much they spend, Liverpool cannot have nice things. Not for the first time this season, a moment of triumph was swept away in an instant. So too departed a flicker of what Slot's team might have been given more time to build the automatisms they so clearly lack.\nIsak's goal had been the moment the rest of the Premier League had feared since Martin Edwards parked the Brink's truck outside St. James' Park and came up with an offer even Saudi Arabia couldn't refuse. One clumsy moment from Cristian Romero -- the first of many -- and the ball was ricocheting off Alexis Mac Allister and into Isak's path. Smart hold-up play with his back to goal and then the No. 9 slipped the ball to Hugo Ekitike, whose first-time pass found Wirtz in stride. That long-awaited first goal contribution betrayed no nerves, a pass played at just the right moment for Isak to bend one low and across Guglielmo Vicario.\"That's what we would like to see happening a lot,\" said Slot. \"Good finish, good pass. Let's not be too negative yet. We don't know. Let's hope he's back with us soon. Difficult to say.\"This may feel like an overhype of an attack that was as much to do with how little else Liverpool offered in an attacking sense. A header from Ekitike 10 minutes after the opener gave them enough of a cushion to hold off a late charge but against 11, 10 or nine men, Liverpool never got going. It was one thing to get outshot five to one by Spurs in the period before Xavi Simons' red card; Tottenham controlled the game rather well early on. The fact that it was 10 to seven in Tottenham's favor from then on speaks as much to Liverpool's inability to exploit possession and territory as it does the late charge brought about by Richarlison's scrappy finish seven minutes from time. \nLiverpool found themselves clinging on against nine men at the death partly because football is a deeply silly sport for how low-scoring it is, somewhat because the decisions of referee John Brooks stoked an indignation in Tottenham that was worth at least one extra man and predominantly because they could not do enough with the ball. This isn't the first time they've found themselves hanging on against 10 men -- against Newcastle, they roared back in more thrilling fashion -- and it seems there is something that Slot is aware of that is making it harder for Liverpool to impose themselves on teams.\"It's always difficult. If I try to explain why it is difficult then people tell me afterwards, 'you say too much to your future opponents.'\"When we had the ball, that was what hurt me the most. In the nine minutes of added time, I think they had 95% of the ball. Every time when we had the ball, we kicked it away or we threw it away. It was unbelievable that we couldn't keep the ball a bit longer.\"\nThat feels like another problem on top of the other one that has dogged Slot for most of this season: that his team are too easily run through by counterattacking opponents. There were flashes of that, a breakaway chance for 10-man Randal Kolo Muani, but until the late drama, this had more of the feel of the Inter game, a match where Liverpool filled the center to throttle some of the drama out of proceedings. The logic to that should be that when indiscipline from the opponents allows them to apply further control, they turn that into shots and goals.Instead, the quasi-diamond of recent games was more of a lump of coal, all rough edges as Mac Allister found himself pushed up alongside Ekitike, Wirtz roaming high and low in pursuit of the ball. For this system to be effective, the fullbacks need to be at the top of their game. Conor Bradley was struggling with his radar before his injury-enforced exit at the interval and too many of Milos Kerkez's crosses crashed into the first Tottenham shirt. The left flank in particular never got going and inverting into more central areas does not seem to be the best use of Kerkez, a flyer down the line who could offer the width this team lacks too often.Such are the problems Liverpool made for themselves with their half-billion dollar overhaul of the champions, one which seems to have left them light on wingers and center backs while overstuffed with players who would be happiest in the space between midfield and the frontline. This might be a squad that needs reorienting but when you have as much talent as Slot can call upon, there is always the prospect of something clicking. Not that, however.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 15 in the NFL was a rough week for many. Not only did we see several stars go down with injuries, such as Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons and Davante Adams, but we also witnessed a couple of notable teams be eliminated from playoff contention, such as the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals.Week 16 features some incredible matchups. The fate of the NFC South is on the line with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Carolina Panthers, the New England Patriots look to rebound from their loss to the Buffalo Bills against Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens, and the Denver Broncos aim to maintain the No. 1 seed in the AFC versus the Jaguars.Which teams should you pick this weekend, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these matchups are as of Thursday morning at DraftKings Sportsbook. \nTampa Bay Buccaneers (-3) at Carolina Panthers\nDajani (Buccaneers -3): You never know what you're going to get with the Panthers. Bryce Young could throw for 400 yards in an upset victory or look completely helpless. The Buccaneers are on a horrific skid, having lost five out of their past six games.However, I'm going to take Tampa Bay here for two reasons: One, I think the Bucs are simply the better team. Carolina has a -3.8 points per game differential this season, which ranks worst in the NFL among teams .500 or better. Plus, this Carolina defense just allowed the New Orleans Saints to rack up 337 yards and struggled to get Tyler Shough and Co. off the field. Two, Baker Mayfield has his full cast of playmakers back with Bucky Irving, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Jalen McMillan. Prediction: Buccaneers 26, Panthers 20Dubin (Buccaneers -3): I'm riding with the Bucs for mostly the same reasons as Dajani. I trust Tampa's offense more with the reintroduction of Baker Mayfield's playmakers. The Panthers can run the ball decently, but nobody really runs it on the Bucs. You have to beat them through the air. And I just don't think Bryce Young is consistent enough for me to bet on that happening. Prediction: Buccaneers 24, Panthers 17\nLos Angeles Chargers at Dallas Cowboys (-1.5)\nDajani (Chargers +1.5): The Cowboys printed money for several weeks, including when they upset the Philadelphia Eagles and Chiefs in the span of five days. Then, they were blown out by the Detroit Lions and upset by J.J. McCarthy and the Vikings. It's tough to gauge where this team is with their backs up against the wall, especially with them facing a stout Chargers team. L.A. is actually allowing just 242.3 total yards per game and 17.3 points per game during this 6-1 stretch. Give me the underdog. Prediction: Chargers 30, Cowboys 24Dubin (Chargers +1.5): Why exactly is Dallas favored here? The defense has taken a significant step backward since that first game post-trade deadline against the Raiders. It's basically the same unit it was before the deadline. The offense can obviously move the ball against pretty much anyone, but the Chargers aren't just anyone. As Dajani mentioned, they're shutting down just about everybody in recent weeks. Prediction: Chargers 27, Cowboys 23\nJacksonville Jaguars at Denver Broncos (-3.5)\nDajani (Jaguars +3.5): The most underrated storyline in the NFL over the past couple weeks has been the reemergence of Trevor Lawrence. He accounted for 381 total yards and six touchdowns against the New York Jets last week, and before you say, \"So? It was the Jets,\" I thought Lawrence played one of his best games of the season the week prior against the Indianapolis Colts in a rainstorm. He's playing with confidence and has found a rhythm when it comes to throwing the ball down the field.\nJakobi Meyers has been a big part of this turnaround, as Lawrence actually leads the NFL in yards per attempt since Jacksonville made that trade. I mean, the Jaguars are averaging 33.3 points per contest in the six games since the trade deadline. That ranks second in the NFL behind the mighty Rams. The elite Broncos defense hasn't allowed many quarterbacks to look good this season, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say the Broncos' 11-game win streak ends this week. Prediction: Jaguars 27, Broncos 23Dubin (Broncos -3.5): I'm very excited to see whether Trevor Lawrence can keep up his recent run of production, against a quality defense. I've been reluctant to buy into the Broncos all year and they just keep proving me wrong by winning games in spots I expect them to lose. Now that I'm finally in, they'll probably prove me wrong again and lose here. Especially because I've also been reluctant to buy in on the Jaguars and am remaining so here because of concerns that this run they've been on has mostly come against some poor opponents. Prediction: Broncos 20, Jaguars 16Pittsburgh Steelers at Detroit Lions (-6.5)\nDajani (Lions -6.5): The Steelers are feeling good following their blowout victory over the Miami Dolphins, but good luck outscoring the Lions. This unit leads the NFL with 30.6 points per game and averages 91.8 more yards per game than Pittsburgh. Aaron Rodgers' offense ranks last in the NFL in time of possession (27:26) and offensive plays run per game (55.7). \nMeanwhile, this Steelers pass defense ranks bottom six in the NFL, so Jared Goff could have a field day. The Lions are desperate for a win, as they would be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss. Prediction: Lions 30, Steelers 20Dubin (Lions -6.5): I feel the same way about this game as Dajani does. I just don't think the Steelers can score enough to keep up with the Lions -- even against an injury-ravaged Detroit defense. You can run on the Steelers, as we have seen in recent weeks, and this feels like a game where Jahmyr Gibbs gets back on track in a big way after he struggled to run the ball against the Rams last week. Unless an offensive explosion comes out of nowhere for Pittsburgh, I like the Lions to win big. Prediction: Lions 31, Steelers 17\nNew England Patriots at Baltimore Ravens (-3) (SNF)\nDajani (Patriots +3): I wasn't incredibly impressed by the Ravens' win over the hapless Bengals. Sad boy Joe Burrow played the second-worst game of his NFL career in front of his home fans as he potentially mulls either retirement or a trade request. \nWhile the Patriots blew a 21-0 lead to Buffalo, it was about time they found the loss column. It had been almost three months since their last loss, and now they have the opportunity to reset, refocus and rebound. The Patriots are 6-1 SU and ATS in their last seven road games, while Drake Maye is 3-0 SU and ATS in prime-time games. On the flip side, the Ravens are 5-9 ATS on the year, which is tied for the worst mark in the NFL. Prediction: Patriots 28, Ravens 21Dubin (Ravens -3): I'm sort of wondering why the Ravens are even favored in this game considering the context of these two teams' seasons, and that has me thinking Vegas knows something about the matchup that we don't. Baltimore's defense has played better since recovering from the early-season injuries, and it may be tough for Drake Maye and Co. to have a huge game here. Couple that with New England's own backslide against the run defensively, and I'm going with what I think is maybe an upset but the fine folks at DraftKings apparently do not. Prediction: Ravens 24, Patriots 20San Francisco 49ers (-5.5) at Indianapolis Colts (MNF)\nDajani (49ers -5.5): Grandpa Rivers did a pretty solid job in his return to the field last week against Seattle. It's almost embarrassing that the Seahawks needed a game-winning field goal to win. I imagine Lucas Oil Stadium is going to be rocking for this prime-time matchup, but the difference in this game is going to be the 49ers offense vs. the Colts defense.\nThe versatile Christian McCaffrey has been one of the best players in the entire NFL this season, George Kittle has crossed 65 yards receiving in five straight games, Jauan Jennings caught two touchdowns last week and Brock Purdy has found a rhythm. With the number under a touchdown, I have to roll with the 49ers. Prediction: 49ers 24, Colts 16Dubin (49ers -5.5): Count me among those that did not actually think that Philip Rivers' return to the field was at all impressive. He looked like a 44-year-old grandfather who can't really throw the ball. Seemingly everyone can throw on the 49ers, so maybe he gets going here, but I doubt it. On the other side of the ball, I think San Francisco can get something going against the Indianapolis defense. Even potentially without Ricky Pearsall, there are just too many weapons for them to get shut down, especially if Sauce Gardner is not going to be out there. Prediction: 49ers 27, Colts 16\n            ",

Kentucky was No. 9. Fast-forward to the present, and the Red Storm are all the way down at No. 22, and the Wildcats are unranked. In other words, things haven't gone as planned -- for either team. And that's why unless North Carolina's Caleb Wilson does something to make us reconsider which five-star freshmen will be the ACC Player of the Year, or unless Ohio State's Bruce Thornton goes big in an upset, the story coming out of Saturday's CBS Sports Classic will likely be whichever team loses the first game of the doubleheader here inside State Farm Arena.St. John's or Kentucky?Who takes it? Who doesn't?The victor will add a Quadrant-1 win to the resume while the loser watches its fanbase meltdown again following another defeat. Fun times. Either way, the expectation is that Jayden Quaintance will make his debut for UK after missing the first 11 games while recovering from an ACL tear suffered last season while playing at Arizona State.He could be a real difference-maker.Quaintance, a 6-foot-9 forward, is slotted 11th in Kyle Boone's latest 2026 NBA Mock Draft thanks in part to a 7-foot-5 wingspan that allows him to block and alter shots at a high rate. His block-percentage last season was 9.8, which ranked 11th nationally, according to KenPom.com. Quaintance's presence alone should change how St. John's tries to attack UK's defense.\n        \n            \n                College basketball picks, schedule: Predictions for Duke vs. Texas Tech, more top 25 games\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSt. John's is No. 21 in Saturday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the 11th straight day.

    "body": "\n        Though Fantasy football league settings vary, a vast majority of players are in some kind of Fantasy playoff matchup as the Week 16 NFL season unfolds. That means the pressure to make the right Fantasy football start-sit decisions ramps up, and it's never easy this time of year as injury lists grow and the weather becomes more of a factor in many matchups.Which players should you feel comfortable putting in your Week 16 Fantasy football lineups with the season on the line? Before making your Week 16 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 16 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 16 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 16 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 16: The model is fading Giants receiver Wan'Dale Robinson, despite him averaging 81.3 yards with two scores over his last three games, and being the WR9 in PPR leagues on the season. He's being started in nearly 60% of leagues this week. Robinson has a brutal Sunday matchup versus Minnesota, which has allowed the fewest Fantasy points to opposing wide receivers this season. No wideout has scored in six straight games versus Minnesota, as it's kept the likes of CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens and Jaxon Smith-Njigba out of the end zone. Another curveball: The model is high on Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, despite him having one or fewer passing TDs in four of his last five games and being started in just 43% of leagues this week. The outlier during this five-game stretch came on Sunday, when Nix tied a career-high with four TDs, along with 302 passing yards, versus an elite Green Bay defense. That caliber of defense won't be what he sees on Sunday with the Jags, who rank No. 20 versus the pass. For more start/sit Fantasy football advice, be sure to check out the rest of the Week 16 Fantasy football rankings.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2  in select states.How to set Week 16 Fantasy football rankingsThe model is also calling for a surprising wideout you aren't even thinking about to finish in the top 15 of its Week 16 Fantasy football rankings, even slotted ahead the likes of Justin Jefferson and D.K. Metcalf. This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 16 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising wide receiver could lead you to victory? Visit SportsLine now to get Week 16 Fantasy football rankings for every position, plus see which wideout is going to come out of nowhere to crack the top 15 all from the model that has outperformed experts big-time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                WWE\n            \n            \n    \n        The time is now. John Cena is set for his WWE farewell as part of Saturday Night's Main Event. The legendary wrestler completes a year-long goodbye to professional wrestling in Washington D.C. when he takes on Gunther in his final match in active competition. Gunther stood tall at the end of a 16-man tournament featuring superstars from Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and surprise opponents from Cena's past. After losing the world heavyweight title to Jey Uso at WrestleMania 41, Gunther had an odd year. He lost his mind as fans taunted him for tapping out against Uso and attacked both Michael Cole and Pat McAfee, which led to a match with McAfee at Backlash. Gunther then beat Uso in a rematch to reclaim the world heavyweight title before a detour to take on a retiring Goldberg. Gunther then dropped the world heavyweight title at SummerSlam before going on hiatus for multiple injuries.Cena's final year has been up and down with some incredible highs and a couple forgettable lows. He began the year by coming up short in the Royal Rumble when it was down to him and Jey Uso. Then, the infamous heel turn at the Elimination Chamber when Cena joined forces with The Rock and Travis Scott to beat down Cody Rhodes after earning his spot at WrestleMania. Cena then beat Rhodes at the event to break the record of most recognized championships at 17. After the title run and subsequent face turn came the return of Brock Lesnar to the fold where he and Cena faced off at Wrestlepalooza. Cena has also had fun throwback matches with CM Punk and AJ Styles along the way.Saturday night's card will also feature three matches between talents from Raw and SmackDown against talents from NXT, as one of Cena's final requests from the promotion was to showcase the future talent of the business against the top stars of today. That includes undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes taking on NXT champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee in tag team action against Je'Von Evans and Leon Slater as well as Bayley taking on Sol Ruca.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWhere to watch 2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main EventDate: Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C.Start time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: Peacock (subscription required)2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main Event match cardJohn Cena vs. GuntherCody Rhodes vs. Oba FemiBayley vs. Sol RucaAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je'Von Evans & Leon Slater\n            \n    ",

Tigres enter with a 1-0 lead in the two-legged affair thanks to Angel Correa's solo goal as he looks to push Tigres to their first title since 2023, when they won the Clausura. Here's everything to know about the huge match which you can watch live on CBS Sports Network.How to watch Toluca vs. Tigres, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Nemesio Diez -- Toluca, MexicoTV: CBS Sports Network Odds: Toluca -105; Draw +280; Tigres +250Correa's arrival in Mexico during the summer from Atletico Madrid has pushed Tigres to new heights while also turning around his own career. After being a rotational player in Spain, Correa joined ahead of the Club World Cup and hasn't looked back, scoring 15 goals and assisting four more in all competitions for Tigres. His eight goals during the regular season helped the team cope with injuries to Andre-Pierre Gignac, and now Tigres seem well placed for when the 40-year-old eventually decides to hang up his boots. But there are titles to win first, as Gignac, Correa, and Juan Brunetta will look to give the Toluca defense fits. But that doesn't mean that Toluca will go down easily. They come in atop the pile after earning the top seed in the playoffs while also looking to defend their Clausura 2025 trophy, where they took down Club America. Behind the hot scoring of Paulinho, Antonio Mohamed's Toluca side have become a tough-to-break-down outfit, and hosting this second leg, this will be a back-and-forth affair at the Estadio Nemesio Diez. Attackers may take the headlines, but these are also the teams that allowed the fewest goals in league play, with Tigres allowing 16 and Toluca allowing 18 in their 17 matches played. Goals could be hard to come by, but with it being the second leg in a final, things could open up if one side has to chase the match late.\nIn four of the last five finals, the second leg has seen at least two goals scored, and three of those saw three or more goals scored, so going by form, there will be goals despite the strength of these defenses. Only one team can win, and with only one goal separating them, it's anyone's guess who will win the Apertura final. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With 500 career saves within reach, veteran closer Kenley Jansen has agreed to a one-year contract with the Detroit Tigers, reports ESPN. The deal will pay him $11 million and includes a club option for 2027. The team has not yet officially announced the signing. We did not rank Jansen among our top 50 free agents this offseason.Jansen, 38, spent this past season with the Los Angeles Angels, where he went 29 for 30 in save chances with a 2.59 ERA in 59 innings. The under-the-hood numbers are not as strong as they were during Jansen's prime, though he remains a solid to above-average reliever, one who won't wilt under pressure in important late-inning situations for a contending team.With a full and healthy season in 2026, Jansen is in line to become the third pitcher in history with 500 saves. Here is the all-time saves leaderboard:Mariano Rivera: 652 (Hall of Famer)Trevor Hoffman: 601 (Hall of Famer)Lee Smith: 478 (Hall of Famer)Kenley Jansen: 476Craig Kimbrel: 440Jansen needs 24 saves to join the 500-saves club, a total he has eclipsed in every 162-game season since 2012. Does 500 saves punch his ticket to the Hall of Fame? Jansen is one of the best relievers of his generation, and 500 saves, while not as sexy as 500 home runs, is an awfully big number. You don't get there without longevity and effectiveness. Cooperstown beckons.\n\"Four more years. That's the goal, man,\" Jansen told reporters, including the Associated Press, when asked how much longer he wants to play on the final day of the 2025 regular season.  \"The offseason begins tomorrow. No kidding. I'm  getting in my gym at 5 a.m. I want to drop a few more pounds, get  stronger, get a little quicker. I'm dedicated.\"As for the 2026 Tigers, Jansen will step into the closer's role, allowing manager A.J. Hinch to use righties Kyle Finnegan and Will Vest as \"Moment of Truth\" relievers who pitch in high-leverage situations regardless of the inning. With the caveat that there is a long way to go between now and Opening Day, Detroit's bullpen currently looks like this:Closer: RHP Kenley JansenSetup: RHP Kyle Finnegan and RHP Will VestMiddle: RHP Beau Brieske, LHP Tyler Holton, LHP Bailey HornLong: RHP Brenan Hanifee and LHP Brant HurterThere's room for another established reliever, perhaps a lefty who misses more bats than Holton, Hinch's current go-to southpaw. There is plenty of offseason to sort that out. For now, though, Jansen gives the Tigers an established closer, one who pushes Finnegan and Vest into setup roles. Jansen, meanwhile, will continue his march to 500 saves.\nThe Tigers went 87-75 in 2025, one game better than 2024. They were eliminated from the postseason in Game 5 of the ALDS in both seasons.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool were able to get back to their winning ways in the Premier League, defeating Brighton 2-0 at Anfield on Saturday. A brace from Hugo Ekitike was enough to keep Liverpool in front of Brighton, but the second goal was a significant one due to it being assisted by Mohamed Salah following his whirlwind week with the club. Following positive discussions with Arne Slot, Salah was included in the squad and got called upon much earlier than many would've expected, as Joe Gomez left the match due to an injury, and Salah was introduced in the 22nd minute of play. It wasn't a vintage performance by any sense of the term, with him taking three shots and netting an assist, but after claiming that the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, any contribution is more than what was expected.\nSalah will now depart to join the Egyptian national team for the Africa Cup of Nations, but manager Arne Slot expects him to come back to the club at the conclusion of the tournament amid transfer speculation. \"Actions speak louder than what I can say about it, [Salah] was here, so that tells you how the conversation yesterday went, and he was the first substitute I made, so that already gives an answer to all the questions that you have,\" Slot said following the match.\"He goes to the AFCON, and we have a lot of games to play and yeah, he's a Liverpool player, so I expect him to be back afterwards.\"\nWith interest from the Saudi Premier League, there is wonder of where Salah will play his soccer once the January transfer window opens, but if his manager is to be believed, it will be at Liverpool. Granted, there isn't much else that Slot can say publicly, but after Salah was benched in three consecutive matches and left out of the squad for their 1-0 victory over Inter in Champions League play midweek, this is an improvement.Fans also chanted Salah's name following the full-time whistle as he was the last player to leave the pitch at Anfield. It wasn't a moment that read as a goodbye from Liverpool, but it was something that was meaningful for him.\nThat was Salah's third Premier League assist of the season and one that helped showcase the breakout that Ekitike is having for the Reds. He now has seven goals in the league, and in a season that has seen Salah's scoring dip while Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz have struggled to integrate into the side, his performances have been a silver lining for Liverpool.\nWithout Salah, Ekitike will be relied on, but if the Reds can get the two of them going together following AFCON, there could be hope for the season with Salah's future looking a little more red than last week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman Trophy as the most outstanding player in college football. He beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love and Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin for the honor. The Hoosiers' signal caller earned 643 first-place votes, 191 second-place votes and 51 third-place votes. Pavia finished second with 189 first-place votes, 352 second-place votes and 164 for third. Mendoza came from humble beginnings, rated as the No. 134 quarterback in the Class of 2022. Before he earned a late offer from California, he was set to go to Yale and play in the Ivy League. Even after arriving in Berkeley, he had to battle for the starting job each season before finally settling in and breaking out as a sophomore. \n        \n            \n                Who will be at forefront of 2026 Heisman race?

Instead of choosing a traditional power, he was sold on Indiana coach Curt Cignetti, offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and a rising program in Bloomington. His brother Alberto was also a quarterback at the school, but the addition of Fernando proved to be one of the greatest in program history.\nDuring Indiana's historic run to the No. 1 overall seed in the College Football Playoff, Mendoza was sensational. The junior completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards and led college football with 33 passing touchdowns. The Hoosiers won the Big Ten outright for the first time since 1945 with a perfect 13-0 record. Unlike nearly every other candidate, Mendoza had multiple Heisman moments. In a 27-24 comeback win against Penn State, he led a game-winning drive and connected with Omar Cooper on an acrobatic touchdown that will be replayed for years. In the Big Ten Championship Game against Ohio State, he took a third-down snap and hit Charlie Becker for a 33-yard pass that helped the Hoosiers run out the clock in a 13-10 upset. \nNow, the Heisman winner prepares to take Indiana into the CFP. The Hoosiers play the winner of No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Alabama in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Indiana has never won a national championship.  \nSurprisingly, Mendoza is the first Heisman Trophy winner to play in the CFP since Alabama's Bryce Young in 2021. Young led the Crimson Tide to the national title game before falling just short to rival Georgia. Between 2014 and 2021, seven of the eight Heisman winners earned a trip to the CFP.  Mendoza is also the first Big Ten player to win the Heisman Trophy since Ohio State's Troy Smith in 2006, and just the second in the 21st Century. USC and Oregon have produced a combined five Heismans since 2000, but all came while members of the Pac-12. Indiana has not produced a Heisman finalist since running back Anthony Thompson in 1989. 2025 Heisman Trophy voting    RankPlayerSchool1st2nd3rdTotal points1Fernando MendozaIndiana643191512,3622Diego PaviaVanderbilt1893521641,4353Jeremiyah LoveNotre Dame461572677194Julian SayinOhio State81181724325Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech17561322956Jeremiah SmithOhio State4183684 Elevating the Hoosiers Indiana reached the College Football Playoff last season, but lost by double-digits against Notre Dame as the offense struggled to create opportunities. Statistically, the unit hasn't been much different in 2025. Against elite competition, though, Mendoza has proven to be a significant upgrade.  \nIn historic wins over No. 1 Ohio State and No. 3 Oregon, Mendoza completed 65% of his passes and averaged 8.1 yards per attempt against two of the best defenses in college football. He completed the game-changing 33-yard pass against Ohio State to run out the clock. Total stats tell part of the story, but his ascension in key moments has been the difference between excellent and national caliber at Indiana.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the 2025 Heisman Trophy race decided, it's time to start looking ahead to the 2026 Heisman race. The outlook for college football's most prestigious individual award will be partially determined by NFL Draft and transfer portal decisions finalized during the weeks ahead.But even as we wait to see how the sport's shifting roster dynamics play out and where some potential star players will land -- or if they'll remain in college football at all -- there are a few obvious early frontrunners. A couple of them are Ohio State stars who were in the mix this season.Buckeyes quarterback Julian Sayin made it to New York as a finalist this season behind a standout redshirt freshman campaign. His top target, Jeremiah Smith, finished sixth in the 2025 voting as a sophomore. It would be no surprise if either or both are in New York next year with a chance to hoist the hardware.There will be plenty of competition, however. Quarterbacks Arch Manning (Texas), Marcel Reed (Texas A&M) and Jayden Maiava (USC) are each draft-eligible, but they're poised to be in the Heisman mix if they return. Here's an early rundown of 2026 Heisman Trophy contenders.\nTop Heisman contenders in 2026\n    \n                                        \n    Arch Manning, QB, TexasManning ended the 2025 season trending in the right direction. He totaled 15 touchdowns as a passer and runner with just two interceptions over the Longhorns' final five regular season games and surpassed 300 yards passing in three of those contests. Though he is draft-eligible, Manning needs to return to college football to continue his development.\n    \n                                        \n    Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio StateSayin was the only 2025 Heisman Trophy finalist who is not draft eligible in 2026, and he should be in store for a huge redshirt sophomore season. Ohio State is poised to be elite at receiver again, and Sayin has already proven himself as one of the most accurate passers college football has seen in a generation. He should be right back in the mix a year from now.Jeremiah Smith, WR, Ohio StateSmith finished sixth in the 2025 Heisman Trophy voting after totaling 80 grabs for 1,086 yards and 11 touchdowns through the Big Ten Championship Game. The former five-star prospect is capable of making plays that few others can, and he will have numerous school records in his sights next season as a junior.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Marcel Reed, QB, Texas A&MReed can soft launch his 2026 Heisman Trophy campaign with a strong performance in the CFP. The dual-threat playmaker established a strong baseline by throwing for nearly 3,000 yards and 25 touchdowns while leading Texas A&M to an 11-1 regular season. He'll be working with a new offensive coordinator next season amid Collin Klein's departure to become Kansas State's coach.\n    \n                                        \n    Jayden Maiava, QB, USCUSC coach Lincoln Riley has already produced three Heisman Trophy winners. It takes little imagination to envision Maiava becoming the fourth. He led the Big Ten with 3,431 passing yards in the regular season while leading the Trojans to a 9-3 mark. If USC makes the CFP in 2026, Maiava will be in New York as a Heisman finalist.Other names to knowTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Simpson is draft-eligible, but if he returns to college football, he is bound for a big year. Though his performance tapered off in the second half of the 2025 season, he's an accurate passer surrounded by talent.Gunner Stockton, QB, Georgia: Stockton proved himself to be more than capable of running the show for Georgia in 2025. He delivered in clutch moments as both a runner and passer and should be even better in 2026.Drew Mestemaker, QB, North Texas: Will Mestemaker follow coach Eric Morris from North Texas to Oklahoma State? That remains to be seen, but after leading the FBS in passing yards at 4,129, he'll be a potential factor in the Heisman race regardless of where he plays.Sam Leavitt, QB, Arizona State: Signs suggest Leavitt is transferring after an injury-abbreviated redshirt sophomore season. Don't be surprised if he lands with a big-name program and puts up big-time numbers.Ahmad Hardy, RB, Missouri: Hardy ranks second in the FBS in rushing yards at 1,560, making him one of the 2025 season's most valuable transfers. After beginning his career at Louisiana-Monroe, Hardy has blossomed into a star.\nKewan Lacy, RB, Ole Miss: Lacy ranks second in the FBS in rushing touchdowns with 20 after emerging as one of the sport's top breakout stars. The Missouri transfer is averaging five yards per carry and also has 25 receptions.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the most-anticipated games of the season has finally arrived, and the winner of the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy will be solidified as Army and Navy renew their storied rivalry on CBS to cap college football's regular season. The Midshipmen (9-2) and Black Knights (6-5) each beat Air Force this season to set up a winner-take-all showdown as the annual round-robin between the service academies concludes with the 126th edition of the Army vs. Navy Game.Navy won last year's battle 31-13 to take hold of the trophy and snap a two-game losing streak against Army. The Black Knights will be hankering for revenge and entering with some momentum after bouncing back from a 1-3 start to win five of their past seven. Navy also enters with some wind at its back after beating AAC stalwarts South Florida in Memphis in its past two games. Another victory would give the Midshipmen back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in program history with a bowl game still ahead. Navy is led once again by star quarterback Blake Horvath, a multi-dimensional senior who has already surpassed 1,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing. Army's attack is led by quarterback Cale Hellums, who enters with 1,078 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. Follow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.\n        \n            \n                2025 Army vs. Navy Game uniforms: Black Knights, Midshipmen will honor 250 years of service in 126th meeting\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the NIL era and mass transfer era, this storied rivalry has become even more distinct than ever before. Athletes at service academies do not make NIL money and transfer at a significantly lower rate than those at mainstream schools. They play for the love of the game, and there is no bigger game than Army vs. Navy.\nWhat should you expect next Saturday? Let's take a look.Where to watch Army vs. Navy liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MarylandTV: CBS | Live stream: Paramount + Premium, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Army vs. Navy: Need to knowHorvath's big game: After three straight games in the series decided by six points or less, Navy's 31-13 victory last season marked a rare lopsided margin in the series. Navy quarterback Blake Horvath totaled more than 300 yards and four touchdowns, shining as both a runner and passer while putting an exclamation point on a breakout season. His 52-yard touchdown pass midway through the third quarter to Eli Heidenreich put Navy ahead 21-10 and proved to be a critical blow.Army's tribute: Army is commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's existence by wearing special uniforms that will include purple streaking through the numbers and helmet. It's meant as a tribute to the sacrifices of those who served. The uniform's color will be a marble tint that is designed to symbolize \"the enduring foundation of strength that the American people have provided for the Army.\" The helmets feature the year \"1775\" spelled out on the back.\nNavy's uniform story: Navy's uniform was inspired by the USS Constitution, which is the only remaining frigate from the Navy's original fleet. The vessel known as \"Old Ironsides\" was once used as floating classroom space in the 19th century. It has been out of service since 1881. The \"Old Ironsides\" nickname cam in the War of 1812 when the USS Constitution went undefeated in battle.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most prestigious award in college football will be handed out Saturday night as four of the top athletes in the nation descend upon New York City for the 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is seen as the favorite to capture the prize after leading the Hoosiers to their best season in program history, but he will have stiff competition from other top signal callers from around the sport. Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love round out the list of four finalists that will take the stage inside the Lincoln Center's Appel Room. Mendoza and Sayin are gearing up for an appearance in the College Football Playoff after dueling in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Indiana won to capture its first outright conference title in 80 years. Pavia and Love, obviously, had successful seasons while starring for a pair of 10-win programs. The odds favor another quarterback winning the Heisman after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter earned the award last season. Hunter's triumph snapped a streak of three straight quarterback Heisman winners. A quarterback also won the Heisman seven times from 2016-23. The 2025 Heisman Trophy ceremony will begin at 7 p.m. ET and air on ESPN. It can also be streamed live on fuboTV (Try for free).  \nOdds in parentheses below via DraftKings Sportsbook.2025 Heisman Trophy finalists, oddsFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (-2500): Mendoza took a commanding lead in the Heisman standings following a heroic performance in the Big Ten Championship Game. He completed 15 of his 23 pass attempts for 222 yards and the decisive 17-yard touchdown to wide receiver Elijah Sarratt. Mendoza leads the nation with 33 touchdowns passing to just six interceptions and he's also rushed for another six touchdowns on the ground. He would be the first Heisman Trophy winner in Indiana history. Diego Pavia, QB, Vanderbilt (+1100): Like Mendoza, Pavia can make history as Vanderbilt's first Heisman recipient. He's already lead the Commodores to their first 10-win season in program history, capped by their first victory against Tennessee since 2018. Pavia's established himself as one of the most electric playmakers in the country. He averaged 465.5 total yards per game and scored 16 total touchdowns in Vanderbilt's final four games. Jeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (+25000): Love is holding it down as the only non-quarterback that made the cut as a Heisman finalist. It's not hard to see why. He almost singlehandedly provided the offensive firepower for a Notre Dame team that just missed out on the College Football Playoff. He was one of just two players to average at least 6.9 yards per carry while toting the rock over 150 times. His 18 touchdowns rushing also ranked third in the FBS. \nJulian Sayin, QB, Ohio State (+50000): Sayin is a smooth operator in Ohio State's explosive offense. His 78.4% completion percentage leads the nation and his 182.1 passer rating is first among FBS quarterbacks with at least 100 pass attempts on the year. He failed to complete 70% of his passes in just two games all season. Though Ohio State's elite skill position players get a lot of credit for Sayin's success, his own talent is evident with his ability to deliver the ball accurately to every level of the field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Utah coach Kyle Whittingham is stepping down from his post, the school announced on Friday. Whittingham, 66, has been Utah's coach since 2005 and has been with the program as a position coach since 1994. Morgan Scalley, a Utah assistant since 2007 and Whittingham's defensive coordinator since 2016, will take over as head coach. \"The time is right to step down from my position as the head coach at the University of Utah,\" Whittingham said in a statement. \"It's been an honor and a privilege to lead the program for the past 21 years, and I'm very grateful for the relationships forged with all the players and assistant coaches that have worked so hard and proudly worn the drum and feather during our time here.\"The opportunity to guide so many talented young men as they pursued their goals -- both on and off the field -- has truly been a blessing. Thank you to the university, the Salt Lake community, all of Ute Nation and most of all my wife and family for your unwavering support that has helped make Utah Football what it is today.\"Whittingham, who began his tenure at Utah 32 years ago as defensive line coach under Ron McBride, took over for Urban Meyer in 2005 after the Utes completed a 12-0 season and won the 2005 Fiesta Bowl in dominant fashion over Pittsburgh. He went 177-88 overall across 21 seasons, overseeing Utah's transition from the Mountain West into the Power Five when it joined the Pac-12 in 2011 and again transitioned into the Big 12 in 2024.\nThough there were disappointing seasons, Whittingham led the Utes to eight double-digit win campaigns, including four of the last seven seasons. The Athletic reported that Whittingham is not retiring from coaching and could seek other coaching opportunities. The Utes are set to face Nebraska on Dec. 31 in the Las Vegas Bowl, which will be the final game of Whittingham's final game leading the program. Under Whittingham, Utah finished with a winning record in 18 of his 21 seasons as the coach.Morgan Scalley will take over for Whittingham Utah announced the promotion of Scalley to head coach on Saturday. Scalley, 46, played at Utah as a defensive back from 2001-04 and started his coaching career as a graduate assistant with the Utes in 2007. From there, he worked his way up to safeties coach and recruiting coordinator before taking the defensive coordinator role in 2016.\n\"Morgan Scalley has proven over the course of his outstanding coaching and playing career at the University of Utah that he is uniquely equipped to take over as the program's next leader,\" Utah athletic director Mark Harlan said in a statement. \"He not only has great knowledge and perspective of what makes Utah football special, but his passion and love for the University of Utah position him to carry the mantle of leadership forward and continue the program's legacy of success.\"Last summer, Utah officially named Scalley as the program's coach-in-waiting. Scalley was a finalist for the 2019 Broyles Award, given annually to the top assistant coach in college football, after Utah boasted the nation's top run defense.\"Being a part of the Utah Football Program was a childhood dream of mine that has turned into an incredible 25-year journey that I am blessed to say is continuing,\" Scalley said. \"My coaching journey began when Kyle Whittingham decided to take a chance on me. I am forever indebted to him for believing in me and giving me opportunity after opportunity to grow in this profession. He has mentored me, inspired me, and given me a vision for the future of the Utah Football Program, and I am ready and excited to see it through.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers' return to the gridiron is being fast-tracked, as the Indianapolis Colts have activated the 44-year-old quarterback for their Week 15 road matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. Rivers will start on Sunday, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reports, after ending his five-year retirement on Tuesday by signing with the Colts practice squad. Now, he's on the verge of once again being a starting quarterback. The Colts are desperate at quarterback. Daniel Jones suffered a torn Achilles in last Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture. Rookie Riley Leonard, who was expected to replace Jones in the starting lineup, has a knee injury, but is off the injury report. With the Colts' season on the line at 8-5, they are likely turning to the quarterback that last led them to the playoffs.Rivers spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, but his last season came in 2020 with the Colts. He threw for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while the Colts went 11-5 and earned a wild card spot. Rivers' final NFL game came on Jan. 9, 2021 -- a 27-24 playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills, in which he completed 27 of 46 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns. An eight-time Pro Bowler, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter in his incredible career, and ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). Fewer than five months ago, Rivers signed a one-day contract with the Chargers and announced his retirement. The franchise even put out an emotional video. But things have changed and Rivers will be back in an NFL uniform on Sunday in Seattle. \nWhy did the Colts sign Rivers?Why did the Colts go and sign the 44-year-old Rivers instead of a free agent like Ryan Tannehill, or maybe even another NFL legend like Tom Brady? It's likely because Rivers has familiarity with the Colts franchise, coach Shane Steichen and the team's offensive system. Rivers has been a high school football coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic, where he coaches his son Gunner Rivers -- who is also a quarterback. CBS Sports broadcaster and NFL legend J.J. Watt recently learned that Rivers ran the same offense as the Colts for his son's team. If you don't believe that, Rivers and Steichen apparently spoke weekly about their scheme, discussing plays and even film. It's a reason why the Colts are expected to start Rivers five days after he rejoined the NFL. \n        \n            \n                Philip Rivers' impossible comeback, Joe Burrow's unrest and what sources are saying around the NFL\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe historical impactIf he starts as expected, Rivers will become the fifth quarterback to start an NFL game at age 44 or older. He adds his name to a list that includes Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Sunday marks 1,800 days since Rivers' last NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research. It's the longest layoff by a 40-year-old starting quarterback in NFL history. The previous record was DeBerg in 1998 (1,777 days). \nRivers is older than Steichen and Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, making it the sixth instance since 1950 where a starting quarterback was older than both head coaches in a game. In fact, Rivers is older than 13 NFL head coaches. Rivers has 10 children and is a grandfather. Now, he has been charged with saving the Colts' season. The matchup against SeattleThe Seahawks are a tough matchup for Rivers right off the bat, as Seattle already matched its win total from last season at 10-3 and boasts a ferocious defense. This unit ranks second in the NFL in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per play allowed (4.5) and third-down defense (33%). Seattle has allowed just nine total points over the past two games, and leads the NFL with six non-offensive touchdowns.\nUnfortunately for the Colts, the Week 15 matchup against Seattle isn't the only tough game remaining on the schedule. Indy actually has the toughest remaining schedule in the NFL (.692 opponent win percentage). Three of the Colts' final four opponents rank top seven in the NFL in pressures. WeekOpponent15at Seattle Seahawks16vs. San Francisco 49ers17vs. Jacksonville Jaguars18at Houston TexansColts' chances to make the playoffsWhat are the chances Rivers can come in and deliver for the Colts, stop their slide and get Indy back to the postseason?

But the Colts were crashing even before their quarterback went down. The Colts lost three straight games since starting 8-2, and also lost star cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck) to injury. Indianapolis is in danger of becoming the first NFL team to start 8-2 or better and miss the playoffs since the 1995 Oakland Raiders, but the Colts are hoping this Hail Mary at quarterback pays immediate dividends. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arizona State and coach Kenny Dillingham are working toward an agreement on an updated contract as speculation swirls around his potential candidacy for the opening at Michigan, according to 247Sports. The two sides are \"close\" to reaching an agreement for a new deal, which would include an increase to his annual base salary.Dillingham confirmed after practice Saturday that Arizona State and his agent began working on contract amendments shortly after the conclusion of the regular season. The talks between athletic director Graham Rossini and Dillingham's agent have continued over the past two weeks, per 247Sports. The discussions, which took on added urgency following Michigan's firing of Sherrone Moore earlier this week, are focused on increasing Dillingham's guaranteed compensation and making his contract less dependent on performance-based incentives. Dillingham said Saturday he has not spoken with Michigan or any other programs regarding coaching vacancies.Dillingham had already triggered an automatic $200,000 raise by winning eight regular-season games, which would increase his 2025 base salary from $5.8 million to $6 million, along with an automatic one-year extension through Dec. 31, 2030. Any amended contract would need approval from the Arizona Board of Regents.\n        \n            \n                Michigan coaching candidates: Kalen DeBoer, Kenny Dillingham among options after sudden Sherrone Moore firing\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDillingham is an Arizona State alum: 'This is home'Dillingham was on the practice field Saturday as Arizona State prepared for the Sun Bowl against Duke on Dec. 31. The practice session, originally scheduled for 9 a.m. local time, was moved to 10:45 a.m.\nAfter practice, Dillingham was asked what makes coaching at Arizona State special. He paused for 20 seconds and became visibly emotional, with tears in his eyes, before answering.\"I love this place,\" Dillingham said. \"It's a special place to me.\"\nDillingham, 35, a Scottsdale native and Arizona State alumnus, has repeatedly expressed a desire to remain with the Sun Devils. Following the Nov. 15 win against West Virginia, amid swirling coaching rumors, he told reporters, \"I was never leaving,\" according to 247Sports.\"This is home,\" Dillingham said. \"But you do have to continue to push, and my job in running a program is to push and push and push until you can't push any more. If I didn't do that, I'd be cheating my players, I'd be cheating my staff, I'd be cheating my fanbase, I'd be cheating everyone in this city, I'd be cheating the local businesses that feed off us winning, I'd be cheating everyone. So my No. 1 goal, always, is to do whatever I can to push the envelope for Arizona State football.\"\nDillingham's potential long-term stay is influenced in part by family. He and his wife, Briana, both Arizona State graduates, are expecting their second child early next year, and his parents and in-laws live nearby. \"Having the family support here is a really cool thing,\" Dillingham said in an early November interview, noting that the proximity allows him to focus on the program.Since taking over as coach in 2023, Dillingham has helped elevate Arizona State to national relevance. The Sun Devils, coming off a Big 12 Championship and the program's first College Football Playoff berth in 2024, have posted a 19-7 record since the start of his second season. That Big 12 title came after the Sun Devils were picked to finish last in the conference in the preseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and with the Winter Meetings behind us, we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Saturday's roundup just below. Royals add Collins, MearsTwo days after signing Lane Thomas, the Royals have added another outfielder, this time fetching Isaac Collins in a three-player trade with the Brewers, reports The Athletic. The full trade: Collins and righty reliever Nick Mears for lefty reliever Angel Zerpa.\nCollins, 28, finished fourth in the NL Rookie of the Year voting this past season. He posted a .368 on-base percentage in 2025, though he struggled badly down the stretch, and started only one of Milwaukee's nine postseason games. Mears had a 3.49 ERA with 46 strikeouts in 56 ⅔ innings. Kansas City controls Collins through 2030 and Mears through 2027.Zerpa, 26, threw 64 ⅔ innings with a 4.18 ERA this past season. He has rare velocity for a lefty, regularly touching 100 mph. The Brewers are an excellent pitching organization and they're betting on Zerpa getting to another level. He is under team control through 2028. Three years of Zerpa for five of Collins may seem light for Brewers, though keep in mind Collins was an older rookie.\nCardinals agree to one-year deal with MayThe Cardinals and free-agent righty Dustin May have agreed to a one-year contract, reports ESPN. We ranked May as the 36th best free agent available this offseason, and wrote that he \"could end up being a value signing\" given his age (28) and the quality of his sinker/slider arsenal. The one-year deal is a nice upside play for the pitching-needy Cardinals.\nInjuries, including multiple elbow surgeries, limited May to 20 total starts from 2021-24. He made 23 not especially effective starts with the Dodgers and Red Sox in 2025, though, as he gets further away from his injuries, his performance could improve. If things go well in 2026, the Cardinals could look to sign May long-term, or trade him for a prospect(s) at the deadline. Tigers, Kenley Jansen agree to termsThe Tigers have agreed to a one-year contract with veteran closer Kenley Jansen, the Athletic reports. The deal also includes a club option for 2027. Jensen is 38 years of age, but he's coming off a strong season with the Angels in 2025: \nFor his standout career, Jansen boasts an ERA+ of 155 across parts of 16 MLB seasons. As well, Jansen's 476 career saves rank fourth all-time behind just Mariano Rivera (652), Trevor Hoffman (601), and Lee Smith (478). Barring injury or ineffectiveness, he seems likely to notch career save No. 500 in a Tigers uniform. Jansen is a four-time All-Star, and as a member of the Dodgers in 2017, he finished fifth in the National League Cy Young vote. Yankees re-up with Rosario\nThe Yankees have brought back utility player Amed Rosario on a one-year contract worth $2.5 million, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Last season, Rosario had an OPS+ of 109 in a combined 62 games for the Nationals and Yankees. He spent time at four different defensive positions, and for his career boasts an .800 OPS against left-handed pitching. The Yankees acquired him from the Nationals in a three-player trade leading up to this past season's deadline. Mets, Padres talking tradesThe Mets are in need of roster fortifications even after signing Jorge Polanco to a two-year free agent pact. The Padres, meanwhile, are trying to wring another year of contention out of their current core while also looking to reduce payroll at the behest of ownership. Those two aims have led to trade talks between the clubs. Here are the details from Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic: \n\"The Padres' players in the talks include right-hander Nick Pivetta, outfielder Ramón Laureano and relievers Mason Miller, Adrian Morejon and Jeremiah Estrada. San Diego, in turn, is asking the Mets about their young major leaguers and all of their top prospects, both pitchers and position players.\"Hard-throwing reliever Mason Miller, whom the Padres acquired from the A's at the most recent trade deadline, is the most intriguing name mentioned. The Mets recently lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers. While they did sign Devin Williams and can plug him in as a closer, the Mets are no doubt seeking another high-leverage arm for the bullpen. Miller certainly fits that bill. Red Sox interested in ContrerasSeeking to add power to their lineup, the Red Sox have interest in Cardinals first baseman Willson Contreras, Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports. Contreras is coming off a strong season with the Cardinals, and he backs it up with some of the best batted-ball metrics in baseball: \nThe former catcher is going into his age-34 season in 2026, and he's signed through 2027 with a club option for 2028. Contreras has a full no-trade clause and may prefer to stay in St. Louis despite the ongoing rebuild. That said, his right-handed pop would be an excellent fit for Fenway Park, and the Red Sox profile as strong contenders for 2026 and beyond. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Tampa Bay Buccaneers entered \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 15 hosting with everything to gain against the Atlanta Falcons, who had nothing to lose having already been eliminated from playoff contention, as six-point home favorites. Tampa Bay held a share of first place in the NFC South with the Carolina Panthers at 7-6, but they stunningly faltered in a 29-28 walk-off loss courtesy of a 43-yard field goal from kicker Zane Gonzalez that barely snuck inside of the left upright. How rare was it that the Falcons were able to erase their 14-point deficit, 28-14, in the fourth quarter on Thursday? Atlanta had failed to win their last 133 games when trailing by at least 14 points in the quarter with Thursday's victory representing the largest Falcons' fourth quarter comeback victory since 1993, per CBS Sports Research. Bet our bold predictions at DraftKings Sportsbook.What other shocking outcomes could happen  in Week 15's weekend NFL action full of playoff stakes and high profile quarterback matchups? Let's take a look with five bold predictions.     Eagles complete collapse with home loss vs. Kenny Pickett-led RaidersThe defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles are on a three-game losing streak after consecutive losses at the Dallas Cowboys, at home against the Chicago Bears and on the road in overtime against the Los Angeles Chargers. All three defeats have been agonizing in their own way: Philadelphia blew a 21-0 lead at Dallas, the Bears ran for 281 yards as a team and quarterback Jalen Hurts committed a career-high five turnovers, including the game-sealing interception in OT.\nNone of that will compare to the Eagles losing on Sunday in Philadelphia against the 2-11 Las Vegas Raiders as 11.5-point home favorites, according to DraftKings Sportsbook. The cherry on top in this defeat will be that it will come at the hands of former Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett. Pickett subbed in for an injured Geno Smith in the fourth quarter against the Denver Broncos, and he completed 8 of his 11 passes for 97 yards and a touchdown that came from 25 yards out. Pickett will be efficient, sixth overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty will run wild and the Raiders will cause the city of Philadelphia to melt down after stunning the Eagles and extending their losing streak to four. Philip Rivers throws at least two TDs, no turnovers vs. Seahawks at 44-years-oldThe Seattle Seahawks are the NFL's No. 2 scoring defense (17.4 points per game allowed) and No. 6 total defense (288.2 total yards per game allowed). They're one of the best units in football. \nHowever, 44-year-old, eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback Philip Rivers will throw for at least two touchdowns and not commit a turnover against them in his first NFL start in 1,800 days -- he last started a game with the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC wild card round against the Buffalo Bills on Jan. 9, 2021. This will be the longest layoff by a QB over 40 to start a game in NFL history. Rivers already has some chemistry with some of the Colts' top players: both running back Jonathan Taylor and wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. caught their first career touchdowns from Rivers back in the 2020 season. Colts head coach Shane Steichen was Rivers' quarterbacks coach with the Los Angeles Chargers from 2016-2019, and according to CBS Sports' JJ Watt, Rivers has been running Steichen's Colts offense as the coach of his son Gunnar's high school team. Watt also noted he and Steichen spoke \"weekly\" about it. The 44-year-old will parlay all that familiarity plus whatever talent he has left to start his 18th NFL season off with a bang.\nJosh Allen runs for 30-yard TD at PatriotsNo team has allowed fewer big plays, plays of 25-or-more yards, in 2025 than the New England Patriots' 14. Buffalo Bills 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen produced a 40-yard rushing touchdown last week in the snow against the Cincinnati Bengals to turn a 28-18 deficit with just over seven-and-a-half minutes remaining into a 39-34 victory. Despite facing a tight Patriots defense that doesn't allow big plays, he'll rip off a rushing touchdown of at least 30 yards in New England on Sunday afternoon. \nCaleb Williams avoids being sacked by Myles GarrettMyles Garrett appears to be on a preordained march toward NFL history this season: his 20.0 sacks are the most through a team's first 13 games of a season ever. Garrett needs just three sacks to break the all-time record of 22.5 that is currently shared by Hall of Famer Michael Strahan (2001) and Pittsburgh Steelers All-Pro T.J. Watt (2021). Avoiding being sacked by Garrett seems nearly impossible these days, but Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams is going to do just that on Sunday when he faces the Cleveland Browns. Williams faced Green Bay Packers All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, whose 12.5 sacks are tied for the third-most in the NFL, in Week 14 and evaded his clutches. Williams will continue his outside-the-pocket gunslinging and escape Garrett to delay the latter's pursuit of sack immortality another week. \nJacoby Brissett throws for 300-plus yards vs. Texans No. 1 defense\nThe Houston Texans all but extinguished the Kansas City Chiefs' 2025 playoff hopes by bullying three-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes into the worst game of his career: his first showing with no touchdowns and three or more (three) interceptions. Houston boasts the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (16.0 points per game allowed) and No. 1 total defense (266.3 total yards per game allowed), and they are the first team since Washington 1985 to allow under 225 passing yards in each of their first 13 games. That's notable considering they've played Matthew Stafford, Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes this season. However, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Jacoby Brissett will throw for over 300 yards on Sunday. He leads the NFL in passing yards (2,459) since becoming their starting quarterback in Week 6, which ranks as the fifth-most passing yards by a quarterback in his first eight starts with a team since 1950. Brissett's last four games against the following playoff teams all resulted in big numbers: 452 yards in Week 11 against the San Francisco 49ers, 317 yards in Week 12 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, 301 yards in Week 13 at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and 271 yards in Week 14  against the Los Angeles Rams.\nBrissett overcomes the Texans defense to stuff the sheet for 300 yards against a Houston team that hasn't allowed the best of the best to do so this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of Pacific Northwest foes will meet to kick off the college football bowl game schedule on Saturday when Washington and Boise State duel in the LA Bowl. Despite their close proximity in bordering states, it is just the seventh all-time meeting between the programs, and it marks their third bowl game matchup. A 10-win season is on the line for the Broncos, who also seek the first win over a Big Ten program in their storied history. The Huskies, meanwhile, could end the second year of the Jedd Fisch era with a ninth win and build momentum towards what should be a highly anticipated Year 3. Boise State fell short of its quest for a repeat College Football Playoff berth, but it did secure a spot in the LA Bowl by way of winning the Mountain West Championship Game. The Broncos became the first team to ever win the conference three years in a row, and their seventh title is the most in league history. They closed their Mountain West membership on top and will join the new-look Pac-12 next season. Washington was a CFP hopeful, as well, but had its chances dashed when it lost to rival Oregon in the regular-season finale. It is more than a touchdown favorite, per FanDuel, to bounce back with a victory in bowl season.  Washington vs. Boise State: Need to know Three-headed monster: Boise State this season faced the impossible task of replacing Ashton Jeanty. Instead of putting the onus on one player, it nearly matched the former Heisman Trophy finalist's 2024 production with three prolific running backs. Dylan Riley, Sire Gaines and Malik Sherrod each racked up at least 400 rushing yards and six total touchdowns and modernized the Broncos' backfield as reliable receivers, as well. That trio combined for 2,752 yards from scrimmage in the regular season and conference championship game. Coleman does it all: Washington features a versatile running back of its own. Jonah Coleman, a CBS Sports Midseason All-American, scored a Big Ten-best 16 total touchdowns across 11 games in what has been the best campaign of his career. A knee injury limited him for all of November, but if he is closer to full strength for the LA Bowl, the senior is a sure bet to handle 15-20 touches and to find the end zone at least once. \nMVP Madsen: Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen missed three games and nearly all of a fourth with a lower leg injury but returned in grand fashion for the Mountain West title game. The second-year starter passed for three touchdowns and ran for another in one of his most productive games of the season and earned the conference championship game MVP award for his efforts. He should be in the lineup again Saturday. Husky defense flexes down the stretch: Washington boasts the more consistent defense of the two in this matchup, and it closed the regular season on a hot streak. While they did surrender 26 points to Oregon in the finale, none of the Huskies' three prior opponents put more than 14 points on the scoreboard. And not a single team this season -- yes, that includes Ohio State, Illinois, Michigan and Oregon -- notched more than three touchdowns in a game against the nation's No. 22 scoring defense.  Where to watch Washington vs. Boise State live Date: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 8 p.m. ET Location: SoFi Stadium -- Inglewood, California TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free) \n Washington vs. Boise State prediction, pick \nThe Mountain West is 3-1 straight up in the LA Bowl, and Boise State is catching 9.5 points. Conventional wisdom says to take the Broncos against the spread. This is not, however, the same caliber of Boise State team that made the CFP a year ago. The Broncos scored just seven total points in four different games this season, including in their lone matchup with a Power Four team (a 28-7 loss to Notre Dame). Washington, on the other hand, made light work of all of its non-Big Ten opponents and scored at least 38 points in the process. The star trio of Demond Willliams Jr., Denzel Boston and Coleman should lead the Huskies to a win by double digits.

    "body": "\n        December football often means playing in the elements, and while we got a bit of a taste of that in Week 14 -- Josh Allen dashing through the snow in the Bills' thrilling win over the Bengals comes to mind -- we're going to feel mother nature's full impact in Week 15.A polar vortex from Canada will descend into the United States this weekend, creating frigid conditions in the midwest and, later, the east coast. Temperatures are expected to hover in the single digits in many areas, and that's without factoring in wind chill and other potential adverse conditions.\"This is the mother lode of cold air and is a term I don't use lightly,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 viewer's guide: Top 10 things to watch, including Super Bowl contenders and Philip Rivers comeback\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut the show will go on, at least for the NFL, and that means teams not only dealing with the teams across from them but whatever the weather may bring.\n(NOTE: All weather projections are via AccuWeather)Browns at Bears (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)CHICAGO, ILSunday weather: High of 11 degrees, feels like 1 degree, wind gusts up to 22 mphAlthough there's no snow in the forecast for Sunday, there could be some Friday flurries and more snow on Saturday, when the temperature plunges. Both of these teams are plenty used to playing in tough conditions considering the Browns faced the Titans in the snow and the Bears played a frigid game against the Packers just last week.Still, this is projected to be the coldest game Caleb Williams has played in as an NFL quarterback. Last week, he got off to a rough start against the Packers but played a much better second half. Still, expect Chicago to lean on the run as much as possible. Chicago leads the NFL in rushing success rate this season; Cleveland ranks 31st, so there will be a decided edge for the hosts.\nRavens at Bengals (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)CINCINNATI, OHSunday weather: High of 12 degrees, feels like 2 degrees, wind gusts up to 17 mphCincinnati is expected to get significant snow Friday and Saturday, but the storm should tail off before a critical AFC North game. Still, it will be a very cold day in the Queen City. Joe Burrow played well in his first snow game, completing 25 of 36 passes for 284 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions last week in Buffalo, though it should be noted that Tee Higgins -- who had a team-high 92 receiving yards and caught two touchdowns -- is in concussion protocol. Still, Burrow is 2-0 in games in which the kickoff temperature is 20 degrees or lower; that includes a 375-yard, three-touchdown game against the Patriots back in 2022.This will likely be the coldest game of Lamar Jackson's career. In fact, he has only played in one game under 20 degrees -- last year's playoff loss to the Bills, in which he played very well.\nChargers at Chiefs (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)KANSAS CITY, MOSunday weather: High of 23 degrees, feels like 23 degrees, wind gusts up to 10 mphThe conditions won't be quite as brutal in Kansas City, but the Chargers will certainly feel far from their sunny southern California home for several reasons. This will be their first game played in freezing-or-below temperatures since a 2019 playoff game at the Patriots. Philip Rivers was the starting quarterback (and he might be starting again this week for another team!) Antonio Gates was still in the NFL. The team was still more than a year away from drafting Justin Herbert.The Chiefs, on the other hand, are very used to the cold. Patrick Mahomes is 16-4 in games played at 32 degrees or colder, including a 12-2 mark at home games in those temperatures. They did, however, lose at home last week against the Texans.\nBills at Patriots (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)FOXBOROUGH, MASunday weather: High of 32 degrees, feels like 22 degrees, 1-3 inches of snow, wind gusts up to 21 mphAnother snow game for Josh Allen, trying to keep his team's AFC East hopes alive -- or at the very least not lose ground in the Wild Card chase? And he's facing Drake Maye, one of this season's biggest breakout star? Count me in.Josh Allen in six career snow games (incl. playoffs)Rank (since 2000)Wins51stTouchdowns accounted for141stTouchdowns scored61stRushing yards2942ndWhen Josh Allen's career wraps up, I hope they have a special section of highlights dedicated to just snow games.\nColts at Seahawks (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)SEATTLE, WASunday weather: High of 56 degrees, 80% chance of rainSeattle is dealing with a completely different weather issue: rain. Back-to-back atmospheric rivers have resulted in historic flooding in the Pacific Northwest. Washington governor Bob Ferguson declared a state of emergency Wednesday, and some areas of the state are under evacuation orders.The Seahawks have played in plenty of rain-drenched games. That's the nature of playing in Seattle. But the Colts, who call indoor Lucas Oil Stadium home, have played in just one game this season with \"rain\" listed as the kickoff temperature: last week's disastrous 36-19 loss to the Jaguars that saw Daniel Jones suffer a season-ending Achilles tear. With Anthony Richardson (eye) out and Riley Leonard suffering a knee injury after coming in following Jones' injury, he team signed 44-year-old Philip Rivers to its practice squad this week, and he could start. Whoever is behind center, he will be playing in brutal conditions against one of the league's best defenses.Dolphins at Steelers (Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET)PITTSBURGH, PAMonday weather: High of 22 degrees, feels like 12 degrees, wind gusts up to 18 mph, slight chance of precipitationThanks to years in Green Bay, Aaron Rodgers is plenty experienced in the cold.Tua Tagovailoa is, too, but he has struggled infamously in it when he has to leave Miami.Tua Tagovailoa under 40 degrees (incl. playoffs)W-L0-5TD6Turnovers6Team point diff-96Miami has made a recent run to get on the edges of playoff contention, but it will need Tagovailoa to reverse his cold-weather struggled to have a shot Monday.\n            ",

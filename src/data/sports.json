    "body": "\nTeams coming off wild-card comebacks will meet in the 2026 NFL divisional round as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Chicago Bears on Sunday. This matchup will complete the final four teams of the 2026 NFL playoffs. L.A. (12-5) defeated Carolina, 34-31, last Saturday via a game-winning touchdown pass with 38 seconds remaining. Chicago (11-6) overcame an 18-point deficit to knock off Green Bay, 31-27, on Saturday. The teams have split their prior two postseason meetings, with the home team winning each game.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Soldier Field in Chicago. The Bears prevailed, 24-18, in their last matchup back in 2024. Los Angeles is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Bears vs. Rams odds from DraftKings Sportsbook.

With that type of potency, no team has more against-the-spread victories than Los Angeles' 12 this season, while the Bears are just 2-7 ATS over their last nine divisional round playoff games. The L.A. offense sometimes overshadows the other side of the ball, which is elite in itself. No team has allowed fewer rushing scores than Los Angeles, which also finds itself in the top 10 in interceptions, sacks and passer rating allowed. That defense contrasts with what Chicago offers as the Bears rank 29th in total defense and allowed 6.0 yards per play in the regular season, which was the third-most in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bears can coverThe Windy City has certainly provided a home-field advantage for the Bears who are 8-2 both straight-up and ATS over their last 10 home games versus the Rams. This season, the team is 11-4-1 ATS over its last 16 games, while the Rams are the only team playing this weekend that lost versus the spread in the Wild Card Round. The Rams have lost against the line in three of their last four road games, and Chicago's highly efficient offense can exploit Los Angeles' suddenly leaky defense. No team has committed fewer turnovers than the Bears, who also possess top-10 rankings in both points scored and yards gained, while the Rams have given up an average of 30 points over their last five contests. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears     picksSportsLine's model has simulated Bears vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 52 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Rams vs. Bears, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

Saturday's intriguing matchup will pit NFC West rivals when Bock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers battle Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks.

This year, IU is 5-0 ATS versus ranked opponents, with each of those five coming against top-10 teams. On the field, Indiana is peerless, ranking second in the nation in both scoring offense and scoring defense, despite having the ninth-hardest strength of schedule. Heisman winner, and Miami native, Fernando Mendoza has more touchdown passes (8) than incompletions (5) during Indiana's CFP run, and he plays on the most disciplined team in college football. No team has a better turnover differential than the Hoosiers, who also average the fifth-fewest penalties per game in the country. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Miami can cover In addition to having home-field advantage, Miami also has a spread edge with Carson Beck under center. He's both won and covered in nine straight versus ranked foes, while the Hurricanes are on a 7-0 ATS run against Top 25 teams. Miami has a pair of future first-round draft picks on its D-line as the Canes average the fourth-most sacks per game in FBS. That pass rush is a strength which plays into what's Indiana's biggest weakness. Mendoza has been under pressure recently as he's been sacked an average of 2.5 times over his last six games, following only going down 0.8 times over his first nine games. On the other hand, Beck should have plenty of time in the pocket as Miami allows the lowest pressure rate in the nation. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Indiana picksSeverance has analyzed Indiana vs. Miami and is leaning Under on the total.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs begin their second stage with the divisional round taking place this weekend. Saturday's matchups you can make NFL picks on are Bills vs. Broncos (-1.5) and Seahawks vs. 49ers (+7), while Sunday's contests are Patriots vs. Texans (+3) and Rams vs. Bears (+4.5). New England has won eight straight divisional round games, while San Fran has won seven in a row, which are the two longest streaks in NFL history. So, should the Pats and Niners heavily factor into your NFL bets, player props or as part of a winning NFL parlay?Meanwhile, Denver is just a 1.5-point favorite despite having a bye and being the top seed. With the Bills dominating the Broncos to the tune of a 31-7 victory in last year's Wild Card round, Denver has several things to motivate it for Sunday's contest. How should that impact your divisional round NFL predictions? Before locking in any divisional round NFL picks or NFL prop bets, be sure to check out the divisional round NFL best bets and predictions from SportsLine's red-hot Vegas experts. SportsLine has more than 40 hand-picked Vegas experts who excel in multiple spots. The NFL, however, is a strength for the site as SportsLine currently has five total experts who are on NFL runs that have returned $1,000 or more for $100 players and one who has returned more than $1,500. Anybody following their NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, with the divisional round NFL schedule quickly approaching, SportsLine's top NFL experts are already locking in their picks. Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top divisional round NFL expert picks from Doug KralsteinBetter known as 'Prop Bet Guy,' Kralstein specializes in player props, and since joining SportsLine in 2024, he is up 112 units on his NFL player props. He enters the divisional round on another strong run, going 61-40 (+1475) on his past 101 NFL player props. This week, he is backing Bills receiver Khalil Shakir Over 4.5 receptions (-130) versus Denver on Saturday. \"Running most his routes out of the slot, he'll avoid Patrick Surtain on the outside. The Broncos allow the fifth-highest target rate to slot pass catchers (36%, per Fantasy Points). Denver allowed the third most catches to pass catchers in the slot and out wide for nine air yards or less (11.2 per game). Shakir's aDOT is 3.6 yards, with 82% of his targets coming in at less than 10 air yards.\" See all of Kralstein's picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop NFL picks from Alex SelesnickAnother prop-bet specialist, Selesnick, who is better known as PropStarz, has returned nearly 45 units since joining SportsLine. He enters this weekend on a 61-42 roll on NFL player props that has returned nearly $1,100 for $100 players. This week, PropStarz is going Under 57.5 receiving yards for Bears tight end Colston Loveland \"This is a huge number for Loveland, who has been very good inside of a crowded Bears pass catching group,\" PropStarz said. \"Loveland, however, has failed to eclipse 55 yards in 11/16 regular season games. Rome Odunze returned to Chicago's lineup last week, giving Caleb Williams numerous options. Loveland has gobbled up 38 targets in his last three games and that is not sustainable.

The Bills are 8-1 against the spread versus the Broncos over their last nine meetings, with three of those games taking place in Denver. Buffalo just defeated an elite defense in Jacksonville, which had the No. 1 run defense and forced the second-most turnovers. Thus, the Bills should find an easier time on the ground come Saturday, and Denver has the least opportunistic defense in the postseason. No 2026 playoff team forced fewer turnovers than the Broncos' 14, which is fewer than one per game. The Bills are undefeated (8-0) when they don't give away the ball and boast an 11-1 record with one or fewer turnovers. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverThis will be Buffalo's eight divisional road game since the 1970 merger, and the Bills have covered just once over that span. One also can't discount Denver coming off a bye, as the Broncos are 3-1-1 ATS over their last five with a rest advantage, while the Bills are 1-4 ATS this season when having less rest than their opponents. Denver possesses a ferocious pass rush as its 68 sacks are the fifth-most in NFL history, and the Bills have struggled when Josh Allen is under attack. The Broncos average four sacks per game, and Buffalo has lost six straight games, including being 0-3 this season, when Allen is sacked at least four times. Additionally, Sean Payton and company can exploit Buffalo's porous run defense as just four teams allowed more yards on the ground than Buffalo this season. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bills vs. Broncos   picksSportsLine's model has simulated Broncos vs. Bills 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 47 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in more than 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Bills vs. Broncos, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs continue on Saturday with a two-game divisional-round slate. The Buffalo Bills travel to take on the Denver Broncos (-1.5, 45.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, followed by San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (-7, 44.5) at 8 p.m. ET. Despite it being only a two-game slate, the NFL DFS player pool is still stacked with names like Josh Allen, James Cook, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Christian McCaffrey. Sam Darnold (oblique) is listed as questionable for Seattle, but told reporters he intends to play. The Niners will move forward without star tight end George Kittle, who tore his Achilles against the Eagles last week.Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Saturday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the divisional round on Saturday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Smith-Njigba as an anytime TD scorer (-110) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the NFL divisional round Saturday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for the divisional round on SaturdayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Saturday is McCaffrey. Arguably the most valuable all-around player in daily Fantasy football, McCaffrey, when healthy, has been a dominant force because of his ability to pile up stats as a runner and receiver. That continued on Wild Card Weekend when he piled up 114 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns against the Eagles. The Seahawks are stingy against opposing running backs, and they did a good job limiting McCaffrey in Week 18. He had 142 scrimmage yards against them in their first matchup, however, so there's plenty of evidence that he'll still be able to return value on the playoff slate. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet McCaffrey to go Over 50.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building around Bills quarterback Josh Allen. His passing stats have been down a bit this year largely due to struggles at wide receiver. He took matters into his own hands in the wild-card round, however, rushing 11 times, which tied his season high. He scored twice on the ground to add to his 273 yards and a score through the air. The Bills get a tough matchup against the Broncos, so you can expect Allen to use his feet again to move the ball. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Allen to go Over 37.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set divisional round Saturday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Saturday. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Saturday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fiorentina owner Rocco Commisso has died, the club announced on Saturday morning. Commisso, chairman of New York-based Mediacom Communications, was also a minority owner of the New York Cosmos and was one of the key figures who helped soccer grow over in the United States. Commisso was 76. He was born in Calabria, Italy, but his family moved to the United States when he was 12. He is survived by his wife, Catherine, and two children, Giuseppe and Marisa. Both Fiorentina and Mediacom announced his passing.\"After a prolonged period of medical treatment, our beloved president has left us, and today we all mourn his passing. His love for Fiorentina was the greatest gift he gave himself,\" Fiorentina said in a statement.\nFiorentina have also announced their game on Sunday against Bologna will take place. \"Fiorentina have decided, at the wish of the Commisso family and in order to honor the memory of their President, to take the field in all scheduled sporting commitments,\" while all the Serie A teams will dedicate a minute of silence before every match this weekend. \nGiuseppe Marotta, Inter president, spoke to DAZN ahead of the match against Udinese that took place on Saturday and said, \"He was one of the last great patrons, but he also had an entrepreneurial vision. He had important ideas, such as the Viola Park, and he wanted the stadium. He had tremendous passion, and I hope his family can continue his legacy.\"Who was Rocco Commisso?The Italian-American businessman was the chairman of Mediacom, one of the biggest cable television companies in the United States, and in the summer 2019, he acquired the majority of Fiorentina, one of the most iconic Italian teams, from the Della Valle family. In seven years, Fiorentina reached the UEFA Conference League final twice, began reconstruction work at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, and, most notably, built one of the most innovative training centers in Europe: Viola Park, named in his honor. \nSadly, in 2024, the club also lost its former general manager, Joe Barone. The Commisso-Barone leadership defined an era for Fiorentina and left a lasting mark on Italian football, and it will be deeply missed. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Los Angeles Rams head to the Windy City on Sunday for a date with the Chicago Bears, a franchise that the team has not had much success against for whatever reason, winning just 14 of 37 total matchups. The only time these franchises squared off in the postseason was one sided as the Bears dominated 23-0 in the 1985 NFC Championship Game en route to a Super Bowl victory. The Rams will hope for better results this time around when they visit the Bears at 6:30 p.m. ET in the Divisional Round at Soldier Field. Los Angeles is the fifth seed and is coming off a narrow win at Carolina in which the team needed a late touchdown to win after entering as double-digit favorites. Chicago, meanwhile, used more late-game magic to advance past Green Bay last weekend, scoring 25 points in the fourth quarter. Despite entering the postseason as a wild card team, the Rams have the second-shortest Super Bowl odds at DraftKings at +320, sitting only behind the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks, who have +270 odds to capture the Lombardi Trophy.The Rams are 4.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 48.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Los Angeles vs. Chicago in the Divisional Round.Here is a look at the Rams vs. Bears matchup from a betting perspective.Rams vs. Bears odds\nOpening spread: Rams -3.5 -- now Rams -4.5Opening money line: Rams -192, Bears +160 -- now Rams -198, Bears +164Opening total: 51.5 -- now 48.5The line has budged slightly here as the Rams opened as 3.5-point favorites but are now favored by 4.5 on the road. The total has also dipped from 51.5 at open to 48.5 entering the weekend. Los Angeles is now just the fourth team since 1970 to be a road favorite at least twice during one postseason run. On the flip side, Chicago is only the fourth team to be a home underdog twice in the same postseason, with two of the previous three making the Super Bowl -- the 2008 Cardinals and 2017 Eagles, the latter of which won the big game. Chicago also will become one of only five teams to be a home underdog in the Divisional Round over the last 40 years.Rams betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 13-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 12-6 (including playoffs)O/U record: 11-7 (including playoffs)The Rams were double-digit favorites against the Panthers in the Wild Card Round but didn't come close to covering, although they owned 14- and 10-point leads in the second quarter. However, all but one of their regular-season victories were by five or more points, including each of their five triumphs away from home.Los Angeles has covered the spread in two-thirds of its Divisional Round games since 1970, going 12-6. Last year, the Rams were seven-point underdogs against the Eagles and managed to cover as Stafford and Parkinson hooked up for a touchdown with less than three minutes to play in the fourth quarter of Philadelphia's 28-22 victory.Stafford, who is expected by many to win the 2025 MVP Award as he led the NFL in passing yards (4,707) and touchdown tosses (46), can match Aaron Rodgers' league record by throwing at least two TD passes in his ninth consecutive playoff game. The 37-year-old, who enters with a postseason-record four straight 300-yard passing performances on the road, also is one scoring pass away from joining Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as the only quarterbacks with two seasons in which they had a total of at least 50 regular-season and playoff touchdown tosses.Bears betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 12-6 (including playoffs)ATS record: 10-7-1 (including playoffs)O/U record: 9-9 (including playoffs)A cover by the Bears wasn't looking good last weekend as they trailed Green Bay 21-3 at halftime and were down 27-16 with just over 6 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter. But Caleb Williams connected with Olamide Zaccheaus for a touchdown and Colston Loveland on the ensuing two-point attempt with 4:18 remaining before throwing a 25-yard scoring pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 to play.Chicago hasn't done well against the spread in the Divisional Round since winning Super Bowl XX, going just 2-7. However, the club has had success against Los Angeles at home of late, covering in eight of their last 10 meetings at Soldier Field.Williams got off to a rough start in his postseason debut as he threw a pair of interceptions without guiding the Bears to a touchdown over the first three quarters against the Packers. But he finished with 361 passing yards and two TD tosses and can match the franchise record of seven consecutive games -- including playoffs -- with multiple scoring passes set in 1995 by Erik Kramer. Williams also can join Sid Luckman (two in 1941), Jim McMahon (three in 1985) and Rex Grossman (two in 2006) as the only QBs in Bears history to win multiple games in one postseason.Both teams are in good shape health-wise, though second-year Chicago receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with the same foot injury that caused him to miss considerable time in the later stages of the regular season. Rams-Bears prop pick: Puka Nacua anytime TD scorer (-115)\nNacua found the end zone in nine of his 16 games during the regular season, including four of the final five. The 24-year-old wideout, who was the NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice in 2025, proved to be a double threat last week against the Panthers as he had a 14-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter and a 5-yard TD run in the second. It was the second rushing score of the campaign for Nacua, who has amassed eight touchdowns over his last six outings. The Bears allowed four different Green Bay receivers to score in their wild card win, so it doesn't seem likely that they'll be able to keep Nacua from doing so.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At the start of this season, Pep Guardiola did what any other manager would probably have done in his situation. He assessed his squad, now shorn of Kevin De Bruyne, and concluded there was only one appropriate plan for the attack. This year would be Erling Haaland: To The Max.A shining star in the center of the opposition penalty area, 10 orbiting bodies who must make sacrifices to satiate the deity. And the signs were that this was really working. Haaland was as good as he has ever been, an elemental force of scoring, the sheer weight of his gravity dragging Arsenal back into a title race.There was always, though, a nagging fear. What happened if the light from the Haaland star faded? Over the last month, Manchester City have found out. One goal, a penalty against Brighton, from the big guy, no league win in 2026 and a title challenge that is in very real danger of falling apart before spring. It has been a five game run where Haaland has not looked like a top two footballer on the planet -- maybe best, your mileage on Kylian Mbappe may vary -- and it might be enough to end hopes of catching Arsenal atop the Premier League table.If Arsenal beat Nottingham Forest then City will find themselves closer to Manchester United, who obliterated their chaotic rearguard en route to a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford this afternoon, than the leaders.\nExpected goals progress during Manchester United's 2-0 win over Manchester City \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Though Michael Carrick deserves huge credit for the fashion in which United attacked the day, they were only careening into holes that had been apparent in the City rearguard all season long. Expanded in the absence of Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias no doubt, but this has been the year of Guardiola dicing with danger defensively. He knew the opposition might score two. He seemed to trust that Haaland would get three.Not today. Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez attacked the No.9 with ferocity. The 14 touches he had is not wildly out of the normal for Haaland, but so many of them seemed to be with his back to goal and a United center back smacking him on the shoulder. Two shooting chances around the 55th minute never even got to Senne Lammens, Maguire and Martinez hurling themselves in the direction of danger.This was not a day where Haaland's mere presence could shift a defense out of shape either, creating space for Phil Foden or Antoine Semenyo to let fly from. United's banks of four plugged every gap, shutting down avenues for the sort of crosses that might have allowed Haaland to drift to the back post too. With Rayan Cherki on the bench for the first half, there was no one who could create something out of nothing in Kevin De Bruyne fashion. The ball cycled around the attacking third but no one was able to force a shooting chance for the big guy.\nHaaland's exit with 80 minutes played looked an admission of defeat from Guardiola, all the more so given his place was taken by 18-year-old, yet to score a senior goal, Divine Mukasa. It looked like Haaland needed a break. No wonder. Only five outfield players have more minutes under the belt across all competitions this season (one of them is his soon to be team mate Marc Guehi). The 2478 minutes he has logged is a full four hours more than any of his teammates. Haaland's exploits might appear to be super human but until there is any compelling medical evidence to the contrary, we must conclude he is just a man. Perhaps a tired one at that.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            That might be the easiest explanation for why his output has waned of late. Since Christmas he has one goal, a penalty against Brighton. His shots per 90 minutes across all competitions have dipped from 4.21 to 3.29, his non-penalty xG cratering from 0.89 to 0.3. It used to be that Haaland would rarely if ever take a shot from outside the box. Now a full 30 percent of them are coming from range.None of this necessarily tells you much other than Haaland being out of form. The most convincing explanation for this cold streak is not that defenders have figured him out, that his team mates aren't clicking with him or anything else so dramatic. What is happening to him is just what happens to every single footballer, a bad run of form, in this case probably because he needs a break. Most teams would take this level of production from their center forward at any time.\nCity, however, aren't most teams. They have geared themselves towards Haaland in the sort of fashion you usually associate with a relegation battler. Not Andy Johnson's Crystal Palace. A much better version of Andy Johnson's Crystal Palace. And as Haaland has struggled so has his team. At just the moment when they would usually begin their endgame push, they have faltered.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            They have not solved many of the issues that have lurked in the background for several years before crashing into the forefront 15 or so months ago. The defense was too reliant on the fitness of key individuals and right now none of Dias, Gvardiol or prime Rodri are coming around the corner to tighten things up. Guehi will only be able to do so much. Even if you flanked him with the big three defenders it would do little to address the issue of how easily opponents play through City in their own half of the pitch. A team as young as Guardiola's should have had a bit more energy to chase down Maguire and Casemiro.These are the sort of problems that Guardiola has coached his way out of before and might do again. He has earned the benefit of the doubt. After all, for so much of this season it looked like his latest gambit, to hand the keys to the team over to Haaland, might pay off in spectacular fashion for a team few expected to really to compete for first place this year.\nThen again Guardiola must have known this might happen at some stage. If you live by Haaland's goalscoring exploits, you might just die by them too. And today, City looked dead on their feet.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe NFL Playoffs are down to just eight teams after Wild Card Weekend, and the Divisional Round will decide which four teams will be competing for a Super Bowl berth during next week's conference championship games. The Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks are back in action after enjoying first-round byes last week thanks to securing the No. 1 seed in their respective conferences. Denver hosts the Buffalo Bills to kick off the Divisional Round Saturday afternoon while the Seahawks face off with the San Francisco 49ers for the third time this season Saturday night. Sunday sees the Houston Texans visiting the New England Patriots in a battle of two of the hotter teams in the league, and the weekend concludes with the Chicago Bears hosting the Los Angeles Rams after both teams survived close games last week. Parlays are always a popular bet type for NFL betting, but with just four games on the docket, putting a money line parlay together can be tough. SportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman has crafted one for the Divisional Round, and he explains his picks here.NFL three-team money line parlay strategyBetting parlays during the NFL playoffs feels like a completely different game than the regular season. Oddsmakers tighten things up, every team is throwing their best punch and the pressure can make even the most reliable squads act out of character.Just look at Wild Card Weekend: Favorites split straight up and went 2-4 against the spread. All regular season long, favorites cashed just 66.5% of the time, which is a pretty big drop-off from last year's 71.8% mark. Now, with the Divisional Round here, I'm rolling out a three-team money line parlay based on the picks I trust most.NFL Divisional Playoffs money line favorites parlay\nSeattle Seahawks over San Francisco 49ers\nAfter the 49ers' hard-fought Wild Card win in Philly and Seattle's first-round bye, these NFC West rivals get another shot at each other. Both teams have won once on the other's field, but San Francisco's road win came when the team was much healthier. The Seahawks roll into the playoffs with a seven-game win streak, and, honestly, there's nowhere they'd rather play than Lumen Field. That place is deafening -- if you've ever been, you know. And when it's the playoffs, it's on a whole different level.The 49ers are coming off a bruising win in Philly and now have to fly back across the country for a Saturday night game. That kind of travel wears on a team, especially with only a few days to recover. Seattle, meanwhile, is rested and waiting. Mike Macdonald knows how to make life hard for Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey -- just look at what happened last time. Holding a Kyle Shanahan offense to three points and under 180 yards isn't luck; Seattle just matches up really well. Additionally, the Seahawks' special teams rank second in DVOA with an elite kicker (Jason Myers: 28-33 FG this season).I just really love Seattle's stop unit, and the proof is in the pudding. The Seahawks possess a historically elite pass defense, ranking first in yards per pass allowed at 6.0 (vs. 49ers' 6.9). More critically, they rank first in third down defense conversion at 32.0% (vs. 49ers allowing 39.4%), and first in run defense at 3.7 yards per carry (vs. 49ers' 4.3). The Seahawks' overall defensive DVOA of -24.2% ranks first in the NFL, creating a defensive advantage that compounds against an injured 49ers squad missing several key players, including their emotional leader, George Kittle. The biggest question this game comes with the news that Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is questionable with an oblique injury he suffered during Thursday's practice. Darnold and Macdonald have both said he is going to play, though an ESPN report Saturday morning states that Darnold hasn't thrown a football since the injury, which could limit his effectiveness against a familiar foe.My model loves the Seahawks in this spot, with a spread near -10 or a money line close to -475. I've got a lot of respect for the 49ers' coaching staff -- they always have their team ready. But with how Seattle is playing right now, I can't pass up the Seahawks at this number.New England Patriots over Houston Texans\nLet's call it what it was: the Texans beat the Steelers on Monday night because Pittsburgh's offense was a mess. Arthur Smith's play-calling was unimaginative -- no motion, no screens, barely any misdirection, and not even a draw play to slow down Houston's relentless pass rush. The Texans' defense deserves credit, but the Steelers made it way too easy. You'd think they'd try something creative to help Jaylen Warren break through, but there was nothing.Switching gears, that kind of collapse isn't happening to Drake Maye. He's leading the league in QBR at 77.1, and he's shown time and again that he can handle pressure late in games. Plus, the Patriots' coaching staff is among the best at making in-game adjustments -- they won't fall into the same traps as Pittsburgh. Expect New England to come in with a focused, well-crafted plan to challenge this Texans defense, which has been outstanding all season.The Texans are playing their second consecutive road playoff game after a physical Monday night win in Pittsburgh. Short rest, travel and a shift from the AFC North to the biting cold of New England put them at a significant physiological disadvantage compared to the Patriots' defense, which was on the field for only 59 plays in their win over the Chargers. Houston's offensive line finished the season ranked 30th in pass-block win rate. While C.J. Stroud is elusive, he cannot scramble forever. The Patriots' front seven, which has been the engine of this 14-win team, should be able to consistently collapse the pocket, forcing Stroud into hurried throws or sacks.The Texans' limited offense is even more limited this weekend now that star WR Nico Collins has been ruled out with a concussion, taking Stroud's best and most proven option away. The receiving room consists of younger players and rookies, and they'll need to step up in order for Houston to have a chance in New England, especially as Stroud has struggled in freezing conditions, with five fumbles (two of which were lost). The Texans are a talented young team, but they are walking into a buzzsaw. I think the Patriots' offense will do just enough to get the victory.Los Angeles Rams over Chicago Bears\nHere's a data point that not many people are talking about: The Bears and Packers beat the heck out of each other in that Wild Card game. Between them, they ran 147 plays -- 77 for Chicago and 70 for Green Bay. Most NFL games don't even come close to that, usually landing somewhere around 120 or 130. Defenses were hustling nonstop, and the offenses were battling for every yard, just trying to make something happen. The Bears' defense had its hands full chasing Jordan Love all night, and the offense was digging out of a big hole. All that effort, both physical and mental, is tough to shake off -- especially this late in the season. The Rams? They played a close one against Carolina, but it wasn't nearly as draining or emotional as what went down in Chicago.Jared Verse and Byron Young have been a problem for offenses all year. The Rams' young edge rushers play with a ton of energy and have a knack for getting into the backfield. After last week's marathon game, you have to wonder if the Bears' offensive line will have enough left in the tank to keep up. If Chicago falls behind early, Verse and Young can turn it up even more, and the Bears could be in real trouble.The Rams possess one of the most efficient offenses in NFL history. Their 31.2% DVOA ranks first in the league, while Matthew Stafford's elite passer rating of 109.2 will take advantage of Chicago's poor pass defense (7.2 yards per attempt allowed, 28th in the NFL). The Bears' defensive DVOA sits at 25th, creating a structural mismatch. Stafford has been lights-out in the red zone, turning 64.2% of those chances into touchdowns. On top of that, the Rams are 11 spots better than the Bears in opponent passer rating, which just adds to the mismatch.The Bears have struggled to stop the run all season, giving up 5 yards a carry -- near the bottom of the league. The Rams are averaging 4.6 yards per run. With the weather expected to be freezing, that running game could be a huge difference-maker. When it gets cold, it's all about which team can run the ball. The Rams have the advantage there, no question. As for the Bears, they live and die by chaos -- big plays, turnovers, wild momentum swings. Sure, they forced a ton of takeaways this year, but their defense still gave up plenty of points (23rd). The Rams own the 10th-ranked scoring defense. I'm taking the Rams to win this one. They've handled a much tougher schedule -- second-hardest in the league compared to Chicago's 21st -- and that experience really counts in the Divisional Round.\n            ",

He's coming into the divisional round on a 28-11-2 roll (+1580) on his last 41 NFL picks. Now, he's set his sights on this playoff showdown between Buffalo and Denver, and has come away with an official play for this matchup. We can tell you he's leaning Under the 46 point total, but to see his official ATS pick for this game you'll need to go to SportsLine. Bills -1.5: \"If the Broncos have one advantage this week, it's the fact that they're coming off a bye while the Bills will be coming off a short week after playing on Sunday in the wild card round. Not only are the Bills on a short week, but they have to deal with the mile high air. It's not an easy adjustment and it's a big reason why the Broncos have won four straight home playoff games. Also, Sean Payton has NEVER lost a playoff game coming off a bye (4-0). He's the new Andy Reid. The only thing standing between the Broncos and their first AFC title berth in 10 years is Josh Allen, but unfortunately for Denver, that's a big obstacle. In the wild card round, Allen led his first career game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game, and now, I'll say he takes one step closer to getting to his first career Super Bowl.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer John Breech on why he has Buffalo pulling out the 23-20 win over Denver.

The Seahawks beat the 49ers in the regular-season finale to lock up the top seed. That game was won by their defense. But left tackle Trent Williams didn't play in that one for the 49ers. That matters. I think Brock Purdy will keep the 49ers in this one, but the Seahawks will find a way to pull it out to advance to the NFC Championship.\" -- CBS Sports Senior NFL analyst Pete Prisco on why he has Seattle edging out the Niners, 24-20.

In a mucky game against the Chargers, the defense rolled, pressuring Justin Herbert effectively every time he dropped back and sacked him six times. So, the Patriots are capable of pressuring Stroud in a similar way he was last week, which opens the door for more turnovers.

    "body": "\n        Twenty-four of college basketball's 25 ranked teams are in action Saturday. And sixteen of those teams are playing on the road. So as someone who has followed this sport closely for decades, let me translate: the forecast over the next 24 hours in the sport has a high probability of chaos.   Just in the last week alone, we've seen three undefeated teams take their first loss of the season, and during that span 16 ranked teams suffered at least one loss. Chances of more mayhem continue into the weekend with the top six teams in the latest AP Top 225 poll all on the road Saturday. Of the top 20 teams in the AP poll, 16 are playing away from home.  \n        \n            \n                College Basketball Power Rankings: Duke, Nebraska, BYU jump up; Michigan, Vanderbilt fall after first loss\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWe could be in for a fun and frenzied weekend in the sport as a result. So I called in the experts to help me make picks for some of the biggest games on tap for Saturday. Those picks straight-up and against the spread are below.  Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET     No. 5 Purdue at USC    \n6 p.m. on Peacock: Let's take a stab and go with an upset pick here, huh? USC has been hot and cold much of the last couple weeks. But it has largely found a way to play up to its competition at home. Eric Musselman will have his guys ready for this one given how dominant Purdue has been this season. A win here would do wonders for the Trojans.

But I'm not biting. Duke and UNC are within an hour of each other geographically but they're lightyears apart on the court right now.

They are 7-1 as home favorites this season and this sets up for a nice bounceback spot coming off a close loss Sunday at Washington. Pick: OSU -3.5 -- Boone  \n  \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            OSU -3.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n        No. 19 Florida at No. 10 Vanderbilt    \n2 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Vandy has lost some of its shine after suffering its first loss of the season midweek at Texas. But I'm not jumping off the bandwagon. They get Florida in Nashville in an ideal rebound spot vs. a Florida team that has largely underwhelmed this season. This one could be close, as the spread indicates, but the Commodores get back in the win column. Pick: Vandy -3.5 -- Boone            \t \t  \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            VANDY -3.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    \n            ",

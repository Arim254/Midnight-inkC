The effort he made the other day, like that of his teammates, was tremendous and speaks volumes about a player with a winning mentality and who has everything that a Real Madrid player needs. Considering his young age and experience I'm delighted with him and above all with his mentality, effort and the leadership he has with his teammates.

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE --The Giannis Antetokounmpo saga took another twist Friday when the two-time MVP left the Milwaukee Bucks' 102-100 loss to the Denver Nuggets with 34 seconds remaining due to a right calf injury. Antetokounmpo will undergo an MRI Saturday and said that he expects to miss four to six weeks, which would keep him out until after the Feb. 5 trade deadline. An official timeline will be determined after he undergoes imaging. \"I was feeling it the majority of the game, but did not want to stop playing. But at the end I could not move. I had to stop,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"For me to stop playing and not be able to move, it was extremely painful.\"Antetokounmpo missed over three weeks in December with a right soleus (calf muscle) strain, and was still on a minutes restriction for Friday's contest. It's unclear exactly when Antetokounmpo re-aggravated the injury, but he lacked his usual explosiveness throughout the night. Despite being limited physically, he finished with 22 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists on 4 of 8 from the field and 14 of 16 from the free throw line. The Bucks fell behind by as many as 23 early in the fourth quarter, but staged a furious comeback to cut the deficit to one in the final seconds. Antetokounmpo checked out with 34 seconds remaining, however, and did not return. \n\"I didn't like what my eyes were seeing, personally,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \"Giannis was defiant about staying in. On that one play you could see him trying to run down the floor, I had had enough. I didn't ask, I just took him out. He actually wanted to go back in. That was a no for me.\"Antetokounmpo has a history of calf injuries. In addition to the right calf strain that kept him out for three weeks earlier this season, he missed over two weeks (and sat out of the All-Star Game) last season due to a left calf strain. In addition, a left calf strain kept him out of the final week of the regular season and the playoffs in 2024. \"I don't think it looks great, personally,\" Rivers said of Antetokounmpo's latest injury. \"This calf keeps coming up and it's concerning. I'm not a doctor, but I'm smart enough to know that his calf keeps bothering him and there's something that is there and it keeps happening, and that's troublesome for all of us.\"\nAntetokounmpo was visibly frustrated at his locker after the game. \"Probably the next steps will be go to MRI tomorrow, after the MRI they will tell me probably I popped something in my calf, or my soleus, something. They'll probably give me a protocol of four to six weeks that I'll be out. This is from my experience being around in the NBA,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"After that, I'm going to work my butt off to come back. That will probably be the end of February, beginning of March. Hopefully the team will be in a place that we can at least make the Play-In or the playoffs. Just take it day-by-day, try to get better.\"It remains to be seen how long Antetokounmpo will be sidelined, but an extended absence would be a major blow. Friday's defeat was the sixth in the last eight games for the Bucks, who are now a season-worst eight games under .500. At 18-26, they are in 11th place in the Eastern Conference and 2.5 games behind the Atlanta Hawks for the final Play-In Tournament spot. The Bucks do not control their first-round pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, but they will receive the least favorable of their pick and the New Orleans Pelicans' pick. The Pelicans have the second-worst record in the league, which means it is possible for the Bucks to get a lottery selection. \n\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors: Bucks' conversations with star player have 'intensified,' per report\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAn extended absence for Antetokounmpo would not only affect the Bucks' playoff chances, but throw a major wrench into the trade deadline plans for the Bucks and numerous other teams. There has been plenty of speculation about Antetokounmpo's future ahead of the Feb. 5 deadline, and Brian Windhorst reported earlier this week that \"Giannis is the trade deadline ... The entire league is watching Giannis.\"\n            ",

Umanmielen played last season for Kiffin at Ole Miss.Seaton, a former five-star recruit in the 2024 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, committed to coach Deion Sanders out of high school. During his freshman campaign, Seaton started all 13 games and became the first offensive tackle to start in a season-opener at the school.\n\nAs a sophomore, Seaton appeared in nine games during the 2025 season but missed the final three due to injury. He earned All-Big 12 Second Team honors for his efforts.\nLSU under Kiffin holds the No. 1 overall transfer class in the 247Sports rankings.

Krylov (30-11) is No. 13 in light heavyweight rankings, while Bukauskas (19-6) is unranked. The former has advantages over his opponent in a number of metrics, including significant strikes landed per minute, significant strikes accuracy and takedowns average. Bukauskas also lacks a diversified attack as just one of his last 17 bouts have seen him win via submission, while Krylov has over a dozen MMA wins via both submission and with a knockout.\"[Krylov] seems very focused in this training camp and is still only 33 years old,\" Vithlani told SportsLine. \"If Krylov can find his old form, his MMA game will be a lot more diverse than Bukauskas. If Krylov can mix in his grappling, he will threaten with chokes and ground and pound to win this fight.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett picksVithlani has strong picks for Gaethje vs. Pimblett and other bouts on the UFC 324 card.

    "body": "\n        \r\n\tSan Diego State will be looking to get back on track Saturday, when it travels to UNLV for a clash between a pair of the Mountain West's top teams on CBS. The Aztecs (15-5, 7-1) remain alone atop the conference standings after falling at Grand Canyon on Wednesday, but the loss inflicted some damage to the Aztecs' at-large aspirations for the NCAA Tournament. \r\n\r\n\r\nBeating the Runnin' Rebels (10-8, 5-2) would help get the repair started. UNLV enters on a three-game winning streak that includes a massive 86-76 win over Utah State on Tuesday night. That was a head-turning result in the Mountain West which proved once again just how dangerous UNLV is under first-year coach Josh Pastner. \r\n\r\n\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: No. 2 seeds Houston, UConn, Purdue, Iowa State ready to move up if teams on top line go down\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\r\nWhile his debut campaign has featured a few bad losses, the Rebels also own victories over Memphis and Stanford. UNLV atones for being one of the nation's worst 3-point shooting teams by relentlessly attacking the basket and shooting 26.6 free throws per game, which ranks No. 13 nationally. \r\n\r\n\r\nSan Diego State counters with its vintage strong defense and a balanced offensive attack. Looming large for SDSU is uncertainty around the status of center Magoon Gwath. The seven-footer missed the Grand Canyon amid a hip issue, and his status will be a key issue for the Aztecs both in this game and beyond. \r\n\n\r\n  Where to watch San Diego State vs. UNLV live   \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDate: Saturday, January 24 | Time: 4 p.m. ET\r\n Location: Thomas & Mack Center -- Las Vegas\r\n TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App \r\n\n\tStreaming on Paramount+ PremiumLive stream: fubo (Try for free)\r\n\r\n San Diego State vs. UNLV: Need to know \r\n\r\n\r\n\tInside the arc: If you're a fan of the 3-pointer, this isn't the game for you. UNLV and San Diego State rank 285th and 310th, respectively, in 3-point attempts per game. The Runnin' Rebels make just 31.4% of their attempts and have hit more than 10 in a game just once this season. SDSU makes a highly respectable 36.7% of its 3-pointers but is coming off a 3 for 18 performance from deep in Wednesday's loss at Grand Canyon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMountain West menace: UNLV guard Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn is emerging as one of the Mountain West's most potent scorers. The Illinois transfer finished with 21 points on 8 of 12 shooting in the Runnin' Rebels' 86-76 win at Utah State on Tuesday. That followed a 33-point outburst in a win over Boise State on Jan. 13. Against league foes he is averaging 18.1 points, and he's reached double figures in all but one game this season. Gibbs-Lawhorn has some variety in his arsenal as he inflicts damage as both a spot-up shooter and ball-handler. At just 6-foot-1, he's also been solid at the rim. \r\n\n\r\n\tSan Diego State's resume: San Diego State enters on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble in CBS Sports Bracketology and is expected to stay there even with a win. However, our long-term forecast projects the Aztecs to ultimately make the bracket as a No. 11 seed. For now, SDSU's resume is a bit chaotic and dragged down by a Quad 3 November home loss to Troy. While the Aztecs do own a Quad 1 road win over Nevada from Jan. 6, they'll need to add more in order to finish on the right side of the bubble. The most significant opportunities still ahead are road games against Utah State (Jan. 31) and New Mexico (Feb. 28).  \r\n\r\n\r\n San Diego State vs. UNLV prediction, picks \r\n\n\r\nSan Diego State plays a style of defense designed to tempt you into shooting 3-pointers. That could be a problem for UNLV, which does not take or make many shots from beyond the arc. The Runnin' Rebels prefer to attack, get fouled and shoot free throws. Provided the Aztecs make enough shots of their own and prevent UNLV from running in transition, they should be able to dictate the game's flow on the defensive end. SDSU is also going to be motivated to seek redemption following a deflating 1-point loss at Grand Canyon on Wednesday night that ended its perfect start to Mountain West play. Pick: San Diego State -5.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSDSU -5.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UNLV\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UNLV\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \r\n\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The second leg of a Saturday tripleheader on CBS will feature a matchup between No. 1 Arizona and West Virginia. The Wildcats head into the weekend as one of three teams in Division I basketball that have yet to suffer a loss. The Wildcats have held the top spot in the AP Top 25 poll for seven consecutive weeks. Arizona is coming off a 77-51 win over Cincinnati to improve to 19-0 overall and 6-0 in Big 12 play. Arizona and Houston (5-0) are the only teams in the conference that have yet to suffer a loss. The Wildcats only face the Cougars once this season (Feb. 21) on the road. West Virginia improved to 13-6 with a 75-63 win over Arizona State. The Mountaineers have won four of their last five games, which includes a win at home over Kansas. This weekend will mark the fourth Top 25 opponent WVU has played this season. West Virginia is 1-2 thus far, with losses coming against Iowa State and Houston. Here is everything you need to know ahead of the Big 12 showdown.   Where to watch Arizona vs. West Virginia live   Date: Saturday, Jan. 24 | Time: 2 p.m. ET Location: McKale Memorial Center -- Tucson, Arizona \nTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Arizona vs. West Virginia: Need to know Arizona's dynamic duo: The Wildcats have the luxury of having not one, but two of the best first-year players in the sport. That would be Koa Peat and Brayden Burries. Peat has one of the best debuts in college basketball history against reigning national champion Florida earlier this season when he scored 30 points. Peat has started all 19 games for the Wildcats. As for Burries, he has played well the last two months after a slow start. He is averaging 14.2 points and 4.4 rebounds and has been a major reason why the Wildcats still have yet to suffer a loss. His best showing came against Kansas State earlier this month when he finished with 28 points and nine rebounds. Big opportunity for WVU: The Mountaineers have a chance to shake up college basketball this weekend with a win. However, recent history suggests WVU hasn't performed well against ranked teams. WVU has lost five consecutive games (including 16 of 17) on the road against a ranked opponent. The last win against a ranked team on the road came against Kansas on Dec. 31, 2024. The Mountaineers are 1-6 away from home and are averaging just 67.3 points per game in that stretch. \nArizona coach Tommy Lloyd has fueled a historic start: Arizona is on the verge of its best start to the season in 12 years. During the 2013-14 campaign, the Wildcats got off to a 21-0 start. Currently, Arizona is riding a 19-game win streak, which is the third-longest active streak in the sport. With a win this weekend, Arizona can clinch another 20-win season under Lloyd. That would mark the fifth consecutive 20-win season under his watch. No other Arizona coach has started his tenure with more seasons with at least 20 wins. Of course, the Wildcats have much loftier goals, but Lloyd has been one of the best and most consistent coaches in the sport since arriving from Gonzaga.  Arizona vs. West Virginia prediction, picks \nWest Virginia has played well since the calendar flipped to 2026. Outside of losing to Iowa State and Houston -- two of the best teams in the nation -- WVU has shown improvement. I think the Mountaineers keep this game within 10 in the second half and cover the spread. If WVU can slow down Arizona's lethal offense that ranks No. 7 in scoring (89.9 points per game), it will have a chance to make it interesting. Pick: West Virginia +17.5 \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            ARIZ -17.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            West Virginia\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            West Virginia\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Patience has become a virtue for Michigan State. The No. 10-ranked Spartans are in the thick of another Big Ten Title race on the backs of elite player development. Senior forward Jaxon Kohler has transformed into an All-Conference-caliber big man and is playing the best basketball of his life. Redshirt-sophomore point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. and senior center Carson Cooper are also massive player-development wins for Tom Izzo. Kohler, Fears and Cooper are at the epicenter of Michigan State's glitzy 17-2 record, including a 7-1 mark in Big Ten play. Michigan State is fresh off a 2-0 West Coast roadtrip, but that body-clock adjustment is always a concern for coaches. Four days should be enough to get back up to speed, but it's a factor entering Saturday's action.  If Michigan State wants to put another Big Ten Championship banner on the board, it has to avoid a letdown against a wounded, undermanned Maryland squad. The Terps (8-11, 1-7 in Big Ten play) will still not have star big man Pharrel Payne, who is still on the mend after a gruesome knee injury suffered against Michigan last month. Payne is not expected to play this season, but the brutal Big Ten bouts keep coming for first-year Maryland coach Buzz Williams.  Where to watch Michigan State vs. Maryland live Date: Saturday, Jan. 24 | Time: 12 p.m. ET Location: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, Michigan TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Michigan State vs. Maryland: Need to knows Jeremy Fears Jr. versus Diggy Coit: Coit has been one of the top isolation scorers in the country, and he dropped 43 (!) points on Penn State last Sunday. The 5-foot-11 assassin has the speed and craftiness to get to his pull-up jumper whenever he wants, but Michigan State's team defense is excellent. The Spartans load up the gaps and limit driving lines as well as any team in the league, but this is also another opportunity for Jeremy Fears Jr. to add to his Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year resume.  \nHow will Michigan State navigate the Terps' zone? Maryland has been playing a lot of zone lately. The results haven't been great, but Williams might not have much of a choice in this matchup. Oregon and Duke have used zone defense to gum up the game and frustrate this Michigan State halfcourt offense. Maryland's zone defense isn't that good, but it does coax a trey at a 58% clip. Michigan State has a couple capable shooters, but that's not the name of the game for the Spartans, especially when Coen Carr, Jeremy Fears Jr. and Carson Cooper are on the floor together. Michigan State has to find better solutions against zone defenses, but I could easily see Fears still getting into the teeth of the defense and that's when Michigan State gets so scary. Maryland's transition defense will be strained: Relentless offensive rebounding is a tenet of Buzz Ball. Maryland will send four to the offensive glass at times, but that leaves its transition defense in some bad spots. Michigan State is an elite rebounding team and equally as dominant in transition. Maryland cannot be reckless, or we will have a Flying Carr sighting at the Breslin.  \n Michigan State vs. Maryland prediction, picks You aren't going to out-physical Michigan State, but Maryland certainly will try. Even without Pharrel Payne, Maryland has the athletes to match Michigan State's frontcourt thumpers. Solomon Washington and Elijah Saunders are weight-room warriors who will not be overwhelmed by Michigan State's awesome frontcourt duo of Jaxon Kohler and Carson Cooper. Michigan State has schematic edges all over the place because Maryland's offense goes haywire when Coit isn't Coit-ing, but the Terps have the athleticism to not get totally abused on the glass and stay inside this hefty spread. Pick: Maryland +18.5 \n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -18.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The upcoming week will be crucial for Napoli as the team coached by Antonio Conte will face Juventus on Sunday before meeting Chelsea next Wednesday for one last crucial Champions League's game that will determine whether or not Napoli will be eliminated from the most important European tournament. The Azzurri are currently in 25th place, the first team eliminated, but the tie against the English team could dramatically change their position in the standings. Before that, Juventus will host Napoli on Sunday at the Allianz Stadium for another key match for the Scudetto and Champions League race. This is why the upcoming two matches will probably also define the future of Napoli manager Conte, who will face two of his former teams. Juventus, where he was a player, team captain and then manager from 2011 to 2014 and then Chelsea, where he won a Premier League title and coached the Blues from 2016 to 2018. Here's what you need to know ahead of a key week for Napoli: How to watch Juventus vs. Napoli, oddsDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Allianz Stadium -- Turin Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Juventus +104; Draw +208; Napoli +291A difficult European campaign \n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Napoli's season has been deeply affected by injuries as Conte has had to face much of the season with some major absences to huge stars like Romelu Lukaku and Kevin de Bruyne, while other key players like Frank Anguissa or Alessandro Buongiorno also had injuries that forced them to not play regularly so far. Those absences have definitely been the biggest factor in any Napoli struggles so far this season, as Conte's team come from the 2024-25 Scudetto win in his first season at the club. We knew Napoli could have some issues with more games to play but injuries didn't help Conte to rotate his roster as much as he wished before the start of the new spell. While Napoli's performances were acceptable in the Italian Serie A, things got more difficult when Napoli had to play in the Champions League. With only two wins in seven games and three defeats including a 6-2 away loss to PSV, one of the most worrying performances of the season, Napoli are now seriously risking elimination in the league phase, and even a draw in the last home match against Chelsea on January 28 may not be enough. \n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Conte showed his frustration for some of the choices made by Napoli in the summer, including the signings of Noa Lang from PSV and Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese. As a matter of fact both players are now on the verge of leaving the Azzurri, with Lang to join Galatasaray on loan and the Italian striker set to sign for Nottingham Forest before the end of the winter transfer window. Meanwhile, the Azzurri agreed to a deal worth $20 million with Hellas Verona to sign young star Giovane from the Italian team. Napoli's winter moves suggest that the manager wasn't happy about some of the transfers made by the club in the summer. \nConte against his past Ironically, the two key matches for the Italian manager will be against two teams he coached over his career. In particular, his comeback in Turin is always special, although with varying meanings. At Juventus, Conte had his best years as a player from 1991 to 2004 where he won Serie A titles and even the Champions League final in 1996, despite suffering an injury in the final against Ajax that prevented him from playing in the UEFA 1996 Euro with the Italian national team. After he retired as a player in 2004, Conte started his coaching career and was appointed in 2011 by Juventus to become the new manager in what was also one of his first experiences as a Serie A manager. Conte immediately made his mark, launching a winning cycle at Juventus by clinching the Serie A Scudetto in his first season, followed by other two Serie A titles. He departed in 2014 following disagreements with the club over transfer strategy. Juventus and Conte always had a special relationship and could even be reunited in the future some day, but things got more tense with some parts of the club and the fans in the past years. In June 2019, the former Juventus captain was unveiled as the new Inter head coach and the games he played in Turin were always heated and full of emotions on both sides. Despite his Inter spell, most of the Juventus fanbase remained on his side, knowing his work ethic and attitude, even when he agreed to join Napoli in the summer 2024. Juventus fans know Conte and they accepted the fact he could coach any team in the world after joining Inter, but they were expecting a comeback in the summer 2025, shortly after he won the Scudetto with Napoli. Everything seemed set for his return to Turin. Juventus were searching for a new coach, Conte had just won the Scudetto in his first season at Napoli beating Inter in the title race and the Italian manager appeared increasingly unhappy at the club. However, in football things can change quickly. Despite comments from Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis that initially sounded like a farewell, he ultimately convinced Conte to stay and turn down Juventus' offer, something that the majority of the fanbase felt like a betrayal. \nWith how quickly things can change, as they did in the summer of 2025, this week could prove decisive for Conte's future. It doesn't necessarily mean he will step down or be sacked if results go against him, but Conte is a deeply emotional and passionate manager, and feelings often play a key role in his career decisions. Failing to beat Juventus and Chelsea could influence his mindset in the months ahead, something we've seen before and that has previously led to him leaving a club at the end of the season. Napoli don't need such uncertainty and neither does Conte himself.How to watch Serie A Matchday 22All times U.S./Eastern. Friday, Jan. 23Inter 6, Pisa 2\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Saturday, Jan. 24Como vs. Torino, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Fiorentina vs. Cagliari, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Lecce vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, Jan. 25Sassuolo vs. Cremonese, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Atalanta vs. Parma, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Genoa vs. Bologna, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Juventus vs. Napoli, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. AC Milan, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, Jan. 26Hellas Verona vs. Udinese, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason.

Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams, with both conference championship games taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the Championship Round NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are now 3.5-point home underdogs to utilize in NFL picks after opening at -5.5.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with that NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. Thus, there is a lot to consider before making any NFL playoffs bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (42.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under (-105) using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

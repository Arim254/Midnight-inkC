Punk defends his world heavyweight title against Finn Balor, plus two superstars will punch their tickets to WrestleMania 42.Punk has his hands full as the world heavyweight champion. He'll rematch Finn Balor at Elimination Chamber, the last major stop before WrestleMania. If he leaves Chicago with his champion status intact, Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns awaits him in Las Vegas.Elimination Chamber's two titular matches will also take place. The superstars who emerge from their respective steel structures victorious will earn world title matches at WrestleMania. Randy Orton and LA Knight are among those who've qualified for a shot at the undisputed WWE title. Tiffany Stratton and Rhea Ripley will compete with four other women for a shot at one of the two women's world titles as Royal Rumble winner Liv Morgan has still yet to make her decision on who she will face.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Feb. 28 with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.\nElimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. TBA vs. TBA vs. TBA vs. TBA: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. Two more triple threat qualifying matches are booked: Cody Rhodes vs. Jacob Fatu vs. Sami Zayn, and Gunther vs. Dominik Mysterio vs. Je'Evon Evans.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. TBA vs. TBA vs. TBA vs. TBA: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Two more qualifying matches are currently scheduled: Alexa Bliss vs. Giulia vs. Zelina Vega, and Asuka vs. Bayley vs. Nattie.\n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsUndisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Jacob Fatu: WWE subverted expectations by booking Rhodes and Fatu in the same Elimination Chamber qualifying match. All signs pointed to an eventual triple threat match between them and McIntyre. Rhodes is still the favorite to challenge McIntyre at WrestleMania. Maybe Fatu loses his qualifying match and earns a separate title shot against McIntyre. It seems odd to reward Fatu with a title opportunity if he loses his upcoming qualifier match. Whatever direction WWE takes, expect Fatu to orbit McIntyre in the next few months.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While most of the international hockey superpowers will be competing in Italy for the 2026 Olympics, there will be one notable absence. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) upheld sanctions that prevent Russia from participating in team events, like ice hockey, at the Olympics.Although the IOC is permitting some individual Russian athletes to compete under a neutral flag, that won't be the case for the hockey team. As a result, some of the best players in the world will be watching from home.Alexander Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin will miss what will likely be their last chance to compete for a gold medal. Other stars, like Kirill Kaprizov, Nikita Kucherov and Andrei Vasilevskiy, will have to wait at least four more years until they can take part in the Olympics.\n        \n            \n                Why are Russia and Belarus banned from 2026 Winter Olympics? Explaining sanctions, neutral athlete eligibility\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf the Russians were allowed to compete, they would field one of the most skilled rosters in the tournament. They would have the offensive firepower to hang with teams like Canada and the United States, and they would have a goaltending battery capable of slamming the door on even the most potent offenses.\nSo, what would a Russian Olympic roster look like? What would the strengths and weaknesses be? What would be the Russians' odds of capturing a gold medal? Let's dive into all of that with our hypothetical roster projection.What would a Russian Olympic hockey team look like?Forwards: Elite on the wing, lacking at centerIvan Demidov, CanadiensPavel Dorofeyev, Golden KnightsKirill Kaprizov, WildNikita Kucherov, LightningEvgeni Malkin, PenguinsKirill Marchenko, Blue JacketsRoman Kantserov, KHLVladislav Namestnikov, JetsValeri Nichushkin, AvalancheAlex Ovechkin, CapitalsArtemi Panarin, RangersAndrei Svechnikov, HurricanesDmitri Voronkov, Blue JacketsDanila Yurov, WildIt's hard to beat this collection of wingers, and Canada is probably the only team that can come close to matching it. Kucherov, Kaprizov, Panarin and Ovechkin are all legitimate superstars. Marchenko, Dorofeyev and Nichushkin are all underrated impact players. This Russian roster is oozing with firepower on the wings, but this forward group also showcases a clear shortcoming.However, the Russian team would be sorely lacking talent at the center position. The 39-year-old Malkin would probably take first-line responsibilities, and the rookie Yurov would anchor the second line. Behind them, you have Namestnikov and a KHLer in Kantserov. That's less than ideal in a best-on-best tournament like the Olympics. That said, Kucherov, Kaprizov and Panarin hardly need an elite center to drive play. That trio could carry the forward group on their own.\nRussia would be able to light up the scoreboard, but could it outscore teams with far better center depth? That would be an uphill battle.Defensemen: A solid group, but who is the true No. 1?Vladislav Gavrikov, RangersPavel Mintyukov, DucksAlexander Nikishin, HurricanesDmitry Orlov, SharksIvan Provorov, Blue JacketsMikhail Sergachev, MammothNikita Zadorov, BruinsArtem Zub, SenatorsHere we encounter another key weakness in this hypothetical Russian roster. There are some solid players here -- Sergachev, Gavrikov, Provorov and Zadorov among them -- but are there any true No. 1 options in the mix? Sergachev would be the most likely candidate, but he's produced mixed results as a top-pairing defenseman for the Mammoth. He's below water at five-on-five, and I doubt that would improve against tougher competition in Italy. Gavrikov and Zadorov would fit more of the shutdown mold, but I still think they would be on the wrong side of a mismatch against the very best forwards in the world, though that duo would bring plenty of physicality.\nThe most interesting player in this mix would be Mintyukov, a former first-round pick who hasn't achieved that potential in Anaheim yet. He has the most upside of all the Russian defensemen, but his floor is also quite low. In this instance, I think the Russians would take him because he's capable of making some superstar plays, something the rest of this blue line lacks.Goalies: Better than Team USA?Igor Shesterkin, RangersIlya Sorokin, IslandersAndrei Vasilevskiy, LightningThe only country that could remotely approach this level of goaltending would be the United States, and I still think the Russians would have a slight advantage. Russia has three true stars in goal, and this roster doesn't even include back-to-back Stanley Cup champion and two-time Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky.The only problem the Russians would have is determining which goalie would be their No. 1 in Italy. Perhaps that would go to the elder statesman in Vasliveskiy, who has a pair of Stanley Cup wins and a Vezina Trophy on his resume. All Vasilevskiy has done this season is post an .918 save percentage while leading the Lightning to the top of the East.\n\n        \n            \n                Winter Olympics 2026: Why this U.S. men's hockey team is poised to overcome woeful overseas history\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSorokin is having one of the best seasons of his entire career -- and that's a pretty high bar to clear. His .871 high-danger save percentage is through the roof, and Sorokin has pulled that off behind an Islanders roster that often doesn't stack up against its competition on paper.Assuming he would be healthy in time for the Olympics, Shesterkin is another decorated goaltender from Russia. The 2022 Vezina Trophy winner is one of the few things that's been working for the Rangers this season, and he is next to unbeatable when he's at his best.This trio has combined to save 44.2 goals above average in 2025-26, per Natural Stat Trick, and each one is in the top 10 of that category with Shesterkin and Sorokin topping the list at Nos. 1 and 2, respectively. No other team has that kind of support in goal, and it's one of the biggest reasons why the Russians would be capable of taking down Canada, Team USA and other international hockey superpowers for the gold medal.\nHow Russia would impact the hockey gold medal oddsFrankly, other top contenders are fortunate that Russia won't be participating in 2026. The Russians would be fully capable of making a gold medal run, and that's reflected in the odds.I sent my roster projection to the experts at SportsLine, and they calculated gold medal odds. As things stand now, Canada and Team USA are the clear favorites to win gold at +120 and +190, respectively. The addition of Russia would change that balance of power a bit.The Russian roster above would be +250 to win the gold medal, and it would also ding they odds for Canada (+150) and the United States (+210). That's not exactly a small shake-up, and the path to Olympic gold would be much harder for every team if Russia was making the trip to Italy.\n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

UFC 326 takes place at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on March 7.Holloway is a former featherweight champion and one of the greatest fighters in the history of that division. Holloway won the featherweight title when he unified the interim title with the undisputed title, then held by Jose Aldo, in June 2017. He made three successful defenses of the title before losing the belt to Alexander Volkanovski in December 2019.Holloway added the BMF title to his already impressive resume with a dramatic last-second knockout of Justin Gaethje at UFC 300. After a loss to Ilia Topuria in a bid to regain the featherweight title, Holloway defended the BMF belt with a decision win over Dustin Poirier at UFC 318.Oliveira is a former lightweight champion, capturing the title vacated when Khabib Nurmagomedov retired as champion with a UFC 262 win over Michael Chandler. Oliveira defended the belt with a win over Poirier before he lost the title on the scales, failing to make weight for his UFC 274 title defense against Gaethje in a fight Oliveira went on to win by decision.\nThe BMF title has been a symbolic title fought for by the most exciting fighters in UFC and Holloway and Oliveira certainly fit that bill. Oliveira holds the record for most finishes in UFC history with 21, most submissions in UFC history with 17 and has won 21 bonuses for Fight, Submission or Performance of the Night. Holloway has won 13 fight night bonuses, his 11 finishes are most in featherweight history and he holds numerous records for strikes landed both in individual fights and over a career.Let's take a closer look at the rest of the fight card below.

    "body": "\n        One of the most interesting and compelling competitions at the 2026 Winter Olympics is the team combined alpine skiing contest, a new discipline for the Milan Cortina Games. It's a great upgrade. The duo-oriented event features one skier barreling through the downhill and the other zig-zagging in the slalom. The lowest combined time after both races gets the gold. This team concept with these two races has never been in the Olympics before and figures to be one of the must-see attractions in future Games. With that as the backdrop, the setup was ideal in Italy for the United States and, in particular, for Breezy Johnson and American skiing superstar Mikaela Shiffrin. Johnson, who already won gold in women's downhill (in the same race that saw Lindsey Vonn's frightening crash), took to the mountain in Cortina D'Ampezzo Tuesday morning and came through again, finishing with the fastest time (1:36.59).Johnson's impressive push set up what was expected to be a shoo-in medal for her and Shiffrin, likely gold.\nBut ski racing is won and lost on tiny, icy margins and there is no guarantee, ever, that the favorites will come through. That axiom proved true again for Shiffrin on Tuesday. The 30-year-old was too inhibited out of the gate and then oddly stiff down her slalom run. Ultimately, she was incapable of maintaining the lead Johnson provided after the downhill portion. \nShockingly, Shiffrin delivered the 15th-slowest time (45.38 seconds) of the 18 slalom skiers, which pushed Johnson/Shiffrin to a fourth-place finish, .06 seconds behind fellow Americans Jackie Wiles and Paula Moltzan, who took bronze. (Austria's Ariane Raedler and Katharina Huber took gold, Germany's Kira Weidle-Winkelmann and Emma Aicher earned silver.)\n\"During my run I had a feeling that I wasn't getting my groove as well as -- sometimes, there's a feeling -- and I was trying to reset every turn and bring in more,\" Shiffrin told NBC Sports afterward, adding that there were \"so, so many positive things about the day, and I didn't really live up to that.\"She also admitted her comfort level wasn't where she wanted it to be for this race.\nCredit to Shiffrin for quickly taking to social media and congratulating Wiles and Motzan, by the way. A classy showing amid undeniable disappointment. That said, this is a bit worrying for someone as talented as Shiffrin. It's strange to see the best and most accomplished female skier in history tighten up again on the biggest stage, but that speaks to the pressure of the Olympics. The world is watching, as every athlete is all too aware of, and you have to be ready for anything in order to win everything. Any mistake -- or a chain of tiny ones -- will push you off the medal stand. \"We asked for a miracle and I think we were delivered one,\" Wiles told the press after securing bronze. \"I think if you let Mikaela go run that course ... I think she'd come down in the lead by at least a second.\" \n\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe good: Shiffrin finished without missing a gate. She got down the course in an Olympic event on Tuesday. Mentally, that's important. Her 2022 Beijing experience was a bizarre battle of mind versus body. Shiffrin had three DNFs and three non-podium finishes in China, failing to medal after being billed as the biggest American star of those Games. The bad: Shiffrin finishing 15th out of 18 skiers in her best event is almost inexplicable. This type of run was hard to imagine even after the regrettable 2022 no-show. It's her worst finish (that isn't a DNF) in almost 14 years.Most reading this may not realize it, but Shiffrin and Johnson won the 2025 world championships in this event. They've proven they can be the best in the world. Plus, Shiffrin bounced back well from Beijing in recent years, upping her record to 108 World Cup wins to go with eight world championship titles, plus two golds and a silver from previous Olympics. She has 71 victories in slalom alone, the most in history.\nShiffrin suffered a scary puncture wound to her abdomen while competing in 2025, but even after that she won more races. She is quite literally the best and most accomplished slalom skier ever. To finish 15th? What?She has now failed to medal in seven consecutive Olympic races. Rarely does an all-time great in an individual sport fail to meet the moment so many times in a row like this. Thankfully, it's not her last shot.Shiffrin has two more opportunities to medal. She'll ski in the giant slalom on Sunday, then return to the slalom course next Wednesday. Her Cortina story is still very much to be determined, but Tuesday's slip-up raises the stakes and anxiety around these Games for the biggest remaining star still competing on behalf of Team USA.\nCall it jitters, call it whatever you'd like, but Shiffrin's mental battle again seems to be creeping out of her head and manifesting in Olympic snow. She's as gracious in defeat as she is spectacular in victory; it's time for her to remember the latter as much as she's able to show the former. How Shiffrin readies herself for her next race on Sunday will be critical to salvaging these Games and upping her legacy among the all-time great Olympians in United States history.After Johnson put Shiffrin in quite literally the best position possible, most assumed she would return to form. And then she failed. As a result, now there's actual pressure on Shiffrin to go out and do something she hasn't had to do or feel in a long time: prove to everyone she's still the best skier in the world.\n            ",

Each of the six former players -- Favor Ayodele, Raeven Boswell, Makayla Elmore, Brooklynn Miles, Isabella Perkins and Jasmine Timmerson -- is represented by Keenan Holmes. Each suit alleges the university committed Title XI violations and Verdi inflicted \"emotional, psychological, and physical abuse\" against the players and created a \"hostile, discriminatory, and retaliatory environment.\"\"Verdi used his position of authority to engage in emotionally abusive conduct, retaliation, and psychological manipulation that transcended poor coaching and entered into constitutional violations,\" one lawsuit states. \"The program was defined by fear and emotional volatility as players were routinely demeaned, psychologically isolated, and pressured to perform under abusive conditions.\"In a statement to USA Today Sports, the university said the school is aware of the lawsuits and allegations and said they are \"without merit and will be vigorously defended.\"\nAmong several incidents mentioned in the lawsuits, according to USA Today Sports, are ...After one practice during the 2023-24 season -- Verdi's first with the Panthers -- Verdi allegedly told the team \"Every night I lay in bed I want to kill myself because of you.\"Ahead of a game against Clemson, Verdi allegedly \"directed xenophobic and culturally insensitive remarks\" toward a foreign-born player and told her \"ICE is coming.\"Perkins alleged she was \"routinely denied adequate medical care\" and forced to play while injured. When the issue was brought to Verdi, he allegedly retaliated. Ayodele also alleged poor treatment from Verdi when she was injured, saying he ignored \"her medical and emotional needs and [isolated] her from team support.\"Verdi allegedly mocked a player's appearance and weight and told her she looked pregnant.Verdi allegedly \"intentionally created and exploited racial division\" and disciplined players of color more harshly.The former players seek financial damages and acknowledgement that Pittsburgh failed to meet Title IX violations.Verdi came to Pittsburgh after a seven-year stretch at Massachusetts, where he inherited a struggling program and turned it into a conference champion. He is yet to replicate that success in Pittsburgh. The Panthers went 8-24 in his first season and 13-19 in his second season. They are 8-17 this season (1-11 in ACC play) and have lost eight straight games.\nPitt hosts Syracuse on Thursday.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tensions boiled over in Charlotte on Monday night during the second half of the Detroit Pistons' 110-104 victory over the Hornets, as a brawl led to four players being ejected.In the third quarter, Moussa Diabate fouled Jalen Duren in the paint. The two players then went face-to-face, with Duren giving Diabate a shove. The Hornets forward then completely lost his cool, and had to be restrained from chasing after Duren. At one point, he even broke loose and continued to go at Duren.Just as it appeared things were finally calming down, Hornets forward Miles Bridges went after Duren, which caused Isaiah Stewart of the Pistons to fly off the bench and charge after Bridges. \nDiabate, Bridges, Duren and Stewart were all ejected, and it's fair to expect that the NBA will hand down some suspensions for this.\nDuren said afterwards that \"emotions were flaring\" in an \"overly competitive game,\" per NBA.com. \"This isn't the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be,\" Duren said. \"But as a group we have done an OK job of handling that energy and intensity. At the end of the day, emotions got high with everybody being competitive. Things happen.\"However, the fracas was sparked by Duren putting his hand in Diabate's face, which \"is the most disrespectful thing you can do,\" Bridges told reporters the following day.\nIn the fourth quarter, Hornets coach Charles Lee was ejected following a questionable charge call on Grant Williams. Despite all of the drama, he said that Monday night was a \"freaking great game for us,\" given how Charlotte battled against one of the top teams in the league.\"This was a freaking great game for us,\" Lee said, via WCNC. \"Phenomenal opportunity for us to play the top seed right now, the No. 1 team in the East, the team that has been in the playoffs, they've been tested. They bring a level of physicality and competitiveness to them and I think they bring out the best in you and I think that overall our guys responded to every run that they went on, all the physicality, and so I think we got a lot better tonight. The result won't reflect that, but again, I thought our process and for most of the night our competitive spirit, our togetherness was really good.\" Charlotte vs. Detroit was viewed as one of the games of the night, as the Pistons lead the East with a 39-13 record, while the Hornets were red-hot and riding a nine-game win streak prior to Monday night's loss. Cade Cunningham was the star of the show, as he scored 33 points, grabbed nine rebounds and dished out seven assists.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While the New England Patriots' exceeded expectations this season, one notable player that didn't was rookie offensive tackle Will Campbell, whose struggles contributed to the Patriots losing to the Seattle Seahawks in one of the worst offensive showings in Super Bowl history. Less than 48 hours after Super Bowl LX, Campbell revealed to reporters that he played with a torn ligament in his knee during the season and was not 100% during the playoffs. That would help explain his highly-publicized struggles during the postseason that included allowing 14 pressures (a 26.9% pressure rate) and one of Seattle's six sacks of Drake Maye in the Super Bowl. \"It comes with the job,\" Campbell said of the outside criticism. \"When you don't perform, obviously, I was (drafted) high, paid a lot. So people expect a certain thing, and I expect more of myself. So whenever I don't perform, I don't expect everyone to be like, 'It's OK, buddy.' I mean, obviously it sucks. But it doesn't suck for anyone more than it sucks for me.\"After the Super Bowl, Campbell made more headlines after he declined to speak to the media, something that he apologized for on Tuesday. \n\"When I get emotional, I tend to have no mind,\" he said. \"And that's not the way that I need to approach this thing. I know myself, and if I would have spoken after, I would have said something that I didn't need to say.\"While Campbell didn't have his best day against Seattle, he wasn't the only Patriots' offensive player who can make that claim. Specifically, it was a forgettable outing for Maye, whose three turnovers set up 17 of Seattle's 29 points. Maye seemed tentative in terms of his decision-making until the game was already somewhat out of reach. Maye was hoping to make history by becoming the youngest starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl. Instead, he made unwanted history by breaking Joe Burrow's postseason record for times sacked (21). \nMaye, who also addressed the media on Tuesday, offered support for Campbell, a fellow former first-round pick who is surely hoping to make a similar leap in 2026 to the one that Maye had after his rookie season. \"The expectations of a first round pick, I think he's dealt with so much this year,\" Maye said of Campbell. \"It's going to be great for him in the future. He's going to be a great player in this league, he already is a great player in this league… I love Will. I look forward to playing with him for a long time.\"Based on Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said on Tuesday, it appears that Maye will continue play alongside Campbell for the foreseeable future. \n\"He's 22 years old. He's our left tackle,\" Vrabel said. \"He'll get better and get stronger. Moments where he played well ... there's plays he'd like to have back, but we're not moving Will to center or guard or tight end or anywhere else.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The David Njoku era in Cleveland is over. The tight end announced on his Instagram account on Monday that his time with the Browns has come to an end, saying \"[t]he time for me to find a new home has come.\"Cleveland, first off I love you. These 9 years have been a beautiful journey. I'm am so grateful for all the memories we shared together. Thank you to The Haslams, Andrew Berry and the whole browns organization for everything!! All my teammates I shared the battle with I'm so grateful for you guys. The time for me to find a new home has come and all I can think of is just the gratefulness in my heart. The city of Cleveland will forever be home.Njoku hits the free agent market at the age of 29 and coming off a season during which he averaged just 2.8 receptions and 24.4 yards per game while also missing several games due to injury. But he's also a high-level athlete with a history of high-level production before this past year: he topped 600 yards in four of his previous seven healthy seasons and had at least 58 catches for at least 505 yards and four scores in each of 2022, 2023 and 2024.The market could be fairly crowded this offseason, as players like Kyle Pitts, Dallas Goedert, Isaiah Likely and more are also set to be free agents. (Travis Kelce could be included in that group as well, but if he doesn't retire he will surely return to the Chiefs.) But that doesn't mean Njoku won't be sought after to some degree. So with that in mind, we wanted to scope out some potential landing spots that could make sense for him. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsThe Falcons could lose Pitts this offseason after he spent five years in Atlanta, and they'll need to replace him if he does leave. New Falcons head coach Kevin Stefanski is very familiar with Njoku from their time together in Cleveland. The Falcons don't have a player like Harold Fannin Jr. ready to take over as a high-level option like Cleveland did this past year, so Njoku could make a lot of sense for them. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington CommandersWashington lost Zach Ertz to a torn ACL toward the end of the 2025 season, and needs a pass-catching tight end to replace him. John Bates is more of a blocker and 2024 second-round pick Ben Sinnott has failed to distinguish himself as a receiving option through his first two seasons. If the Commies decide they need to look outside the building in free agency, Njoku could be a strong option.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsNew York has some interesting weapons on hand to help Jaxson Dart. Malik Nabers is an elite option when healthy. Cam Skattebo looks like a good running back and makes for a nice pair with Tyrone Tracy. If the Giants can bring Wan'Dale Robinson back, they'll also have a good slot option. But the pickings at tight end are fairly slim. Having someone like Njoku to stretch the seam and create yards after the catch would be nice. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe Bucs could lose Cade Otton this offseason, as he is also set to enter free agency. They seemingly have plenty of talent at wide receiver for Baker Mayfield to work with and therefore may not have need for another pass-catcher ... but Mike Evans is also a free agent. If one or both players leave, Tampa could look to add a versatile tight who can both block and work in the passing game. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia EaglesNot only is Goedert set to hit free agency, but so are Grant Calcaterra and Kylen Granson. So the only tight end left on the roster is Cameron Latu. Whether they want to address the position in the draft or not, they could have a need here if Goedert decides to pursue opportunities elsewhere. The Eagles need to figure out a way to open up the middle of the field for their offense, and Njoku could help them do that.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        North Dakota State is preparing to petition the NCAA for immediate access to the College Football Playoff and all competition as a new member",
    "body": "\n        North Dakota State is preparing to petition the NCAA for immediate access to the College Football Playoff and all competition as a new member of the Football Bowl Subdivision, the school's athletics director told CBS Sports.The FCS powerhouse finalized an agreement Sunday to move to the FBS on July 1, joining the Mountain West as a football-only member beginning next season. Under current NCAA rules, programs transitioning to the FBS must complete a two-year probationary period that bars them from postseason play, including conference championship games and the CFP.The Mountain West is aware of NDSU's plans and will support the school's petition to the NCAA, a conference spokesperson told CBS Sports.North Dakota State intends to argue that the bylaw is outdated, crafted before the transfer portal allowed programs to rapidly upgrade rosters and accelerate competitive timelines. The school intends to ask the NCAA for a waiver next season and also push the organization to permanently revise the rule to allow future transitioning programs immediate postseason eligibility.\n\"It's a very antiquated rule,\" NDSU athletics director Matt Larsen told CBS Sports. \"A lot of things have changed in our industry, and you could argue that's an overly punitive rule now.\"NDSU enters the FBS as the most dominant program in modern FCS history, having won 10 national championships over the past 15 years. The Bison are 9-5 all-time against FBS opponents, including five wins over power conference teams. Their arrival comes during a period of upheaval for the Mountain West, which is rebuilding its membership ahead of the departure of five schools to the Pac-12. The league's reset coincides with NDSU's arrival as a potential immediate contender in the conference, though it is handcuffed by rules written for a different era.The conference's competitive landscape will look markedly different this fall. The Mountain West's last four championships were won by departing members Boise State and Fresno State, leaving the league without its recent standard-bearers. Under current rules, NDSU would be ineligible for the Mountain West Championship in 2026 and 2027, though that would change if the NCAA grants a waiver or alters the bylaw.Financially, NDSU will not receive a full revenue share from the Mountain West through the 2031-32 season, the length of the conference's current media rights deal. However, the Bison would receive 50% of the CFP and bowl revenue distributed to full members beginning in 2026 if they reach the postseason, and 100% after their second postseason appearance, according to the conference's membership agreement obtained by CBS Sports through an open-records request. NDSU would also earn a $1 million bonus for reaching the CFP before 2032.\nNDSU is paying the Mountain West a $12.5 million entry fee over six years, in addition to the NCAA's $5 million reclassification fee, which increased from $5,000 to $5 million in 2023. The NCAA's probationary period was designed to give transitioning programs time to meet FBS benchmarks, including scholarship expansion and facility upgrades.Larsen contends that many modern programs already meet or exceed those standards upon entry. NDSU opened a $54 million football facility in 2022, funded solely by private gifts. Four of the last six teams to transition to the FBS reached the six-win threshold for bowl eligibility in their first season, including Delaware and Missouri State in 2025. Three programs transitioning in 2023 were denied postseason waivers, most notably James Madison, which started 10–0 under Curt Cignetti that season and two years later reached the CFP after its transition period ended.\nStill, there is a workaround: if fewer than 82 teams reach bowl eligibility, postseason games can pull transitioning programs to fill vacancies. But that does little to address NDSU's broader concern: how a CFP-caliber team could be ranked by the selection committee while being barred from competing, even if it were to go undefeated in the Mountain West in 2026 or 2027.\"I would argue whether I'm spending $5 million on football or $50 million on football, if my team is good enough, that shouldn't matter,\" Larsen said. \"... If you're truly trying to allow that program to be the most successful they can be, well, let them compete for championships. That's going to help keep your players and maintain your roster.\"NDSU's football operating budget is roughly $7.5 million, though Larsen expects that figure to double in the near future. The school opened a $54 million football facility in 2022, funded entirely through private donations.\nBy comparison, the average operating budget among Mountain West football programs next season is at least $13.5 million, according to 2023 data submitted to the Department of Education.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Steve Spurrier has been retired from coaching for a decade, but the former Florida and South Carolina coach hasn't lost his knack for speaking his mind. And when it comes to Clemson coach Dabo Swinney's recent allegations of transfer portal tampering, Spurrier didn't hold back.\"I thought by now somebody would've told Dabo, 'Dabo, there ain't no rules anymore,'\" Spurrier said Monday during a Zoom call with reporters ahead of his induction into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.Swinney's frustration this offseason stems from the case of Luke Ferrelli, a linebacker transfer from California. Swinney alleged in a Jan. 23 press conference that Ole Miss and new coach Pete Golding continued to contact Ferrelli after he had already signed with Clemson and enrolled in spring semester classes. Ferrelli ultimately flipped to Ole Miss, prompting Swinney to call the situation blatant tampering and hand evidence over to the ACC, which passed it along to the NCAA and SEC.Under NCAA rules, contacting a player in Ferrelli's situation would typically be prohibited, with potential penalties ranging from fines to recruiting restrictions. But Spurrier, 80, expressed skepticism that those rules are being enforced in today's college football landscape.\"They're still on the books, I guess, where you can't do it after this date or that date,\" Spurrier said. \"... But I don't know if they're ever going to enforce any rules now or not.\"\nInstead of dwelling on potential violations, Spurrier framed the situation as a reality check for Swinney and any coach reluctant to embrace the modern era of college athletics, where NIL, rev-share money and the transfer portal have reshaped roster construction.\"Gosh, basketball they've got pros coming back to play in college there,\" Spurrier said, referencing Alabama's Charles Bediako, who returned to play after signing an NBA contract and spending time in the G League -- only to have a judge recently deny his motion to remain eligible for the rest of the season. \"I think Dabo has learned now he's got to start paying his players just like everybody else is,\" Spurrier said. \"Or you'll get left behind. You can complain, but I don't know how good it's going to do.\"\nSpurrier's comments carry extra weight given his obvious history with Clemson. During his 11 seasons at South Carolina from 2005 to 2015, he went 6-4 against the Tigers, including a five-game winning streak against Swinney from 2009 to 2013. He finished his Gamecocks career with 86 wins, the most in program history, after previously winning a national championship and six SEC titles at Florida.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Stephen Curry will miss the All-Star Game -- and the Golden State Warriors' final two games ahead of the All-Star break -- due to runner's knee, coach Steve Kerr said Monday. The hope is for Curry to return for Golden State's first game after the break.The NBA announced Brandon Ingram of the Toronto Raptors will replace Curry. It's Ingram's second career All-Star Game selection; he also made it with the New Orleans Pelicans in 2019-20.Curry, 37, has not played since Jan. 30. He has missed the Warriors' last four games and will sit Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs.Curry was one of five All-Star \"starters\" selected from the Western Conference, though the format this season isn't East vs. West but rather a three-team event that features two U.S. teams and one \"World\" team. He is in the midst of another terrific season, averaging 27.2 points -- his best since 2022-23 -- while shooting 47% from the floor, 39% from 3 and 93% on free throws. He leads the NBA in 3-pointers per game (4.0) and free throw percentage.\nCurry has had to do considerable lifting for a Warriors team that recently lost Jimmy Butler to a torn ACL. Golden State is 29-25 entering Tuesday, eighth in the West.Curry is the second All-Star to have to drop out of the game due to injury. Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal strain) is out; Houston Rockets center Alperen Şengün is replacing him for the \"World\" team. Furthermore, commissioner Adam Silver added Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard to the All-Star Game in order to fill out the Team USA rosters with eight players apiece.\nIt's likely that a third injured All-Star -- the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo -- will not participate, either. As such, the World team currently has nine players, including Antetokounmpo.\n            \n    ",

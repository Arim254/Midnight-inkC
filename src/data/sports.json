    "body": "\n        UCLA coach Mick Cronin added another couple of highlights to a growing reel of snappy remarks and antics on Tuesday night during and after the Bruins' 82-59 loss at No. 15 Michigan State. First, Cronin sent one of his own players to the locker room with 4:26 remaining following a flagrant 1 foul. Then, after the game, he got into a bizarrely terse exchange with a reporter over a benign question.Both situations underscored the angst surrounding UCLA basketball entering the season's stretch run. As a No. 10 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model, the Bruins have lost three of their past five games and are backing up to the cut line for the field of 68.Cronin is wearing the stress of another unspectacular season on his sleeve. The first situation arose with UCLA trailing 77-48 with under five minutes remaining, when Bruins reserve center Steven Jamerson II committed a hard foul on Michigan State's Carson Cooper as Cooper elevated for a transition dunk.\nThe foul was called a flagrant, but it was not a \"flagrant 2\" foul, which would warrant an ejection. Nonetheless, Cronin demonstrably ushered Jamerson into the locker room. Afterward, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said, \"that's the first time I saw coach do it, but that sounds like Mick.\"Odd media exchangeCronin's next act after booting Jamerson was to snap at a reporter who was attempting to ask Cronin about chants from Michigan State's student section directed at UCLA center and former Spartans center Xavier Booker.\n\"I could give a rat's ass about the other the other team's student section,\" Cronin said.But that wasn't the end of it.\n\"I would like to give you a kudos for the worst question I've ever been asked,\" Cronin continued. \"You really think I care about the other team's student section?\"Cronin, who is in his seventh season coaching the Bruins, kept going from there.  \"Are you raising your voice at me?\" he asked the reporter.\"\nMick Cronin's reputation Rants, humorous comments, bluntness and the outward expression of frustration from Cronin are nothing new. Last season, he ripped his players as \"soft\" and \"delusional\" during a January low point of a 23-11 season.He regularly lambasts the Big Ten for UCLA's schedule, which features a handful of cross-country trips each year and the inevitable logistical challenges that come with it.One of his headline-grabbing remarks from last week was that he wants to find the \"biggest, nastiest, vodka-drinking Eastern European\" for his team.\nViewed in a certain light, Cronin is a funny character who is unafraid to speak his mind. But for UCLA fans growing fatigued of diminishing on-court returns, it might get old.UCLA's stretch runUCLA returns home to host No. 10 Illinois on Saturday as it enters a pivotal stretch of basketball for its NCAA Tournament hopes. The Bruins (17-9, 9-6 Big Ten) began the season ranked No. 12 in the preseason AP poll but came away from nonconference play with no significant victories.The Bruins' only win over a team expected to make the NCAA Tournament field as an at-large team came Jan. 20 against Purdue. But things started to get dicey on Jan. 31 with a 98-97 double-overtime home loss against Indiana.\nCronin was pointed in his postgame assessment following the IU loss, saying \"our defense was awful all night\" and calling out his team for \"pouting.\"Still, UCLA began its two-game road swing through the Big Ten's pair of Michigan programs at 17-7 (9-4) and with a little bit of breathing room on the bubble.After back-to-back losses to Michigan and Michigan State by 30 and 23 points, respectively, that breathing room is evaporating quick, and Cronin appears to know it.\n            ",

Thomas announced on Instagram -- with the help of country music star Luke Bryan -- that he would play the event, posting, \"See you Monday.\" Shelved since November 2025, when he underwent a microdiscectomy to repair a back issue, Thomas was cleared to return to full golf activities last week. Testing the waters in TGL before making his PGA Tour debut makes sense, as the simulator golf league will be a comfortable way to ease back into competitive golf and see how his body responds to making some swings without having to worry about walking a full 18 holes.Thomas is coming off a resurgent 2025 season in which he won for the first time since 2022 at the RBC Heritage and returned to a top 10 spot in the world ranking. He's dropped to No. 14 while inactive since the start of the 2026 season but hopes fixing his back issues will allow him to quickly return to the form he showed last year. If all goes according to plan, Thomas is eyeing a return at some point during the Florida Swing, as he shared in a post last month. \n\"Recovery has gone well,\" Thomas posted in January. \"I'm slowly building back my strength and conditioning in the gym, and also hitting wedges/short irons. Little victories and patience have been the biggest part of the process. Taking it slow and listening to how I'm feeling each day! I'm looking to come back competitively at some point during the Florida Swing. I know how important it is to get this injury behind me so that I'm only looking forward over the course of the season.\"The PGA Tour's trek through the Sunshine State begins next week at the Cognizant Classic. It is followed by a signature event at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the PGA Tour's flagship event, The Players Championship, in three weeks. \nPlaying in TGL will allow Thomas to evaluate his body and his game before testing both against the best players in the world outdoors. If he performs well at the SoFi Center on Monday and his body responds accordingly, Thomas may be back in action on the PGA Tour in early March.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Orlando Magic will return from the All-Star break without one of their star players, as the team announced that Franz Wagner will be sidelined indefinitely with a high left ankle sprain. Wagner returned for a two-game stint prior to the All-Star break from the same ankle injury that forced him to miss 25 games since early December.The Magic said Wagner is still experiencing soreness in his left ankle, and recent imaging confirmed that additional rehab time would be ideal before he returned to play. Wagner will be reevaluated in three weeks to determine the best course of action from there.Not having Wagner is a significant blow to an Orlando team that is hanging onto the No. 7 spot in the East. They may not be in danger of missing the play-in, but making the playoffs appears to be an uphill battle at this point without Wagner. In the games he's missed, the Magic have gone 12-13, not an encouraging number for a team that had high expectations entering the season.Injuries have been a theme for the Magic over the past two years. This year, Wagner has been the one whose missed a significant amount of time. Last season, it was Paolo Banchero who was limited to just 46 games, and as a result Orlando finished with a 41-41 record. Jalen Suggs has also been limited in each of the last two seasons, which also impacts their backcourt depth and defensive strength.\nBut even in the 18 games Banchero and Wagner have played together this season, the Magic have gone just 9-9. It's indicative of a team that has struggled to find any rhythm, which has translated to their on-court success. It's a difficult reality for the Magic, who were considered to be one of the teams who would rise through the mediocrity of the East to really challenge some of the top teams in the conference.Instead, Orlando is one of the mediocre teams this season, owning the league's 19th-best offense and 14th-best defense. Those are mediocre numbers in itself. And those numbers mostly reflect how the Magic have operated without Wagner, so there's little evidence to suggest this team can go on a run without him.With all of the injuries over the last two years to this team, it raises a question that has been talked about in the past regarding the future of the Magic with both Wagner and Banchero on the roster together. When both guys were healthy during the 2023-24 season, the Magic won 47 games and lost in a compelling seven-game series to the Cavaliers. And despite a playoff appearance a year ago, they weren't nearly as competitive in a 4-1 series loss to the Celtics. Both Banchero and Wagner averaged 25+ points, but neither shot the ball efficiently in the process. It's worth wondering if having both players is stifling their development, but the Magic probably aren't ready for that conversation.\nUntil then, we'll have to see how far Banchero can take Orlando on his own, and see if Wagner returns at all this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Less than two weeks after winning Super Bowl 60, the Seattle Seahawks are up for sale. The estate of Paul G. Allen -- the former owner -- announced Wednesday that the process to find a new owner is underway.\n\"The Estate of Paul G. Allen today announced it has commenced a formal sale process for the Seattle Seahawks NFL franchise, consistent with Allen's directive to eventually sell his sports holdings and direct all Estate proceeds to philanthropy,\" the statement reads. \"The Estate has selected investment bank Allen & Company and law firm Latham & Watkins to lead the sale process, which is estimated to continue through the 2026 off-season. NFL owners must then ratify a final purchase agreement.\"The sale is expected to fetch a record-breaking price for an NFL franchise, topping the $6.05 billion the Washington Commanders sold for in 2023, per CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. ESPN has reported the team could sell for between $7 billion and $8 billion.The news of the sale comes just weeks after a spokesman for the ownership group disputed reports the team was for sale.\"We don't comment on rumors or speculation, and the team is not for sale,\" the spokesman said before the Super Bowl. \"We've already said that will change at some point per Paul's wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.\"\nThe Seahawks did indeed win the Super Bowl, defeating the New England Patriots 29-13 for their second title. This marks the first time an NFL team has gone up for sale in the wake of participating in a Super Bowl, much less winning it.The Seahawks and the Trail Blazers have been owned by the estate of Paul G. Allen since the former owner of both franchises died of cancer in 2018. His sister, Jody, has controlled the teams in the years since his death. The Allen estate reached an agreement to sell the Trail Blazers to Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon in August 2025.Allen, who co-founded Microsoft along with Bill Gates, officially bought the Seahawks from Ken Behring in 1997 for $200 million, a move that saved the franchise from a potential move to Southern California.\nThe Commanders' bidding process featured several prominent names, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, before Josh Harris ultimately won out. Bezos could be a factor in the Seahawks' sale as well, per Jones.\n            ",

Durant was asked if the person behind the account was him, but he declined to give a direct answer.\"I'm not here to get into Twitter nonsense,\" Durant said. \"I'm just here to focus on the season. Keep it pushing. I get y'all have to ask those questions.\"In a follow-up question asking if he had discussed the allegations with his teammates on the Rockets, Durant once again declined to give a yes or no answer.\n\"My teammates know what it is,\" Durant said. \"We have been locked in the whole season. We enjoyed our break. Had a great practice today. Looking forward to the road trip.\"\nDurant, who is very active on all social media platforms -- including X -- has previously admitted to using a burner account. Back in 2017, Durant sent several tweets in a third-person voice from his personal X account with nearly 20 million followers explaining his decision to leave the Thunder for the Golden State Warriors while blaming the Oklahoma City organization and then-coach Billy Donovan.\nDays after the incident, Durant apologized and said he was \"disappointed\" in himself for the way he was \"acting so childish.\"\nDurant, who was traded from Phoenix to Houston last offseason, is averaging 25.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.4 assists in his first season with his team. The Rockets are the fifth franchise Durant has played for during his 18-year NBA career.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        A sense of desperation should follow both Auburn and Texas A&M on Wednesday night as they enter SEC tilts on four-game losing streaks that are making life stressful for a pair of first-year coaches. The Tigers are playing at Mississippi State in a Quad 2 game while the Aggies are at home against Ole Miss in a Quad 3 game.Both need to follow the lead of Georgia, which snapped out of a funk by winning at Kentucky on Tuesday night. That win bumped the Bulldogs from a No. 11 seed to a No. 10 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model.The duo are only part of a large collection of SEC teams that are either on the bubble or sliding close to it. Auburn fits the latter category as it enters Wednesday night as a No. 9 seed. But if this team continues struggling down the stretch, it may head into the SEC Tournament in an uncomfortable spot.Things are even more dire for Texas A&M, which would see its WAB (Wins Above Bubble) ranking decimated with a loss to the struggling Rebels. The Aggies don't want to fall below 50th in that vital resume metric, but they almost certainly would with a loss. Though the Aggies are still rating well in predictive metrics under high-octane new coach Bucky McMillan, they need to start finding the win column again.\nMissouri adds to Wednesday's SEC bubble intrigue as the Tigers host No. 19 Vanderbilt. It will be a showdown between two of the conference's most volatile teams and no sort of result in either direction would be shocking. Here is the full rundown of Wednesday's bubble action.Check out the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest bracket at the Bracketology hub                                All times ET                  Bubble teams in action Wednesday\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Texas A&Mvs. Ole Miss 7 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the day: No. 11 seedGame status: Quad 3\nTexas A&M has lost four straight games, dropping from a No. 7 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology to the bubble. With a Quad 3 home loss to Ole Miss, the Aggies would likely plummet to the 52-56 range in Wins Above Bubble (WAB), which is a vital resume metric used by the selection committee. For reference, the at-large team with the lowest WAB ranking last season was Xavier at No. 49. A&M still has good predictive metrics, and that could make a difference on Selection Sunday. But it needs some good old-fashioned victories down the stretch. The bleeding must stop here.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seton Hallvs. DePaul 8 p.m. (TRU)Entering the day: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 3Seton Hall can easily see the right side of the bubble from where it stands. Metrically speaking, it's not terribly far away. The problem is simply the means of getting there. The grim reality is that the next two games (Wednesday vs. DePaul and Saturday vs. Georgetown) are Quad 3 tilts, which can do little to help the Pirates bridge the gap between Next Four Out and the Last Four In. This team will likely need to finish 4-1 -- slaying either UConn or St. John's in the process -- to enter the Big East Tournament with an at-large pulse.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    West Virginiavs. Utah 8:30 p.m. (FS1)Entering the day: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 3West Virginia is like a child interacting with a revolving door for the first time. It just keeps going around and around while indicating no desire to actually enter or exit. How fun! Saturday's Quad 1 road win over UCF got the Mountaineers back in the Next Four Out realm, but a home loss to Utah would erase those gains and probably even stop the revolving door for good. Where actual progress can be made is on Saturday at TCU. But a Wednesday night victory must come first.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Auburnat Mississippi State 9 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the day: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 2If you haven't been dialed in on the SEC for the past couple weeks, it might be jarring to see Auburn appearing in a Bubble Watch. The Tigers beat Florida on the road, own a neutral site win over St. John's and were ranked in the AP poll for seven straight weeks at one time. But after four straight losses, the Tigers are just 14-11 (5-7 SEC). While they are still solidly a top-40 team across all selection metrics, uncertainty around the status of leading scorer Keyshawn Hall only adds to the angst of a prolonged slide. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Saint Mary'sat Seattle 9 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)Entering the day: Last Four InGame status: Quad Quad 2\nThis is one of two landmines that Saint Mary's simply cannot afford to step on prior to closing the regular season with high-profile games against Santa Clara and Gonzaga next week. The Gaels still have zero Quad 1 victories and zero victories over teams in the projected field. Yet, they are top-40 in resume metrics because of a 5-1 Quad 2 mark and because they have suffered no Quad 3/4 defeats. Saint Mary's cannot afford give the committee any reason to start asking questions about its lack of good victories.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Missourivs. No. 19 Vanderbilt 9 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the day: Last Four InGame status: Quad 1Missouri is coming off a weird week in which it edged Texas A&M on the road before getting smacked at home by Texas. Now the Tigers enter a three-game stretch that will largely determine their at-large fate. It begins Wednesday against Vanderbilt, continues Saturday at Arkansas, and concludes Tuesday against Tennessee. If Missouri wins two of those three, the picture will improve. Few, if any, teams in or around the bubble have dealt with as many injuries this year as Mizzou, which is another factor to consider.\nNCAA Tournament bubbleLast Four InSaint Mary'sMissouriSanta ClaraTCUFirst Four OutNew MexicoOhio StateSan Diego StateVCUNext Four OutCalOklahoma StateSeton HallWest Virginia\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As one of the most exciting, dynamic and often enigmatic superstars in the sport of boxing, Ryan Garcia typically walks to the beat of his own drum, which can often create opportunities that others don't receive. Take for instance the fact that Garcia (24-2, 20 KOs), who has never won a scheduled fight at 147 pounds and is fresh off of a lifeless defeat to WBA welterweight titleholder Rolando Romero last May, will challenge for Mario Barrios' WBC title on Saturday when the two meet in a headlining fight (DAZN PPV, 7:55 p.m. ET) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Garcia, 27, isn't just entering the fight against Barrios (29-2-2, 18 KOs) following a loss, he's also not that far removed from serving a one-year suspension for a failed a drug test following his 2024 win over Devin Haney (that later became a no contest), which led to his life publicly spiraling out of control amid drug use, a mental health episode and a series of racist rants on social media. One thing Garcia, besides his massive following on social media that features nearly 13 million followers on Instagram alone, has going for him is that when he's mentally present and prepared to fight, he has an almost electrifying combination of power and speed that is a potential problem for any elite foe. \n\"When I'm at the top of my game,\" Garcia told CBS Sports on Tuesday, \"I don't think anyone can really mess with me.\"The hardest part for anyone, from Garcia's fans and critics to Barrios, himself, is trying to figure out which version of \"King Ryan\" is going to walk through that door considering how many big moments in his career (when he got up off the canvas to knock out Luke Campbell in 2021) were immediately followed by low points (when he sat idle for more than a year battling mental health). Ryan Garcia's last five fightsOpponentDateResultRolando RomeroMay 2, 2025Unanimous decision lossDevin HaneyApril 20, 2024Unanimous decision win, later overturned to No Contest for failed drug testOscar DuarteDec. 2, 2023Eighth-round knockout winGervonta DavisApril 22, 2023Seventh-round knockout lossJavier FortunaJuly 16, 2022Sixth-round knockout winFor the record, Garcia believes there are justifiable reasons behind his poor performance against Romero (quickly referencing potential dark energy within the venue), he's just not willing to expand on them. And if his recent interviews are any indication, Garcia's behavior has seemingly alternated on the day between being a calm presence and a much more manic one, which only fuels his unpredictability, mostly because of how often he attempts mental warfare on his opponents.\"Most people don't know shit about boxing and I know a lot of people don't know anything about me,\" Garcia said. \"There are reasons why and I could explain them for the last performance I had but I'm not going to go into that. I feel like on Saturday, you are going to see something special from me. You are going to see a Ryan Garcia classic. That's it.\"Barrios, a 30-year-old native of San Antonio, enters as a firm betting underdog following his own string of uneven performances. For as great as he looked in retiring Yordenis Ugas in 2023 to claim the WBC interim title, both of his full title defenses have ended in frustrating draws, including against a 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last July. But even Barrios has had a difficult time trying to identify what to expect from Garcia.\"It's hard to say, really, where exactly he is at,\" Barrios told CBS Sports last week. \"I just have to prepare as if I have a focused Ryan in front of me, as they are saying. Everything else is kind of just background noise. We have to look at Ryan when he has been at his best and has looked extraordinary and just picture and imagine that is who we will be facing. Whatever version shows up, if it's any less, that's going to be for him to answer.\"I just feel like when Ryan faces adversity, he doesn't make the necessary adjustments and with this fight, I'm looking to go in there and exploit all of his weaknesses. I want to make him uncomfortable, I want to test his heart and test how bad he really wants to be in there.\"\nGarcia is well aware both of those who believe he doesn't deserve the title fight and those who question whether he can ever look as good again as he did in dropping Haney three times under the cloud of testing positive for ostarine. Forever the troll, however, Garcia's demeanor transformed from quiet confidence to theatrical disruptor when asked what the impact of a potential comeback stoppage win for him over Barrios would have on the boxing community at large.\"'Oh no, he's back! Oh no, he's really becoming what we didn't want him to become, the face of boxing. Oh no!'\" Garcia said while mimicking his critics. \"They are going to be real sad, the haters. But I'm just happy because I think I'm at a time in my life where I'm positioned to really represent what it means to be a champion and I can't wait to have that strap around my waist and hold it proudly and fight people that people expect me to fight and be a great champion.\"True to his nature of always seeking big fights (which includes a 2023 loss to Gervonta Davis that produced more than 1 million PPV buys), Garcia already has a target lined up next in his sights in the form of Shakur Stevenson, should he defeat Barrios. The 28-year-old Stevenson (25-0, 11 KOs) is just shy of three weeks removed from winning a title in a fourth weight division by widely outpoint Teofimo Lopez to capture the WBO belt at 140 pounds. Garcia was anything but impressed by Stevenson's performance and is confident that the two can meet next at a catchweight of 144 pounds (without the rehydration clause Davis used on Garcia). \n\"[Stevenson] controlled range really well and picked his shots. We give him credit for that but there was really nothing special for me that really catches my eye,\" Garcia said. \"He didn't really throw his left hand, he didn't finish [Lopez] off. You had a hurt little animal there that you could've just [finished] anytime you wanted but he played it safe every step of the way. That's just not how I fight. When I am beating someone up and they are pretty much done, you are going to see me take them out. \"That's just that simple but I've got that killer instinct. I guess you just have it or you don't and [Shakur] doesn't have it. So, when we step into that ring, he will feel the difference. That's who I want, for sure, sooner rather than later.\"Garcia, who will be cornered by his father Henry, has used the fallout of former trainer Joe Goossen joining forces for this fight with Barrios as an opportunity, including at the introductory press conference, to stir the pot and attempt to get inside Barrios' head. But separate from those type of theatrics, all signs have pointed to Garcia taking the fight very seriously because of how much he realizes a consecutive defeat would hurt his future options. \nNot only does Garcia believe he's the better fighter, he thinks the many wars Barrios has taken part in have slowly caught up with him. But regardless of the potential resistance applied by Barrios, Garcia has very much deemed this as a \"do or die moment\" for his career.    \"This is one of those moments or opportunities that I don't think I can get again, especially coming off of a loss. I feel like my back is against the wall, Garcia said. \"I'm just that guy. I'm just him. I don't think I'm a good guy or a bad guy, I think I'm just me. I'm competitive and I really want to win this bad, really bad. You are going to see a ferocious animal in the ring on Saturday night.\"\n            ",

It came in the form of a 91-80 victory at Purdue that pushed the Wolverines to 25-1 on the season and kept them No. 1 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings.If you check in here regularly, you likely know that I've written so much about Michigan lately. There's really nothing new to say. The Wolverines are undeniably awesome. And, like I told Matt Norlander on Wednesday's episode of the Eye On College Basketball Podcast, if they beat Duke on Saturday to improve to 26-1, I'm bringing back The Poll Attacks column on Monday unless Dusty May's team is the unanimous No. 1 when the Associated Press Top 25 poll updates in the afternoon.That's a promise.Anyway ...Again, I've written a lot about Michigan lately. So let's focus on another team in this space, and let's make that team Florida. Have you been paying attention to the Gators? Yes, they started slow, dropped four of their first nine games and fell to as low as 33rd in the NET in December. But after Tuesday's 76-62 victory over South Carolina, Florida is now 11-1 in its past 12 games.The day this stretch started was Jan. 6. If you go to BartTorvik.com and run the data from that point forward, the best team in the sport over the past six-plus weeks is Florida.\nThat's among the reasons I've jumped the Gators to No. 7 in the Top 25 And 1.

Lavin was hired in 2022 after his second lengthy stint working as an on-air college hoops commentator, but he couldn't bring the program to consistency in the Gonzaga-dominated WCC. Lavin leaves USD with a 46-79 record. The program has not made the NCAAs since 2008 under Bill Grier.The 61-year-old Lavin has a 283-229 career record, including his time at UCLA from 2006-03 and St. John's 2010-15.  \nSources said San Diego athletic director Kimya Massey has reached out to a few prospective candidates for the job in recent weeks. The target may well wind up being a sitting high-major assistant. The job will take on some increased appeal moving forward, as Gonzaga's move out of the WCC to the reborn Pac-12 next season will open up opportunities for other programs to make inroads in what's expected to largely be a one-bid league moving forward.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks announced Wednesday morning that Kyrie Irving will not make his long-awaited return this season. Irving has been on the sidelines since a torn ACL in March of 2025. Heading into this season, the Mavericks left the door open for a possible return from their veteran guard, but that door just slammed shut.\"This decision wasn't easy, but it's the right one,\" Irving said in the Mavericks' statement. \"I am grateful for the Mavericks organization, my teammates and our fans for their continued support throughout the process. I am looking forward to coming back stronger next season. The belief and drive I have inside only grows. And I wanted to send a huge shoutout to ALL of my brothers and sisters out there who've torn their ACL or gotten injured doing what they love to do every day. Thank you for the inspiration. No fear!\"Having Irving sit the rest of the season is in the best interest of everyone involved at this point. The Mavericks aren't contending for a playoff spot, and are better served losing games to improve their draft positioning. For Irving, it takes the pressure off of having to return too quickly and risking any complications to his injury recovery. The only positive that could have come was to see how he and Cooper Flagg worked together for a stint of games. Other than that, there's no point in risking the health of someone who will be 34 by season's end to come back too early. With no Irving return on the horizon, the last two months of the season now becomes about Flagg's development and looking ahead to the offseason. With a 19-25 record, the Mavericks head back to the draft lottery, where they have a chance to land another high profile talent from the collegiate ranks. Pairing Flagg with another top-end talent now becomes the priority, and with Anthony Davis no longer on the roster, Dallas can now put all its efforts into building around their superstar rookie.\nIt's certainly not the season the Mavericks hoped for when it started. Back in October, there were hopes of making the playoffs with Anthony Davis part of this core and Nico Harrison still running the team. But that plan quickly went out the window once Harrison was fired in mid-November. Dallas then further ditched Harrison's plans when Davis was traded in February for a lackluster return. But the return didn't matter as much as what it meant for the team: a chance to finally turn the page on the Luka Dončić/Davis trade debacle.Having Flagg as their new franchise centerpiece provides a path back towards contention for a Mavericks team that looked doomed to spend several years in lottery purgatory once it traded Dončić. Lucking into landing Flagg gave Dallas a get out of jail free card, now they have to do the equally difficult step in building around him going forward. The first step in doing that is hiring a general manager. The role has temporarily been handled by Matt Riccardi and Michael Finley, both of whom have been with the Mavericks' organization for some time. Both are being considered for the position, but if the Mavericks want to avoid another catastrophe like the Dončić trade, it would be smart of them to hire outside of the organization and not someone who most recently worked under Harrison.\nWith Irving not returning until next season, it sets up what could be a bounce-back season for the Mavericks. Not only will Irving be fully healthy, they also get back big man Dereck Lively II, who underwent season-ending surgery in December. Having that pick-and-roll duo at their disposal, as well as Year 2 of Flagg and whoever they land in the draft will be a far more competitive roster than what they've had for a majority of this season. And that's not even including what the Mavericks do on the trade market this summer. PJ Washington becomes trade eligible in the summer, and the interest in players like Naji Marshall and Daniel Gafford may only increase as this season ends. If Dallas nails its general manager hire, lands an elite rookie in the draft and gets key guys back healthy, they might be able to fast track a rebuild around Cooper quickly.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Champions League knockout playoff between Benfica and Real Madrid was delayed by 10 minutes on Tuesday night after Vinicius Junior reported an alleged racial incident. The Brazil attacker had just scored an outstanding opening goal in the 50th minute of the match in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz when anger built among home supporters, objects raining down on the pitch as Vinicius celebrated by the corner flag. The exuberance of his celebrations earned Vinicius a yellow card from referee Francois Letexier while tensions frayed between both sets of players.It was soon after that Vinicius sprinted over to Letexier and was seen pointing at Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni. The French referee made a gesture of crossed arms above his head, an initiative adopted by FIFA in 2024 to allow players and officials to signal that they believe racist abuse has taken place on the field. Television cameras caught Benfica forward Gianluca Prestianni speaking to Vinicius with his jersey covering his mouth; the Real Madrid man appeared to subsequently make reference to that while speaking to Letexier. Posting on his Instagram stories after the game, Vinicius said: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened today is new in my life and my family's.\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\nFIFA president Gianna Infantino chimed in on Wednesday morning as the sport's global governing body released a statement:\"I was shocked and saddened to see the incident of alleged racism towards Vinícius Júnior in the UEFA Champions League match between SL Benfica and Real Madrid CF.    There is absolutely no room for racism in our sport and in society – we need all the relevant stakeholders to take action and hold those responsible to account.    At FIFA, through the Global Stand Against Racism and the Players' Voice Panel, we are committed to ensuring that players, officials and fans are respected and protected, and that appropriate action is taken when incidents occur. I commend referee François Letexier for activating the anti-racism protocol by using the arm gesture to stop the game and address the situation.    FIFA and football shows full solidarity to victims of racism and any form of discrimination. I will always continue to reiterate: No to racism! No to any form of discrimination!\"  Speaking after the game, several visiting players also alleged that Prestianni had racially abused their teammate.\"This can't happen,\" Aurelien Tchouameni told Movistar. \"Vini told us that the kid called him a 'monkey.' [Prestianni] said he didn't say anything, that he said ... I don't know, 'f--gots' or whatever.\"  Federico Valverde added, \"We don't know for sure, but according to all the teammates who were nearby, he said something nasty that shouldn't be said. We've been fighting for this for a long time. Vini has fought for this, and if this keeps happening, it's a shame that a camera didn't record it. \n\"If you cover your mouth to say something, it means what you're saying isn't right. It's a shame. I'm proud of the teammates who defended Vini and proud of Vini for carrying on.\"\nMeanwhile, a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card as tempers built across the field. Vinicius was spotted in an embrace with Jose Mourinho before sitting on the Madrid bench, the delay to proceedings running to 10 minutes before the match was resumed at the hour mark.Speaking after the game, Mourinho, who was sent off for a separate incident, revealed that he had told Vinicius that \"the last thing [Benfica] is is racist,\" pointing to the fact that their greatest ever player, Eusebio, was black. The Benfica head coach said he wished to remain \"independent\" in regards to what may have been said by Prestianni but criticised Vinicius for his celebrations.\n\"Unfortunately, he was not just happy to score the goal,\" Mourinho told Amazon. \"When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"When it was put to the former Real Madrid manager that Vinicius had suffered racist abuse on several other occasions during his career, Mourinho said, \"Stadiums that Vinicius plays in, something happens, always.\"\n        \n            \n                Thierry Henry on alleged racial incident involving Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior: 'We belong, right?'\n                \n                    Chuck Booth                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThough there were no further flashpoints between the players, Vinicius' every touch was booed by the Estadio da Luz and the game was stopped momentarily in the 96th minute as items were thrown onto the pitch by supporters and once again in the 103rd minute as 12 minutes of added time were issued. Madrid would ultimately hold onto their lead with relative ease.\n\"Disgraceful to the sport,\" was how Trent Alexander-Arnold described the incident to CBS Sports. \"It's disappointing. It's ruined the night. It's a disgrace to the sport and society. There's no place for it.\"If incidents like this do happen, we can only deal with it like we did tonight. Very proud of the team, the club and the squad, how everyone reacted and got around Vini. You can see it's something upsetting and disappointing. We reacted the right way, we kept our heads and kept calm. We defended each other and we also played very well.\"Vinicius has been racially abused on multiple occasions during his time as a Real Madrid player, particularly in 2023, when the incidents included an effigy of him being hung on a bridge in the Spanish capital before a match against Atletico Madrid. His campaigns against such intolerance and hatred have won the 25-year-old widespread admiration in the footballing world and beyond, with the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul implementing \"Vinicius Junior laws\" that will see sporting contests suspended over incidents of racist abuse.\nThe Brazilian football federation swiftly issued a statement of support for their star player. \"The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) stands in solidarity with Vinicius Junior, victim of yet another act of racism this Tuesday, after scoring for Real Madrid against Benfica in Lisbon. Racism is a crime. It is unacceptable. It cannot exist in football or anywhere else,\" the statement read.\"Vini, you are not alone. Your action in activating the protocol is an example of courage and dignity. We are proud of you. We will remain firm in the fight against all forms of discrimination. We are by your side. Always.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Prior relationships can often play a role in free agency decisions. The league witnessed significant turnover at head coach after the regular season concluded. Could any of the 10 new head coaches entice a former player to join them in their new role?CBS Sports examines coaching changes, free agents and whether there may be a match based on a team's prospective needs. Other key hires, including offensive and defensive coordinators and offensive line coaches, were also taken into consideration. For example, last year's Ravens staff had two head coaches -- John Harbaugh (Giants) and Todd Monken (Browns) -- which could make competition for those free agents fierce.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Top 100 NFL free agents for 2026: Market light on big-name talent, but some stars to be had\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsHead coach Mike LaFleur comes over from the Rams, and the Cardinals have an overwhelming need along the offensive line. Unfortunately for Arizona, the Rams' offensive line will hardly be impacted by free agency. (The two offensive players of consequence are tight end Tyler Higbee and wide receiver Tutu Atwell, and Arizona already has Trey McBride.)There are multiple offensive linemen from offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett's time in New York: guards John Simpson and Alijah Vera-Tucker, along with tackle Max Mitchell.\nLaFleur retained defensive coordinator Nick Rallis, so there aren't any new markets for the team to tap.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsThe closest connections are in Cleveland, given Tommy Rees and Kevin Stefanski's recent foray into northeast Ohio. Tight end David Njoku may be an option if the team does not retain Kyle Pitts. Defensive lineman Shelby Harris and cornerback Martin Emerson could be cost-efficient additions, while linebacker Devin Bush would come at a steeper price.Alex Van Pelt comes over from New England, but there are few offensive free agents from the Patriots. Defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich was retained by Stefanski, creating potential ties to some of his former Jets players — including safeties Andre Cisco and Tony Adams, linebacker Quincy Williams and edge rusher Micheal Clemons.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore RavensJesse Minter previously served as defensive coordinator in Los Angeles. A few of the Chargers' free agents already have a history with both Minter and the Ravens organization, including edge rusher Odafe Oweh and safety Tony Jefferson. A pair of defensive linemen -- Da'Shawn Hand and Otito Ogbonnia -- could serve as depth for Baltimore.One area in which Minter has excelled early is coaching staff construction. The team has pulled from a variety of places, which should breed familiarity during the free agency process. Offensive line coach Dwayne Ledford comes over from Atlanta, defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver most recently spent time in Miami, and offensive coordinator Declan Doyle worked alongside Ben Johnson in Chicago last season.Bears wide receiver Olamide Zaccheus could be a depth option. The team could also kick the tires on a trade for D.J. Moore to give Lamar Jackson another weapon. Elijah Wilkinson would be a viable replacement for right guard Daniel Faalele, or at least competition for whoever fills that role.\nCornerbacks Jack Jones and Rasul Douglas could be added from Miami to provide competition or depth.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo BillsJoe Brady is obviously not new to the organization, but a few of his lieutenants are. Offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael has been alongside Sean Payton for more than two decades. Perhaps center Sam Mustipher would be an option if the Bills opt to pay Connor McGovern rather than offensive guard David Edwards. Reserve Saints lineman Landon Young could be a cheap option from Carmichael's past as well. On defense, Buffalo hired Jim Leonhard as defensive coordinator. After spending the past two seasons in Denver, he could add depth or competition in the form of linebackers Alex Singleton and Justin Strnad.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsThe Browns have brought over much of Baltimore's offensive staff, including offensive line coach George Warhop. The offensive line is expected to be a point of emphasis this offseason. Center Tyler Linderbaum is the belle of the ball in free agency; few players will carry a price tag as steep as his.Would they consider offensive tackle Joseph Noteboom or guard Daniel Faalele if they're concerned about alternative options? Tight end Charlie Kolar could be an inexpensive complement to Harold Fannin Jr., but Isaiah Likely's skill set is too redundant with Fannin's. There are no wide receivers who would meaningfully elevate Cleveland's experience.The Falcons' Mike Rutenberg has been identified as the new defensive coordinator, but there isn't much to bring over from Atlanta.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersHead coach Klint Kubiak comes over from the Super Bowl champion Seahawks, while the team promoted Rob Leonard to defensive coordinator.Kubiak will obviously have some familiarity with Seattle's defense, and that's where his new team could stand to benefit. The Raiders' defense is fairly deficient, and multiple Seahawks starters are on pace to hit the open market, including edge rusher Boye Mafe, cornerbacks Josh Jobe and Riq Woolen, as well as safety Coby Bryant.On offense, wide receiver Rashid Shaheed would be an asset to Las Vegas as it aims to replace lost production from Jakobi Meyers and Tyler Lockett. Kubiak also coached Shaheed in New Orleans.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsHaving led the Packers' defense this past season, Jeff Hafley will have intimate knowledge of its players, including cornerback Trevon Diggs and his health. In terms of free agents, Green Bay is mostly vulnerable to losing depth options such as pass rusher Kingsley Enagbare and linebacker Quay Walker. Edge rusher Rashan Gary and others could be available via trade.Miami is also expected to have interest in Malik Willis as Tua Tagovailoa's replacement. Offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik most recently worked in Houston, but the Texans don't have any offensive free agents with whom Slowik would be especially familiar or interested.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsHead coach John Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Matt Nagy likely share a philosophical belief in larger personnel groupings, as only the Browns played a higher percentage of two-tight end sets than the Ravens, while the Chiefs ranked just outside the top 10. Theo Johnson returns, but Daniel Bellinger is headed for free agency. Isaiah Likely's skill set would complement Johnson's.\nIt would not be a surprise if the team also showed interest in center Tyler Linderbaum and guard Daniel Faalele. Defensive lineman Dre'Mont Jones and tight end Charlie Kolar are a few others who could draw consideration.Titans defensive linemen Sebastian Joseph-Day and Jihad Ward could also fit as part of the rotation, with former defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson now in New York.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersMike McCarthy took a year off but spent five seasons as head coach of the Cowboys. Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham most recently worked with the Raiders, who fielded one of the league's worst defenses.\nCowboys wide receiver Jalen Tolbert could step in as a depth option.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee TitansRobert Saleh's experience in both San Francisco and New York could allow Tennessee to rebuild its defense quickly.The Jets have a handful of useful players hitting free agency, including linebacker Quincy Williams, safety Tony Adams and edge rusher Micheal Clemons. Tennessee could also look to continue rebuilding its offensive line with Jets guards John Simpson or Alijah Vera-Tucker.The Titans also hired former Giants head coach Brian Daboll, along with a few members of that coaching staff, including the offensive line coach. New York doesn't have many notable free agents aside from wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson. Cornerback Cor'Dale Flott could serve as competition, while tight end Daniel Bellinger could provide depth.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It can be easy to get lost in the sea of metrics, acronyms and analytics-based services that start flying around the college basketball universe this time of year. On official team sheets used by the NCAA Tournament selection committee, there are a whopping seven metrics, all with some sort of shorthand abbreviation.If you only have the bandwidth to master one before Selection Sunday, consider learning Wins Above Bubble. Introduced officially last season to the NCAA Tournament selection process, WAB is a resume-based metric rapidly becoming a staple of the college hoops lexicon.WAB is unaffected by victory margin and simply measures what you've accomplished against your schedule vs. what the average bubble team would have accomplished against the same schedule.\"I think fans would be probably pretty surprised that the selection of the at-large teams was probably more highly correlated to a team's WAB ranking than it was their NET ranking,\" NCAA senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt told CBS Sports, referring back to last year's selection decisions.\nOne high-profile example: at No. 42 in WAB, North Carolina edged No. 43 West Virginia for an at-large spot. The Tar Heels owned a 0.79 WAB \"score\" vs. a 0.78 mark for the Mountaineers.That meant UNC had a projected 0.79 more wins against its schedule than what the average bubble team would have produced. The 2025 NCAA Tournament selection process brought the significance of WAB into focus, and for good reason. It's a useful tool because it allows for a comparison of two teams that have played vastly different schedules.\n\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Michigan cements itself as No. 1 overall seed, Nebraska slips to a No. 4 seed\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nExample: Miami University (No. 33) and Auburn (No. 38) were separated by five spots in WAB on Wednesday morning, despite the fact that the Redhawks have zero losses and Auburn has 11.How WAB worksUsing a combination of each opponent's strength and the location of the game, WAB puts a 0-1 score on each game based on how likely the standard bubble team (No. 45 in the NET) would be to win. Big-time opponents bring big-time WAB payouts for wins and relatively small WAB hits for losses.According to wabwatch.com, Auburn's win at Florida on Jan. 24 is worth a whopping 0.92 in WAB. That's a hefty number which acknowledges how difficult it is to slay a highly ranked NET foe like Florida on the road. \nAn average bubble team would only be expected to win that game 8% of the time. As such, losing that game would have only brought a 0.08 reduction in Auburn's WAB score, which sits at 1.78 as the Tigers prepare to play at Mississippi State on Wednesday night.By comparison, Miami University's MAC victories are producing paltry WAB returns. As estimated by wabwatch.com, the Redhawks' Jan. 31 home win over Northern Illinois brought Miami a laughable 0.02 addition to its WAB score. But because the Redhawks haven't lost a game, those small gains in WAB have been adding up, and Miami's WAB score is 2.07 after Tuesday night's win at UMass.That WAB figure and a low-to-mid 30s WAB ranking is good enough to put Miami in at-large territory...for now. But if the Redhawks lose, it will be a costly defeat against a MAC opponent that would bring roughly a 7-10 spot drop in Miami's WAB ranking, which could matter significantly in the selection process.\nWhile it's improbable that any selection or seeding decision made by the committee would be based on a single metric, WAB can be a guiding light in resume evaluations. It certainly was in 2025.\"Well the hardest decisions the committee has to make, I think, are probably those ones at the bottom of the at-large selection, right?\" Gavitt said. \"There's a reason why everyone tracks this so closely, the bubble teams. Who is going to get in and who's not going to get in? Comparing those resumes is often a real challenge when you have schools from different leagues, or very different schedule strengths. \"You really want to try to rightsize that as much as possible and be comparing apples to apples versus apples to oranges. And the WAB, I think, has helped the committee do just that.\"\nWhat about the NET?NET has become one of the most commonly referenced college basketball metrics since the NCAA introduced it for the 2018-19 season. The \"NCAA Evaluation Tool\" remains a vital cog in selection methodology.However, it is not necessarily a \"resume\" tool. NET is influenced by margin of victory and efficiency, which is a feature and not a bug. Because of the way it's designed, a team's NET ranking gives a view of how difficult that team is to beat and not necessarily a full view of its resume. UConn is a great example. The Huskies are No. 10 in NET entering their Wednesday game against Creighton. Yet, they are projected as the fourth No. 1 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology. Why? Because of a resume that ranks No. 3 in WAB and is highlighted by victories over Illinois, Florida and Kansas.\nBut as a team that has found itself in a handful close battles against mediocre opposition during a 14-1 start to Big East play, UConn is not enshrined by predictive metrics.As Gavitt put it to CBS Sports, \"where your team is ranked in the NET is far less important than where your opponents are ranked in NET.\" Your opponent's NET ranking and game location determines if the game is classified as Quad 1, Quad 2, Quad 3 or Quad 4. And your opponent's NET ranking is also used in formulating the WAB impact that comes with a win/loss.\n\"We're glad that there's a focus on the NET, because it's something we developed, we think it has a lot of utility,\" Gavitt said. \"But at the same time, we want to make sure people are not hyper-focused or overly focused on that, because it's really just one component. Frankly, there are other things that weigh in much more significantly in the process these days than your overall team NET ranking.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        HOT SPRINGS, Ark. — A year ago, Indiana's defensive coordinator let a secret slip.He was on his way to the Broyles Award ceremony in central Arkansas, fresh after he and his wife, Kira, learned they were expecting their first child. They told only close family members, planning to share the news publicly later.Bryant Haines couldn't wait.A finalist for the Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant coach, he stepped on stage in front of about 1,000 people on Valentine's Day weekend and shared the news himself. He spilled the family's biggest secret -- and left without the trophy.One year later, he returned and hoisted the 70-pound award, this time with his wife and their seven-month-old daughter beside him.\n\"This is such a big event with first-class people and I wanted to share my life with this group,\" Haines told CBS Sports. \"I'll be associated with this event forever now. I'm always a part of this. I'll have my name associated with coach (Frank) Broyles and I can't think of a greater honor than that.\"Still, the avalanche of accolades and Indiana's incredible undefeated run to the national championship after starting the season as the losingest program in college football history haven't quite sunk in.\"[Grace] has been at every game, she's 16-0,\" Haines told the crowd last week. \"Never tasted defeat.\"\nHaines is reminded daily of the Hoosiers' 16-0 season wherever he goes. Fans stop him in the community and his phone hasn't stopped buzzing. At work, multiple championship trophies sit inside Curt Cignetti's office. There has also been an avalanche of post-season honors and ceremonies. Still, there's a disconnect from this new fairy-tale reality that has become one of the top stories in modern sports history.\"A moment will hit me where I feel like, man, we did do something really unique and special, but I honestly think that the full totality of what we did won't truly settle in for a year,\" Haines said. \"It'll take that long because there's always something else. There's something brewing right around the corner that we need to prepare for because we've got a game coming up in six months. That's how coach Cignetti runs the operation. Very process-oriented, one day at a time.\"Even during a two-day respite at Oaklawn Resort, watching horse races and attending the Broyles ceremony, his mind drifted back to film.\n\"I'm a little bit behind,\" he said. \"I need to self-scout and figure out how we gave up so many rushing yards in the second half against Miami.\"Joking or not, Haines is a film junkie, much like his boss. Miami averaged 10 yards per rush in the second half of Indiana's 27-21 national championship victory, and yet Haines' defense ranked in the top five nationally in four major categories, including scoring (11.7 points per game) and total defense (266 yards). The rush defense finished second, allowing only 77.2 yards per game.As for why the historic significance of Indiana's climb to the top of college football hasn't quite affected Haines, he offers context: winning has never felt abnormal. He has coached alongside Cignetti in all but one season since 2014, from Division II IUP to Elon, James Madison and now Indiana. Together, they are 108-28.\n\"Maybe that's what makes it weird, because all we've known is winning,\" Haines said.History suggests his future could hold more. Nineteen of the Broyles Award's 30 winners later became head coaches, including 13 of the last 18. Haines has drawn interest from other programs the past two offseasons but chose stability, signing a three-year, $9.3 million contract in December that made him the highest-paid assistant coach in college football.\"One, there's a lot of money involved now. Two, I still believe in loyalty,\" Haines said. \"I'm an old-school guy that way. I'm a blue-collar guy, just like coach Cignetti himself, and loyalty is still part of it for me. I know what's expected of me every single day. Coach Cignetti knows what he's gonna get out of me every day, so there's a lot of trust between the two of us, and that makes for a great working environment.\"\nFor now, he isn't chasing the next job. He's chasing the next adjustment. He currently has no interest in becoming a head coach.\"Not at the moment. I like what I do,\" he said. \"What I like about football, to be honest with you, is schematics. I like X's and O's. I like game plans. I like attack plans. I like coverages, disguises, shell rotations. That's not head coach talk, that's coordinator talk. So, when I'm done doing that and I get bored doing that stuff, maybe then I'll be willing to look at putting a head coach's headset on.\"\n            ",

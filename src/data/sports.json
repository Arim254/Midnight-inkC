However, he then lost his next bout for the UFC Lightweight Championship, falling to Khabib Nurmagomedov. Gaethje had another shot to claim gold when he challenged Charles Oliveira for the title at UFC 274 but again came up short. He has held the symbolic UFC \"BMF\" title, which he won via a triumph over Dustin Poirier at UFC 291. Check out SportsLine to see Vithlani's picks and analysis.Pimblett, 31, has a BJJ background and made his professional debut as a 17-year-old in his native Liverpool, England.

Krylov (30-11) is No. 13 in light heavyweight rankings, while Bukauskas (19-6) is unranked. The former has advantages over his opponent in a number of metrics, including significant strikes landed per minute, significant strikes accuracy and takedowns average. Bukauskas also lacks a diversified attack as just one of his last 17 bouts have seen him win via submission, while Krylov has over a dozen MMA wins via both submission and with a knockout.\"[Krylov] seems very focused in this training camp and is still only 33 years old,\" Vithlani told SportsLine. \"If Krylov can find his old form, his MMA game will be a lot more diverse than Bukauskas.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs continue on Sunday with the AFC Championship Game and the NFC Championship Game. Patriots vs. Broncos (+3.5) kicks off at 3 p.m. ET, followed by Rams vs. Seahawks (-2.5) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Those who've made NFL picks against the spread all year are probably aware that New England and Seattle each have a league-high of 13 spread wins this season. The Rams (12) are just behind them, but with Denver having just eight ATS victories, the Broncos could be ones to fade with Championship Round NFL predictions.While that may have you leaning towards one side in the AFC title game, what should you make of the NFC Championship Game with your NFL bets? They split their two regular season matchups both versus the line and outright, with the Rams winning the first by two points and the Seahawks winning the second by one point. Having insight beyond ATS records may make one side more appealing for conference championship NFL predictions, and that's where utilizing betting trends from NFL experts comes in handy. Before locking in any Championship Round NFL picks or NFL prop bets, be sure to check out the Championship Round NFL best bets and predictions from SportsLine's red-hot Vegas experts. SportsLine has more than 40 hand-picked Vegas experts who excel in multiple spots.

Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top Championship Round NFL expert picks from R.J. WhiteWhite, CBS Sports' managing editor of Fantasy and gambling, is 21-15-1 (+445) on his last 37 over/under picks. For Patriots vs. Broncos, he is backing Under 42.5.\"The Patriots defense has run roughshod over a pair of offenses with major injury concerns the last two weeks, and they'll get another with Jarrett Stidham at QB. Playcaller Zak Kuhr is in his bag, completely outmaneuvering the Chargers and Texans, and Stidham faces an uphill battle to score points. Drake Maye's offense has struggled with turnovers against two top-tier defenses and gets another here, and the margin between the Broncos and second place in sacks was more than the gap between No. 2 and 9. Maybe another defensive score ruins this Under like it did last week in Texans-Pats, but I have to back it above the key number of 41.\" See all of White's picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop NFL picks from Alex SelesnickA prop-bet specialist, Selesnick, who is better known as PropStarz, has returned nearly 45 units since joining SportsLine. He enters this weekend on a 61-44 roll on NFL player props that has returned nearly $1,000 for $100 players. This week, PropStarz is going Over 17.5 receiving yards for Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III.\"Kenneth Walker has cleared this line in seven of eleven games since the Seahawks Week 9 bye. This, of course, is despite an almost 50/50 route share split with Zach Charbonnet. With the latter back out for the season, I expect Walker to take on a bigger role, which should include more pass plays. It's a great matchup for him, as the Rams allowed the fifth most receiving yards to running backs in the regular season (38 yards per game), with an opposing back clearing this line in nine of their last eleven games. This includes Walker's 64-yard and 44-yard performances (Charbonnet with six total targets and 32 yards as well).

While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +242 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction. Before making any Championship Round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Championship Round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.1 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top Championship Round NFL parlay picksFor the Championship Round, one of the picks featured in the parlay is taking Denver's Zach Allen to have 1+ sacks (+191) versus the Patriots. Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record at least half a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

    "body": "\n        Fans who will be attending this weekend's AFC Championship between the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots will need to bundle up. The weather in Denver Sunday afternoon is expected to be a high of 21 degrees and a low of 8 degrees, per weather.com.The game starts at 3 p.m. ET, 1 p.m. local time, so the temperatures will be closer to the high. There is a 49% chance of snow, with one inch expected, and winds up to 12 miles per hour. Sunset will take place at 5:11 p.m., so players and fans should get sun for the entirety of the game, helping those cold temperatures feel a little less brutal.There will be partly cloudy skies in the morning with occasional snow showers in the afternoon. The day is described as \"very cold\" by weather.com. But how the weather will affect the game will be the bigger question for fans, as well as for other interested parties. A 12 mph wind may have a slight impact the passing or kicking game, however, that calculus changes if that's combined with an active snow fall. Science tells us that as it gets colder the resistance increases, making it harder to have longer kicks. At the same time, Denver's mile-high elevation does enable a kicked ball to travel a few yards further than one at sea level, assuming all other conditions are constant.\nFormer Patriots kicker and four-time Super Bowl champion Adam Vinatieri, who happens to be serving as New England's honorary captain for the game, had many experiences with kicking in the cold. He has talked about the feeling of the ball changing due to cold weather. When players get cold, their hands could become numb, meaning quarterbacks could have a harder time throwing. Holding on to the ball and blocking can also become more of a task. Patriots quarterback Drake Maye has struggled with fumbles in the last two playoff games, with six in the wins. His ability to maintain control of the ball could be a big factor in which team makes it to Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, California, on Sunday, Feb. 8.\nThe cold weather makes reaction times slower and changes the density of the air, which can impact the passing game.In a 2024 game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins, the -4 temperature had visible impact. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes had a chunk of his helmet come off after a hit and the leading theory is it happened due to the cold weather. In the same game, coach Andy Reid's mustache froze and water froze instantly.Ways to combat the cold include layers and scuba suits, which is something former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady swore by. Players who prefer playing without sleeves may have a difficult decision to make. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel is known to wear at most a sweatshirt and vest, even in cold games, but he too may need to switch up his typical look.\nHot chocolate and soup are typically available on the sidelines for these type of games to help on-field personnel warm up between plays. Heaters will also be on the sidelines.Sometimes, cold weather can be an advantage for the home team, if they are playing a team from warm weather, but in this case, both squads are used to frigid temps. Weather aide, the Patriots are 0-4 against the Broncos in the playoffs when the game is played in Denver. Then again, that last postseason meeting between these two teams was 10 years ago and so all of the key players are different.\nThe weather in the NFC Championship between the Seahawks and Rams in Seattle will be balmy by comparison. Sunday's forecast at kickoff is expected to be sunny and 44 degrees with virtually no wind. It'll will likely dip into the upper 30s during the second half, and the chance of rain is extremely low. The AFC Championship will be broadcast on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ at 3 p.m. ET and the NFC Championship can be seen on Fox at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The best player in the world has made his presence felt in his first tournament of the season as Scottie Scheffler backed up his Thursday 63 with a Friday 64 to post a leading line of 17 entering the weekend at the 2026 American Express. Scheffler is bogey-free through two rounds at the American Express, as he has torched La Quinta Country Club and the Nicklaus Tournament Course, taking advantage of ideal desert conditions.The lack of wind has given the three-course rotation for this tournament little defense against the best players in the world, and no one has attacked them better than Scheffler. \nThe No. 1 golfer in the world will now move over to the Stadium Course at PGA West, which presents a bigger challenge than the other two courses across the final 36 holes. Scheffler is excited about playing a course that rewards great play and punishes mistakes. \"That golf course is a lot tougher than these other two, ball-striking-wise. You've got to get the ball in play,\" Scheffler said. \"You can shoot a low number out there, but you've gotta really be getting the ball in play. It can punish you pretty quick. There's a lot of water on the golf course. I think it's a really good challenge. I think it's a great course in terms of, when you're hitting it well and you're putting the ball in position, you can shoot a really low number. And if not, you're gonna get punished pretty severely for it.\" \nJoining Scheffler at the top of the leaderboard is 18-year-old Blades Brown, who played his sixth consecutive competitive round of golf on Friday after participating in a Korn Ferry Tour event located in the Bahamas from Sunday to Wednesday. Brown also played the Nicklaus Tournament Course on Friday and came out of the gates firing, going 8 under through his first seven holes (starting on the back nine) to firmly put himself on 59 watch. Brown got to 12 under through 15 holes, meaning he needed just one birdie on the final three holes to post the 16th round of 59 or better in PGA Tour history. Brown couldn't capitalize on the par-5 7th or a terrific tee shot on the par-3 8th, leaving himself needing a birdie on No. 9 -- his 18th -- to shoot a 59. After bombing a drive, he had just a gap wedge left for his approach and stuffed it within 5 feet to set up a short birdie putt. \nUnfortunately for Brown, he pushed his birdie putt off the right edge and finished par-par-par to shoot 60 and post a course record on the Nicklaus Tournament Course. \"Absolutely ... of course I did, yeah,\" Brown said with a laugh when asked if he felt added pressure on the last three holes. \"I just stuck to my game plan. I said I'm going to execute shots that I can control, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the job done this time. But I am so stoked to have shot 60 on the PGA Tour.\"Over at La Quinta Country Club, Andrew Putnam matched Brown with a 12-under 60 to tie the course record, but he likewise couldn't make a birdie on his final hole to shoot 59. Putnam's 60 came after a lackluster 72 on Thursday, moving him up 114 spots into the top 20 of the leaderboard.\nBrown's 60 vaulted him 50 spots and into a share of the lead with Scheffler heading into the weekend. Like Scheffler, he'll play his third round on the tougher Stadium Course before the 54-hole cut gets made and everyone finishes on Pete Dye's test in the desert. LeadersT1. Scottie Scheffler, Blades Brown (-17): With a 54-hole cut, we won't see repairings until Sunday, which means Scheffler and Brown won't play together on Moving Day. Perhaps that could help young Brown, who will get at least an extra day without the added stress and pressure of going toe-to-toe with the game's best golfer. It'll be hard to follow up his Friday 60, but he's in line for the best finish of his young career after making three cuts in eight starts in 2025 but failing to notch a top 25 finish. Scheffler, meanwhile, is looking to do something he's never done in his illustrious career to this point: win in one of his first five events of the season. If anyone is built to continue going low at the Stadium Course, it's Scheffler, and he'll have his eyes on a wire-to-wire victory to open his 2026 campaign. \nContenders3. Si Woo Kim (-16)T4. S.H. Kim, Matt McCarty (-15)T6. Eric Cole, Rickie Fowler, Nico Echavarria, Wyndham Clark, Jacob Bridgeman, Nick Taylor (-14)T12. Russell Henley, Patrick Cantlay, Ben Griffin and three others (-13) While Kim did not post a 60, his 7-under effort on the Stadium Course was wildly impressive to keep pace with Scheffler before he gets a crack at La Quinta Country Club on Saturday. Clark's 64 at the Stadium Course was the low round of the day there, as he climbed into the top 10 and will likewise move to La Quinta CC to try and make up more ground in the third round. Beyond those two, multiple heavy-hitters are lurking in the top 20 with Fowler, Griffin, Henley and Cantlay all plodding along nicely to give themselves a look going into the weekend. \nIf the wind stays light all weekend, there will be more scores in the low 60s, and players will have plenty of opportunities to make big moves up the leaderboard. The challenge for all of them is the name at the top as Scheffler gets to enjoy those conditions like the rest, and he's a hard man to catch. With just about any other player in the lead, this would still feel like a wide-open tournament given what's possible on these courses, but Scheffler's presence makes it far more unlikely he creates a big opening for those well back in the pack. That said, we saw that a 59 could be in the cards this week, and for those who still have a crack at La Quinta CC or the Nicklaus Tournament Course on Saturday, they'll have visions of a similar move to what we saw from Brown and Putnam on Friday. Finishing in styleTony Finau hasn't had the scoring gear needed to contend so far this week, but he gave himself a boost going into the weekend with his approach on his final hole on Friday, holing out from the fairway with a wedge for eagle on No. 9 on the Nicklaus Tournament Course.\nThat moved him to 8 under for the tournament and into T61 going into Saturday. With the cut still to be settled, Finau's eagle to close out his second round could prove very important to his chances of getting a Sunday tee time. 2026 American Express updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookScottie Scheffler (+134)Si Woo Kim (+410)Ben Griffin (+1450)Wyndham Clark (+1650)Patrick Cantlay (+1850)Blades Brown (+1950)Jacob Bridgeman (+2100)With scoring this good and a leaderboard this crowded, you want to take a few swings at some longer shots -- especially those who get another round not on the Stadium Course. At the same time, with Scheffler in first, you probably don't want to get overly aggressive in adding positions outside of Scottie. Clark is particularly interesting given he gets La Quinta CC and appears to be in much better form to start 2026 than we saw from him in 2025. He's a guy that can go low and his low round of the week so far is on the Stadium Course, which means he should have plenty of confidence on Sunday if he gets into a position to contend. I also wouldn't hate a nibble at Sam Burns further down the board at 92-1. He's just five shots back and has been known to get red-hot with the putter and post some really low scores. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE --Conversations between the Milwaukee Bucks and superstar big man Giannis Antetokounmpo about his future have \"intensified in nature\" recently, according to Shams Charania, who added in a report on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" Friday that the \"tension\" in the organization and the locker room is at \"an all-time high.\"The Bucks have lost five of their last seven games to fall to 18-25 on the season, which has them in 11th place in the Eastern Conference -- just outside of even the final Play-In Tournament spot. After a 20-point loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, Antetokounmpo called out his teammates for being \"selfish\" and \"not playing hard.\"Earlier in the week, following the Bucks' narrow win over the Atlanta Hawks, Antetokounmpo was asked if he would finish the season with the team. \"I don't know. I take it day-by-day,\" he said. Those comments came just weeks after Antetokounmpo told Sam Amick of The Athletic that he would \"never\" ask the Bucks to trade him. \n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo calls out teammates after 122-102 loss to Thunder\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe uptick in Antetokounmpo trade rumors combined with a string of bad losses -- their last three defeats were all by at least 18 points -- has created some terrible vibes in Milwaukee. Here's more from Charania on what's going on internally in Milwaukee ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline:\n\"Giannis and the Bucks, they've been having ongoing conversations about his future, even going back to May... Those conversations have only grown with every passing week and month since May. Recently, the Bucks and Giannis' conversations have intensified in nature. He made some comments after their game on Wednesday -- they've had some big blowout losses recently and they got blown out on our airwaves at ESPN against the Oklahoma City Thunder and he came out and absolutely went off on his team. These were very uncharacteristic comments from Giannis Antetokounmpo. We know also about a week ago, the fans in Milwaukee were booing him and the team when they were playing, and he booed them back. That is also something we have not seen from Giannis and the Bucks fans is the booing. \"His comments after the game, the frustration that Giannis Antetokounmpo has is at an all-time high. He's frustrated with the losing, he's frustrated with the situation. And I will say this: I've spoken to about a dozen sources on-and-off for weeks now and the tension that's in the air within that organization, in that locker room, its at an all-time high. There's something of a splintering environment going on there, because when a player of Giannis' caliber maybe he has a wandering eye  or maybe doesn't know what his future holds there and is having these intense conversations with the organization about what that looks like, there's gonna be such high levels and degrees of uncertainty within that organization. \"Again, it's been going on all year, but I just think back to the summer. Late July, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Bucks general manager Jon Horst are meeting face-to-face. Jon Horst and the Bucks, Doc Rivers and the ownership, they're selling Giannis Antetokounmpo on competing for a championship. Like, 'we have a title-contending roster.' Giannis makes it very clear that he has concerns, he has issues with the roster, that he maybe doesn't believe that this is truly a contending team. That leads to conversations with the Knicks. That's a preferred destination that he had in the offseason. Those teams spoke, there were offers made. Obviously there was no deal that happened. The Bucks ended up signing his brother Thanasis, he ends committing to the season and he ends up starting the year there. \"Everything about Giannis' brand has been loyalty. He's spent 13 years in Milwaukee. He loves the city, he loves the organization, but what I've been hearing over and over for months now is that the writing is on the wall for Giannis and the Bucks. It's just how do they get there, when do they get there? And really, when is either side ready to step up to the plate and have that level of understanding? Or will it continue to live in this nebulus state of 'will they or won't they,' 'will he or won't he,' and that has a direct impact on the team and how the performance is.\"Antetokounmpo's comments about his teammates after the defeat to the Thunder were an escalation, and made it clear that his frustration with the situation in Milwaukee is growing. It's also worth noting that he only took 11 shots against the Thunder, and has taken 13 or fewer shots in five of the team's last six games. Antetokounmpo's annoyance and the team's recent skid do not guarantee that he'll be gone by the NBA's Feb. 5 trade deadline, however. He is under contract through 2027, and even if it's hard to imagine him committing his long-term future to the Bucks, the team is not under pressure to trade him right now. In fact, there have been plenty of reports in recent weeks that the Bucks are actually looking to add talent ahead of the deadline to give themselves a chance to compete in a weakened East. Whatever happens, the entire league will be waiting with bated breath. \n\"Giannis is the trade deadline,\" Brian Windhorst said earlier this week. \"There is really not a lot of other players out there that can move the needle. There is very small to no market for Ja Morant or Anthony Davis. The entire league is watching Giannis.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Patience has become a virtue for Michigan State. The No. 10-ranked Spartans are in the thick of another Big Ten Title race on the backs of elite player development. Senior forward Jaxon Kohler has transformed into an All-Conference-caliber big man and is playing the best basketball of his life. Redshirt-sophomore point guard Jeremy Fears Jr. and senior center Carson Cooper are also massive player-development wins for Tom Izzo. Kohler, Fears and Cooper are at the epicenter of Michigan State's glitzy 17-2 record, including a 7-1 mark in Big Ten play. Michigan State is fresh off a 2-0 West Coast roadtrip, but that body-clock adjustment is always a concern for coaches. Four days should be enough to get back up to speed, but it's a factor entering Saturday's action.  If Michigan State wants to put another Big Ten Championship banner on the board, it has to avoid a letdown against a wounded, undermanned Maryland squad. The Terps (8-11, 1-7 in Big Ten play) will still not have star big man Pharrel Payne, who is still on the mend after a gruesome knee injury suffered against Michigan last month. Payne is not expected to play this season, but the brutal Big Ten bouts keep coming for first-year Maryland coach Buzz Williams.  Where to watch Michigan State vs. Maryland live Date: Saturday, Jan. 24 | Time: 12 p.m. ET Location: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, Michigan TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Michigan State vs. Maryland: Need to knows Jeremy Fears Jr. versus Diggy Coit: Coit has been one of the top isolation scorers in the country, and he dropped 43 (!) points on Penn State last Sunday. The 5-foot-11 assassin has the speed and craftiness to get to his pull-up jumper whenever he wants, but Michigan State's team defense is excellent. The Spartans load up the gaps and limit driving lines as well as any team in the league, but this is also another opportunity for Jeremy Fears Jr. to add to his Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year resume.  \nHow will Michigan State navigate the Terps' zone? Maryland has been playing a lot of zone lately. The results haven't been great, but Williams might not have much of a choice in this matchup. Oregon and Duke have used zone defense to gum up the game and frustrate this Michigan State halfcourt offense. Maryland's zone defense isn't that good, but it does coax a trey at a 58% clip. Michigan State has a couple capable shooters, but that's not the name of the game for the Spartans, especially when Coen Carr, Jeremy Fears Jr. and Carson Cooper are on the floor together. Michigan State has to find better solutions against zone defenses, but I could easily see Fears still getting into the teeth of the defense and that's when Michigan State gets so scary. Maryland's transition defense will be strained: Relentless offensive rebounding is a tenet of Buzz Ball. Maryland will send four to the offensive glass at times, but that leaves its transition defense in some bad spots. Michigan State is an elite rebounding team and equally as dominant in transition. Maryland cannot be reckless, or we will have a Flying Carr sighting at the Breslin.  \n Michigan State vs. Maryland prediction, picks You aren't going to out-physical Michigan State, but Maryland certainly will try. Even without Pharrel Payne, Maryland has the athletes to match Michigan State's frontcourt thumpers. Solomon Washington and Elijah Saunders are weight-room warriors who will not be overwhelmed by Michigan State's awesome frontcourt duo of Jaxon Kohler and Carson Cooper. Michigan State has schematic edges all over the place because Maryland's offense goes haywire when Coit isn't Coit-ing, but the Terps have the athleticism to not get totally abused on the glass and stay inside this hefty spread. Pick: Maryland +18.5 \n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -18.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Maryland\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        \r\n\tSan Diego State will be looking to get back on track Saturday, when it travels to UNLV for a clash between a pair of the Mountain West's top teams on CBS. The Aztecs (15-5, 7-1) remain alone atop the conference standings after falling at Grand Canyon on Wednesday, but the loss inflicted some damage to the Aztecs' at-large aspirations for the NCAA Tournament. \r\n\r\n\r\nBeating the Runnin' Rebels (10-8, 5-2) would help get the repair started. UNLV enters on a three-game winning streak that includes a massive 86-76 win over Utah State on Tuesday night. That was a head-turning result in the Mountain West which proved once again just how dangerous UNLV is under first-year coach Josh Pastner. \r\n\r\n\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: No. 2 seeds Houston, UConn, Purdue, Iowa State ready to move up if teams on top line go down\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\r\nWhile his debut campaign has featured a few bad losses, the Rebels also own victories over Memphis and Stanford. UNLV atones for being one of the nation's worst 3-point shooting teams by relentlessly attacking the basket and shooting 26.6 free throws per game, which ranks No. 13 nationally. \r\n\r\n\r\nSan Diego State counters with its vintage strong defense and a balanced offensive attack. Looming large for SDSU is uncertainty around the status of center Magoon Gwath. The seven-footer missed the Grand Canyon amid a hip issue, and his status will be a key issue for the Aztecs both in this game and beyond. \r\n\n\r\n  Where to watch San Diego State vs. UNLV live   \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDate: Saturday, January 24 | Time: 4 p.m. ET\r\n Location: Thomas & Mack Center -- Las Vegas\r\n TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App \r\n\n\tStreaming on Paramount+ PremiumLive stream: fubo (Try for free)\r\n\r\n San Diego State vs. UNLV: Need to know \r\n\r\n\r\n\tInside the arc: If you're a fan of the 3-pointer, this isn't the game for you. UNLV and San Diego State rank 285th and 310th, respectively, in 3-point attempts per game. The Runnin' Rebels make just 31.4% of their attempts and have hit more than 10 in a game just once this season. SDSU makes a highly respectable 36.7% of its 3-pointers but is coming off a 3 for 18 performance from deep in Wednesday's loss at Grand Canyon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMountain West menace: UNLV guard Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn is emerging as one of the Mountain West's most potent scorers. The Illinois transfer finished with 21 points on 8 of 12 shooting in the Runnin' Rebels' 86-76 win at Utah State on Tuesday. That followed a 33-point outburst in a win over Boise State on Jan. 13. Against league foes he is averaging 18.1 points, and he's reached double figures in all but one game this season. Gibbs-Lawhorn has some variety in his arsenal as he inflicts damage as both a spot-up shooter and ball-handler. At just 6-foot-1, he's also been solid at the rim. \r\n\n\r\n\tSan Diego State's resume: San Diego State enters on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble in CBS Sports Bracketology and is expected to stay there even with a win. However, our long-term forecast projects the Aztecs to ultimately make the bracket as a No. 11 seed. For now, SDSU's resume is a bit chaotic and dragged down by a Quad 3 November home loss to Troy. While the Aztecs do own a Quad 1 road win over Nevada from Jan. 6, they'll need to add more in order to finish on the right side of the bubble. The most significant opportunities still ahead are road games against Utah State (Jan. 31) and New Mexico (Feb. 28).  \r\n\r\n\r\n San Diego State vs. UNLV prediction, picks \r\n\n\r\nSan Diego State plays a style of defense designed to tempt you into shooting 3-pointers. That could be a problem for UNLV, which does not take or make many shots from beyond the arc. The Runnin' Rebels prefer to attack, get fouled and shoot free throws. Provided the Aztecs make enough shots of their own and prevent UNLV from running in transition, they should be able to dictate the game's flow on the defensive end. SDSU is also going to be motivated to seek redemption following a deflating 1-point loss at Grand Canyon on Wednesday night that ended its perfect start to Mountain West play. Pick: San Diego State -5.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSDSU -5.5\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UNLV\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UNLV\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSTRAIGHT-UP\r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\t\t\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \r\n\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama center Charles Bediako will play against Tennessee on Saturday, coach Nate Oats announced Friday ahead of the SEC clash. Bediako sued the NCAA in a Tuscaloosa, Alabama, court earlier this week, seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction that would allow him to play for the Crimson Tide while awaiting a permanent ruling from the court.Bediako was given the green light to return to college basketball the day after filing the temporary restraining order.\"On the Tennessee game, listen, I know Charles will draw a lot of attention for this game, but we are going to play him,\" Oats said.  \"He's eligible to play. We're going to follow the court orders.\"Oats defended the decision to play Bediako despite him declaring for the NBA Draft in 2023 and playing professionally in the G League the last three seasons. Oats said the \"system's clearly broken\" and that he is trying to find a way to \"fix it.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Charles Bediako's case could crater college hoops; inside Virginia's rapid rise\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I am all for figuring out a way to fix it,\" Oats said. \"But since the NCAA has already allowed professionals to play on virtually every team we've played this year, or will play has a former professional player on their roster, you tell me how I am supposed to tell Charles and the team that we're not going to support him when he's been deemed legally eligible to play. ... We've got a roster spot open so this is not taking any opportunities away from a high school recruit or anybody else. Charles should not be punished for choosing to go the academic route out of high school instead of the professional route like the international players did.\"Bediako hasn't played college basketball since the 2022-23 season, where he played a key role in Alabama earning the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament. The Alabama big man started all 37 games during his final college season and averaged 6.4 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 20.8 minutes per game. His final appearance for Alabama came in a Sweet 16 loss to San Diego State in the 2023 NCAA Tournament.Bediako had two years of eligibility remaining but declared for the 2023 NBA Draft. He was not selected but signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs and briefly played for the Austin Spurs, San Antonio's G League affiliate. Since then, he suited up for two other G League teams -- the Grand Rapids Gold and, most recently, the Motor City Cruise. \nSince Bediako enrolled in Alabama in 2021, he is still within his five-year eligibility clock, but the NCAA announced Tuesday a stiff pushback to Bediako's eligibility claim. After talking with members of the National Association of Basketball Coaches on Friday, Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's NCAA's senior vice president of basketball, issued a statement Friday afternoon laying out the NCAA's established eligibility rules for players entering the NBA Draft.     \"If these rules surrounding the NCAA pre- and post-draft rules cannot be enforced, it would create an unstable environment for the student-athletes, schools building a roster for the following season and the NBA,\" Gavitt said.\nHis return has also drawn criticism from across the SEC, including from Florida coach Todd Golden.\n\n        \n            \n                Florida's Todd Golden sounds off on Charles Bediako's potential return to Alabama: 'We'll beat them anyway'\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Mr. Bediako signed three NBA contracts after competing in college for two seasons. The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any prospective or returning student-athletes who have signed an NBA contract,\" the NCAA said. \"Eligibility rules ensure high school students get a shot at earning scholarships, and we will continue to consistently apply and defend these rules.\"Bediako re-enrolled at Alabama for the spring semester and will be eligible to play until Jan. 27, when he has his next court hearing for a preliminary injunction. Notably, Alabama only has one game until that date. The Crimson Tide are set to face Missouri on Jan. 27.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Bama247.com features the best team and recruiting coverage of the Crimson Tide in the Alabama market.

    "body": "\n        Conference championship Sunday is nearly upon us. We're now just two days away from finding out what the Super Bowl LX matchup will be to close the 2025 season. After 272 regular-season games and 10 playoff contests, only three games remain before we crown an NFL champion. With a trip to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on the line, health -- as it always does in football -- will play a massive role in determining the outcomes of both the AFC Championship Game between the second-seeded New England Patriots and the top-seeded Denver Broncos and the NFC Championship Game between the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Rams and the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks.It's already known that the Broncos will be without starting quarterback Bo Nix after he broke a bone in his ankle during their divisional-round victory over the Buffalo Bills, and that the Seahawks will be without running back Zach Charbonnet after he tore his ACL in a divisional-round blowout over the San Francisco 49ers.Now that the final injury reports have been released for each of the NFL's final four teams, here's who is ruled out and who still has a chance to play Sunday.New England Patriots (-4.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nTEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSPatriotsHarold Landry IIILBKneeOutMarte MapuLBHipQuestionableCarlton Davis IIICBConcussion protocolQuestionableMack HollinsWRAbdomenQuestionableBroncosBo NixQBAnkleOutJ.K. DobbinsRBFootOutDrew SandersLBAnkleOutLucas KrullTEFootOutLuke WattenbergCShoulderQuestionableAlex ForsythCAnkleQuestionableTroy FranklinWRHamstringQuestionableJL SkinnerSQuadQuestionableThe Patriots suffered a major blow Friday when the team ruled out 2025 sacks leader Harold Landry III (knee). Landry, who posted a team-high 8.5 sacks during the regular season, didn't practice all week, leading to him not suiting up in Denver on Sunday. Starting outside cornerback Carlton Davis III (concussion protocol) is questionable after being a limited participant Wednesday and Thursday before practicing fully Friday. Linebacker Marte Mapu (hip) is also questionable after missing practice Wednesday and Thursday and then being limited Friday.The Broncos are, of course, without quarterback Bo Nix (ankle), who is done for the season. Running back J.K. Dobbins (foot), who has been out since Week 10, practiced as a limited participant all week, but the Broncos decided he wasn't ready to return. Starting center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) appears poised to play Sunday after practicing fully all week and is listed as questionable. Center Alex Forsyth (ankle), his fill-in, was limited all week and is also questionable. Wide receiver Troy Franklin (hamstring) was limited throughout the week as well, leaving him questionable, too.\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSRamsRob HavensteinOTAnkleOutByron YoungLBKneeQuestionableSeahawksChazz SurrattLBAnkleOutAmari KightOTKneeDoubtfulJosh JonesOLKnee/AnkleQuestionableRobbie OuztsFBNeckQuestionableThe Rams ruled out just one player, offensive tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle), after he was a limited practice participant Thursday and Friday. The only player listed as questionable for the Rams is edge rusher Byron Young (knee). He didn't practice Wednesday or Thursday but was limited Friday. That's a significant question mark given the Pro Bowl pass rusher led Los Angeles with 12.0 sacks during the regular season.\nLast week, Seahawks Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold was listed as questionable for the divisional round with an oblique injury, but he ended up starting and throwing for 124 yards and a touchdown on 12 of 17 passing. For the NFC Championship Game this week, Darnold is off the final injury report and carries no game status, meaning he's good to go. Seattle did rule out linebacker Chazz Surratt (ankle) despite him practicing fully all week. Offensive tackle Amari Kight (knee) is doubtful, and swing lineman Josh Jones (knee/ankle) is questionable.\n            ",

Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams, with both conference championship games taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the Championship Round NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are now 3.5-point home underdogs to utilize in NFL picks after opening at -5.5.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with that NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. Thus, there is a lot to consider before making any NFL playoffs bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (42.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under (-105) using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

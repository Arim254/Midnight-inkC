    "body": "\n        Hugo Ekitike is in contention to return to what Arne Slot suggested would be a strong Liverpool squad that take on Barnsley in the FA Cup third round on Monday night. Ekitike missed draws against Fulham and Arsenal with what his manager termed a minor hamstring issue, forcing the Reds to field what looked like dramatically weakened attacks given the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak.Ekitike has been one of the best performers in a disappointing season for Liverpool so far and his return will be a welcome one. Asked if anyone would be available for the visit of League One opposition to Anfield, Slot immediately namechecked Ekitike, though he added, \"That's not 100% sure, but we will do everything to have him available on Monday.\"Wataru Endo is also due to return to training, strengthening Liverpool's defensive options at a time when they are fearing the worst over what looked to be a serious knee injury for Conor Bradley at Arsenal on Thursday night. Of Japan international Endo, Slot said, \"If I'm correct, he might start to train one of these days, but he's been out for two months now. That's, of course different than being out for one week [like Ekitike has been].\"Federico Chiesa is another one whose role will be under consideration, particularly with Salah still at the Africa Cup of Nations as Egypt advanced to the semifinals on Saturday. Despite the absence of Salah and Isak, Chiesa has not seen his game time dramatically expanded in recent weeks, a rare start against Wolves on December 27 the first time he has played over an hour for Liverpool this season. Slot, however, gave an indication that the Italy international was happy with his game time.\n\"I spoke to him two days ago and he said to me that he played more in the recent weeks than he ever did before under me,\" Slot said. \"He is one of the players that could feature in that game, definitely. But like I said, Hugo might be back, so let's see how we will start that game. He's one of the options that I have.\"Whatever the exact nature of the XI, Slot has indicated he will name a strong side for Monday night's game, which comes against an opponent who currently sit 17th in the League One standings. Still, Barnsley have overcome the odds at Anfield before, the last meeting between these two sides seeing Rafa Benitez's Reds dumped out in the fifth round in 2008 in dramatic fashion. Slot may be relatively new to the English game, but he has already learned the hard way the risk of undervaluing opposition in the FA Cup.\nAs they competed on four fronts last season, Slot opted to make 10 changes to his side for the fourth round against struggling Plymouth Argyle, the game falling just three days before the Merseyside derby. The gamble backfired spectacularly as Ryan Hardie's second half penalty earned Argyle a famous underdog win. This time it appears that the Dutchman is not prepared to play too fast and loose with what might be Liverpool's best chance of silverware this season.\"Last season I made the decision that some players needed to rest in the FA Cup because you cannot play every player every single time,\" Slot said. \"It's obvious that we're not in the League Cup anymore and the FA Cup has always been very important for us. Sometimes in a season where you are still competing for the League Cup, for the Champions League and the league, with the amount of players we had last season and have this season, you have to make choices. \"I can guarantee you that on Monday you will see all the players you saw against Arsenal maybe with some substitutions but then they will be on the bench. That's going to be different than last season against Plymouth.\"\nViewing information: Liverpool vs. BarnsleyDate: Monday, Jan. 12 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, United KingdomTV: ESPN SelectOdds: Liverpool -600; Draw +600; Barnsley +1100\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs roll on Sunday with three more games -- Jaguars vs. Bills (+1.5), 49ers vs. Eagles (-6) and Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5). A majority of the daily Fantasy football action will take all three games into account for the 'main slate.' It's a smaller NFL DFS player pool on Sunday than the regular season, but larger than Saturday and Monday during Wild Card Weekend, so there are some tougher calls to make for NFL DFS lineups.How should you value big names like Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, Christian McCaffrey, James Cook and Justin Herbert, and who are the NFL DFS picks who can be sleepers for this slate? Before making any Sunday NFL DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Hurts as an anytime TD scorer (+105) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Wild Card Sunday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Wild Card SundayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Sunday is Eagles running back Saquon Barkley at $8,500 on FanDuel and $7,000 on DraftKings. Barkley had an epic playoff run last year, leading the NFL with 499 rushing yards as he averaged 124.8 yards on the ground over the course of four games. That effort was highlighted by a 205-yard game against the Rams. The Niners were below average defending running backs this season, giving up the 19th-most Fantasy points to opposing backs. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Barkley to go Over 82.5 rushing yards at DraftKings Sportsbook:\nMcClure is also building around Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid ($3,800 on DraftKings, $5,100 on FanDuel), who gets a very favorable matchup against the Jags, a team that has allowed the 22nd-most points to opposing tight ends. With injuries playing a factor, Kincaid's total targets and receptions have been down a bit this season, but he's been more efficient than ever. He averaged a cater-high 14.6 yards per catch and scored a career-high five touchdowns this season. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Kincaid to go Over 41.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Wild Card Sunday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are set, and teams like the Texans and Jaguars enter in on win streaks of nine and eight games, respectively, and could be highly sought after with NFL picks. Meanwhile, Green Bay is riding a four-game losing streak and is a 2.5-point favorite against the Bears on Saturday night, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds. Those two split their regular season matchups as they'll tangle in the postseason for just the third time ever. The NFL line for that game matches Bills vs. Jaguars (-1.5) as the slimmest of the Wild Card Weekend NFL spreads, while the largest has the Rams favored by 10 points over the Panthers as Los Angeles is getting receiver Davante Adams (hamstring) back for the first time in nearly a month. Other spreads include 49ers vs. Eagles (-6), Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5) and Steelers vs. Texans (-3). The Jaguars opened as underdogs, but have flipped to slight favorites, joining the Eagles and Patriots as the home favorites of the opening round of the 2026 NFL playoffs. All of the updated Wild Card Weekend NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Wild Card Weekend NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

Head here to see every pick. Top Wild Card Weekend NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Wild Card Weekend NFL picks is the Steelers (+3, 38.5) covering at Houston on Monday night at 8 p.m. ET. These teams have the same 9-8 spread record, but Pittsburgh is 4-1 ATS over its last five, while Houston has failed to cover in two of its last three. While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss. The Steelers are forecasted to cover over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Wild Card NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule and just revealed three teams projected to outright win over 60% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday.

Schröder ended up signing a one-year, $5.9 million taxpayer mid-level exception contract with the Boston Celtics instead.\nVideo appeared to show Schröder telling Dončić, \"I'm gonna beat the s--- out of you.\"According to senior NBA Insider for NBA on Prime, Chris Haynes, Dončić was the player Schröder confronted after the game. Dončić ended the game with 34 points, five rebounds and seven assists to Schröder's 11 points, two rebounds and seven assists.\nSchröder will miss games with the Houston Rockets, New York Knicks, and, in no surprise, the Lakers. The Kings are currently 8-30 and in last place in the Western Conference, well behind the fifth-place Lakers, who sit at 23-13.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Cubs have landed one of the offseason's top free agents. The Cubs and third baseman Alex Bregman have agreed to a five-year contract worth $175 million, reports ESPN. The deal does not include any opt outs. Bregman opted out of the final two years and $80 million remaining on his contract with the Boston Red Sox to enter free agency. Bregman, 31, hit .273/.360/.462 with 18 home runs in 114 games around a quad injury in 2025. He did not perform as well after the injury, it should be noted. Bregman put up a .938 OPS in 52 games before the injury and a .724 OPS in 63 games after the injury. Clearly, the Cubs don't see that as a worrisome sign of decline. Bregman played his typically strong defense all year. We ranked Bregman as the second-best free agent available this offseason, behind only Kyle Tucker. Here's the write-up: Bregman, one of the last notable free agents to sign last winter, showed no ill effects of being left in the cold. He kept alive his streak of having never finished worse than 15% above the league-average hitter, and for the first time in his career, he joined the 90-90 club -- that is, a 90% in-zone contact rate and a 90 mph average exit velocity. Bregman can still pick it at third base, too. It's fair to wonder how his pull-happy slugging would play in a less favorable home offensive environment than the ones he's haunted to date, but he's a good player who ought to land a better contract than three years and $120 million this go around. \tRookie Matt Shaw was Chicago's primary third baseman last year and he put together a league average-ish season at the plate while playing strong enough defense to be a Gold Glove finalist. With Dansby Swanson and Nico Hoerner entrenched as the double play combination, the Cubs now have too many infielders. Hoerner, a free agent after 2026, has drawn significant trade interest.\nThe Bregman signing comes a few days after the Cubs boosted their rotation by acquiring right-hander Edward Cabrera from the Miami Marlins for three prospects, including touted outfielder Owen Caissie. Earlier this offseason, they supplemented the bullpen with lower cost free agents Hunter Harvey, Phil Maton, Hoby Milner, and Jacob Webb.As for the Red Sox, adding an infielder was a priority coming into the offseason and re-signing Bregman would have been the most straightforward move. They can bring in a second or third baseman and play young Marcelo Mayer at the other position. Boston traded for Willson Contreras last month to serve as a righty power bat.Because he received (and rejected) the qualifying offer last offseason, Bregman was not eligible to receive it again this offseason. The Red Sox will not receive a compensation 2026 draft pick for losing him and the Cubs will not have to forfeit any 2026 draft picks for signing him, which added to Bregman's appeal. \nThe Cubs went 92-70 in 2026 and defeated the San Diego Padres in the Wild Card Series. They were eliminated by the division rival Milwaukee Brewers in five games in the NLDS.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the fourth consecutive time, the Supercopa de España will come down to an El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona took down Athletic Club in a 5-0 rout in the semifinals while Real Madrid squeezed by Atletico Madrid by a 2-1 score in Xabi Alonso's first season as manager of the club. He'll now have a chance to win his first trophy, and it could be a significant one.The last four winners of the Supercopa de España have then gone on to win LaLiga at the end of the season, so while Barcelona have a four-point lead domestically, Real Madrid triumphing on Sunday could deal a psychological blow to Hansi Flick's side. Each Clásico is a compelling installment in this rivalry, and the latest could be one that defines the season. Let's take a look at some things to watch during the match:How to watch Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Sunday, Jan. 11 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: Alinma Bank Stadium at King Abdullah Sport City -- Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Barcelona -105; Draw +290; Real Madrid +250Predicted linuepsGiven injuries, there will be plenty of decisions for both coaches, but the biggest is whether Kylian Mbappe will play as he suffers from a knee injury. Odds are that he won't, but with this being a final versus a rival, Alosno could push to have his strongest side available. Barcelona: Joan Garcia, Alejandro Balde, Pau Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Jules Kounde, Frenkie De Jong, Pedri, Lamine Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha, Ferran TorresReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Álvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen, Raul Ascencio, Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Vinícius Júnior, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, Gonzalo García\nRodrygo is neededKylian Mbappe is going to be brought to Saudi Arabia for the final as the French forward deals with a knee injury, but that doesn't mean he'll feature in the final. Even if it's for gamesmanship, it's good to have Mbappe in Saudi Arabia just to give Flick something to think about, but Gonzalo Garcia has shown that he can lead the line in a pinch, and someone who stepped up in the Madrid derby was Rodrygo. The Brazilian winger has been linked with a move away from the club since Alonso took over, but with a trophy on the line, it was Rodrygo who got the eventual winning goal.He's made the most of limited minutes, and there's still a major role for him to play in the Real Madrid XI, especially in a rivalry match of this magnitude. He only has three goals and six assists in all competitions this season, but cups have been when Rodrygo has shined, scoring twice and assisting two more goals in only six appearances between the Supercopa de España, Copa Del Rey, and Champions League play.Joan Garcia to win the battle of the keepers?Barcelona keeper Joan Garcia crossed rivalry lines, joining from Espanyol to be the number one between the sticks at Barca this past summer. After defeating Athletic Club, he's now kept clean sheets in four consecutive matches and has been able to steady their high-wire attack. Barcelona's high line will leave a keeper isolated, and Garcia's reflexes help make Flick's high line work. But in this final, he'll duel with Thibaut Courtois. The Real Madrid keeper may be 33 now, but he still hasn't lost a step in top-class shootouts. The Belgian has ensured for years that even when Real Madrid's defense bends that it doesn't break, and with Barcelona looking to enter their next era of great keepers with Marc-Andre ter Stegen not being able to stay on the pitch consistently due to injuries, Garcia will need to outduel his counterpart.\nCan anyone stop Raphinha?Real Madrid were lucky not to be overrun by Atletico Madrid, and allowing similar chances to Barcelona would see them lose this match. Facing Athletic Club, Barcelona were able to open a four-goal lead by halftime while Raphinha netted a brace. Flick was able to rotate the squad with Lamine Yamal and Dani Olmo coming off the bench, while Robert Lewandowski was an unused sub. Facing Real Madrid, they'll fully be involved, and it's something that could cause nightmares for what's left of Alonso's defense. Due to injuries, Antonio Rüdiger had to start in the semifinals, which is something that Barcelona will look to take advantage of. Federico Valverde also had to play out of position at right back. He has the work rate for the position, but these are areas that Barcelona will target and could be pivotal to who will come out on top.\n            ",

That means they'll be wearing their Navy jersey with their Navy pants. It's a combination that the Bears have only worn six times in franchise history and they've gone 0-6 in those games, including 0-4 against the Packers. First, let's take a look at the threads. \nThe Bears played eight home games during the regular season and they wore the same thing in each game: Their Navy jersey with white pants. The all-Navy look that they'll be wearing on Saturday night will mark the first time in three years that they've gone with their Navy jersey combined with their Navy Pants. \nThe Bears first wore the all-Navy look in 2002 and here's how their six games have gone in the uniforms over the past 23 years:  2002 (Week 5): Packers 34-21 over Bears2006 (Week 17): Packers 26-7 over Bears2016 (Week 7): Packers 26-10 over Bears2017 (Week 1): Falcons 23-17 over Bears2017 (Week 4): Packers 35-14 over Bears2022 (Week 18: Vikings 29-13 over BearsNot only are the Bears 0-6, but they've lost those six games by an average of 15.2 points per game. \nThe Bears are facing the Packers in a postseason game for the third time in franchise history. Despite playing at home, Chicago is going into the game as a 2.5-point underdog. The Bears haven't won a playoff game since the 2010 season, which is tied for the third-longest drought in the NFL, and for some reason, they've decided to try and end that drought by wearing a uniform combination that they've never won in. \n            \n    ",

In the second game, the Bears stormed back from an 18-point halftime deficit to stun the Packers, 31-27. Caleb Williams threw a 25-yard scoring pass with just under two minutes left to play for the game-winning score. The win for the Bears was the largest postseason comeback in franchise history. It was also the third-largest fourth quarter comeback in NFL playoff history. The action will continue on Sunday with a tripleheader that will kickoff with the Jaguars hosting the Bills at 1 p.m. ET on CBS.With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line.

The third round has had a bit of everything so far, with four games going to penalties to determine a winner, and plenty of matches have seen goals galore. Let's take a look at what has happened in the FA Cup so far:FA Cup third round scoresMK Dons 1, Oxford United 1 (Oxford United advance 4-3 on penalties)Preston North End 0, Wigan Athletic 1Wrexham 3, Nottingham Forest 3 (Wrexham advance 4-3 on penalties)Port Vale 1, Fleetwood Town 0Macclesfield 2, Crystal Palace 1Everton 1, Sunderland 1 (Sunderland Advance 3-0 on penalties)Wolverhampton 6, Shrewsbury Town 1Cheltenham 0, Leicester City 2Doncaster Rovers 2, Southampton 3Stoke City 1, Coventry City 0Sheffield Wednesday 0, Brentford 2Newcastle United 3, Bournemouth 3 (Newcastle advance 7-6 on penalties)Fulham 3, Middlesbrough 1Ipswich Town 2, Blackpool 1Manchester City 10, Exeter City 1Burnley 5, Millwall 1Boreham Wood 0, Burton Albion 5Cambridge United 2, Birmingham City 3Tottenham 1, Aston Villa 2Grimbsby Town 3, Weston-super-Mare 2Bristol City 5, Watford 1Charlton 1, Chelsea 5A cupset for the agesThe magic of the FA Cup is always in full swing, but Saturday brought something special even by FA Cup standards. Non-league Macclesfield, who are 117 places below Crystal Palace, became the first non-league team to knock out the FA Cup holders since Palace did it themselves, knocking out Wolverhampton in the 1908-09 first round. Macclesfield are led by John Rooney, the younger brother of Wayne Rooney, and they took control of the match, scoring twice by the 60th minute of play. It's one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history as Macclesfield will now go into the fourth round of play to see if they can keep this run going. Wayne Rooney was there doing coverage for the BBC and could be seen on the verge of tears seeing his brother accomplish history, and they shared an embrace following the match. Man City reach double digit goalsFacing Exeter City at home, Manchester City were expected to roll, but no one expected the show that came to the Etihad. Young defender Max Alleyne was just recalled from a loan to Watford due to an injury to Ruben Dias, and he only needed 12 minutes to find the back of the net for the first of many goals to come for Manchester City. They'd score four just in the first half alone before Antoine Semenyo scored the first goal of his City career in the second half of play. Rico Lewis netted a brace, and somehow, despite Erling Haaland starting the match, he didn't register a goal involvement. Looking at outfielders to start for Pep Guardiola's side, only three didn't have goal involvements during the match, as nearly everyone was involved in this FA Cup domination made an impact. Tottenham's woes continue Thomas Frank is under pressure in his first season as manager of Tottenham, and getting knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa won't do much to ease that. Tottenham have now failed to win in four consecutive matches, and extending things further, they've only won three matches out of their last 10 in all competitions. With Mohammed Kudus being the latest star sidelined for the club, it's becoming even harder for the attack to make things happen. Dominic Solanke's return to the squad could be a help to Frank's side, but they need more from the transfer market as the midfield is not good enough to keep up with a side marching toward the knockout stage of the Champions League. \nLiam Rosenior's first Chelsea winFacing a Championship side, it was expected for Chelsea to roll, and they did just that, defeating Charlton 5-1 on Saturday. It was the first game on the bench for new coach Liam Rosenior, and while they were playing a side a division below them, Chelsea controlled things from start to finish, only allowing six shots, with two of those being on target. The Blues held 74 percent of the possession, and Jorrel Hato opened the scoring in stoppage time of the first half before Chelsea scored four in the second half. With an EFL Cup semifinal on the horizon against Arsenal on Wednesday, this is a good chance for Rosenior to get that win out of the way before the level of difficulty increases for his side quickly in upcoming matches. Sunday's scheduleAll times Eastern\nDerby vs. Leeds, 7 a.m. Portsmouth vs. Arsenal, 9 a.m.Swansea City vs. West Brom, 9:30 a.m.West Ham vs. QPR, 9:30 a.m.Sheffield United vs.Mansfield Town, 9:30 a.m.Norwich vs. Walsall, 9:30 a.m.Hull vs. Blackburn, 9:30 a.m.Man United vs. Brighton, 11:30 a.m.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The former FC Dallas man collided with the post when scoring, with the club confirming a forearm fracture.\"The 23-year-old forward will undergo surgery [Sunday]. Pepi is expected to be sidelined for about two months,\" PSV posted on social media.This puts his status for the March international break's big games against Portugal and Belgium in the air, but these are games when Pepi will be needed. Any injury to players can potentially put their participation in the 2026 World Cup at risk. We're now only 152 days out from the World Cup kicking off in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which isn't very much time if an injury causes a player to miss a few months. Pepi's injury comes during a good run of form for the striker.\nThat goal was the fifth consecutive Eredivisie game that Pepi has scored in for PSV as he's pushing for a consistent starting role at the club while also solidifying his place as the number two striker for the USMNT behind Folarin Balogun. A strong change of pace option off the bench for the USMNT, Pepi now has 11 goals and two assists in 22 appearances for PSV in all competitions. He's been especially effective in Champions League play, where he has scored three goals and assisted one more in only 149 minutes of play.Despite that success, Pepi didn't see it translate to national team play during 2025. Only making one appearance for 15 minutes under Mauricio Pochettino, he's someone who has something to prove in these upcoming matches, which is where any kind of injury can be a concern. Pepi hasn't scored for the USMNT since November of 2024, but as one of the most talented young players in the pool, he'll be pushing for a spot at the World Cup if given opportunities to prove himself.\nAhead of the 2022 World Cup, Pepi left FC Dallas for FC Augsburg in a move that could not have gone worse, ultimately contributing to him missing out on the 2022 World Cup roster. During the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, Pepi played in 16 matches for the German club and failed to score. He regained his form at Groningen on loan in 2022-23, scoring 13 goals in 31 games before his move to PSV ahead of the 2023-24 season, averaging over double-digit goals each season since.\n            \n    ",

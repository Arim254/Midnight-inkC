Both Baltimore and Arizona have a league-high of six ATS home losses this year, perhaps, making them ones to fade with Week 16 NFL predictions.There are more road favorites than home teams giving points, according to the Week 16 NFL odds. Amongst those home dogs are Giants (+2.5) versus the Vikings, the Panthers (+2.5) against the Bucs and the Titans (+3.5) against a Chiefs squad that lost Patrick Mahomes to a torn ACL. All of the updated Week 16 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 16 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 16 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 16 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 16 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 16 NFL picks is that the Ravens (-2.5, 48.5) cover versus New England on Sunday night. Baltimore is coming off a dominant 24-0 win over Cincinnati, while the Patriots saw their 10-game win streak come to an end at the hands of Buffalo. The Pats have now dropped two of their last three versus the spread, as the team allowed season highs in points (35) and rushing yards (168) in the defeat to the Bills. Now, New England has to face the league's No. 3 rushing offense, led by Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson, and the quarterback has a stunning 16-0 regular season record in Week 15 or later. Baltimore is projected to rush for over 170 yards, which allows the Ravens to cover versus the spread 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Ravens using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 16 NFL predictions: the Chiefs (-3.5, 37.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. Patrick Mahomes' (torn ACL) injury shifted this line a full touchdown from Chiefs -10.5, but Kansas City still has a more complete team in just about all regards than Tennessee. While the Chiefs' No. 20 rushing offense isn't great, it's miles ahead of Tennessee's No. 30 ground attack. Then on defense, Kansas City boasts top 10 rankings in both points allowed and yards allowed, while the Titans rank in the bottom six in both categories. Tennessee is only 3-12 ATS over its last 15 home games and just allowed both its second-most total yards (430) and passing yards (292) of the year to San Fran on Sunday, so Gardner Minshew should be able to find success. The model also says the Under hits well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Chiefs to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 16 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 16 NFL schedule and just revealed four A-rated picks with the spread and total, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        The Houston Rockets came seconds away from a huge win on the road against the Denver Nuggets, but some officiating drama sent the game to overtime, where the Nuggets pulled out a 128-125 victory. The win kept Denver in second in the West, while the loss dropped Houston all the way to the fifth spot in the extremely competitive top of the standings. After the game, Rockets coach Ime Udoka got asked about the officiating and didn't hesitate to torch the crew of Zach Zarba (crew chief), Natalie Sago and JD Ralls. \"Just in general, I think as poorly officiated a game I've seen in a long time,\" Udoka said. \"Two have no business being out there and the crew chief was acting star struck. So, you're seeing all kinds of inconsistent calls and I'm sure we should've gotten a few more techs.\"There were a number of calls during the game that Udoka wasn't pleased with, but the most controversial one came in the closing seconds when Amen Thompson got called for a foul after he and Tim Hardaway Jr. got their legs tangled up. Udoka challenged the call, thinking surely it'd be overturned on review for incidental contact, but Zarba upheld the foul, citing contact between Thompson's shin and Hardaway's leg that caused him to go to the ground. \nThat gave Denver one free throw and the ball in a one-point game, with Jamal Murray sinking the free throw to tie the game and force overtime -- after Nikola Jokić rimmed out a game-winning 3-point attempt. In overtime, the Nuggets darted out to a quick lead and never relinquished it, with some more calls and no-calls down the stretch that frustrated the Rockets. After the way the game ended, Udoka wasn't in much of a mood to hold back on officiating he felt wasn't up to the level of the basketball being played. You don't often hear a coach say two refs flat out shouldn't be out there, and doing that while also calling Zarba \"star struck\" in the way he called the game for Jokić will certainly not sit well with the league. \nA fine is almost assuredly coming for Udoka, but he wanted to deliver a message to his team that they don't need to change the way they play because of how that game was officiated, telling the Rockets, \"Keep being who we are, we're not going to adjust to poor officials.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Saturday felt like a significant moment in NBA Cup history. San Antonio's upset over Oklahoma City didn't just punch a ticket to the tournament final. It was a message to the rest of the sport. The Spurs are no longer just a young team on the rise. They're here, now, ready to compete with any team in the league. And after taking down the Western Conference favorite on Saturday, they'll get their shot at the Eastern Conference favorite on Tuesday against the KnicksThe Knicks took the quieter path to the final. They didn't have to slay Luka Dončić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to get here. But New York has waited 52 years for a pro basketball championship of any kind. This isn't the one they've spent five decades waiting for, but you can bet the Knicks still want to bring this trophy back home to New York as NBA Cup champions, and they, too, want to make a statement. If you can't beat the champ, beating the team that beat the champ is the next best thing.So let's dig in on Tuesday's NBA Cup final and make some best bets for the marquee game of the regular season thus far.New York Knicks vs. San Antonio SpursTime: 8:30 p.m. ET | Date: Tuesday, Dec. 16Location: T-Mobile Arena -- Las VegasLive stream: Amazon Prime VideoOdds (via FanDuel): NYK -136 | SA +116 | O/U: 232.5\nThere isn't much separating the Knicks and Spurs at this point. They have the same record (18-7). New York's net rating is meaningfully higher, but that makes sense when you consider Victor Wembanyama's lengthy absence. The Spurs with Wembanyama are roughly even with the Knicks when Jalen Brunson plays. They haven't played this season, so there's no template here. We're just betting on styles here. San Antonio allows the second-most mid-range shots in the NBA, and the sixth-highest mid-range field goal percentage. That sort of aggressive drop-coverage can be very problematic against Jalen Brunson, specifically. He loves walking into mid-range jumpers as bigs hang near the basket, and in a big game, he's going to be willing to take and make as many of those shots as it takes. In a game this even, that little matchup advantage gives New York the slimmest of edges. The Pick: Knicks -2.5It's a simple pick, but I almost always lean toward the under in single-elimination games. Game 7s almost always see low scores, so the bet here is that the players start out tight and miss some early shots. Remember, most of these Spurs are young and reasonably inexperienced in big-game settings. The Knicks aren't, but this is also one of the NBA's slowest teams, and should therefore be eager to turn this into a half-court slugfest rather than a track meet with the younger, faster Spurs. The Pick: Under 232.5\nWe covered the sort of shots San Antonio gives up. What about the Knicks? They're near the top of the league in 3-pointers allowed, specifically out of the left corner. Why does this matter? Because Harrison Barnes takes the second-most left corner 3s per game in the entire NBA, and he's made over 47% of them this season. You're paying a big vig here, but I think it's worth it. The Pick: Barnes Over 1.5 3-pointers (-190)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and, with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us, we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free-agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. The Imai marketRight-hander Tatsuya Imai profiles as one of the top starting pitchers on the market this offseason and, with a Jan. 2 signing deadline as part of the posting rules, he's expected to pick his MLB employer soon. Imai has already signaled that he's not inclined to sign with the Dodgers, and instead the Wall Street Journal reports that the Yankees, Cubs, and Phillies are the teams that seem to have the strongest designs on Imai's services. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Imai as the No. 12 free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: Relative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB, pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings. He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3 starter as soon as next spring.King could decide soon\nMichael King's two-season stint in San Diego established him as a frontline starting pitcher, at least when health permits, and that's made him a coveted presence on the free-agent market. Speaking of which, Mark Feinsand of MLB.com reports that King may be the next starting pitcher to make his decision and that the Yankees, Red Sox, Cubs, Orioles, and Mets are at present the strongest contenders for his services. \nKing, 30, transitioned from reliever to starter after the Padres acquired him from the Yankees. Over 45 starts and one relief appearance for San Diego, he put up an ERA+ of 134 and an FIP of 3.65. Mets eyeing more tradesOut are Pete Alonso, Edwin Díaz, and Brandon Nimmo, and in are Jorge Polanco, Devin Williams, and Marcus Semien. The Mets under David Stearns this winter may not be done churning the roster. Specifically, the rotation could be poised for significant turnover, and said turnover might be achieved via trades. Speaking of which, David Peterson and Kodai Senga are available in trade, Jorge Castillo of ESPN reports, on a contract-for-contract basis with the goal of adding frontline talent to the rotation to accompany promising youngster Nolan McLean. However the specifics shake out, upgrading the rotation in Queens is probably the most essential order of business before the offseason is up. \nWeaver return on Yanks' radar\nOver the last two seasons and change, right-hander Luke Weaver, 32, has emerged as a lockdown presence in the Yankees bullpen. Weaver's now a free agent, and the Athletic reports that there's mutual interest in a reunion. The Yankees have already lost Devin Williams to the Mets this winter, so re-upping with Weaver could be a bullpen priority for GM Brian Cashman. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jeremy Doku is set to miss the remainder of Manchester City's games in 2025 with Pep Guardiola pencilling in the visit to Sunderland on New Year's Day as a comeback date for the winger.Doku, who has been in outstanding form this season, missed the trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday with a leg injury and is expected to miss between two and three weeks of action. \"I think he will maybe be in Sunderland, maybe,\" said Guardiola in his press conference ahead of City's EFL Cup quarterfinal against Brentford on Wednesday. That is a match for which John Stones and Rodri will also be unavailable while Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri have departed for the Africa Cup of Nations.Doku's absence will be a keenly felt one, even if only for a relatively short period and a manageable set of fixtures. City's next two Premier League games are at home to West Ham and away to a resurgent Nottingham Forest, the latter a team where the creativity and ball-carrying of the winger would be particularly valuable. Any further setback would be even more of a headache for City, who will travel to the Stadium of Light on January 1 before welcoming Chelsea to the Etihad Stadium three days later.Per 90 Premier League minutes this season, nobody creates more chances than Doku's 3.44. In total output he is only bettered by Bruno Fernandes. It is a similar story for expected assists as the 23-year-old blossoms into one of the English game's most devastating wide options. Based on the table below, that might even be a mild assessment of his performance. So far this season there has been no one more effective at carrying the ball up the field and then creating for others.\n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Crucially for City, as well, Doku is the most consistent player at doing the thing that Guardiola has geared his team around this season: getting shots for Erling Haaland. Nine of the striker's 59 shots in the Premier League this season have been assisted by the Belgian, the most of any player in the squad. Doku put it best himself last month. \"Haaland eats goals and I'm his chef.\"It is worth noting that Haaland didn't starve on Sunday as City found a way to three goals without their most consistent progressor and creator this season. Rayan Cherki continued his impressive upwards trajectory of recent weeks and while Phil Foden did not impress his manager he weighed in with a crucial goal to break Palace's resistance. Those two should be able to cope with the first half of a burdensome festive fixture list, but it is after them that the worries emerge. Savinho has been a shadow of the player he threatened to be early in his City career while Oscar Bobb is a 22-year-old with just 776 career minutes. Without Doku and Marmoush, Guardiola looks light on attacking options.Both Savinho and Bobb could come in to start Wednesday's EFL Cup quarterfinal as Guardiola bids to win his fifth EFL Cup, five years after the last in a run of four straight triumphs. \"The players who didn't play recently are going to play, academy as well,\" said the City boss, whose last bout of heavy rotation resulted in a bruising defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League. \"I'm not saying it's not the priority to get to the semifinals of the EFL Cup. Normally when we achieve it it's because we have all the squad, no injuries, we can rotate, the team is good.\n\"Maybe in the Leverkusen game we missed a father figure on the pitch. There are players where it's not about the quality, it's about how he leads. Young players who still don't have courage for the process, they don't have to say it doesn't matter what happens. \"When they don't have [an experienced leader], it's like 'oh I have to do it'... I have to find the balance. It's a lesson. I have to learn that.\"James Trafford will be among the younger players who come into the XI, the former Burnley goalkeeper having found himself sidelined since Gianluigi Donnarumma arrived just over a month after his signing in the summer. Despite links to Tottenham, West Ham and one-time suitors Newcastle, Guardiola said he expects the 23-year-old to stay for the remainder of the season.\n\"He's an incredible keeper,\" Guardiola said of Trafford. \"Unfortunately Gigio is the first keeper but he's incredible... He's been with us this season and after we'll see what happens. Does he stay in January? Absolutely.\"Manchester City vs. Brentford viewing informationDate: Wednesday, Dec. 17 | Time: 2:30 p.m. ETLocation: Etihad Stadium -- Manchester, United KingdomLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Manchester City -275; Draw +380; Brentford +650\n            ",

He only played 21 minutes but had 22 points and some crucial defensive plays down the stretch. San Antonio has seen good progress from last year's Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle, who is averaging 18.4 points per game this season. Castle had 30 points and 10 rebounds in San Antonio's win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the quarterfinal round and followed it up with 22 points and six boards in the win over Oklahoma City. Wembanyama did not have any setbacks, so he's expected to be good to go for Tuesday's semifinal. The Spurs are 13-10-2 ATS on the season and 14-11 to the Over. They have a 118.0 offensive rating and 113.8 defensive rating. San Antonio has a relatively deep rotation, with nine guys averaging 20 minutes or more per game.New York runs things a bit differently, with six players averaging 27+ minutes per game. The Knicks are at full strength with the return of OG Anunoby, who is averaging 17.3 points per game since he got back on the floor. Brunson, Anunoby, Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges anchor the starting lineup, with Josh Hart likely to fill the final spot. The Knicks are only behind the Denver Nuggets in offensive rating at 122.0 while carrying a defensive rating of 113.3. They are 17-8 ATS on the season and 13-12 to the Over.Neither team has won the NBA Cup in its three-year history. The Spurs have not appeared in the knockout stage prior to this season's NBA Cup, while the Knicks lost their first knockout game in each of the last two editions. The winning team gets $530,000 per player while the losing team gets $212,373 per player.Spurs vs. Knicks odds, picks, predictionsThe Knicks are 2.5-point favorites in the latest Spurs vs. Knicks SportsLine consensus odds and the total sits at 227.5.

    "body": "\n        Through 15 weeks, there have only been two playoff spots clinched around that NFL, but that number could be going way up this weekend and that's because there are nine different teams that could clinch a playoff spot in Week 16. The Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams both punched their ticket to the playoffs on Sunday and as of right now, those are the only two teams who have clinched a spot. The Broncos actually have a path to clinch the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC this week, but there's only one scenario where that could happen in Week 16: DEN win + LAC loss or tie + NE loss + BUF loss or tieThe Broncos are playing the Jaguars while the Chargers will be facing the Cowboys in Dallas. As for the Patriots, they'll be traveling to Baltimore for a Sunday night game and the Bills will be facing the Browns in Cleveland. Even if those four things don't go Denver's way, the Broncos can still clinch the AFC West title in Week 16 if one of the two following scenarios happens: DEN win + LAC loss or tie ORDEN tie + LAC lossIf the Broncos clinch the AFC West, it would mark their first division title since 2015, which was a big year for the organization, because that's the last time it won the Super Bowl. \nNow, let's take a look at the nine teams that could clinch a spot in Week 16. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills (10-4)The Bills have been to the playoffs for six straight years and they can make it seven if one of the following scenarios happens this weekend: BUF win + IND loss or tie ORBUF win + HOU loss or tie ORBUF tie + IND loss ORBUF tie + HOU lossEither the Colts or Texans will have a say in whether the Bills get in this week. The Texans are hosting the Raiders on Sunday while the Colts will be playing on Monday against the 49ers. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England Patriots (11-3)The Patriots can't clinch the AFC East this week, but they can clinch a playoff berth and for that to happen, all they have to do is beat the Ravens on Sunday night. \nNE win or tie ORIND loss or tie ORHOU loss or tieIf the Patriots lose to the Ravens and the Texans beat the Raiders, New England will still be able to clinch a spot if the 49ers beat the Colts on Monday night. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)The Jaguars are traveling to Denver this week and there's a chance that they could clinch a playoff spot for the second time over the past seven years. Let's take a look at their playoff scenarios: JAX win + IND loss or tie ORJAX win + HOU loss or tie ORJAX tie + IND loss ORJAX tie + IND tie + HOU lossSince a tie probably isn't going to happen, the Jags' best bet is a win over the Broncos combined with a Colts loss to the 49ers. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Chargers (10-4) The Chargers are another team that can get in with a win combined with a Colts loss to San Francisco. Let's check out all of the Chargers playoff-clinching scenarios for Week 16. LAC win + IND loss or tie ORLAC win + HOU loss or tie ORLAC tie + IND loss ORLAC tie + IND tie + HOU lossTo even have a shot to clinch a spot, the Chargers will have to beat the Cowboys on the road this week. Now let's move on to the NFC, where there are five teams that could clinch. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)It's been 21 years since a team won the NFC East in back-to-back seasons, but that drought can end this week if the Eagles beat the Commanders on Saturday. The Eagles can clinch the NFC East title along with a playoff spot if any of these three scenarios happens: \nPHI win ORDAL loss ORPHI tie + DAL tieIf the Eagles win on Saturday, that would eliminate the Cowboys from playoff contention. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago Bears (10-4)If the Bears can beat the Packers on Saturday, they'll have a shot to clinch a spot this weekend, but they'll need some help from a bitter enemy: Aaron Rodgers.  CHI win + DET loss or tie ORCHI tie + DET lossIf the Bears to do pull off the win against Green Bay, that means they'll be rooting for Rodgers on Sunday since his Steelers will be facing the Lions. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)If the Packers beat the Bears on Saturday, then they'll be cheering for Rodgers to beat the Lions since a Pittsburgh win would send Green Bay to the playoffs. GB win + DET loss or tie ORGB tie + DET lossThe only way the Bears and Packers can BOTH clinch a spot this week is if they tie and the Lions lose. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ers (10-4)The 49ers have quietly put together a strong season and they can clinch a playoff spot by winning on Monday against the Colts. \nSF win ORDET loss ORSF tie + DET tieOf course, the 49ers could clinch before Monday night if the Lions lose to the Steelers. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Seahawks (11-3)The Seahawks have a showdown with the Rams on Thursday night and if they win, they'll be headed to the playoffs for just the second time over the past five seasons. Here are the two scenarios that would get Seattle into the postseason this week. SEA win or tie ORDET loss or tieThere's a good chance that the NFC West could send three teams to the playoffs this year. If the Lions lose to the Steelers on Sunday, the 49ers and Seahawks will both be in. \nLet's take a look at who's in and who's out so far: 1. *Rams (11-3) -- NFC West leader2. Bears (10-4) -- NFC North leader3. Eagles (9-5) -- NFC East leader 4. Buccaneers (7-7) -- NFC South leader5. Seahawks (11-3)6. 49ers (10-4)7. Packers (9-4-1)NFC playoff spots clinched: RamsNFC teams eliminated: Vikings, Falcons, Saints, Commanders, Cardinals, GiantsNow, let's check out the AFC: 1. *Broncos (12-2) -- AFC West leader2. Patriots (11-3) -- AFC East leader 3. Jaguars (10-4) -- AFC South leader4. Steelers (7-6) -- AFC North leader5. Chargers (10-4)6. Bills (10-4) 7. Texans (9-5)AFC playoff spots clinched: BroncosAFC teams eliminated: Chiefs, Dolphins, Bengals, Jets, Browns, Raiders, TitansThe only team that can be eliminated from playoff contention this week is the Cowboys. If the Eagles win on Saturday, then Dallas is out. If the Eagles lose, then the Cowboys would also be knocked out with a loss to the Chargers on Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a staring contest going on in Milwaukee right now. A good one, at that. Neither side has blinked for months. Every now and then, Giannis Antetokounmpo nudges the Bucks toward a trade, and every time, without fail, the Bucks pretend they didn't hear him. Nobody's even willing to take responsibility for the rumors. Antetokounmpo isn't comfortable with all of this, according to Chris Haynes. That's all his representatives. If that sounds a bit like a bewildered Mr. Burns asking how he can be held responsible for what his goons are ordered to do, well, congratulations. You've passed rumor mill literacy 101.The Bucks won't trade Antetokounmpo until he forces them to do so, and considering his reported aversion to doing so, they seemingly have a window, however small and however brief, to potentially change his mind. Both Eric Nehm and Marc Stein are reporting that they are attempting to do so by sniffing around win-now trades.This is par for the Bucks course. Every time the trade buzz starts, Milwaukee has managed to avert it with a home run swing. A year before his 2021 free agency, the Bucks landed Jrue Holiday and convinced him to extend. The same story played out with Damian Lillard in 2023. When noise got louder following Lillard's torn Achilles last spring, they waived and stretched him in order to sign Myles Turner. Giannis legally couldn't extend at that point, but reportedly approved of the move. Seemingly not enough to avoid a wandering eye, but enough to put off a formal request at least for the moment.That's where Milwaukee sits today. History tells this front office that if they can just keep kicking the can down the road long enough, just keep avoiding that direct, irrefutable trade request, they can take another home run swing and hope it connects. With the easiest stretch on their schedule coming up, maybe the Bucks (currently 11-16 and 10th in the East) can even win enough games in the short term to eke their way back into Eastern Conference contention by the time Antetokounmpo recovers from his calf strain. That's the goal here. Survive long enough to get Antetokounmpo back, then upgrade before the deadline so he'll have a reason to stay.\nThere are two pretty significant problems with that concept. The first traces back to the Lillard-for-Turner swap. Last year's Bucks had an extremely top-heavy salary structure featuring two supermax players at the top and very little depth on the bottom. Axing Lillard for Turner replaced an enormous salary for a smaller one, but didn't offer the benefits doing so would under most circumstances because it involved taking on a $20 million dead cap charge for Lillard. All of this leaves the Bucks with very little tradable salary. \n        \n            \n                Ultimate NBA trade guide: 100 candidates who could move as basketball trade season unofficially begins\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAside from Antetokounmpo and Turner, the Bucks have only two players making even mid-level money: Kyle Kuzma and Bobby Portis, neither of whom are trivial to the existing rotation. After that, they have only two players making even $4 million: Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins, both of whom are bargains at their current price points. After that? Minimums all the way down.And then there's the matter of draft capital. Milwaukee's first-round picks between now and 2030 are owed out through prior trades. That means they have one to trade, in either 2031 or 2032. That obviously isn't much under the best of circumstances, which these aren't. It would be absolute organizational malpractice for an 11-16 team to give up a first-round pick six years away in the name of short-term improvement even if they weren't staring down the reality of losing their best player and marching through half of a decade without their picks. Unless Antetokounmpo explicitly says he'll extend, trading anymore picks is a nonstarter.\nSo that's where the Bucks sit today. They want to improve, but shouldn't use their meager pick supply to do so and may not even have the money to make a big addition feasible. Where does that leave them? Probably shopping around for bad contracts.Zach LaVine, with a cap hit of $47.5 million, could be a Bucks trade target. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The most common name they've been linked to has been Zach LaVine. Sacramento would love to get out of the last year of his contract and would probably give him up purely for matching salary. Great. Several problems, though. First, Kuzma and Portis are important. Swapping them out for LaVine may improve the guard offense, but it would cost the Bucks their only athletic wing and their best bench scorer. Would that even be worth it? Would LaVine even represent that much of an upgrade over Rollins and Porter? Probably not, but desperate times may call for desperate measures.That's a post-trade problem. Here's a pre-trade problem: Portis and Kuzma alone aren't enough to legally match salary on LaVine's $47.4 million cap figure. The Bucks would need to include another $2.4 million. So long, Gary Harris. That's no major loss, but it would leave Sacramento with 17 rostered players. Would the Kings want this deal badly enough to waive two players? Is there another deal the Kings could attach that would allow them to balance their roster? In all likelihood, someone is going to need to grease the wheels for a third team to take on Harris and a King. That means a second-round pick or more most of the time. The Bucks literally don't have one. Between now and 2032, Milwaukee has just a single second-rounder. It's a top-55 protected pick from Utah this year. So it's fake. The Bucks can't even bribe someone into taking a minimum contract off of their hands.\nYou can apply these concerns to most players in the max range. Milwaukee might theoretically be the sort of team that could justify taking on Paul George, for instance, given their enormous wing need. He makes even more than LaVine. So does Kawhi Leonard, probably the best single player they have the assets to hypothetically chase. Any of the higher-end All-Stars on the market are just too costly. Say the Bucks were willing to talk picks in an Anthony Davis trade. They'd have to include Turner just to match the money. Where is a Davis-Antetokounmpo duo getting you with little else?There are cheaper cap dumps out there. None really make sense for the Bucks. DeMar DeRozan is likely just as gettable as LaVine from Sacramento. Milwaukee's entire roster theory relies on having 3-point shooters around Antetokounmpo. That's not DeRozan. The biggest area of need right now is perimeter defense. There just isn't much of it available, and what little actually might be feasible comes with all sorts of other drawbacks. Would the Bucks really want to spend all of their remaining draft capital on the Pelicans' Herb Jones knowing that he's an inconsistent shooter? Probably not.If there's an answer here, it's going to be the uncomfortable one. Milwaukee's clearest path to a significant upgrade probably comes over the summer. Several pretty significant changes come at that point.\nMoving money gets easier for everyone. AJ Green's extension gives the Bucks another eight-figure salary to work with, but they can also sign-and-trade their own free agents if they need to create a bit more money to work with, and with bigger offseason roster limits of 20 players, it's easier for teams to absorb contracts and figure the rest out later.Milwaukee will also have more draft capital to work with. As it stands right now, the Bucks don't technically control their 2026 first-round pick, and they can't trade it in-season, but functionally, they're going to have it when the draft arrives in June. Why? Because it is currently tied to swap rights with the Pelicans, who are far worse than they are at 5-22. Either the Bucks keep their own pick, or it miraculously jumps up in the lottery, in which case, they get the New Orleans pick as a solid consolation prize. Either way, if the Bucks don't improve, they should have a decent 2026 pick to trade with. Their 2033 pick also unlocks as a trade chip, as the league calendar will roll over and bring it within the seven-year trade window.And then of course, new players become available with every passing transaction cycle. Nobody available today seems capable of turning the Bucks around, or more importantly, convincing Antetokounmpo that this team is even capable of turning around. That might be different in June or July. \nOf course, that's means getting to June or July. That's been Jon Horst's superpower as Milwaukee's GM. He buys time until a rabbit hops into his hat. But Antetokounmpo could end this at any moment. All he has to do is ask for the trade, stop dancing around the obvious and accept that getting to a real contender means being the bad guy in Milwaukee. The moment he blinks, the Bucks lose the staring contest.The Bucks could force the issue. Even if Giannis asks, they don't have to trade him during the season, or during the offseason for that matter. They could tell him \"there will be no trade, you will be a Buck until and unless you exercise your right to become a free agent in 2027,\" and then try to rebuild the team without his blessing. Good luck getting buy-in from your existing players in that world, much less any new ones you might want to recruit.This all sounds pretty pessimistic. It should. It's pretty rare for 31-year-old stars to want to stay with 11-16 teams that don't control their picks or have young talent on the horizon. This isn't an overnight mistake. It took years for the Bucks to dig this hole, and it will take years for them to pull their way out of it even if they trade Antetokounmpo tomorrow. That's unavoidable. The only question now is whether they're ready to start climbing or if they're really going to insist on digging further with another shortsighted move.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With just three weeks remaining in the 2025 NFL regular season, most eyes in and around the league are on the playoff race, which is still incredibly closely contended in each conference. But it's also not the only race drawing attention: the contest for the Most Valuable Player award is, for good reason, heating up. Right now, there are three inner-circle candidates: Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford (-300 at DraftKings), New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye (+425) and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (+550). Everybody else in the league is at +7500 odds or worse, giving them a less than 2% chance to win the award. With that in mind, we want to take a look at what likely needs to happen down the stretch of the season for each of those players to come award with the trophy at the end of the year, as well as if there's anything that any of the other pseudo-contenders can do to crash the party.Below, we will break down the latest NFL MVP odds, courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Matthew Stafford, Rams (-300)\nStafford is the heavy favorite heading into the final three weeks of the season, with the odds implying that he has a 75% chance to win the award, which is pretty incredible. It's also perhaps not that surprising. Stafford leads the NFL in touchdown passes, passer rating and adjusted net yards per attempt, while ranking fifth in TruMedia's EPA per dropback. The Rams are also the No. 1 seed in the NFC in large part due to his exploits. For him to keep this stranglehold on the award, the Rams probably need to hang onto the top seed in the conference down the stretch of the season. To that end, Thursday's game against the division rival Seattle Seahawks is absolutely massive. If the Rams win, they'll be a full game ahead of the Seahawks with the tiebreaker in hand, and a game and a half ahead of the San Francisco 49ers and the Chicago Bears. They'd have the inside track on the NFC West title and the No. 1 spot. The MVP usually comes from a team that wins one of the top two or three slots in its conference, and given that the other inner-circle candidates seem like they could be fighting for second place in the AFC at best, it would go a long way toward securing things for Stafford is he can help his team wrap up the No. 1 seed. \nEspecially if he puts together a strong performance against a Seahawks defense that is one of the best in the NFL -- and does so on \"Thursday Night Football\" -- he'll have the opportunity to create a really powerful narrative heading into the stretch run.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Drake Maye, Patriots (+425)\nIt's very interesting that Maye still has better odds than Allen after the way Sunday's game went. Maye's team is a game ahead of Allen's in the AFC East race, and it seems like that's probably why Maye remains \"ahead\" in the race in the eyes of the oddsmakers.New England's three remaining games are against the Baltimore Ravens, the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins. That Ravens game is on \"Sunday Night Football\" next week, so Maye will have a chance to make a huge statement in that game. \nIf the Patriots pull off a win powered by a big performance from Maye, then beat the Jets and Dolphins in the final two weeks of the season, then maybe he can pull off a comeback and overtake Stafford for the award -- especially if Stafford struggles and/or the Rams lose to the Seahawks in another national game on Thursday. Stafford has the numbers on Maye, which is why he's such a heavy implied favorite at the moment, but there are a lot of narrative voters out there, and big games late in the season can often have an outsized effect on the outcome. New England could also still possibly pull off nabbing the No. 1 seed in the AFC by surpassing the Denver Broncos down the stretch of the season. The Pats are a game behind Denver, which plays the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers over the next three weeks. Maye and New England will need to go 3-0 and have Denver go 1-2 or worse down the stretch in order to flip the seeding, though, and if the Patriots come in second in their conference while the Rams come in first, that may be a deciding factors in the minds of some voters. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Josh Allen, Bills (+550)\nGiven the current odds, it seems like Vegas thinks the Bills need to win the AFC East in order for Allen to win the MVP. The likelihood of the MVP coming from a team that finishes with the No. 5 or 6 seed in its own conference seems extremely low -- even if that team finishes with the third-best record in the conference and is only that low in the seeding because of tiebreakers. \nThe Bills are still alive in the division race, but their chances aren't great. They probably need to win out and have the Patriots lose at least once, and the only way they pass the Pats if the two teams finish with the same record is if one or more of New England's losses comes against one of the two AFC East teams left on the schedule. If the Pats lose to the Ravens but beat the Jets and Dolphins, they still win the division.Still, if Allen goes scorched earth down the stretch of the season, tearing apart the Cleveland Browns, Philadelphia Eagles and Jets, maybe there's a chance that voters overlook the standings and decide that Allen is the best player in the NFL and therefore deserves to take home the trophy. \n        \n            \n                Who can stop the Rams? Updated Super Bowl 2026 odds as the NFL playoff race starts to heat up\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe othersBroncos quarterback Bo Nix and Packers quarterback Jordan Love are next up in the odds at DraftKings, each at +7500, making them significant long shots. Beyond them, it's Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and Bears quarterback Caleb Williams each at +10000 odds.\nIt's hard to see any of them overtaking any of the quarterbacks above. If Nix were a serious candidate, he would already be getting more love in the odds markets. Most people in and around the league give Denver's defense the lion's share of the credit for the Broncos having the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and rightfully so. Nix is coming off his best game of the season -- and arguably the best of his career -- and if that didn't shift the odds in his favor, it's hard to see anything that could happen down the stretch that would do so. The Broncos keeping the top spot in the AFC, though, could hold back Maye and/or Allen's candidacy for the award.With the Packers falling behind the Bears in the NFC North, it's going to be hard for Love to jump into the mix. That's especially the case because it's going to be difficult for Green Bay to close out the season with victories after the injuries to Micah Parsons and Christian Watson, the latter of which thankfully isn't considered serious but which could still affect the team if he has to miss time.Darnold isn't playing particularly well in recent weeks as the Seahawks offense has sputtered several times. He has an opportunity to change the narrative against the Rams on Thursday, though, and if he hits a heater down the stretch and the Seahawks capture the top seed, he could garner down-ballot votes and/or damage Stafford's candidacy. \nHerbert hasn't been great the last two weeks while playing with a broken hand, and the best the Chargers can do is likely the No. 5 seed given how far they are behind the Broncos in the division race. And Williams, like Nix, doesn't get the lion's share of the credit for his team's success, given the strength of the run game and how the passing game has been inconsistent throughout much of the season.\n            ",

Brent Brookhouse here to walk you through all the news you need to know in the world of sports as the NFL season continues to wind down.There's never not a good time to be a sports fan, and those of us with a little curiosity can find ways to fill even the slower hours of the day. For example, I found myself watching the World Darts Championship on Monday morning and afternoon. I didn't know what was going on, but it was chaotic fun -- and a man punched a table. I'm all in now and will continue watching on Tuesday. (Check the TV listings section for the time.) With that in mind, let's get into it with all the news you need, and the sports you can watch, on this December Tuesday. \n 🩼 Five things to know Tuesday Micah Parsons suffers torn ACL. The worst-case scenario for Parsons was confirmed, as the Packers' star pass rusher is now out for the remainder of the season with a torn ACL. Parsons' injury has opened up the NFC, with Green Bay's most impactful defensive player out just weeks before the start of the playoffs.Big Ten dominates All-America team. The 2025 AP All-America team was released on Monday, and the Big Ten was the big winner. The league had 10 selections, beating out the SEC's six.Fernando Mendoza is the odds-on favorite to be No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft. Mendoza was already the betting favorite to be selected No. 1 overall in next spring's NFL Draft, but the Indiana quarterback received a bump after winning the Heisman Trophy, moving to -165. In our latest mock draft, the Jets are trading up to select Mendoza first overall. Meanwhile, Heisman runner-up Diego Pavia had to apologize for a disrespectful social media post about the award voters.Round one of the CFP looms. With the first round of the CFP just days away, we took time to rank the first-round games by upset potential.

Florida's DJ Lagway led the way, announcing his plans to leave the Gators after two seasons. A former No. 3 recruit, Lagway figures to be one of the most desired players in the upcoming portal window. A report by CBS Sports' Chris Hummer said that Lagway wanted to remain a Gator, even after the university fired coach Billy Napier, but when meeting new coach Jon Sumrall \"questioned who Lagway is as a football player,\" it didn't provide the kind of reassurance Lagway was looking for moving forward. Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby is also set to transfer, as is Nebraska QB Dylan Raiola, with the trio of planned moves providing a major shake-up to the college football landscape. For more on the Lagway situation, check out his top potential landing spots.  🏀 Which NBA superstars could be traded? \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Nearly 17% of the NBA became trade-eligible on Dec. 15, the point at which most free agents from the previous offseason can be legally traded. The NBA trade deadline falls on Feb. 5, leaving a wide stretch of time in which major moves can be made. We all remember the shock of last season's Feb. 2 trade that sent Luka Dončić to the Lakers with Anthony Davis as the primary player sent back to the Mavericks. \nDavis is now one of the biggest names that could be dealt during this season's trade period. But, in Sam Quinn's look at 100 players who could be on the move, Davis only ranks second, with Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting No. 1. Quinn: \"The biggest domino of the trade deadline. Maybe the biggest domino of any trade deadline. Players this good are practically never traded in their primes, and when they are, and it isn't out of nowhere in the middle of the night like it was for Luka Dončić, it almost always comes in the offseason. Making a blockbuster is harder in the middle of the season. There are roster limits. Teams have less financial wiggle room. But the moment Antetokounmpo says the word, suitors will line up out the door. For now, the Bucks are continuing to pretend everything is fine. It seems like a matter of 'when,' not 'if' here.\" 🏈 Steelers hold on to AFC North lead with win over Dolphins \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers are still in command of the AFC North after a 28-15 win over the Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football.\" With the win, the Steelers improved to 8-6 on the season and picked up a much-needed win to continue to keep the Ravens in the rear-view mirror. Pittsburgh took a 7-3 lead into the locker room at the half, but blew the game open in the third quarter with a 14-0 run on the back of a pair of Rodgers touchdown passes. More stark was the Steelers' advantage in yards in the third quarter, totaling 163 yards to minus-20 for Miami. \nThe performance was good enough to earn the Steelers an A- in our Week 15 NFL grades, while the Dolphins received a D as their already desperate playoff hopes were officially dashed.  👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            With Patrick Mahomes sidelined for the rest of the season, and possibly well into next season, Tom Brady gave insight into what the recovery process is like for quarterbacks.Bills superstar quarterback Josh Allen was caught on camera vomiting during the team's fierce second-half comeback win over the Patriots.

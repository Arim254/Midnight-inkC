    "body": "\n        When middleweight contender Anthony \"Fluffy\" Hernandez attempts to compare the version of himself who lost via stoppage in two of his first three UFC bouts beginning in 2019 to his current standing as the author of an eight-fight win streak, he says the difference is quite simple. \"Sometimes I believe in myself too f---ing much and that's the issue,\" Hernandez told CBS Sports on Tuesday. \"No excuses at all. The guys who beat me [Markus Perez and Kevin Holland] were better on those nights. What it came down to is I just took a long look in the mirror and realized that I can't just fight for money. I have to go out there [only] when I'm healthy. Everyone in this f---ing UFC is really f---ing good. This is the cream of the crop.\"Hernandez (15-2, 1 NC) believes that once he made the adjustment of not \"playing with my money,\" he began to show a true championship form. The momentum has taken him into Saturday's UFC Fight Night main event in Houston where the No. 4-ranked Hernandez will face former champion Sean Strickland (29-7) in a five-round fight that could determine the next title challenger at 185 pounds. Sign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nSo, how did the 32-year-old native of Dunnigan, California, secure a fight as important as this? By practicing what he preaches. Last October, Hernandez made the difficult decision to withdraw from a crucial headlining bout in Vancouver against an Reinier de Ridder when he suffered an undisclosed injury. De Ridder went on to lose against replacement Brendan Allen to halt his momentum, lifting a now healthy Hernandez into an even bigger fight inside the Toyota Center against Strickland, whom \"Fluffy\" has called the perfect style matchup for him. \n\"You have seen how [Strickland] goes against wrestlers, it doesn't usually end well,\" Hernandez said. \"That doesn't mean that I necessarily want to wrestle but I feel like this fight is perfect for me. I think if you beat a former champ, that really makes a statement because everybody is really good here. Someone who has already done that shit, you go out there and take him out? You are sitting in a really good place.\"\nStrickland, a native of Anaheim, California, who now fights out of Las Vegas, took umbrage with Hernandez's comments when speaking to CBS Sports on Tuesday and believes the gap in elite experience between the two will prove to be Hernandez's undoing. That doesn't mean that Strickland doesn't have a lot to prove, however. The former champion enters Saturday on a one-year layoff and has lost two of his last three fights, although both defeats came in title bouts against former champion Dricus du Plessis. But even though Strickland's 2024 loss to DDP was via split decision in a highly disputed result, their rematch last February saw Strickland struggle to make adjustments or fight with passion as critics called him boring. \"[Hernandez] has never fought a grappler like me or even a striker. He has been steamrolling guys that I could f---ing write a clinic on,\" Strickland said. \"So, no, he's not [on my level]. You have never fought a grappler like me. I have trained with the guys you trained with and trained with the guys that you beat. No, I'll write a book on it, you'll see. After we get done, they are going to start calling me a grappler.\"\nEven though Strickland is known for his formidable takedown defense, offensive wrestling isn't a consistently strong aspect of his game, which makes his grappling comments somewhat amusing (and is likely Strickland just trolling). The reality is that Strickland enters as the betting underdog not just because of Hernandez's momentum but due to the fact that he's a well-rounded threat with incredible cardio and an iron chin.The real intrigue in this fight is to find out whether Hernandez can have the same success against elite foes that he has had in dominating the back end of the 185-pound rankings, where he has finished six of his eight opponents during his current win streak. None were more impressive or demoralizing than the beating he put upon the typically durable Roman Dolidze last August when Hernandez made a point to gas the slugging Georgian out before dragging him to the center of the Octagon, choking him out and dropping his lifeless body.   \"It's like I have been telling the UFC, quit f---ing playing with me. Give me somebody that's like a real test,\" Hernandez said. \"[Dolidze] thought he was going to big brother me and walk through me. Yeah, he has beaten some people but that's not the f---ing case. If I'm healthy, I'll beat the f--- out of you, I promise. I don't care who the f--- you are. That energy is just what I brought. If you are trying to big dog me, I'm going to f---ing big dog you.\"\nAlthough Strickland offensive game is typically built upon crowding his opponents with constant pressure and utilizing defense and head movement to be able to land strikes at close range without getting hit, he's facing a fighter in Hernandez who can weaponize cardio in a manner that very few UFC fighters (namely former bantamweight king Merab Dvalishvili) are able to do. Hernandez said it normally takes him one to two rounds to fatigue and drown his opponents but expects the Strickland fight to be a much greater challenge that could take close to the five-round limit before he can \"end up torturing him and drowning him.\" It's because of Hernandez's combination of skills, which include him holding UFC middleweight records for most career takedowns and highest significant striking percentage, that many are starting to believe he might be the perfect Kryptonite to the dominant wrestling game of unbeaten champion Khamzat Chimaev (15-0), who shut DDP out over five rounds last August to commandeer the title.\n\"[Chimaev] is just going to hug you and hold you down,\" Hernandez said. \"He doesn't want to f---ing bang on his feet and he's not exciting. That's kind of what I took away from that shit. But I believe that I am championship material. I believe I'll beat Khamzat and I believe that I'll clear out the division. That's just what I truly believe. Until I'm proven wrong, I'm going to keep believing that shit.\"  Although UFC has yet to name the first title challenger of Chimaev's reign, No. 2-ranked Nassourdine Imavov and his five-fight win streak has him in the mix along with the winner of Saturday's headlining bout. But the brash Strickland believes an immediate title shot is unlikely for anyone given the fact that the 31-year-old Chimaev has fought just once in each of the last three years.\n\"An immediate title shot? Do you know who is champion?\" Strickland said. \"We have a Chechnyan f---ing whore as a champion. The title is on ice, dog. You think that guy is going to fight? And let's say they give it to Nassourdine, every time this f---ing dude [Chimaev] fights, he sprains his pinky. The motherf---er is chronically hurt without any evidence. He apparently breaks his f---ing hand every fight and I've never seen an X-ray. The middleweight division will be on ice for a year and a half or two years until he is forced to fight.\"\nRegardless of what happens next, all eyes remain glued on a must-see middleweight tilt in Houston where Strickland believes that a finish of Hernandez is unlikely because \"he has a f---ing brick for a head so it's hard to put him away,\" but that his advantages in striking and grappling should be enough. Hernandez, meanwhile, is expecting a fast-paced dogfight, which is exactly the type of fight he relishes in creating. \"I think he's going to try to bring it; Sean Strickland always brings it in his fights,\" Hernandez said. \"He always goes f---ing forward and he is always trying to take your f---ing head off. That's what I expect from him. I don't expect anything less. I hope [UFC] really gets the hint that I need that belt. I have answered the calls and I have taken out the guys that they thought would beat me. [Strickland] is a really tough guy so I'm not sleeping on him but as long as I go out there and do what I do best, I think I'm going to beat him.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.Just in case you didn't hear, apparently the Yankees are signing a teenager who'll take Major League Baseball by storm in a few years (he's in the international free agency class of 2027). Sarcasm aside, hey, it's possible he will. He sounds insanely talented. I just think it's stupid -- and does a major disservice to to the kid, more importantly -- to slap labels like this on a teenager. To what am I referring? Well, the Yankees have reportedly come to an agreement for an international signing of a kid by the name of Sebastián Acuña. He's a teenage catcher who has been described as having \"the power of Aaron Judge, the speed of Elly De La Cruz and the defense of Yadier Molina.\" That's it? What's wrong with him? Why can't he also pitch like prime Pedro Martinez, stop a speeding bullet and leap tall buildings in a single bound? \nGood grief. These kids (because yes, they are kids) have enough pressure and, especially here in the internet era, the burden is totally undue and can ruin their public reputations if they fail to set the proverbial world on fire nearly immediately stateside. Take Jasson  Domínguez. Think about him for a second. Do you get positive vibes or does he feel a bit disappointing, even to the point of the word \"bust\" bouncing around in your head? Domínguez turned 23 years old earlier this month and has hit .248/.327/.397 (103 OPS+) with 16 home runs and 29 steals in just 529 career MLB plate appearances. In comparison, 2025 NL Rookie of the Year Drake Baldwin hadn't even made his MLB debut when he turned 23? He debuted two days before his 24th birthday.\nHeading into Domínguez's age-23 year, he is largely considered a disappointment, especially to Yankees fans. Heading into Baldwin's age-24 year, he had never played in the majors and was considered promising. The difference? Expectations. A scout told a prominent MLB writer in 2019 that Domínguez is \"like [Mike] Trout,\" only \"Trout wasn't close to this good when he was 16.\" Another invoked the name of Mickey Mantle. They called him The Martian.Domínguez debuted late in the 2023 season and homered in his first game. He went 8 for 27 with a double and four home runs through his first seven career games. Team that with the insane Trout/Mantle comps, and now the expectations for this kid were at damn near impossible levels. \nDomínguez still has years (and years) of time to develop into a quality MLB player. He didn't need this nonsense hanging over his head -- just the same as Acuña. What a start to expectations, huh? We've got people dreaming of a Judge/Elly/Yadi hybrid.Man, he better be one of the best players we've ever seen pretty much from the start, right? No pressure. \nEveryone should just tap the brakes a little bit here. Sebastián Acuña will hopefully be a great MLB player for a long time. He probably won't be Judge or De La Cruz or Molina. He almost certainly won't be all of them combined. He'll be the first Sebastián Acuña.\n            ",

Saka, who will turn 25 years old in September, has a new long-term deal with the team coached by Mikel Arteta, locking him up ahead of his expected participation at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, where he will be among the biggest stars. Arsenal released the following statement:\"Our 24-year-old joined our Hale End Academy as an eight-year-old in May 2010 and has since progressed to become the leading goalscorer, assister and appearance maker in our current squad – with 78 goals and nearly 300 club appearances in all competitions. Bukayo made his first team debut at 17 in November 2018, before being named Arsenal Player of the Year in both 2021 and 2022. He was also named PFA Young Player of the Year in 2022-23 and was in the PFA Team of the Season that same year. Our forward was also named as England Men's Player of the Year for both 2021-22 and 2022-23. A leader of our forward line with his consistent performances, establishing himself as one of the best wingers in world football, Bukayo has won our Arsenal Player of the Month award more times than any other player since it began in 2012.\"\nWhile reports suggest his deal will be valid in the summer 2030, the length of the new contract was not revealed by the English side that have worked constatly over the past months to reach an agreement with Saka's camp. The English international made his debut with the Three Lions in October 2020, and since then he made 48 caps with the national team, representing the country at the 2020 and 2024 Euros and at the 2022 World Cup ahead of the upcoming tournament that will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada starting from June 11. \n\n        \n            \n                Arsenal show the nerves of title bottlers as blown 2-0 lead at Wolves open Premier League door for Man City\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the current 2025-26 season, Saka has already made 15 goal contributions (eight goals, seven assists) in 34 matches in all competitions, underlining once more his importance in the team that is currently leading the Premier League standings and ended up in the top place of the Champions League's league phase. After winning the 2020 FA Cup and FA Community Shield in 2020 and 2023, it's now time for Saka and Arteta's team to bring back to the Emirates Stadium the first Premier League trophy in more than 20 years, as the last one was back in 2004 under Arsene Wenger's management. \n            \n",

The      latest   news, a       historical        question,            thoughts         about         the  future  of           baseball,   all      sorts of     stuff. Last week we picked our favorite MLB broadcasters. This week we're going to tackle Shohei Ohtani's greatness.Is Shohei Ohtani the greatest player ever?R.J. Anderson: Yes, and I don't think there's a compelling argument to be made to the  contrary. We've never seen a professional player simultaneously hit and  pitch for this long at these levels. That's without taking into account  that Ohtani is playing against the best competition the sport has ever  seen. It's also without acknowledging that he's doing it while his  opponents have more access to video, data, and other technology than at  any point prior. Ohtani should've been overexposed by now -- physically  or otherwise. The fact that he's not tells you all you need to know.  Matt Snyder: I've been saying for years that he's the most talented player in MLB  history. I don't even think there's a discussion on that, given the  two-way success in a much more difficult era than anyone else has even  come close to matching. Through that lens, it's fair to say that he's  the best player ever. Perhaps I'm getting too pedantic here, but  \"greatest\" player ever feels like it needs more of a longevity component  for me. Willie Mays has 23 years on his resume, as does Henry Aaron. We  can just use those two and underline the point by saying Ohtani has  nine MLB seasons. Even if we loop in his work in Japan's NPB, that's 13  seasons.   Mike Axisa: I think so. He's clearly the most talented player ever. I'm not sure there's an argument to be made otherwise. Pitching and hitting at this high a level has never been done before (no one's even come close). I understand the longevity argument for \"greatest ever\" and yes, I wish he had 20 years in the league, but I don't think we'll ever see another player like Ohtani in our lifetimes. He is 1 of 1 and that to me is enough to get the \"greatest ever\" title.\nDayn Perry: Yeah, I guess any answer flows from how you define  \"greatest.\" I sort of lean toward Snyder's viewpoint. I think Ohtani's  two-way excellence in the contemporary era, when the sport is played at  its highest and most competitive level ever, is the greatest and most  impressive achievement in the history of baseball. Does that make him  the greatest ever? Maybe. Personally, though, I want to see him amass a  larger body of work before calling him the GOAT. That shouldn't take too  long, at least if he maintains his recent level for a bit longer. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The middle of February may seem too early for Fantasy Football projections. 'Seem' may not be a strong enough word in that first sentence. Free agency is right around the corner, but the NFL Draft won't happen for two more months. It is way too early. But that doesn't mean it isn't helpful to take a snapshot before things get crazy.One of the big questions at wide receiver is whether this position as a whole rebounds in 2026. Last year, only nine wide receivers averaged more than 15 Fantasy points per game, and one of them was Rashee Rice, who only played eight games. Of the 11 wide receivers who averaged 13 to 14 FPPG, four of them played 10 games or fewer. To put that in context, in 202,4 we had 18 wide receivers who averaged at least 15 FPPG and another 13 who scored 13-14. The answer is that I do expect a bounce-back season, as I already have 13 wide receivers projected for 15 FPPG, even without projecting any of the potential free agents.Even amongst those top 13, there are some pretty significant tier breaks. Ja'Marr Chase and Amon-Ra St. Brown are in a tier of their own, with Rice, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Puka Nacua, and Drake London forming a clearly delineated Tier 2. It's in Tier 3 that we find several guys with the ability to produce elite numbers, but too many question marks to project them there now. Will Justin Jefferson get better quarterback play?Will CeeDee Lamb have to share with George Pickens again?Will A.J. Brown still be on the Eagles?\nWill Zay Flowers or Nico Collins see a boost in targets or touchdowns?Will Malik Nabers be 100% recovered from his torn ACL?These are the questions we will try to answer in the next six months as we sort out the first two rounds of Fantasy Football drafts.It is probably worth mentioning the names you don't see in the projections below. Pickens, Tyreek Hill, Mike Evans, Alec Pierce, and Jauan Jennings are just a few of the free-agent wide receivers I haven't projected yet because we don't know where they'll be playing in 2026. Pickens is the only one from this group who has a chance of cracking the top 12, and Evans is the most likely to end up in the top 24, but that is no guarantee.I also won't add any rookies to the projections until the 2026 NFL Draft. I am expecting Carnell Tate, Jordyn Tyson, and Makai Lemon all crack the top 48 as soon as they are drafted, and if they land in the right spot, they could go much higher than that. While this position was a disappointment in the NFL last year, when it comes to the 2026 rookies, wide receiver looks like the bright spot of this class.\nHere are my way-too-early projections at wide receiver 2026:\n            ",

Cole was charged with reckless driving and speeding-maximum limits while Ikinnagbon faces misdemeanor charges of reckless driving, following too closely and speeding-maximum limits.Both players posted bond shortly after their bookings.\"We are aware of the charges and are actively gathering additional information,\" a Georgia team spokesperson said about the arrests. \"As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will not be providing further comment at this time.\"One of the Bulldogs' top pass rushers last season, Cole finished with 59 tackles, a team-high 4.5 sacks and two pass breakups playing alongside 2026 NFL Draft hopeful CJ Allen.\nOver 20 people associated with Georgia's football program have been arrested for driving-related offenses since January 2023. Last March, Nitro Tuggle was arrested on charges of reckless driving and speeding after being clocked at 107 miles per hour, a few days after Georgia offensive lineman Marques Easley was involved in a crash at Athens Ridge Apartments, per the Athens Banner-Herald.Georgia's driving-related incidents since January 2023January 2023: Georgia football staffer Chandler LeCroy and offensive lineman Devin Willock were killed in a single-car crash that also injured offensive lineman Warren McClendon and recruiting staffer Victoria Bowles. February 2023: Georgia linebacker Jamon Dumas-Johnson was arrested on misdemeanor charges of racing on highway/streets and reckless driving for an incident that occurred on Jan. 10, one day after Georgia's win against TCU in the College Football Playoff National Championship. February 2023: Offensive lineman Aliou Bah was stopped for driving 65 miles per hour in a 45-MPH zone and received 12 months' probation. February 2023: Wide receiver De'Nylon Morrissettee was stopped for driving 81 MPH in a 45-MPH zone. February 2023: Edge rusher Marvin Jones Jr. was stopped for driving 93 MPH in a 65-MPH zone. March 2023: Former defensive lineman Jalen Carter was booked on misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and racing in relation to the January 2023 incident that resulted in the death of LeCroy and Willock.

    "body": "\n        There is no questioning the ability of Kansas guard Darryn Peterson, whom many believe is the frontrunner to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. But there are -- and will continue to be after yet another early exit Wednesday in an 81-69 victory over Oklahoma State, in which he did not appear in the game's final 17.5 minutes -- questions about his availability, which now linger as the biggest hindrance to KU's national title hopes.It's not just that he has played in 15 of KU's 26 games this season, owing to quad cramping, a hamstring strain and an ankle injury. It's that of those 15 appearances, he has now also left early in three games -- BYU, Iowa State and most recently the OSU game. He was also a stunning last-minute DNP last week vs. No. 1 Arizona due to flu-like symptoms despite participating in warm-ups. (Kansas won the game without him, 82-78.)Up until Wednesday, Peterson's various ailments and injuries were largely defensible, even if defending him seemed increasingly hard to do. The ankle injury looked significant enough to warrant a missed game. The hamstring injury was absolutely legit, KU coach Bill Self emphatically said earlier last week. And let's extend some grace and say the flu-like symptoms were bad enough to miss a home game vs. the No. 1 team. Fine.Peterson tapping himself out Wednesday vs. Oklahoma State and checking out with 17:22 remaining -- and never seeing the floor again -- reached the point of indefensible. Postgame, even Self seemed like he was fed up trying to fend off detractors. \n\"I didn't anticipate that tonight at all,\" Self said, noting that Peterson tapping out for games has happened more than a couple of times at this point. \"I thought he was good to go. But, obviously, we only got 18 minutes out of him.\"Self said squeezing 18 minutes out of Peterson was \"disappointing,\" because, well, duh; he is a spectacular, game-changing talent when available. He finished the game with a team-high 23 points despite playing the sixth-most minutes of the eight Jayhawks who appeared in the game. But it is also disappointing because Peterson's availability, or lack thereof, is undeniably obstructing the team's ability to have any semblance of continuity. It's hard to plan for the next half, much less the next game, when you don't know if your best player is going to have a cramping episode. (To say nothing, of course, about the inevitable distraction his saga has become.)\nSelf's positive takeaway from Peterson's extended absence to end the game laid bare the dire situation in which his best player has stuck him. The only good thing about Peterson being unavailable, Self said postgame, was that KU's roster has gotten used to the will-he-or-won't-he play sideshow. \"One thing about it is that it's happened often enough that our guys have learned to play without him, even though that's not the way we want to play.\" Self said. \"But that's certainly something that we're not unaccustomed to right now.\"That's not only a sub-optimal situation for Self and his staff, but all of this also feels unsustainable. You have a superstar player checking out of games unexpectedly, and -- fair or not -- appearing to quit on his team. Self juggling this without a full-blown locker room mutiny is but a minor miracle. \nSelf said after the game Peterson was going to come out regardless of whether he buried the 3-pointer with just over 17:30 remaining in the second half. He also said he was wholly unaware that he was going to be done for the night. Even for a Hall of Fame coach in Self, this feels like an inflection point. Compare it with the situation in the SEC across the country Wednesday, where Arkansas guard Darius Acuff scored 49 points and played a team-high 50 minutes despite wearing a walking boot in the two days leading up to the game, and it's hard to come to any conclusion other than Peterson is more interested in protecting his draft stock than playing for his team.But what is Self's recourse here, really? There are five regular-season games and KU is in the Big 12 title hunt. Sit him, and you risk losing Peterson. Whose to say he wouldn't just shut himself down? Play him, though, and you might continue inviting the circus into your own locker room. He's been productive, to be clear, but the numbers also suggest KU might be better off just rolling with the players who clearly want to play.\nDarryn PetersonOn courtOff courtDifferenceTotal net rating14.413.3+1.1Offensive net rating116.1114.3+1.8Defensive net rating 101.7101.0+0.6If Peterson's inability to finish vs. BYU on Jan. 31 was a red flag, his 24 minutes Saturday vs. Iowa State simply elevated the alarm bells, though Self said the ISU game curtain call was his own doing. Eighteen minutes Wednesday vs. OSU -- and tapping out with 17:22 remaining -- is a five-alarm fire that can no longer be ignored.\"I thought we were past it, but obviously we're not,\" Self said. \"It's certainly a concern. You get into the NCAA Tournament and you're playing a team just as good as you, you need to have all your best players available. All it takes is for one day like that to derail not only a game, but a season. So yeah, it's concerning.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Officials from the Boston suburb of Foxborough said this week that they could cancel World Cup matches at Gillette Stadium if they do not receive assurances that the town will not be on the hook for security costs, arguing that the burden cannot be on local taxpayers to foot the bill.Security costs in Foxborough, which will host seven games in the summer, come out to $7.8 million, with town officials unsure where exactly it will come from. There was a presumption at one point that the Kraft Group, which owns Gillette Stadium, would cover the costs but it will not do so because it is essentially renting out the venue to FIFA for the World Cup, according to the Boston Business Journal. Michael Loynd, the president of Boston's World Cup host city committee, said his organization is \"contractually obligated\" to handle public safety costs, something all 11 U.S. host cities will receive help with. The U.S. host cities will jointly receive $625 million in federal funding for security bills, though Foxborough officials said the timeline associated with receiving a federal grant is unhelpful.\"Our issue quite honestly is grants don't really work for us in the sense of timing,\" Bill Yukna, a member of Foxborough's select board, told the Boston Globe last week. \"We obviously would have to pay all the officers and any of the [new capital] purchases before the grant would reimburse us.\"On Tuesday, though, Foxborough officials said they would withhold an essential entertainment license if they do not receive an answer on the funding question, which they expected to be resolved on Jan. 30. The deadline for the license is March 17, leaving the relevant parties just a handful of weeks to resolve the dispute.\n\nThe town has yet to order major security equipment needed during the World Cup and is waiting for a reimbursement before doing so, according to CBS News.\n\"The money has to be here,\" Yukna said Tuesday. \"Everyone thinks we have a football stadium in this town. But with that being said we're a small town. We have 18,000 people … It comes down to sounding like Foxboro is being the bad guys here, but we really aren't. All we're trying to do is protect our citizens.\"Despite the conflict, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey believes the issue will be resolved in a timel manner.\"There's going to be a lot of burden on local folks,\" she told reporters Wednesday. \"We just gotta make sure that expenses are taken care of because cities and towns are already burdened enough … This is going to go forward. It's gonna be great.\"\nGillette Stadium will host five group stage matches, including a matchup between England and Ghana on June 23 and a fixture between Norway and France three days later, as well as a round of 32 match on June 29 and a quarterfinal match on July 9.Boston World Cup match scheduleJune 13: Haiti vs. Scotland (Group C)June 16: Intercontinental playoff path 2 winner vs. Norway (Group I)June 19: Scotland vs. Morocco (Group C)June 23: England vs. Ghana (Group L)June 26: Norway vs. France (Group I)June 29: Round of 32 matchJuly 9: Quarterfinal match\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Georgia was almost the destination for Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza. The former Indiana quarterback revealed this week his Christmas Eve 2024 commitment to Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers nearly went in another direction.Courted by several elite programs after making 19 quality starts over two seasons at California with 4,712 yards passing and 30 touchdowns, Mendoza was a four-star transfer in the 2025 portal cycle as the fourth-best quarterback available.\"I think there was one time even where I was about to call Kirby to commit to Georgia and the call didn't go through,\" Mendoza said on 96.7 The Ticket. \"And I thought, 'Alright, let me sleep on it tonight.' I really believed God helped me with that.\"After missing out on Mendoza in their transfer class, the Bulldogs rolled with Gunner Stockton as their starter en route to a conference championship and College Football Playoff appearance. \n\"Really, what it came down to was Indiana and Georgia,\" Mendoza said. \"Kirby, great recruiter, great coach, great program.  They were this close to making a national championship. I was really going back and forth between the two. And honestly, I was really confused. I was lost in the sauce because they were both great situations. It was a win-win. It was a really tough decision.\"As Cignetti's prized win in the portal, Mendoza went on to shatter numerous program records en route to Indiana's first national championship as college football's most-decorated individual.Mendoza was Cignetti's fifth different starting quarterback in each of the past five years, all earning all-conference or All-American status at James Madison and Indiana.\n\"He was an easy guy to evaluate,\" Cignetti said last season of Mendoza during the Hoosiers' rise to No. 1. \"There's a lot of physical talent there. He's tall, he's smart, he's got a quick release, he can make all the throws, he's mobile. When he got here we had to settle him down a bit in the pocket, work on his footwork and processing a little bit, and just calm him down in a little bit in the pocket, because he didn't have the best protection at Cal.\"Mendoza is projected to be the No. 1 overall selection by the Las Vegas Raiders in April's 2026 NFL Draft. Mendoza opted to skip a senior season with the Hoosiers after finishing with 3,535 yards passing, 41 touchdowns and six interceptions last season, highlighted by a near-perfect showing in the CFP.Mendoza had more touchdown passes (8) than incompletions (5) during playoff wins over Alabama and Oregon before his memorable, fourth-down scoring run against Miami in the national championship game that pushed the Hoosiers' lead to 10 points with 9:18 to play.\nMendoza juked a Miami defender at the line of scrimmage and bounced off two linebackers at 5-yard line before weaving his way into the end zone with a diving touchdown.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        North Dakota State has operated like an FBS program for nearly two decades.Now, it's about to become one ... and quickly. The race to prepare for its July 1 move to the Mountain West is as much financial as logistical, but the Bison believe they are positioned to compete immediately in college football's top subdivision after quietly securing $25 million in donor commitments while administrators worked furiously behind the scenes in recent months to finalize the deal.Industry chatter intensified over the last two months, particularly during the NCAA Convention in mid-January when rumors surfaced that Mountain West presidents had met with NDSU officials. Still, much of the maneuvering remained cloaked in secrecy, limited to a small circle of executives and boosters charged with ensuring the program would not simply survive the jump, but contend from the outset.\"It was a little bit of a roller coaster,\" NDSU athletics director Matt Larsen told CBS Sports. \"There'd be days like, 'Oh, we're getting this thing done.' And then there were days like, 'Boy, this thing's dead in the water.'\"Momentum accelerated in early February as key donors were briefed on the talks and moved quickly to raise funds to offset roughly $17.5 million in entry fees, along with millions more in anticipated costs tied to scholarships, facility upgrades, expanded operations, NIL investment and staffing increases.\n\"We spent the last number of years saying, 'If an opportunity comes, we're ready from Day 1,'\" Larsen said. \"We've always kind of felt we're an FBS program in FCS clothing.\"Administrators and boosters outlined their aggressive plan to CBS Sports. A doubling of the football operations budget from $8 millionA doubling of the NIL budget from $1 million to at least $2 millionTwenty-two additional scholarships to meet FBS requirements (roughly $600,000 annually)Additional recruiting staffNew offices for coaches and staff at the FargodomeRenovations to the FargodomeNew meeting spaces at the Nodak Insurance Football Performance ComplexSalary increasesIncreased travel expenses\"We don't want to just go in there and be a part of the league,\" said Derrick Lang, North Dakota State's executive associate athletic director for development and executive director of the school's fundraising arm. \"We want to go in there and win it.\"NDSU has spent four to five years circling this possibility, navigating shifting rules and rising costs. Three years ago, the NCAA raised the FBS entry fee from $5,000 to $5 million, creating another barrier for transitioning programs after a wave of moves by Liberty, James Madison, Jacksonville State, Missouri State and Delaware.\nThe Mountain West, too, had hesitated. Conference leaders were wary of adding FCS schools amid uncertainty surrounding College Football Playoff revenue distribution and tumultuous conference realignment. That uncertainty has since eased.\"We didn't know if that would lead to more change and didn't want to take the chance that if we committed to an FCS school transitioning, the goalposts would move,\" Nevarez said. \"The conversation has abated about changing those standards.\"On the field, North Dakota State has long appeared ready. The Bison have won 10 FCS national championships in the last 15 years, one of the most dominant runs in modern college football. But sustained success also bred complacency. Attendance declined, with a playoff game this season drawing just 10,464 fans to the 19,000-seat Fargodome.\n\"I never thought I would be at a place where winning wasn't good enough,\" Larsen said. \"We have an unbelievable fan base and the expectations are through the roof, but at that point we started saying, 'OK, is there an opportunity for us to play at the highest level possible?'\"NDSU has dominated the FCS level, winning 10 of the last 15 national championships.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Many realignment moves in the modern era are driven by television markets and desperation rather than geography.Sacramento State announced this week it will join the MAC, placing its nearest conference opponent 2,177 miles away at Western Michigan. The ACC stretched to the Pacific with the additions of Cal and Stanford in 2024. The Big Ten, once anchored in the upper Midwest, expanded to the West Coast by adding Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington. Even the Mountain West, scrambling to replace five departing members, crossed the Mississippi River to add Northern Illinois as a football-only member.\nNorth Dakota State seems to fit naturally within the Mountain West's footprint and competitive profile. \"They look a lot like Mountain West schools,\" Nevarez said. \"They just fit with us.\"Still, looming threats can also serve as a motivator for big moves.NDSU's decision was also shaped by larger forces reshaping college athletics. Many industry leaders believe the sport's largest programs could break away from the NCAA or form new super leagues that further widen the gaps among the bluebloods, the big brands and the have-nots. The threat of being left behind in the new iteration of college athletics is horrifying -- even for some of the most successful programs in the FCS and lower levels of the FBS.\n\"The line of demarcation for college athletics is 2032,\" Larsen said.  \"All of these major TV contracts come up. Is there going to be a new subdivision? Are you going to have a break off? Even if that happens someday, we may end up playing some high-level FCS programs, but in our mind we've had a six-year head start getting in here and being established. We just felt the timing was right, given everything that's going on. There is some uncertainty, a little bit of risk, but I really felt like it was a calculated risk in terms of positioning our football program.\"The ambition has been fueled by boosters like Tom Blattner, an NDSU alumnus who built a national construction and renewable energy business before reinvesting heavily in his alma mater. He gifted $15 million toward the Bison's recently constructed $54 million indoor football facility and stepped up again to help NDSU's move to the FBS in its \"Climb the Mountain\" fundraising campaign.\"I always wanted to see them compete at the highest level,\" Blattner said. \"If that meant moving up to the FBS, then that's what we needed to do.\"\nBlattner declined to disclose his latest contribution but said donor support has been widespread, helping generate $25 million in early pledges.\"The strength of the herd is the bison, and the strength of the bison is the herd,\" he said. \"It's going to take the entire herd.\"The move to the Mountain West might also reinvigorate the fan base, which has long been known as a frequent flyer, with thousands showing up for road games at schools like Colorado and also overwhelming rival fans at FCS road games. \n\"This is not about 2026 and '27,\" Larsen said. \"This is about 30, 40 years from now and positioning ourselves. It just seemed it was our time and a good investment in the future.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n         Around this time last year, Trinidad Chambliss was a relatively unknown D-II quarterback at Ferris State who flew mostly under the radar as the No. 843 overall player and No. 60 quarterback, per the 247Sports rankings, of the 2025 transfer cycle.One year later, he's a superstar after leading Ole Miss to the College Football Playoff. That's the type of out-of-nowhere surprise that's possible in the transfer portal era, where teams evaluate thousands of players on every level in an effort to unearth gems. And Last year's crop of surprise successes went well beyond Chambliss.Danny Scudero ranked as the No. 311 overall wide receiver of the cycle and led the FBS in receiving yards. Stephen Daley emerged as an All-American for Indiana. He ranked as the No. 829 overall player of the cycle exiting Kent State. Nadame Tucker led the FBS in sacks for Western Michigan after ranking as the No. 42 edge of the cycle. \nThere's value in the portal if teams dig deep enough. In order to identify some of the under-the-radar steals from this year's portal window, CBS Sports surveyed dozens of front office staffers asking for their value picks from the transfer 2026 portal cycle. Hundreds of players were recommended – and you can find 247Sports' full 100-player list here – but these are 15 names for Power Four programs to watch ahead of this fall. They might be reasonably anonymous now, but they could be stars by the time the 2026 season concludes. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Luke Dehnicke, TE, Northwestern Previous School: Minnesota DuluthTransfer Rank: No. 244 overall, No. 20 TEA 6-foot-4, 240-pound Division II standout, Dehnicke finished the 2025 season with an eye-popping 61 catches for 1,119 yards and 14 touchdowns. It's a huge jump to the Big Ten, but those across the FBS believe the 6-foot-4, 240-pound TE will do so ably.\"He is unbelievable,\" a MAC source said. \"Best receiving tight end I've ever seen. He'll be a first-team All-American.\"\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Michael Masunas, TE, Texas Previous School: Michigan StateTransfer Rank: No. 598 overall, No. 41 TEMasunas is considered a plus blocker with upside as a pass catcher. Michigan State didn't use him a ton in that role given the presence of Jack Velling, but he was very effective when given the chance with 19 catches in 21 targets for 232 yards and three scores. Given that Jack Endries earned 45 targets for Texas last year, there's a good chance Masunas could see a much higher volume of targets if he's TE1.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Devin McCuin, WR, Ohio State Previous School: UTSATransfer Rank: No. 533 overall, No. 97 WRThere are two things you want in a portal addition: 1. Production. 2. Athletic upside. McCuin brings both. McCuin's caught 152 passes for 1,696 yards and 16 touchdowns in his career. The 6-foot, 195-pound junior is also FAST, hitting a 10.54-second 100-meter time in high school. He's a playmaker in space who brings needed experience as a senior to the Buckeyes' room. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mason McKenzie, QB, Boston College Previous School:  Saginaw Valley StateTransfer Rank: No. 1,176 overall, No. 69 QBMcKenzie came up so often asking people recommendations for this list that I wonder if he really qualifies as under the radar. But I don't think people were grinding Saginaw Valley State tape from last year, so let's make a quick introduction. He's a D-II QB from the same conference Chambliss came from in 2024. He's a dynamic runner (942 yards, 5.9 ypc in 2025) and a productive passer. The early returns at Boston College are very strong, too. He'll be a fun Saturday watch for college football diehards.\n\"Sick arm, great runner, my sneak pick for this year's Trinidad Chambliss,\" said a MAC source.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kenny Ozowalu, Edge, Oklahoma Previous School: UTSATransfer Rank: No. 497 overall, No. 58 edgeOzowalu is exactly what teams look for in edges out of the portal. He's got good size (6-foot-4, 270 pounds), excellent burst off the line of scrimmage and production (6 TFLs, 3 sacks as a sophomore in 2025). He was a popular choice for front office staffers when asking for names.\"The speed and burst (he) plays with -- really, really good,\" said a source. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Aaron Philo, QB, Florida Previous School: Georgia TechTransfer Rank: No. 157 overall, No. 17 QBPhilo is more projection than certainty. He's thrown 102 passes in his two-year career for 938 yards on 9.2 yards per attempt. He's also averaged 5.9 yards per carry in limited action. Those are intriguing stats, and several front office staffers feel Florida got a relative steal with Philo compared to paying top dollar for the higher-ranked QBs of the cycle.\n\"Philo to UF is a huge win, and I think he will perform better than a good chunk of other transfer QBs ranked above him,\" an ACC assistant GM said. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kendrick Raphael, RB, SMU Previous School: CalTransfer Rank: No. 480 overall, No. 36 RBRaphel came up several times when checking with schools about their favorite under-the-radar backs. Raphel started for Cal last season, rushing for 943 yards and 13 touchdowns. Raphael created yards despite one of the worst run-blocking units in the Power Four -- Cal finished 132nd nationally in rushing yards before contact -- and could look much better in a different offensive context.\"I think he's going to completely change our team,\" said a SMU source. \"He might get drafted.\" \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ja'Marley Riddle, S, Georgia Previous School: East CarolinaTransfer Rank: No 400 overall, No. 31 SRiddle suffered an injury in ECU's bowl game, which may have contributed to him flying under the radar. But personnel staffers love his tape. The 6-foot, 182-pound safety is a sure tackler, covers a ton of space and has shown excellent ball skills with three interceptions in each of his underclassman seasons.\"Will be a good player (in this league) for a long time,\" a Georgia source said. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brock Riker, C, Penn State Previous School: Texas StateTransfer Rank: No. 730 overall, No. 45 IOLRiker emerged as a starter for Texas State as a redshirt freshman, recording a 71.7 PFF grade and not allowing a sack. The 6-foot-4, 290-pound Texas native has good size and moves really well.\n\"I fuc**** loved this tape,\" a Penn State source said. \"Screams NFL to me. Can bend, is strong and understands leverage and angles. Finishes.\" \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Flynn Schiele, WR, Cincinnati Previous School: Colorado School of MinesTransfer Rank: NANow this is an under-the-radar name. Schliele was a dominant D2 receiver between the 2023 and 2024 seasons, totaling 133 catches for 2,208 yards and 22 touchdowns. But then the 6-foot-4, 210-pounder tore his ACL early in the 2025 season. That took him a bit off the radar for teams. But the size and speed are among the best in the portal and some front office staffers consider him a real sleeper.\"Flynn is an NFL player if he comes back from his ACL,\" a AAC Director of Scouting said. \"D2 film was elite.\" \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Keaton Thomas, LB, Ole Miss Previous School: BaylorTransfer Rank: No. 275 overall, No. 18 LBCan a player who's totaled 100-plus tackles each of the last two seasons be under the radar? It's debatable. But Thomas isn't nearly as hyped as some other members of Ole Miss' 2026 transfer class and those in Oxford are really bullish on what he will do next season.\"He could be the best linebacker in the SEC,\" an Ole Miss source said. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Alex VanSumeren, DT, USC  Previous School: Michigan StateTransfer Rank: No. 179 overall, No. 20 DLUnder the radar may be a bit of a stretch for VanSumeren, who had a ton of love in the portal this cycle. Yet he's barely among the top 20 transfers at his position and played for the nation's No. 107 overall defense last year. A USC source raved about the addition for the Trojan defense.\"He's 6-foot-3, 255 pounds, dense and mean,\" the source said. \"That's one of the reasons we wanted him. At a press conference he said he craves contact like an addict. We had a bunch of 5-techs playing last year and didn't have enough 300-pound bodies. Our rush defense was in the 80s. He can take on double teams.\" \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Sahir West, Edge, UCLA Previous School: James MadisonTransfer Rank: No. 196 overall, No. 24 edgeWest is only a secret if you don't watch Sun Belt football, because he was a monster as a freshman. The 6-foot-4, 270-pound West finished the year with 45 tackles, 14 TFLs and seven sacks. Everyone wanted him. The relationships on James Madison's staff got him to LA.\"That guy is a dude,\" a Big 12 GM said. \"He's going to be a problem. He should be one of the best guys in the portal.\" \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jaquez White, CB, Virginia Tech Previous School: TroyTransfer Rank: No. 496 overall, No. 45 CBWhite came up a ton when asking staffers about their favorite under-the-radar cornerbacks. The 6-foot-1, 190-pound Georgia native finished the 2025 season with 67 tackles, 3 INTs and 11 passes defended. He also held opposing receivers to a 55.4% catch rate.\"I didn't watch all the high-level cornerbacks, but he was the best one I watched,\" an AAC GM said. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Preston Zachman, S, Indiana Previous School: WisconsinTransfer Rank: No. 729 overall, No. 69 safetyA name that received multiple votes for this list, Zachman is a little off the radar after an injury caused him to miss all but two games last season. Zachman's played a ton of football in six seasons (1,484 career snaps) and has seven career interceptions. He's almost always in the right spot and projects as a really solid football player for Indiana.\"Just a really, really good football player,\" a Big 12 Director of Recruiting said. \"Finds a way to make plays, smart guy. Always in the right spot at the right time.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA All-Star break is over. Action returns Thursday night with a 10-game slate. Every team has between 26 and 29 games remaining. So let's to lock back in and refocus on the second \"half\" of the NBA season. Some teams have already sent out messages like bat signals to show how they're going to approach the last two months of the regular season.The Sacramento Kings announced that both Domantas Sabonis and Zach LaVine will have season-ending surgery. It's a move that very clearly states the Kings will be tanking the rest of the season to prioritize draft positioning. The Dallas Mavericks did a similar move, announcing Kyrie Irving will not play this season as he continues to rehab from a torn ACL he suffered in March 2025. While that's happening at the bottom of the standings, we could be in store for some compelling finishes at the top of the standings with several teams within a few games of each other in both the East and West. As we resume the regular season, let's take a look at the biggest storylines post-All-Star break.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Jayson Tatum's potential return to the Celtics  When Tatum tore his Achilles in May 2025, it appeared the Celtics would take a gap year with their superstar sidelined. It seemed highly possible that Tatum would be out the entirety of the 2025-26 season, and that Boston would refocus its efforts around the 2026-27 campaign.  \nBut here we are nine months from Tatum's Achilles surgery, and there's hints that he could make a return in the coming weeks. The All-Star forward practiced with Boston's G League squad before the All-Star break, and took part in 5-on-5 scrimmages with Celtics teammates and coaches. Everything is lining up toward a potential return ahead of the playoffs.Boston owns a 35-19 record, and sits second in the East. There's a world in which the Celtics could make a deep run in the postseason without Tatum. Having Tatum healthy should only strengthen Boston's postseason hopes, and shake things up considerably in the East.  The race for the East couldn't be more wide open at the All-Star break. The Cavs are considered the favorites with +350 odds on FanDuel. The Celtics, Pistons and Knicks all have +370 odds.\nThe version we get of Tatum will greatly impact Boston's outlook for the rest of the season. If he comes back close to his All-NBA self, then every other team in the East should be worried about matching up with the Celtics in the postseason. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. How seriously do we take the Knicks?I don't think anyone knows exactly what to make of the Knicks, who entered the All-Star break having won 10 of their previous 12 but remain a defensively deficient team that will likely have to play the rest of the regular season without Miles McBride (who has been the lone Knick with a 100% approval rating this year).  Two big additions to watch: Jose Alvarado, obviously, and also Jeremy Sochan, who fell out of the rotation in San Antonio but could bring real defense and energy to a Knicks team that could use both if given any kind of opportunity.  \nWe're all waiting for Karl-Anthony Towns to find his range in what has been the worst shooting season of his career, but aside from McBride, Towns' plus-7.6 net rating is still the best mark on the team, per Cleaning the Glass. The defense is actually worse off with Jalen Brunson on the court sans Towns than vice versa.  Brunson, meanwhile, has been up and down of late himself. He's got two 40-pieces this month but his 43/31 shooting splits since Feb. 1 leave a lot to be desired. He went 4 for 20 and 0 for 8 from 3 in a 38-point loss to Detroit a couple weeks ago.  Nobody is questioning Brunson's offensive greatness, but it is a real question whether that's enough to make up for his own, and largely by extension New York's collective defensive ails, particularly if Towns doesn't get the shot going. All of these questions are happening in the context of what feels like the Knicks' best chance to make the Finals with this team. Can they seize it? These next six weeks won't tell us everything (anything can happen in the playoffs), but they will tell us a lot. -- Brad Botkin\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Can the Lakers secure a top-six seed?The Lakers sit 1 ½ games back of the Denver Nuggets for the No. 3 spot in the West. But they also sit just 1 ½ games ahead of the seventh-placed Phoenix Suns as the season resumes. Things are far from settled in the West. The Lakers are one of many West teams who could either host a first-round playoff series or have to earn their playoff spot through the Play-In Tournament.Having to go through the play-in isn't the end of the world, but when this team once sat second in the conference at the start of December, falling to seventh and having to potentially face Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs in the first round would not be ideal.The positive? Austin Reaves is back from a calf strain, and in the five games he's played since returning, the Lakers have gone 4-1. Having Reaves back is a night and day difference for the Lakers, who were relying far too much on Luka Dončić's offensive heroics and prime performances from a 41-year-old LeBron James. Reaves takes some of the offensive pressure of Doncic, gives the Lakers another guy who can create offensively and give you 20+ points a night. In just his second game back he had 35 points, showing that had it not been for the calf injury Reaves would've probably been a first-time All Star this season.\nThe have the eighth most difficult schedule over the rest of the season, but the Nuggets and the Timberwolves both have harder schedules, which could provide a nice path towards a top-four spot for L.A. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Can the Spurs jump the Thunder?Let's keep things in the Western Conference standings. San Antonio is my No. 1 team to watch down the stretch. They resume play on Thursday night against the Suns having won six straight and 11 of their last 14 and three games back of the Thunder for the West's No. 1 seed. They have every right to believe they can catch and pass OKC. For starters, the Thunder, who have lost six of their last 11 and will be without Jalen Williams for the foreseeable future, have the second-toughest remaining schedule, per Tankathon. Besides that, the Spurs own the tiebreaker with a 4-1 head-to-head record. \nIf this happens, how are we not going to classify the Spurs as the title favorite? What other No. 1 seed who has defeated the defending champs four out of five times and won potentially north of 60 games would be considered anything less?The Spurs are starting to feel a little like the 2015 Warriors to me. The ascent is happening before everyone is ready to fully accept it. They were supposed to be a few years away from contention. This year was supposed to about maybe getting into the playoffs and getting some experience under their belt. But Victor Wembanyama, like Stephen Curry when he burst onto the scene, has rearranged the geometry of a basketball court to such a degree that no typical timeline can be applied. He's a force beyond anything we've ever seen, honestly, and the Spurs are stacked behind him with every marker of a top-tier contender. Perhaps the top contender. That still feels premature to say, but if they jump OKC for the top seed, I'm not sure how you could call them anything other than the title favorites. -- Brad Botkin\n5. Tanking wars at the bottom of the standingsThe talk of the NBA over the last two weeks has been about the league's tanking \"problem.\" The league fined the Utah Jazz $500,000 and the Indiana Pacers $100,000 for \"conduct detrimental to the league.\" The Jazz were fined for pulling players in the fourth quarter on two occasions despite being in closely-contested games. The Pacers held players out despite them being healthy. Both were obvious efforts by Utah and Indiana to tank, something that the league is seemingly trying to come down hard on.\"Overt behavior like this that prioritizes draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in the league's statement.Since the league's punishment, there has been a lot of chatter about how to solve the league's tanking problem. Calls for eliminating the draft, setting lottery odds earlier in the season and holding a lottery tournament to determine who gets what pick have all been bandied about. But while everyone thinks they have the idea that's going to solve this issue for the league, teams will continue to tank.\n\n        \n            \n                How can the NBA stop tanking? Breaking down the internet's craziest solutions -- and why most would never work\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Wizards, Pacers, Nets, Kings, Jazz, Mavericks and Grizzlies have all essentially been eliminated from the postseason races already and want the best chance possible at the No. 1 pick. The Pacers and Jazz both could potentially lose their picks if they fall below certain slots.  One look at the collegiate basketball landscape this season and most front office executives are probably salivating over the prospect of landing Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa, Cameron Boozer or a handful of other high-profile draft prospects. This is being billed as one of the best drafts in recent memory. Of course these teams want to do everything possible to try and land one of these guys. People might say tanking is bad for the league, but, for now, it's a necessary evil for teams to try and find generational talent. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Cavs, Harden primed for a run  Three games with James Harden, three wins with James Harden, who had four assists down the stretch and hit the game-tying 3 with under a minute to play in Cleveland's victory over Denver last week.\nCleveland started to find its sea legs after Christmas. They Cavs had won 13 of their previous 18 when the Harden deal went down. Everyone has been waiting for the team that won 64 games last season to emerge, and it feels safe to say that it has. But the question is: How much better can the Cavs be with Harden?  \"I understand that this team is going to be something special [with Harden],\" Donovan Mitchell wrote in his latest diary installment for Andscape. \"We're 3-0 so far, so we're not doing too bad. But I'm excited to see what we do when we get some practices under our belt, and we'll see what that looks like going forward.\" \t \tWe've already seen some of the best of what Harden will bring. He's carded 26 assists in his three games so far, which speaks to the playmaking burden he'll lift from the shoulders of Mitchell, the league's fifth-leading scorer who should be as free as he's been all season to, well, score.   It's largely the same tag-team dynamic that existed with Darius Garland, but Harden is a better creator than Garland and, importantly, he's healthy. The combined gravitational force of these two has already been on display.   Watch here as Harden has the ball on the wing with Mitchell in the short corner, and how the whole defense shifts their way as Jarrett Allen (with whom Harden has already looked very comfortable in two-man actions) cuts straight down the lane.   Possessions like this one below should become more of the norm, with Harden collapsing defenses and making life easier on Mitchell, who is making 40% of his catch-and-shoot 3s this season, per Synergy.   With the threat of Mitchell keeping defenses honest on one side and Allen rolling down the lane, the opposite side shooters should get a lot of looks like this as Harden is a master at waiting for defenses to commit before delivering.   Of course, this is the best of Harden. Time will tell if the worst of him -- his defense, namely, and some of his postseason disappearing acts -- will bite the Cavs when it counts most. But for now, Cleveland continuing to rise up the Eastern Conference standings (with the league's fifth-easiest remaining schedule, per Tankathon) looks like a pretty good bet. -- Brad Botkin\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Rookie of the Year race between Flagg and KnueppelThis is one of the most intriguing Rookie of the Year races in recent memory, even if the oddsmakers view Cooper Flagg as a heavy favorite with two months to go (-750 odds at FanDuel). Both Flagg and Kon Knueppel have valid cases to walk away with the award, and on any given night you could argue that one deserves it more. Flagg is shouldering the entirety of Dallas' offense and has been among the most efficient rookies given the types of shots he's taking. His defense is also years ahead of where rookies typically are, and he's already shown he can be the go-to guy in the clutch.  For Knueppel, he's the best shooting prospect we've seen since Stephen Curry, and he's completely elevated Charlotte's offense. He's benefiting from the brilliance of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller, but he's much more than just a catch-and-shoot player. Knueppel's off-ball movement creates so many opportunities directly and indirectly, and he's about as automatic as it comes from 3-point land.  The first time these former teammates faced each other it was an absolute classic. Flagg had 49 points, while Knueppel had 34 points in the win. We'll get one more matchup between these two on March 3, and given how close this race is, perhaps it can help in figuring out who should come out on top for Rookie of the Year. -- Jasmyn Wimbish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. The MVP race just got interesting againWhen Nikola Jokić went down with a hyperextended knee right before New Year's, it looked like it would bring an end to his MVP bid on account of not being able to meet the 65-game threshold. But the Nuggets superstar made it back just in time to be able to miss exactly one more game the rest of the way and maintain award eligibility. As long as Jokić remains eligible, this is a tight race between him and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who has been out with an injury of his own as the Thunder have lost six of their last 11. Also lurking is Victor Wembanyama, who has missed 14 games so far and thus can miss three more while remaining eligible. SGA remains the betting favorite (Gilgeous-Alexander has -190 odds to Jokić's +300, while Wembanyama is currently a +3300 longshot).As mentioned above, San Antonio is a real threat to catch OKC for the No. 1 seed; they're three games back and own the tiebreaker via a 4-1 head-to-head advantage. Wembanyama's numbers considering he's only playing 29 minutes a game are crazy. Factoring in both ends of the court, he's probably the most impactful per-minute player in the NBA, and if the Spurs do claim the No. 1 seed it will be tough to not consider him seriously for MVP. Now add in Cade Cunningham, Luka Doncic and Jaylen Brown, and this race that once looked to be all but sewn up for SGA when Jokić went down suddenly looks like it could be in for a photo finish. -- Brad Botkin\n            ",

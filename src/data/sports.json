    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 11 schedule features nine divisional clashes. Among the biggest are Sunday, when the AFC West co-leading Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams face off as Sam Darnold looks to guide the Seahawks past Matthew Stafford and the Rams. Another key divisional matchup features the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos in a pivotal AFC West meeting. The Rams are 3-point favorites as both they and the Seahawks sport 7-2 ATS records, while Kansas City is favored by 3.5 points on the road.A non-divisional matchup with heavy NFC playoff race implications features the Detroit Lions against the Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5). Philadelphia has won the last two meetings, the last a 38-35 triumph in 2022. The largest Sunday spread has the Ravens (-7.5) over the Cleveland Browns. Lamar Jackson (knee) missed practice on Wednesday, but did return as a full participant on Thursday and carries no injury designation. Other big favorites include the Packers (-7) vs. the Giants, as Jameis Winston will start in place of Jaxson Dart (concussion) and the Texans (-5.5) vs. Titans, in which a concussion will also keep C.J. Stroud out.Before making any Week 11 NFL picks or NFL score predictions on those games or others, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over/under and money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game.

    "body": "\n        The Golden State Warriors picked up their second straight win over the San Antonio Spurs on Friday night in dramatic fashion with a 109-108 victory that saw things get a bit feisty between the two Western Conference contenders. Naturally, at the center of it all was Draymond Green, who tried some of his usual antics with Victor Wembanyama but learned quickly the Spurs' young star wasn't going to back down from the challenge. Green started jawing with Wemby and tried pushing him around in the early fourth quarter ahead of an inbounds play, and Wembanyama responded with a vicious dunk off a lob on the inbound pass before screaming in Green's face.\nThe dunk didn't count because they called the foul on the floor, but it was quite the response from Wembanyama, who continues to prove his \"dog in him\" levels are off the charts. Unfortunately for Wembanyama and the Spurs, this was the highlight of their fourth quarter as the Warriors were able to claw back in front behind a monster 49-point game from Stephen Curry to get the win. Wembanyama finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds as the Spurs came painfully close to pulling out a win in NBA Cup action.After the game, Wembanyama was asked about his demonstrative reaction to the dunk and explained that the way Green was talking to him made it necessary for him to respond in kind. \n\"I was not trying to prove anything to anybody, it's just, at some point -- just like anybody, if somebody speaks to you a certain way, you have to respond a certain way,\" Wembanyama said, matter of factly. \"That's just how it is.\" Spurs' Victor Wembanyama, center, dunks over Warriors' Draymond Green, left, and Jimmy Butler on Friday night. \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            He was then asked if he enjoyed the moment, with the reporter noting Green seemed to appreciate the back and forth.\"Did I enjoy it? Good question,\" Wembanyama said. \"I don't know, I'm not enjoying it now.\" \nWemby is always very wary of showing that he cares about anything but winning, but I do think in the moment, he enjoyed getting to give Green a bit of comeuppance. That was spoiled for him after the fact by the Spurs' loss, but even in defeat, Wembanyama continues to prove that he is not just the future of the NBA but a force in the present. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest FanDuel promo code gives new users $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Texas vs. Georgia is garnering the majority of the attention of the college football world on Saturday, but it's not the only game. The No. 1 team in the nation takes the field on Saturday, and although it's not going as far as to pick an upset, SportsLine's model is expecting a closer game than many may be expecting. The model has UCLA in its Saturday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook to hang around with No. 1 Ohio State, playing UCLA as 34.5-point underdogs. Ohio State is 9-0 this season, but the Buckeyes are 1-2 against the spread when favored by more than 25 points.The model has a best bet on the top-10 matchup of Georgia vs. Texas as well, backing the Longhorns as 4.5-point underdogs in its Saturday best bets at FanDuel. It is also backing Boise State to upset San Diego State at +106 odds in a 10:30 p.m. ET kickoff. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks.

The Bruins are 3-3 in the Big Ten, with two of their three conference losses coming in one-score contests. They are 3-1 ATS as an underdog in conference play this season. UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava was the No. 2 recruit in the nation in the Class of 2023, only behind Arch Manning, and although he hasn't fully lived up to those expectations early into his college career, he still has that potential. Ohio State is great, but UCLA can make enough plays to cover this margin. The model projects UCLA to cover the spread in 66% of simulations. Back UCLA at FanDuel Sportsbook:Texas +4.5 vs. Georgia (-115)Speaking of Arch Manning, he'll take the field as an underdog around the same time as Iamaleava. Manning is coming off two of the best performances of his collegiate career, throwing for 328 yards and three touchdowns against No. 9 Vanderbilt last week after a career-high 346 yards and three touchdowns the week before against Mississippi State. Georgia often has one of the top defenses in the nation, and this year is no exception, with a top-30 scoring defense in the nation. But No. 10 Texas has won each of its last two games against top-10 ranked teams heading into a matchup against No. 5 Georgia. The model projects Texas to cover the spread in 60% of simulations. Back Texas at FanDuel Sportsbook:Boise State +106 vs. San Diego StateThis matchup of the top two teams in the Mountain West will be a highly competitive 10:30 p.m. ET start on CBS Sports Network, with both teams at 4-1 in conference play this year. Boise State is coming off suffering its first conference loss of the season in a 30-7 final against Fresno State, which also snapped its three-game winning streak and six-game winning streak against unranked teams. That game was on Nov. 1, though, so the Broncos had time to regroup and prepare for this conference showdown. Meanwhile, San Diego State is coming off its first conference loss of the season, which came last week in a 38-6 demolition by Hawaii. The model projects Boise State to win in 66% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds.\nWant more college football picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\n        Between Nov. 5, 2023, and March 20, 2024, the New Orleans Pelicans could credibly be called sleeper contenders. That stretch, which began with C.J. McCollum returning from an injury, saw the Pelicans go 38-24. They had the NBA's third-best net rating in that window, trailing only the 2024 champion Celtics and 2025 champion Thunder. It was the one truly healthy window the New Orleans Pelicans have had since the Anthony Davis era and Willie Green was a meaningful part of it.We all know what happened next. Brandon Ingram got hurt in March. Zion Williamson got hurt in April. Everything went to hell from there. Now the Pelicans are 2-10, dead last in the Western Conference without their first-round pick this season, and Green paid the price for it. He was just fired.The decision, in a vacuum, was the correct one. The Pelicans have been lifeless since last season began, and while injuries certainly played a role in their downfall, the players who have been available haven't exactly fought to save their coach's job. The coach had no answers to maximize his weakened squad. The squad seemingly lost faith in him. It was time to move on. Green's coaching was a problem.It just wasn't the problem. It was a symptom of greater dysfunction, some of which has been visible only recently, but some of which has been apparent for quite some time. The Pelicans were poorly coached, yes, but they have been exceedingly poorly managed as well, so much so that it's hard to imagine any coach succeeding in New Orleans.\n\n        \n            \n                Pelicans fire Willie Green: New Orleans coach ousted after miserable 2-10 start; James Borrego named interim\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe roster mismanagement is obviously a significant part of that. Across two regimes, the Pelicans effectively traded Dyson Daniels, Larry Nance Jr., Brandon Ingram and three first-round picks for Dejounte Murray and Derik Queen within the span of about a year. Injuries mattered as well, and not just the ones that have kept players out. Williamson was playing like a star when he got hurt in that Play-In game against the Lakers. He hasn't really done so since, with a pretty concerning dip in field goal percentage at the rim. Some of that is random, just bad luck. But given the consistency with which these injuries have come, it's worth wondering how much of it should be laid at the feet of the organization.It's an organization that, aside from the brief period around the hiring of David Griffin, has been known for its reluctance to spend not only on players (they've never paid the luxury tax), but infrastructure. They are owned by Gale Benson, who also owns the New Orleans Saints, and the organizational crossover has been a major concern for quite some time. Saints general manager Mickey Loomis was technically the head of basketball operations for the Pelicans between 2012 and 2019. It is the only job he has ever held in basketball. That direct oversight seemingly ended with the Griffin hire, but some degree of overlap still exists, and it's not as though things have improved much since then.Take the process to replace Griffin after he was fired in April. That move was made official on April 14. They announced that they were hiring Joe Dumars three days later, on April 17, though reports started trickling in far sooner. There was seemingly no formal interview process in which other candidates were considered, an odd choice considering Dumars had not run an NBA team in more than a decade and was more than two decades removed from his 2004 championship.\nBut Dumars has seemingly had a relationship with ownership for quite some time, with rumors about his involvement with the organization dating all the way back to the Anthony Davis era. The hire, and more importantly the process, reeked of cronyism. An organization with its priorities in order considers a wide variety of candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds. If nothing else, it's worthwhile to bring them in and hear what they have to say, if only to take their best ideas and repurpose them for yourself. They're too dysfunctional for that and that dysfunction seeps into every element of the organization.Last offseason, Dejounte Murray appeared on The Pivot Podcast to discuss his first-year experience with the Pelicans. In short: it was not good. \"It was a situation where, like, I got all these problems going on… I broke my hand, I'm recovering,\" Murray said. \"My mom had a stroke, one of my cousins got killed, then my uncle overdosed… [During all this] I'm not getting what I need in the organization. It's hard for me to get my training time. It's hard for me to get lifts. It's hard for me to get my own court time. So, you can only imagine where my mental was at.\"Mind you, Murray is still on the team. It's rare for a player to be this honest even after the fact, but Murray is still going back to work in the same building every day. Dumars addressed the interview. He said \"it won't be a problem this year.\" We haven't heard from Murray since, but little that has happened in New Orleans thus far suggests that things are getting better. These problems have existed as long as the team has.\nThe Pelicans might walk away from the Green firing with a better coach (associate head coach James Borrego has been named the interim replacement), but changing coaches doesn't fix an organization. Look at Sacramento. Mike Brown came in, won Coach of the Year unanimously and was fired a year and a half later. The Kings have more or less returned to the abyss that he dragged them out of. Mat Ishbia has never employed a head coach for longer than a year. Organizational success starts at the top and unless Benson and the team's management shape up, there isn't a coach in basketball who will be able to turn them into a winner.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Land Grant Trophy isn't exactly a prize for the ages this year -- but it's still a rivalry game worth playing for when Penn State (3-6) and Michigan State (3-6) meet in a battle of winless Big Ten teams just trying to salvage slim chances of bowl eligibility in disappointing seasons. It marks only the second time in 14 meetings that neither side is nationally ranked. The Nittany Lions are a month removed from firing longtime coach James Franklin and nearly pulled off a stunning upset last week against No. 2 Indiana before surrendering a game-winning touchdown drive in the final minutes. The Spartans suffered heartbreak of their own prior to a bye week with an overtime loss at Minnesota, matching their longest losing streak in nine years. Penn State, meanwhile, has dropped six consecutive games for the first time since 2004.Bet Penn State vs. Michigan State at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Saturday's matchup will be the 39th all-time meeting between the two programs. While the Spartans have won six of the last 11 contests, the Nittany Lions have taken four of the past five to hold a narrow 19-18-1 edge in the rivalry series, which has been played annually since its inception in 1993.\nPenn State vs. Michigan State: Need to know  Quarterback situation: Michigan State coach Jonathan Smith plans to start redshirt freshman Alessio Milivojevic on Saturday, according to ESPN. Milivojevic threw for 311 yards in his first career start at Minnesota two weeks ago, ranking third-most by a freshman or redshirt freshman and fourth-most in any Spartans debut. Junior Aidan Chiles, who followed Smith from Oregon State last season, continued to split first-team reps in practice this week, per Smith.Record chasers: Kaytron Allen became Penn State's career leader in rushing attempts last week, surpassing Evan Royster (2007-10). Allen has 3,613 career rushing yards, just 319 shy of Royster's all-time mark. Meanwhile, Nicholas Singleton continues climbing the Nittany Lions' record books as well, tallying 41 rushing touchdowns and 51 total touchdowns in his career, putting him within reach of Saquon Barkley's all-time school marks of 43 and 53, respectively.Late down woes: Both teams have struggled in critical late-down situations against FBS opponents this season. Michigan State's offense converts just 37.4% of late downs, ranking 99th in FBS, while Penn State is more effective at 46.5% (33rd). Defensively, the Spartans allow conversions on 55.3% of opponents' late downs (92nd), and the Nittany Lions give up 54.0% (106th).\n  Where to watch Penn State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 15 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Spartan Stadium -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ PremiumPenn State vs. Michigan State prediction, picks  \nThe records may be the same, but the talent disparity heavily favors Penn State. While Michigan State has fought hard with a 5-1-0 ATS record vs. Big Ten opponents -- the Nittany Lions possess far more firepower on both sides of the ball. Last week's near-upset of No. 2 Indiana showed Penn State hasn't quit under interim coach Terry Smith, and quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer was decent, keeping the offense balanced. That could be key against a Spartans pass defense that ranks fourth in the Big Ten in yards allowed per attempt (7.6) against FBS opponents this season. With bowl eligibility still on the line and a chance to cap a tough season on a high note, Penn State should leave East Lansing comfortably.  Pick: Penn State -7.5You can bet Michigan State vs. Penn State at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nWho will win and cover in each Week 12 college football game?

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is here, and that means it's time for the rumor mill to go into overdrive. Below, CBS Sports has gathered all of Saturday's most notable news, moves, and murmurs into one convenient viewing spot.Latest on Phillies' plans for Schwarber, SuárezThe Phillies aren't expected to re-sign free-agent left-hander Ranger Suárez, and they're likely to be without ace Zack Wheeler, recovering from surgery to correct his thoracic outlet syndrome, at the onset of next season. Yet that doesn't mean the Phillies are in the market for another starter.\n\"I can't say we wouldn't,\" executive Dave Dombrowski told The Athletic. \"But, again, it's not our highest priority. … You have to be careful. You always need to look for starting pitching depth. That doesn't necessarily mean top of the market, but where does that fit in? Because you never have enough starting pitching, and really for us, after you get past (the top six starters) … now you're talking about (minor leaguer Jean) Cabrera, he would be one of those guys. But we don't have a lot of starting pitching depth, so that's something we need to be cognizant of.\"\nAs it stands, the Phillies would likely trot out a rotation consisting of Cy Young runner-up Cristopher Sánchez, Jesús Luzardo, Aaron Nola, Taijuan Walker, and prospect Andrew Painter.\nThe Athletic adds that the Phillies still want to retain slugger Kyle Schwarber. Members of the Phillies front office met with Schwarber's agency last week during the GM meetings.Astros interested in Cardinals' DonovanCardinals utility player Brendan Donovan figures to be a popular trade target this winter, given his track record (career 117 OPS+), defensive versatility, and remaining years of cost control. You can count the Astros among the interested parties, according to The Athletic's Chandler Rome.\nIn general, the Astros are known to want to add to their lineup. They ranked 21st in runs scored in 2025, though they did grade as a league-average offense through the lens of FanGraphs' park-adjusted wRC+ metric.\n\"I think we're going to be giving guys more of a break this year, and there will be moving parts, but when we move the parts, (creating an) offensive lineup is going to be a big focus,\" general manager Dana Brown said. \"When we score four or more runs, the team is really good. We want to put some more runs on the board.\"Mariners want to retain own free agentsThe Mariners, fresh off a disappointing loss in the American League Championship Series, will begin with them prioritizing keeping their own free agents, like infielders Josh Naylor, Eugenio Suarez, and Jorge Polanco.\"Our offseason is largely going to start with the guys who were on the team last year and try to bring as many back as possible,\" general manager Justin Hollander said earlier in the week, according to the Seattle Times.\nPrevious reports had re-signing Naylor top among the Mariners' winter to-do list. It's not yet clear if Seattle has made progress in those efforts. Angels seeking batsThe Angels ranked 25th last season in runs scored and 26th in park-adjusted offense. Unsurprisingly, one of their offseason priorities is adding to the lineup in a meaningful way.\"We want to be a more balanced offense,\" general manager Perry Minasian told the Orange County Register. \"There are some really attractive right-handed hitters that I'd love to have, that are just good hitters, that I don't necessarily think anyone cares if they're right-handed or left-handed. So does it have to be left-handed? No. Apples to apples? Of course, you choose left hand over right-handed.\"\nCBS Sports' free-agent rankings listed the Angels as a possible fit for several downmarket position players, including infielder Jorge Polanco and outfielder Harrison Bader. It's unclear if the Angels have or will have interest in either.The Angels are also expected to pursue pitching help, including a few starters to fill out their rotation.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The two teams that represented the SEC in the conference's title game face off for the third time in 13 months on Saturday when No. 5 Georgia Bulldogs hosts No. 10 Texas Longhorns in a massive conference matchup at Sanford Stadium in Athens, Ga.The Bulldogs got the upper hand on the Longhorns twice last year, winning 30-15 on Oct. 19 in Austin and then 22-19 in overtime in the SEC title game. Neither team can afford a loss on Saturday if they want to make the conference championship game this year. Georgia (8-1, 6-1 in SEC) already has lost to Alabama, while Texas (7-2, 4-1) has lost to Florida. In addition, the loser of Saturday's game will be in danger of missing the College Football Playoff. Bet college football Week 12, including Texas at Georgia, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three months of NBA League Pass. Click here to sign up:Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning will start for the first time against the team he rejected in favor of Texas. In June 2022, the latest quarterback in the Manning family committed to the Longhorns, picking them over the Bulldogs and, to a lesser extent, Alabama. That decision comes full circle on Saturday.Top sportsbooks have made Georgia a 5.5-point favorite over Texas. The line has rose up to -6.5 after opening at -5, but it now sits at -4.5 as of Saturday afternoon. So what should you make of all that line movement? Here's a look at the Georgia-Texas point spread, as well as the line movement on the other three matchups featuring two teams in the CFP rankings and one other game with a big line change. All times Eastern.No. 9 Notre Dame at No. 22 Pitt (noon)Open: Notre Dame -11 Current: Notre Dame -12.5The line movement in favor of the Fighting Irish makes a lot of sense. They are on a roll, having won seven consecutive games by 26.1 points per game. They also are in the conversation for an at-large bid to the College Football Playoff, so style points are important to them, which can explain some of this money coming in on Notre Dame. Also, the Panthers have struggled to run the ball this year (104th in the country, at 124.2 yards per game), which eliminates one of the ways the Irish defense can be had.Bet Week 12 college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:Texas State at Southern Miss (3:30 p.m.)Open: Southern Miss -7 Current: Southern Miss -3This game features the biggest line movement of any of the Week 12 games, and there's an easy explanation: Golden Eagles quarterback Braylon Braxton left last week's game with a right knee injury but returned to throw what would end up becoming the game-winning touchdown pass. Braxton, the Sun Belt Conference preseason Offensive Player of the Year, is listed as probable for Saturday's game, but bettors don't seem to be believers. Southern Miss (7-2, 5-0), which is on a collision course to play James Madison in the conference title game, has much bigger games remaining. The Bobcats (3-6) are winless in conference.No. 21 Iowa at No. 17 USC (3:30 p.m.)Open: USC -5 Current: USC -6.5This line touched Trojans -7 briefly before dropping back down to below a touchdown. USC welcomes another Big Ten team from the midwest to the Coliseum, and the Trojans have excelled in those situations this season. They have clobbered Michigan State (45-31), Michigan (31-13) and Northwestern (38-17) in L.A. this year. If the Hawkeyes fall behind early, this game could have a similar result.Bet college football at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 11 Oklahoma at No. 4 Alabama (3:30 p.m.)Open: Alabama -6.5 Current: Alabama -6.5This line opened at some spots at Crimson Tide -7.5 but has fallen to less than a touchdown. It opened at -6.5, went down to -6 and has since settled back at -6.5 as of Saturday afternoon. It initially seemed to be an overreaction to the Sooners' 33-27 victory last week at No. 14 Tennessee, but I have to admit that I haven't had a good read on Oklahoma this season. While the Sooners' defense has been elite, the offense has been average at best, ranking 64th in the country in scoring offense (28.9 points per game) and 77th in total offense (373.7 yards per game). That offense will face an Alabama defense coming off its best game of the year, giving up just three field goals to LSU.No. 10 Texas at No. 5 Georgia (7:30 p.m.)Open: Georgia -5 Current: Georgia -4.5This one has seen some major movement over the last few days, opening at -5, shooting up to -6.5 and settling at -4.5 as of Saturday afternoon. It makes sense that this one has seen plenty of betting action throughout the week as it's a massive SEC clash with huge CFP implications for each team. Are bettors back on the Texas bandwagon after its victory over Vanderbilt? Maybe so, as Manning has played his best football of the year over the last few weeks to keep Texas in the CFP conversation as a two-loss squad. The Bulldogs have won every game besides their loss to Alabama, but Georgia has played more close games than we're used to seeing from Kirby Smart's squad, beating Florida, Ole Miss and Tennessee by one score and not looking quite as dominant as usual. Georgia will also again be without Colbie Young, who's second on the team in receptions and receiving yards this season. He hasn't played since Oct. 18 against Ole Miss. Some things to keep in mind here are that Georgia is 35-1 at home over its last 36 games in Athens and Texas is 2-2 in true road games this season, losing at Ohio State and Florida and needing overtime to beat Kentucky and Mississippi State.\n            ",

No. 5 Georgia hosts No. 10 Texas, while No. 11 Oklahoma travels to No. 4 Alabama. These serve as de facto elimination games for the Longhorns and Sooners, both of whom have two losses.

They lost to Iowa by one, competed for a half against No. 1 Ohio State, and almost upset No. 2 Indiana last Saturday. You have to wonder how much do these players have left in the tank mentally after two emotional losses to Ohio State and Indiana. The loss to the Hoosiers was particularly gut-wrenching because Penn State came from behind to take a late lead before losing in the final seconds on one of the best catches you will ever see by Omar Cooper Jr.\"This is a tough spot for Penn State on the road laying over a touchdown. I can see a scenario where the Nittany Lions start off slowly and this settles into a close, low-scoring game. I like the Spartans to cover at home and potentially pull the outright upset.\" See what other college football picks Casale likes at SportsLine, and bet that line right here:How to make Week 12 college football picks Casale has found two other college football picks he loves, including backing an underdog in one of the week's biggest games where he says the line is inflated by multiple points. You can only see his picks at SportsLine, and you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.What are the best bets for Week 12 of college football, and which underdog should you back? Visit SportsLine now to see Thomas Casale's college football best bets, all from a proven college football handicapper, and find out. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said the NWSL's salary cap is \"the reason our league is the most competitive league in the world,\" defending",
    "body": "\n        NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said the NWSL's salary cap is \"the reason our league is the most competitive league in the world,\" defending the league's policy amidst reports that Trinity Rodman could leave the Washington Spirit because of the limitations of those restrictions.Rodman is in the final year of her contract with the Spirit and a return to the club could be tricky, according to The Athletic, over salary discussions. Any potential suitor is likely able to offer more money than the Spirit, including other NWSL sides, though Rodman's team have had talks with three different teams in England's Women's Super League. The player's representatives have also spoken with NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman.\"First of all, I think the NWSL is unique in that the players are actually employees of the league and so we we have a lot of direct connectivity with the players that might not otherwise exist in how people think about the infrastructure around professional sports leagues,\" Berman said in an exclusive interview with CBS Sports on Saturday, shortly after the Rodman news broke and ahead of the Spirit's NWSL playoff semifinal against the Portland Thorns. \"I spend a lot of time with individual players and agents. I think it's really important. It's one of the most important constituents who really underpin the game.\"Berman defended the existence of the NWSL's salary cap, which currently stands at $3.3 million per team for the 2025 season. The cap will increase incrementally each season and will reach $5.1 million in 2030.\n\"The reason our league is the most competitive league in the world, the reason that three of our four games in the quarterfinals went to extra time is because of the salary cap,\" Berman said. \"It is because there is a mechanism that forces our teams to be able to compete with each other. We do not want or want to facilitate haves and have nots. We want players to know that there's a consistency in standards that you can expect when you play in the NWSL and that is our superpower. We want any team to be able to win any game.\"It's important not just for the players to know that they'll need to show up and compete, but it's important for our business. No one wants to buy tickets to a game where you know the outcome before it starts and we want our fans, every single year when the schedule comes out, to believe that their team can win the championship or their team can win the Shield, and without a salary cap, that can't be true, so we have to know that.\"Berman said the league will \"continue to examine\" their current salary policies and looks to other leagues for examples. The commissioner, though, offered no specifics on whether or not any adjustments to the salary cap would be made, be it increasing it or adding something like MLS' designated player rule, in which the salaries of three players per team will not count against the cap.\n\"We always look at all of the other leagues in the way that their salary caps are constructed and luckily we have lots of leagues to point to here,\" she said. \"I do believe having come from those leagues that those are the differentiator and being able to build a long-term sustainable business and we want to make sure that this league is thriving and is the best league in the world, not just in 2026 but in five, 10, 50, 100 years and there needs to be a long-term lens on how you think about those things and if you look back in history over the last few years, we've quadrupled our salary cap so we're investing. Our owners are investing hundreds of millions of dollars and we want to do that in a way that's smart and supported by revenue growth and is done strategically.\"Berman also believes the NWSL is uniquely positioned to support players of Rodman's stature, both in terms of skill and star quality.\"I think there's so many compelling reasons for a top player in the world to want to play in the NWSL,\" she said. \"First, that any team can win any game. If you are a player who likes to be tested, who wants to be pushed to be your best on and off the field, to prepare you, in some cases, for top level international competition where you're not only playing against some of the best players in the world week over week, every single game, but also that you're playing in front of full stadiums consistently. That is the environment that you have when you're playing in World Cups and Olympics and we replicate that every single week, not just when the two top teams in a league are playing each other and I think that really matters. I think it matters for the maturity of a player, for the professionalism of a player, to be able to know in their minds that they can compete in those kinds of circumstances and that they can thrive under that kind of consistent pressure so we think that's super important.\n\"Number two, I believe we're the only league in the world that has consistent, bespoke, purpose-built facilities for female athletes. If you believe that women's soccer should and could be as big as any other sport, you have to believe in the long-term investment that comes with the ownership that we've assembled, not just in one or two teams, but literally top to bottom and more than half of our teams either have or will have their own training facility and many of them are either building or talking about building new stadiums where we'll be able to decide when we get to play for our players and I think I could go on and on, but those are sort of like two things that come to mind that are what I describe as superpowers. They are unique.\"She also believes the momentum that women's sports has in the U.S. creates unique opportunites for players to make the most of their playing careers, especially ahead of a busy period that includes a men's and women's World Cups in the next six years.\"If you are a star and a top player, I am certain that there is no other country that you could be celebrated as a cultural icon the way you will be in this country,\" Berman said. \"The catalytic moment that we have right now behind women's sports and the sport of soccer with the men's World Cup being, here with the Women's World Cup being in this region and with the Women's World Cup coming in 2031, the boom that's going to happen here on our soil is going to be unmatched and if I were a top player, those would be important considerations.\"\nFor her, that also includes commercial opportunities for players off the field.\"I mean marketability. I mean from brands, I mean being able to monetize your [name, image and likeness],\" Berman said. \"We know what's happening in college sports and that in many cases, the female college athletes are paid more than the male college athletes and that's also true in the professional world, like we're seeing it happen and so we want to be a facilitator and enabler for that because we want our players to make as much money as they can and we think that there's plenty of opportunities for that to be true in the U.S.\"What is Trinity Rodman's contract status?Rodman signed a four-year deal after her rookie season in 2022 worth $1.1 million, which made her one of the NWSL's highest-paid players. The deal included an option year for 2025, which the Spirit exercised, though the contract has now expired.What has Trinity Rodman said about her future?The forward has mostly kept quiet over the course of the year on her future, in large part because she has spent much of the season battling different injuries. Earlier this year, though, she did say she plans to play in Europe one day.\n\"'Ive always thought about playing overseas at some point in my career,\" she said in an interview with ESPN. \"I think I would kick myself if I retired and hadn't done that. So it's just a matter of when I think. But yeah, just focused on this year and we'll see what happens when the time is right.\"Which teams have been interested in signing Trinity Rodman?Chelsea and Arsenal were linked to Rodman last winter, the clubs reportedly monitoring her status because she was in the final year of her contract with the Spirit. It is currently unclear if they are still interested, especially Chelsea after they signed Rodman's USWNT teammate Alyssa Thompson in the summer.Spirit owner Michele Kang, though, said in March that it was imperative that the team – and the league – keep Rodman around.\n\"It will be very, very important not only for the Spirit, but in my opinion, for NWSL,\" she said. \"We're going to do everything in our power to hopefully keep her here. She's an integral part of our success, our success meaning the Spirit as well as NWSL.\"\n            ",

Oklahoma pulled off a road upset at Tennessee on Nov. 1 before having a bye last week, while Bama had a physical win over LSU on Saturday. One can't discount the rest advantage that provides the Sooners as Alabama has covered in just one of its last five games when it has a rest disadvantage. OU quarterback John Mateer is undefeated (3-0) on the road with Oklahoma and has 17 total touchdowns versus just two interceptions over his last six road games overall. The model forecasts Oklahoma to go into Tuscaloosa, Ala., and cover over 50% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nAnother prediction: No. 15 Miami (-14.5, 55.5) covers at home versus NC State on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Being at home is important to note for the Canes as NC State has lost both on the scoreboard and versus the spread in three straight road games. The Wolfpack's defense will be the weakest unit on the field come Saturday as it's allowed 41.7 points over its last three, while Miami's defense is the strength of its team. The Hurricanes rank 10th in FBS by allowing just 15 points per game, and of their last six home games, they've allowed a lone touchdown -- or no trips to the end zone at all -- in five of them. The model has Miami covering well over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 12The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 12, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a pair of ranked teams outright losing to unranked foes. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which ranked squads go down?

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs made it a point to heavily target Rashee Rice in his return from suspension with seven receptions on 10 targets for two touchdowns in Week 7. That resulted in a 31-point performance for Kansas City, its second-highest point total of the season, and it's no coincidence that Rice's involvement coincided with Kansas City's offensive success. With Andy Reid and the Kansas City Chiefs having an additional week to prepare for the Denver Broncos, the game plan could feature more creative ways to get Rice the ball near the end zone, leading the SportsLine Machine Learning Model to project Rice as one of its top picks for Week 11 anytime TD scorer bets at +125 odds at online sports betting sites. Rice has three touchdowns in three games this season. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 11 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Texans running back Woody Marks and Chargers running back Kimani Vidal to cash for Week 11 anytime TD scorer bets.Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 11 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 11 NFL picks. It can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest bet365 bonus code, where new users receive $200 in bonus bets with a $5 wager, whether it wins or loses.Best Week 11 NFL anytime touchdown picks:Kimani Vidal, Chargers (+130)Rashee Rice, Chiefs (+125)Woody Marks, Texans (+150)Parlay these picks for +1219 odds with a FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5 or more wins: (odds subject to change)Kimani Vidal, Chargers (+130)The sixth-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft has a touchdown in two of his last three games, including scoring last week against the Steelers. Vidal had one of his best performances of the season, rushing for 95 yards last week as he's become an integral part of the Chargers' offense with Omarion Hampton (ankle) out. Vidal played 93% of snaps last week, and although that's an outlier for him and nearly any running back in the NFL, the second-year runner has had a continued high workload, playing more than 70% of snaps in three straight weekends. He's also played at least 64% of snaps in five straight games. The Chargers play the Jaguars, who have allowed a touchdown to an opposing running back in back-to-back weeks. The model projects Vidal to score in nearly 50% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds.Click here to bet on Vidal as a Week 11 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $150 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Rashee Rice, Chiefs (+125)The Chiefs have dominated the Broncos in the Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid era, going 13-1 against Denver as a duo. Injuries and suspensions have slowed Rice's start, but the third-year receiver has 12 touchdowns in 23 career games, including five touchdowns in seven games over the last two seasons. Rice has scored in two of three games this season, and scored in two of the three games he started and finished last year before a season-ending knee injury. Rice has 26 targets in three games this season, including at least seven in all three games, and the model projects Rice to be a featured part of the game plan again. The model projects Rice to score in 48% of simulations, showcasing value at +125 odds.Click here to bet on Rice as a Week 11 anytime touchdown scorer at DraftKings, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Woody Marks, Texans (+150)The fourth-round rookie took complete control of the Houston backfield last weekend, and although consistently playing 80% of snaps may not be realistic, there is a clear RB1 in Houston now. Marks rushed for 63 yards on 14 carries for 4.5 yards per rush and a touchdown in a 36-29 win over the Jaguars last week. He played 80% of snaps and played 60 snaps in the game, 50 snaps more than Nick Chubb. He has four touchdowns over his last six games, with at least one score in three of those contests. The Texans play the Titans, who have allowed the most touchdowns to running backs this season (14). The model gives Marks a 53% chance of scoring, showcasing strong value at his odds.Click here to bet on Marks as a Week 11 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $150 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Want more Week 11 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 11.

    "body": "\n        Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is among the favorites to win the 2025 NFL MVP in his 17th NFL season, behind 25 touchdowns and two interceptions while leading the NFL at 269.7 passing yards per game. However, the Rams haven't played many elite defenses this season. That changes during the Week 11 NFL schedule when the Rams play the Seattle Seahawks, who rank sixth in scoring defense and fourth in yards per play. With this tougher matchup, and Stafford being listed at a number even higher than his NFL-leading passing yards average, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has Stafford Under 278.5 passing yards as one of its top picks for Week 11 NFL prop betting on Sunday.Along with Stafford's Under, the model is also backing a pair of Overs in Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. Over 55.5 rushing yards and Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf Over 53.5 receiving yards in its best bets for Week 11 NFL player props. The Steelers play the Bengals, who are allowing the most yards (426.6 per game) in the NFL this season, as a main reason to play Metcalf's Over for NFL betting with Week 11 NFL player prop bets. Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach Week 11 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, SportsLine's Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 11 NFL picks at various sportsbooks. They can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest Fanatics Sportsbook promo code CBSFAN, which allows new users to bet and get up to $2,000 back in No Sweat Bets in FanCash. Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Best Week 11 NFL player prop picks:Matthew Stafford, Rams, Under 278.5 passing yards (-115)Travis Etienne Jr., Jaguars, Over 55.5 rushing yards (-115)DK Metcalf, Steelers, Over 53.5 receiving yards (-112)Parlay these picks for +561 odds with a FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: (odds subject to change)Matthew Stafford, Rams, Under 278.5 passing yards (-115)Stafford, at age 37, is having one of the best seasons of his career, leading the NFL in touchdown passes (25) and passing yards per game (269.7) while throwing just two interceptions this year. However, after back-to-back games with at least 280 passing yards against the Saints and 49ers, he's set to face a significantly tougher defense with the Seahawks ahead on Sunday. Seattle is allowing the fourth-fewest yards per pass (6.4) this season, and has the No. 6 scoring defense (19.1). Davante Adams (oblique) is questionable, and although he's reportedly likely to play, he'll likely be less than 100%, which could limit both his and Stafford's effectiveness. The Seahawks have also held opposing quarterbacks to Under this total in four straight weeks. The model projects 235 passing yards for Stafford on Sunday.Click here to bet Stafford Under 278.5 passing yards at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses. Travis Etienne Jr., Jaguars, Over 55.5 rushing yards (-115)Etienne has gone Over this number in back-to-back weeks, rushing for 58 yards against the Texans last week after 84 rushing yards against the Raiders the week before. He's played at least 54% of snaps in all nine games this season, and after some questioned who Jacksonville's lead back would be entering the season, it's clear more than halfway through the season that the answer is still Etienne. The Jaguars play the Chargers, who are 26th in the NFL at 4.9 yards per rush allowed, and the model projects Etienne for 77 rushing yards on Sunday.Click here to bet Etienne Over 55.5 rushing yards at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses. DK Metcalf, Steelers, Over 53.5 receiving yards (-112)The Steelers play the Bengals, who are last in the NFL in multiple defensive categories, including total yards (426.6 yards per game) and yards per play (6.4). The Bengals are 30th in passing yards allowed (260.1 per game) and 28th in yards per pass (7.8). Aaron Rodgers threw for 249 yards and four touchdowns against Cincinnati in their first meeting. Metcalf finished just Under this total with 50 yards, but he's had at least 50 yards in three of his last five games to finish either Over this total, or right around it. The model projects another strong offensive performance from the Steelers on Sunday, with Metcalf being a featured part of that success, projecting the Pittsburgh WR1 for 62 receiving yards on Sunday.Click here to bet Metcalf Over 53.5 receiving yards at DraftKings, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Want more Week 11 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some popular NFL player props for Week 11.

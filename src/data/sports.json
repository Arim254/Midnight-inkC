    "body": "\n        The latest DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, and with a 14-game NBA slate on Wednesday, there are plenty of ways to take advantage of this latest offer. One of the Wednesday's top matchups features the Philadelphia 76ers hosting the New York Knicks in an Eastern Conference battle, and although the 76ers are favored in the latest Wednesday NBA odds, the SportsLine Projection Model projects the Knicks to win 60% of simulations, making the Knicks (+114) one of its Wednesday NBA best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook in a 7:30 p.m. ET matchup. The over/under for Knicks vs. 76ers is 224.5 points. The model also sees an opportunity to back another underdog to win on Wednesday, seeing value in the Atlanta Hawks at +164 odds to defeat the Charlotte Hornets. The Hawks win in 47% of the model's simulations, compared to the implied odds of 37.9%.

The Knicks are 9-2 over their last 11 games, which includes a 112-109 win at Philadelphia on Jan. 24. Meanwhile, the 76ers have lost two of their last three games. The Knicks are 8-3 over the last three seasons against the 76ers, which doesn't even include a six-game victory over them in the playoffs two years ago. The model projects the Knicks to win in 60% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Knicks to win at DraftKings here:Hawks (+164) to defeat the HornetsThere's no denying how well the Hornets have been playing lately, as their nine-game winning streak was snapped by the Pistons, who have the best record in the Eastern Conference, on Monday. However, despite a 26-29 record this season, the Hawks are 6-4 over their last 10 games and are currently playing some of their best basketball of the season. The Hawks travel to the Hornets, and ironically enough, both the Hawks and Hornets have better road records than home marks this season. Atlanta is 16-14 away, and Charlotte is 11-14 at home this season. The model projects the Hawks to win in 47% of simulations, compared to the implied odds of 37.9%, making this value too good to pass up on for Wednesday NBA bets. Back the Hawks to win at DraftKings here:Texas A&M (-6.5) vs. Missouri (-112)\"This feels like a good time to buy low on Texas A&M,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"The Aggies fought to the wire against Alabama, but that 100-97 loss appeared to take a lot out of them. A&M had no juice in the first half versus Florida, scoring just 19 points. They did wake up and score 48 in the second half, but it was too little, too late. This is a bad matchup for a Missouri team that struggles with turnovers and guarding the three-point line. I think Texas A&M rebounds from two straight losses with a big win at home here.\" Back Texas A&M to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Casey Wasserman will remain the chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee despite his appearance in the files on Jeffrey Epstein recently released by the United States government, the LA28 board's executive committee decided after meeting Wednesday.Wasserman, the founder of the major sports marketing and talent management company that bears his last name, has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but documents released Jan. 30 by the Justice Department showed Wasserman exchanged flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003. Maxwell would later be accused of helping Epstein recruit, traffic and abuse his victims; she is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.The LA28 board said it took \"allegations of misconduct seriously\" and consulted an outside legal firm to help examine Wasserman's interactions with Maxwell, which included the two discussing real estate and massages.\"I think of you all the time,\" Wasserman said in one exchange. \"So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"\nIn a statement from its board, LA28 said it \"found Mr. Wasserman's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented.\"\"Twenty-three years ago, before Mr. Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's deplorable crimes, Mr. Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation. This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell.\"The Executive Committee of the Board has determined that based on these facts, as well as the strong leadership he has exhibited over the past ten years, Mr. Wasserman should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful Games.\"One day after the Jan. 30 document release, Wasserman released his own statement.\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said. \"I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"In the days since Wasserman's name appeared in the files, several high-profile clients, including Grammy Award-winning singer Chappell Roan and former U.S. women's soccer star Abby Wambach have left the Wasserman agency.\"I have left the Wasserman Agency,\" Wambach wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \"... Casey should resign. He should leave, so more people like me don't have to.\"\nThe Wasserman agency represents several stars across the sports world, including Klay Thompson and Evan Mobley of the NBA, Geno Smith, Maxx Crosby and Trey McBride of the NFL, Giancarlo Stanton and Yoshinobu Yamamoto of MLB and Brittney Griner, Paige Bueckers and Breanna Stewart of the WNBA, per Spotrac.Several Los Angeles politicians have called upon Wasserman to resign from his post with the Olympic committee, per the Los Angeles Times.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Victor Wembanyama dropped 40 points against the Lakers Tuesday night, reminding everyone that yes, he's the most dominate player in the league on both ends of the floor. This performance should come with a asterisk, as the Lakers were without Luka Dončić, Austin Reaves, LeBron James and Deandre Ayton. If those four guys played, the game would have certainly been far closer, but it likely wouldn't have stopped Wembanyama from having a big night. He put up those 40 points in just 26 minutes of action.It was Wembanyama at his absolute best. Draining 3s (four to be exact), punishing guys in the paint with an array of turnaround jumpers, dunks and layups and taking defenders off the dribble with ease.\nFour blocks and two steals are what the box score showed defensively, and his presence on the floor deterred the Lakers from challenging him at the rim. But it was Wembanyama's offense that set the tone for the Spurs from the opening tip. Twenty-five of his 40 points came in the first quarter. And by the time the fourth quarter rolled around, Wembanyama was able to watch the remainder of the game from the sideline with a win easily in hand.\"What got me going was just honestly proving myself a point, proving my team a point,\" Wembanyama told reporters after the game. \"I'm not worried about us, not worried about me against good teams, but history has showed that I need to be worried about us against teams like this. So yeah, I mean, we don't just talk about what we need to do. We need to actually act.\"\nThe Spurs sit second in the Western Conference, and have rattled off wins against some of the other best teams in the league. But -- as young teams tend to do -- they've also been caught playing down to their opponent. Losses against the sub-.500 Hornets and Pelicans, and two close wins against the Mavericks show that this team isn't always consistent. Wembanyama wanted to show that the Spurs shouldn't be playing with their food going against a Lakers team without their top players.\"I was also pushing to go back, but I mean, they did the right thing by keeping me on the bench,\" Wembanyama said of sitting in the fourth quarter. \"We got to think long term. But yeah, these kind of games, you got to have the greed. I mean, every game you have to have this greed to want more every time, because you know at all times it doesn't matter who's on the court, it's somebody who's going to want to stop you from doing what you do out there. So you got to be greedy.\"Wembanyama's efficient 40-point outing was the fifth time in the league's shot clock era that a player has amassed that many points in 26 minutes or less. He also joined Patrick Ewing as the only other player to put up a 40-point double-double in that few of minutes.\nThe win pulled the Spurs to within 3 ½ games of the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder. A couple months ago it seemed impossible for anyone to catch the Thunder atop the West, but a recent 5-5 stretch in their last 10 games has opened the door for San Antonio. The Spurs have been the Thunder's biggest competition in the regular season, beating the defending champions four times already. If the Spurs somehow leap the Thunder in the standings by season's end, the conversation won't just be about how impressive they've been with a team this young, but also about can San Antonio be the team representing the Western Conference in the NBA Finals. With the way Wembanyama's been playing, it's not out of the realm of possibility.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Few voices in golf carry more weight than that of Rory McIlroy, so when he weighs in on whatever the latest hot topic among golf fans and pundits might be, folks tend to listen. As McIlroy arrived stateside for his first PGA Tour event of the 2026 season at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he was asked about the latest round of debate regarding The Players Championship and where it falls in the hierarchy of golf's biggest events. The Players has established itself as the premier event on the PGA Tour schedule outside of the major championships, leading some to believe it should be considered a \"major\" given its quality of field and the stiff challenge presented by the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy has long been a strong supporter of The Players as an elite event on the calendar -- even noting that he believes it has a better identity than the PGA Championship -- but he does not buy into the idea that it should be elevated alongside that tournament, the Masters, the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\"The Players is one of the best golf tournaments in the world. I don't think anyone disputes that or argues that. From a player perspective, it's amazing. From an on-site fan experience, it's amazing. It's an amazing golf course, location, venue. \"But I don't -- like again, I'm a traditionalist, I'm a historian of the game. We have four major championships. If you want to see what five major championships looks like, look at the women's game. I don't know how well that's went for them. But it's The Players; it doesn't need to be anything else. \"I would say it's got more of an identity than the PGA Championship does at the minute. So, from an identity standpoint, The Players has got it nailed. ... I don't think it being classified a major or not a major makes it any more or any less [important]. I'm still very proud to have won that tournament twice, as I'm sure all the other champions are. It stands on its own without the label.\" McIlroy is a two-time winner at The Players, a five-time major champion, and as of last April, a career grand slam winner, so his perspective on the matter is valued.What McIlroy said about The Players having a stronger identity than the PGA Championship is from which much of the \"major\" debate stems. To that end, McIlroy suggested the PGA should flip back on the schedule, once again becoming the final major on the calendar.\"I think glory's last shot,\" said McIlroy when asked what identity the tournament should take. \"I think it needs to go back to August.\"The PGA Championship moved from August to May in 2019 with The Players moving from May to March. The PGA is often viewed as the fourth major, largely because it lacks the same unquestioned identity as the other three.\nThe Masters is staged at an iconic location each year at Augusta National Golf Club, kicking off the major season. The U.S. Open stakes its reputation on being golf's toughest test -- for better or worse -- and The Open is the oldest championship, one that shines a light on links golf. The PGA would push back on McIlroy's claim by stating its identity is being the \"strongest field in golf\" as it invites the top 100 players in the world without any amateurs competing. McIlroy believes it was better positioned as the last opportunity for players to capture a major championship each season. As for The Players, adding the \"major\" label could threaten what has made it such a beloved tournament. It stands out as the PGA Tour's flagship event, and it gets the early spotlight to itself in March. If it were to become a major, the Masters would likely insist The Players moves to May (PGA to August) to ensure the green jacket continues to be awarded first.\nThe Players nevertheless feels like a major, especially when it's at its best. It has a purse equivalent to one, too, without the added pressure. If it were to become a \"major,\" it would face similar challenges to the PGA, including the annual discourse about whether the event is worthy based on how exciting it plays.The truth is that The Players doesn't need the label to carry its own weight; in fact, not being attached to the majors works in its favor.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        What a difference a year makes. Matthew Stafford's future with the Los Angeles Rams was uncertain because of his dissatisfaction with his contract this time a year ago. The Rams gave Stafford's agent, CAA Football's Jimmy Sexton, permission to talk to other NFL teams to gauge the quarterback's market value, opening the door for a potential trade because the parties hadn't seen eye to eye about his contract in quite some time.Stafford put retirement rumors to rest at the NFL Honors on Feb. 5. He confirmed his return to the Rams during his acceptance speech for NFL MVP.Stafford was reportedly looking for at least $50 million per year in a renegotiated contract last year. The Las Vegas Raiders and the New York Giants were among the teams most interested in trading for Stafford. Cooler heads prevailed at the end of February as Stafford reached an agreement for less money than the Giants and Raiders were offering to stay in Los Angeles. The final two years of the four-year, $160 million contract extension Stafford signed in 2022, which had $58 million remaining, were renegotiated into a two-year, $84 million deal.\nStafford's 2025 salary went from $27 million to $44 million. The net 2025 increase was $12 million because $5 million of the original 2025 compensation in the 2022 extension was moved up to his 2024 contract year to placate an unhappy Stafford in July 2024 as the start of training camp was approaching.The Rams used one of the more unique structures with Stafford's contract. There were four different options each to pick up a dummy/voiding year starting in 2027 running through 2030 where each required a $6 million payment for option bonuses totaling $24 million.Stafford is scheduled to make an unsecured $40 million on a $48,266,668 salary cap number in 2026. The $40 million becomes fully guaranteed March 15 on the fifth day of the 2026 league year. It was an unsecured $31 million prior to the 2025 renegotiation.\nThe same concept as in 2025 is being used with Stafford's final real contract year. There are four more $6 million payments to exercise options for four dummy/voiding contract years from 2031 through 2034. The $40 million consists of a $16 million base salary and $24 million in option bonuses.The expectation is Stafford will be seeking another adjustment to his contract. The Rams may want to focus just on 2026 since Stafford is a year-to-year proposition at this stage of his career as a 38-year-old. Stafford's public declaration of his intentions wasn't necessary the best move for his negotiating leverage. He is coming off a career year though. Stafford led the NFL with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes. It's the first time Stafford has led the league in either of these categories during his 17-year NFL career. Stafford's career-best 109.2 passer rating ranked second in the league.\nThere are 11 quarterbacks scheduled to make more in 2026 than Stafford's $40 million. Six of the 11 are making over $50 million. Patrick Mahomes leads the way in 2026 compensation with $56.75 million. Josh Allen, Jared Goff and Tua Tagovailoa are next with $55 million apiece. Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts are making $52 million and $51.5 million, respectively.Green Bay Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons is the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback at $46.5 million per year. More than $9 million would need to be added to Stafford's 2026 compensation for his average since the renegotiation to top Parsons' $46.5 million per year. For example, an additional $10 million would raise Stafford's 2026 pay to $50 million and the two-year average to $47 million per year.Another approach could be a one-year contract extension in case Stafford wants to continue playing beyond next season. It would eliminate some potential headaches for the Rams since 2026 is Stafford's contract year. Given the way the 120% of prior year's salary provisions operate for franchise tags, it would cost the Rams $57.92 million to use the designation on Stafford in 2027 if he played the 2026 season under his existing contract. \nThe $97.92 million Stafford would make over the next two years with the Rams going this route could be used as a general framework for a contract running through the 2027 season. For instance, if Stafford's 2026 compensation is increased to $50 million as in the other example where there is $50 million in 2027, he would essentially have a one-year extension for $60 million given his current $40 million for 2026. The $60 million of new money for the one new contract year would put Stafford in a tie with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott as the NFL's highest-paid player. The four-year, $240 million extension Prescott signed in 2024 averages $60 million per year.Obviously, Stafford's fake 2027 contract year would become a real contract year in the process. The voiding date for the fake 2028 through 2034 contract years would need to be pushed back one year from the 23rd day preceding the first day of the 2027 league year to the 23rd day preceding the first day of the 2028 league year. The $50 million in 2027 could be unsecured, just like Stafford's 2026 money was when he signed his renegotiated contract last year. For the sake of consistency, the guarantee date could be the fifth day of the 2027 league year (mid-March 2027).\nIt remains to be seen how Stafford and the Rams will handle his contract situation. Maybe, Stafford will defy conventional wisdom by being content with last year's renegotiation. That would be the ideal scenario for the Rams. Nobody has ever made more from NFL player contracts than the $408 million Stafford has over the course of his career.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots came up short against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, but there are reasons to be optimistic about this team moving forward. Quarterback Drake Maye was an MVP finalist in his second season, running back TreVeyon Henderson was a finalist for Offensive Rookie of the Year and the Patriots' spending spree last offseason paid immediate dividends. There are new matters to attend to this offseason, and one objective to consider is an extension for star cornerback Christian Gonzalez. If New England had found a way to win the Super Bowl, Gonzalez could have had a claim to MVP, at least on the defensive side of the ball. He recorded four tackles and a game-high three passes defensed, and stopped big plays from happening on the big stage, again proving he's one of the best cornerbacks in the league. \nThe Patriots technically have Gonzalez under control for two more years on his rookie contract, including the fifth-year option in 2027, but he is now officially eligible for an extension. Does Gonzalez want to remain in New England long-term? He recently told reporters \"no doubt.\"\"This is where I got drafted, and I don't want to be anywhere else.\" Gonzalez said, per the Boston Herald.\nHow much would it cost to re-sign Gonzalez to a new deal? Spotrac predicts he's in line to sign a $80,950,992 contract that carries an AAV of $27 million per year. That hypothetical contract would make Gonzalez the No. 3 highest-paid cornerback in terms of AAV. The cornerback market exploded just last offseason. Carolina Panthers corner Jaycee Horn signed a four-year, $100 million deal, followed by Derek Stingley Jr., who signed a three-year $90 million deal with the Houston Texans. Then Sauce Gardner, formerly of the New York Jets, set a record with his four-year, $120.4 million extension that averages $30.1 million per year. The Panthers were able to save a bit of money by reaching a deal with Horn before the Texans and Jets could get their defensive backs to put pen to paper. If you're lucky enough to find a top-tier talent, it's typically smart to extend them right away. For example, if the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Patriots to the punch this offseason and sign corner Trent McDuffie to a lucrative contract, or the Seahawks decide to throw the bag at Devon Witherspoon following his impressive Super Bowl performance, New England could end up paying a higher price to keep Gonzalez. The Patriots are projected to have $42.7 million in cap space this offseason, which ranks No. 11 in the NFL.\nThe Patriots selected Gonzalez out of Oregon with the No. 17 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. He earned his first Pro Bowl bid this past season after recording a career-high 69 tackles and 10 passes defensed in 14 games played, and was named a Second Team All-Pro in 2024 after recording a career-high 11 passes defensed and two interceptions. Gonzalez's career started off roughly, as he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in just his fourth NFL game. But he's bounced back to be all that this franchise hoped for, and is set to cash in in the near future. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Six months into a season, it is not unusual to know what to expect from any given team on any given day and that was certainly the case for anyone who cared to check on Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday as they faced Newcastle United. A sluggish team who seemed a step or two behind the opponent in terms of intensity levels? Check. A porous defense that seems to lack chemistry? Check. An attack that has very few ideas? Check. Few redeeming qualities as the team slouched to yet another Premier League defeat? Check again.Thomas Frank, whose months-long spell in charge of the team finally came to an end after their latest drab performance, did not create all of Spurs' issues. He is right to point to the fact that he, like his predecessor Ange Postecoglou last season, had to contend with an injury crisis of epic proportions, all while captain Cristian Romero serves a suspension for a red card in their 2-0 defeat at Manchester United on Saturday. He was not wrong to note that this very team finished 17th in the Premier League last season, an admission that the ceiling is only so high for the current iteration of Spurs. Frank, though, did not do himself a single favor during his brief stint in north London, emerging as a rare example of a coach who truly earned a promotion to the big leagues but failed to prove his worth for the most part.Frank's tenure with Spurs is remarkable for all the wrong reasons, the Denmark native unable to live up to the billing in any real sense. He was supposed to be a practical alternative to Postecoglou, who spent much more time ensuring his team had a functioning attack than a competent defense. It was not the only issue the next coach should have theoretically fixed – his Brentford side were organized when defending set pieces and impactful on the flip side, a signal that Frank's Spurs would be efficient on both ends of the pitch.His perceived pragmatism, though, was mistaken for ability. Frank inherited a mess but he also failed to improve the issues that were fully in his control. There were very few categories in which Frank made a noticeable positive impact, an underperformance that is easy to spot regardless of how one chooses to define success. Averaging 0.1 more point per match compared to Postecoglou's Spurs last season is not much of a flex, and neither is making an improvement of 0.3 goals against per game when the team ranks 13th in the Premier League when sorting for expected goals against. If Postecoglou was reckless for allowing a porous back line to take shape despite boasting brilliant defenders in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, Frank is guilty of the same crime despite having the upper hand of a fit first-choice center back duo for much of the season.\nTottenham (2025-26)Tottenham  (2024-25) Brentford (2024-25)Points per game1.11.01.5Goals per game1.41.71.7Expected goals per game1.11.61.6Goals against per game1.41.71.4Expected goals against per game1.51.71.5Spurs' defensive shortcomings were hard to ignore even in a superficial watch on any given matchday. The defenders at his disposal had years of experience alongside one another and yet appeared completely disjointed, the natural result of Frank failing to lock in tactical foundations and going back to the drawing board more often than a coach of his caliber usually does. His defenders seemed unsure of their next move, unable to rely upon their instincts and mistake-prone as a result. Frustration and despair oozed out of the players each time a goal was conceded, no matter how predictable it was; contempt grew amongst the fanbase, who were more prone to booing than cheering quickly enough in Frank's tenure.Frank's Spurs underperformed in equal measure in front of goal. The coach had the bare bones of an attacking idea from the start of the season, one that seemed to go hand-in-hand with Spurs' odd squad construction. He would bypass midfield for the most part and instead prioritize play on the wings to generate attacking opportunities, a solution of sorts for a team that lacked any real passers after James Maddison tore his ACL in preseason, all while nicking a few goals off of set pieces. That plan did not pan out all that much – Spurs' attacking statistics this season are buoyed by an early season blitz in which they outperformed their expected goals tally, a run of beginner's luck that is generally hard to sustain.In no time at all, Spurs were out of ideas. Completing simple attacking plays was a difficult task, while their game was never built around earning more set pieces even though it was the rare area of the game they actually excelled in. At times, Frank sucked the life out of games instead, hoping his disinterest in scoring goals would grind opponents' attacks into dust. The coach gave an overly conservative approach the runout a handful of times last fall in matches that could have served as statement-making performances and at this point, it should come as no surprise that it did not work. Spurs tallied three shots and 0.12 xG in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea in which the Blues were unlucky not to have scored more as they racked up 15 attempts and 3.68 xG. Days later, Arsenal made sure not to waste their chances – they cruised to a 4-1 win as they tallied 17 shots and 1.93 xG, all while Spurs had three shots and 0.07 xG to speak of. It was evidently worse than Postecoglou's figures, but even Frank's own in his final season at Brentford.The inability to defend and attack properly was visible even at the end of Frank's tenure, perfectly encapsulated in the final goal Spurs conceded before his firing. His side could not complete a simple breakaway minutes after notching an equalizer against Newcastle, instead letting Anthony Gordon dance around a still Spurs defense before Jacob Ramsey popped the ball into the back fo the net.\nFrank's Spurs were lifeless, a whiplash-inducing exercise for anyone who remembers watching Postecoglou's version of the team. It was strange to watch Frank's Spurs give attacking a try for 45 minutes at a time every third or fourth game and then settle into a defensive structure that they could not maintain, inviting opponents into the match rather than killing the game entirely. Almost singlehandedly, he demonstrated that the belief that pragmatism is inherently efficient is a trope rather than a tried and tested philosophy for success in this sport. There is nothing practical about taking the foot off the gas when things are trending in the right direction. It is not effective to keep taking a stab at a losing strategy, hoping it will finally turn good. It is painfully unrealistic not to find a way to lean on your strengths, even if they are few and far between. There is nothing sensible about failing to lay down tactical foundations, rendering your team unable to execute a stylistic vision that seems like a prerequisite to being an elite coach.With Frank at the helm, Spurs merely dragged their feet through matches as if they were simply there to collect an attendance award rather than play. No one wins trophies with style points but Frank proved one can certainly lose without them, his team always hitting the pitch with a sense of aimlessness. It is no wonder, then, that he drew the ire of the Spurs faithful, who, unlike his team in attack, wasted no chance to lambast him for spearheading a \"boring, boring Tottenham\" – in every sense, he sucked the entertainment value and the inherent joy out of the game. In a landscape where the sport's next great managers increasingly prefer tactical rigidity, Frank's Spurs will act as a prime example in the downside of straying too far down that path. Being cautious does not inherently come with rewards, nor does it necessarily come with stability and in this case, it can slowly contribute to the erosion of an already decaying product. It forces existential questions, too, of what exactly the point of this particular exercise was for a team in desperate need of a course correction.Spurs' squad may not be up to the task of finishing even remotely close to a UEFA Champions League spot, but neither is Frank. In an age where clubs are quick to dispose of managers, he was given a chance but threw it away completely, the glimmer of hope that came in the UEFA Super Cup outing against Paris Saint-Germain an outlier rather than the start of a promising trend. Frank's firing will require a serious rethink by Spurs' leaders, many of whom are brand new to their roles after longtime chairman Daniel Levy's exit in September, because their current woes are the result of years of mismanagement and remarkably poor squad building, their trip to the Champions League final seven years ago now a distant memory of a long-gone era.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The speed part of speedskating isn't the easiest thing to translate to a TV screen.When men and women race in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints at the Summer Olympics, their raw athletic prowess is obvious. It pops through a broadcast. Legs pumping and arms churning, eight racers dart their hearts out mere feet from one another as a sea of humanity of tens of thousands strong shrieks from their guts. It's obvious and irresistible theater, and the speed (thanks to advanced technology and cameras that move alongside the sprinters) is tangible even while watching from the comfort of your couch. Speedskating — sprinting's Winter Olympics analog — doesn't carry that widespread appeal every four years, when it gets a February main-stage moment. The skaters look fast, but how fast are they really going? It can be hard to discern. And they're on skates, after all, so the training and endurance that it takes to be an Olympic-level competitor is somewhat muted because they're zipping around on ice. Beyond that, racers don unitards with hoods over their heads (for aerodynamics) and wear protective goggles, too.\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFair or not, it's hard for speedskating to cultivate most of its best into highly marketable athletes who can truly break into the mainstream.\nJordan Stolz might be too great to be held back, though. Niche sport be damned, the United States looks like it has its next Olympic superstar. The 21-year-old from Wisconsin made his 2026 Olympic debut on Wednesday in Milan and exceeded the considerable hype that trailed in his wake going into these Games. Stolz took gold in the 1,000-meter race, and as if that wasn't enough, he did it in both come-from-behind fashion and record-setting style. Stolz's superhuman strength is how he doesn't wear down as races go on. As other elite speedskaters see their times unavoidably weighted by critical seconds the deeper they get into their races, Stolz's endurance is a phenomenal separator.Watch how he used his abilities to take gold on Wednesday.\nStolz's 1:06.28 blitz was .50 seconds ahead of his chief rival, Jenning de Boo from the Netherlands. \nLike so many speed contests in the Olympics, the difference in first vs. second or second vs. third can be one, two or three-hundredths of a second. Stolz's time was a laughable half-second faster than de Boo's, marking the largest gap between a gold and silver Olympics finish in the 1,000 since 1984. Stolz also broke the previous Olympic record by almost a full second. He didn't set the world record on Wednesday, though. And that's OK. He already has that, too. He set it at the world championships in January 2024. Get ready, because Wednesday was the start of what could be an all-time Olympic career for a guy who grew up with a huge pond in his backyard, would practice deep into the frigid, black winter nights and is already turning his origin story into a quintessential Olympic fairytale.\nIf you missed Stolz's race in real time on Wednesday, that's understandable. It was in the middle of the afternoon in the middle of the work week. NBC will re-air it on Wednesday night. Make the time to watch, because this is your official announcement to get on the Stolz train. He's got one gold and is going for four. Still to come for Stolz: the 500-meter, 1,500-meter and the must-see chaos race that is the mass start. He may well leave Milan with four medals around his neck, and they could all be first-place finishes. \nHe's practically already at the Michael Phelps, Katie Ledecky level already where it would be stunning to see him finish in any place other than the top podium position. That's because Stolz claimed first in the world championships in 2023 and 2024 in the 500, 1,000 and 1,500 meters. Everyone on the ice fears him. And he is unquestionably the biggest breakout star of these Winter Olympics. The sport has had some legends over the decades, to be sure. Eric Heiden changed American speedskating forever when he won five golds at the 1980 Olympic Games in Lake Placid. Bonnie Blair, Apolo Ohno and Shani Davis reached the pinnacle in the ensuing decades. Stolz is next, and is poised to perhaps be the greatest to ever do it. He gets his next chance at a legacy-defining Olympics with the men's 500-meter race on Saturday.\n            ",

In that post, Vonn said her injury -- a complex tibia fracture -- would require multiple surgeries to repair, and on Wednesday she offered another update following her third surgery with a photo from her hospital bed in Italy. \n\nI had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I'm making progress and while it is slow, I know I'll be ok. Thankful for all of the incredible medical staff, friends, family, who have been by my side and the beautiful outpouring of love and support from people around the world. Also, huge congrats to my teammates and all of the Team USA athletes who are out there inspiring me and giving me something to cheer for. ❤️🤍💙In the photo, the extent of the injury is evident in the amount of bracing on Vonn's leg. However, even in the face of what seems likely to be a career-ending injury, Vonn continues to express gratitude and appreciation for fans supporting her journey back to competition. \nVonn's return to the Olympics saw her return to the top of the downhill standings this season, but a crash in Switzerland a week before the games threatened to derail her comeback after she suffered a torn ACL in her left knee. Vonn was able to get cleared by doctors to continue competing, and after successfully completing her training runs, she was still a podium contender heading into Sunday's downhill. \n        \n            \n                Lindsey Vonn has 'no regrets' after Olympics crash as skiing figures defend her decision to race on torn ACL\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarly in her run, Vonn clipped a gate as she came over a jump that caused her to get off balance and led to the crash that made for a cruel ending to an inspiring comeback bid. As she explained in her first post, she was just five inches too far inside on her line, pushing herself to the limit as always trying to get every edge possible. \nThat willingness to push boundaries made Vonn a legend, and her resilience in the face of injuries and heartache continues to make her a beloved figure in American sport. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Islam Makhachev is ready to fight fellow UFC champion Ilia Topuria at the White House.Makhachev vs. Topuria is arguably the best fight the UFC could make, pitting CBS Sports' No. 1 and No. 2 pound-for-pound fighters against each other. Recently, Makhachev expressed interest in fighting Topuria, likely at welterweight, where Makhachev reigns as champion.\"I like this idea,\" Makhachev told Serbian outlet Telegraf about the Topuria fight. \"If  the UFC wants [this fight], I know a lot of MMA fans want this fight,  I'm ready.\" Makhachev expressed interest in fighting at the upcoming UFC event at the White House, which UFC president and CEO Dana White recently told CBS Sports will be \"the most watched UFC event ever.\" The card is scheduled for June 14, coinciding with President Donald Trump's 80th birthday. It gives Makhachev ample time to resume training after fasting for Ramadan.\n\"We have the Ramadan month, I'm not  going to train for one month,\" Makhachev said. \"After that, I will slowly begin my  training camp, and I will be ready. White House [or] other dates, I will  be ready.\" Topuria has been calling out Makhachev for some time. Topuria vacated the featherweight title last year to fight for the lightweight title. However, Makhachev had already relinquished the 155-pound belt to prepare for a welterweight campaign. Makhachev previously expressed no interest in returning to lightweight, preferring to rack up title defenses at 170 pounds.\"In my division, a lot of contenders who deserve the title fight,\"   Makhachev said. \"UFC just has to give me a new target. That's it. I'm   just waiting.\" \nTopuria must likely bulk up to an additional weight class to challenge his fellow two-division champion. He's expressed a willingness to do so if it meant fighting Makhachev, though \"El Matador\" has business at lightweight, too. Topuria resumed training last week after reportedly settling a legal dispute with his ex-wife. During Topuria's absence, Justin Gaethje defeated Paddy Pimblett to win the interim lightweight title at UFC 324. Topuria and Gaethje are expected to unify their titles at a later date.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the NBA season past the halfway point, fantasy managers can no longer afford to wait for roles to sort themselves out. Trades, injuries and shifting team priorities have already reshaped rotations across the league, creating new opportunities for players stepping into expanded workloads. Identifying these changes before they fully register in box scores is often the difference between a playoff berth and an early exit. From young guards like Jaden Ivey and Nolan Traore to veterans such as Brook Lopez, here are several players whose evolving situations make them strong candidates to deliver meaningful fantasy value down the stretch.Jaden Ivey, BullsIvey began the season sidelined with injury trouble but managed to work his way into serviceable form through the last couple of months while he played out of a bench role for the Pistons. However, after being traded to the Bulls in early February, he has started in three straight games, averaging 12.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.7 steals over that span. He should continue to see notable playing time with his new squad and will likely continue to deliver good value as he builds up a rhythm. GG Jackson, GrizzliesSince the departure of Jaren Jackson via trade, GG has benefited by taking on a starting role and a boost in playing time. He is averaging 12.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks in 26.8 minutes per game over four straight starts. He is also shooting an impressive 53.3 percent from the field over that span, with 2.0 three-pointers made per outing. He should continue to handle an expanded role and is likely to increase, or at least maintain, his production as he gets more comfortable. While this is his third NBA season, he has not had too many consistent opportunities but has shown promise when offered the chance. Nique Clifford, KingsClifford has started in six of the last nine games, including the two most recent outings, as he is stepping up while his squad deals with injury trouble. Additionally, the fact that the Kings sit last place in the West with nearly zero chance of making a run at the playoffs suggests that the squad will continue to lean towards allowing more opportunity for their rookie to explore his game. Clifford is averaging 12.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.1 steals, with 1.8 made three-pointers per game over the aforementioned nine-game span. He also dropped a season-high 30 points in the game before last. \nNolan Traore, NetsTraore has started the last seven games and is averaging 11.0 points, 2.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists, while shooting 48.4 percent from the field in 27.4 minutes per game over that span. With his squad sitting well out of a play-in spot and showing a clear focus on development, it is likely that the 19-year-old continues to see a substantial amount of playing time the rest of the way. He produced his first career double-double in his most recent outing and topped the 20-point mark twice in his last eight appearances. Gui Santos, WarriorsSantos has started in four straight and six of the last nine games, averaging 13.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.9 blocks, while shooting a blistering 60.3 percent from the field over that span. Jimmy Butler going down with an injury for the rest of the season is a primary factor in there being more playing time to go around within the Warriors' lineup. So far, Santos has done a great job in identifying himself as a prime candidate to handle a bigger role down the stretch of the season.  Brook Lopez, ClippersIt is surprising to find an 18-year vet on this list, but Lopez is back in the driver's seat at the center position, as his new squad traded away their star center, Ivica Zubac. Despite his relatively advanced age, Lopez has shown that he is still up to the task of filling a key role, as he is averaging 8.0 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.5 blocks over four consecutive starts, while shooting 41.7 percent from long range over that span. His three-point shooting and shot-blocking have been the driving factors in his success for many years now. As long as he can continue to maintain production in those areas, he will likely hang on to the starting job. \nMoussa Diabate, HornetsDiabate began the season in a bench role but earned himself a promotion through his persistent hustle. He has started in 22 consecutive appearances, averaging 8.8 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 blocks over that span and is in line to remain the go-to option at center for his up-and-coming squad. It is noteworthy that he is facing a multi-game suspension for his part in an on-court scuffle in the Hornets' last game, but he will be back in action by February 24, and should pick up where he left off. Dylan Cardwell, KingsCardwell did a fantastic job in proving himself as a strong contributor while Domantas Sabonis was sidelined with injury trouble. Since then, Cardwell has continued to provide strong production off the bench and is averaging 6.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.8 blocks over the last 10 games. He is also up to three double-doubles on the season. The first-year big man should see plenty of opportunity the rest of the way and is more than likely to continue to thrive as a rebounder and shot-blocker. Jalen Smith, BullsSmith is in line for a significant boost after the Bulls parted ways with Nikola Vucevic. Unfortunately, he has missed four of the last six games due to injury trouble, but he has started in eight of his last nine appearances, averaging 13.2 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 0.8 steals per game over that span. Smith has shown flashes of great potential over the last couple of years but has not had the opportunity to fully spread his wings. However, it is likely that he gets that chance through the rest of this season, once returns to action. \nScoot Henderson, Trail BlazersHenderson made his season debut on February 6, and delivered 11 points, five rebounds, nine assists and one steal in just 21 minutes of action. He sat out the next game but followed up with 12 points, two rebounds, seven assists and a steal in the Trail Blazers' most recent outing. The third-year guard still has a way to go in order to meet the expectations of a top-three draft pick but early indications show that he is ready to provide a notable impact for his squad as they battle to maintain a shot at the playoffs this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Of the 34 starting quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl, Sam Darnold's story is one of the most unique. The No. 3 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold toiled on bad New York Jets teams before having a brief reprieve with the Carolina Panthers and then blossoming into a Pro Bowler with the Minnesota Vikings. After late-season struggles, the Vikings deemed Darnold expendable, though, which led to him signing a multi-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks, whose faith in Darnold was quickly rewarded with another Pro Bowl season that culminated in the franchise's second Super Bowl win. Seattle celebrated that victory on Wednesday, and Darnold was quick to show his appreciation for the team that brought him in as a free agent.\"I've talked a lot this last week about belief,\" Darnold told the crowd during Wednesday's victory parade. \"A lot of people didn't believe in me, but it didn't matter because the ones that are close believed in me, including you all. I appreciate you all so much. That short list also includes [team owner] Jody Allen, [general manager] John Schneider, [coach] Mike Macdonald. I appreciate the belief you all had in me for signing me this past year.\n\"And last but certainly not least, these players, man, for believing in me. I wouldn't be here without these guys.\"\nThroughout the season, Darnold received public support from his teammates that included some fiery comments in Week 11 from linebacker Ernest Jones IV. Jones went out of his way to praise Darnold when it was his time to address the crowd on Wednesday.\"Not only do we have the best defense in the world, we've got the best team in the world,\" he said. \"And quite frankly, if you've got anything to say about my quarterback, if you've got anything to say about my defense, if you've got anything to say about our o-line, if you've got anything to say about the city of Seattle, I've got two words for you: f--- you!\"\nWhile he played on a strong team with an elite defense, Darnold played a significant role in Seattle's success this season. He out-dueled league MVP Matthew Stafford during Seattle's come-from-behind win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 16 and did so again in the NFC title game. In the Super Bowl, Darnold more than held his own against a New England Patriots defense that was constantly jumping routes and blanketing his receivers. On the game's first drive, Darnold completed several tough passes that helped set up the first of Jason Myers' Super Bowl record five field goals. Darnold and Patriots counterpart Drake Maye had their struggles, but Darnold's play started to elevate as Kenneth Walker III piled up yards on the ground. With New England's defense focused on Walker, Darnold took advantage and helped the Seahawks put together six scoring drives. His 16-yard touchdown pass to AJ Barner that made it a 19-0 game early in the fourth quarter. \nAnd with a strong core intact, the Seahawks believe they can compete for years to come. \"We're not done,\" defensive end Leonard Williams said. \"We're coming back next year.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just when you think the NWSL preseason is settling ahead of the new calendar year, the big moves keep coming. Kansas City Current have acquired midfielder Croix Bethune from Washington Spirit, sources tell CBS Sports. Washington Spirit are set to receive a record-matching fee for Bethune. The deal is finalized though not set to be announced until a later date.North Carolina Courage currently holds the record for intraleague funds ($1.25 million) after trading Jaedyn Shaw to Gotham FC last year. Bethune is coming off a successful two-year stint with the Washington Spirit, where she won the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year. In her first pro season, she tied Tobin Heath's decade-old single-season assist record in just 17 games thanks to a season-ending torn meniscus. She also won the league's inaugural NWSL Midfielder of the Year award. Her impressive rookie season earned her a place on the 2024 Olympic gold medal-winning U.S. women's national team, and she's recorded seven caps so far.Sources also confirmed that the player requested the trade, and her former club worked to complete the deal. Bethune received interest from other teams, though now she'll be joining the league's reigning NWSL Shield winners. \nShe often showcases her vision with short, elegant passes and is a certified playmaker. Her move to Kansas City is a welcome arrival following the departure of recent playmaker and goal scorer Bia Zaneratto. The Brazilian international left the club after her contract expired and returned to Palmeiras in free agency.Bethune's rise to prominence was anything but easy. The player has had to bounce back from a torn meniscus that cut her NWSL rookie season short. In college, the player tore her ACL twice, but was drafted into the NWSL after earning two-time first-team All-American and Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year honors with a career that saw her start at Southern California and finish at Georgia. She's shown she can bounce back and contribute and now joins Kansas City after her recent camps with the U.S. women's national team and a short preseason stint with the Spirit. \nWashington Spirit make it officialFollowing CBS Sports' reporting that Bethune's movement came by way of request, the Spirit announced Bethune's departure on Wednesday. Bethune's move to Kansas City yielded a club-record $100k in allocation funds and $900k in transfer threshold funds, the third-largest return in NWSL history. \"We are grateful to Croix for her contributions over the past two seasons. After conversations about her desire to explore development opportunities in a different environment, we were able to structure a deal that honored her request while securing significant value for our club, making it the third-highest intra-league transfer in NWSL history and a top ten mark globally,\" said club president of soccer operations Haley Carter. \"We evaluate every situation on its individual merits, and in this case, the alignment of player goals and organizational value made sense for all parties. That said, our focus is on the talented core we have returning. We're heading into 2026 healthy, deep, and ready to win.\"\nClaire Hutton moves on from Kansas City CurrentKansas City Current also traded midfielder Claire Hutton to Bay FC on Wednesday. The Midwest club received $1.1 million in intraleague transfer funds for the 2025 NWSL Best XI honoree, who is also a member of the USWNT. \"Claire is an important signing for us. She's a top-quality player who is tight on the ball, and she has the mobility and physical presence to break up play,\" said Bay FC head coach Emma Coates.\"Despite her age she brings experience and a strong mentality, and we believe she has the potential to become one of the best midfielders in the world. The most exciting part for us is her desire to keep getting better, and we're excited to support her through the next stages of her career and even more excited to see the impact she will have at Bay FC.\" \nThe 20-year-old Hutton was a 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year finalist and leaves Kansas City Current as a rising star in the NWSL and U.S. women's national team. Hutton signed her first professional contract in 2024 at 17 years old with Kansas City, the sixth player signed under the league's Under-18 Entry Mechanism, and she has since become a regular club starter with a bright future for her new club and her country.She has 13 appearances for the USWNT since her debut in 2025, and recently, head coach Emma Hayes discussed a leadership role with the midfielder, who is the youngest player to captain the national team in the Hayes era. When could they make official debuts?The Kansas City Current open up their season hosting the Utah Royals at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday, March 14, while Bay FC host expansion side Denver Summit the same day with kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET.\n            ",

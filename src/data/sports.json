    "body": "\n        MACtion has been a fixture in college football since 1999, and there are two Mid-American Conference matchups to kick off the Week 11 college football schedule on Tuesday. Both games begin at 7 p.m. ET, as Akron hosts UMass in one matchup, while Ohio hosts Miami (OH) for an in-state rivalry in the other. According to the latest Week 11 college football odds, Akron is favored by 9.5 points at home, while Ohio is favored by 2.5 at home. The total has gone Over in four of the last five meetings between Ohio and Miami (OH), and the over/under for total points scored on Tuesday is 49.5.Our computer model's top picks two for Tuesday are Under 49.5 points in Ohio vs. Miami (OH) and UMass money line (+301) in Akron vs. UMass.

Ohio won 38-3 on the road last year, and this game has failed to reach 50 points in two of the last three seasons.

The Minutemen are winless this season but did win their last matchup with the Zips in 2019, and a national television audience might be enough to inspire the program.

    "body": "\n        The Arizona Cardinals will turn to Jacoby Brissett at quarterback this Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, as Kyler Murray continues to recover from a foot injury suffered in Week 5, coach Jonathan Gannon said Tuesday. Brissett has started the last three games, leading the team to a 27-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys Monday night, completing 67.7% of his passes for 261 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for another score.The Cardinals now have Brissett leading the offense on a short week as they travel to Seattle to face a 6-2 Seahawks team coming off a blowout road win over the Washington Commanders. Murray could be out longer than originally anticipated. Multiple doctors have advised that Murray's foot injury could require 4-8 weeks to fully heal, according to ESPN. \"He's doing well,\" Gannon said of Murray. \"He wants to be out there. He's a competitor. I talked to him today. He's a good teammate and he's working to get healthy.\"\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline winners and losers: Jets smartly stockpile for overhaul; Colts, Cowboys overpay?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMurray hasn't played since Oct. 5. He was limited in practice last week before the team announced on Saturday that Brissett would start. Gannon said last week that Murray could have a role in the Dallas game, but he was later ruled inactive.\nBrissett has performed well in Murray's absence, throwing for 320 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in a narrow Week 6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, followed by a 279-yard, two-touchdown effort in Week 7 against the Green Bay Packers.Brissett became the second player in Cardinals franchise history to pass for 250 yards, two touchdowns and rush for a touchdown on \"Monday Night Football,\" joining Jim Hart in 1974, according to CBS Sports Research. He has played well enough to spark a quarterback controversy.Following the win in Dallas, reporters asked Gannon if Murray was still his starting quarterback when he returns. \n\"Yeah, nothing's changed on that,\" Gannon said. \"That's how I feel.\" Reporters followed up by questioning if Brissett did well enough to earn deeper opportunity.\"I got nothing to add on that, guys,\" Gannon said.For now, the team will move forward with Brissett, the journeyman backup whose stats compare favorably to Murray, the No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft.Comparing Jacoby Brissett, Kyler MurrayKyler MurrayJacoby BrissettYards per attempt6.07.7Total TDs77Turnovers42Passer rating88.6102.5The Cardinals' weaponry has benefitted from the change under center.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL trade deadline has come and gone, and we saw several big names that were moved. The New York Jets sent cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys, while Las Vegas Raiders wideout Jakobi Meyers is on his way to the Jacksonville Jaguars. One big name that was not moved, however, was Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown. While the Eagles were active in acquiring players such as pass rusher Jaelan Phillips and cornerbacks Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander, there was speculation Brown could be traded given the fact he was apparently unhappy with his role in Philly's offense earlier in the year. But all the noise was just that: noise. During a Tuesday press conference, Eagles general manager Howie Roseman was asked about Brown, and if he entertained any offers for the star pass-catcher. Roseman said teams pursuing the Lombardi Trophy don't move on from talented players like Brown.\n\"I think that when you're trying to be a great team, it's hard to trade great players, and A.J. Brown's a great player. He wears the 'C' for a reason. He's an important part of this team, of this organization. He cares about winning, he cares about his teammates, and I think that when you're a team like ours that is looking forward to an opportunity to compete for a championship, you just don't get rid of guys like that. We feel very lucky to have him on our team and excited about the second half of the season with him.\"The Eagles were on a bye last week, and Brown actually missed the Week 8 victory against the New York Giants due to a hamstring injury, but Philly's passing game has gotten back on track in recent weeks. In the Week 7 victory against the Minnesota Vikings, Jalen Hurts posted a perfect passer rating while Brown caught four passes for a season-high 121 yards and two touchdowns. It was Brown's first multi-touchdown game since 2023. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline winners and losers: Jets smartly stockpile for overhaul; Colts, Cowboys overpay?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown and DeVonta Smith combined for 304 yards and three touchdowns vs. the Vikings, the second-most receiving yards they have combined for in their four seasons teammates. The duo averaged 99.2 receiving yards per game in the first six weeks of the season, but this passing attack may have turned over a new leaf. \nTo Roseman's point, contenders do not part ways with elite talent -- and Brown is an elite talent. There were certainly questions about this offense earlier in the season, but at 6-2, the Eagles look poised to repeat as top dogs in the NFC East and defend their title as Super Bowl champion.\n            ",

No. 6 Duke and Texas will meet in the Dick Vitale Invitational 2025, which is an event in its inaugural year. Duke went 35-4 last season, sweeping both the ACC regular season and tournament, before bowing out in the Final Four. Texas went 19-16 a year ago and lost in the First Four of March Madness, before replacing Rodney Terry with Sean Miller as head coach.Tipoff is at 8:45 p.m. ET from the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C. Duke has won all three prior matchups between the programs. The Blue Devils are 10.5-point favorites in the latest Duke vs. Texas odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 153.5.

Lassina Traore transfers in from Long Beach State, where he was a two-time All-Big West Selection and twice led the conference in rebounds. Also, the Longhorns landed Matas Vokietaitis from FAU, where the Lithuanian was the American Conference Rookie of the Year last season, averaging 10.2 points, 5.4 rebounds and knocking down 67.7% of his field goal attempts.Perhaps the biggest addition for Texas is bringing aboard coach Sean Miller, who previously served at Xavier and Arizona. He is a four-time winner of his conference's Coach of the Year award and is known for getting the most out of his players, especially on the offensive end of the court. That's one area where Texas can challenge Duke as the Blue Devils lost two ACC All-Defensive players to the NBA Draft, one of them being the AP Player of the Year in Cooper Flagg. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Duke can coverDuke simply reloaded from losing Flagg and four others to the pros, as the team has the No. 1 incoming freshmen class, per 247Sports. That class is highlighted by Cameron Boozer, who is the No. 3 overall recruit and is one of four athletes, ever, to twice win the Gatorade National Player of the Year award in high school. His twin, Cayden Boozer, is the No. 4 point guard in his class, while Duke also landed two other 5-star prospects in Nikolas Khamenia and Dame Sarr.It's not only newcomers on the Duke roster as it returns four rotation players from last year's squad which made it to the Final Four. Jon Scheyer's team covered 67.7% of its games a year ago, and the Blue Devils have also covered in two-thirds of their games versus non-conference opponents since 2023. Additionally, Duke can take solace in that Texas struggled when stepping up in competition as it went 0-5 outright versus top-10 ranked teams last season. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make Duke vs. Texas picksSportsLine's model has simulated Texas vs. Duke  10,000 times and is leaning Over the total, projecting 153 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The New Orleans Pelicans expected to take a step forward in the 2025-26 season, as evidenced by trading their unprotected 2026 draft pick to the Atlants Hawks so they could select Derik Queen with the No. 10 pick in June. Two weeks into the season, nothing has gone according to plan for the Pelicans, who are one of the last two winless teams in the NBA at 0-6. Adding to the dreadful vibes of a winless start is Tuesday's news that Zion Williamson will miss at least 7-10 days with a Grade 1 hamstring strain. Given Williamson's injury history, there's plenty of concern that a hamstring strain could linger or get aggravated again later, creating additional stress for Pelicans fans. New Orleans' 0-6 start has featured three losses by 30-plus points, resulting in the league's worst net rating at a staggering -18.3. That performance has led to rumblings that coach Willie Green has lost the locker room and his seat gets hotter with each loss. Losing Williamson -- the team's leader in points, rebounds, assists and blocks per game -- won't add much optimism that they'll suddenly turn things around. \n\n        \n            \n                NBA Hater Report: Pelicans are a disaster, Ja Morant can't shoot, why Warriors struggle without Draymond\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhy Zion Williamson is so important to PelicansWilliamson is the most important player on a New Orleans roster that has plenty of issues, namely a frontcourt that was already thin on size and heavily reliant on Wililamson. Kevon Looney made his debut in a blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, providing some help for Yves Missi and Queen, but both of the Pelicans' young centers are light on size (especially Queen). Given their lack of bulk in the paint, it comes as little surprise New Orleans has been one of the league's worst rebounding teams and ranks last in defensive rating. Without Williamson, Green will likely have to see what Queen can do in extended minutes. The rookie has only played 17.5 minutes per game in the first six contests off the bench, but his ability to score is something none of their other frontcourt options provide. Elsewhere, the Pelicans will need Trey Murphy III to shake out of his early slump to play like a star-level talent and Jordan Poole figures to take on an even bigger role in the offense. \nHow long could Pelicans' winless streak last?None of that provides an awful lot of encouragement and with Williamson missing at least the next four games, if not more, it's fair to wonder when the Pelicans' first win will arrive. Tuesday night figures to be their best chance against a Charlotte Hornets team that will be without LaMelo Ball (ankle) and Brandon Miller (shoulder). But with Williamson now absent, New Orleans is only a short favorite (-2.5 at FanDuel). If they don't win against the Hornets, a three-game road trip awaits before Zion could potentially return. 11/4: vs. Hornets 11/5: at Dallas Mavericks11/8: at San Antonio Spurs11/10: at Phoenix Suns11/12: vs. Portland Trail BlazersIf they cannot win one of those five games, with Dallas, Phoenix and Portland all looking beatable in the early going this season, then the Pelicans' losing streak could stretch on for a very long time even once Williamson returns. The rest of their November schedule is pretty brutal and filled with West contenders. Their most winnable games the rest of the month will be against Atlanta, Dallas (again) and the Memphis Grizzlies. \nIf they somehow can't get any of those games, Dec. 6 against the league's other winless squad, the Brooklyn Nets, could be a titanic battle of basketball inferiority. The key difference being the Nets are actively tanking after trading to get their draft picks back, while the Pelicans are trying their hardest to win because they have no incentive to lose with their pick belonging to the Hawks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Royals are keeping their captain around another two years. The Royals have signed catcher Salvador Perez to a two-year contract extension through the 2027 season, the team announced Tuesday. The deal is worth $25 million and includes some deferrals, per MLB.com. The extension replaces Perez's $13.5 million club option for 2026. \"Salvy  is a Royals legend and one of the most important players this franchise  has ever had,\" GM J.J. Picollo said in a statement.  \"We had the option for next year, but everyone knew we wanted  to make sure his legacy with us continued longer than that. We  appreciate Salvy's commitment to the Royals, and we're just as excited  as our fans.\" \nNow 35, had another productive season in 2025, slashing .236/.284/.446 with 30 home runs in 641 plate appearances. The on-base percentage is an eyesore, though Perez has never been a big on-base player, and the overall production is very good for someone who spends most of his time behind the plate. His catcher defense is passable more than an asset at this point. Perez should pass Hall of Famer George Brett for the most home runs in Royals history sometime in 2026. He has 303 and Brett retired with 317. No other Royal has hit even 200 homers. Also, Perez could become only the third player in team history to appear in 2,000 games. He's at 1,707 games. Only Brett (2,707) and Frank White (2,324) on the franchise leaderboard.\nThe two-year extension ensures the Royals will keep Perez alongside Bobby Witt Jr., All-Star third baseman Maikel Garcia, and ace Cole Ragans through 2027, which will be prime contention years for a Kansas City team that went to the postseason in 2024. The AL Central is winnable and it would more difficult to win the division without Perez than with him. That all said, Perez's new contract does great some questions about his future defensive home, and also the team's bevy of catcher prospects. Here are a few things Kansas City must now sort out with Perez locked up through 2027.  Where will Perez play? Since 2000, only seven players have caught 170 games during their age 36-37 seasons, and only one has done it since 2009: A.J. Pierzynski (195 games from 2013-14). Even with the one-knee catching stance reducing wear and tear, catcher is usually a young player's position. It is no surprise then that the Royals have cut back on Perez's catching workload the last few years. \nHere is the breakdown of Perez's starts by position since the shortened pandemic season in 2020:  CatcherFirst baseDH2021 \t\t\t\t75% \t\t\t\t0 \t\t\t\t25% \t\t\t\t2022 \t\t\t\t65% \t\t\t\t0 \t\t\t\t35% \t\t\t\t2023 \t\t\t\t64% \t\t\t\t15% \t\t\t\t21% \t\t\t\t2024 \t\t\t\t57% \t\t\t\t28% \t\t\t\t15% \t\t\t\t2025 \t\t\t\t57% \t\t\t\t18% \t\t\t\t25% \t\t\t\tThe trend is clear. Fewer starts at catcher, more at first base and DH. Expect that to continue these next two years, perhaps to the point where Perez starts fewer than half his games behind the plate come 2027. Less time at catcher will put a bit more pressure on Perez's bat, though his power plays at any position, plus he brings off-the-charts intangibles and leadership. Something along the lines of 50% starts at catcher with 25% at first base and 25% at DH seems reasonable enough. That would still give Vinnie Pasquantino most of the playing time at first base. Perez will still catch a lot. That much is clear. He's just unlikely to carry the enormous workloads he had earlier in his career. It's time to scale back in an effort to keep him healthy and productive. What about those catcher prospects? One of them, Carter Jensen, made his MLB debut in September and impressed, hitting .300/.391/.550 with three home runs in 20 games. In those 20 games Carter split his workload evenly: 10 games at catcher and 10 at DH. The 22-year-old is Kansas City's top prospect, per MLB Pipeline, and a big part of their future. He and Perez will again share catcher/DH time in 2026. Jensen is not the Royals' only touted catcher prospect, however. Blake Mitchell, their 2023 first-round pick, is a consensus top 100 prospect. Ramon Ramirez is regarded as one of their 10 best prospects as well. He's also a catcher. The Royals have Perez under contract through 2027 plus three well-regarded catcher prospects in the system. How do they handle this? For starters, this is not something the Royals have to figure out right now. Jensen and Perez can coexist on the MLB roster and neither Mitchell nor Ramirez have played a game above Single-A. They're still at least one year away from the big leagues, likely more given the steep development curve for catchers. Perez and Mitchell/Ramirez may never be on the same MLB roster! Also, catchers are always valuable trade chips. If the Royals decide Jensen is their guy long-term, they can use Mitchell and/or Ramirez to get help elsewhere on the roster (outfield, hint hint). Mitchell, Ramirez, and even Jensen are hardly proven commodities. If the Royals find themselves with too many good catchers in a year or two, they should celebrate, not worry. The Royals went 82-80 in 2025 but were better in the second half (35-30) than the first (47-50). With better health and a few new outfielders, Kansas City can return to the postseason in 2026. The hardest part of the building the roster is done. They have their foundation in Garcia, Pasquantino, Perez, Ragans, and Witt. Now they just have to upgrade the supporting cast. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fighter Isaac Dulgarian created quite the firestorm of controversy this past weekend in the UFC. The fighter, who lost by first-round submission to Yadier del Valle, had suspicious betting activity linked to his bout where he entered as a sizable favorite before the number dropped significantly. UFC president Dana White said on Tuesday that the FBI is looking into everything that happened at the UFC Apex on Saturday night.Dulgarian was listed by sportsbooks as a solid favorite at roughly -250 to defeat del Valle as of Saturday morning. As the fight drew near, Dulgarian's moneyline dropped all the way to anywhere from nearly -170 to -130. That kind of severe line movement in such a short time indicates large amounts of money coming in, and is highly unusual.IC360 notified its clients, including UFC, on Saturday to a suspicious amount of wagers on del Valle to win in the first round, according to ESPN.Dulgarian shot for a single takedown attempt at the start of the fight and did little else before he was submitted by rear-naked choke at the 3:41 mark of the first round, cashing the aforementioned wagers on underdog del Valle to win in the first round.\nAfter the fight, some sportsbooks informed customers that they would receive credit for wagers placed on Dulgarian.\nAfter releasing Dulgarian, the UFC released a statement regarding IC360's investigation.\"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events,\" the statement read. \"Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"\nUFC CEO Dana White spoke to TMZ and clarified when the promotion was notified of the suspicious betting activity, and the promotion's response when the fight played out as it did.\"Probably about 1 p.m. that day ... we're with a company called IC360, and they are the best bet monitoring company in the business ... they reached out to us and told us that there was some unusual action going on with that fight and did we know anything,\" White said. \"We didn't. So what we did was, we called the fighter and his lawyer and said, 'What's going on? There's some weird betting action going on in your fight. Are you injured? Do you owe anybody money? Has anybody approached you?' And the kid said, 'No, absolutely not. I'm going to kill this guy.'\"So we said, 'OK,' the fight plays out and it's a first-round finish by rear-naked choke. Literally the first thing we did was call the FBI. We called the FBI, I met with the FBI twice today, so, that's the whole thing.\"\nSince the fight, rumors have spread online that the FBI had started an investigation into over 100 UFC fights as a probe into fight fixing. White denied those reports.\"There are people out there talking now, 'Oh there's hundreds of fights,'\" White said. \"That's total bullshit. Total clickbait bullshit. IC360, our company, they monitor all of the betting, like I said, they're the best in the business. There aren't hundreds of fights being investigated. All clickbait BS.\"White went on to say that IC360 produces a betting report for every fight the promotion puts on.\nThis is not the first situation involving potential fight fixing in the UFC. Darrick Minner was cut by the UFC in 2022 after losing a fight that saw similar suspicious line movement. Minner and his coach, James Krause, also received suspensions from the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Tae Hyun Bang was sentenced to 10 months in prison in South Korea after accepting a bribe to throw a 2015 fight against Leo Kuntz. Bang allegedly wagered money on Kuntz to win, though Bang ultimately won the fight by split decision.White said that the investigation into Dulgarian's fight is now tied to the ongoing investigation into the 2022 situation involving Minner and Krause, saying, \"When this did happen a couple of years ago, whenever it was, that investigation is still ongoing. That will be a part of this investigation, too.\"As the controversy has taken hold on social media, several current and former UFC fighters made statements that they'd been approached about throwing fights. While most of those allegations have since been deleted, or explained away as \"jokes,\" White made it clear that those fighters can now expect a conversation with the FBI.\n\"I talked to [Director of the FBI Kash Patel] this morning,\" White said. \"We just had an office full of FBI agents in here. If you try to do this, I've been very vocal and open about this; we will be your worst enemy. We will immediately go after you guns blazin', with the FBI and whoever else we need to get, and we will do everything we can to make sure you go to prison.\"It's like, you're seeing things on the Internet where fighters are saying, 'Oh, I was approached! I was approached!' Really? Why didn't you tell us that? More importantly, why didn't you tell law enforcement you were approached? Now? Now you're saying that you were approached? ... It's really weird that fighters are coming out now saying they were approached. They're going to be approached now ... by the FBI.\"Gambling scandals involving athletes have been put under an even brighter spotlight as of late, with NBA players and coaches among those arrested in a wide-ranging FBI probe into bettors using non-public information, such as when a player would miss a game or exit it early, to place bets, as well as illegal and rigged poker games.\n            ",

Guiu almost wasn't with the team this season as he was loaned to Sunderland, but he was recalled when Nicolas Jackson was loaned to Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day in Sept. This match could be a chance for one of them to start and show Maresca why they should be in the squad regularly. Liam Delap had a strong Club World Cup, but he's still sidelined with a hamstring injury. Both George and Guiu were given limited minutes last season, but they're already pushing for more as the Blues look to get back into the Champions League places in the Premier League. Based on production, George should be slightly ahead of Guiu in who would get the start on Wednesday, but both are giving Maresca good problems.\nChelsea's search for a nine has been an agonizing one since Diego Costa was terrorizing defenses at Stamford Bridge, but the Blues may just have their strikers of the future on the roster if George and Guiu can use limited minutes to their advantage.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On Wednesday, Erling Haaland and Manchester City will host his former team, Borussia Dortmund, looking to charge up the table in the Champions League league phase. City have been susceptible away from home, losing two of their last five matches, but their home has still been a fortress. Dortmund will be a strong challenger with their attacking ability, but they'd need to break a run of six matches so far this season at home for City without a loss. Haaland has been in unreal form this season with goals in every appearance for the club but two, leading to a total of 17 goals in only 13 appearances, and in City's last four home matches, they've won by a total of 12 goals to only one. Dortmund and City have met six times in Champions League play, with Dortmund only winning one, while two matches ended in a draw, and City won three. How to watch Manchester City vs. Borussia Dortmund, oddsDate: Wednesday, Nov. 5 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Etihad Stadium -- Manchester, England Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Manchester City -230; Draw +390; Dortmund +550We're a far way off the previous inevitability that City used to carry themselves with, but winning against opposition of Dortmund's caliber will go a long way to getting back to where they want to be. Dortmund have scored four goals in three consecutive Champions League matches and can become the first team ever to score that many in four straight if they can run up the score on City.\nWhere concern comes in is that Dortmund only won two of these matches because they allowed four goals facing Juventus for that to end in a draw. Given Haaland's form, that kind of defending won't lead to a fun day away from home. But if Dortmund can figure out how to stop Haaland, that's where things could get interesting. After the Norwegian, no one on the team has scored more than two goals this season. Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku, and Rayan Cherki all have scored two goals, and then there are six players who have scored one goal. When City signed players like Omar Marmoush to improve the attack, they still haven't been able to figure out who the secondary attacker is on the squad. \nIt's been an issue since Julian Alvarez left for Atletico Madrid, and it's one that if City can't solve it soon, they won't be able to win this competition with teams like Bayern Munich getting better by the day. Haaland's form has been great and he has done a good job getting them to this point, but much more is needed before City can rise the ranks of the contenders. Facing a team that has gone deep in Champions League play multiple times in recent seasons, this will be a good chance to take a step in the right direction. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Rashid Shaheed is now a member of the Seahawks, and Jakobi Meyers is now a member of the Jaguars. Those were the two big offensive trades on Tuesday, and Fantasy managers didn't exactly get the moves we wanted.For example, Breece Hall remained with the Jets, who seemingly traded everyone else on the roster. Hall is still worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy running back for the rest of the season, but his value could have improved if he went to a team like the Chiefs.There also was the potential of Tony Pollard being dealt, and he remained with the Titans. And no tight ends were moved even though there were rumors of potential trades for David Njoku, Chigoziem Okonkwo and Michael Mayer. The Fantasy value for all of those players remains the same for the rest of the year.For Shaheed, his Fantasy value doesn't change much going from the Saints to the Seahawks, and I still consider him a No. 3 receiver in the majority of leagues. He might score more touchdowns in Seattle with a better quarterback in Sam Darnold, and Shaheed is being reunited with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak after the two were together in New Orleans in 2024.\nShaheed scored at least 11.8 PPR points in three of his past five games for the Saints, and his addition is a boost for Darnold. Shaheed shouldn't impact Jaxon Smith-Njigba as a top-tier Fantasy receiver, but this trade is crushing for promising rookie Tory Horton.I had Horton as a waiver-wire priority after he scored two touchdowns in Week 9 at Washington. Now, you should only add Horton in deeper leagues as a boom-or-bust No. 4 Fantasy option. Along with that, you can drop Cooper Kupp (hamstring) in the majority of leagues, especially since he might not play in Week 10 after sitting out in Week 9.For the Saints, Chris Olave gets a slight boost in value with Shaheed gone, and Olave should easily be the No. 1 option in the passing game for the rest of the season. He struggled in Tyler Shough's first start in Week 9 at the Rams with three catches for 57 yards on four targets, but prior to that he scored at least 14 PPR points in three games in a row.\nI also expect Juwan Johnson to benefit with Shaheed gone. Johnson had three catches for 31 yards and a touchdown on four targets against the Rams in Shough's first start, and Johnson has now scored at least 10.3 PPR points in three games in a row. He should be considered a low-end No. 1 Fantasy tight end in all leagues for the rest of the year.In deeper leagues, you can look at Devaughn Vele off the waiver wire, and hopefully he'll see an uptick in playing time with Shaheed gone. Vele only has five catches for 39 yards and a touchdown on 10 targets this season, but he should get more chances now with Shaheed in Seattle.In Jacksonville, Travis Hunter (knee) is on injured reserve and will miss at least three more games, and Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) and Dyami Brown (concussion) could be out in Week 10. The Jaguars needed help, and Meyers will hopefully be a solid short-term and long-term addition.\nHe was having a down season with the Raiders prior to the trade with 33 catches for 352 yards and no touchdowns, and he scored 9.3 PPR points or less in five games in a row. Prior to this season, Meyers had averaged at least 12.9 PPR points per game in three years in a row, including a career-best 14.5 PPR points in 2024Meyers could be available in 10-team leagues and is worth adding to see what develops. If Thomas and Brown are out in Week 10 at Houston then Meyers should be a go-to option for Trevor Lawrence, and we can adjust what happens moving forward when everyone is healthy in Jacksonville. Meyers will clearly lose value when Hunter and Thomas are on the field.But even though the Jaguars acquired Meyers, I wouldn't give up adding Parker Washington. He just had eight catches for 90 yards on nine targets at Las Vegas in Week 9, and he now has 19 targets in his past two games. Lawrence will likely continue to lean on Washington, especially if Thomas and Brown are out, and Washington can be a low-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver against the Texans.\nYou can also still stash Brenton Strange, who is eligible to return from injured reserve due to a quadriceps injury in Week 11. When healthy, Strange can be a low-end starter in the majority of leagues.In Las Vegas, Tre Tucker should benefit the most with Meyers gone. He has scored at least 11.1 PPR points in three of his past six games, and he should be the No. 1 receiver and No. 2 pass catcher for the Raiders moving forward behind only Brock Bowers. Tucker should be added in all leagues where available, and he has the potential to be a No. 3 Fantasy receiver for the rest of the year.In deeper leagues, you should take a flier on rookie Jack Bech, and hopefully he'll get an uptick in playing time with Meyers gone. Bech was selected in Round 2 of the NFL Draft, and he should be part of the youth movement for the Raiders for the rest of the season. Fellow rookie Dont'e Thornton Jr. might benefit as well if you want to take a flier on him also.\nOne other trade to note was Adonai Mitchell being thrown into the Sauce Gardner deal with the Colts and Jets. Mitchell could emerge as the No. 2 receiver for the Jets this season behind Garrett Wilson, and Mitchell is worth adding in deeper leagues, as well as all dynasty formats.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU's search for a football coach continues to draw national attention, and intrigue in the job spiked again when one of the school's most prominent alumni indicated former coach Nick Saban could be a candidate. Shaquille O'Neal, the four-time NBA champion and Basketball Hall of Famer who played for the Tigers from 1989 to 1992, said he heard LSU may be in talks Saban about a return to Baton Rouge.\"I heard through the grapevine that they were having conversations with Nick Saban,\" O'Neal told Us Weekly. \"That'd be awesome if we can bring Nick back.\"Verge Ausberry, the school's interim athletic director, quickly put that notion to rest.\"Nick Saban and I have a standing conversation probably every two or three weeks,\" Ausberry said on 104.5 ESPN. \"We're good friends, first of all. He's a person I admire a lot. Coach Saban was joking. No way he's coming back to football, okay? Miss Terry's not going to let him. That's not going to happen. Let's get that out of the way soon, because if he was and he was interested, I would drive down there and pick him up right now.\"Saban, 74, led LSU from 2000-04, capturing a national championship before departing for the NFL. He returned to college football in 2007 at Alabama, building one of the most dominant dynasties with six more national titles before retiring in 2023. This past weekend on ESPN's College GameDay, Saban addressed speculation of a potential return to coaching and emphasized that tradition alone does not guarantee success in modern college football.\n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov. Jeff Landry's power play took down LSU's AD -- and what comes next\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"You've got all these external factors that are constantly changing,\" Saban said. \"Whether it's the transfer portal, how much you can pay guys, revenue sharing, what kind of collective do you have? So, traditionally, how have you been able to adapt to that? ... Some of the traditional jobs, like LSU, that people always looked at as one of the best jobs, have they adapted to all these things like they need to to continue to be one of the best jobs in the country?\"\nSaban later clarified that he has no plans to return to coaching.For O'Neal, the focus remains on patience and optimism for LSU's next hire. \"We're just gonna sit and see who they choose,\" he said. \"I know it will definitely be a winner and I know it'll be somebody that's in line with our culture. I know it's somebody who's going to bring us back to winning. We realize if you lose more than two games, we don't get a significant bowl game.\"\nLSU fired Brian Kelly Oct. 26 after a 5-3 start in his fourth season. Kelly finished 34-14, with a single SEC Championship Game appearance, but was unable to get the Tigers to the College Football Playoff to contend for a national title. The decision led to the resignation of athletic director Scott Woodward, who had fallen out of favor with LSU stakeholders, including Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Three days removed from Clemson's 46-45 loss to Duke, coach Dabo Swinney remains up in arms over the officiating and a controversial pass interference call that played a key role in the Blue Devils' game-winning drive. Swinney, who ripped the officials over \"one of the worst calls\" he has ever seen, made big-picture arguments on Tuesday and called for reform. Specifically, the two-time national champion pleaded for more accountability from officials and a requirement that they be full-time employees.Swinney this week received a public reprimand from the ACC over his postgame comments about the officials. The conference also hit Clemson with a $10,000 fine for what it deemed was a violation of league policy.\"Coaches get crucified, fined,\" Swinney said Tuesday. \"Players get crucified, held to this unrealistic accountability standard. But refs have zero accountability. They do, but it's behind a curtain. They get to go home and drink a beer and get on with their life and just leave the carnage left behind that affects a lot of people -- people losing jobs. That system needs to change.\"\n        \n            \n                Dabo Swinney stands by bad officiating remarks following ACC reprimand, Clemson fined after Duke loss\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDabo Swinney: Refs should have 'public accountability'The call that made Swinney irate came with less than a minute left in the Week 10 loss to Duke. The Blue Devils trailed by a touchdown, and on fourth down, quarterback Darian Mensah fired a deep ball that fell incomplete for what appeared to be a turnover on downs until officials flagged Clemson defensive back Avieon Terrell for a pass interference penalty that kept the drive alive and set up Duke's go-ahead touchdown.Terrell took the brunt of the contact with Duke receiver Que'Sean Brown on the play and fell to the ground as a result of the collision. He wound up as the guilty party in a call that left Clemson players and coaches dumbfounded.\n\"They need to be full-time refs, and it needs to be a job,\" Swinney said. \"There needs to be one leader and one voice. That's what it should be, number one. And then there should be public accountability. Period. You can't criticize them? They're the only ones in the arena that have no consequences publicly. God forbid you get to pay a fine because you criticize performance, but yet everybody else can be criticized. It's a bad system, the way it's set up.\"\n        \n            \n                After latest loss, Dabo Swinney says 'I may get fired ... can't say I'd blame him' with Clemson AD looking on\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe questionable call and resulting loss presents another batch of adversity for a Clemson program that has fallen dramatically short of expectations this season. The latest defeat is the fifth on the year and sent the Tigers tumbling further to 3-5 on the year.\"We've got gambling issues going on, people being suspended, all that kind of stuff, right?\" Swinney said. \"Refs are people, too. It ain't just coaches and players. If they're a part of the game, then by God, they ought to be a part of the game. They ought to be a part of the accountability. They ought to be a part of the consequences, not just behind some shadowy curtain.\"\nTuesday's media availability was the third public appearance -- following his postgame press conference and Sunday's teleconference -- in which Swinney blasted the officials for the pass interference call.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL playoffs kick off with a six-game slate as part of NFL Super Wild Card Weekend. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos secured first-round byes as the top seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively, and 12 other teams will be fighting to advance to the Divisional Round next week. Many teams were able to rest starters in Week 18 to get healthy for the playoffs, but there are still some notable injuries that bettors should keep in mind for these six wild card games. Here, we break down those injuries as well as the latest NFL betting lines from DraftKings Sportsbook. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.Packers at Bears (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)GB QB Jordan Love (concussion, will play)GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, active)GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, out)CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, will play)\nThe Packers get Jordan Love back after he was banged up to close out the year, and his backup, Malik Willis, was questionable to suit up behind him, though he's active Saturday. Additionally, receiver Dontayvion Wicks is out for Green Bay after a 332-yard season. As for Chicago, the Bears will get receiver Rome Odunze back after a foot injury cost him considerable time late in the season. Odunze missed the final five games of 2025 after tallying 661 yards and six touchdowns over 12 games. Green Bay is a slight 1.5-point favorite on the road here, and the total is 44.5.Bills at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET, Sunday)BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, will play)BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, questionable)\nThis matchup sees the No. 1 rushing offense in the Bills face off with the Jaguars' No. 1-ranked run defense. That will be a key matchup to watch, and Buffalo receiving back Ty Johnson is questionable. He had 263 receiving yards and five total touchdowns as the backup to NFL rushing leader James Cook. The good news for the Bills is Josh Allen's favorite target is back, as tight end Dalton Kincaid is off the injury report after missing considerable time with a nagging knee injury.Buffalo is a 1.5-point road favorite. And at 51.5, this total is the highest of the entire six-game Wild Card Weekend slate.49ers at Eagles (4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, questionable)PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, questionable)\nAfter missing nearly half of the season, star Philadelphia right tackle Lane Johnson appears to be on track to return to the lineup on Sunday as he practiced this week and is listed as questionable. The 49ers are also hoping to get their star tackle back as left tackle Trent Williams is questionable after missing Week 18. Second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is also questionable. He's missed eight games in 2025.The Eagles are -6 on the spread and the total is 44.5.Chargers at Patriots (8 p.m. ET, Sunday)LAC RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, questionable)NE WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring, questionable)\nThe Chargers have been utterly decimated by injuries on offense this year, particularly at running back and offensive line. Star rookie back Omarion Hampton missed eight games this year but still compiled 737 scrimmage yards and five touchdowns in nine games. He's questionable for this contest with an ankle injury, though he told reporters he expects to play on Sunday. As for the Patriots, explosive receiver Kayshon Boutte is questionable. He cooled off after a three-week stretch with four touchdowns, but Boutte can take the tops off of defenses for Drake Maye. New England is favored by 3.5 points. The total is 45.5.Texans at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)PITT RB Jaylen Warren (illness, TBD)\nThe final injury report for this Monday showdown doesn't come out until Saturday, but one big name who missed practice this week is Steelers starting running back Jaylen Warren. Warren is dealing with an illness, per the report, which is likely a better sign than a different injury. Warren had 958 rushing yards in his first full season as the Steelers' lead running back. Houston is favored by 3-points. The total is 38.5 -- the lowest of the first round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL's head coach hiring cycle was turned on its head last week when the Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh.While the hourglass on his time in Baltimore ran out, Harbaugh instantly became the top candidate on the market for the remaining seven teams looking to fill a head coaching vacancy. His availability has prompted teams to reach out in earnest to set up meetings to pitch the veteran head coach on joining their franchise. Harbaugh has yet to interview for any openings officially, but that will change in a week's time.Harbaugh told Fox Sports that while plenty of teams have reached out, he's going to narrow his search to roughly three or four teams and then go through the interview process with those franchises. As Harbaugh scouts for his next destination in the NFL, let's do the same. Below, we'll rank the three best fits for the head coach.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Tennessee TitansAccording to The Athletic, Harbaugh is spending the next few days watching film on a couple of young quarterbacks, including Cam Ward. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft flashed down the stretch of his rookie year, albeit during a forgettable 3-14 campaign for Tennessee. If Harbaugh believes Ward can become a true franchise centerpiece, the Titans are an attractive destination because they are effectively a blank slate outside of quarterback.Yes, the roster needs to be rebuilt, but the organization has the ammunition to jump-start a turnaround. The Titans are armed with a projected $113 million in cap space, the most in the NFL at the moment. On top of that, they have the fourth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and the presence of Ward allows them to take one of the best non-QB prospects in the class. When you pair those assets with Ward, it's a strong starting point for Harbaugh.\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these eight jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Atlanta FalconsA Matt Ryan-John Harbaugh-led Falcons franchise feels like an awfully powerful duo. The franchise has already hired its former MVP quarterback as its first-ever president of football, and now it needs to find a head coach to replace Raheem Morris. If Atlanta were to lure Harbaugh, it would instantly possess one of the top brain trusts in the league, which is something Harbaugh likely recognizes as well.\nFrom a football perspective, the Falcons are a strong candidate on a couple of different fronts. They have loads of star power on the roster. Offensively, Bijan Robinson is one of the best running backs in the NFL, while wideout Drake London is an up-and-coming star at the position in his own right. On defense, the unit features All-Pro cornerback A.J. Terrell and some fascinating first-year players, such as pass rusher James Pearce Jr. and safety Xavier Watts. On top of that, the Falcons play in a very winnable division in the NFC South.The major sticking point with this possible pairing is the quarterback position, specifically Harbaugh's view of Michael Penix Jr. The former first-round pick is coming off a season-ending ACL tear and has been up and down over the course of his young career. If Harbaugh thinks he can win with Penix, then the Falcons check a ton of boxes.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New York GiantsThere's a really good argument to be made for the Giants as the top job for Harbaugh. We noted that Cam Ward was one of the quarterbacks Harbaugh is reportedly watching tape on -- well, so is Jaxson Dart. \nNew York is a destination that has a young quarterback in place, and Dart flashed a tremendously high ceiling during his rookie campaign. That said, he'll need to be reined in with some of his scrambling, which Harbaugh should view as an easy fix. Once Dart gets that honed in, he'll be quite the dual-threat quarterback, which Harbaugh knows something about after coaching Lamar Jackson to two NFL MVP awards.But the Giants are not just a good fit because of Dart. The roster has potential, with wideout Malik Nabers and running back Cam Skattebo headlining a young skill-position group, along with a defensive line that features Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence and Abdul Carter. New York also has the fifth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, so there is another avenue to bring in an instant-impact player. This is the type of group that can turn around in a hurry with the right coach, like Harbaugh.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs roll on Sunday with three more games -- Jaguars vs. Bills (+1.5), 49ers vs. Eagles (-6) and Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5). A majority of the daily Fantasy football action will take all three games into account for the 'main slate.' It's a smaller NFL DFS player pool on Sunday than the regular season, but larger than Saturday and Monday during Wild Card Weekend, so there are some tougher calls to make for NFL DFS lineups.How should you value big names like Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, Christian McCaffrey, James Cook and Justin Herbert, and who are the NFL DFS picks who can be sleepers for this slate? Before making any Sunday NFL DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Hurts as an anytime TD scorer (+105) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Wild Card Sunday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Wild Card SundayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Sunday is Eagles running back Saquon Barkley at $8,500 on FanDuel and $7,000 on DraftKings. Barkley had an epic playoff run last year, leading the NFL with 499 rushing yards as he averaged 124.8 yards on the ground over the course of four games. That effort was highlighted by a 205-yard game against the Rams. The Niners were below average defending running backs this season, giving up the 19th-most Fantasy points to opposing backs. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Barkley to go Over 82.5 rushing yards at DraftKings Sportsbook:\nMcClure is also building around Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid ($3,800 on DraftKings, $5,100 on FanDuel), who gets a very favorable matchup against the Jags, a team that has allowed the 22nd-most points to opposing tight ends. With injuries playing a factor, Kincaid's total targets and receptions have been down a bit this season, but he's been more efficient than ever. He averaged a cater-high 14.6 yards per catch and scored a career-high five touchdowns this season. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Kincaid to go Over 41.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Wild Card Sunday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

What happens when a player who relies on extreme pull tendencies for his power is subjected to the ballpark with the deepest outfield corners -- namely, going from the one pictured on the left below to the one pictured on the right?\n                                                                    via Wikipedia\n                                                            Predictably, it doesn't go well. See how the Wrigley Field fence actually moves back as it nears the corners? That makes for 40 extra feet at the foul pole around which Paredes lives, and those 40 extra feet made a world of difference. Paredes hit .223 with three homers and a .633 OPS in his 52 games for the Cubs late in 2024.\nBut then what happened when Paredes returned to a ballpark well-suited for his swing -- incidentally, the same one where Bregman has spent the majority of his career? Why, he went on to deliver a very Bregman-like stat line: .254 with 20 homers and a .809 OPS in the 102 games that he was healthy.So if Paredes produces much like Bregman in Houston, what are the chances Bregman will produce much like Paredes in Chicago?I don't want to overstate the case. I'd be reckless for doing so given the dissimilar stature of the two players. But Paredes and Bregman are hitters of a similar kind, both relying on optimal angles rather than optimal impact to deliver their home runs. Bregman hits the ball harder than Paredes, sure, but his exit velocities still typically rank in the lower half the of league. His pull tendencies aren't as extreme as Paredes', but ... well, they're pretty extreme:\n\n                                                                    via FanGraphs\n                                                            Notice that most of those black dots are going into the same protruded corner that ruined Paredes in Chicago.Now, the obvious counter for this admittedly bearish outlook would be Statcast, which estimates that Bregman would have actually hit one more home run if he had played every game at Wrigley Field last year, but I've already mentioned the difficulties in modeling home runs at that particular venue. We've discussed the shape of the fence, which defies convention by becoming deeper at points where every other fence becomes shallower, but the trickier variable than that, even, is the wind.Located on the Lake Michigan side of the Windy City, Wrigley Field is impacted more by wind than any other venue. Historically, it's been a boon for hitters, but more recent patterns have seen the wind blow in more often than out. The actual 2025 count is 51 games \"in\" and 19 games \"out,\" according to Jesse Rogers of ESPN.\nIf it's fringe power to begin with, it's likely to be warning track power against 15 mph headwinds.Given his hitting profile and the way it's perfectly suited for the past venues he's called home, I've feared the day when Bregman, a longtime favorite of mine in Fantasy, played half his games at a more ordinary venue. This one isn't even ordinary but perhaps the worst-case scenario. Maybe his hitting instincts and fiercely competitive nature will elevate him beyond his batted-ball tendencies, perhaps even reshaping them to his new circumstances. Maybe the wind patterns will change at Wrigley or he'll be so good on the road that none of these concerns end up mattering.But seeing as Bregman has been bleeding value over the past few years, going from an early-round mainstay to more of a mid-round fallback option in most scoring formats, I think we've all sensed him teetering on the edge of Fantasy significance. This venue change seems consequential enough to topple him over, and so for the first time ever in his long career, I'm saying I'm out on Bregman, at least if he continues to be drafted in the 120 range. Frankly, I'd rather have Paredes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL playoffs kicked off with a bang Saturday, as the doubleheader featured two wildly entertaining matchups that came down to the wire. When the dust settled, the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears were the teams advancing to the divisional round.The Rams pulled off their victory on the road against the NFC South champion Carolina Panthers. While Los Angeles was a double-digit favorite, it was put on upset alert, falling behind 31-27 with a little over two minutes left in regulation. With its back against the wall, Matthew Stafford orchestrated a 71-yard touchdown drive to put the Rams back in front and keep their season alive.The drama didn't stop there, as the Chicago Bears pulled off a comeback for the ages, erasing an 18-point lead by the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field. Caleb Williams led a fourth-quarter rally in which the Bears outscored the Packers 25-6. The second-year quarterback made several impressive throws as he clawed his team back into the game.Now that the games are in the books, we're trying to digest what just happened as storylines begin to pour out. But which are overreactions, and which should be taken seriously? Below, we'll comb through the notable takeaways from Day 1 of Wild Card Weekend and assess what's real and what's overblown.\nRams' defense and special teams will be their demiseOverreaction or reality: RealityEven after narrowly escaping the Panthers, the Rams still have a Super Bowl ceiling thanks to the brain trust of Stafford and Sean McVay. However, if they fall short of hoisting a second Lombardi Trophy during this Stafford era, it would likely be due to the other two phases of the game: defense and special teams. The L.A. defense didn't have many answers for Bryce Young and the Panthers' passing attack. Jalen Coker lit them up for 134 yards and a touchdown, while Tetairoa McMillan averaged 16.2 yards per reception. With elevated competition on deck, the further the Rams advance, the more that deficiency could be exposed.As for special teams, this has been a problem for the Rams all season. Their shortcomings were on full display down the stretch of the regular season -- particularly in the Week 16 loss to Seattle that knocked them out of the race for the No. 1 seed -- and it reared its head again Saturday night. Late in the fourth quarter, the Panthers blocked an L.A. punt, giving the Carolina offense the ball at the Rams' 30-yard line and setting up a touchdown drive to take the lead with just over two minutes remaining in regulation.\nThat miscue nearly cost them the game, if not for Stafford orchestrating a game-winning touchdown drive on the ensuing possession. Next time, they may not be as fortunate.Panthers can't win with Bryce Young at QBOverreaction or reality: Overreaction\nWhile quarterbacks are often judged by whether they win in the postseason, that doesn't mean we should close the book on Bryce Young because he lost his playoff debut. In fact, the Carolina quarterback was solid. He completed 21 of 40 passes for 264 yards, a touchdown and an interception. That pick wasn't entirely his fault, as Coker, his intended receiver, slowed up on his route.Young rose to the occasion late in the fourth quarter, leading a go-ahead touchdown drive that featured some nifty passes. First, he zipped an RPO throw to Tetairoa McMillan for 16 yards.\nWith the ball on the Rams' 7-yard line, Young then dropped it in the bucket on a fade pass to Coker for a touchdown. For a moment, it looked like it would be the game-winning score, but Stafford put together a winning drive of his own on the next possession. Still, Young held up his end of the bargain.\nYoung has been a polarizing figure since Carolina selected him No. 1 overall in 2023, and his tenure has been bumpy, even including a benching during his sophomore season. However, this strong showing in his first taste of the playoffs should give the Panthers confidence they have a quarterback capable of leading them to the postseason. Matt LaFleur is on the hot seatOverreaction or reality: RealityThere was a report earlier Saturday from NFL Media that the Packers and Matt LaFleur plan to engage in contract extension talks after the season. However, plans can change, especially after blowing an 18-point lead to the Bears on Wild Card Weekend to be eliminated from the playoffs. It was the largest blown lead in franchise history.\n\"With all due respect to your question, now is not the time for that,\" LaFleur said postgame when asked if he believed he'd be back next season. \"I'm just hurting for these guys. I can only think about what just happened, and then there will be time for that.\"It was an utter collapse by LaFleur's Packers, who allowed Chicago to outscore them 28-6 in the second half. It's the type of loss that makes an organization reevaluate everything and can result in heads rolling, especially when it continues a pattern of falling short of expectations. This marks the second straight year Green Bay has been one-and-done in the postseason, and LaFleur's playoff record with the Packers has dropped to 3-6.\n                                                                    CBS Sports HQ\n                                                            LaFleur is entering a lame-duck season in 2026, so a decision on his future is likely to come to a head at some point this offseason. While it initially looked like he would ink an extension to keep lurking on the sidelines at Lambeau Field for years to come, this loss now puts him squarely on the hot seat.\nCaleb Williams has the clutch geneOverreaction or reality: Reality\nOne of the big takeaways from Chicago's miraculous comeback over the Packers was how well Caleb Williams played when the Bears needed him most. The former No. 1 overall pick made several tremendous throws down the stretch as he helped will Chicago back into the game.None was more impressive than a 27-yard throw to Rome Odunze on fourth-and-8 with the game effectively on the line. Williams was under pressure and rolled to his left, then threaded the needle, lofting the ball over the heads of Packers defenders and into Odunze's arms to move the sticks.\nFive plays later, he connected with Olamide Zaccheaus for a touchdown to pull Chicago within a field goal. \nWhile Williams makes some puzzlingly poor throws at times, there's no denying he has developed a clutch gene this season. He has been a key figure in Chicago pulling out multiple last-minute wins. Saturday's victory was the seventh this season when the Bears were down in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter, an NFL record including the playoffs. Chicago is also 3-3 when down 10 or more points in the final five minutes this season, while the rest of the NFL is 3-158.\n                                                                    CBS Sports HQ\n                                                            A good deal of the credit for that success goes to Williams. If he continues to rise in those pressure moments, Chicago becomes quite scary as it continues its playoff march.\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt's playoff time, baby.New season.Not for us it isn't. Our records carry over to the postseason, which means it's not really a new season like they say in the NFL locker rooms right now. Week 18 is always a challenge, but I went 9-7 last week both against the spread and straight up. That takes my season spread record to 140-129-3 and the straight-up record goes to 176-95-1.Landing 11 games over .500 against the spread is a nice way to close the regular season, but I expect to be even better in the playoffs. It's when the stars come out, isn't it?Let's go.Wild Card Weekend NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.\n        \n            \n                NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, predictions, expert picks: Best bets, where to watch, NFL playoffs, stream, more\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBuffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars (+1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis young Jaguars team is one of the bigger surprises in the league, but they do a lot of things well. They finished as the top run defense and no back ran for over 75 yards against them during the season. That will be big against James Cook, who led the league in rushing. If they can stop Cook, that will put a lot on Josh Allen, who is more than capable. On the other side, the Bills have had defensive issues, while the Jaguars have played well on offense with Trevor Lawrence. Look for that to continue. This will be fun to watch as both quarterbacks light it up with Lawrence winning it late.Pick: Jaguars 32, Bills 28San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (-5.5)Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles come in with a dominating defense, while the 49ers have a good offense. That's the matchup that will decide the game. The 49ers defense has struggled all year, while the Eagles offense has as well. Something has to give. I think the Eagles offense will get it going some here against the 49ers defense. Look for a big game from Saquon Barkley. On the other side, I look for the Eagles to limit Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense. The Eagles get it going some on offense and advance to the next round.Pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 17Los Angeles Chargers (+3.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 8 p.m. ET on NBC\nThis is a long trip for the Chargers. It's also a big game for quarterback Justin Herbert, who has yet to win a playoff game. The problem is the offensive line in front of him has issues. The Patriots defense should be able to limit the Chargers' run game and pressure Herbert. On the other side, the Chargers have a top 10 defense and that could challenge Drake Maye. The Patriots have averaged 168.6 rushing yards per game and 5.8 yards per carry over the last five games, so look for them to run it early and often. If Herbert isn't protected on the other side, it could be a long night for the Chargers. But this is Maye's first playoff game and the Chargers defense is good against the pass. It's close, but the Pats win it late.   Pick: Patriots 24, Chargers 23Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Texans have one of the best defenses in the league and that can be a problem for a Steelers offense that is just OK. Aaron Rodgers does have a lot of playoff experience, which matters. He also gets back DK Metcalf in this one, which is big. The Steelers offensive line has also been good as of late. The Texans offense has been better during a nine-game winning streak, but this will come down to Houston's offensive line against the Steelers' front. That's a problem. Look for the Steelers to force some mistakes by C.J. Stroud as Pittsburgh advances behind its defensive front in a playoff upset.Pick: Steelers 23, Texans 20Green Bay Packers (-1.5) at Chicago BearsSaturday, 8 p.m. ET on Amazon Prime\nThese two teams split during the regular season, but the Packers blew the second one by not recovering an onside kick late. Both teams come limping in here as the Packers have lost four in a row and the Bears have lost two straight. The Bears have defensive issues that have shown up lately that Jordan Love, who will be back, can exploit. The Packers will go after Caleb Williams like they did in the two other meetings. That could lead to a lot of big plays and a lot of points for both teams -- if the weather isn't a disaster. In the end, the Packers and Love will get the best of it.Pick: Packers 27, Bears 24Los Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina PanthersSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Panthers beat the Rams in Week 13 thanks to a lot of big plays by both the offense and defense. Matthew Stafford threw three picks in that game. That won't happen again. Look for a much better offensive effort from the Rams. The Panthers ran it well against the Rams in the last meeting, so that will again be the focus here. Bryce Young also made some key throws in that game. But this is a big challenge for a young Panthers team. The Rams are playoff tested and Stafford and gang will play like it. Rams big.Pick: Rams 31, Panthers 17\n            ",

L.A. is also facing a team with an 8-9 record, and teams with losing records are 2-6 in the playoffs all-time. The Rams have the league's best offense, ranking first in points, total yards and yards per play, and it's a unit that doesn't hurt itself as no one has committed fewer penalties. Matthew Stafford has two touchdowns and no interceptions in each of his last three postseason starts, and the MVP contender is riding a seven-game playoff streak with multiple touchdown passes. This season, Stafford has more TD passes (46) than Carolina has total touchdowns (35) as the Panthers rank 27th in both points scored and total yards. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Panthers can coverIt was just six weeks ago that Carolina upset the Rams as double-digit underdogs, forcing Stafford into three turnovers.

The Rams have lost three of their last four road games, and the Panthers are decidedly more potent on offense at Bank of America Stadium.

That means they'll be wearing their Navy jersey with their Navy pants. It's a combination that the Bears have only worn six times in franchise history and they've gone 0-6 in those games, including 0-4 against the Packers. First, let's take a look at the threads. \nThe Bears played eight home games during the regular season and they wore the same thing in each game: Their Navy jersey with white pants. The all-Navy look that they'll be wearing on Saturday night will mark the first time in three years that they've gone with their Navy jersey combined with their Navy Pants. \nThe Bears first wore the all-Navy look in 2002 and here's how their six games have gone in the uniforms over the past 23 years:  2002 (Week 5): Packers 34-21 over Bears2006 (Week 17): Packers 26-7 over Bears2016 (Week 7): Packers 26-10 over Bears2017 (Week 1): Falcons 23-17 over Bears2017 (Week 4): Packers 35-14 over Bears2022 (Week 18: Vikings 29-13 over BearsNot only are the Bears 0-6, but they've lost those six games by an average of 15.2 points per game. \nThe Bears are facing the Packers in a postseason game for the third time in franchise history. Despite playing at home, Chicago is going into the game as a 2.5-point underdog. The Bears haven't won a playoff game since the 2010 season, which is tied for the third-longest drought in the NFL, and for some reason, they've decided to try and end that drought by wearing a uniform combination that they've never won in. \n            \n    ",

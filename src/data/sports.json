The Americans have outscored opponents 31-1, and they've posted shutouts in five straight games. Team USA has hardly broken a sweat, but the history of its rivalry with Canada suggests that may change in the final.There have been seven Olympics featuring women's ice hockey, and the gold medal game has featured U.S. vs. Canada six times. The Canadians are 4-2 in those games with four of them ending in a 3-2 score -- and two of those went into overtime. There is rarely much room between these two teams, although the Americans did hand the Canadians a 5-0 loss in the preliminary round.Team USA has simply been operating on a different level than everyone else in Italy. That starts with defender Caroline Harvey, who leads the tournament with nine points. First-time Olympian Laila Edwards has burst onto the scene with seven points as she ascends toward stardom, and Abbey Murphy seems to be at the center of every big play.The gold medal game will also be the last Olympic appearance for captain Hilary Knight, who is seeking her fifth Olympic medal and second gold. Knight is also one goal and one point away from breaking a pair of all-time U.S. women's hockey Olympic records.Can Team USA finish off one of the most dominant runs in Olympic history?

Hughes sealed a 2-1 win over Sweden on Wednesday, and the Americans are through to the medal round to face Slovakia in the semifinals.The Americans held a 1-0 lead for much of the contest, but a late goal by Sweden's Mika Zibanejad tied the game with just 1:31 left in regulation. The game went into a 10-minute three-on-three period, and the Americans regrouped to control overtime and pull out the win.On the game-winning goal, Hughes used his elite skating and stick-handling to create just enough space for a powerful wrist shot that beat Swedish goalie Jacob Markstrom.\nDylan Larkin, who his best game of the tournament, scored the other goal for the Americans as he turned in his best performance of these Olympics. Larkin was also key in disrupting Sweden's only power play of the game, which came in the third period. Connor Hellebuyck was nearly perfect in goal as he turned away 28 of the 29 Swedish shots that came his way. It was a little too close for comfort, but Team USA will face Slovakia on Friday. The Slovakians, led by Montreal Canadiens star Juraj Slafkovsky, have been on a magical run thus far. Puck drop for that matchup is set for 3:10 p.m. ET.Since NHL players first went to the Olympics in 1998, the Americans have never medaled outside of North America.

    "body": "\n        The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), the union that represents those on the 40-player roster for each MLB club, has named Bruce Meyer as the interim executive director for the organization, the group announced late Wednesday. The decision is the result of a unanimous vote by the union's executive board of 72 players and came after Tony Clark unexpectedly resigned from the lead post earlier this week. Clark's decision was made after an internal investigation reportedly revealed he was engaged in an \"inappropriate\" relationship with his sister-in-law, who had been an MLBPA employee since 2023. As well, Clark and the MLBPA are under federal investigation by the Eastern District of New York over whether a licensing company co-founded by the MLBPA and the NFL players union, OneTeam Partners, was being used to financially enrich the union leaders. The full scope of the investigation into the company is unclear, but members of the executive subcommittee have been in contact with federal officials, according to The Athletic. At the same time, an MLBPA-owned youth baseball company, Players Way, is also under investigation for alleged financial impropriety. The company is alleged to have held few live events for youth players despite the MLBPA's investing almost $4 million in the company. Players Way executives and consultants reportedly received six-figure salaries. \n        \n            \n                MLBPA head Tony Clark resigns after alleged 'inappropriate' relationship, months before CBA expires\n                \n                    Kate Feldman                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nClark, 53, joined the MLBPA in 2010 following a 15-year playing career. He was unanimously approved as the union's executive director in December 2013, following the death of Michael Weiner. Clark has overseen the last two CBA negotiations.\"Just on a personal level I think we're all fairly devastated by things that have happened in the last 48, 72 hours,\" Meyer told reporters Wednesday from spring training in Arizona, via the Associated Press, as part of his remarks before being named interim. \"I'm not going to go beyond that in terms of personal feelings, but it's fair to say that we were all personally upset, concerned about Tony. But I think this was something that the players determined had to happen at this particular point in time.\"\nMeyer, 64, has served as the union's lead negotiator since 2018. After helming the negotiations on the current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in 2021, Meyer was promoted to deputy executive director, Clark's No. 2, in the summer of 2022. Prior to joining the MLBPA, Meyer worked in an executive capacity for the NHL Players Association, and before that he was a long-time attorney in private practice. Matt Nussbaum, a labor lawyer who joined the MLBPA in 2011 after several years at the NHLPA, was named the interim deputy executive director.\n        \n            \n                Six major issues for Tony Clark's MLBPA replacement: Salary cap, international draft, more negotiating tasks\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe change in leadership comes at a seemingly inopportune time for the MLBPA, as negotiations on the next CBA should soon begin in earnest. Those negotiations are expected to be contentious, as MLB owners are widely expected to lock out the players after the current CBA expires in December of this year. Commissioner Rob Manfred at the behest of owners is expected to push for a salary cap on team payrolls during the CBA negotiations, and the union is expected to resist those efforts, as they've always done. \n\"We don't expect anything to change in terms of bargaining,\" Meyer said Wednesday. \"We've been preparing for bargaining for years. Players have been preparing. Players know what's coming. At the end of the day, leadership is important and leadership comes and goes, but what remains is the players. At the end of the day, it's the players who determine the direction of the union. At the end of the day, it's the players who determine our priorities and bargaining. Those priorities obviously have not changed and will not change.\"Meyer had been slated to lead those negotiations from the union side, so his appointment to the interim leadership role is as seamless as such a thing can be given the unexpected nature of the recent upheavals. Meyer's ascent within the union has not been without obstacles. In December of 2024, three former members of the MLBPA's executive subcommittee -- Jack Flaherty, Lucas Giolito, and Ian Happ -- angled to remove Meyer as the union's deputy director. However, the three players were then voted off of the subcommittee, and Meyer survived. Now he leads the union into an uncertain future and likely becomes the favorite to take over leadership of the MLBPA on a permanent basis, whenever such a decision will be made. First, though, comes the profound challenges of leading the players into what could be the most damaging labor dispute the sport has seen in more than a generation.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal have lost their heads. There is no other rational explanation for how the Premier League leaders, for now at least, could blow a two-goal lead against a side who will cherish this 2-2 draw because it makes it that much less likely they will go down in history as statistically the worst team in this competition's history.Three years of second-placed finishes has led to a familiar refrain around Arsenal, that they are bottlers, a team chronically incapable of winning the biggest prizes. It had been, without wishing to put too fine a point on it, nonsense. The team of 2022-23 got way out ahead of their skis early on but never looked like one that could stay the course when the juggernaut of prime Manchester City built a head of steam. A year later, Mikel Arteta's men were brilliant down the stretch, dropping only five points in their final 14 games. Unfortunately for them, City dropped four. In 2024-25, the title charge never got going because from early on, Arsenal found themselves banjaxed by injuries.Now they are probably the best team in the land. That is how they got to the stage where they are five points clear with a game in hand, still the bookmakers' favorites to win both the Champions League and the Premier League. Theirs is the best defense around and frankly, there is not that much evidence of a superteam to rival them, not when Manchester City haven't really exploited the openings that the leaders keep giving them.This is the truth most fair-minded observers would offer up over Arsenal. It would appear that Arsenal's truth is rather different. They play like a team who have ingested the worst that social media has to say about them. A team that believe there is something innate within them that is not within champions, who see the last seven games not as the sort of wobble they can get away with this year but a sign of the doom that is soon to come. When misfortune comes their way, they respond as if it were inevitable.\nAnd this was another game with a healthy slice of bad luck. In the 56th minute, Piero Hincapie was adjudged to have been onside when he darted onto Gabriel's through ball and clipped a shot over Jose Sa, at that point, this had the feel of a professional away performance. Yes, the visitors had been under Wolverhampton Wanderers' cosh to start the second half, but this is the Premier League. Even the easy games are never that easy.Still, there was nothing to fear. All Arsenal were allowing Wolves was pot sho... aaah, there's another one of them flying past David Raya. Hugo Bueno, making amends for playing Hincapie on in spectacular fashion. Make that six Premier League goals conceded where the shot has an xG value of 0.04 or lower. No team in the division has conceded more. Now, maybe, maybe, maybe there is something in how Arteta sets up his backline. Even a defense as good as Arsenal's has to allow something. Could Hincapie have been out quicker? Should he not have shown the out-of-position left back the outside rather than inviting the shot? Maybe, maybe, maybe but this is still the sort of chance that flies high, wide and not particularly handsome far more often than not. This just seems to be the year where that doesn't happen to Arsenal. The xG value of the 20 shots they have conceded is just 3.16. Since 2020-21, there has not been such a discrepancy for any team in the Premier League. \n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            So, of course, it is possible to frame this game as another in the long line of footballings that have happened to Arsenal in this run of 10 points gained and 11 dropped over their last seven matches. You might as well file this alongside the Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu thunderbolts or the almighty fright that Eli Junior Kroupi gave to this team. The Arsenal players certainly did.\"Any question, any criticism, any opinion, you have to take it on the chin today,\" said Arteta. \"That's it. Any bullet, take it, because we didn't perform at the level that is required.\"This was a group of contenders for the biggest titles in the sport who were resolutely unable to take control of a contest against an already relegated opponent. In the half hour between Bueno's goal and Tom Edozie's equalizer, they did not allow a single shot. They only took one though and found themselves outpossessed and outpassed, 106 to 104. \nOn the touchline, Arteta was pleading with his players to calm down but they showed no signs of listening. Too many hoofed clearances to Viktor Gyokeres and latterly Gabriel Jesus. Martin Zubimendi may not have been deployed as a Rodri-style 100-pass-a-game metronome but something has gone wrong when he completes only 12 in half an hour, especially when Declan Rice's radar is so off. Might this have been different if Martin Odegaard were fit? He is the man who can get Arsenal to control the game, to kill a contest with a few hundred passes. Wasn't the whole point of this summer's spending, however, to kick the reliance on individuals?Without control and without threat, Arsenal demanded high standards of their defense. They cannot always live up to those. Gabriel and Raya got themselves in a mess, the ball dropping for Edozie to strike on his debut. There was no fight from Arsenal in the minutes that followed, well at least until the referee had blown up and Jesus shoved Yerson Mosquera.Raising yourself only after the battle is lost, we have seen that before in this competition and it is invariably from the teams who are bottling the title race. It's Kevin Keegan ranting at the Sky cameras, it's William Gallas indulging himself in a little sulk on the St. Andrew's field. It wasn't really Arteta's Arsenal. At least it wasn't before Wednesday. And yet already this feels like a team who expect to etch themselves into the wrong sort of history books.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Availability is often the most underrated skill in fantasy basketball. While per-game production grabs headlines, games played ultimately decide matchups — especially as the season pushes past the All-Star break. In this breakdown, we spotlight 10 top-100 points-per-game producers who have missed no more than two contests all season, giving managers both reliability and impact. From iron men like Mikal Bridges to steady stars such as Julius Randle and Scottie Barnes, these players combine durability with strong category production — a powerful formula for fantasy success down the stretch.Julius Randle, Timberwolves - 56 games played (zero missed)Randle leads the way in scoring among the most available players this season, averaging 22.3 points per game on 49.2 percent shooting. He also continues to deliver solid production across the board with seven rebounds, 5.4 assists, and 1.1 steals in 33.6 minutes per game. Additionally, he retains the ability to score from long range, averaging 1.6 3-pointers, while shooting 32.5 percent from beyond the arc. All these factors combine to make him an extremely valuable piece for any fantasy lineup, while also standing as a major factor in his team's success over the last couple of seasons. DeMar DeRozan - 56 games played (zero missed)Although the Kings' season is going just about as poorly as possible, DeRozan has been professional about showing up each game and delivering his patented offensive punch. On the other hand, the team struggles have certainly taken a toll on his ability to produce like he has in the past. He is averaging 18.7 points per game, which is his lowest mark since the 2012-13 season, while he is also playing 32.4 minutes per game, which is his lowest since his rookie campaign. With his squad well out of the playoff race, it is likely that his playing time and production continue to dwindle as the end of the season draws nearer. Naz Reid, Timberwolves - 56 games played (zero missed)Reid shines as one of the league's most valuable bench players. He continues to show an impressive ability to remain available, as he has played every game this season and missed only a total of three games since the start of the 2023-24 season. He is averaging 14.2 points per game, which ties his career high set last season, and he remains a legitimate 3-point threat, averaging 2.4 made 3s, while shooting 38.5 percent from deep on the season. The luxury of having a big man who can shoot and stay true to his defensive role in the paint, as he averages 6.4 rebounds and 0.9 blocks per game, is a major benefit for his squad.\nJeremiah Fears, Pelicans - 56 games played (zero missed)Fears opened his NBA career with a couple of impressive performances, totaling 30 points on 66.7 percent shooting through his first two games. The strong start led to him earning the starting point-guard job for the next 44 games, before being pushed back to a bench role over the most recent 10 games. He is averaging 13.2 points on 42.9 percent shooting, 3.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.3 steals in 25.6 minutes per game on the season, while standing out as one of the few players averaging over 20 minutes per appearance to not miss a game this season. At 19 years old, he still has plenty of time to grow and build on his repertoire, while already being established as a rising star for fantasy managers to watch. Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers - 56 games played (zero missed)Despite some inconsistency in his production, Camara is showing well for his third NBA season, averaging a career-high 13.1 points in 33.4 minutes per game, up from 32.7 minutes per game last season. His most notable improvement has been his 3-point shooting, as he is knocking down 2.6 3s per game, with a 37.1 percent success rate from beyond the arc. This, along with his reputation as a strong defender and a solid track record of availability, makes him an intriguing up-and-coming player at the wing. Donte DiVincenzo, Timberwolves - 56 games played (zero missed)DiVincenzo continues to provide solid value in a starting role with the Timberwolves, and like his two aforementioned teammates on this list, he has yet to miss a game this season. What makes his consistent availability this season even more impressive is the fact that he is averaging a career-high 31.2 minutes per game, leading to career highs of 4.2 assists and 1.4 steals per game. He also remains a strong threat from 3-point range, averaging 3.1 makes on 38.3 percent shooting from deep, but his total field-goal percentage is slumping at 41.2 percent, on track for his second straight season shooting below 44 percent from the field. \nMatas Buzelis, Bulls - 55 games played (zero missed)Despite a turbulent and injury-riddled season for the Bulls, Buzelis has been a great constant and is showing an impressive leap in his sophomore season. He is averaging career highs across the board with 15.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.7 steals, and 1.5 blocks in 28.3 minutes per game, emerging as one of the league's most well-rounded two-way contributors. He has the green light to continue to explore his game as a high-ranking option among the Bulls' now revamped roster, and he is likely to continue to prosper down the stretch of the campaign. Mikal Bridges, Knicks - 55 games played (zero missed)Bridges has been the prime example of an \"iron man\", having not missed a game in any of the last four seasons, even playing an 83rd game in 2022-23 due to his being part of a trade. He is also on pace to keep up the streak this year, in his eighth NBA season. His production remains steady and substantial for the role he plays as nearly a fifth option on the offensive end. Bridges averages 15.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 1.4 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, while shooting 50.4 percent from the field and 38.4 percent from deep. Combined with his availability, that makes him one of the most ideal players to roster in category leagues. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Hawks - 54 games played (two missed)Alexander-Walker is the only player on this list to have missed more than one game, but his season to date is worthy of recognition here based on the total number of games he has played, along with his massive jump in production. His average of 20.1 points per game is a major leap from his 9.4 points per game from last season and his career high of 11 points per game from his sophomore season. He is also averaging career highs in rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. Of course, the increased production is largely the result of increased playing time, which originally came into effect as a result of Trae Young's injury troubles. Nonetheless, the ability to handle the increased role with relatively impressive consistency is catapulting Alexander-Walker into a new echelon among NBA guards. \nScottie Barnes, Raptors - 54 games played (one missed)Scottie Barnes is quickly becoming noted as one of the league's better defenders, as he is averaging over one steal and one block for a third consecutive season. This is also his third straight season averaging over 19 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game, putting him on track to be a clear choice as one of the NBA's most well-rounded stars. Additionally, having missed just one game this season has him on pace to push for a career high in games played, which is a great sign for his squad, after he was limited to 65 games last season and just 60 games in 2023-24.\n            ",

    "body": "\nMike Wagner, a former Pro Bowl defensive back and a key member of the Pittsburgh Steelers' famed \"Steel Curtain\" defense, has died at the age of 76. Wagner spent his entire 10-year career with the Steelers. Over that span, he was named to two Pro Bowls and helped Pittsburgh win four Super Bowls over a six-year span. He was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor in 2020. \"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Mike Wagner, a tremendous player and an integral part of some of the most successful teams in Pittsburgh Steelers history,\" team president Art Rooney II said in a statement. \"As a member of four Super Bowl-winning teams, his toughness and consistency were paramount to our secondary. His contributions on the field were significant, but it was also his steady presence and team-first mentality that truly defined him.\" An 11th round pick in the 1971 NFL Draft, Wagner was part of a notable Pittsburgh draft class that also included future Hall of Fame linebacker Jack Ham and fellow future starters in defensive linemen Ernie Holmes and Dwight White, offensive lineman Gerry Mullins, tight end/offensive lineman Larry Brown and receiver Frank Lewis. Despite his low draft stock, Wagner cracked the Steelers' lineup as a rookie and a year later finished second on the team with six interceptions. A year later, he led the entire NFL with eight interceptions. In 1974, Wagner helped the Steelers win the franchise's first Super Bowl, recording one of Pittsburgh's three interceptions during Pittsburgh's 16-6 win over the Minnesota Vikings. A year later, he was named to his first of two consecutive Pro Bowls while helping Pittsburgh repeat as champions. His fourth quarter interception of Roger Staubach in Super Bowl X set up a field goal and helped the Steelers record a 21-17 win over the Cowboys. \nIn 1976, Wagner was one of a staggering eight Steelers defenders who were selected to the Pro Bowl. That season, Pittsburgh's defense recorded five shoutouts and allowed just 28 points over a nine-game span. Wagner remained a key component of the Steelers' defense when they won two more Super Bowls to close out the decade. In 1978, he filled the stat sheet with two interceptions, three forced fumbles and two sacks as Pittsburgh finished the season by defeating the Cowboys in the Super Bowl for a second time. In 1979, Wagner recorded four interceptions despite only playing in eight regular season games. The Steelers finished that season with a 31-19 win over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV. He retired after the 1980 season with 36 career interceptions, 12 fumble recoveries and five sacks. \"He will always be remembered as a champion,\" Rooney said, \"a great teammate, and a proud member of the Steelers family.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Inter lost 3-1 in the opening first leg of the Champions League playoffs against Bodo/Glimt, the Norwegian side that already won against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid earlier this season. The Nerazzurri will have another chance to bounce back next week in Milan when the second leg will take place on Tuesday at San Siro, but this is a worrying result for the side coached by Cristian Chivu for multiple reasons, especially a few days after they managed to win against Juventus in Milan over the weekend. On the other hand, Bodo/Glimt are no longer a surprise in the European tournament after they managed to win against both Manchester City in their home stadium before winning against Atletico Madrid away in the last match of the league phase. Bodo/Glimt have done what they were asked to -- taking advantage of the home stadium playing on artificial grass -- but Inter were also disappointing, even if we can definitely expect a different match next week in Milan. \nThe Nerazzurri conceded the opening goal in the first half with Sondre Fet before the equalizer of Francesco Pio Esposito before the end of the opening 45 minutes. The Italian striker was once again one of the best players of the team, scoring his second goal in a few days after the key one against Juventus over the weekend. Inter came back on the pitch with a different attitude, not with the right mentality, and conceded two more goals to the home team as former AC Milan striker Jens Hauge and Kasper Hogh set the result to the final 3-1 result. Inter, heavily rotated, struggled throughout the match. The intense atmosphere and the home side's momentum may have unsettled the Nerazzurri, but even so, more was expected from a team that reached the 2025 Champions League final.\nIronically, the best news of the day for Chivu's team came out of the game played at San Siro between AC Milan and Como as Massimiliano Allegri's side drew 1-1 and are now seven points behind the Serie A leaders, with the Derby della Madonnina coming up in two weeks at San Siro, a pivotal clash that will decide the race for the 2025-26 Scudetto.\nOn the other hand, the most worrying news of the day comes not just from the result itself but from the performance, as the Nerazzurri were not able to sustain the rhythm of the home team in the first half, also probably due to the frigid  Norwegian weather. As a consequence, Inter captain Lautaro Martinez left the pitch with a suspected muscular injury that will be assessed in the coming hours once the team is back in Italy, knowing that Inter will face Lecce away on Saturday before the second leg of the playoffs next week. \nInter will need to have a different attitude from the past two matches. Bodo/Glimt might not be the best opponent they have faced so far this season, but a win is mandatory to take the Nerazzurri to the next stage of the tournament before focusing on the Serie A race and potentially on the round of 16. But for Inter to move on, potentially facing Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, they are going to have to win by at least two goals to have a chance, forcing extra time with that margin, while a win of more than two goals sees them through and a one goal win, a draw or  loss resulting in them crashing out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As one of the most exciting, dynamic and often enigmatic superstars in the sport of boxing, Ryan Garcia typically walks to the beat of his own drum, which can often create opportunities that others don't receive. Take for instance the fact that Garcia (24-2, 20 KOs), who has never won a scheduled fight at 147 pounds and is fresh off of a lifeless defeat to WBA welterweight titleholder Rolando Romero last May, will challenge for Mario Barrios' WBC title on Saturday when the two meet in a headlining fight (DAZN PPV, 7:55 p.m. ET) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Garcia, 27, isn't just entering the fight against Barrios (29-2-2, 18 KOs) following a loss, he's also not that far removed from serving a one-year suspension for a failed a drug test following his 2024 win over Devin Haney (that later became a no contest), which led to his life publicly spiraling out of control amid drug use, a mental health episode and a series of racist rants on social media. One thing Garcia, besides his massive following on social media that features nearly 13 million followers on Instagram alone, has going for him is that when he's mentally present and prepared to fight, he has an almost electrifying combination of power and speed that is a potential problem for any elite foe. \n\"When I'm at the top of my game,\" Garcia told CBS Sports on Tuesday, \"I don't think anyone can really mess with me.\"The hardest part for anyone, from Garcia's fans and critics to Barrios, himself, is trying to figure out which version of \"King Ryan\" is going to walk through that door considering how many big moments in his career (when he got up off the canvas to knock out Luke Campbell in 2021) were immediately followed by low points (when he sat idle for more than a year battling mental health). Ryan Garcia's last five fightsOpponentDateResultRolando RomeroMay 2, 2025Unanimous decision lossDevin HaneyApril 20, 2024Unanimous decision win, later overturned to No Contest for failed drug testOscar DuarteDec. 2, 2023Eighth-round knockout winGervonta DavisApril 22, 2023Seventh-round knockout lossJavier FortunaJuly 16, 2022Sixth-round knockout winFor the record, Garcia believes there are justifiable reasons behind his poor performance against Romero (quickly referencing potential dark energy within the venue), he's just not willing to expand on them. And if his recent interviews are any indication, Garcia's behavior has seemingly alternated on the day between being a calm presence and a much more manic one, which only fuels his unpredictability, mostly because of how often he attempts mental warfare on his opponents.\"Most people don't know shit about boxing and I know a lot of people don't know anything about me,\" Garcia said. \"There are reasons why and I could explain them for the last performance I had but I'm not going to go into that. I feel like on Saturday, you are going to see something special from me. You are going to see a Ryan Garcia classic. That's it.\"Barrios, a 30-year-old native of San Antonio, enters as a firm betting underdog following his own string of uneven performances. For as great as he looked in retiring Yordenis Ugas in 2023 to claim the WBC interim title, both of his full title defenses have ended in frustrating draws, including against a 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last July. But even Barrios has had a difficult time trying to identify what to expect from Garcia.\"It's hard to say, really, where exactly he is at,\" Barrios told CBS Sports last week. \"I just have to prepare as if I have a focused Ryan in front of me, as they are saying. Everything else is kind of just background noise. We have to look at Ryan when he has been at his best and has looked extraordinary and just picture and imagine that is who we will be facing. Whatever version shows up, if it's any less, that's going to be for him to answer.\"I just feel like when Ryan faces adversity, he doesn't make the necessary adjustments and with this fight, I'm looking to go in there and exploit all of his weaknesses. I want to make him uncomfortable, I want to test his heart and test how bad he really wants to be in there.\"\nGarcia is well aware both of those who believe he doesn't deserve the title fight and those who question whether he can ever look as good again as he did in dropping Haney three times under the cloud of testing positive for ostarine. Forever the troll, however, Garcia's demeanor transformed from quiet confidence to theatrical disruptor when asked what the impact of a potential comeback stoppage win for him over Barrios would have on the boxing community at large.\"'Oh no, he's back! Oh no, he's really becoming what we didn't want him to become, the face of boxing. Oh no!'\" Garcia said while mimicking his critics. \"They are going to be real sad, the haters. But I'm just happy because I think I'm at a time in my life where I'm positioned to really represent what it means to be a champion and I can't wait to have that strap around my waist and hold it proudly and fight people that people expect me to fight and be a great champion.\"True to his nature of always seeking big fights (which includes a 2023 loss to Gervonta Davis that produced more than 1 million PPV buys), Garcia already has a target lined up next in his sights in the form of Shakur Stevenson, should he defeat Barrios. The 28-year-old Stevenson (25-0, 11 KOs) is just shy of three weeks removed from winning a title in a fourth weight division by widely outpoint Teofimo Lopez to capture the WBO belt at 140 pounds. Garcia was anything but impressed by Stevenson's performance and is confident that the two can meet next at a catchweight of 144 pounds (without the rehydration clause Davis used on Garcia). \n\"[Stevenson] controlled range really well and picked his shots. We give him credit for that but there was really nothing special for me that really catches my eye,\" Garcia said. \"He didn't really throw his left hand, he didn't finish [Lopez] off. You had a hurt little animal there that you could've just [finished] anytime you wanted but he played it safe every step of the way. That's just not how I fight. When I am beating someone up and they are pretty much done, you are going to see me take them out. \"That's just that simple but I've got that killer instinct. I guess you just have it or you don't and [Shakur] doesn't have it. So, when we step into that ring, he will feel the difference. That's who I want, for sure, sooner rather than later.\"Garcia, who will be cornered by his father Henry, has used the fallout of former trainer Joe Goossen joining forces for this fight with Barrios as an opportunity, including at the introductory press conference, to stir the pot and attempt to get inside Barrios' head. But separate from those type of theatrics, all signs have pointed to Garcia taking the fight very seriously because of how much he realizes a consecutive defeat would hurt his future options. \nNot only does Garcia believe he's the better fighter, he thinks the many wars Barrios has taken part in have slowly caught up with him. But regardless of the potential resistance applied by Barrios, Garcia has very much deemed this as a \"do or die moment\" for his career.    \"This is one of those moments or opportunities that I don't think I can get again, especially coming off of a loss. I feel like my back is against the wall, Garcia said. \"I'm just that guy. I'm just him. I don't think I'm a good guy or a bad guy, I think I'm just me. I'm competitive and I really want to win this bad, really bad. You are going to see a ferocious animal in the ring on Saturday night.\"\n            ",

Lavin was hired in 2022 after his second lengthy stint working as an on-air college hoops commentator, but he couldn't bring the program to consistency in the Gonzaga-dominated WCC. Lavin leaves USD with a 46-79 record. The program has not made the NCAAs since 2008 under Bill Grier.The 61-year-old Lavin has a 283-229 career record, including his time at UCLA from 2006-03 and St. John's from 2010-15.  Sources said San Diego athletic director Kimya Massey has reached out to a few prospective candidates for the job in recent weeks. The target may well wind up being a sitting high-major assistant. The job will take on some increased appeal moving forward, as Gonzaga's move out of the WCC to the reborn Pac-12 next season will open up opportunities for other programs to make inroads in what's expected to largely be a one-bid league moving forward.\nLavin will remain as coach until the end of the season.\n            \n",

    "body": "\nThe BYU Cougars haven't fared well against ranked opponents this season, losing five of six meetings -- including one with Arizona last month. The Wildcats improved to 5-0 vs. Top 25 teams with that victory but have lost their last two such contests.The Big 12 Conference rivals square off as ranked opponents again Wednesday as No. 23 BYU (19-6) visits McKale Center in Tucson to take on No. 4 Arizona (23-2) at 9 p.m. ET. While ranked first in the nation, the Wildcats withstood a late comeback attempt on Jan. 26 to defeat the then-No. 13 Cougars 86-83 on the road.Freshman Brayden Burries led all players with a season-high 29 points for Arizona, which has lost its last two game -- both against ranked teams. The Wildcats dropped an 82-78 decision to then-No. 9 Kansas on Feb. 9 and were edged 78-75 in overtime five days later by Texas Tech, which was 16th in the country at the time.Four of BYU's last five defeats were to ranked opponents, including a 77-66 setback against then No. 8 Houston on Feb. 7. That extended the Cougars' overall losing streak to four games, but they have righted the ship with back-to-back triumphs, against Baylor and Colorado.There are plenty of other contests on the college basketball schedule to keep fans satisfied until the NBA returns from its All-Star break on Thursday, including an SEC matchup between No. 20 Arkansas (19-6) and 25th-ranked Alabama (18-7) at 7 p.m. ET at the Coleman Coliseum in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The Crimson Tide enter with a four-game winning streak, while the Razorbacks have won three straight and six of their last seven.Arizona is a 12.5-point favorite against BYU in the latest consensus college basketball odds, while Alabama is a 4.5-point favorite versus Arkansas.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Feb. 18. All times EasternCBB best bets, where to watchNo. 20 Arkansas at No. 25 AlabamaTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Tuscaloosa, Ala. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Alabama -4.5 (-113) | Expert: Arkansas +4.5 (-110, Chip Patterson)The Crimson Tide have lost their last four games against ranked opponents, while the Razorbacks have won two of their last three such contests. However, Arkansas is just 4-3 on the road this season, and the last two setbacks were by double digits. Alabama has won three straight on its own court, where it posted a 14-point victory over South Carolina last Saturday. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the winning streak will continue with a comfortable triumph as the Crimson Tide cover the spread in 68% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Chip Patterson (7-4, +257 on his last 11 college basketball picks) disagrees, as he thinks its advantage inside and ability to limit second-chance opportunities will allow Arkansas to cover. No. 23 BYU at No. 4 ArizonaTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: BYU +12.5 (-109) | Expert: Arizona -6.5 First Half (-120, Thomas Casale)Only one of the Cougars' six defeats this season was by more than 11 points, and their setback against the Wildcats last month was by just three. AJ Dybantsa leads the nation in scoring with a 24.4-point average and recorded 24 in the loss to Arizona. The SportsLine Projection Model sees Dybantsa and the Cougars keeping it close against the Wildcats again, as its simulations have them covering the spread 63% of the time. Arizona owned a 13-point lead at halftime in the first meeting between these schools, and SportsLine expert Thomas Casale expects the Wildcats to get off to a strong start on their own court and enter the break with an advantage of more than six points.No. 17 St. John's at MarquetteTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Milwaukee, Wisc. | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 157.5 (-110) | Expert: St. John's -9.5 (-110, Jeff Hochman)The Red Storm are fifth in the Big East defensively, as they've allowed an average of 72.1 points this season. Only one of their last four opponents has recorded more than 72. Meanwhile, the Golden Eagles were limited to 59 and 57 points in their only meetings with ranked opponents this campaign and scored just 68 in a loss at St. John's last month. The Red Storm put up 92 in that contest, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't think this will be a high-scoring affair, as the Under hits in 67% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman (+290 on his last three against-the-spread picks involving Marquette) thinks St. John's will use its vastly superior rebounding skills to cover the spread.No. 8 Kansas at Oklahoma StateTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Stillwater, Okla. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Kansas -6.5 (-110) | Expert: Under 156.5 (-110, Mike McClure)The Jayhawks had their nine-game winning streak halted in embarrassing fashion last Saturday as they matched a season low with 56 points against then-No. 5 Iowa State. They'll be looking to take out their frustrations on the Cowboys, who have lost three in a row and allowed at least 84 points in four straight outings. Two of Oklahoma State's setbacks during its skid were by at least nine points, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees a comfortable victory for the Jayhawks on Wednesday as its simulations have them covering the spread 54% of the time. SportsLine expert Mike McClure doesn't believe a shootout will take place between these Big 12 rivals, as the Cowboys' offense isn't in the top 60 in the country and the Jayhawks are a strong defensive team.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Less than two weeks after winning Super Bowl 60, the Seattle Seahawks are up for sale. The estate of Paul G. Allen -- the former owner -- announced Wednesday that the process to find a new owner is underway.\n\"The Estate of Paul G. Allen today announced it has commenced a formal sale process for the Seattle Seahawks NFL franchise, consistent with Allen's directive to eventually sell his sports holdings and direct all Estate proceeds to philanthropy,\" the statement reads. \"The Estate has selected investment bank Allen & Company and law firm Latham & Watkins to lead the sale process, which is estimated to continue through the 2026 off-season. NFL owners must then ratify a final purchase agreement.\"The sale is expected to fetch a record-breaking price for an NFL franchise, topping the $6.05 billion the Washington Commanders sold for in 2023, per CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. ESPN has reported the team could sell for between $7 billion and $8 billion.The news of the sale comes just weeks after a spokesman for the ownership group disputed reports the team was for sale.\"We don't comment on rumors or speculation, and the team is not for sale,\" the spokesman said before the Super Bowl. \"We've already said that will change at some point per Paul's wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.\"\nThe Seahawks did indeed win the Super Bowl, defeating the New England Patriots 29-13 for their second title. This marks the first time an NFL team has gone up for sale in the wake of participating in a Super Bowl, much less winning it.The Seahawks and the Trail Blazers have been owned by the estate of Paul G. Allen since the former owner of both franchises died of cancer in 2018. His sister, Jody, has controlled the teams in the years since his death. The Allen estate reached an agreement to sell the Trail Blazers to Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon in August 2025.Allen, who co-founded Microsoft along with Bill Gates, officially bought the Seahawks from Ken Behring in 1997 for $200 million, a move that saved the franchise from a potential move to Southern California.\nThe Commanders' bidding process featured several prominent names, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, before Josh Harris ultimately won out. Bezos could be a factor in the Seahawks' sale as well, per Jones.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UCLA coach Mick Cronin added another couple of highlights to a growing reel of snappy remarks and antics on Tuesday night during and after the Bruins' 82-59 loss at No. 15 Michigan State. First, Cronin sent one of his own players to the locker room with 4:26 remaining following a flagrant 1 foul. Then, after the game, he got into a bizarrely terse exchange with a reporter over a benign question.Both situations underscored the angst surrounding UCLA basketball entering the season's stretch run. As a No. 10 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model, the Bruins have lost three of their past five games and are backing up to the cut line for the field of 68.Cronin is wearing the stress of another unspectacular season on his sleeve. The first situation arose with UCLA trailing 77-48 with under five minutes remaining, when Bruins reserve center Steven Jamerson II committed a hard foul on Michigan State's Carson Cooper as Cooper elevated for a transition dunk.\nThe foul was called a flagrant, but it was not a \"flagrant 2\" foul, which would warrant an ejection. Nonetheless, Cronin demonstrably ushered Jamerson into the locker room. Afterward, Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said, \"that's the first time I saw coach do it, but that sounds like Mick.\"Odd media exchangeCronin's next act after booting Jamerson was to snap at a reporter who was attempting to ask Cronin about chants from Michigan State's student section directed at UCLA center and former Spartans center Xavier Booker.\n\"I could give a rat's ass about the other the other team's student section,\" Cronin said.But that wasn't the end of it.\n\"I would like to give you a kudos for the worst question I've ever been asked,\" Cronin continued. \"You really think I care about the other team's student section?\"Cronin, who is in his seventh season coaching the Bruins, kept going from there.  \"Are you raising your voice at me?\" he asked the reporter.\"\nMick Cronin's reputation Rants, humorous comments, bluntness and the outward expression of frustration from Cronin are nothing new. Last season, he ripped his players as \"soft\" and \"delusional\" during a January low point of a 23-11 season.He regularly lambasts the Big Ten for UCLA's schedule, which features a handful of cross-country trips each year and the inevitable logistical challenges that come with it.One of his headline-grabbing remarks from last week was that he wants to find the \"biggest, nastiest, vodka-drinking Eastern European\" for his team.\nViewed in a certain light, Cronin is a funny character who is unafraid to speak his mind. But for UCLA fans growing fatigued of diminishing on-court returns, it might get old.UCLA's stretch runUCLA returns home to host No. 10 Illinois on Saturday as it enters a pivotal stretch of basketball for its NCAA Tournament hopes. The Bruins (17-9, 9-6 Big Ten) began the season ranked No. 12 in the preseason AP poll but came away from nonconference play with no significant victories.The Bruins' only win over a team expected to make the NCAA Tournament field as an at-large team came Jan. 20 against Purdue. But things started to get dicey on Jan. 31 with a 98-97 double-overtime home loss against Indiana.\nCronin was pointed in his postgame assessment following the IU loss, saying \"our defense was awful all night\" and calling out his team for \"pouting.\"Still, UCLA began its two-game road swing through the Big Ten's pair of Michigan programs at 17-7 (9-4) and with a little bit of breathing room on the bubble.After back-to-back losses to Michigan and Michigan State by 30 and 23 points, respectively, that breathing room is evaporating quick, and Cronin appears to know it.\n            ",

Dacoda Jones, the mother of Rice's two children, filed the civil suit in Dallas County (Texas) District Court and seeks $1 million in damages.Jones said in the lawsuit, filed on Monday, that Rice assaulted her over the course of many months from December 2023 through July 2025 and caused severe and permanent injuries.The lawsuit states that Rice strangled Jones at their shared home in Victory Park, Texas, in December 2023 and continued to assault her over the course of their relationship. Many of his alleged acts occurred while Jones was pregnant. In addition to the physical assault, Rice is also accused of abusive behaviors including throwing objects, destroying property and locking Jones out of their home in the middle of the night.Rice responded to the lawsuit via his legal representation.\"On October 9th, 2025, well after the parties' relationship had ended, Ms. Jones stated under penalty of perjury in a sworn Affidavit for Non-Prosecution that 'Mr. Rice and I had a verbal argument, but he did not punch me.' We will allow the legal process to run its course and have no further comment at this time,\" Rice's attorney, Sean Lindsey, said in a statement to ESPN.\nThe Chiefs also issued a statement after the lawsuit was filed.\"The club is aware and remains in communication with the National Football League,\" the team said.Jones did not refer to Rice by name when she brought forth the domestic violence allegations in January. She posted photos to Instagram of herself with a bloody lip and scratches and bruises on her face and body. She accused an unnamed partner of physical abuse, said the couple broke up in late 2025 and mentioned that the former partner locked her outside in freezing weather.\"I'm so tired of keeping quiet I'm so tired of protecting his image,\" Jones said in the since-deleted social media post. \"I've been through enough in the span of 8 years and I've had ENOUGH! I've dealt with abuse for years, me and this man decided to break up a couple months ago and it's been nothing but hell.\n\"He literally left us in Kansas and I had to beg him to send money so that I could drive to Texas with my kids and all our stuff. We have an agreement because of everything he's put me through and he still doesn't follow it. He's now trying to remove me and my kids from our home for no apparent reason. I've known this man for YEARS. He tries to put on this persona like he's dad of the year. He does the bare minimum and I have to beg for that. I've protected his image too long and I'm done doing that. It's time to protect my peace, protect my children and stand up for myself.\"Off-the-field storylines have now followed Rice in each of the last three offseasons. Last summer, the NFL suspended him for the first six games of the 2025 campaign for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The suspension was a result of a traffic incident that occurred in March 2024. Rice pleaded guilty to two felony charges in a hit-and-run and was sentenced to 30 days of jail time and five years of probation.Rice hauled in 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns across eight games last season after serving his suspension. The former second-round NFL Draft pick is entering the final year of his rookie contract with Kansas City.\n            ",

Anyone following its college basketball betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Wednesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookAlabama (-4.5) vs. Arkansas (-108)BYU (+11.5) vs. Arizona (-110)St. John's (-9.5) vs. Marquette (-105)Combining the three picks into a Wednesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +617 (risk $100 to win $617). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nAlabama (-4.5) vs. Arkansas (-108)Alabama enters on a four-game winning streak, and the Crimson Tide are 9-3 at home this season as they prepare to host Arkansas. The Crimson Tide have won five straight against Arkansas, and haven't lost on their home floor to Arkansas since 2019. Sophomore guard Labaron Philon Jr. is 13th in the nation in scoring at 21.3 points per game, with junior guard Aden Holloway adding 17 ppg this season. Meanwhile, Arkansas is 0-2 on the road against ranked teams this season. The model projects Alabama to cover in 65% of simulations. Back Alabama to cover at DraftKings here:BYU (+11.5) vs. Arizona (-110)Arizona has dropped back-to-back games, falling from No. 1 to No. 4 in the nation in the most recent polls. Arizona defeated BYU, 86-63, on the road on Jan. 26, which began a four-game losing streak for the Cougars. But BYU has rebounded with back-to-back wins. Both teams feature star freshmen in this matchup, but BYU has the projected top prospect between the two teams in AJ Dybantsa, who could be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Dybantsa leads the nation at 24.4 ppg, including scoring at least 28 points in three of his last four games. Despite shooting just 25% from the field in their first matchup, Dybantsa had 24 points against Arizona last time, and the model expects a more efficient performance from the star freshman and views 11.5 points as simply too high given how competitive their first meeting was. Arizona star freshman forward Koa Peat (leg) is out. The model projects BYU to cover in 67% of simulations. Back BYU to cover at DraftKings here:St. John's (-9.5) vs. Marquette\"St. John's holds several key advantages, including experience, but rebounding is the true difference-maker,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"Rick Pitino's squad ranks among the nation's elite in offensive rebounding, recovering over 37% of their missed shots. Marquette sits near the bottom of the Big East in defensive rebounding—a recurring weakness. In their last matchup just a month ago, St. John's dominated the glass and turned that hustle into a commanding 92–68 victory, fueled by a huge advantage in second-chance points. On average, St. John's is statistically more likely to recover its own misses than Marquette is to secure the rebound. This edge can generate 12–15 additional scoring chances per game, equating to 14–18 points—enough to swing the outcome and cover this spread again.\" Back St. John's to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

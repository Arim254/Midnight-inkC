    "body": "\n        Two playoff teams from last season meet up in Week 9 action as the Houston Texans host the Denver Broncos. Houston got off to a slow start to the year, especially on offense, and finds itself 3-4 entering this matchup with the Broncos. Denver is 6-2, good for first place in a loaded AFC West, thanks to a five-game win streak that includes three one-score victories. Kickoff from NRG Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET, and the Texans are 1.5-point favorites, according to the latest Broncos vs. Texans odds. The over/under for total points scored is 40.5. The Texans are -133 money line favorites (risk $133 to win $100), while the Broncos are +112 underdogs (wager $100 to win $112).

Houston's offense has been better of late, scoring 26 or more points in three of its last four games, but combine an inconsistent offense with one of the best defenses in the NFL, and you get the recipe for a lot of Unders. Denver has also leaned towards the Under this year, with that side hitting in five of eight games. The Broncos had arguably the best defense in the league last year, and while that unit isn't quite as dominant, it still ranks in the top five of yards and points allowed per game. Click here to bet Broncos vs. Texans at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Broncos vs. Texans SGPUnder 40.5 (-105, DraftKings)Broncos +1.5 (-108, DraftKings)J.K.

With a 12-game NFL slate on Sunday, there are plenty of opportunities to secure that bonus money. The Kansas City Chiefs will visit the Buffalo Bills at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday. The Chiefs ended Buffalo's season in a 32-29 final in last year's AFC Championship Game, but before then, the Bills defeated the Chiefs, 30-21, in Buffalo in a regular-season contest. The SportsLine model expects the Bills to protect their home field for a victory, despite being +112 underdogs, as one of its Sunday NFL best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook.The model also expects the Bears to rebound from their 30-16 loss to the Ravens last week to cover as 2.5-point favorites against the Bengals at 1 p.m. ET.

Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and it enters Week 10 on a profitable 47-33 combined run on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024.

But Chicago lost to a Tyler Huntley-led Ravens team, 30-16. Still, the Bears are off to a 4-3 start and rank 15th in scoring at 24 ppg. However, playing the Bengals' defense has a way of bringing the best out of an opposing offense, with Cincinnati allowing 31.6 ppg this season, the most in the NFL. The Jets recorded their first win of the season last week against the Bengals in a 39-38 final, and the model projects the Bears to cover in 57% of simulations. Bet on the NFL at FanDuel Sportsbook:Bills (+112) to defeat the ChiefsThe Bills are 11-1 at home since the beginning of last season, including a 30-21 victory over the Chiefs. Josh Allen is 4-1 in regular-season games against Patrick Mahomes in his career and is coming off winning his first NFL MVP last season. The Bills (5-2) scored 40 points last week against Carolina to combat any negative talk of entering the bye week off back-to-back losses. The Chiefs are 5-3 this season, but they've won only one game away from Arrowhead Stadium this season, which has the model leaning Buffalo's direction. Despite being the underdog, the model projects the Bills to win in 55% of simulations. Bet on the NFL at FanDuel Sportsbook:Seahawks vs. Commanders: Under 48.5 pointsThe Seahawks are one of the most run-heavy teams in the NFL, which can lead to Unders cashing with the clock running more often and from extended drives. Seattle runs on 49.63% of plays, which is the second-highest rate in the NFL. The Seahawks run that often despite having the second-fewest yards per rush (3.7), which again contributes to longer drives and less time of possession for the opposing team. The Under has hit in three of Washington's last four games, and three of the last four Seattle games had a total points Under 47.5. The Commanders will be without WR1 Terry McLaurin, who re-aggravated his quad injury. Jayden Daniels could be rusty with his arm and limited on the ground after missing last week with a hamstring injury, leading the model to project the Under to hit in 55% of simulations on Sunday Night Football. Bet on the NFL at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more NFL Week 9 picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Sunday.

The QB has a 71.2% completion percentage and a 13-3 TD-INT ratio while the RB1 leads the NFL with 850 yards on 143 carries and 12 rushing touchdowns. One of the Colts' few flaws is that the passing defense is allowing 252.0 yards per game, which could open the door for Rodgers to connect with DK Metcalf and rebound from last Sunday night's loss.  Rodgers completed 24 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns against the Packers. He didn't play as well as Jordan Love, however, who lit up the Pittsburgh defense for 360 yards and three touchdowns. The Steelers passing defense is allowing a league-worst 273.3 yards per game and is about to go up against a surging quarterback in Jones. The run defense was able to limit Josh Jacobs to 2.5 average yards on 13 carries, so their best course of action in Week 9 will be to limit the damage Taylor can do.Click here to bet Colts vs. Steelers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Colts vs. Steelers score prediction, picksIndianapolis is a league-leading 6-2-0 ATS this season while Pittsburgh is 3-4-0 ATS, although the SportsLine model foresees a rebound performance from Rodgers and the Steelers.

Bijan Robinson was held to just 25 yards in that game and will now go up against a Patriots run defense that only allows 76.0 yards per game. Atlanta has still held opposing QBs to a league-low 149.1 yards per game but will have their work cut out for them against a surging New England offense.   Maye put his league-leading completion percentage (75.2%) to the test against a tough Browns defense and came away with 282 passing yards and three touchdowns. Third-year receiver Kayshon Boutte now has at least one touchdown catch in three straight games and Stefon Diggs tallied his first TD of the season against the Browns. The defense has been solid overall and is only allowing 18.3 points per game. Plus, the Patriots have cleaned up since a mistake-heavy loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 3 and now enter Week 9 with a plus-two turnover ratio.Click here to bet Falcons vs. Patriots at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Falcons vs. Patriots score prediction, picksNew England is 6-2-0 ATS and has covered in five straight while Atlanta is 3-4-0 ATS and has failed to cover the spread in two straight.

The Packers also rank fifth in the NFL in scoring and have scored at least 27 points in six of the seven games they've played this season while the Panthers have allowed at least 24 points in six of eight outings.

But that was against the defense with the worst pressure rate in the league that was down its top two edge rushers. This is against a Denver defense with the best pressure rate in the league, and I expect them to have a lot of success against the Houston offensive line to help overcome the Patrick Surtain injury,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The question is what will the Broncos do offensively in a tough matchup, but I like catching points in a low-total game like this where I have no confidence in the offense that's favored.\"Bet Houston vs. Denver at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager and three months of NBA League Pass free:Game: Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Indianapolis Colts (1 p.m. ET)The Pick: Steelers +3.5 (-111)\"I feel this is a clear 'buy low, sell high' spot. Indy's historically efficient offense has benefited from playing all but one of their games in a dome stadium. They have also beaten up on weak teams, boasting wins over the Titans (twice), Dolphins, Cardinals and Raiders,\" SportsLine NFL expert Daniel Vithlani said. \"The Steelers just have too much talent on defense to be playing this poorly, and I expect a max effort performance at home. Playing outdoors on the road, I think we could see some Daniel Jones regression here. As an underdog of 3 or more, Steelers HC Mike Tomlin is 40-21-3 ATS, and 11-2-3 ATS at home in that spot, making him the most profitable coach of all-time when catching a field goal+ on the spread.\"Bet Pittsburgh vs. Indianapolis at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the promo code CBS20X:More NFL best betsEvery Week 9 NFL game simulated 10,000 timesWeek 9 NFL longshot parlay returns almost $18K on a $10 wager\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of AFC division leaders headline the NFL Week 9 schedule when the Indianapolis Colts take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. The Colts, behind running back Jonathan Taylor and quarterback Daniel Jones, have taken command of the AFC South at 7-1. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is in control of the AFC North at 4-3, but have dropped two in a row. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is coming off a disappointing performance in a loss to the Green Bay Packers, a team he spent 18 years with. Indianapolis enters as a 3.5-point favorite and is one of seven road favorites during the Week 9 NFL schedule, with the Chargers (-9.5 at Tennessee) being the biggest. Another matchup involving contenders sees the Kansas City Chiefs (4-3) visiting the Buffalo Bills (5-2). The Chiefs are 2-point favorites as former MVP quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen square off for the 10th time, with Mahomes holding a 5-4 edge. However, Buffalo has won four straight regular season meetings with Kansas City. The only game with a slimmer spread than Chiefs vs. Bills is Texans vs. Broncos (+1.5).

    "body": "\n        Perhaps to the surprise of some, the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, who are both 6-2 and atop their respective divisions with second-year quarterbacks at the helm, enter Week 9 with the longest active winning streaks in the NFL. During New England's winning streak, they've held all five opponents to 20 points or less while averaging nearly 31 points per game. For the Broncos, it's been a different story having trailed at some point during all five wins. This week, the Patriots are 5.5-point favorites against the Falcons, as New England has also covered in five straight. Meanwhile, the Broncos are 1.5-point underdogs at Houston in a game where the over/under is just 40.5, as a pair of top-five scoring defenses go head-to-head.

Pittsburgh enters off two straight losses where they have surrendered more than 30 points, while Indianapolis has won four straight contests, having scored 31 points or more in each game.\"Pittsburgh's defense has looked awful in their last two games against Cincinnati and Green Bay, so how could they possibly fare that much better against the league's highest scoring team? Football, especially in the NFL, is a funny game. This Week 9 home contest is a must for the Steelers who need to build up as much ground as they can between themselves and the soon-to-be-charging Ravens. Indianapolis is currently the frontrunner for the AFC's No. 1 seed, but that can't last too much longer, right? It seems like the fairy tell has to come to an end at some point.

    "body": "\n        TORONTO -- As baseball would have it, the fate of the Dodgers' season -- and their place in history -- took the form of a ground ball headed for Mookie Betts. Of course it was Betts. Five years ago, the Dodgers started this run after luring him away from Boston and signing him to the second-largest contract ever at the time. After losing back-to-back World Series in 2017 and 2019, Hollywood's team committed to buying a trophy. Betts was the foundational piece. The cornerstone of the Dodgers' championship splurge. They paid for his talent, for his championship pedigree. And the six-time Gold Glove right fielder was so versatile in his capacity that he moved to shortstop this season.The ball found him. Betts stepped on second and fired to Freddie Freeman -- another star who followed Betts to L.A. earlier this decade -- for the final two outs of one of the best World Series games ever. Dodgers 5, Blue Jays 4 in 11 thrilling Game 7 innings. The Dodgers' third title in six tries.  A fitting punctuation for sports' latest dynasty. \"Honestly, nobody knows, because they weren't in my head, but I was so nervous,\" Betts said. \"I've never been in that situation. And I was so nervous, and I literally, as he was pitching the ball, I was talking to myself, saying, 'Be nasty, Mook. Just make a play. Be nasty. Be nasty.'\" \nMoney spent doesn't guarantee titles. But in the intensity of Game 7, with the stakes of the World Series at center table, and the magic of the underdog Blue Jays threatening to doom their dynastic bid, the Dodgers' embarrassment of riches flexed. They leaned on it hard, pressed every ounce of expertise they expensed.Will Smith, the $140 million catcher, hit the go-ahead home run in the 11th. Yoshinobu Yamamoto, baseball's only $325 million pitcher, got the win in relief -- a day after getting the win as a starter. And Betts, the $365 superstar, sealed it by scooping up the grounder, stepping on second and firing a laser to Freeman, the $160 million first baseman.Money well spent. \"We've put together something pretty special, I do know that,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"I'm proud of the players for the fans, scouting, player development, all the stuff. To do what we've done in this span of time is pretty remarkable. I guess let the pundits and all the fans talk about if it's a dynasty or not, but I'm pretty happy with where we're at.\" \nIt took everything the Dodgers had to outlast the Blue Jays. But even the destiny that seemed to push Toronto ran out of gas. The fervor of Canada, the spirit of Joe Carter, the hunger of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., couldn't match the depths of Dodger excellence. Los Angeles was too talented, too experienced, too layered.Winning a championship is hard. Repeating in baseball is even harder. The last team to pull it off was the 2000 Yankees, carried by stars in their own right. Derek Jeter among them, who watched the Dodgers celebrate firsthand Saturday night.Dynasties don't come in shiny suits. Oftentimes, they appear in battered form, pushed to the limit. Worn. Bloodied. The Dodgers wore that crown. Proudly. They got punched by a Bo Bichette three-run homer that sent the Rogers Centre into a frenzy. But Los Angeles responded. When Toronto punched again, when Andrés Giménez laced an RBI double to right-center field, it was Max Muncy who counterpunched. He launched a homer off Trey Yesavage in the eighth to pull the club within one.\nThen in the ninth inning, the tides turned. For all the money spent on the big names, like Shohei Ohtani and Blake Snell, just as important to a dynasty are players like Miguel Rojas, a veteran glue who helps keep his team grounded. That's the genius of the Dodgers empire. Yeah, they have deep pockets. And they use them to acquire everything necessary to win. The superstars and the superglues.Down to their last two outs, Rojas took a Jeff Hoffman hanging slider, hooking it for a game-tying solo shot in the top of the ninth. \nThen in the bottom half, the defensive play of the night -- even better than Betts' game-ending double play -- was the game-saving catch by Pages. In a gesture of the Dodgers' never-ending options, he came in for defense. When a sac fly would win it for Toronto, manager Dave Roberts needed a strong arm for a potential throw to the plate. Pages entered the game with one out. One batter later, Pages displayed his glove, tracking down a deep fly ball and running over his teammate Kiké Hernandez to snare it. Crisis averted.\n\"They get the three-run bomb early and the roof exploded off this place,\" Muncy said. \"Loudest place I think I've ever been. As a hitting group, we kind of met and talked about what we talked about in Philly -- there's going to be a moment where it gets extremely loud. But it's going to be extremely silent when we're on top at the end.\" \n        \n            \n                Ranking seven craziest moments from Dodgers' unforgettable World Series Game 7 win vs. Blue Jays\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd it was. Yamamoto was the hero, worthy of a World Series MVP, tossing 2 ⅔ scoreless frames to close it. This was one night after a six-inning outing in Game 6 where he threw 96 pitches. This is how dynasties are molded. Through shared experience. Through resolve. Through the pain showing up as product, not just promise. Enduring even when the road isn't the swiftest.\n\"In baseball, three titles in six years is a dynasty,\" Dodgers minority owner Magic Johnson said. \"It's not like we've been doing it for a long time, but in a short period of time to have three World Series. And to win back-to-back, because it's so hard in baseball to do that, that's why I'm saying it. It's so difficult in baseball to achieve what we just achieved.\" Achievement spilled into the batting cage, where champagne and beer became the spokesmen for success. Ohtani and Yamamoto were the first to emerge in the clubhouse, washing away what had felt so heavy for so long. The $1.025 billion the Dodgers spent on them comes with responsibility. They both fulfilled them during this postseason to help push their team to a Game 7 and into the history books. Freeman, to the right of the pair, noted that the expectations will grow more. No team has three-peated since Jeter's Yankees. That's now the standard. The blueprint they will try to measure. \nBetts, meanwhile, embraced his family. Sheer joy that was hard for him to find this season. He's the linchpin. The common denominator of what this organization has become. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final day of the 2025 NWSL regular season arrives with only some of the playoff picture in view. First-place Kansas City Current and second-place Washington Spirit are locked into the quarterfinal rounds as the top seeds, and only one playoff spot remains up for grabs between Racing Louisville FC and North Carolina Courage. Other teams will compete for table positioning and for the honor to host a home playoff game. The drama shifts to a battle for the remaining playoff seeding on Sunday. Decision Day will help settle the final standings from third to eighth place, and a central clash between Seattle Reign FC and Orlando Pride will directly determine one of the top three seeds and send a ripple effect throughout the rest of the playoff pond. CBS is the official home of the NWSL Championship, and fans can watch select playoff matches across CBS platforms, including CBS Sports Golazo Network, CBS Sports Network, and Paramount+.Here's what's at stake on Sunday:NWSL Decision Day scheduleSunday, Nov. 2Kansas City Current vs. San Diego Wave | 3 p.m. | ESPN, Fubo (Try for free)Utah Royals vs. Washington Spiri | 5 p.m. | NWSL+Portland Thorns vs. Houston Dash | 5 p.m. | NWSL+Orlando Pride vs. Seattle Reign | 5 p.m. | NWSL+North Carolina Courage vs. Gotham FC  | 5 p.m. | ESPN, Fubo (Try for free)Racing Louisville vs. Bay FC | 5 p.m. | NWSL+Chicago Stars vs. Angel City | 5 p.m. | NWSL+\nA quick snapshotHere's who has already clinched and what is at stake:• Kansas City Current (No.1) and Washington Spirit (No.2) have already locked up their seeds and are the top two teams that will host playoff games.• Gotham FC, Orlando Pride, Portland Thorns FC, San Diego Wave FC, and Seattle Reign FC clinched playoff spots in Week 25. All five clubs have a shot at hosting a quarterfinal game.• Racing Louisville and North Carolina Courage are battling for the eighth seed and a playoff berth. The Courage can't finish above eighth place, but Racing could potentially finish higher.A third-place battleThe game between third-place Orlando Pride and fourth-place Seattle Reign is the most straightforward meeting of the day, with the No. 3 spot up for grabs. If Seattle beat the Pride at Orlando, then they would leapfrog the Pride and secure the No. 3 seed. If Orlando defeat the Reign, they will claim third place and the right to host a quarterfinal match.A draw would just add to the chaos. A draw for Orlando could clinch either the No. 3 or No. 4 seed with a San Diego draw/loss or a Portland draw/loss. A draw for Seattle would leave them vulnerable to being overtaken by other contenders, and so would a loss.\nSeattle scenarios for a draw or loss against Orlando Pride:Clinch No. 4 seed with a draw and San Diego draw/loss and Portland draw/loss and Gotham draw/lossClinch No. 4 seed with a loss and San Diego loss and Portland loss and a Gotham draw/lossThe scenarios make the matchup between Seattle and Orlando a critical game for both sides and others across the league. The game also comes after the revelation by Reign head coach Laura Harvey that she utilized ChatGPT out of curiosity earlier this season to test the tech on its NWSL formational knowledge. The AI software suggested the club play in a five-back, which the Reign studied, trained for, and executed for the first time against Orlando Pride earlier this year. Who already clinched playoffs?Kansas City Current – No. 1 seed / NWSL Shield winnerWashington Spirit – No. 2 seedOrlando Pride – Clinched Week 24Seattle Reign FC – Clinched Week 25San Diego Wave FC – Clinched Week 25Gotham FC – Clinched Week 25Portland Thorns FC – Clinched Week 25TBD (only Racing Louisville and North Carolina Courage in contention)Who is eliminated?Several teams are already eliminated from playoff contention.

    "body": "\n        Three rookie running backs who have been Fantasy football start/sit decisions all year made huge impacts on Sunday. RJ Harvey scored three touchdowns, Woody Marks went over 100 scrimmage yards and TreVeyon Henderson had a career-high of 75 total yards. Their Week 9 Fantasy football rankings likely received a boost, compared to the week prior, but does that warrant any of them a spot in Week 9 Fantasy football lineups ahead of more established veterans like Nick Chubb, Aaron Jones or Tony Pollard?Speaking of rookie ball carriers, Cam Skattebo is no longer an option as a Fantasy football pick after dislocating his ankle. Tyrone Tracy Jr. is seemingly the next man up in New York, but what do the Week 9 Fantasy football projections forecast for veteran Devin Singletary? Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) has been ruled out, meaning more carries for Kareem Hunt, while Brashard Smith may have a bigger role.

Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 9 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 9: The model is fading Bengals receiver Tee Higgins, a two-time 1,000-yard wideout who has touchdowns in three of his last four games. However, Higgins hasn't been quite as productive, as a whole, as he's been in previous years. He's averaging career lows in both yards per game (45) and receptions per game (3.1), thus making his reliance on touchdowns a risky proposition for his Fantasy owners. He has an over/under of 52.5 receiving yards in this one. Higgins' touchdown reception in his last game was his lone catch of the game and now has to face a Chicago defense, whose strength is versus the pass. The Bears are allowing just 9.4 receptions per game to opposing wide receivers, which is the second-fewest in the league. Chicago hasn't allowed a single wideout to reach 100 yards since Week 2, and only one receiver has more than five catches over that span. Sitting outside the top 25 in Week 9 Fantasy football WR rankings, Higgins may not warrant a spot in Fantasy football lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Chargers tight end Oronde Gadsden II. The fifth-round rookie has made a name for himself over the last three weeks and ranks second amongst tight ends in Fantasy points over this stretch. He had a 5-77-1 stat line last Thursday, which followed seven receptions for 164 yards and a score in his previous outing. Gadsden has started just two games this year but still has as many redzone receptions (four) as Chargers wideouts Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston.He now gets a dream matchup versus the Titans, who rank 29th in points allowed and 26th in yards allowed, and just saw their thin secondary further decimated by trading cornerback Roger McCreary to the Rams. Tennessee has given up at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown to tight ends in each of the last three weeks. Gadsden wasn't on the Fantasy radar a few weeks ago but now finds himself among the top five in positional rankings for this week, making him a must-start for Week 9 Fantasy football lineups.

    "body": "\n        This has not been the rookie season many expected from Ashton Jeanty after he was the No. 6 overall pick by the Las Vegas Raiders in the 2025 NFL Draft. The Raiders are coming off their bye, though, after being shut out by the Chiefs, and that additional time to prepare for a matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars could lead to better offensive success. The rookie has five of the Raiders' 10 touchdowns this season, and the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has Jeanty among its top picks for Week 9 anytime TD scorer bets at +105 odds at online sports betting sites. Jeanty and the Raiders are three-point underdogs, and his over/under for total rushing attempts is 15.5. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Josh Jacobs to remain on a roll for the Green Bay Packers, and Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze to cash for Week 9 anytime TD scorer bets. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 9 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 9 NFL picks. It can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest bet365 bonus code, where new users receive $200 in bonus bets with a $5 wager, whether it wins or loses.Best Week 9 NFL anytime touchdown picks:Josh Jacobs, Packers (-145)Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+105)Rome Odunze, Bears (+125)Parlay these picks for +625 odds with a DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5 or more wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free: (odds subject to change)Josh Jacobs, Packers (-145) Jacobs has scored a touchdown in six of seven games this season, including in each of the last four contests. The Packers RB1 has seven touchdowns over his last four games, with three different two-touchdown performances. He's second in the NFL with nine rushing touchdowns entering a contest against the Panthers, who allowed 216 yards and two touchdowns to Buffalo running back James Cook last week. The Panthers are allowing 4.6 yards per rush, which ranks 24th in the NFL, and even at -145 odds, the model sees strong value in Jacobs scoring a touchdown, which he does in 80% of simulations.Click here to bet on Jacobs as a Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer at DraftKings, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+105)The Raiders' rookie has scored half of Las Vegas' touchdowns this season (five), with three rushing and two receiving scores. Las Vegas was shut out by the Chiefs in its last game, but the Raiders are coming off a bye, and that additional time between games could lead to a more successful game plan. Jeanty has four touchdowns over his last four games, and he's played more than 60% of snaps in four of his last fives games as he grasps a better concept of being an NFL running back and the Raiders' offense. The Raiders play the Jaguars, who are coming off a 35-7 loss to the Rams in Week 7, and the model projects Jeanty to score in 70% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 48.78%. Click here to bet on Jeanty as a Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Rome Odunze, Bears (+125)Odunze was a touchdown-scoring machine to begin the season, scoring at least once in each of the first four games of the year. He's gone scoreless over his last three weeks, though, but he remains a featured part of the offense, averaging seven targets per game over that span. The No. 9 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft had seven receptions for 114 yards on 10 targets last week against the Ravens, and he's been Chicago's leading receiver in three of seven games this season. Starting running back D'Andre Swift (groin) is out, which could lead to more passing against the Bengals, who have the worst scoring defense in the NFL. The Bengals are allowing 31.6 ppg, including 39 points to the previously winless Jets last week. The model projects Odunze to score in 64% of simulations, returning strong value at +125 odds. Click here to bet on Odunze as a Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Want more Week 9 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 9.

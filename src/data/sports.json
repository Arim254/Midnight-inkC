Here's a look at why Valdez may be lingering on the market and here now are Wednesday's hot stove rumors.    Pirates interested in Ozuna, Valdez  \nAfter missing out on Eugenio Suárez, the Pirates have interest in free agents Marcell Ozuna and Framber Valdez, reports The Athletic. Pittsburgh has indicated a willingness to spend, though their projected 2026 payroll is only about $12 million higher than their 2025 payroll, per Cot's Baseball Contracts. The team's notable offseason additions are Brandon Lowe and Ryan O'Hearn.  The Pirates have a very strong rotation led by reigning Cy Young winner Paul Skenes. Signing Valdez would add to that strength. It would also open the possibility of trading another pitcher, perhaps Mitch Keller, for a bat. It's worth exhausting that possibility before settling for Ozuna, a DH-only player with declining power. The Pirates had baseball's lowest-scoring offense in 2025. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     Astros remain in the market for lefty bats The Astros are still looking to add left-handed hitters, GM Dana Brown told MLB.com.\"I would say we are definitely in the market for left-handed bats and  we're still continuing to be in that market. We're working hard every  day to see what we can add. If there was a left-handed bat that was  available, I would say that we are in on him,\" Brown said. \nHouston's only lefty bats are the great Yordan Alvarez, platoon outfielders Zach Cole and Jesús Sanchez, and backup catcher César Salazar. The Astros have been trying to trade Christian Walker since last year's trade deadline. Moving Walker and adding a lefty-hitting first base option would be ideal, though interest in Walker has been minimal. The outfield is another obvious spot to add.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks are trading Anthony Davis to the Washington Wizards for a package that includes Khris Middleton and two future first-round picks, according to ESPN. The Mavericks are also sending Jaden Hardy, D'Angelo Russell and Dante Exum to the Wizards in exchange for AJ Johnson, Malaki Branham and Marvin Bagley III, as well as three second-round picks.This ends what has been a tumultuous stint for Davis in Dallas. He landed with the Mavericks almost a year ago to the day on Feb. 1, 2025, after the Lakers deal that sent Luka Doncic to Los Angeles. A widely criticized deal, Davis never really got his footing in Dallas primarily because of consistent injuries.Davis is sidelined with ligament damage in his left hand that is expected to keep him out for several more weeks. Davis joins Trae Young in D.C.It's difficult to look at this deal in any other way than a total letdown for the Mavericks. And when you hold it up next to the Doncic trade, it looks even worse. Essentially, the Mavericks traded Doncic for Max Christie, Khris Middleton, AJ Johnson, Malaki Branham, Marvin Bagley II, the Lakers' 2029 first-round pick, the Thunder's 2026 first-round pick, the Warriors' 2030 first-round pick, the Suns' 2026 second-round pick, the Bulls' 2027 second-round pick and the Rockets' 2029 second-round pick.\nWhat a depressing haul. Even the two first-rounders the Mavericks got from the Wizards hold little to no value. One of them is a 2026 pick from the Thunder which will, in all likelihood, be the No. 30 selection. The other is a 2030 pick from the Warriors, and it's top-20 protected. If it doesn't convey, then it immediately becomes a second-round pick in the same draft.There is a silver lining in all of this, though. While the return is pretty awful, it allows the Mavericks to move on from the emotional baggage carried since Feb. 1, 2025 when they dealt Doncic to the Lakers. Davis -- unfortunately -- represented everything bad about that deal, and now that he's gone, Dallas doesn't have to kid itself about this whole \"two timeline approach\" that former general manager Nico Harrison was trying to sell the fans.The draft capital the Mavericks got in return for Davis isn't as pristine as it could be, but it's better than pretending like Davis was going to work at all. Now, they can fully focus on building around their prized rookie in Cooper Flagg. They'll have a high lottery pick in June in what's supposed to be one of the deepest drafts in recent memory. They also have the Thunder's first-round pick, which might be low, but it's a draft selection they wouldn't have otherwise.\nIt's a sad state of affairs for the Mavericks, but it's the necessary step this franchise needed to fully close the book on this chapter and look ahead to what should be an exciting era with Flagg in Dallas.For the Wizards, it's a solid move to see if Davis can return to his All-Star form. Pairing him with Young should create an ideal pick-and-roll tandem, something the NBA champion lacked in Dallas with Kyrie Irving tearing his ACL. Sliding him next to rising big man Alex Sarr in the frontcourt will give the 2024 No. 2 pick an ideal mentor to further his development.If Davis can stay healthy, which is never a guarantee, that trio of guys, as well as the stable of other young players on the team, is a team that could compete next season in a significantly weaker Eastern Conference.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Free agency ordinarily isn't the answer to an NFL team's prayers. Winning free agency doesn't instantly translate to success. Only four of the teams that spent the most money in free agency have made the playoffs in the same year over the last 10 seasons. The 2024 Tennessee Titans are a prime example of free agency futility. Spending the third most money in free agency resulted in a three-win decrease where the Titans secured the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft with a 3-14 record.Super Bowl LX will be an exception regarding free agency. Making the Super Bowl immediately after a big spending spree is a rarity. Both Super Bowl LX participants were among the biggest spenders in free agency during the offseason. Any signings after the cutoff date to qualify for the compensatory draft pick formula, which is the Monday after the NFL Draft, were excluded from calculations when determining spending. This date was April 28 for 2025. Players with expiring contracts headed to unrestricted free agency who re-signed were included in the computations.The New England Patriots easily spent the most in free agency. Armed with over $125 million in salary cap space, the Patriots were determined to improve upon the 4-13 record of the previous two seasons. The Patriots signed 16 players to contracts totaling $364.86 million with $200.559 million in guarantees, of which $181.659 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The contracts were worth as much as $407.355 million thanks to performance bonuses (incentives and salary escalators).\nThe primary emphasis was on defense. Six defensive starters were signed.Most notably, the Patriots won a bidding war with the Carolina Panthers for Milton Williams. The defensive tackle signed a four-year, $104 million contract with $63 million in guarantees ($51 million fully guaranteed at signing). The deal made Williams the NFL's third-highest paid interior defensive lineman at $26 million per year. This was one of the more surprising deals of free agency because Williams was a part of an interior defensive line rotation with the Philadelphia Eagles where his 47.8% defensive playtime in 2024 was a career high.Carlton Davis was signed to pair with Christian Gonzalez, a 2024 second-team All-Pro, at cornerback. He received a three-year, $54 million contract, averaging $18 million per year with $34.5 million fully guaranteed. The deal is worth as much as $60 million because of incentives.Edge rusher Harold Landry was brought in to bolster the pass rush. He was given a three-year, $43.5 million deal (worth up to $48 million through incentives) with $26 million fully guaranteed. K'Lavon Chaisson, Landry's edge-rushing counterpart, might be New England's best value signing. He received a one-year, $3 million deal worth up to $5 million through incentives. Chaisson's 7.5 sacks are second on the Patriots behind Landry's 8.5.\nLinebacker Robert Spillane signed a three-year, $33 million contract, averaging $11 million per year with $20.6 million fully guaranteed. Incentives make the maximum value of the deal $37.5 million.The expectations weren't high for safety Jaylinn Hawkins when he signed a one-year, $1.8 million contract. His emergence led to the Patriots trading Kyle Dugger to the Pittsburgh Steelers at the end of October.Linebacker Jack Gibbens and nose tackle Khyiris Tonga, who signed one year deals for $1.3 million and $2.1 million respectively, have been key contributors. Gibbens has been on the field for 48.23% of New England's defensive snaps while Tonga's defensive playtime was 33.1% during the regular season. \nThe Patriots took a calculated risk that wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who turned 32 in November, would bounce back from tearing the ACL in his right knee during the middle of 2024 season. Diggs signed a three-year, $63.5 million contract (worth a maximum of $69 million through incentives) with an extremely team-friendly structure in March a couple of weeks into free agency. The deal has $26 million in guarantees where $20 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Diggs didn't have any lingering effects from his knee injury. He caught 85 passes for 1,013 yards with four touchdowns.Diggs wasn't the only free agent addition at wide receiver. Mack Hollins was signed to a two-year, $8.4 million deal with additional $2 million in incentives. His 656 regular-season snaps were the most among Patriots wide receivers.Two starters on the offensive line were found. Right tackle Morgan Moses signed a three-year, $24 million contract worth a maximum of $28.5 million through incentives. Center Garrett Bradbury received a two-year deal with a base value of $9.5 million.\nHiring Mike Vrabel as head coach, quarterback Drake Maye taking a huge step forward in his second NFL season and the free agent acquisitions have been the catalyst in New England's turnaround. The 10-win improvement is the NFL's best for the 2025 season.The Seattle Seahawks didn't have as much ground to make up as the Patriots. The playoffs were just missed in 2024 with a 10-7 record. Nonetheless, the Seahawks were the NFL's fourth biggest spender in free agency by most accounts. Seattle signed 13 players for $247,927,500 with $133,542,500 in guarantees where $95,042,500 was fully guaranteed at signing. The maximum value of these contracts is $285,827,500 when including incentives and salary escalators.A big key to the Seahawks earning the top seed in the NFC for the playoffs with a 14-3 record was signing quarterback Sam Darnold. The Seahawks pivoted to Darnold after contract extensions talks with Geno Smith stalled prior to his trade to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2025 third round pick in March. \nDarnold signed a three-year, $100.5 million contract, averaging $33.5 million per year worth a maximum of $115.5 million through incentives during free agency. There are $55 million in guarantees, of which $37.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Smith would still be Seattle's quarterback if he had been willing to accept a Darnold-type deal.Darnold demonstrated that he wasn't just a product of Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell's offensive mind. He earned Pro Bowl honors for a second straight season. More importantly, Darnold has started changing his reputation of shrinking in big games. He completed 25 of 36 passes (69.4%) for 356 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions to post a 127.8 passer rating during Seattle's 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game.The Seahawks turned to the free agent market to address a need at wide receiver after trading DK Metcalf to the Steelers for the equivalent of a second-round pick and releasing Tyler Lockett. Cooper Kupp fit the bill. He signed a three-year, $45 million deal (worth a maximum of $47 million through salary escalators) with $26.5 million in guarantees a few days after the Rams released him.\nEdge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence left the Dallas Cowboys after 11 seasons because he was sure that he couldn't win a Super Bowl staying there. He signed a three-year, $32.5 million contract with $18 million in guarantees. Incentives and salary escalators make the deal worth as much as $41.5 million. Lawrence is the only player who had at least three forced fumbles and at least three fumble recoveries this season. He returned two of the recovered fumbles for touchdowns.The Seahawks made two important re-signings on the defensive side of the ball. Linebacker Ernest Jones signed a three-year, $28.5 million contract worth up to $33 million through incentives and salary escalators to return to the Seahawks. His five interceptions were tied for the most among linebackers this season. Jones was named a second-team All-Pro. Defensive tackle Jarran Reed remained in Seattle on a three-year, $22 million deal with an additional $3 million in incentives.The NFL is a copycat league. It will be interesting to see which teams that missed the playoffs will go on a spending spree when the free agent signing period opens on March 11. The Raiders, Titans and New York Jets, who each had 3-14 records this season, are expected to be among the teams with the most 2026 salary cap space. Super Bowl LX is the first time the two participants are in the game after missing the playoffs the previous year since the 2003 season when the Patriots beat the Panthers.\n            ",

The main haul in the trade was draft picks, so they are going to have a void in the scoring department moving forward,\" SportsLine expert Mike Barner said. \"The players they did acquire might not be available yet, which would leave the Grizzlies even more shorthanded. Although Ty Jerome has played limited minutes since returning from injury, he combined for at least 26 points and assists in both games. He could get a few extra minutes against a Kings team that has the third-worst defensive rating in the league, so this over is appealing.\" Back Jerome at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA betting picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Wednesday.

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- While the Chicago Bulls were sitting in their Milwaukee hotel Tuesday afternoon ahead of their game against the Bucks, they got the same notifications on their phones as everyone else. Two of their teammates -- Nikola Vučević and Kevin Huerter -- weren't their teammates anymore. First, it was reported that Huerter was heading to the Detroit Pistons as part of a three-team trade involving the Minnesota Timberwolves that will bring Jaden Ivey and Mike Conley to Chicago. A short time later, the report came out that Vučević was going to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Anfernee Simons. \"Tough day. It's part of the business, we're supposed to be robots about it I guess,\" Coby White said in the Bulls' locker room prior to the game. \"I'm trying to focus on the game, but obviously with a lot of stuff going on like this, it's hard not to think about,\" White continued. \"I've been with Vuc for a long time, so it's tough to see him go. It's tough to see Kev go. You try to focus on the game and be there for your teammates.\"\nAyo Dosunmu was also trying to wrap his head around the news. \"It's pretty crazy because you understand the circumstance, you understand that each and every year that's gonna happen, but then when it does happen it stings a little bit because you built a relationship with these guys and you pour so much into it with your teammates,\" Dosunmu said. There's a good chance the Bulls aren't done dealing. White himself could be on the move prior to Thursday's deadline as the Bulls chart a new path forward, though he said he \"obviously\" wants to stay in Chicago. As White and Co. wait to see what the next few days will bring, here's what they had to say about their former teammates and how Vučević and Huerter, whom White called \"ultimate professionals,\" can help their new squads. Vučević to the Celtics\nEven though Neemias Queta and Luka Garza have been better than expected this season, the Celtics have long been in the market for a frontcourt upgrade. Likewise, it's long been known that they were looking to shed money to ease their luxury-tax bill or possibly get out of the tax altogether. \nSwapping Simons, who has been excellent as of late, for Vučević kills two birds with one stone. Vučević gives the Boston frontcourt a new dimension and the Celtics cut $6 million in salary, which takes them below the first apron of the luxury tax and saves over $20 million tax penalties. Instead of taking a gap year, the 31-18 Celtics have been one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. Trading Simons for Vučević instead of just dumping his contract suggests that the front office is planning on another deep playoff run -- with or without Jayson Tatum, who may return from a torn Achilles later this season. \n        \n            \n                Anfernee Simons trade grades: Celtics earn 'B' for landing Bulls' Nikola Vučević\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's what the Bulls had to say about how Vučević will help the Celtics:Coach Billy Donovan:\"As the game has evolved and it is always kinda changing -- more 3s, faster pace -- he's always adjusted, which I really respected, really appreciated. He was always available, he played a lot of games, he was always available in a league where guys get hurt and aren't able to play, he found a way to always get himself ready to play. He was reliable. He was one of the first guys in there every day, took care of his body. Even last night, we land, go to the hotel, I go down to the weight room and he's already running on the treadmill. He's just that kind of professional. I think it's good for some of the young guys to see how he prepares himself and gets himself ready to play.\"\nWhite:\"Ultimate pro, was an All-Star in this league. His versatility as a 5 to play inside and out, knock down big shots in big moments.\"Dosunmu:\"With Vuc you're getting a seasoned, veteran big, an All-Star who can shoot it, pass it, knows the game, competitor.\"Huerter to the Pistons\nThe Pistons have been one of the best stories in the league. After making the playoffs last season for the first time since 2019, they've taken another big leap and have a 5 ½-game lead over the New York Knicks and Boston Celtics for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. \nAs great as the Pistons have been, there are still questions about their ability to actually win the East and compete for a title -- in part due to their youth and in part due to their poor 3-point shooting. The Pistons are 28th in the league in 3-point attempts per game (31.8) and 21st in 3-point percentage (34.8%). Over the last decade, the 2020 Los Angeles Lakers in the bubble are the only team to win a title while being in the bottom-third of the league in both of those categories. It's no surprise that they went out to try and find some shooting help, but it is a bit of a surprise that Huerter was their choice. While Huerter was an strong shooter early in his career, his shot has deserted him in recent years. In 44 appearances this season, he's shooting a career-worst 31.4% on 5.1 3-point attempts per game. If teams treat Huerter as more of an outside threat than Ivey, though, that will give the Pistons the spacing benefit. Here's what the Bulls had to say about how Huerter will help the Pistons:\"I really had a lot of respect and admiration for Kevin when he was in Atlanta,\" Donovan said. \"Before he got here I admired his IQ, his feel for the game, he's got good size, he's a lot more athletic than you realize. His shooting this year has been up and down, but for the most part for his career he's been about a 36, 37% 3-point shooter. Total team guy, another guy that's got a really savvy basketball IQ.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nLeft-hander Mickey Lolich, one of the greatest pitchers in Detroit Tigers history, has died, the team announced Wednesday. He was 85.\nLolich is best remembered for his legendary performance against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1968 World Series. He made three starts in the series, threw three complete games, and outdueled Hall of Famer Bob Gibson on two days' rest in Game 7. Lolich finished with a 1.67 ERA in the series and also hit his only career home run in Game 2. He was named World Series MVP.Born and raised in Oregon, Lolich signed with the Tigers as an amateur free agent in 1958 and spent parts of five seasons in the minor leagues before making his major-league debut on May 12, 1963. He was a full-time member of the rotation the following year. By 1967, Lolich had emerged as one of the game's top starting pitchers.From 1967-72, Lolich pitched to a 3.07 ERA and averaged 37 starts and 280 innings per year. He's a three-time All-Star who finished second to Vida Blue in the 1971 Cy Young voting and third behind Gaylord Perry and Wilbur Wood in 1972. Lolich finished fifth in the MVP voting in 1971 and tenth in 1972.The Tigers traded Lolich to the New York Mets in a four-player trade that sent Rusty Staub to Detroit following the 1975 season. Lolich spent one year with the Mets, sat out 1977 and opened a restaurant in Michigan, then returned to baseball in 1978. He finished his career with the San Diego Padres at age 39 in 1979.A natural born right-hander, Lolich learned to pitch left-handed after breaking his right arm in a childhood accident. He was baseball's all-time strikeout leader among left-handed pitchers at the time of his retirement. He still ranks fifth all-time:Randy Johnson: 4,875Steve Carlton: 4,136CC Sabathia: 3,093Clayton Kershaw: 3,052Mickey Lolich: 2,832Carlton, Johnson, and Sabathia are all in the Hall of Fame, and Kershaw will be a first-ballot entry once eligible. Lolich spent the then-maximum 15 years on the BBWAA's ballot 1985-99, topping out at 25.5% of the vote. He went through the Veterans Committee three times and never received more than 16.0% of the vote. 75% is needed for Hall of Fame induction.Lolich retired with a 217-191 record and a 3.44 ERA in 3,638 ⅓ innings. He is Detroit's all-time leader in strikeouts (2,679) and ranks among the franchise leaders in wins (207), games (508), and innings (3,361 ⅔), among other things.\n            ",

Clark's golf experience extended through sister company Optum's sponsorship of The Players Championship, where he collaborated with key partners like the Golf Channel and NBC.\"Golf is a game with a rare and enduring impact on individuals, families, and communities, and the PGA of America sits at the center of that influence,\" Clark said in a statement released by the PGA. \"Our greatest strength is our PGA of America Golf Professionals -- trusted leaders in their communities who introduce, teach, and grow the game in every corner of the world. At an important moment for golf, we have the right people, the right assets, and a meaningful opportunity to lead with purpose.\"I am grateful for the trust the Officers and Board have placed in me. My focus will be on providing clarity, strengthening our culture, and empowering our teams to support our Members and PGA of America Golf Professionals at the highest level, while elevating our major championships and marquee events as defining stages for the game, our partners, and the communities we serve.\"\nClark's appointment follows Derek Sprague's departure from the position in early January. Sprague was the first person to serve as both a past president and CEO at the PGA of America before stepping down from the latter role less than one year into his tenure.\n            \n    ",

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Seahawks vs. Patriots, and which side of the Super Bowl spread is the better value?

    "body": "\n        The final NFL DFS slate of the season arrives on Sunday at Levi's Stadium when the 2026 Super Bowl unfolds between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots (+4.5 at DraftKings) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Some of the year's biggest daily Fantasy producers will be on display as Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was second among receivers in Fantasy points, while New England quarterback Drake Maye was third among quarterbacks. They'll be popular NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60, but are they the best values, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the 2026 Super Bowl, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.\nNow, McClure has turned his attention to the 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60 is Smith-Njigba, who is looking to cap a monster season where he led the NFL in receiving yardage at 1,793. After a relatively quiet week in the divisional round, he got back to his dominant ways against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, posting a 10-153-1 receiving line. By Super Bowl standards, the Patriots did not have an elite Fantasy defense against receivers this season, ranking 10th in Fantasy points allowed to that position group. They've also given up a touchdown to an opposing receiver in three of the past four games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Smith-Njigba to go Over 94.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp. The 32-year-old has become a secondary option this season, but he has seen his target share increase a bit in the NFL playoffs. That helped lead to a touchdown against the Rams in the NFC title game. With elite New England cornerback Christian Gonzalez likely shadowing Smith-Njigba for much of the game, there's a great chance that Kupp will get more opportunities on Sunday, all at a very affordable NFL DFS price. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Kupp to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in Patriots vs. Seahawks. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for the Super Bowl, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl 60 matchup is set, with the New England Patriots representing the AFC and the Seattle Seahawks coming from the NFC. You can make Patriots vs. Seahawks picks well before the kickoff on Sunday, Feb. 8, and it's fitting these are the only two teams left to make NFL bets on. That's because they boast the two best spread records this year, with Seattle at 14-5 and New England at 13-6-1. However, that also means they aren't making it easy to make 2026 Super Bowl predictions which such a small ATS margin between them.Seattle is favored by 4.5 points per the latest Super Bowl odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Underdogs have covered 52.6% of the time in Super Bowl history, which is close to the flip of a coin, so that Super Bowl spread trend may not help much with your Seahawks vs. Patriots bets. Thus, seeking out some NFL betting advice is essential. Before locking in any Super Bowl picks or NFL prop bets, be sure to check out the Super Bowl best bets and predictions from SportsLine's red-hot Vegas experts. \nSportsLine has more than 40 hand-picked Vegas experts who excel in multiple spots. The NFL, however, is a strength for the site as SportsLine currently has five total experts who are on NFL runs that have returned $1,000 or more for $100 players and one who has returned more than $1,500.

Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top Super Bowl expert picks from Micah RobertsRoberts, a former Vegas bookmaker, is 11-4 (+658) over his last 15 Patriots ATS picks. For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under 77.5 rushing yards (-125).\"New England's run defense is damn stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (46.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too. Last 46.5 on our board. Our model has 44 points. Sagarin has 45.2.\" See the rest of Severance's picks here, and bet the total here:\nHow to make 2026 Super Bowl picksSportsLine's team of experts also includes Brady Kannon, a former SuperContest winner who enters Super Bowl LX on a sizzling 29-15 run (66%) on NFL picks, returning over $1,200 for $100 players. You can find out who his NFL picks are for the Super Bowl 2026 here. If you are looking for NFL picks, NFL props, or NFL best bets for Super Bowl 60, SportsLine has you covered with its proven team of experts.

    "body": "\n        Montana football coach Bobby Hauck, the winningest coach in Big Sky Conference history, will retire effective immediately, the school announced. Wide receivers coach Bobby Kennedy will take over as coach and oversee the program moving forward.Hauck, 61, served two stints as the Grizzlies' head coach, first from 2003 to 2009 and again from 2018 through the 2025 season. Over 14 seasons leading his alma mater, he compiled a 151-43 record with Montana, winning eight Big Sky titles, appearing in four FCS National Championship Games, earning 13 playoff berths and 20 FCS playoff wins -- the third-most in tournament history.\"There's never a convenient spot in the college football calendar to announce you're retiring, so today's as good as any,\" Hauck said Wednesday at a press conference. \"I wasn't going to have them spread my ashes on the practice field because I dropped dead out there. There comes a juncture where it's time to do something else.\"Hauck said the decision, which he added he made Monday, stemmed largely from the evolving challenges of college football and from having more days recently in which he did not enjoy coming to work.\n\"Dealing from my job and the head coach's desk -- this may be the most important thing I say here -- dealing with what college football has become is not always enjoyable as a head coach,\" Hauck said. \"I just haven't been enjoying it enough. I want to enjoy my career and my job. A lot of the head coach stuff in current day Division I college football is not enjoyable. I think it's the perfect time for me to retire.\"He retires as the Big Sky's all-time leader in overall wins (151) and conference victories (86). At the conclusion of the 2025 season, which ended with a 48-23 loss to rival Montana State in the semifinals of the FCS playoffs, Hauck was the winningest active FCS coach and the third-winningest active coach in all of Division I football at his current program.Hauck's accolades include four Big Sky Coach of the Year honors, four AFCA FCS Regional Coach of the Year awards and three finalist nods for the Eddie Robinson FCS Coach of the Year Award. He also served as president of the American Football Coaches Association in 2025.\nBefore returning to Montana, Hauck coached UNLV from 2010-14, guiding the Rebels to their first winning season in 13 years in 2013. He then spent three seasons as special teams coordinator and associate head coach at San Diego State.\n            ",

Adam Silver will have to name a replacement player to the World team, with Rockets center Alperen Sengün and Sixers center Joel Embiid as two of the most prominent snubs from the potential World roster pool. Gilgeous-Alexander is the heavy favorite to win back-to-back MVP awards, and if his absence is limited to the current timetable for his re-evaluation, he shouldn't have any issues with awards eligibility. Gilgeous-Alexander has played in 49 of the Thunder's 51 games, and will only miss five games before the All-Star break provides some welcome time off to recover. If he were to be held out until the beginning of March as a precaution, he would still only have 12 missed games of the 17 allowed to remain eligible for MVP voting. His top competition for the award, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokić, has missed 16 games and cannot afford more than one more absence this season to be eligible. \nAs for the Thunder, their next four games are all against West playoff teams, with the San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns on the schedule before finishing with a game against the Milwaukee Bucks before the break. The Thunder are 2-0 this season without Gilgeous-Alexander, beating the Memphis Grizzlies and Utah Jazz, but this upcoming stretch will further test their depth without the services of their MVP guard. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        James Harden expressed thanks for his two-and-a-half seasons spent with the Los Angeles Clippers, stating he did not request a trade to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 11-time All-Star was shipped to the Cavaliers at the NBA trade deadline in exchange for Darius Garland and a future second-round pick.\"In life, not even just basketball, when things don't work out, there are ways to end things in relationships without having to crack each other,\" Harden told ESPN in his first interview since being traded. \"Okay, maybe we just don't see a future with each other. Maybe we just outgrew each other, whatever the case may be. I feel like other situations weren't like that. And that's why I can respect Steve and L and TLu because they didn't put me in a weird position as much as everybody tried to make it like that.\"Ironically, after acknowledging the trade was not initiated by him, Harden said he \"didn't want to feel like I was holding the Clippers up in their future. I wanted them to actually have a chance to rebuild and get some draft capital.\"That sounds like a player who wanted out. Nonetheless, both sides after happy after Harden joins a title threat while Los Angeles begins its roster transformation with a star 10 years younger than the player it traded.Garland  spent the first seven seasons of his career with the Cavaliers. He missed the last 10 games with a toe injury.\nWith Cleveland situated as the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference at 30-21 overall, Harden will be paired with a backcourt mate in Donovan Mitchell who averages 28.8 points per game along with frontcourt difference-makers Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen he can feed down low.Harden started 44 games for the Clippers, with his highest scoring average -- 25.4 points per game -- since leading the NBA in scoring at a 34.3 clip during the 2019-20 season with Houston. More production at the offensive end for Harden meant less distribution, however. His 8.1 assists is the lowest rate since that same campaign with the Rockets. Entering Wednesday night's game against the Clippers, the Cavaliers have won eight of their last 10 games.\n\"In Cleveland I see an opportunity to win in the East -- they got a very good team, coaching staff, all of the above,\" Harden said. \"So as much as I wanted to stay in LA and give it a go -- I've never won one before. As a basketball mind I think we have a bit better chance.\"\n            ",

Henry racked up over 100 yards on the ground and scored two touchdowns during the first half against Green Bay to move to 10th on the NFL all-time rushing yards list.The milestone for the future Hall of Fame running back came on the Ravens' second offensive possession. Also on that drive, Henry scored career touchdown No. 120 to tie former star running back Adrian Peterson for the fourth-most rushing touchdowns in NFL history.Henry, 31, has been steadily moving up the ranks on the all-time rushing list this season. Last month, Henry passed NFL legend Jim Brown against the Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving. Henry entered the night having rushed for 12,676 yards.\nPer CBS Sports research, Henry had the most rushing attempts (15) by any player on his team's first two drives of the game since former Denver Broncos running back Olandis Gary did it in 1999. Henry now has 25 games with at least 100 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, which is tied for the most in NFL history with Brown and LaDainian Tomlinson.\nDuring his first season with the Ravens last year, Henry racked up 1,921 yards and 16 touchdowns.

    "body": "\n        There were plenty of reasons why the Los Angeles Chargers lost to the Houston Texans on Saturday, but the most shocking one was the fact that Cameron Dicker had the first meltdown of his career.The Chargers kicker cost his team four points with a missed 32-yard field goal and a missed extra point in the 20-16 loss. Dicker missing two short kicks in one game might have been the most statistically improbable kicking meltdown the NFL has ever seen. Going into Week 17, Dicker had made 94.1% of his field goal attempts, which makes him the most accurate kicker in NFL history (No other kicker is even at 90%). Dicker had never missed two kicks in one game in his entire career, but that changed against Houston. The first miss came with just under 20 seconds left to play in the first half. After Elijah Molden came up with a huge interception, that set the Chargers up with the ball in Houston territory. The Chargers drive eventually came to an end at Houston's 14-yard line and that's when Dicker was sent out for a 32-yard field goal, a kick that's usually automatic for him. And when we say automatic, we mean automatic: Going into Saturday's game, Dicker had NEVER missed a field goal from inside 40 yards in his career (He was 68 of 68). But then that streak came to a sudden end. \nThe kick would have cut Houston's lead to 14-6, but with the miss, the Texans went into halftime with a 14-3 lead.  \nThe only thing more stunning then Dicker's field goal miss was his missed extra point, which came with just over three minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. After a 5-yard touchdown run by Omarion Hampton cut the lead to 20-16, Dicker had a chance to trim the lead to just three points, but instead, he shanked the extra point.\nGoing into that kick, Dicker had made 57 straight extra points in the regular season. It's impossible to say how the game would have played out if Dicker made both of those kicker, but it's very possible that the Chargers would have taken the Texans to overtime. \nLet's to a quick recap of Dicker's stunning meltdown: He missed two kicks in a game for the FIRST time in his careerHe missed a field goal from inside 40 yards for the first time in his careerHe only had two misses all season on 71 kicks (Field goals and extra points) going into Week 17His streak of 57 straight successful extra points came to an endAnd all of this happened to a kicker who was just voted to the Pro Bowl last week as the AFC's kicker. Dicker had only missed a total of two kicks ALL season, which is why he got the Pro Bowl nod. Going into Week 17, he was 36 of 38 on field goals this year, including 19 of 19 from inside 40, and he was 33 of 33 on extra points. The only good news for the Chargers is that they've already clinched a playoff spot, so Dicker will likely get a chance to redeem himself in the postseason. With the Chargers' loss, the Broncos clinched the AFC West, which means L.A. could be in spot to rest its starters in Week 18 against Denver. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Texans' 20-16 win over the Chargers on Saturday night to improve to 11-5, Houston clinched a spot in the playoffs, eliminating the 8-7 Colts in the process. Indianapolis becomes just the sixth team in NFL history to start a season 8-2 and miss the playoffs and the first to do so since the 1995 Raiders. That's not the kind of history any team hopes to make, and it underscores what a disaster the second half of the season has been for Indianapolis. They began the season as the NFL's best story, with Daniel Jones getting a redemption arc with a fresh start in Indy, leading an offense that was the best in the league. With the playoffs firmly in their sights and an AFC lacking a dominant force, the Colts understandably took a swing at the trade deadline, shipping two first round picks to the Jets for star corner Sauce Gardner. However, things went off the rails for Indianapolis shortly after the trade deadline, leaving the franchise and its fans worried about its immediate future. Jones was hobbled with a fractured fibula, Gardner got injured early in his third game in Indy and Jones eventually tore his Achilles to end his season. As injuries have piled up, the Colts have lost their last five games, the last two coming with 44-year-old Philip Rivers playing quarterback after he signed with the teams after being retired for nearly five years. \nIt has been the ultimate disaster scenario for Indy. Losing Jones to a catastrophic injury leads to questions about whether he'll be the short or long-term answer at quarterback. However, with the Jets owning their 2026 (and 2027) first-round pick from the Gardner trade, they won't even have the option of taking a swing in April's NFL Draft. It's an unfortunate situation, especially because we so rarely see teams truly try to capitalize on a surprising seasons. The Colts took a huge swing and struck out, and now will serve as a cautionary tale for future front offices wondering if it's worth doing the same. It being the Texans that eliminated them officially only adds salt to the wound in Indy. Not only are the Texans division rivals, but Houston makes a bit of history themselves by becoming just the seventh team to make the postseason after an 0-3 start. The last team to do it? The 2018 Texans. \nThe Colts will play a key role in exactly where Houston ends up in the AFC seeding. The Colts finish the season against the Jaguars in Week 17 and the Texans in Week 18, with Houston needing a win over Indy next week and a Jacksonville loss against either the Colts or Titans in the final two weeks to win the AFC South. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 17 is going to have a massive impact on the playoff picture in both the AFC and the NFC.Entering the Christmas Day tripleheader, there were already five teams that have clinched playoff berths in each conference, with still four total spots in the playoffs up for grabs. That number changed to three when the Green Bay Packers earned a berth thanks to the Minnesota Vikings' win over the Detroit Lions. Additionally, we still have plenty to go when it comes to the seeding in each conference, including who will be the No. 1 seeds.The nightcap of the Christmas tripleheader had playoff implications as well as the Denver Broncos strengthened their hold on the top seed in the AFC by defeating the Kansas City Chiefs.On Saturday, the Baltimore Ravens kept their faint playoff hopes alive by beating the Green Bay Packers, who are now locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC. Additionally, the Houston Texans wrapped up the AFC's last wild card spot as the Los Angeles Chargers' loss against Houston clinched the AFC West division title for the Broncos. This marks the first non-Chiefs AFC West division crown since the Broncos last won the division in 2015, the year they won Super Bowl 50. \nOn Sunday, the Steelers can wrap up the AFC North with a win over the Browns. If they should lose, that will set up a winner-take-all game against the Ravens for the division crown in Week 18. The Jaguars can inch closer to winning the AFC South title with a win against the Colts. The Buccaneers can put some pressure on the Panthers, who themselves can throw a wrench into the Seahawks' plans for the top seed in the NFC. Both the Eagles and Bills are already in the playoffs but can still move up in the seedings. And the Bears and 49ers are trying to jockey for positioning in the NFC and keep their No. 1 seed hopes alive. Then we get to the Rams on Monday night, who have a lot to play for when it comes to both the NFC West and the wild card race.As we continue to monitor the latest movements in the playoff standings, here is an up-to-date look at where things stand.AFC standingsy-Denver Broncos (13-3)x-New England Patriots (12-3)x-Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)x-Buffalo Bills (11-4)x-Houston Texans (11-5)x-Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)x-clinched playoff berth; y-clinched division\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1.

New England Patriots (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots secured their spot in the playoffs after rallying for an 11-point deficit against the Ravens to move to 12-3 on the season. The victory not only clinched their spot in the postseason, but it continued to keep the Bills at arms length for first place in the AFC East.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars made a statement in Week 16 that they are a serious player in the AFC playoff race after beating the Broncos on the road.

Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)Remaining schedule: at BroncosThe Chargers had their four-game winning streak snapped with a Saturday afternoon loss against the Texans. Currently, they are the last wild card in the AFC. They'll need to go full tilt against the Denver Broncos in Week 18 for any hope of avoiding being the conference's No. 7 seed. \nIn the huntThe Ravens (8-8), with Lamar Jackson sidelined, kept their playoff hopes alive with an impressive road win against the Packers in Green Bay. Baltimore's only path to the playoffs is via the AFC North.

San Francisco 49ers (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe 49ers are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race and clinched a postseason berth after the Lions fell to the Steelers. San Francisco jumped the Rams into the No. 5 spot after walloping the Colts on \"Monday Night Football,\" and it's positioned to climb even higher over the final two weeks.\nIf the 49ers beat the Bears and Seahawks to close out the season, they'll secure the No. 1 seed and the conference's lone first-round bye.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are still a playoff lock thanks to their win in Week 15, but their chances of winning the NFC West and claiming the No. 1 seed in the conference were dramatically reduced by their loss to the Seahawks in Week 16. They need Seattle to lose at least one more game, but also can't have the 49ers win out. Otherwise, San Francisco would be the top seed in the conference by virtue of having the best division record among the three teams. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)Remaining schedule: at VikingsGreen Bay, minus Jordan Love, fell to Derrick Henry and the Ravens on Saturday night. The loss ended any hopes of winning the NFC North title and locked Green Bay into the NFC's No. 7 seed.\nIn the huntThe Buccaneers (7-8) have fallen out of first place in the NFC South after falling to the Panthers in Week 16. The only path for Baker Mayfield and Co. to make the playoffs at this point is to win the division, so there is zero margin for error over these final two weeks. They'll need to take care of business on Sunday in Miami against the Dolphins before hosting the Panthers in what could be a win-and-in scenario in Week 18. \n            ",

Williams said something to Alvarado who grabbed the Suns' big man and the two started going at it, with Alvarado throwing punches and connecting with a right hook. \nAlvarado and Williams were both ejected for their roles in the scrap, which was a far more legitimate fight than most tussles we see happen on an NBA court. The best part of it all was Jordan Poole's face in the background when Alvarado landed the punch (0:35 mark of the above video). \nAlvarado was still hot after getting pulled away and sprinted to the back, seemingly ready to continue things in the hallway by the locker rooms. He will likely be facing fairly stiff punishment from the NBA as the one to escalate things and connecting on a punch. Williams was less aggressive in his role in the brouhaha and will await the NBA's decision on whether he'll get further discipline than the ejection. \nThe Suns went on to win, 123-114, after the fight to notch back-to-back wins in New Orleans and improve to 18-13 on the season, as they battle for a playoff spot in the West. \n            \n    ",

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

Stroud. Houston has the league's top defense, ranking first in both points allowed and yards allowed, and it's a defense that Justin Herbert knows all too well. In the Jan. 2025 playoff game between these teams, Houston picked off Herbert four times, which is one more pick than Herbert had in the entire 2024 regular season. Speaking of turnovers, the Texans have committed an NFL-low of five giveaways during their 10-2 run over their last dozen games, and they're on pace to be the first team in 17 years to not allow 250 passing yards in a game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverWhile the Texans have lost multiple games ATS during their winning streak, the same can't be said about L.A. which has covered in all four games of its four-game win streak. The Chargers have clinched a playoff spot, but they still has a huge incentive in front of them as they can get the No. 1 seed, and a bye, if they win out. Meanwhile, Los Angeles' defense has actually performed better than Houston's over the last two months as L.A. has given up a league-low of 254.5 total yards over the last eight games. The Chargers also have a big historical edge in regard to the spread, going 7-3 versus the line over their 10 all-time meetings. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Texans vs. Chargers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Chargers vs. Texans 10,000 times and is going Over on the total. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Texans vs. Chargers, and which side of the spread is the better value?

    "body": "\n        The SEC and the ACC collide in the 2025 Gator Bowl when the Missouri Tigers take on the Virginia Cavaliers on Saturday. UVA (10-3) saw a trip to the College Football Playoff get derailed in an upset loss to Duke in the ACC title game. Missouri had playoff aspirations after a 6-1 start, but the Tigers lost three of their last five -- all to teams ranked in the top 10 at the time of the game -- to end the season at 8-4 overall. Missouri quarterback Beau Pribula is heading to the portal and won't play in this one.

The total has dropped since opening at 50.5, with Pribula's absence factoring into that line movement. Missouri, howeverr, has a relatively experienced backup in Matt Zollers. Zollers started three games this season when Pribula was injured and threw three touchdowns against just one interception in that span. The Tigers also have one of the best backs in the country in Ahmad Hardy, who led the SEC with 1,560 yards on the ground this year.Virginia, meanwhile, averaged 32.6 points per game. Quarterback Chandler Morris completed 64.8% of passes for 2,802 yards and 16 touchdowns. Running back J'Mari Taylor, who is questionable, led the ACC with 1,062 rushing yards, so both teams have plenty of ways to move the ball, though Taylor's status is uncertain as he mulls his future. SportsLine's model projects 51 combined points in this matchup as the Over hits nearly 60% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Missouri vs. Virginia and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

Richards has already been ruled out for Palace's match against Tottenham on Sunday by manager Oliver Glasner, who didn't give a timetable for Richards' return, but he did note that Richards could be back for their game on New Year's Day. How to watch Crystal Palace vs. Tottenham, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 11:30 a.m.Location: Selhurst Park -- LondonTV: USA Odds: Crystal Palace +120; Draw +230; Tottenham +240But Richards is optimistic, saying that it \"won't be long\" until he's back in the fold for Palace.\"Thanks everybody for the messages, won't be long till I'm back,\" Richards wrote on Instagram.\nNot only is that something positive for Palace fans, but it's also important for Mauricio Pochettino and the United States men's national team. Tyler Adams will be out for 2-3 months after tearing his MCL for Bournemouth against Manchester United, and an injury to more key members of his first-choice XI would be a speed bump in preparation for the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Richards and the 38-year-old Tim Ream are the clear top defenders for the USMNT, and with their best performances for Pochettino coming in a back three, losing a starting defender would be a massive blow to depth. Richards has become a critical piece of the Palace defense and one of the first names on the teamsheet as he grows as a defender under Glasner. \nTaking part in the Europa Conference League, Palace have quite a run of matches in their future, and they'll also want their backline to be in top shape when those are coming over the horizon. After facing Tottenham on Sunday, Palace will play four games in 10 days from Jan. 1-10 before getting back to a standard schedule.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State coach Tom Izzo expressed more concern about college basketball's future following Baylor landing former 2023 NBA Draft pick James Nnaji. It represents an unprecedented move after his multiple professional years in Europe. Nnaji, who never signed an NBA contract, most recently played with Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey on loan from Spain's FC Barcelona. He averaged 7.5 and 4.0 rebounds with Yukatel Merkezefendi. Nnaji and Barcelona mutually agreed to part ways after the 2024-25 season before he played with the Knicks in the 2025 Summer League.Now, Baylor and coach Scott Drew get an immediately eligible 21-year-old 7-footer to help fill the frontcourt void left by injuries to Juslin Bodo Bodo (arm) and Maikcol Perez (ACL).\"Now we're taking guys that were drafted in the NBA and everything?,\" Izzo said. \"I said it to you a month and a half ago – c'mon Magic (Johnson) and Gary (Harris), let's go baby, let's do it. Why not? I mean, if that's what we're going to, shame on the NCAA. Shame on the coaches, too. But shame on the NCAA, because coaches are gonna do what they gotta do, I guess. But the NCAA is the one. Those people on those committees that are making those decisions to allow something so ridiculous and not think of the kid.\"So everybody talks about me thinking of my program or I'm selfish. No. Get that straight, for all of you. I'm thinking of, what is best for my son if he was in that position? And I just don't agree with it.\"\nIzzo said he would like to \"poll 360 coaches\" and see how many agreed with this ruling in favor of Baylor. Izzo previously ripped transfer portal culture in August.\"Write this one down: It's gonna get me,\" Izzo said. \"I'm just not gonna let it bother me. But it's gonna get me sooner or later. Sooner or later, it's gonna get me. Not that I'm too stubborn not to ever do anything.\"Izzo later directed his criticism toward NCAA president Charlie Baker, though he didn't mention him by name.\n\"What we've done in the NCAA has been an absolute travesty to me,\" Izzo said. \"We're just worried about getting sued and we're not gonna fight anybody. And I think leadership means you fight and you make decisions that are sometimes unpopular.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders officially ruled out defensive end Maxx Crosby for Sunday's game against the New York Giants due to a knee injury and later placed the star pass rusher on injured reserve, ending his 2025-26 season. That announcement comes on the heels of reports that Crosby left the team facility after receiving the news from the team that he wouldn't play, a decision he \"vehemently\" disagreed with, according to Fox.\nWhen first-year Raiders coach Pete Carroll addressed reporters Friday, he said Crosby will not play in Week 17 and has been dealing with a nagging knee injury since the Kansas City Chiefs game in Week 7. He also acknowledged that Crosby was understandably frustrated with the team's decision to withhold him from playing, so Carroll excused him from the building.\"We talked when he was getting out of here that he's been fighting this thing for nine weeks or whenever Kansas City was,\" Carroll said. \"Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play. We've worked with him to get through it. After an evaluation we did on Monday or Tuesday, it's just too bad. He didn't want to take the news like that. I didn't want to take the news like that. ... If we'd have let him, he'd have been out there, and he would not have hesitated. But he knows he's banged up.\"He said, 'I'd like to get out of here,'\" Carroll added. \"I said, 'Yeah, get out of here. Take off.'\"\nAsked to characterize Crosby's reaction to being shut down, Carroll said it was \"exactly like you think he would do and should do.\" Knowing Crosby's competitive nature, Carroll said he expected that response, especially since Crosby has been battling through the injury for weeks.\"As a matter of fact, I anticipated it all the way throughout,\" Carroll said. \"I've been with him since I saw him get on the bus in the Kansas City game -- just having trouble stepping up onto the bus and getting out of that game. He's just been fighting his ass off the whole time. He's impeccably positioned himself as good a competitor as you can be. You can't battle more than he's battled. He'd do anything to be playing.\"\n        \n            \n                Battle for draft top pick: Giants at Raiders set for rare Week 17 matchup that NFL hasn't seen in 44 years\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCarroll denied that this decision would cause a rift between Crosby and the organization, despite speculation that the star pass rusher could now be a trade target in the offseason. While he didn't rule out Crosby for Week 18, Carroll did say it was a possibility.\nAt 2-13, the Raiders and Giants are both in contention for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and their Week 17 meeting will have major implications on which team picks first in April. The Raiders are 2.5-point home underdogs against the Giants, per DraftKings Sportsbook. Crosby was asked about the possibility of the Raiders landing the No. 1 pick earlier this week and was blunt with his feelings on the subject.\"I don't give a s--- about the pick to be honest,\" Crosby told reporters Tuesday. \"I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world and that's what I'm focused on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence -- being that guy on a consistent basis for my team. That's [the NFL Draft] their job, the front office, the coaches, they do that. But that's got nothing to do with me.\" \nThe 28-year-old Crosby, one of the NFL's top pass rushers, has long been thought of as a top trade candidate, especially for a Las Vegas team that seems headed toward a long rebuild period. The Dallas Cowboys reportedly showed significant interest in Crosby before the 2025 trade deadline, but no deal materialized.Crosby, who has been vocal about his desire to stay with the Raiders, signed a three-year contract extension worth $106.5 million in March. At the time, it made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. A fourth-round pick of the Raiders in the 2019 NFL Draft, Crosby has two second-team All-Pro honors and five Pro Bowl appearances during his time with the Raiders. He led the NFL in tackles for loss from 2022-23 and has reached double-digit sacks in three of the last four seasons. In 15 games this season, Crosby has 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss and 10 sacks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chelsea had Aston Villa right where they wanted them, that was until Unai Emery's adjustments and brilliance from Ollie Watkins led the visitors to a 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Make no mistake, with this win is further proof that Villa are Premier League title contenders.  Not picking up their first league win of the season until the end of September, facing Fulham, Villa have been unstoppable since, racking up 13 consecutive wins in all competitions, despite defying the numbers even in this match. Chelsea may have only put three shots on goal, but they were able to generate 2.14 expected goals, most of which came from Joao Pedro's goal from close range in the first half. In the second half, Watkins, Jadon Sancho, and Amadou Onana entered, and it changed everything for Villa. They scored both their goals, outshot Chelsea 11-4 and also had an xG of 1.40 to 0.16. Changes like that come right down to tactics, and there are few better at preparing a team of perceived underdogs to be competitive in a match than Unai Emery.He's taken down Arsenal, Manchester City, and now Chelsea in order to draw within three points of the Gunners as we turn to the new year. The title race is very much on, and even Villa's numbers are beginning to improve as they have the fourth-best goal difference in the league, thanks to Emi Martinez and the defense allowing only 19 goals in 18 matches played this season. Scoring four goals while allowing two in their last two matches will do that, and it sets up quite a clash on the horizon. Villa can enter the new year top of the league if they can take down Arsenal again away at the Emirates Stadium on Dec. 30.All eyes would already be on that match with Emery facing a team that he formerly coached, but when Villa haven't won the league since 1981 before the Premier League was formed, and despite being an unlikely suspect outperforming their numbers on all fronts, it's time to take Villa seriously. They've already taken large strides upon returning to the Champions League for next season, opening a seven-point lead over fourth-place Liverpool with their win on Saturday. \nIt has been a true team effort, but after the defense, winger Morgan Rodgers taking a step forward has gone a long way to powering this team. With seven goals and three assists, he is also pushing to represent England at the World Cup in 2026 and is certainly on the right track. With an upcoming schedule including Arsenal and Crystal Palace, Villa's title credentials will continue to be tested during the upcoming stretch, but it's nothing that Emery won't have them prepared for. Despite that, Villa's manager is playing down their chances of winning the title, instead suggesting that his team are locked in a battle for fourth place.\"I am feeling that we are competing for Europe, not competing in the league with Man City and Arsenal,\" Emery said. \"We have played 18 matches and have 20 to play. Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United -- we must compete with them. We must be consistent over 38 matches.\"\nMaking sure that his team doesn't get ahead of themselves is something that makes sense, but even in a battle for Europe, Villa are in pole position. But numbers-wise, the title could be just beyond their reach.On one hand, only Tottenham have had a similar 10-goal overperformance of their xG, like Aston Villa, but considering their reliance on set plays, it makes sense as to why that would happen. This has become the league of set plays as teams have ensured that they make the most of every goal-scoring opportunity, but Emery was doing it before it became the rage. A manager doesn't coach four Europa League-winning sides without making the most of every opportunity, but if he's able to win the Premier League, it'd be the biggest trophy of his career to date.Villa are on track to do something special this season, and they have the leadership at the helm to get it done. With the January transfer window about to swing open, it's also a chance to add reinforcements for what could be a stretch run for the ages.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When news broke that James Harden was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Darius Garland on Tuesday night, the headlines immediately started to write themselves. When the going gets tough, Harden gets going. As in, somewhere else. This time it's Cleveland... after it didn't work out with the Clippers... after he blew his way out of Philadelphia... after he bounced on Brooklyn. Early exits -- from teams, from the playoffs -- are going to be part of Harden's legacy, and certainly his post-Houston track record, on paper, warrants such criticism. This is where I remind you, however, that Houston did happen. Harden did stay with one team for eight years fighting the good fight against one of the great dynasties the NBA has ever seen. In the eye of the superteam storm, Harden went at the Warriors as an effective one-man offense year after year after year. That was part of the problem, of course, but the point is he never looked for anything that would've constituted an easy way out in the 2010s. Rather, he chose the hardest route possible, each season signing right back up for the same bloody fight against the same basically unbeatable opponent in the same behemoth conference believing he could eventually prevail. \nAnd he nearly did. Were it not for Chris Paul's ripped hamstring in 2018, there's a good chance Harden has a ring and all of these post-Houston sojourns (if they even would've played out the same way in the first place) become footnotes in what would be a vastly different career bio. Instead, this game of musical teams he has played over the second half his career is starting to overshadow all the amazing stuff he did in the first half. We'll see how these last few chapters play out, beginning in Cleveland, but if it all were to end right now Harden would have three main bullet points in his bio. One of the greatest scorers of all time. One of the most egregious foul baiters of all time. Serial sell out who never won a ring.There's no debating the first one. The second one is a big part of this conversation, because let's be honest, it's easy to hate Harden. He's one of the most annoying superstars the league has ever known. He comes off as the epitome of selfish basketball. He plays meme-level defense. He dupes referees into phantom fouls. Charisma is not a crutch on which Harden can lean. His math game is boring, and the numbers have looked pretty ugly on a lot of postseason occasions. It paints a loser picture if that's what you want to see, and a loser jumping teams is even worse than a winner doing it. \nBut that's perceptions talking. The realities of Harden's last three exits are, at the very least, a lot more layered than we're going to make them out to be. Yes, he forced his way out of Philly and burned a bridge with Daryl Morey as he left, but his tenures in L.A. and Brooklyn included major dramas Harden played no part in creating. Kawhi's money might have actually grown on trees. Kyrie Irving, one of Harden's Big Three teammates, wasn't suiting up for the Nets. What was he supposed to do, stay out of loyalty? Loyalty's in the dollar, kid. And in the end, that's the only thing Harden has been chasing since he left Houston. This isn't about a ring. It's about a contract extension. One he knew he wasn't going to get from the Clippers. One he thought he was going to get from the 76ers. One he hopes he's going to get from the Cavaliers. You might call that a ridiculous priority for a guy who's already made $375 million dollars playing basketball. I would probably agree with you on that front. But still, this isn't as much about an unhappy basketball player as we want it to be. It's about money. As almost everything in this world is. \nIf Harden sees a chance to score another contract in the dwindling days of his Hall of Fame career, like almost every athlete in history, he's going to do it. If the 76ers had given him that, he'd still be there. If the Clippers had signaled a desire to remain in the Harden business beyond 2027, he'd probably still be there. But in this case, the team wanted this trade more than the player did. And why not? The Clippers just flipped a 36-year-old Harden for a 26-year-old Garland, who, when healthy, is an All-Star point guard that would normally cost multiple draft picks to acquire. This is not a case of a superstar at the height of his leverage forcing a team into something it didn't want to do. \n        \n            \n                James Harden-Darius Garland trade grades: Clippers clearly come out ahead of Cavaliers in All-Star swap\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe bigger question is why the Cavaliers did want to do it, and again, even if there is no recent evidence that the teams who have brought Harden in have wound up better for doing so, there's a logical answer. And that answer is this: Every situation is different. That's why we should judge all of these Harden exits on their own, rather than as a pattern. They were all unique. They weren't all his doing. Even if, when the time finally came, he was a brat on his way out. \nIn Cleveland's case, the Cavs are thinking short term. They're not building around Harden. They might not even give him the extension he wants. But for this season, which carries with it a golden opportunity to win the East and compete for a championship, Harden is averaging 25 and 8 while Garland is hurt and uncertain to return to full health before the postseason. In the immediacy, the Cavs got better on Tuesday. In the long run, so did the Clippers. And in the end, that's why this deal got done. Because it worked for both sides. Not because James Harden demanded that it happen. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        On Tuesday's episode of the Eye On College Basketball Podcast that we did on CBS Sports Network, Matt Norlander and I settled into a conversation about UConn and its body of work to date. Simply put, I'm higher on it than he is. To be clear, we both think the Huskies would be a No. 1 seed if the NCAA Tournament started today. But whereas I would have them as the second-highest No. 1 seed, Norlander said he'd have them lower, in part because UConn's 22-1 record only features five Quadrant 1 victories. Arizona and Duke have nine. Michigan has eight. \n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Iowa State jumps UConn for fourth No. 1 seed in NCAA Tournament bracket projection\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd if somebody wants to use those facts to argue against the Huskies, fine. The CBS Sports Bracketology model has UConn as a No. 2 seed, but needless to say, this is all subjective.) But it should also be pointed out that none of this is UConn's fault as much as it's a commentary on the Big East. The Huskies are 5-1 in Q1 games. \nBut did you realize they had four way back on Dec. 9 thanks to a non-league strength of schedule that rated top 25 nationally? And did you realize they haven't played a single game against a currently ranked team since then? That's UConn's problem -- the underwhelming BIg East. \nSt. John's is the only Big East team besides UConn currently ranked, there are no other Big East teams in the top 30 of the NET, and more than half of the conference is ranked outside of the top 75. Consequently, UConn has had just one Q1 opportunity so far in league play -- last month's game at Seton Hall. The Huskies defeated the Pirates 69-64.  UConn is projected to have just four more games vs. Q1 opponents before next month's Big East Tournament   \nBottom line, UConn is 22-1, undefeated when not missing two starters, and a clear contender to win a national championship for what would be the third time in a four-year span. So I've decided to respect those things rather than get caught up on how the Big East barely provides Q1 chances for the Huskies, and that's why UConn remains No. 2 in Wednesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings following Tuesday night's 92-60 victory over Xavier that extended their winning streak to 18 games.

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye was an MVP-type player in the regular season, holding up against pressure and making big plays down the field.In the postseason, pressure has eaten him alive. He hasn't handled it well and the Patriots' offense has been awful in the playoffs.That can be a major problem in Sunday's Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks. That's because Seattle can flat out pressure the quarterback. They have a wave of defensive players who can attack up the field and create problems. Combine that with a New England offensive line that doesn't protect well, and Maye might have big problems. That's what ultimately will decide this game.When Seattle won a Super Bowl XLVIII with the Legion of Boom defense, the story seemed to always be about the guys on the back end. The reality is it should have been about the guys up front. If you can pressure with four, which they did, it makes it so much easier on the back end.\nThis version of Seattle's defense can do the same. That's the key to winning in the NFL. Pressure with four, and you can do so many things on the back end.The Seattle defense will make life hell for Maye and the New England offense. Let's not forget the Seahawks have the best run defense in the league. If you can't run it, all that does is turn the pass rushers loose.On the other side, the Patriots' defense has played well in the playoffs. But they faced a Los Angeles Chargers team with a horrible offensive line, got a C.J. Stroud meltdown against the Texans and then faced a backup in Jarrett Stidham against the Broncos in the AFC title game.\n\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Ranking every Patriots and Seahawks starter ahead of NFL championship devoid of star power\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThis Seattle offense is much more of a challenge. Quarterback Sam Darnold is playing well and offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak does a great job of scheming ways to get guys open. The Seahawks have also run the ball well down the stretch and into the playoffs.I don't think Seattle's offense will spend the game moving up and down the field, but the Seahawks will be able to feast on short fields given to them by the defense. I think Maye will turn it over a few times and the sacks will start to wear on him.This will be a day for the Seattle defense.Darnold will make the plays after the turnovers, but this will be a game about the basics of football -- blocking, tackling and influencing the quarterback.\nSeattle will do that best.Look for the Seahawks to win behind one of those defensive showings by their front that we will remember for a long time.Defense wins championships they say. But the reality is the fronts of the defense is what does it -- and Seattle will show that once again. Prediction: Seattle 27, Patriots 10\n            ",

Leonard was added to the player pool in order to satisfy the necessary number of players for the league's USA vs. World format.The new format will consist of three teams of eight players: two teams made up of American players, with one \"World\" team of the league's international talent. Of the 24 original All-Stars selected, there were only 15 American players, as Karl-Anthony Towns will play for the World team. Adding Leonard now brings the total to 15 American players.The players who will compete on each team will be revealed Tuesday night ahead of the Dallas Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics game.This marks another overhaul of the All-Star Game format. The league has toyed with different versions of the event, with last year marking the first turn at a round-robin tournament. The tournament style will remain the same this year, with three games being played to decide a winner of the weekend's events. However, how the matchups will be determined has yet to be announced.\nLeonard was considered one of the biggest snubs when All-Star announcements were made, as he's having his best season since his first year in L.A. He's averaging a career high 27.6 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.6 assists and is leading the league in steals at 2.1 a game. He's also been fairly durable this season, having played in 73% of the Clippers' games this season. That's a major bounce back from a season ago where he only appeared in 37 games, which he's set to match that total with the next appearance he makes.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tuesday afternoon gave us our first stunner of the 2026 NBA trade deadline in the Jaren Jackson Jr. deal, and now, we have yet another blockbuster. Darius Garland is headed for the Los Angeles Clippers along with a second-round pick. James Harden is joining the Cleveland Cavaliers. It is one of the most surprising trade the NBA has given us since, well, last February, when the Dallas Mavericks sent Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers in the dead of night for Anthony Davis in a move so controversial it eventually got their general manager fired.Just by virtue of the ages of the principle figures here, this trade will almost certainly be compared to that one. Part of what made the Dončić trade so unusual was that the Mavericks gave up a 25-year-old for a 31-year-old. Well, the age-gap here is even bigger. Harden is 36. Garland is 26.So... is this deal as bad for Cleveland as that one was for Dallas? Or did the Cavaliers have more justifiable reasons for making their point guard swap? Let's grade the deal below:\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Cavaliers: COn first glance, this trade makes no sense for Cleveland. Rarely does it ever make sense to trade a 26-year-old for a 36-year-old. Garland is a homegrown All-Star who was critical to Cleveland's 64-win season a year ago. The more you look at it, though, the more Cleveland's logic starts to come into focus.\nThe Cavaliers have now had Garland in the building for seven years. They've seen him play 70 games just once, last season, which was ultimately ruined by a toe injury. That same toe injury lingered into this year. Garland has not played since Jan. 14, and while he had picked things up in the weeks before then, his season overall had been a mess. It is entirely possible that Cleveland simply looked at Garland and decided he was unlikely to remain healthy moving forward.That was a significant problem for them in financial terms. They're a second-apron team as is. Jarrett Allen gets more expensive on an extension next season. Donovan Mitchell will presumably re-sign on a supermax deal in the summer of 2027, and Evan Mobley got a Rose Rule max after winning Defensive Player of the Year last season. They simply were not equipped to continue paying Garland max money. He has two years left on his original max contract after this one, and he is eligible for an extension this offseason.Cleveland could have waited things out. Maybe Garland would have stayed healthy in the playoffs. Maybe he would have been amenable to a pay cut. But we live in a world in which Trae Young just got cap dumped and Ja Morant is almost untradeable. The landscape just isn't kind for small guards right now. The Cavaliers seemingly didn't want to risk getting stuck with a max contract they didn't want. Perhaps they could have gotten draft picks for Garland elsewhere, but that probably would have meant taking back bad money. With so much invested in winning this season, that wasn't tenable.\nSo instead, they took a player who will probably make them better this season. For all of his foibles, James Harden is durable. He's been a better player than Garland this season, and he'll take a significant burden off of Donovan Mitchell's shoulders to create every shot. Big men thrive next to Harden. Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley are about to get some of the easiest shots of their life. Harden is bigger than Garland, so while he may not be a star defender, he's easier to hide in the context of an overall scheme. And, most importantly, he's cheaper. They make roughly the same money this season, but Harden only has next year left on his deal, and it's only partially guaranteed for $13.3 million. Just given his age, he's not going to command the sort of long-term money Garland would. Cleveland can now go for it this year and next and then reset its books in the summer of 2027, when Harden expires and Mitchell's new deal begins.So, yes, in a perfect world, you really shouldn't trade a 26-year-old for a 36-year-old. Under the narrow circumstances that Cleveland found itself in, it's defensible. The Cavaliers simply couldn't score when Mitchell went to the bench. Now they can. They haven't been able to rely on Garland to stay healthy. Harden tends to stay healthy. They're holding their nose and hoping Harden doesn't have another of his playoff collapses, but all things considered, they probably made this year's team better and they got out of a contract they seemed to want no part of paying. Confusing as it looks on paper, it makes enough sense to take the plunge. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Clippers: AAll of those risks that the Cavaliers wanted to avoid with Garland apply to the Clippers. He might not be able to stay healthy. He might be overpaid on his contract. As a league, we might be moving away from small guards as centerpieces of championship teams. But this is an enormously simple calculation. The Clippers entered this week as a Play-In team with the NBA's oldest roster and no control over their next four first-round picks. Their future was hopeless. It was just a matter of when Harden and Kawhi Leonard finally broke down.\nGarland is not the salvation the other Los Angeles team got when it was handed Luka Dončić on a silver platter, but the principle is similar. The Lakers were old and going nowhere. Getting Dončić at least gave them direction, an early-prime player to build around as it figured out how to pivot from the last era into the next one. The Clippers badly needed something like that. Garland is their chance at it, and not only did they acquire him, they managed to get a draft pick in the process. That would have felt unthinkable earlier in the season. It wasn't long ago when we assumed the price for Garland might be, say, a Trey Murphy-esque wing, or a package of several first-round picks. The Clippers got him for an older player who wasn't long for their team anyway.The financial risks to the Clippers are far lighter than they were to the Cavaliers. Los Angeles doesn't have a Mobley or a Mitchell to pay. In fact, Garland is now one of only two players on the roster with a guaranteed contract in the summer of 2027 along with Ivica Zubac, their 28-year-old center. Neither player is equipped to be the best player on a contender, but both would be valuable supporting pieces for whoever that player turns out to be. Los Angeles is fertile recruiting ground. The Clippers will have all of the financial flexibility they need to rebuild their roster. And as time passes -- assuming the Aspiration investigation doesn't lead to a severe punishment -- they'll start to regain access to future draft picks to trade. Eventually, the plan will presumably be to either sign a star to play next to Garland and Zubac or use their draft picks to trade for that player. That might not have been possible without Garland. You typically need some young talent in place to convince stars to play for you.\nSo it might not be the obvious home run the Lakers got in Dončić, but it's about as straightforward a win as the Clippers could have reasonably hoped for. They have a future now, or at least a blueprint to build one. If it goes belly up, so what? The time in which Harden and Leonard could have led them to a championship had long passed. Whether they waived his partially guaranteed contract this summer or let his contract expire fully in 2027, the Clippers weren't keeping much longer anyway. Turning him into someone who might be a cornerstone is an absolute no-brainer.\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt is hard to deny the advantages that Manchester City carry into the second leg of the EFL Cup semifinals – a two-goal lead is a healthy cushion to take into Wednesday's match against Newcastle United, and playing at home can't hurt. City, though, have more than clichés about 2-0 leads to worry about with a cup final within touching distance. Few things seem to be going right for Pep Guardiola's side these days, victory on Wednesday no sure thing for a team that was once the definition of utter dominance.The skid that essentially began with a weeks-long losing streak in the fall of 2024 has not exactly dissipated in the year-plus since, despite City's attempts to change things up. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent on transfer fees and some stylistic changes from Guardiola have not stopped the bleeding just yet, victories slipping out of reach in surprising ways. Sunday's 2-2 draw at Tottenham Hotspur, a game in which they boasted a 2-0 lead at halftime, leaves them with just four wins in their last 10 and a wide range of questions as to why this keeps happening, questions Guardiola does not exactly have answers to.The weirdest thing about City's slump is that it is hard to explain at times, in part because the reimagining of the squad makes sense in a lot of ways. A handful of the players they have signed in the last year address genuine issues like Marc Guehi, the ex-Crystal Palace defender who should help shore up a vulnerable defense. The headlining acts of City's refreshed roster, though, are in attack – summer addition Rayan Cherki and January signing Antonie Semenyo, each of whom have quickly become dependable during an unexpected rough patch.How to watch Manchester City vs. Newcastle United, oddsDate: Wednesday, Feb. 4 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Etihad Stadium -- Manchester, EnglandLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Manchester City -135; Draw +285; Newcastle United +310City are still the Premier League's best attacking side but their offense is overly reliant on Erling Haaland, who runs hot and cold like many strikers do. He still has 20 goals in the league but has just two across all competitions in his last 11, It is not exactly down to a lack of productivity on City's part – the team's expected goals per game average has slipped during Haaland's cold streak to 1.6, but only slightly from their overall season average of 1.8, and they score at roughly the same frequency they always have. Haaland himself, though, is more absent than he was at the start of the season – he has averaged 0.4 expected goals per game in his last 11, down from his season average of 0.7.Cherki and Semenyo have done their best to fill in the gaps, alongside academy product Phil Foden and another summer signing in Tijjani Reijnders. The quartet have jointly scored 29 goals across all competitions – just two more as a group than Haaland on his own, a reminder that an overreliance on a player of his caliber sometimes papers over the cracks. Cherki, Reijnders and Semenyo have picked up the slack during Haaland's cold streak. France international Cherki has quickly become the star of City's show with five goals and three assists in the team's last 11 games, filling in as a dependable goalscorer when Haaland cannot and ensuring his first season with City is off to a strong start despite being sidelined with an injury at the beginning of the season. Semenyo, too, has hit the ground running since joining last month with four goals and one assist to start his City tenure.\"I think it stems from the players,\" Semenyo told CBS Sports Golazo Network's Morning Footy this week. \"The players made me feel very comfortable. They helped me make it feel easier for myself and then you've obviously got the coaches, as well. They're guiding me every day, giving me little tips on improving my game and obviously getting used to the system but it's been very, very easy. Everyone's made it very easy for me to settle in and you have to learn on the go. I mean, I've had to do that practically all my life – my football career, I should say so it's not anything new to me.\"That includes Haaland, even if he joked upon Semenyo's arrival that the ex-Bournemouth player was \"coming for my golden boot.\" The newcomer said his new teammate has been very welcoming, even as a sense of friendly competition begins to define their relationship.\"He's made me feel so comfortable,\" Semenyo said. \"He's a loud character in the changing room, very vocal but he's made me feel the most comfortable, I should say, from day one. Before that clip even came out, he was just saying, 'It's great to have you here' … [We'll] compete for top goalscorer as well so it's nice, friendly competition but I'm glad he's my teammate.\"Even as things go sideways for City in the Premier League, Semenyo is quickly proving his worth while he and Cherki add much-needed dimension to an attack that is sometimes one-note when Haaland does all the work. It is not exactly a foolproof strategy to survive Haaland's slump – they have gone goalless twice in their last 11, their 2-0 loss to Manchester United the most clear example of the Norway international's oversized presence in City's attack.The pair, though, ensure City have a chance in most of their outings, with or without Haaland. Defensive resilience – or a lack thereof – is emerging as the next major area of improvement for Guardiola's side, Guehi merely one step in addressing an issue exacerbated by a batch of injuries. Newcastle will like their chances against a vulnerable City, who are undoubtedly in a funk but in Semenyo and Cherki have the type the players to snap out of this run, at least in the short term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The 2025 NFL season concludes this Sunday when the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots battle in Super Bowl 60. The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world, but not everyone is always excited for this game. Consider the teams and players that came up just short from the Super Bowl.Take the Buffalo Bills for example. They were eliminated from the playoffs after a controversial 33-30 overtime loss to the Denver Broncos in the divisional round. Star quarterback Josh Allen had an uncharacteristic performance, as he committed four turnovers after turning the ball over zero times in his previous six playoff games. With the loss, Allen fell to 8-7 in the postseason. Those eight playoff wins are the most by an NFL quarterback without a Super Bowl appearance. During a recent interview with CBS Sports HQ, Allen revealed that he doesn't usually watch the Super Bowl. However, this year he will be. That's because he wants to root on one of his close friends. \"Throughout the years, it's typically not watching it,\" Allen responded when asked what his Super Bowl Sunday usually looks like. \"I love Sam Darnold. That's one of my good buddies. I wish I could be there in person, [but I'm] still in this boot. But I will be watching, I will be rooting him on, me and my wife. I've spent a lot of time with Sam, and he's a fantastic football player but he's an even greater human being so I'm wishing him the best.\" \nSeahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is without a doubt one of the main storylines for this Super Bowl. Not many expected him to lead Seattle to this kind of success in his first season with the franchise, and he could become the first quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl after playing for five different NFL teams.Darnold is the first quarterback from the 2018 class to start in a Super Bowl. That famous draft class also includes Allen, Baker Mayfield, Josh Rosen and Lamar Jackson. Allen and Darnold were forced to be AFC East rivals at first, as the latter was selected by the New York Jets at No. 3 overall. But even as Darnold left the division and bounced around from team to team, the two quarterbacks remained close. \nAllen hopes to one day be playing on the stage where Darnold will on Sunday. For now, he will root on his buddy. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        If you didn't have access to a calendar, you might've accidentally mistaken the madness that occurred on Tuesday in the NBA as the trade deadline. It all started when the Memphis Grizzlies made a stunning trade that saw star big man Jaren Jackson Jr. go to the Utah Jazz in a package centered around three first-round picks. Later in the day, the Los Angeles Clippers traded James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Darius Garland, swapping star guards in one of the more surprising trades in NBA deadline history. In between all that, Boston added a big man, the Timberwolves dumped Mike Conley's contract and the Pistons sold on former top-five pick Jaden Ivey. And so began the madness, two days before Thursday's official trade deadline (3 p.m. ET). Last year saw one of the most chaotic trade deadlines in league history. Among the players dealt last season before the deadline were Luka Dončić, Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler. This year won't have a Luke stunner, but the name power is creeping up there -- headlined, of course, by Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who appears to have decided he is ready for a change of scenery. \nIf the Bucks indeed deal the two-time NBA MVP, will it be to the Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, or perhaps even a surprise suitor? In short, this year's deadline will revolve around Antetokounmpo.\n        \n            \n                Jaren Jackson Jr. trade grades: Why Grizzlies earn slightly better mark than Jazz\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMore moves are certain to roll in before fans and teams need to set their (trade machines) pencils down until the summer. Here are five storylines to keep an eye on heading into Thursday.Does Giannis get traded?Antetokounmpo is the player dictating the deadline and what happens because how often is a multi-time league MVP available for trade? The Bucks and Antetokounmpo have been dancing around a potential breakup for what seems like years now. If it doesn't happen this week, it appears inevitable that this partnership is heading toward a divorce.\nSo, if the Bucks trade him, where is he going? According to multiple reports, the most likely suitors are the Heat, Timberwolves and Warriors, although the New York Knicks have been mentioned multiple times since last summer. If you want to read about what a potential trade might look like with any of those teams, my colleague Sam Quinn has you covered with mock trades.\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo mock trades: How Knicks, Warriors, more could entice Bucks with wild multi-team deals\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf the Warriors do trade for Antetokounmpo, it would likely mean parting ways with either Draymond Green or Jimmy Butler. ESPN reported on Tuesday that Greenhas been involved in \"active trade conversation\" ahead of Thursday's trade deadline. Green has been with the Warriors for 14 seasons and is the second-longest-tenured player behind Stephen Curry. A Curry/Antetokounmpo pairing would be enticing for basketball fans. If it's Minnesota, it's likely a duo of Anthony Edwards/Antetokounmpo. If it's Miami, that means the Heat would have their frontcourt solidified with Antetokounmpo and Bam Adebayo.We'll find out soon if the Bucks are actually ready to break up with Antetokounmpo. \nWhat's next for the Warriors?If the Warriors don't win the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes, what's next? Golden State is flirting with being in the play-in this spring. The Warriors sit at 27-23 -- good enough for No. 8 in the Western Conference -- ahead of the trade deadline. The Warriors are 3.0 games behind the Lakers for the No. 6 spot in the West.Golden State's season was altered earlier this month when Butler suffered a torn ACL. Without him, the Warriors don't have a bona fide star next to Curry. The reality of the situation is Curry continues to play at an elite level nightly, but without true help it will go down as a lost season. \n        \n            \n                Once-in-a-lifetime pairing: Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo would be a match made in basketball heaven\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe name talked about on this roster as much as anyone (outside of Curry) has been Jonathan Kuminga. The 23-year-old forward signed a two-year deal last summer to return to the franchise after an intense negotiation that came with him being a restricted free agent. As Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. said last month, \"there needs to be demand on the market\" for a trade to happen.\nOne of the only teams that has maintained strong interest in Kuminga is the Sacramento Kings. If Kuminga is on the roster after Thursday, get ready for more rumors and talk in the coming months. Kuminga has a club option for the 2026-27 season for $24.3 million.Grizzlies firesale?The Grizzlies roster that lost in the first round of the 2023 NBA Playoffs to the Lakers as the No. 2 seed in the West looks drastically different than it does now. Dillon Brooks is now a member of the Phoenix Suns and has been a key piece in turning things around this season. Desmond Bane was traded to the Orlando Magic last offseason and went for an incredible haul of draft picks. Jackson was traded to Utah just over 48 hours before the deadline for a package centered around first-round picks.The name to know ahead of the deadline is Ja Morant. The Grizzlies' star point guard could be the next player from that core to depart as Memphis takes the next step toward a full-on rebuild. One suitor for Morant's service could be the Kings. Sacramento has been mentioned as one of the few teams that could get in the \"Morant business\" before the deadline, The Athletic reported on Tuesday.\n\n        \n            \n                Grizzlies trade Jaren Jackson Jr. and others to Jazz for four players, three first-round picks, per reports\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMorant, 26, is averaging 19.5 points, 8.1 assists and 3.3 rebounds in 20 games for Memphis this season. Morant hasn't played since Jan. 21 after suffering a sprained UCL in his left elbow in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks. At the time, Memphis announced that Morant would be re-evaluated in three weeks, which ruled him out until after the NBA trade deadline.If Morant is traded, all eyes will be on the lottery in May. If the season ended today, Memphis would have the ninth-best odds to land No. 1.Who else could be a seller at the deadline?Though we just mentioned them as possible destinations for Morant or Kuminga, the Kings also profile as potential sellers. They have the worst record in the NBA and that's with a veteran-heavy roster headlined by Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Malik Monk and LaVine. Might any of those players get dealt between now and Thursday? W\nThe problem working against Sacramento is the size of all those contracts. Sabonis has two more years on his contract after this season. DeRozan is set to make $25.7 million during the 2026-27 campaign, although only $10 million of that is guaranteed. LaVine has a player option worth nearly $50 million that seems likely to get picked up this summer.\n        \n            \n                Five NBA trade deadline bold predictions: Knicks make a blockbuster, Cavs shake things up, big names stay put\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe most notable reported suitor for Sabonis has been the Raptors. The name that has been widely reported as one who could head back Sacramento's way in a potential deal is RJ Barrett, who has history with current Sacramento general manager Scott Perry. When Perry was the general manager of the Knicks, he drafted Barrett with the No. 3 overall pick in the NBA Draft. The obstacle in a potential deal is that the Raptors would likely need to ship out either Jakob Poeltl or Immanuel Quickley, who have long-term deals well past this season.Buckle up. The fun's just getting started. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Earlier this week, we proposed Giannis Antetokounmpo mock trades for the four teams most aggressively pursuing the two-time MVP: the New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves. The only problem? Their packages were fairly underwhelming. The Warriors really only have picks to offer, and the value of those picks relies on the team falling apart in the coming years. Miami has some picks, but owes a pesky 2027 pick to Charlotte that complicates its offer, and Kel'El Ware doesn't look quite as appealing now as he did a few months ago as a centerpiece player. The Knicks and Wolves need to rope in third, fourth, maybe even fifth teams to generate draft picks for their veterans, because right now, they don't have any.So today, we're taking a different road. We're talking Giannis sleepers. All four of these teams can make better offers than the teams we covered yesterday. Of course, we don't know that they actually would, but our goal today is laying out what possible deals for these teams could look like rather than suggesting that any of these deals is especially likely (though in some cases, there's seemingly a bit of momentum). So let's fire up the trade machine and find Antetokounmpo a new home.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland CavaliersCavaliers receive: Giannis AntetokounmpoNets receive: Dennis Schröder, 2030 first-round pick swap (via Cavaliers), two second-round picks (2028, 2032 via Cavaliers)Bucks receive: Evan Mobley, Lonzo Ball, 2031 first-round pick (via Cavaliers), 2032 first-round swap rights (via Cavaliers)ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on Tuesday that the Cavaliers have indeed made contact with the Bucks about a possible Antetokounmpo deal, and given all of the wild rumors surrounding this team right now, it seems as though anything is possible. Yes, in this world, we're assuming Antetokounmpo is comfortable playing with new Cavalier James Harden despite their long-running feud. Stranger things have happened. The chance to win a title trumps all.\nNow, what are the Nets doing here? Well, despite the De'Andre Hunter trade, the Cavaliers are still around $14 million above the second apron. They need to get below that line to make this possible, because teams above the second apron cannot aggregate salary. So we're giving the Nets an unprotected first-round swap and two second-round picks to take on the Schröder deal. Schröder thrived in Brooklyn last season, so maybe he could be a part of their efforts to get better next season.Really, though, this all comes down to one question: would the Cavaliers trade Evan Mobley for Giannis Antetokounmpo? I'm sure they would have loved to dangle, say, Garland, Jarrett Allen and their meager remaining draft assets, but if that were feasible it probably would have happened, and now that Garland is a Clipper, it's not possible anyway. No, Milwaukee needs Mobley, a 24-year-old All-NBA big man, to entertain a Cleveland offer. The obvious question here: if Antetokounmpo couldn't win with these Bucks, why could Mobley? Well, he couldn't. What the Bucks would really be trading for here is time. Mobley is under contract through 2030. Antetokounmpo is making noise about a trade here and now. The Bucks could get Mobley, tank for a high 2026 pick and then spend a year or two seeing what happens. Maybe they find more wins on the margins like Ryan Rollins and improve. Maybe they flip Myles Turner for assets. Maybe those Cavaliers and Clippers draft assets look better in a few years. Maybe they flip some of their own picks down the line for more help for Mobley. They'd have time to figure it out. That's time Antetokounmpo isn't giving them.\nAnd the Cavaliers? Well, they'd be the most talented team in the Eastern Conference. A starting five of Harden, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylon Tyson, Antetokounmpo and Jarrett Allen would raise some questions about spacing and usage, but good luck stopping five players this good. They'd still have a pretty deep bench with Keon Ellis, Max Strus, Dean Wade and Sam Merrill available as role players. They might need to mix and match lineups a bit to figure out what works, but there's more than enough in this cupboard to not only win the East, but win a championship. If the Cavaliers are all-in on the present, this makes sense. The Garland trade hints that that's their direction, but it doesn't guarantee it. That could just as easily be a signifier of their reluctance to extend Garland for fear of the financial impact it would have on a Mitchell-Mobley core. If their goal is a longer runway, of if they're just really committed to the idea of Mobley as a Cavs lifer, this thing falls apart. It's a question of priority, but with Mitchell's free agency looming in 2027, Cleveland has already been aggressive at this deadline, and Antetokounmpo would probably make them the Eastern Conference favorite.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Portland Trail BlazersTrail Blazers receive: Giannis AntetokounmpoBucks receive: Jerami Grant, Zach Collins, Matisse Thybulle, Scoot Henderson, three first-round picks (more favorable of Bucks and Blazers in 2028, most favorable of Bucks, Celtics and Blazers in 2029, 2031 via Blazers), Blazers renounce swap rights with Bucks in 2030Bulls receive: Kyle Kuzma, Trail Blazers remove protection on the lottery-protected 2026 first-round pick they owe ChicagoThe entire league seemingly wants to use the Blazers as facilitators in an Antetokounmpo trade because Portland controls Milwaukee's first-round picks between 2028 and 2030. Portland has seemingly responded to this by pursuing Antetokounmpo themselves, with Damian Lillard acting as a recruiter. There is no indication that Antetokounmpo would be willing to stay in Portland to this point. If he wants to get moved by Thursday, and therefore retain the ability to extend with a new team in the offseason, this might be the sort of compromise trade he needs to accept. Nothing happens if the Blazers don't believe they can actually keep Antetokounmpo for the long haul.\nNow, let's say Lillard and Jrue Holiday successfully recruit their former teammate to the Pacific Northwest. We still have a lot of work to do. The Bucks would obviously want their picks back. I've laid out in detail the complications that come with getting them here, but here's the short version: the Blazers can't give the Bucks their 2028 selection back without some cooperation from the Bulls, who have a lottery-protected 2026 Blazers pick. So here's our solution: Portland removes the protection on that pick, ensuring the Bulls get it and Portland has access to its 2028 pick which it can trade to Milwaukee with those swap rights attached. In return for the lottery upside and the certainty of getting the pick this season, the Bulls agree to turn the expiring Collins contract into one more year of Kuzma money. Chicago has signaled a willingness to eat money for draft picks this deadline, so that sort of deal tracks.So where does all of this leave the Bucks? Well, they still wouldn't have a pick in 2027, but they'd regain control over their picks in 2028, 2029 and 2030 with a little bit of added upside coming from that \"most favorable\" language. The Blazers would throw in one more pick in 2031 to push it over the top, but that would allow them to keep most of the young talent they'd want to pair with Antetokounmpo rather than give up to get him. Milwaukee would get one very interesting young prospect, though, in recent No. 3 pick Scoot Henderson. Things haven't worked out for him in Portland, but the Bucks actually present a very interesting situation for him. They're loaded with shooting and should have basically no pressure to win for the next few years. That's a great environment for a fast guard who needs shots and touches to develop. The other players are just matching money. The bulk of the value comes in regaining the ability to tank in the near future.\nWhen the dust settles here, the Blazers will have expended most of their pick capital, essentially four picks and one very valuable swap, to secure Antetokounmpo while keeping the bulk of its young core intact. There would certainly be questions here. For instance, is Lillard comfortable coming off of the bench next season behind Holiday and Shaedon Sharpe? How would Antetokounmpo fit on a team that currently has the lowest 3-point percentage in the NBA? What sort of follow-up moves would be needed? In reality, the Blazers would probably need a transaction cycle or two to figure out the team around Giannis. But when does Portland ever have a chance to get someone this good? If he's willing to stay in Portland, the Blazers have to consider going for him.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Toronto RaptorsRaptors receive: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday, Myles TurnerTrail Blazers receive: Bobby Portis, Gradey Dick, Ja'Kobe Walter, 2028 first-round pick (via Raptors)Bucks receive: Scottie Barnes, Immanuel Quickley, Jakob Poeltl, Ochai Agbaji, Collin Murray-Boyles, 2026 first-round pick (via Raptors)There has not been any indication whatsoever that the Raptors are willing to trade Barnes. The Raptors have just been linked to every big name on the market, and they've been frequently connected to Antetokounmpo as a sleeper, so we're gaming out what it would take. Toronto's picks, with Barnes on the team, aren't valuable enough to get Giannis, so this is the only realistic path. So join us as we venture into Cuckoo Bananas Land.So, what's Portland doing here? Well, we need to entice Antetokounmpo into actually staying in Toronto, and the Raptors without Barnes don't have a team that can do that. So that's why we're bringing in Holiday, to make the Raptors attractive enough to get an extension from Antetokounmpo. Portland has the leverage here to demand two interesting young players and a good first-round pick for its participation.\nNow that that's settled, we move on to Milwaukee's end of the equation. Much like the Cleveland scenario, the Bucks would have to eschew most of the draft value in this trade for the sake of getting an All-Star in his mid-20s. The appeal of Barnes is similar to the appeal of Mobley: they both buy the Bucks time to chart a new course. The Bucks get even less draft value here than they did in the Cleveland deal, but that's made up for by the addition of Murray-Boyles, the No. 9 pick in last year's draft and an extremely promising young defender.Toronto just doesn't have enough shooting to make a trade like this without Turner's inclusion. With him? They're suddenly an absolutely fascinating team: Antetokounmpo, a defense-first point guard in Holiday, two big wings in RJ Barrett and Brandon Ingram, and Turner as the spacing center to round the team out. The formula here would be eerily similar the 2021 Bucks championship team, with Ingram as the late-clock shot-maker on the wings. The Raptors would notably keep their more valuable, deep future first-round picks in 2030 and 2032 to potentially use to tinker with the supporting cast (there's very limited depth here after making such a big trade), but the top of the roster looks strong.Now, again, this isn't realistic. The Raptors almost certainly won't trade Barnes. But honestly, a Barnes-Antetokounmpo pairing, given neither is an especially consistent shooter, would probably be a bit clunky anyway. The Raptors would be justified in refusing the trade Barnes even for Giannis. He's a very valuable player who's significantly younger. But if they saw a chance to win it all right now, one they don't currently have, well, it's worth the conversation at least, even if it's not an especially realistic one.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia 76ers76ers receive: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Herb JonesPelicans receive: Kelly Oubre Jr., Amir Coffey, two first-round picks (2028 via Clippers, 2032 via 76ers)Bucks receive: Paul George, VJ Edgecombe, Andre DrummondMuch like the Raptors trade, there is no indication whatsoever that the 76ers would trade Edgecombe. There's even reporting that the Sixers won't entertain an Edgecomb deal. Frankly, I'm afraid Philadelphia fans are going to start whipping snowballs at me for even mentioning the idea. But there has been reporting suggesting that Antetokounmpo would be interested in the 76ers, so we're mapping out what it would look like. And what it would look like, simply, is Edgecombe. That's it. Philadelphia would have to match money, of course, so George goes into the deal too. But Edgecombe is a future star in the first year of a rookie deal. Milwaukee could not possibly do better than that, so that's all they get.Where this gets more interesting is in the broader implications of a roster-build with Giannis. If the 76ers are giving up Edgecombe, they're all-in on this season. And if they're all-in on this season, that means they're going to have to round out this year's roster using draft picks. There isn't enough perimeter defense on this team. We're turning to the Pelicans, with Herb Jones on a team-friendly contract, to change that.New Orleans reportedly wants a haul of picks for Jones. The Pelicans get two here, but they're two great ones. The first is unprotected from the Clippers, who are in a state of flux as they weigh possible James Harden deals. The second is all the way in 2032. Maxey may be relatively young, but Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid are not. The 76ers will be a very different team in 2032 if they make this trade. If anything, this might even be an overpay on Philadelphia's part, but it would be worthwhile for the final product if the only goal is to win a championship as soon as possible.\nThat would be a starting five of Maxey, Quentin Grimes, Jones, Antetokounmpo and the resurgent Embiid. There would certainly be some fit issues. Antetokounmpo and Embiid occupy similar spaces on the floor. Jones is an inconsistent shooter, though to be fair, he's never had shots as open as the ones he'd get on this team. But man, the talent here is untouchable. If, and since we're talking about Philadelphia, it's an absolutely enormous-sized \"if,\" they can stay healthy, they're winning the East running away.But again, this is fantasy land. Considering all it took to get Edgecombe to Philadelphia, the 76ers likely wouldn't trade for him basically anything. They have a long runway with Maxey, Edgecombe and those Clippers picks looming in the years to come. Daryl Morey obviously has a history of making all-in trades, but this probably isn't one he'd really consider. Edgecombe is too good, too young and too cheap to trade even for Giannis.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFor the first three months of the 2025-26 NHL season, the Colorado Avalanche were on a pace that logically was not sustainable. They've proven just that this month.The Avalanche earned at least one point in 38 of their first 40 games this campaign, improving to 31-2-7 with a 5-3 triumph over the Carolina Hurricanes in their first game in January. They've gone 5-7-2 since, losing three of their four contests in Week 17 as their lead in the race for the President's Trophy has shrunk to five points.Five of those nine defeats came at home, where Colorado went 17-0-2 prior to the 2026 calendar year. The club has one more game at Ball Arena -- and overall -- before the NHL begins its 19-day break for the 2026 Winter Olympics.While the Avalanche had a week they'd like to forget, two teams had fantastic seven-day stretches and now are nipping at their heels. The Minnesota Wild and Dallas Stars both won all four of their games and enter Week 18 trailing Colorado in the league standings by only five and six points, respectively.Several other clubs were perfect in Week 17, with the Columbus Blue Jackets, Seattle Kraken and Ottawa Senators all going 3-0-0 and the Tampa Bay Lightning winning both of their contests. Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens posted a 3-0-1 record, and the Hurricanes and Boston Bruins each went 2-0-1.Only two squads had a worse time than Colorado last week, as the Florida Panthers suffered four regulation losses to drop out of the top 10 ratings and the New York Rangers were 0-3-0. The Vegas Golden Knights were the only other team that failed to get in the win column, but they earned two points by losing once in overtime and once in a shootout.Each week during the season I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings entering Week 18 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 18 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (1-3-0 in Week 17; 36-9-9 overall)The Avalanche began last week with back-to-back road losses against the Senators and Canadiens, giving them setbacks in six of eight contests (2-4-2). They bounced back with a 5-0 triumph over the Detroit Red Wings to break even on their four-game trek but wound up splitting the home-and-home series as they were shut out themselves 2-0 at Ball Arena on Monday. Nathan MacKinnon recorded two goals and an assist in Colorado's lone victory but was kept off the scoresheet in each defeat and is four points behind Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid, who leads the NHL with 95. Two-time Norris Trophy winner Cale Makar had an even more uneventful week as he failed to record a point. The 27-year-old enters Week 18 with his longest drought since a four-gamer from Jan. 6-11, 2025. Along with Ross Colton, Parker Kelly also scored twice last week and has converted in every other contest over his last eight.2. Tampa Bay Lightning (2-0-0; 35-14-4)Tampa Bay kept rolling in Week 17, cruising past the Winnipeg Jets 4-1 at home before recording an historic 6-5 shootout victory over the Bruins at Raymond James Stadium on Sunday in this season's installment of the NHL Stadium Series. The Lightning overcame a four-goal deficit for the first time in franchise history in that contest as Boston was ahead 5-1 midway through the second period before imploding. It was the eighth consecutive home win for Tampa Bay, which has gone 17-1-1 over its last 19 overall games. Two-time defending Art Ross Trophy winner and three-time overall recipient Nikita Kucherov is riding an eight-game point streak and has landed on the scoresheet in 18 of his last 19 outings. The 32-year-old Russian right wing also is in the midst of a four-game multi-point run as he had a goal and an assist against Winnipeg before netting a tally and setting up three others versus Boston. Meanwhile, defenseman Darren Raddysh's career season continued as the 29-year-old racked up two goals and three assists last week. Raddysh, who enters Week 18 with a four-game goal-scoring streak, already has set personal bests this campaign with 16 tallies, 33 assists and 49 points.3. Dallas Stars (4-0-0; 33-14-9)The Stars began last week with a perfect three-game road trip before ending it with their fifth consecutive overall victory and sixth in seven games, a 4-3 overtime triumph over the Jets. Defenseman Thomas Harley was impressive as he scored with 1:07 remaining in the third period last Tuesday to give Dallas a 4-3 win against the Blues in St. Louis, converted a power-play opportunity in a 3-2 victory over the Utah Mammoth on Saturday and netted the overtime winner versus Winnipeg two days later. Matt Duchene tallied in each game during Dallas' trek, including twice at St. Louis, to extend his goal-scoring streak to four contests and notched a pair of assists against the Jets. Mikko Rantanen got on the scoresheet in all four Week 17 games, collecting a goal and four assists, captain Jamie Benn set up five tallies and Sam Steel and blue-liner Miro Heiskanen recorded four assists apiece.4. Minnesota Wild (4-0-0; 33-14-10)With their four victories in Week 17, the Wild have earned points in six straight games (5-0-1) and eight of their last nine (7-1-1). Three players contributed offensively in all four wins, with Matt Boldy scoring a goal and setting up four others, Joel Eriksson Ek registering three tallies and three assists and defenseman Quinn Hughes amassing a goal and six assists. Boldy is in the midst of a six-game point streak (two goals, six assists), Eriksson Ek has netted a tally in four of his last five outings and Hughes has set up 14 goals during his nine-game assist streak while also converting twice in that span. Kirill Kaprizov has scored four times over his last three contests and posted multi-point performances in seven of his past nine outings.5. Carolina Hurricanes (2-0-1; 34-15-6)Much like the Lightning, the Hurricanes have stormed to the top of the Eastern Conference are riding an eight-game point streak (6-0-2) and have gone 10-1-3 over the last 14 contests. They began last week with a 5-4 triumph over Mammoth -- scoring three times in the final 1:59 of the third period, with captain Jordan Staal netting the winning goal with 30 seconds remaining. Carolina then squandered a three-goal lead in a 4-3 overtime loss to the Washington Capitals and let a two-goal advantage slip away before edging the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 in OT. Defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere collected three goals and three assists in Week 17, while Andrei Svechnikov had two of each. Sebastian Aho appears to have broken out of his slump as he ended his 12-game drought with a tally against the Capitals and converted 1:25 into overtime versus the Kings.6. Buffalo Sabres (3-1-0; 32-18-5)The Sabres just might be for real as they won three of their four games last week. Since their three-game losing streak in early December, they've gone 21-4-1 over their last 26 contests. Alex Lyon has won 11 of his last 12 decisions, setting the franchise record with 10 consecutive victories during the stretch, and defenseman Rasmus Dahlin has landed on the scoresheet in 11 of his last 12 outings. Dahlin matched a career high with five points in a 7-4 triumph over the Toronto Maple Leafs last Tuesday, registering his first NHL hat trick in the contest. Two days later, Alex Tuch recorded his fourth career hat trick as Buffalo defeated Los Angeles 4-1. The 29-year-old right wing hasn't gone back-to-back games without a point since Dec. 20-21, amassing 11 goals and eight assists over his last 20 outings. 7. Montreal Canadiens (3-0-1; 31-17-8)Montreal was less than 13 minutes away from a perfect week as it defeated Vegas, Colorado and Buffalo before taking a 3-2 lead against Minnesota 12 seconds into the third period on Monday. However, the club allowed the tying goal with 12:55 remaining and fell 4-3 in overtime. Defenseman Noah Dobson got on the scoresheet in all four games for the Canadiens, notching a goal and four assists, while Nick Suzuki increased his team-leading point total to 65 with two tallies and four assists. The 26-year-old Suzuki has picked up at least one point in eight of his last nine outings and hasn't been blanked in consecutive contests since Nov. 11 and 13.8. Detroit Red Wings (1-2-1; 33-18-6)The Red Wings fell eight spots in the ratings due to their rough week. They scored a total of one goal in regulation losses to Los Angeles and Colorado, and they were fortunate to earn a point in their shootout defeat against Washington as they tallied twice in the final 1:40 of the third period. Alex DeBrincat was Detroit's top offensive producer in Week 17 as he netted three tallies and set up another. The 28-year-old right wing scored in the team's 2-0 triumph over the Avalanche on Monday to reach the 30-goal plateau for the second straight campaign and fifth time in his nine-season NHL career. 9. Boston Bruins (2-0-1; 32-20-4)The Bruins enter Week 18 with a six-game point streak and have gone 12-2-3 over their last 17 contests. They squandered a two-goal lead before defeating the Nashville Predators 3-2 in overtime last Tuesday and cruised past the Philadelphia Flyers 6-3 but were unable to hold a four-goal advantage in Sunday's Stadium Series matchup against Tampa Bay and fell 6-5 in a shootout. Morgan Geekie collected five points (three goals, two assists) last week while defensemen Charlie McAvoy and Jonathan Aspirot both notched four assists. The 27-year-old Geekie is riding a seven-game point streak during which he has netted seven tallies and set up four others. Meanwhile, McAvoy has racked up a goal and eight assists during his six-game run.10. Pittsburgh Penguins (2-1-0; 28-15-11)Pittsburgh began last week with victories over the Chicago Blackhawks and New York Rangers -- scoring six goals in each triumph -- but dropped a 3-2 decision to the Senators on Monday, ending its six-game winning streak and nine-game point run (7-0-2). Captain Sidney Crosby has a quiet Week 17, recording just one assist, but Anthony Mantha scored three goals and set up two others. Connor Dewar and Noel Acciari each registered two goals and two assists, while Evgeni Malkin had an assist in each of the Penguins' three contests to extend his point streak to six games (three goals, five assists). A two-time Art Ross Trophy winner, the 39-year-old Malkin has landed on the scoresheet in 13 of his last 15 contests, collecting seven goals and 12 assists in that span. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        James Harden is ready to move on. That tracks. Given his history, no one should be surprised. And yet somehow the Clippers seemed surprised.On Monday evening, news broke that the Clippers were talking to the Cavaliers. By Tuesday, reports had those discussions accelerating, with the idea being a Harden for Darius Garland swap in some form. Sure. There is a cycle to these things for Harden. Every few years something happens in one location that makes him want to move on to another location, and then he goes to that new place and likes it fine until he doesn't. The Clippers were evidently unfamiliar with that game.Told of Harden's pending departure, Kawhi Leonard said \"that's a surprise.\" John Collins went further.\nOh, John. John, John, John, John…JOHN. To be so innocent and unsuspecting. For the moment we'll put aside the part where Collins is shocked that Harden's well-known wandering eye has once again cast his sights elsewhere. But it's hard to blame the guy for being disappointed. As he mentioned, after a rough start, the Clippers have been considerably better of late. Since December 20, they're 17-5. That's the best mark in the NBA -- but apparently still not good enough for Harden.\nThere could be any number of reasons for Harden seeking this latest divorce, but the most likely catalyst is money. Harden has a player option for next season at $42.3 million. He's 36 years old. The man would almost certainly like to decline that and sign a deal with more years that will carry him into retirement. The Clippers are perhaps unwilling to go that route even though Harden has played quality basketball in Los Angeles and put up good numbers. The roster is ancient and the Clippers surely know this era will be over sooner than later. It's also possible that, despite the Clippers playing well over the last month and a half, Harden is reading the tea leaves on the still-pending Kawhi Leonard/Aspiration cap circumvention investigation and decided to get out while the getting is good. \n        \n            \n                If the Clippers are trading James Harden, they might as well explore Kawhi Leonard deals too\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut as we've learned, getting out is always good for Harden. It's standard operating procedure. Which is part of what makes John Collins being \"shocked\" about Harden wanting to leave L.A. so, well, shocking. When Harden decided his time was up in Houston, he famously showed up looking bloated. And then off he went to Brooklyn, where he reunited with Kevin Durant and he was happy -- until he wasn't. That led to him reconnecting with his good friend Daryl Morey and moving to Philly, where the Sixers general manager remained his good friend -- until he wasn't. The Philly uncoupling was an all-timer even for Harden. While in China in front of some confused children he called Morey a liar and vowed to never play for the Sixers again.\nAnd then for good measure he threw a party complete with signs that read \"Daryl Morey is a liar.\" Why opt for subtlety and diplomacy when you can get an entire club to say it with their whole chest?\nAnd so Harden left Philly, and now he is poised to leave Los Angeles and then who knows maybe he'll leave Cleveland and somewhere else before he's done. It's how his career has gone because it's how he wants it to go. That is his prerogative, though it's curious that team after team keeps opting into the James Harden For a Limited Time Only Experience. You'd expect by now that the next team would see how it worked out for all the other organizations before them and that would give them pause. As so many jokers rightly pointed out on social media, it's the Arrested Development meme where all the other people in the same situation had been deluding themselves -- but it might work for us. It's been an uneven year for the Cavs. They got off to a slow start and have only lately started to stabilize. Donovan Mitchell has been asked to do a lot of heavy lifting. There have been injuries to Evan Mobley who is dealing with a calf issue and Garland, who has played just 26 games and remains out with a right toe sprain. Garland is a decade younger than Harden but maybe the Cavs don't think they can wait for him to fully mend and once again play like the two-time All-Star he was in previous seasons. Maybe Cleveland looks at the Eastern Conference and, after a disappointing playoff exit last postseason, thinks it's worth shaking up the roster in the hopes of making a run. OK. There's a certain logic to that. It's harder to land on the answer being the itinerant, aging, high-usage guard who wants more money please and thank you and will surely be scoping out the exits as soon as he walks in the entrance. \nIf and when Harden moves on, it would be his fifth team in five years. The first four didn't win anything. But hey, Harden is talented and sometimes that can be blinding. After the Clippers lost to the Sixers on Monday -- a game that Harden did not play in for obvious reasons -- Clippers head coach Ty Lue was asked about the situation and said \"who wouldn't want James Harden?\" Considering [waives hand in the direction of the teams Harden has left in his wake], who would? \n            ",

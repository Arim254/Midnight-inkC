Buffalo leads the league in total offense, averaging 395.8 yards per game. Quarterback Josh Allen has been spectacular this season, and he's completing 70.4% of his passes for 1,217 yards, nine touchdowns and just two interceptions. He's also racked up 212 rushing yards on 40 carries and three scores. The model projects the Bills to win in 78% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 68.55%, making this a valuable favorite to include with a pair of underdog picks in the model's Monday DraftKings parlay.Bears (+205) to defeat the CommandersChicago had an additional week to prepare for Washington while coming off a bye, and the model projects that to play to the Bears' advantage on Monday. After a slow start with two losses, largely due to defensive struggles with Chicago allowing 39.5 ppg over its first two contests, the Bears entered the bye week off back-to-back victories as the underdog in both contests. The Bears defeated the Cowboys, 31-14, in Week 3, followed by a 25-24 win over the Raiders. Chicago has the No. 10 scoring offense (25.3 ppg) this season. The model projects the Bears to win in 37% of simulations, however, with the implied odds of +205 signaling a 32.8% chance of victory, the model sees solid value in taking the shot of Chicago upsetting Washington.Brewers (+128) to defeat the DodgersThe Brewers are using the element of surprise to their advantage, not naming a Game 1 starter as of Monday morning, coming off their five-game series victory over the Cubs on Saturday. Milwaukee, which had the best record in baseball at 97-65 this season, knocked off the Cubs, 3-1, on Saturday to improve to 3-0 at home this postseason. The Brewers went 52-29 at home this season, and they will host the Dodgers on Monday. Regardless of who starts for the Brewers, they have the luxury of one of the top bullpens in baseball, ranking sixth in bullpen ERA (3.63) this season. The Brewers also had the No. 4 scoring offense (4.96 runs per game) this season. The model projects Milwaukee to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing strong plus-money value for Monday.Want more NFL picks for Monday Night Football and MLB picks?You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

Auburn's Hugh Freeze and Florida's Billy Napier are both firmly on the hot seat after slow starts, and after the Tigers lost in gutting fashion on Saturday night to Georgia with another woeful offensive showing in a game Freeze desperately needed to win, his seat got even hotter. With plenty of other power conference programs making midseason changes, the natural question for Auburn was whether they'd follow suit. Auburn athletic director John Cohen was asked exactly that by AL.com's Peter Rauterkaus on Monday and offered a lukewarm vote of confidence in return. Cohen said it's \"not my expectation at this point\" to make a coaching change, but added that he'll \"never say never\" and offered this gem of a quote comparing Freeze to a car that sometimes doesn't start. \n\"I don't know if I'm going to walk outside and my car is going to start or not, I think it is,\" Cohen said. \"I have an expectation it will. But if my car doesn't start enough, then I will evaluate that and make decisions about my car. But that's not my expectation at this point about our football program.\"That's not exactly a ringing endorsement of Freeze, and Cohen leaves the door open for Auburn to make a change if the Tigers don't come to life in the second half of the season. While Freeze's $15.4 million buyout pales in comparison to the $50+ million Penn State shelled out to get rid of Franklin, it's still a sizable figure that makes it a tough decision, especially with Bryan Harsin's buyout still on the books. That said, if the program doesn't show signs of progress and the offense -- which is supposed to be Freeze's strength -- looks as toothless as it has been to start this season, it's hard to envision him being back in 2026.\nSo, for any Auburn fans hoping for a coaching change, they might just need a few more failures to start for Cohen and the Tigers to make that re-evaluation. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Ace Bailey, or at least his former representation, seemingly did everything possible to not get drafted by the Utah Jazz. Bailey reportedly had \"preferred\" destinations which may or may not have influenced a few teams that were in position to take him in June's draft. But Utah decided the talent was too great to pass up -- even against the looming threat of Bailey not reporting to camp or just being a general malcontent -- and took him with the No. 5 overall pick. So far, this looks to have been a very smart decision. For starters, there have been nothing but positive reports about Bailey's attitude. Teammate Kyle Anderson has called Bailey's positivity \"infectious,\" while coach Will Hardy has praised the 19-year-old's \"willingness to ask questions\" and ability to \"see the game and learn on the fly.\"With the obvious qualifier that we're talking about preseason basketball, and just two games at that, Bailey has looked extraordinary on the court so far. Over 70 minutes against the Rockets and Spurs, Bailey has put up 45 points on 19-of-29 shooting. Impressive numbers, obviously. But it's the way those shots are coming, within what is clearly a concerted effort on the part of the Jazz to put Bailey in his most optimal scoring positions, that is putting to bed what was one of the universal concerns about his game in college. \nThat concern was that his offense came very hard. Everything was contested. Part of this was because Rutgers, outside of No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper, didn't have anyone capable of drawing defensive attention away from Bailey. But it was also a problem that Bailey was so bothered by the pressure he did face. Now, when we say bothered, it doesn't mean he couldn't score against pressure. He could. And he can. Bailey's ability to bail himself out with tough shots was perhaps the biggest feather in his draft cap. But in the NBA, making tough shots off whirling spins into mid-range fades cannot be the first page of your survival guide. Sustained, efficient scoring only happens when you are operating in breathable enough airspace to access consistently clean looks.  If you can't cleanly and consistently create that space for yourself, via your own handle (which is something we know Bailey has thus far struggled to do, as evidenced by his alarmingly high turnover rate against pressure in college), then it has to be created for you. And that's what the Jazz are doing for Bailey. \nRather than asking him to start from a stationary position and create advantages in isolation, the Jazz are putting Bailey on the move so that by the time he catches the ball he is either already in, or quickly moving toward, open space. From there, he only requires one or two pressure-free dribbles to get right into a clean shot. This approach was on beautiful display in Bailey's preseason debut against the Rockets. \nIn Game 2, it was more of the same against the Spurs. \nWhat you'll notice is that in all those buckets, only one came out of isolation (and even in that one he got to his spot at the elbow with exquisite efficiency and footwork, requiring just three dribbles punctuated by a luscious spin move). In fact, Bailey has needed just 28 total dribbles to get off his 29 preseason shots so far. \nYou don't have to be a genius to do the math here. That's fewer than one dribble per shot. That is prime Klay Thompson stuff. Bailey isn't the all-time distant threat Thompson is and he's a better athlete, but the common theme between the two is that they're at their best when they're catching balls on the move rather than starting from scratch. Bailey may well evolve as an individual creator (in fact, he almost certainly will), and when he does it should allow him to get to the rim and free-throw line more. Some people are already saying they see a young T-Mac, which is lofty but perhaps not unwarranted. But for now, Bailey is clearly most comfortable as a mid-range scorer on minimal dribbling (a more athletic Rip Hamilton should have everyone in Utah very excited), and it cannot be overstated how smart it is that the Jazz are positioning him in accordance with that talent until the rest of his arsenal comes around. \n            ",

They'll have their chance to advance here, but they have to deal with a hungry Blue Jays team.Mariners vs. Blue Jays scheduleDateStart time/scoreTVLive streamGame 1Sun., Oct. 12SEA 3, TOR 1FoxfuboGame 2Mon., Oct. 13SEA 10, TOR 3FoxfuboGame 3Weds., Oct. 158:08 p.m. ETFS1fuboGame 4Thurs., Oct. 168:33 p.m. ETFS1fuboGame 5 (if nec.)Fri., Oct. 176:08 p.m. ETFS1fuboGame 6 (if nec.)Sun., Oct. 198:03 p.m. ETFS1fuboGame 7 (if nec.)Mon., Oct. 208:08 p.m. ETFoxfuboMariners vs. Blue Jays: Game 3 infoTime: 8:08 p.m. ET | Date: Wednesday, Oct. 15Location: T-Mobile Park -- Seattle, Wash.TV channel: FS1 | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Starting pitchers: RHP George Kirby (SEA) vs. RHP Shane Bieber (TOR)Odds: Blue Jays +118, Mariners -143 (via DraftKings)\nGame 3 storylinesMariners: Heading home with a 2-0 series lead is the stuff dreams are made of for this Mariners club.

Just three months ago, Wilson was rewarded with a four-year, $130 million extension that includes $90 million guaranteed. \nWith Wilson sidelined, expect Josh Reynolds, Tyler Johnson, Allen Lazard and Arian Smith to receive an uptick in work.

    "body": "\n        Leave it to the common sense-defying 2025 Brewers to turn a 404-foot fly ball into a double play. In Game 1 of the NLCS on Monday night (LA 2, MIL 1), Milwaukee turned Max Muncy's rocket to the center field wall into force outs at home plate and third base to escape a bases-loaded jam and keep the game scoreless. The Dodgers squared up Quinn Priester pretty well all inning and walked away with nothing.The scene: L.A. had the bases loaded with one out when Muncy hit a ball to the wall in center. Sal Frelick went up for the catch and the ball clanked out of his glove, hit the wall, then was caught on the way back down. Because the ball hit the wall before the catch, it's in play and not an out. Left field umpire Chad Fairchild correctly signaled \"no catch\" all the way.Amid the confusion, all three Dodgers baserunners held up, which gave the Brewers enough time to get the force out at the plate. Catcher William Contreras then jogged down to third base to get the force out there, ending the inning. Here's the play:\nTeoscar Hernández, the runner at third base, made the biggest mistake. He's tagging up on the play, as he should have, but even if he was unsure the catch was made cleanly, he has to break for home as soon as Frelick has the ball in his glove. Instead, Hernández waited long enough to go home that he was forced out. Will Smith, the runner at second, never advanced to third and was also forced out.\"It happened fast.  I didn't know he didn't catch it, to be quite  honest,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"We go over that rule.  Teo knows the rule.  I think right there  he had just a little bit of a brain fart, appreciating that when it  does hit the glove you can tag there.  But then he tagged, did it  correctly, then saw he didn't catch it, he went back.  That was the  mistake. But he owned it.  And after that there's nothing else you can do about it.\"The Dodgers challenged the play, hoping to get at least one of the force outs overturned, but no luck. \n\"I just wanted clarity ... They nailed it,\" Roberts said. Officially, it goes down as an 8-6-2 grounded into double play. Yes, \"grounded\" into a double play. Baseball scoring can be weird like that sometimes. Rule 5.09(a)(1) covers catching the ball. Here's the rule:A catch is the act of a fielder in getting secure possession  in his hand or glove of a ball in flight and firmly holding it;  providing he does not use his cap, protector, pocket or any other part  of his uniform in getting possession. It is not a catch, however, if  simultaneously or immediately following his contact with the ball, he  collides with a player, or with a wall, or if he falls down, and as a  result of such collision or falling, drops the ball.Frelick made contact with the ball before it hit the wall, negating the catch. Catching the ball on the way down was just a stroke of good luck (or nice defense) by Frelick. It did not result in an out. Once the ball hit the wall, it was a base hit for Muncy, and the runners had to advance. They didn't, and the Brewers turned an unconventional inning-ending double play.\"Sal caught it, then it touched the wall. A baserunner got confused, and we got it in as quickly as possible, made the play at the plate. And heads-up, William got the out at third,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said postgame. \"I mean, it's very unusual. It's tough for the baserunner to figure out what happened, but it's one of those plays in baseball. We got very fortunate there.\"Lost in the craziness: The Dodgers hit Priester well that inning. Hernández walked, Freddie Freeman hit a rocket to left field that Isaac Collins had to jump to catch, Smith and Tommy Edman singled, then Muncy hit a ball to the top of the wall in center. Priester and the Brewers are fortunate to escape that inning without a run scoring.\nThe double play ultimately was not costly as the Dodgers survived a bases-loaded scare in the ninth inning to take Game 1. Historically, the team that wins Game 1 of a best-of-seven has gone on to win the series 65% of the time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Tennessee Titans made a necessary change on Monday, firing coach Brian Callahan after a 1-5 start to the season. Frankly, the move had to be made given how the team had looked under Callahan both during this dreadful start and his entire 4-19 tenure with the organization. The offense, Callahan's supposed calling card, was a mess for his whole time at the helm. Tennessee ranked 31st in yards and 29th in points during his tenure, as well as 31st in TruMedia's EPA per play. This season they were even worse, checking in last in yards per game, second-to-last in points per game and last in EPA per play. They were a bad passing offense and only a marginally better rushing offense in each season. They looked lost, and that was true whether it was Will Levis or Mason Rudolph or Cam Ward at quarterback, and whether Callahan himself was calling plays as he did through Week 3 of this season or whether it was quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree, to whom he ceded that responsibility for Weeks 4 through 6. An offensive coach whose offense looks terrible is always going to be on this ice to begin with. When he then gives up play-calling and takes on more of a CEO-type role, his other attributes come under more scrutiny. And somehow, Callahan's game management strategies might have been even worse than the offense. He was conservative to a fault at almost all times, and he directly cost his team points in at least two games this season. \nAgainst Denver in Week 1, with 47 seconds remaining in the half, Callahan called three consecutive pass plays inside his own 10-yard line. The team seemingly did not know the play on the first pass and the next two each fell incomplete and the Titans gave the ball back to the Broncos. It did not take them long to score a touchdown. Instead of holding a surprising lead at the break, the Titans tailed, and they wouldn't come back. Callahan also seemingly didn't know the rule that having an elbow down inbounds on a catch attempt was the same as getting two feet down, and he failed to challenge a catch by Elic Ayomanor in that same game. He claimed afterward to have misspoke, but he still failed to realize the potential for a big gain in real time. In a close contest, that could have helped his team stage a comeback or even avoid going down in the first place. Two weeks later, the Titans had a chance to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the 39-yard line against the Colts. Callahan even had time to think about it because the Colts called a timeout. But even after that, he was unsure of what to do and called a timeout himself. He elected for the field goal instead of going for it, but the Titans didn't get the ball snapped in time and took a delay of game penalty. Joe Slye missed from 62 yards out and left enough time on the clock for Indy to drive for a field goal of its own. \nBut we're not necessarily here to talk about the faults of Callahan alone. We're here because the Titans are now stuck in a bad cycle -- one where their coach and their general manager and their quarterback are not aligned in terms of the time they came to the organization. And it's a cycle they've been stuck in for a while now. \n        \n            \n                Titans fire Brian Callahan: Kliff Kingsbury, Matt Nagy among coaching candidates to watch\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs NFL Media's Greg Rosenthal noted, the Titans in 2022 fired former general manager Jon Robinson amidst an alleged power struggle with then-coach Mike Vrabel. The team hired Ran Carthon to take his place, but it was Vrabel who seemingly had the power in the organization at first. That only lasted until 2024, when the team fired Vrabel amidst an alleged power struggle with Carthon. They hired Callahan in Vrabel's place, only to then fire Carthon following last season. With Callahan still at the helm, the Titans hired Mike Borgonzi as their new GM, but now Callahan is gone as well.During this time, the Titans have also been cycling through quarterbacks. It was Ryan Tannehill under center for much of the Vrabel era, but injuries and ineffectiveness led to the team drafting potential successors in both Malik Willis and Levis. Willis never caught on, but Levis was given the chance to start in 2023. He didn't fare all that well, and then Vrabel was gone at the end of the year. Callahan took the job with a quarterback already in place, but then Levis was a disaster and was benched in favor of Rudolph. \nThe Titans landed the No. 1 overall pick, which they used on Ward. He's struggled to start his rookie year as the team has failed to put him in position to succeed due to horrific offensive line play, copious amounts of drops and a system that provides no easy answers, and he hasn't been the type of rising tide that lifts all boats that some other rookies have been in recent years. But now the coach that drafted Ward is gone, too, which means that whomever the Titans hire next will also not have drafted the quarterback that he's asked to develop.Add it all up and you begin to see a disturbing pattern: there's no alignment of timelines for the arguably the three most important figures in the organization. Robinson hired Vrabel, but Vrabel outlasted him into the Carthon era. Carthon didn't hire Vrabel, but outlasted him and began the Callahan era. Carthon hired Callahan, but Callahan outlasted him into the Borgonzi era. And now Borgonzi will have to hire a new head coach after just one season on the job. This isn't the way it's supposed to be -- at least not unless one general manager or coach is there year after year because he is so successful, and the other position is changing over. You're also not supposed to have multiple coaches beginning their tenures with a starting quarterback already in place -- at least not unless you know that quarterback is your guy and you're simply searching for the right coach to get your team over the top. \nThe Titans are going about just about everything the wrong way. It's no wonder they've looked like a mess.\n            ",

Richardson will now be out for at least the next four games.Richardson was warming up with an elastic band in the Colts' locker room when the injury occurred. Richardson attached the band to a pole, which snapped and hit him in the face with a lot of force. While Richardson experience severe swelling, it is believed that his eyeball avoided any damage.Through the first five games of the season, Richardson served as the backup to Daniel Jones, who won the quarterback competition in camp. Richardson had appeared in only two games to this point, completing one of two passes for nine yards.\n\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture, standings: Patriots overtake Bills in AFC East; Commanders waste golden opportunity\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPrior to this season, Richardson had yet to deliver on the expectations of being the  No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. His career completion percentage is 50.6% and he's thrown more interceptions (13) than touchdowns (11). Injuries have also been a big part of the story in the early portion of Richardson's NFL career as he played just 15 games in his first two years with Indianapolis.With the Colts' bye coming in Week 11, the earliest Richardson would be able to return is Week 12's game against the Kansas City Chiefs.\nWith Richardson out on Sunday, rookie Riley Leonard was promoted to the backup role. A sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame last spring, Leonard has yet to attempt a pass at the NFL level. As a senior with the Fighting Irish in 2024, Leonard flashed his dual-threat ability with 3,767 yards and 38 total touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Washington Wizards have won a total of 33 games in the last two seasons, and the rebuild is not over. Now that they've acquired three \"second draft\" guys -- AJ Johnson, Cam Whitmore and Dillon Jones -- they have nine players on the roster who were picked in the first round of the last three drafts. All that youth represents possibility, but it doesn't bode well for the Wizards' competitiveness in the short term. Neither does the fact that their 2026 first-round pick is top-eight-protected. This season, then, is about development. Veterans Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum are here to steady the ship, but the big questions are all about the young core: Where is the 20-year-old Alex Sarr's game going on offense? Can the 19-year-old Tre Johnson be more than a bucket-getter? Can the 21-year-old Bilal Coulibaly and the 20-year-old Bub Carrington improve their spot-up shooting? And with so many 19-to-21-year-olds competing for minutes, can Washington start to carve out an identity?The State of PlayLast year: Twenty games into the season, the Wizards had defeated only one team: The Hawks (twice). And it didn't get much better from there: They finished with the league's worst net rating, worst offense and second-worst record. Midseason, Washington's front office made a bunch of moves, picking up two future second-round picks for Jonas Valanciunas, swapping four future seconds for a 2026 first (likely at the end of the round), absorbing Marcus Smart's contract to get an additional 2025 first and sending Kyle Kuzma to the Bucks for Middleton, AJ Johnson and a 2028 pick swap. The offseason: Washington fell to sixth in the lottery, where it selected Tre Johnson, a 6-foot-5 wing out of Texas. It then traded down from No. 18 to No. 21, where it selected Will Riley, a 6-foot-9 forward out of Illinois, in the process picking up the No. 43 pick (which it used on Jamir Watkins) and two future seconds. The Wizards also acquired Whitmore for two second-round picks, Jones for a future second and McCollum, Kelly Olynyk and a future second-round pick from the Pelicans. Assuming Jordan Poole was not a part of Washington's future, the McCollum move was savvy: It sent Poole's (longer) contract, Saddiq Bey and the No. 40 pick (which became Micah Peavy) to New Orleans. It then flipped Olynyk to the Spurs in exchange for Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley and a 2026 second, and it re-signed Marvin Bagley III and Anthony Gill to minimum deals.\nLas Vegas over/under: 21.5, per BetMGMThe ConversationWizards believer: If you want to prove that you're not a casual, get it on this team now. Tell your friends that Will Riley is going to be the steal of the draft. Draft Bilal Coulibaly in your fantasy league. Don't just make outlandish claims about the potential of the Tre Johnson-Alex Sarr pick-and-roll; make outlandish claims about the potential of the inverted Sarr-Johnson pick-and-roll. Remember when Draymond Green praised Kyshawn George and Bub Carrington for getting the Wizards to play harder than they had in years? For a rebuilding team, that's the stuff that matters, not the record … which, admittedly, is going to be pretty bad again.Wizards skeptic: Playing hard matters, but accumulating talent matters more. To me, the Wizards are interesting because they didn't get Cooper Flagg or Dylan Harper and, as they position themselves to get Darryn Peterson or A.J. Dybantsa, they will be figuring out which of their young players are worth continuing to invest in. They've already given up on Johnny Davis, the 10th pick in the 2022 draft, and, while there should be plenty of minutes available for Carrington and Johnson in the backcourt, the wing rotation is looking pretty crowded. It's a weird roster in that way, and also in that there are barely any bigs here. I'm concerned that Washington still might not have found a real centerpiece, and that, with this odd collection of players, it'll be hard for the front office to even tell what it has.Wizards believer: People say this kind of thing about every rebuilding team. If you don't have the patience to watch these young guys, then don't! You can just tune in when the Wizards are playoff-bound and ascendant and pretend that you saw it coming all along. Personally, I think they're going to be a more mature, well-balanced team in 2025-26. Jordan Poole was fine last season, I guess, but I'm much more excited to watch Johnson with the ball in his hands. There's a ton of length on this team now, and there should be internal development across the board.\nWizards skeptic: What kind of internal development, though? Will Sarr actually be able to finish around the rim consistently in Year 2? Will Coulibaly make defenses pay for ignoring him? Flagg would have changed everything for this franchise, but I'd feel so much better about the Wizards if they'd just wound up with Kon Knueppel. There is a long history of guys like Johnson -- tough shot-maker, not much of a driver, not much of a passer, not much of a defender -- flaming out.Wizards believer: Flaming out?! Johnson hasn't even played an NBA game yet, and you're predicting he's going to be out of here like Davis? Again, be patient! Think about the big picture. The Wizards have a clean cap sheet going forward, a bunch of extra picks at their disposal and a ton of young players with upside. They also have guys like Middleton, McCollum and Corey Kispert -- yep, still here, and still a solid role player! -- to tie lineups together. You can complain about the lack of bigs, I guess, but I like that Sarr will be forced to play the 5 and I'm fine with guys like Coulibaly, George and Cam Whitmore sliding up to the 4 spot.Wizards skeptic: I would have been fine with that a few years ago. Now more teams are playing double-big, and I expect Washington to get beaten up on the boards virtually every night. And while Kelly Olynyk wouldn't have done much about the rebounding issue, I kind of wish the Wizards had kept him anyway. He would have at least served as a connective playmaker and floor spacer, and there's a glaring shortage of guys like that on this roster. And to be clear, I'm not predicting that Johnson will flame out. I'm merely saying that, for a player with his strengths and weaknesses, it's in the realm of possibility. You can call me impatient if you'd like, but I really don't care what Washington's record is this season. I just want to know that the Wizards have found a real keeper or two.\n            ",

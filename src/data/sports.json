The Cardinals only had 136 passing yards in a 21-7 loss to Northern Illinois in their most recent game. Kent State has had offensive issues of its own this year, scoring 14 points or fewer in half of its eight games. The Cardinals have gone Under in 14 of their last 18 November games, and the model has the Under hitting in 65% of simulations on Wednesday. Bet on college football at FanDuel Sportsbook:Under 230.5 in Lakers vs. Spurs (-110)Los Angeles continues to play without veteran star LeBron James (back), and Austin Reaves (groin) is a game-time decision. The Lakers have had to lean heavily on Reaves and Luka Doncic early in the season due to James' absence, leaving them without a ton of offensive firepower. They are facing a Spurs team that leads the NBA in points allowed per game (108.2). The Lakers have been solid defensively so far as well, ranked 14th in points allowed (116.6), so the model has the Under hitting 57% of the time. Bet on the NBA at FanDuel Sportsbook:Warriors +3 vs. Kings (-110)Golden State will be without Stephen Curry (illness) on Wednesday night, but it still has enough firepower to stay with Sacramento. The Kings gave up 39 first-quarter points in a 130-124 loss to the Nuggets on Monday, falling to 2-5 overall this season. They are coming off a four-game road trip, leaving them potentially fatigued in this game. Golden State picked up a 118-107 win over Phoenix on Tuesday, improving to 5-3 this season. The Warriors will be shorthanded on Wednesday, but the model has accounted for that and still has Golden State covering in 64% of simulations. Bet on Warriors-Kings at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Wednesday.

Records show that Allen, 43, was booked into the Poinsett County Jail just after 2 p.m. on Wednesday and is facing two charges -- one count of possession of less than two grams of a Schedule 1 or 2 drug and one count of possession of less than four ounces of a Schedule 4 drug. The arrest followed a traffic stop involving a vehicle driven by William Hatton, 33, with Allen as the passenger, according to The Associated Press. A \"strong odor of marijuana\" was detected, and the vehicle was subsequently searched. Marijuana was found on Allen and a cigarette box with a \"white powdery substance,\" later identified as cocaine, was also located, according to a police report. Hatton confessed to possessing drug paraphernalia containing marijuana during the stop, per Action News 5 in Memphis. The 14-year NBA veteran began his career with the Boston Celtics in 2004 after being selected with the No. 25 overall pick. Allen played six seasons for the Celtics and won a title in 2008, but was best known for his time in Memphis. He played for the Grizzlies from 2010 to 2017 and earned six All-Defensive team selections -- three first-team honors (2012, 2013, 2015) and three second-team honors (2011, 2016, 2017). Allen finished his career playing one season for the New Orleans Pelicans.\nAllen had his No. 9 retired by the Grizzlies in March, joining longtime teammates Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph in receiving that honor. He has also dealt with off-court issues, including pleading guilty in August 2023 in a federal fraud case involving NBA health insurance.\n            \n    ",

Suarez's suspension was applied after Game 2 of the opening round by the MLS Disciplinary Committee following its review of footage of Miami's match against Nashville and deemed that he committed violent conduct when he kicked Nashville defender Andy Najar in the 71st minute.Defender Ian Fray was also fined for diving during the match, but this suspension of Suarez is a major blow to the Herons. After Lionel Messi, Suarez has been the next most effective attacker on the team with 14 goals and 15 assists in all competitions, but when it matters most, he'll now be unavailable, and manager Javier Mascherano will need to look to other options \"Inter Miami CF accepts and respects the decision made by the MLS Disciplinary Committee,\" Inter Miami said in a statement. \"At the same time, the club wishes to express its concern about the precedent set by re-refereeing a play that had already been judged by the match officials and VAR, and its confidence that the same standard will be applied in the future to all on-field situations, in any match and involving any team.\"\nThis is the second suspension for Suarez this season after picking up a nine-game suspension for spitting on a Seattle Sounders staff member during Leagues Cup play. That suspension included six games in Leagues Cup play and three more in MLS play. The Miami forward has an extensive history of going over the line on a soccer pitch.Suarez has received three biting bans of varying lengths during his career -- four months for biting Giorgio Chiellini in 2014, 10 games for biting Branislav Ivanovic in 2013, and seven games for biting Otman Bakkal. He was also suspended after being found guilty of using a racial slur against Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.\nIt's a blow to Miami when this tie is a critical one. Win and they're through to the next round, but with a loss, it'll be a long offseason. If it's level after 90 minutes, aggregate won't matter as things will go right to penalties, increasing the pressure on the tie.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        When Estevao opened the scoring for Chelsea only 16 minutes into their Champions League match against Qarabag on Wednesday, it seemed like they'd roll to victory in Azerbaijan, but instead they found out why Qarabag are one of the surprise outfits of this UCL campaign in a 2-2 draw. After Hato conceded a penalty via a handball in the box, Qarabag were able to go into the half with a 2-1 lead, and while Alejandro Garnacho did pull a goal back to level things, the Blues couldn't find a winner in a game that was a grind from start to finish.With almost a 3,000 mile journey to Baku, Enzo Maresca had to rotate his squad to cope with the travel, but it only took eight minutes for his carefully laid plans to be destroyed when midfielder Romero Lavia left the match with an injury and was replaced by Moises Caidedo. At half, another shift was made was Tyrique George was limited to only 13 touches in the first half and had to be pulled in favor of Liam Delap, who returned from a hamstring injury.\nThe changes did work as the Blues were able to turn a loss into a draw but being outperformed by Qarabag isn't what they had in mind. The Blues held most of the possession and took 16 shots while only generating 1.08 expected goals. Meanwhile, Qarabag generated an xG of 1.65 on only nine shots. Even taking out their penalty, that efficiency shows what Chelsea are missing in their striker merry-go-round. The Blues have been forced into making changes due to suspensions and injuries, but depite their hot starts to life at Chelsea, the duo have combined for three goals and three assists in all competitions.\nWingers like Estevao and Pedro Neto have done what they can, but without Cole Palmer, the attack's struggles put too much pressure on Reece James and the defense. Qarabag essentially out-did Chelsea at their own game, turning counters into goals, and there was nothing that Robert Sanchez could do about it. Many of these issues are resolved when Palmer returns to the center of the pitch, but when the Blues have aspirations of finishing in the top four of the Premier League while also balancing Champions League, they need to perform in these moments when their stars aren't available.\nit's what the top teams do, and so far, Chelsea haven't bridged the gap from being a good team to becoming a great one. They're still on the right track to advance to the knockouts of this tournament, but while losing to Bayern Munich showed how far they have to go, this game showed where depth players need to improve to make the Blues a more consistent side.\n            ",

After celebrating his second touchdown against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday with exactly two hip thrusts, Dowdle has been fined, he announced on social media.Upon plunging into the end zone, Dowdle re-enacted the famous \"Key & Peele\" sketch with all his teammates counting his \"two pumps.\" Unfortunately for Dowdle, the show wasn't up to date on the NFL rulebook, which prohibits any celebrations of a sexual nature.\nOn Wednesday, Dowdle posted about his fine before starting a GoFundMe. According to ESPN, it was a $14,491 fine for the Panthers running back.\n\"After much thought I've launched a GoFundMe for my fines,\" Dowdle wrote on his GoFundMe page. \"Key said I got three pumps but I guess the NFL disagrees.\"\nWhile that portion of the GoFundMe was a joke, Dowdle is actually raising money for a good cause. The Panthers' breakout star said all money donated will be directed to Children's Home Society of North Carolina. As of Wednesday night, Dowdle had raised nearly $10,000.Two days prior to the fine being handed out, Panthers coach Dave Canales was asked about Dowdle's celebration. He joked about calling up Keegan-Michael Key (who hilariously responded to the ordeal) for an explanation, but he also acknowledged Dowdle probably should've just played it safely.\"We gotta be smarter in that situation,\" Canales said. \"We gotta make sure that we understand the rules. Might have to call up Keegan-Michael Key and get some clarification on that part of it. From what I understand, it's any kind of movement that way or any kind of weapons, it's all gonna get flagged.\"\nThe Panthers host the New Orleans Saints this weekend, and we'll see whether Dowdle presses his luck with another pump or two if he finds paydirt.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In Manchester City's resounding 4-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund, Erling Haaland may have stolen the show with City's second goal in the 29th minute of play, but it was a good moment to get him the ball by Jermie Doku as well. The Belgian floated the ball into space, and it seemed like he had a telepathic connection to pick out Haaland's run, but as he opened up to CBS Sports following the match, that wasn't the case.It's a bit of why Haaland is great because Doku explained that he saw the space and trusted that someone would find their way into it.\n\"I saw the defenders going to the post, and I saw a gap, and I said, 'Someone has to be there,'\" Doku said on the UEFA Champions League post-match show. \"I just play in the gap. I didn't have the time to see Erling. I just saw the gap, and I played in the gap, and he was there.\"That level of trust in the team's style is part of why the City attack is able to be so good. Doku has been finding his own footing with the team, already having two goals and four assists in all competitions as the 23-year-old is combining his devastating pace with his improving vision and ability to be able to pick out a pass. That's something that he was able to improve during his time with the Belgian national team, where he worked with Thierry Henry, who was an assistant coach with the squad.\n\"I just play free. I come to the ball and I don't care if I lose the ball or not, I play free and purely out of instinct. I go where the ball is, and I don't think about the consequences. If I think too much about the statistics, then I'm not going to do it. So it comes naturally, and I also speak with a legend that sometimes helps me as well.Doku is referring to what he's learned from Henry, which is something that he expanded on how Henry's guidance has helped him with his take ons.\"Nobody really talks to me about my 1v1s, but he was the first person ever that talked to me about my 1v1s and how, how I can be better and effective in the last phase,\" Doku said. \"Because a lot of people say Jeremy, have to be more statistics, more statistics, but how? They don't tell me how. Just do it, do it, do it, but how? And he really talks to me about how, and that's the first time, and I appreciate that.\"\nIn response, Henry went into what he talked to Doku about and it's clear how it came into his assist for Manchester City.\n\"He has zero limits but he needs guidance. When you explain something to someone, if there is no thought process behind it, they're not going to comprehend what needs to happen,\" Henry said. \"We all know that he can finish, but sometimes you need to slow down and re-accelerate to see the big picture. \"Do you see the solution or do you see the problem? When you put your head up, your eyes can be pretty deceiving. What do you see? Do you see the problem? We see the solution; the brain will make you see the solution. Sometimes eyes can be deceiving, and you see the problem; that's the difference.\"\nIn an age where analytics are growing, this feels like a throwback to where wingers got chalk on their boots and fired crosses into the box. A Guardiola system can be criticized for turning players into robots, but Doku is showing that there is individuality left at Manchester City, which can help push the team forward as they look to win another Champions League title. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        More people watched Game 7 of the 2025 World Series than any game since the 1991 Fall Classic. The game drew 51 million viewers across the United States, Canada and Japan. Overall, the entire World Series was the most watched globally since 1992 and it was a 19% increase over last season. That same Game 7 had roughly double the number of viewers in the United States as Game 7 of the NBA Finals. In this day and age and in a non-football sport, that's staggering.Yes, NFL and college football people who love to scream at the other sports about ratings, we get it. You're the true monster of American sports. You dominate us. We get it. I'm a big football fan, too, so I have no problem with more people watching it. There's room to celebrate victories in other sports as well. We should still acknowledge that the 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays was a major success for Major League Baseball.Unless you're a network executive, you shouldn't care about TV ratings. But these numbers tell us more about baseball than just ratings.\nOne of the loudest arguments against MLB right now revolves around salary. The Dodgers, the first repeat champions since 2000, had the top payroll in baseball, which means the suggestion is that if a team just \"buys\" a championship -- it's never even remotely that simple, by the way -- then people will start to tune out the sport. In that narrative, it's imperative for the league to get control of spending in order to bring back all the fans who quit watching. You'll also hear nonsense like, \"it's just the same teams every year!\" The Blue Jays hadn't been to the World Series since 1993. Last year's runners-up, the Yankees, hadn't been since 2009. The 2023 World Series pitted a team that won its first-ever World Series against a team that hadn't been there since 2001. So that argument doesn't fly. Now we're back to the whole \"no one pays attention because it's not fair without a salary cap\" argument.\nAnd yet, the numbers speak for themselves, don't they? Not only did the Dodgers just win the World Series with the top payroll in baseball, but they are the repeat champions and 51 million people watched them win Game 7. Were they watching to root against the Dodgers? Possibly. Does it matter why people watched or does it only matter that they watched?Again, the entire structure of this pro-salary cap argument is that the product is bad without it and people will stop watching because they're bored. They want to see underdogs, not big spenders. And yet more people tuned in to watch the Dodgers and Blue Jays (who, by the way, had the fifth-highest payroll in MLB) than had in more than three decades.The more people watch, the more the league makes money. This is a business. From this perspective, the league just had its most successful World Series since at least 1992. Given the current media environment with so many other viewing options on different mediums, you could probably make the argument it was the most fruitful World Series, I don't know, ever? \nI do know this much: the whole \"MLB needs a salary cap to keep people interested\" argument really collapses on itself when you see these kinds of numbers. Put it this way, do you really think a Brewers-Rays World Series would've done this kind of business? It sets up an interesting discussion point for the owner side in front of the next CBA, coming next offseason. We know the players are very averse to a salary cap and the owners want one. I agree that it's unfair to have such a gigantic payroll disparity between the Dodgers and the lower third or so of those other teams. I just think the solution is for the lower-tier teams to spend more. There's already revenue sharing. The richest teams are giving money to the \"poor\" teams (psst: None of them are poor). \nWith the league as a whole seeing what kind of interest this World Series generated compared to a year like 2023, it'll be interesting to see how things unfold on the ownership side. We know they love making money. Will they really want to try and mess with what just happened in the name of satisfying some of the cheapest owners? Or will they tell the cheapest owners to start spending the money they get from the deep-pocketed ones?Regardless, the argument that \"baseball is dying\" or \"no one watches\" due to lack of a salary cap was just exploded like both Death Stars. There are 51 million reasons to get a new argument.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Jacksonville Jaguars were \"buyers\" at this year's NFL trade deadline, as they sent a pair of draft picks to the Las Vegas Raiders for wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. Multiple teams were reportedly interested in Meyers, but it was first-year Jacksonville coach Liam Coen that landed him.   Meyers has just 33 catches for 352 yards this year, but he's registered four straight 800-yard receiving seasons -- including a 1,000-yard campaign in 2024. The Jaguars hope he can bring some stability to an inconsistent passing attack using his \"superpower.\"    \"We're looking forward to seeing how his skill set fits within the system,\" Jaguars general manager James Gladstone said, via ESPN. \"I think from afar it does. You think about where we're at in terms of volume of drops, what's his superpower? It's not dropping the football, right? So you just take it from the surface level, it seems fitting.\"   \n        \n            \n                Jakobi Meyers trade grades: Jaguars bolster WR room as Raiders collect future picks\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUsually catching the football is not a \"superpower\" for a wide receiver. But for the Jaguars, it is approaching that territory.   \nJacksonville plagued by drops   According to CBS Sports Research, the Jaguars are tied in having the most dropped passes (30) through eight games since 2000. Jacksonville has also not gotten much production from its top wideout, Brian Thomas Jr.    After a historic rookie campaign in which he caught 87 passes for 1,282 yards and 10 touchdowns, Thomas is averaging just 3.8 receptions and 52.5 receiving yards per game with only one touchdown. He had four 100-yard receiving games as a rookie, but has yet to cross that threshold in 2025.    Brian Thomas Jr. 2024 to 2025   20242025Reception percentage 65% 50% Receiving yards per game 75.4 52.5 Yards after catch per reception 6.5 3.7 Thomas is still the Jaguars' leading receiver with 420 yards on 30 receptions, but they haven't gotten much production elsewhere. No. 2 overall pick Travis Hunter, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner and Fred Biletnikoff Award winner, has just 28 catches for 298 yards and a touchdown -- and it's unclear when he'll see the field again. To put those numbers in perspective, he's averaging fewer receiving yards per game than tight ends Juwan Johnson and Harold Fannin Jr.    Overall, the Jaguars passing offense ranks No. 16 in the NFL with 215.3 passing yards per game, but if you take into account just the numbers from the receivers, it looks much worse.       Trevor Lawrence targeting WRs this season         NFL RankCompletion percentage 56% 30th Yards per attempt 6.9 26th TD-INT 5-6 28th Passer rating 73.0 30th Recent injuries led to Meyers tradeApart from acquiring a new weapon that can potentially bring some stability to a unit that desperately needs it, the Jaguars also needed a new wide receiver. Period.    Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury, Thomas did not practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury, Tim Patrick has a groin issue and Dyami Brown is working through a concussion. Parker Washington, who led Jacksonville on Sunday with 90 yards on eight catches in the overtime victory over the Raiders, has been earning Lawrence's trust, but the Jags needed to add more talent in this department. Meyers helps with that.      An important Week 10 showdown   Not many view the Jaguars' Week 10 tilt vs. the rival Houston Texans as the game of the week, but it's incredibly important when it comes to the AFC South. The 5-3 Jags defeated the 3-5 Texans earlier this year, and sweeping the season series would not only put more ground between them and Houston in the division, but also inch Jacksonville closer to the 7-2 Indianapolis Colts. The Jaguars are 1.5-point road underdogs for Sunday's matchup.This decision to add Meyers was made with contending in mind, and that begins on Sunday. Meyers himself is not going to revolutionize Jacksonville's offense, but if the veteran pass-catcher can quickly establish himself as a reliable target for Lawrence, it's something that could take this team to the next level.    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        I want to let you guys in on a little secret. Big swings in Dynasty rankings are not that much fun for those of us who compile Dynasty rankings and update them regularly. Sure, they're a fact of life, but ultimately they mean that a week ago, or even a month ago, the person who put together the rankings was wrong. In the case of both Kyler Murray and Rico Dowdle, it appears I was very wrong. Let's start with the riser; at least he's not depressing.In Week 9, Dave Canales gave the backfield to Dowdle even though Chuba Hubbard was available. And what Dowdle did makes it unlikely that will change unless there is another injury. Dowdle produced 141 yards and two touchdowns against a very good Green Bay Packers defense. It was his third game since the start of October with at least 26 PPR Fantasy points. Since Week 5, he is one of three running backs to score at least 100 PPR Fantasy points. What does this mean? Well, for this year, it means that Dowdle is potentially a league winner. If you have him on your roster and you aren't a contender this year, it means you should see if any of the true contenders will give you a first-round pick for him. I would aim for a 2027 pick because the class looks better on paper and because true contenders are definitely going to have late picks in 2026, but they may fall off next year and give you a more valuable pick. For contenders, the first thing I would try to do is package two second-round picks and see if the team that has Dowdle will bite. If not, I would consider giving up a 2026 first if I really thought he was the piece that could put me over the top. On a recent episode of Fantasy Football Today, we debated whether Dowdle was a top 12 running back rest of season, and half of us thought he was. That is where the conversation starts.In the Dynasty rankings below, he ranks as RB34. Why so low? He's a 27-year-old on a one-year contract. There is no guarantee he will have a role with this much upside in 2026 or 2027. But the odds are growing every week.\nThis week on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty, I had Jacob Gibbs on to talk about the trade deadline and which slumping players we should have hope for. Check it out:One of the slumping players we talked about was Kyler Murray. He was first benched for Jacoby Brissett and then placed on Injured Reserve. We don't really expect him to start another game this year unless Brissett gets hurt. But in Dynasty, his situation is nearly the opposite of Dowdle's. He has $57 million in dead cap money after the conclusion of this season. Also, he's in the prime of his career, and a year ago, nearly everyone had him ranked as a top 12 QB in Dynasty and at least an average QB in the NFL. I would bet on Murray starting somewhere in Week 1 of the 2026 season, even if it is not in Arizona.While Murray did fall to QB25 in the rankings below, I would still call him a hold. That is easier because he is on IR, and many leagues have a place you can stash those guys. If you don't have those spots, I am still holding in all Superflex leagues and all but the most shallow of one-QB leagues. There are not enough starting QBs in the NFL for 32 teams to pass on Murray if they get the chance. And as of November, there aren't enough good prospects in the 2026 class to fix the problem. If you wanted to try to buy in Superflex leagues, I would not offer more than a Round 2 pick. \nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine. There you'll find trade values for both Superflex and One-QB trades to help you dominate your Dynasty league.Here are my updated Dynasty Quarterback Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Running Back Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Wide Receiver Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Tight End Rankings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After breaking Wayne Gretzky's all-time record last season, Washington Capitals legend Alex Ovechkin is now the inaugural member of the NHL's 900-goal club. Ovechkin reached No. 900 with his tally in the second period against the St. Louis Blues on Wednesday night.Throughout his career, Ovechkin has scored goals in a variety of ways, and his 900th might have been one of the most unique. After a Jakob Chychrun shot bounced off the end board, Ovechkin scooped up the puck and snuck a spin-o-rama backhand past a sprawling Jordan Binnington.\nIt was another historic moment for Ovechkin, and Binnington tried to keep a piece of history all to himself. While the Capitals were mobbing Ovechkin, Binnington managed to sneak the puck into his pants, thinking no one would notice.Was Binnington going to flip it on eBay for a little extra cash? Was he going to keep it on his mantle? Maybe Binnington was simply going to chuck it in the garbage out of spite. Whatever plans Binnington had, they were spoiled when a linesman skated by and made him retrieve the puck.\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 NHL Draft, Ovechkin has been climbing the record books at a rapid pace since his rookie campaign in 2005-06. Ovechkin has hit the 40-goal mark 14 times, and he's surpassed 50 goals on nine different occasions. Ovechkin has won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the league's top goal-scorer nine times, far and away the most in NHL history.\n        \n            \n                NHL Power Rankings: Cardiac Canadiens keep producing one thriller after another as they soar into top five\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, Ovechkin finally surpassed Gretzky with his 895th goal and entered the 2025-26 season with 897 under his belt. After a somewhat slow start, at least by his standards, Ovechkin has earned another distinction with goal No. 900.There are still 70 games left in the season, and Ovechkin hasn't even indicated that this will be his last, though he is playing on an expiring contract. So, exactly how many goals can Ovechkin score before his career is over?\nHow many goals can Ovechkin score in his NHL career?Ovechkin has the chance to add a lot of cushion to his all-time goals record. And there aren't any major signs of him slowing down, at least offensively. Yes, Ovechkin is 40 years old, but he is built very differently from almost every other athlete.This is a player whose favorite pregame meal is an Italian feast fit for two or three. He also takes Pepsi in his water bottle and Dr. Pepper at intermission. Let's also not forget that, at the age of 39, he broke his fibula during the season and still managed to score 44 goals en route to breaking Gretzky's record.To this point in his career, Ovechkin has never scored fewer than 32 goals in a season. Let's at least give him that in 2025-26, which doesn't seem unreasonable considering he scored 44 in 65 games last year. That would put Ovechkin at 929 goals by season's end, but what if he decides to play another season or two? After all, the Capitals are a team on the rise with a good young coach, so maybe he wants to chase another Stanley Cup.\nIf nothing else, Ovechkin could extend his career to the age of 41 or 42 on the strength of his power play prowess alone. In 18 of his 19 full seasons, Ovechkin has scored at least 13 power play goals and as many as 25. If teams were going to stop his patented one-timer from the left circle, they probably would have done that at some point over the last two decades.If Ovechkin can stay on the ice for the rest of this season, plus 2026-27, it's well within the realm of possibility that he could eclipse 950 goals. It's probably fair to say 1,000 goals is probably out of range for Ovechkin, but it would not be wise to put his chances of getting there at zero because of the longevity, durability and consistency he's shown to this point.\n            ",

Stroud out for Houston's Week 10 showdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Stroud is still in the league's concussion protocol stemming from last week's loss to the Denver Broncos. With Stroud out, Davis Mills makes his first start since the 2022 season. A 2021 sixth-round pick, Mills made 25 starts during his first two seasons with the Texans. He played in two previous games this year while playing in relief of Stroud. Stroud exited last week's game early in the second quarter after his head hit the turf as a result of a hit he endured while sliding. He immediately left the game and was ruled out for the remainder of the contest during the third quarter. \nIt's been a trying season for Stroud and the Texans. After winning back-to-back AFC South titles and subsequent playoff games, Houston is currently 3-5 and behind the Colts and Jaguars in the division standings. Specifically, Houston has struggled in the red zone on both sides of the ball. The Texans' offense is also second-to-last in the NFL on third down. Stroud is just 19th in the NFL in passing touchdowns, but he is completing a career-high 66.5% of his passes. He has also thrown just five interceptions after throwing a career-high 12 picks in 2024. \nThe Texans face a Jaguars team Sunday that is making steady progress under first-year coach Liam Cohen. The Jaguars' pass defense hasn't been a strength, however, as they are 27th in the league in passing yards allowed, 29th in touchdown passes allowed. They are second in the NFL with 11 interceptions through eight games. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A classic rivalry will have its next installment on 'Thursday Night Football' to kick off NFL Week 10 as the Denver Broncos host the Las Vegas Raiders. Denver (7-2) is tied for the best record in the league and is riding a six-game win streak, which is also tied for the NFL's longest. The Broncos had a comeback victory at Houston in Week 9, defeating the Texans, 18-15, via a walk-off field goal. Meanwhile, the Raiders (2-6) suffered a defeat out of their bye on Sunday as they lost in overtime to Jacksonville, 30-29. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 73-56-2. Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) and receiver Marvin Mims (concussion) have been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver. The Broncos swept the season series in 2024, after the Raiders had won each of the previous eight meetings. The latest Raiders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 8.5-point favorites. The over/under for total points is 42.5.

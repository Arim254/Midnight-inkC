The civil suit involving an alleged incident at a 2023 NBA Finals game was dismissed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, according to ESPN.The female plaintiff voluntarily filed for dismissal on Tuesday. The voluntary dismissal was filed with prejudice, meaning no further litigation can be brought forward. McGregor had denied all allegations against him and no criminal charges were pursued by the Florida State Attorney's Office in the case.The woman, described in the lawsuit as a 49-year-old business executive, accused McGregor of sexual assault during Game 4 of the series between the Miami Heat and Denver Nuggets in June 2023 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. The alleged assault took place in the men's restroom near the Courtside Club inside the arena, which is the home of the Heat. The plaintiff filed a civil suit against McGregor and the Heat in January.Last November, a High Court jury in Ireland found McGregor civilly liable in a separate sexual assault case. McGregor was ordered to pay approximately $258,300 to Nikita Hand. Earlier this year, Ireland's High Court dismissed McGregor's appeal. \nMcGregor, a former two-division UFC champion, has not competed in mixed martial arts since sustaining a broken leg against Dustin Poirier in July 2021. McGregor is currently campaigning for a comeback fight at the White House card this summer.\n            \n    ",

At UFC 323 on Saturday night in Las Vegas, Dvalishvili will look to become the first to make four successful UFC title defenses in one year if he beats Petr Yan a second time.There have been more than 100 UFC champions. Not one of them has done what Dvalishvili gets the shot to do. The UFC bantamweight champion has successfully defended his title against Umnar Nurmagomedov, Sean O'Malley and Cory Sandhagen in 2025. Should Dvalishvili overcome Yan, who he previously beat in 2023, \"The Machine\" will hold a record uniquely his own. Against Yan, Dvalishvili faces a former champion finding his second wind after ripping off three straight wins.A second title fight supports UFC 323. Alexandre Pantoja is building a strong case for being the second-best flyweight champion in UFC history, behind only Mount Rushmore fighter Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. His next challenger is compelling. Joshua Van burst onto the scene, going from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years. Like Dvalishvili, he fights for the fourth time this year in pursuit of becoming a UFC champion.\n        \n            \n                UFC 324: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett, Kayla Harrison vs. Amanda Nunes to headline Paramount+ debut card\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe undercard also features some veterans looking to get back to the title level.

    "body": "\n        Wide receiver Adam Thielen's representation approached the Minnesota Vikings about releasing him, as the 35-year-old wideout wanted to play a larger role in an offense in what will be his final NFL season. Thielen, after being waived Monday, will get a chance to do just that after being claimed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday.The Vikings traded for Thielen prior to the start of the regular season, as their wide receiving corps was hit hard by injuries. However, in 11 games played this year, Thielen caught just eight passes for 69 yards. He was made a healthy scratch this past week, as the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0.In Pittsburgh, Thielen joins a wide receiving corps headlined by DK Metcalf, although he is the only pass-catcher to cross 300 yards receiving this season. In Thielen, Aaron Rodgers acquires a veteran playmaker that can move the chains.\n\"I was joking with him, he said this is the best his body has felt because he hasn't been playing a whole lot in Minnesota,\" Rodgers said following Wednesday's practice. \"So I think he's got a lot left in the tank and a lot of impetus to go out there and put some good play on film.\"\n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin on hot seat? Coach offers legitimate reason why Steelers fans are justified calling for his head\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThielen was productive for the Carolina Panthers over the last two seasons, crossing 1,000 yards receiving in 2023, and averaging 61.5 receiving yards per contest in 10 games played in 2024. Thielen, in his 12th NFL season, was picked up by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013 and ended up playing nine years for the team. He ranks fourth in franchise history in receptions (542), fifth in receiving yards (6,751) and third in receiving touchdowns (55).\nThe 6-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North race. The Baltimore Ravens, also at 6-6, own the tiebreaker, while the 4-8 Cincinnati Bengals are lurking in the background with Joe Burrow back in the fold. Pittsburgh has a 44.8% chance to win the division, and 45.1% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo's New Jersey home was pelted with eggs hours after Philadelphia's Week 13 loss to the Chicago Bears, according to police. A video on social media shows multiple people throwing objects at Patullo's home. The video includes audio of someone telling Patullo to \"get the f--- out of Philly.\" The Moorestown Police Department has stated that the investigation is ongoing.Patullo's home was vandalized following another tough outing for the offense -- scoring just 15 points while committing two turnovers while Saquon Barkley carried the ball just 13 times for 56 yards. Several days removed from the incident, Patullo, a first-year coordinator, told reporters that criticism comes with the territory of a high-profile job but anything involving a coach's family \"crosses the line.\"\"Unfortunately, it happened,\" Patullo said Wednesday. \"I've been here for five years now, and it's been awesome. This is such a unique place to coach and play. It's very special. We've been to two NFC Championship games. We've won at Lincoln Financial, a Super Bowl, the parade. It's an amazing atmosphere to be a coach and a player. And as coaches and players, we all know that part of our job is to handle criticism. It's perfectly acceptable to sit up here and talk about what's going on, how to fix it, what we're going to do going forward, and we know that. But when it involves your family, it obviously crosses the line. That happened, and at this point, we've just gotta move on.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 14 NFL picks: Packers cool off Bears in NFC North showdown, Cowboys keep rolling vs. Lions\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrough 12 games, the Eagles' offense is 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing, 22nd in rushing and 28th in third down efficiency. Philadelphia is getting it done in the red zone, however, as it is currently tops in the NFL with a 75.9% touchdown rate. While he said that he will evaluate everything following the loss to Chicago, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni is sticking with Patullo as his offensive play-caller. Patullo, 44, has been on Sirianni's staff since he took over back in 2021. Patullo previously served as the team's pass game coordinator. He was promoted to offensive coordinator when Kellen Moore left to coach the New Orleans Saints. \"I have confidence in the entire group,\" Sirianni said. \"I know it will keep coming back to Kevin. If I thought it was one thing, I'd make those changes. Obviously, it's a lot of different things. I don't think it's Kevin.\"\nDespite their offensive struggles, the Eagles will head into their Week 14 with the Los Angeles Chargers with an 8-4 record and in first place in the NFC East. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Devin Williams is changing boroughs. Williams and the New York Mets have agreed to a three-year contract, the team announced Wednesday. The deal includes $45 million in salary plus a $6 million signing bonus and deferrals, according to the New York Post.The signing reunites Williams with David Stearns. Williams was a minor leaguer with the Milwaukee Brewers when the club named Stearns their general manager in September 2015, and the two overlapped in the organization until Stearns left to take over the Mets two years ago. Surely that relationship played a role in the signing.Williams, 31, spent this past season across town with the Yankees and had a turbulent season, throwing 62 innings with a 4.79 ERA. He allowed 37 runs in 2025 after allowing 33 runs combined from 2022-24. Williams was dominant at times, however, and he finished the season with 90 strikeouts in those 62 innings. He was a trusted late-inning reliever in the postseason. \n\"At first it was a challenge, but I've grown to love being here,\" Williams said after the Yankees were eliminated from the postseason. \"I love this city. I love taking the train to the field every day.\" We ranked Williams as the 19th-best free agent available this offseason, and the second best reliever behind erstwhile Mets closer Edwin Díaz. Here's the write-up: \n\"High-Lev Dev\" is a strong rebound candidate based on, if nothing  else, the incongruity between his ERA and his underlying data. There  were 21 pitchers who made 30 or more appearances in 2025 without any  starts and who possessed a strikeout rate above 30% and a walk rate  below 10%. Williams' 4.79 ERA was the worst of the group, which as a  whole put up a 2.76 mark -- to the extent that the next worst ERA was  just over 4.00. Williams somehow managed that while sporting the fourth-best hard-hit percentage of the bunch, behind names like Josh Hader and Abner Uribe.  Things happen in this game sometimes, particularly with individual  relief seasons. There's no compelling reason to think Williams has lost  his touch just yet. \tWe explained further why Williams, despite his disappointing season with the Yankees, was a highly coveted free agent with a chance to bounce back to his All-Star form. The Williams signing does not necessarily preclude Díaz returning to the Mets, though it does make it less likely. New York's bullpen was in rough shape most of the 2025 season and it could be that they hope to pair Williams with Díaz rather than have Williams replace Díaz. Either way, Williams figures to be the first reliever the Mets acquire this winter, not the only one. Lefties Brooks Raley and A.J. Minter are the only other locks for New York's bullpen at the moment. Minter missed most of this past season with season-ending lat surgery. Righty Huascar Brazoban is a candidate for another bullpen spot.  \nThe Yankees did not make Williams the $22.025 million qualifying offer, so they will not receive a compensation draft pick for losing him nor will the Mets surrender draft picks to sign him. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For as cliched as the tired phrase typically sounds, that fighters become 30% better upon winning the championship, it's an adage that UFC flyweight titleholder Alexandre Pantoja has very much made true of late. The 35-year-old Pantoja (30-5) has embarked upon a meteoric rise up the sport's pound-for-pound rankings in recent years as he enters a UFC 323 title defense against Joshua Van (15-2) at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. And even though the defining narrative regarding Saturday's co-main event has surrounded the age gap between them and the rapid rise of the 24-year-old challenger from Myanmar, the division's best untold story of late has been Pantoja's remarkable turnaround. Pantoja, a native of Brazil, was a self-proclaimed brawler with a strong jiu-jitsu game when he entered his first title shot in 2023 as an underdog against Brandon Moreno. And the disputed split decision he ultimately claimed by biting down the mouthpiece and slugging it out over five brutal rounds won an emotional Pantoja respect, even if most felt his advanced age and reputation for absorbing damage would lead to a short-lived (and transitional) title reign. Two years later, Pantoja is entering his fifth title defense ranked among the top pound-for-pound fighters in the sport and somehow appears to be getting better, more efficient and even more dominant with each fight. \n\"I just started believing I could be a UFC champion only three or four years ago when I came to American Top Team, which is the best gym in the world,\" Pantoja told CBS Sports last week. \"We have the best athletes, best coaches. American Top Team is a mecca for MMA.\"\n        \n            \n                UFC 323 fight card: Henry Cejudo vs. Payton Talbott, plus multiple former champions in Las Vegas\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Pantoja is always quick to credit the venerable gym in Coconut Creek, Florida, for his evolution, which has included years of training alongside former flyweight champions Kyoji Horiguchi (RIZIN) and Adriano Moraes (ONE Championship), the financial security brought upon him by becoming UFC champion has been just as important. \"I have money to invest much more in my professional area,\" Pantoja said. \"I can be an athlete full-time with a full camp. I can invest my money in better physical therapy, best supplements, best life to living very healthy. I'm from Brazil and had to invest a lot of money to start my new life here and then I had a little struggle with my bank account. Right now, it's very different. I can enjoy more with my wife and kids and I can provide a better time for my family.\"\nHeading into his first title bout, Pantoja was still delivering food as a side job to make ends meet for his wife and two sons. But just two years later, he looks like a completely different fighter as it has become clear that the investments he has made into himself have made him a better and more confident athlete. A quick glance at his last two title defenses, which featured dominant submission wins over Kai Asakura and Kai Kara-France, have confirmed this theory as Pantoja has appeared to separate himself behind Demetrious Johnson (and his UFC-record 11 title defenses) as the second best flyweight in promotional history. \"I start to believe more in myself in everything that I did. Now, I start to put more into my technique and I'm still evolving my game,\" Pantoja said. \"I think I can prove more control of the Octagon. I don't need to hate so much. Before, I was like a brawler, I liked to fight. I thought this was very good entertainment for everybody. I went there and put everything out. But I needed to protect myself more. I don't need to make a street fight all the time. I have so much technique. I am very happy with everything I did, but I think the big point is I proved that I improved with all my camps.\" \nThe fact that Pantoja is 35 in the promotion's smallest weight division, where speed reigns dominant, is a testament to the hard work he has put in throughout this two-year evolution. The next goal on Pantoja's list of career accomplishments is to become universally recognized as the P4P-best fighter in the world, which he said is the reason \"why I am here.\"Pantoja is the rare fighter who admits he follows the P4P rankings closely. As things stand now, he believes no one deserves to be ranked above welterweight champion Islam Makhachev, who has \"looked unbeatable\" in his new weight class. But, in the meantime, Pantoja would settle for critics to look at him as being on the same level as his elite contemporaries atop the sport -- namely Makhachev, lightweight champion Ilia Topuria and bantamweight king Merab Dvalishvili -- and has often used his post-fight interview time after title defenses to campaign for inclusion.While Pantoja, and the three champions ahead of him on the P4P rankings, haven't been extolled with any kind of historically relevant moniker like boxing's \"Four Kings\" of the 1980s, he does believe that collectively the four fighters are responsible for elevating the sport to an entirely new level during this decade. \n\"I think those guys, and I put myself in that club, are such complete fighters,\" Pantoja said. \"We bring the new level to UFC and a new level to MMA. I think every fighter in the world understands that to get the UFC belt, he needs to go forward to evolve his level to compete with Islam, Ilia, Merab and Pantoja. Everybody understands that the level is different right now in this game.\"I think it's the best time for UFC and the best era for fans and fighters. I think [UFC's new broadcasting] deal with Paramount [the parent company of CBS Sports] can show everybody about that. We deserve all of the credit and I put myself in that club, too.\"Pantoja compared his leveling up in skill, and the effect it has had on both the division and the sport, to what Johnson accomplished 10 years before him as the inaugural UFC flyweight king. \n\"[Johnson] mixed the striking and grappling,\" Pantoja said. \"He made a beautiful MMA fighter and put it all in the game.\"Pantoja believes he can push himself to evolve for an additional two years but admits that after six title bouts since 2023, the physical grind of staying on top of his game all year is catching up with him and that his \"broken\" body \"feels pain all the time.\" It has all been worth it, however, as Pantoja has used his run as champion as an opportunity to change the life of him and his family. Now, he'll look to use that experience he painstakingly gained from a pro MMA career that began in 2007 (when his opponent, Van, was just starting grade school) to prove that he still belongs atop the sport.  \n\"We are living now in the future and everybody wants everything so fast,\" Pantoja said. \"It's like that, the young generation versus old school MMA fighter. I'm close to being a 20-year MMA fighter. A lot happened for me and I feel much better right now after two years getting this belt for the first time, I have evolved so much more. I'm very glad to still be with this belt and have the chance to fight one more time.\"\n            ",

You can check out the full pot-by-pot breakdown here. We've already sorted who would be the best and worst case scenario for the USMNT, but what about El Tri? Who could they play, and is there truly a best scenario given their recent form? Let's get into it:Draw restrictionsNo group will have more than one team from the same federation in it, except UEFA, which is required to have two groups of two UEFA teams in it, due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament. Then there's the challenge of the intercontinental playoffs, which will not be held until after the draw. For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions will be applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams.\nMexico's worst-case draw Mexico's fall from Concacaf grace fizzled as fast as a summer fling, which is the last time they were in any decent form. Despite big gains in early 2025, including a Nations League title win, they hoisted the 2025 Gold Cup in July and have failed to record any wins since. They've got six months to sort themselves out, but it's tough to look at current form and the World Cup pots and not think nearly any scenario could be a worst-case situation. In an effort not to hit every single panic button in sight, here are two draw scenarios that could be disastrous for Mexico.Scenario A:MexicoNorway (UEFA)Colombia (CONMEBOL)Italy (UEFA playoff winner)With the newly expanded field of 48 teams, it could be possible that Group A gets two UEFA teams, and that would be a disaster for Mexico if it's Norway and Italy, or even Sweden or Poland. \nIt's been great seeing the rising profile of Caesar Montes on Mexico's backline, but Erling Haaland would tower over him and anyone else back there. The hope is that the starting centerbacks come out unscathed with no double yellows (or even straight red cards), so that it doesn't force the staff into any early adjustments.Colombia recently wrecked Mexico 4-0 in October, and if Italy finally punches their ticket back into the World Cup after missing out on the previous two editions, they'll be back with a vengeance. That's always a dangerous type of opponent to face when you're in questionable form.Scenario B: MexicoScotland (UEFA)Morocco (CAF) Sweden (UEFA playoff winner)Because why not be the host that gets not one but two European competitors? Feels like it'll be at least one of the hosts that gets that honor and wouldn't be surprised if it's Mexico. \nScotland are riding high on the momentum of earning a place in the World Cup, and they could be a tricky side to handle. Same with Sweden, and Mexico are no strangers to mediocre performances against them as we saw during 2018 in Russia. Morocco will also have pressure on them, as 2022 semifinalists, and favorites as current AFCON hosts. Mexico's best-case drawIf the group stage is about setting yourself up for success in the knockout rounds, then Mexico have work to do. They failed to exit the group stage for the first time in decades during Qatar 2022, and now they'll have some pressure as hosts to return to the knockout rounds. A \"quinto partido\" (fifth game) has been a long-term goal, but now there is a round of 32 ahead of the round of 16, and the home side should strive for more. If they get a favorable group, then why not hope for the best? \nMexicoIvory Coast (CAF)Iran (AFC)New Zealand (OFC)If we're simply going by rankings among other teams across the pots, this could be one of the better scenarios. If it comes down to higher-ranked \"middle\" teams to eventually land one of the lowest-ranked teams in New Zealand, then maybe it adds even more pressure on the hosts. If they don't come out as winners of a group like this, it would be considered even worse than Qatar 2022.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a tale as old as (football) time: a wide receiver and a quarterback getting in a heated debate on the sideline during a game. The latest example came during the Cleveland Browns' 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.During the fourth quarter on Sunday, wide receiver Jerry Jeudy was seen clapping his hands as he and rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who was holding a tablet, discussed something on the sideline. Sanders then got up and appeared to shake his head as their conversation continued.Asked about the situation Wednesday, both said it was no big deal.\"We resolved that. We're not going to speak on that,\" Sanders said. Jeudy said the exchange was about a particular play from the game and the two have since moved on. \"We spoke about it. We're good,\" Jeudy said. \"It's an emotional sport. Things like that happen. It's football.\"\n\n\nIn retrospect, Jeudy said he and Sanders \"probably\" could have spoken away from the camera. \"That's probably what I would have done differently,\" Jeudy said. \"I'm going to speak my mind and say what I see out there, but it is what it is. It's football. Me and Shedeur good. Stuff like that happens.\"Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said the situation was handled internally.\"Football is an emotional sport and certainly when you're a family like we are, you can have your disagreements. Sometimes they're for everybody to see. Sometimes it's behind closed doors. But like a family, we move on, we talk about it, so not worried about it,\" Stefanski said.Jeudy had three receptions for 26 yards as the Browns fell to 3-9. Jeudy set career highs in receptions (90) and receiving yards (1,229) in 2024, but has struggled this season. He has just 35 catches for 421 yards and one touchdown this season as the Browns have had a revolving door at quarterback. \nSanders, a rookie fifth-round pick out of Colorado, is the third QB to start for Cleveland this season. He started the season behind veteran Joe Flacco leaving and rookie third-round pick Dillon Gabriel. But after Flacco was traded and Gabriel was sidelined by a concussion, Sanders was given an opportunity and is set to make his third start of the season Sunday when the Browns host the Tennessee Titans. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The stage is set for the FIFA World Cup draw, which will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. as FIFA has released the final pots for the 48 teams taking part in the World Cup. These pots are based on the FIFA men's world rankings, with the three host countries, the United States, Canada, and Mexico, being joined in pot one by the nine next highest ranked teams in those rankings. They're then followed by the next 12 highest-ranked teams making up pot two, pot three, and so on, until pot four includes the playoff winners from both the UEFA playoff path and the inter-confederation playoffs. Following the draw, the match calendar and stadiums for the World Cup will be released on Saturday, December 6.To balance the draw, the top four teams in the FIFA ranking will be drawn with constraints to keep them separate until the semifinals. Spain, Argentina, France, and England are the teams occupying those slots, and it will see Spain and Argentina drawn into separate pathways so they cannot meet before the final, with the same principle then being applied to France and England.FIFA World Cup potsThe official pots are as follows:Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium,GermanyPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, IR Iran, Korea Republic,Ecuador, Austria, AustraliaPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar,Saudi Arabia, South AfricaPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA, Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2Looking at the pots, there is the potential for some loaded groups, such as the United States getting Morocco, Norway, and Ghana in the same group or Brazil, Japan, Egypt, and Italy (if they make it out of the European playoff) making up a group. Despite the expansion to 48 teams for the 2026 World Cup, there will be some balanced and difficult groups.Draw restrictionsNo group will have more than one team from the same federation in it, except UEFA, which is required to have two groups of two UEFA teams in it due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament. For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions will be applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams.When are the playoffs?All playoffs will take place during the March international break in 2026. The UEFA playoffs are scheduled from Thursday, March 26, with the finals on March 31. The inter-confederation playoffs will take place in Mexico, being split between the Estadio Akron in Guadalajara and the Estadio BBVA in Monterrey, taking place between March 23-31. By the end of March, all 48 teams will be determined and placed in groups.Inter-confederation playoffs drawPATH 1Semifinal: New Caledonia vs. Jamaica Final: Congo DR vs. New Caledonia/Jamaica PATH 2Semifinal: Bolivia vs. SurinameFinal: Iraq vs. Bolivia/SurinameEuropean playoffs drawPATH ASemifinal: Italy vs. Northern Ireland Semifinal: Wales vs. Bosnia and Herzegovina Final: Wales/Bosnia vs. Italy/Northern Ireland \nPATH B Semifinal: Ukraine vs. Sweden Semifinal: Poland vs. Albania Final: Ukraine/Sweden vs. Poland/AlbaniaPATH CSemifinal: Turkiye vs. Romania Semifinal: Slovakia vs. Kosovo Final: Slovakia/Kosovo vs. Turkiye/Romania PATH DSemifinal: Denmark vs. North Macedonia Semifinal: Czechia vs. Republic of Ireland Final: Czechia/Republic of Ireland vs. Denmark/North Macedonia How the World Cup worksIn 2023, it was announced that the 2026 World Cup would be expanded to 48 teams from the previous 32. Divided into 12 groups of four teams each, the expansion will also create a new knockout round that will take place after the group stage, which is now a round of 32 teams. TO make up that 32, the top two teams from each group and the eight best third-placed teams will all advance with a chance at making the round of 16.From there, things will proceed as normal with the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final as Argentina will look to defend their World Cup title from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nHow World Cup slots are decidedThe European confederation (UEFA) is guaranteed 16 slots of the 48 teams, while the African confederation (CAF) has nine, and the Asian confederation (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America, and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff selection committee made a move that raised some eyebrows in its penultimate rankings by swapping Alabama and Notre Dame for the No. 9 and No. 10 spots, respectively. The Fighting Irish, despite walloping rival Stanford 49-20, slipped behind the Crimson Tide in a changing of places that left coach Marcus Freeman puzzled.Alabama won a rivalry game of its own but was not nearly as dominant in a 27-20 Iron Bowl victory over Auburn. The Crimson Tide won by a smaller margin than the Fighting Irish, and its caliber of opponent only marginally better than Auburn, which finished the regular season with just one more win than Stanford. How was that enough for the committee to be convinced that Alabama deserved a higher ranking than Notre Dame? That is the question Freeman is left pondering.\"Obviously you're disappointed, but more so because of a little bit of confusion,\" Freeman said Wednesday. \"You're confused in terms of what we could have done differently and why we fell when we won 49-20. I think we were up 42-6 going into the fourth quarter. I don't spend time talking about other teams, but it's just like, OK, what could we have done differently? I don't know.\"\n        \n            \n                A College Football Playoff bracket without Alabama, Notre Dame or any ACC team? How this scenario could happen\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt surface level, a one-spot difference in the top 25 is hardly sizable. But given where Notre Dame and Alabama stand in the race for inclusion in the 12-team playoff bracket, one spot could be the margin between competing for a national championship and watching the CFP from home.\n\"You always look for cause and effect,\" Freeman said. \"You look for a reasoning why you go up or you fall. For me, you didn't see a great explanation for why we fell when we had the performance we did last Saturday.\"If the favorites in this weekend's conference championship games win, Notre Dame will be in position to hold the final at-large spot in the bracket. But if No. 11 BYU defeats No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game and becomes a \"bid stealer\" of sorts, the Fighting Irish would likely be the team bounced from the projected bracket.CFP committee chair explains controversial rankingsArkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek, who stepped into the CFP selection committee chair position last month, offered an explanation for the swap at the No. 9 and No. 10 spots. Now in his second year on the committee, Yurachek said the debate in the room between Notre Dame and Alabama over the last three weeks has been among the strongest he has witnessed during his CFP service.\n\"I think this week, as we looked at those two teams and how closely they have been over the past three weeks -- Notre Dame went on the road and had a strong win at Stanford, but Alabama went on the road in a rivalry game, looked really good,\" Yurachek said on Tuesday's rankings show. \"I think that was enough to change the minds of a couple of committee members to push Alabama up ahead of Notre Dame in this week's rankings.\"\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: What 12-team field looks like after fifth CFP Rankings released\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne possible explanation for Alabama's climb to No. 9 is that the committee may have sought to protect the Crimson Tide from falling out of the bracket in the event it loses to No. 3 Georgia the SEC Championship Game. The committee set a precedent in previous years that it wishes not to punish title game losers for falling short in a 13th data point.Yurachek, however, said that was not a consideration for this week's rankings and instead would be discussed after the championship games are complete.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're only a few days from the Winter Meetings and we've started to see a trickle of moves here in the MLB offseason, which means it's possible things start to pick up a bit. As such, the rumor mill is churning and we're going to round up the best nuggets of news and rumors here for the day, which is Wednesday, Dec. 3. Let's get to it.Dodgers bring back RojasThe world-champion Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to terms with infielder Miguel Rojas on a one-year, $5.5 million pact, El Extrabase reports. After the 2026 season, Rojas plans to retire and work in a player-development role for the Dodgers. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Rojas as the No. 42 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: Rojas will celebrate his 36th birthday in the spring and he hasn't started more than 100 games in either of the past two seasons. In an ideal world, he would continue to serve as a team's third middle infielder; in this one, he might land a starting role. Rojas remains a plus defender with experience at each of the \"skilled\" infield spots. His offensive game continues to tilt toward contact, but his overall output has improved since he arrived in Los Angeles and learned to pull the ball more frequently. It would be a mistake to assume his topline results will maintain with more exposure. At the same time, it's not as though this class offers much in the way of reliable alternatives.Rojas is coming off a 2025 campaign in which he slashed .262/.318/.397 with seven home runs and a WAR of 2.1 in 114 games for the Dodgers while spending time at every infield position. He also famously hit a game-tying home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series and made a game-ending double play to clinch the title.Reds re-up with PagánThe Reds have re-signed right-hander Emilio Pagán to a two-year, $20 million contract that will cover the 2026 and 2027 seasons, the Athletic reports. Pagán ranks 37th on CBS Sports' list of the top 50 free agents of the current offseason. Here's part of our write-up: \nAll relievers are volatile, but Pagán is an extreme case. He's highly dependent on fly-ball contact, to the point where last season represented the fourth time in his career that his batted-ball profile has included more than 70% fly balls and line drives. Pagán nevertheless managed the second best ERA+ of his career by generating an extreme amount of swing and misses on his three-pitch arsenal: both up on his fastball and beneath on his splitter and cutter. There are teams in certain ballparks who just shouldn't bother; a team with a spacious field, though, could slot him right into the ninth.Pagán, 34, worked 68 ⅔ innings for Cincy last season, and over that span he pitched to a 2.88 ERA with 81 strikeouts. Rays sign MullinsThe Tampa Bay Rays have agreed to terms with veteran outfielder and free agent Cedric Mullins on a one-year contract pending the results of a physical, the Tampa Bays Times reports. The deal is worth a reported $7 million. \nEarlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Mullins as the No. 41 available free agent in the class of 2025-26. Here's part off RJ Anderson's write-up: Mullins' play went into the tank after a deadline trade to the Mets. The concerns here are bigger than 40-odd games, though, and have to do with an offensive profile that works best in only a handful of parks. He was able to carve out a career as a league-average hitter (for the most part) behind a lift-and-pull approach that saw him slug more than expected. In turn, Mullins has steadily run a high pop-up rate. When his strikeout rate spiked last season, all the way up to a career-worst 24.1%, he found himself making too many automatic outs to counterbalance. Mullins might be able to make the math work again if he signs with a club with generous right-field dimensions. In a combined 133 games for the Orioles and Mets in 2025, Mullins had an OPS+ of 94, and he showed declining defense in center field. He's going into his age-31 season in 2026. \nBrewers drawing 'significant interest' in PeraltaEarlier this offseason, reports surfaced that the Brewers were not interested in trading ace Freddy Peralta. In fact, as recently as yesterday the reporting was that the Brewers were going to keep him.Lately, though, according to The Athletic, things might be leaning in the other direction.Perhaps this was inevitable, but the interest in right-hander Freddy Peralta is so significant, the Milwaukee Brewers are now considering \"cracking the door open\" for trade discussions, according to a person briefed on their situation.Peralta is 30 years old next season and is coming off arguably the best year of his career. He was 17-6 with a 2.70 ERA (154 ERA+), 1.08 WHIP, 204 strikeouts in 176 ⅔ innings. He posted a career-high 5.5 WAR. He's set to make $8 million in 2026 before hitting free agency. If the Brewers think 2025 was the peak for Peralta and that he'll definitely walk in free agency, you can see the line of thinking to accept huge trade offers here. They previously dealt Corbin Burnes a season before free agency. Given the conflicting reports of late, it's safe to assume the situation is fluid with the Brewers listening to trade offers and maybe even considering them while leaning toward keeping Peralta until they're blown away.\nMariners weighing infield optionsThe Mariners are looking for some infield help as they head to the Winter Meetings. From the team that made it all the way to Game 7 of the ALCS this past season, second baseman Jorge Polanco and third baseman Eugenio Suárez are both free agents. They already brought back first baseman Josh Naylor on a five-year, $92.5 million deal. Polanco is the \"top target\" for the Mariners, according to the Seattle Times. While the interest is mutual, the two sides, at this point, are reportedly not \"close to a deal.\" The Red Sox, Yankees and Pirates are mentioned as other possible suitors for Polanco.The Mariners have \"kept the door open\" regarding a reunion with Suárez, too, according to the Times.As far as any interest the Mariners have in players outside the organization, they have repotedly \"expressed interest\" in Cardinals utility man Brendan Donovan. He's under control by the Cardinals, so this would be a trade for Donovan to take over at second base in the event the Mariners can't come to a deal with Polanco.\nAstros looking at pitching depthThe Astros were crushed under the weight of pitching injuries over the last two years, including lengthy absences from the likes of Cristian Javier, Lance McCullers Jr., Luis Garcia, Ronel Blanco and Spencer Arrighetti. What's more, ace workhorse Framber Valdez is now a free agent. Knowing all this, it isn't surprising that the Astros are targeting depth at the Winter Meetings. They don't \"have the financial resources\" to a top free agent, per MLB.com, but they have a \"desire\" to land pitchers who are still under team control via trades. Center fielder Jake Meyers is mentioned as a possibility for the Astros to trade for said pitching. Marlins not inclined to deal Alcantara or Cabrera?People love talking about trading prospects to the Marlins in order to grab controllable players because, well, look at their history. This time around, the Marlins are apparently trying to hold and maybe even extend some of their own players, according to MLB.com.\nSpecifically, high-upside Edward Cabrera and former Cy Young winner Sandy Alcantara have seen their names bandied about in trade rumors since early last regular season, but the Marlins are repotedly not \"actively trying to trade\" either, though if that were to change, Christina De Nicola speculated that Cabrera is the more likely of the two to be dealt. Blue Jays willing to deal BerríosThe Blue Jays have signed starting pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce so far this offseason. Given that they have Kevin Gausman and Shane Bieber coming back in addition to rookie sensation Trey Yesavage, that's a full, five-man rotation without getting to veteran and former All-Star José Berríos. Sure enough, they are willing to part with Berríos in a trade, according to The Athletic. Berríos, 31, was 9-5 with a 4.17 ERA (102 ERA+), 1.30 WHIP and 138 strikeouts in 166 innings along with 1.3 WAR last season. Keep in mind that he's due over $18 million this season before roughly $24 million in each 2027 and 2028. In light of their recent signings and trying to bring back Bo Bichette, it's possible the Jays are trying to shed salary in dealing Berríos. \nObviously, teams these days need more than five starting pitchers, but the Jays already have depth beyond their starting five with Eric Lauer and Bowden Francis.Former GM Byrnes takes Rockies' GM positionFormer Diamondbacks and Padres general manager Josh Byrnes has been hired as the general manager of the Rockies, the team announced Wednesday. Keep in mind that there's been a shift in titles over the course of the past decade-plus and that GM isn't necessarily always the big boss in the front office. Here, Byrnes is second in command under new president of baseball operations Paul DePodesta. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. women's national team is settling in for a long winter's nap after capping off the year with a pair of wins. The Stars and Stripes closed out 2025 with two victories against Italy and plenty of growth to reflect upon. Under the guidance of head coach Emma Hayes, 2025 was a year of player pool expansion and intentional experimentation, laying the groundwork for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. The squad will have December as time off before reconvening in January for the annual New Year camp. The unofficial window may not include certain European club players at the time, as January camps often fall outside of an official international window. That opens the door to even more extended looks at players, or re-evaluation of those already regular cast members in the expanded pool. Now the page turns towards a new year, and the World Cup qualifiers are officially less than a year away with the Concacaf W Championship set to take place in November 2026. With so many new players integrated into the program at the senior level and the U23 team, who are the ones that will make the coaching decisions increasingly difficult? We've already have a 2027 World Cup roster projection, so for this exercise, most players from the 2024 Olympic squad will not be considered. Only athletes who either earned more caps, made their debuts, and earned first-time call-ups, or have not been with the squad for an extended period of time will be categorized.\nHere's who I think is a World Cup qualifier lock, on the bubble, or on the outside looking in, for now.Locks for qualifiersGoalkeepers: Phallon Tulis-Joyce, Claudia Dickey They're the only pair of goalkeepers to earn two consecutive starts during any of the international windows, and they're both coming off big club seasons. Tulis-Joyce recently sustained a fractured eye socket that kept her out of end-of-year camps and Manchester United's recent Champions League window, but she has seven clean sheets in the tournament dating back to qualifying rounds. Dickey earned NWSL second-best XI honors and was a finalist for goalkeeper of the year. Defenders: Tara McKeown, Avery Patterson A solid club season for Patterson, though the Houston Dash's slow start hampered playoff chances. Still, the fullback made a good impression whenever she earned minutes with the USWNT, and it can't all fall upon Emily Fox. The centerback position gets a little trickier. Here's the truth: if Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson, and Emily Sonnett are all healthy and ready to go come November qualifiers, then McKeown's battle as a depth option is up against Emily Sams. \nMidfielders: Lily YohannesPart of 2025 has also been the hampering of any expectations for a young midfielder. Hayes has been vocal about taking off the pressure for the 18-year-old, but that's been difficult to do when Yohannes keeps showing off her vision and skillset.\nForwards: Alyssa Thompson, Catarina Macario If the door is open for the Olympic gold medal-winning \"triple espresso\" attacking line of Sophia Wilson, Mallory Swanson, and Trinity Rodman to return in 2026, then they have finally some added cavalry in tow. After missing out on time with the national team for nearly all of 2024, Thompson has become a constant starter for Hayes. Also coming off a discouraging 2024 is Macario, who removed herself from Olympic selection after making the roster due to injury concerns.Now, Macario is nominated for female player of the year after functioning as a false nine in Hayes' system with seven goals and two assists. It's her best year in a USWNT kit since coming back from an ACL injury; she started nine games with her goals scored against Colombia, Brazil, China, New Zealand, and Italy.\nOn the bubbleGoalkeepers: Mandy McGlynnMcGlynn began the year with starting minutes, but those dwindled over the year with the emergence of Tulis-Joyce and Claudia Dickey's form. She's still a regular call-in as part of the goalkeeper core and will likely remain if she keeps up consistent club performances. Defenders: Lilly RealeReale has only a limited number of senior appearances (six, per Opta), but her minutes (449) rival fullback Avery Patterson's (518), while Reale has fewer appearances (six) this year. This is a positive for the program, as the outside back role has often been a point of concern over a lack of depth, but now there are options.Midfielders: Jaedyn Shaw, Olivia Moultrie, Claire HuttonSome good problems are emerging for Emma Hayes and her staff. Both Shaw and Moultrie are players who began the year as part of the U23 squad, and were examples of player profiles by Hayes as players who could be ready now vs. players who could be ready later.\nForwards: Michelle CooperHow does one buy stock in Cooper? Let me know immediately. I rate her that highly. I think the USWNT coaching staff also rates her. Quite possibly the best example of the U23 integration, Cooper got time in January 2025 futures camps, earned a spot on the national team in February and never gave it back. A late-season injury kept her out of the Kansas City Current's playoff appearance and the final international window of the year, but she played 10 games for USWNT, with one goal and two assists, all while being a wrecking winger in the process. OutliersGoalkeeper: Jordan SilkowitzWhile Bay FC had a challenging season that led to an early elimination from playoff contention, goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz was a bright spot. The injury to Tulis-Joyce opened a spot, and if the Bay keeper maintains form, maybe Silkowitz will be that fourth depth chart keeper. \nDefenders: Kennedey Wesley, Gisele Thompson, Jenna Nighswonger, Crystal DunnFirst and last time Jenna Nighswonger made a camp roster was in January. Crystal Dunn was in March. Safe to say their moves to Europe have not panned out in terms of actual minutes played, despite the experiences of being overseas. It's good to see the U23 program work in both directions between senior call-ups and continued development. Wesley is a centerback who started in the U23s in 2025 but aged out later in the year. She eventually earned senior call-ups to close out 2025. Though that might look different now that Girma is healthier and back in the mix. Wingback Gisele Thompson had a promising start to the year but missed out on camps due to injury, and she might be one of those \"ready later vs. ready now\" type of players Hayes had referred to in the past.\nMidfielders: Ally SentnorA revamped U23 program means that players who could use more development have a place to do that outside of their clubs. After call-ups with the senior team, a midseason move from Utah to Kansas City changed the way Sentnor was utilized. It meant that a sophomore NWSL player was now on a club depth chart instead of the face of a team to end the NWSL season. She was part of the U23 side that recently defeated England, 4-2, and she scored a goal in the second half. Don't be surprised if her extra minutes and overseason experience boost her back into the senior mix.Forwards: Emma SearsI don't truly believe Sears is on the outside, so let's make that clear. There's just an abundance of attacking players in this program now, and only so many spaces on a World Cup qualifying roster. A lot will depend on the availability of \"triple espresso\" come November 2026, and even then, Thompson, Macario, and Cooper are forwards who might be in front of her on the depth chart. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 World Cup draw will take place on Friday at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C. at 12 p.m. ET. This is going to be one of the most important moments ahead of the much-awaited summer tournament that will take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, kicking off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and ending on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City. Friday's draw, the first for the newly-expanded 48-team World Cup, will define the path to the final for all the teams involved, but while 42 have already clinched a spot next summer, six more will know their path with the playoffs taking place in March 2026. Let's now take a look at all you need to know ahead of Friday's draw: When is the draw taking place? The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will finally reveal the group-stage paths for the 42 teams already secured, including the three co-hosts (Canada, Mexico, and the United States), and the six contenders for the final spots in the inter-confederation and European playoffs set for late March 2026. FIFA announced it will be co-hosted by Heidi Klum, Kevin Hart and Danny Ramirez.How to watch FIFA World Cup 2026 drawDate: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts -- Washington, D.C.TV: Fox | Live stream: Fubo (try for free)How does the draw work? Canada, Mexico and the United States, as the host countries, will be assigned to positions A1 for Mexico (green ball), B1 for Canada (red ball) and D1 for the USA (blue ball), as already established per the match schedule released in 2024. The remaining nine top-ranked teams in pot 1 will be identified by nine balls of the same color and automatically allocated to position one of the group into which they are drawn.\nTo ensure competitive balance, two separate pathways to the semifinals have been established when developing the match schedule. In order to have a balanced distribution of the teams, the four highest-ranked teams in the FIFA Men's Rankings, when drawn, will have the following constraints: the highest-ranked team (Spain) and the second highest-ranked team (Argentina) will be randomly drawn into opposite pathways, and the same principle will apply to the third (France) and fourth (England) highest-ranked teams. This will ensure that, should they win their groups, the two highest-ranked teams will not meet before the final.No group will have more than one team from the same federation in it, except UEFA, which is required to have two groups of two UEFA teams in it, due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament. Then there's the challenge of the inter-confederation playoffs, which will not be held until after the draw. For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions will be applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams.Teams qualified Spots clinched: 42/48World Cup hosts Since the 2026 World Cup is co-hosted by three nations, they all receive an automatic qualifying spot in the tournament. \nUnited StatesMexicoCanadaAFC Qualifiers IranUzbekistanSouth KoreaJordanAustraliaJapanQatarSaudi ArabiaConcacaf QualifiersHaitiCuracaoPanamaOFC QualifierNew ZealandCONMEBOL QualifiersArgentinaBrazilEcuadorColombiaParaguayUruguayCAF QualifiersMoroccoEgyptTunisiaGhanaCabo VerdeAlgeriaSouth AfricaSenegalIvory CoastUEFA qualifiersEnglandFranceCroatiaPortugal Norway Germany Netherlands SwitzerlandScotlandSpainAustriaBelgium World Cup pots The four pots also include the six teams that are to be determined, and all of them will end up in the fourth pot of the draw, with teams like Italy, Poland and Sweden potentially landing in the last pot.

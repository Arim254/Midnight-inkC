Underdogs went 4-2 against the spread on Wild Card Weekend, which could certainly affect where you lean with your divisional round NFL picks. Sunday divisional round NFL bets center on Patriots vs. Texans at 3 p.m. ET and Rams vs. Bears at 6:30 p.m. ET. The Pats (-3.5, 40.5) are on a 1-6 run versus the line when they have a rest advantage, which could make them ones to fade with Houston coming off a Monday victory, despite the Texans being without Nico Collins (concussion).Meanwhile, L.A. is the only Wild Card team that lost against the spread but won its game outright, as the Rams are 4.5-point road favorites (O/U 48.5) in the latest divisional round NFL odds. However, the Rams have prevailed in their last four trips to the Windy City, but how much should that matchup history sway your NFL picks? All of the updated divisional round NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best divisional round NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The model has Chicago prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. The Rams are the lone team still in the playoffs that lost versus the spread last week, as L.A. has dropped two straight ATS on the road. Chicago, meanwhile, has just two ATS losses over its last nine games overall. Los Angeles' defense is falling apart as its 31 points allowed in the Wild Card win versus Carolina tied for the Panthers' most scored all season, as the former has allowed 28.3 points over its last seven games. On the other hand, Chicago is much more stout on that side of the ball at home, giving up just 16.3 points over its last four home contests.

With that type of potency, no team has more against-the-spread victories than Los Angeles' 12 this season, while the Bears are just 2-7 ATS over their last nine divisional round playoff games. The L.A. offense sometimes overshadows the other side of the ball, which is elite in itself. No team has allowed fewer rushing scores than Los Angeles, which also finds itself in the top 10 in interceptions, sacks and passer rating allowed. That defense contrasts with what Chicago offers as the Bears rank 29th in total defense and allowed 6.0 yards per play in the regular season, which was the third-most in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bears can coverThe Windy City has certainly provided a home-field advantage for the Bears who are 8-2 both straight-up and ATS over their last 10 home games versus the Rams. This season, the team is 11-4-1 ATS over its last 16 games, while the Rams are the only team playing this weekend that lost versus the spread in the Wild Card Round. The Rams have lost against the line in three of their last four road games, and Chicago's highly efficient offense can exploit Los Angeles' suddenly leaky defense. No team has committed fewer turnovers than the Bears, who also possess top-10 rankings in both points scored and yards gained. Meanwhile, the Rams have given up an average of 30 points over their last five contests and have allowed multiple passing touchdowns in five of their last seven games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears     picksSportsLine's model has simulated Bears vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 52 combined points.

The Bears outscored Green Bay 25-6 in the fourth quarter to erase a three-score halftime deficit. Williams shook off two interceptions and finished with two touchdown passes and 361 passing yards, including some clutch fourth-quarter passes that got Chicago back in the game. While the Bears have some deficiencies on defense, they boast a top-10 scoring offense as Williams has spread the ball around to DJ Moore, Rome Odunze, Colston Loveland, Luther Burden III and others. They are getting more than a field goal at home this week against a Rams squad that was shaky at Carolina this week, giving them a great chance to cover. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Rams can coverDespite failing to cover in the wild-card round, Los Angeles has been one of the best NFL teams against the spread this season. The Rams are 12-6 ATS overall and 11-5 ATS as the favorites. Stafford leads the league's best scoring offense as the Rams are the only team in the NFL that averages more than 30 points per game. They also have a top-10 scoring defense, giving up just 20.9 points per game. Stafford has been in the MVP conversation this season, and he has an extremely strong supporting cast. Running backs Kyren Williams and Blake Corum have combined for nearly 2,000 rushing yards, while receiver Puka Nacua led the NFL in receptions (129) in the regular season and ranked second in receiving yards (1,715). The Rams should be able to exploit a Bears defense which ranks 29th in yards allowed. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears picksHartstein is leaning Over on the total.

    "body": "\n        If Indiana beats Miami on Monday night to win the College Football Playoff National Championship, the school will have completed one of the most shockingly fast turnarounds in sports. Just two seasons ago, the Hoosiers were an also-ran in the Big Ten, to put it politely. Now, under Curt Cignetti, they're a national powerhouse.That got us thinking about some of the quickest turnarounds in modern sports history. Which teams came from nowhere only to reach the pinnacle of their sport in just a few short years later after a dramatic turnaround? Some may have forgotten how bad a legacy team like the Boston Celtics were prior to their 2007-08 championship run. And then there was an expansion team like the 1997 Florida Marlins, who won it all in just their fifth year of existence.Sometimes, all it takes is one key player to make all the difference. Just ask the 1999 St. Louis Rams or the 2010 Auburn Tigers. Those squads got major shots in the arm from the right spot at the right time, and then just rode that to championships.Before Indiana tries to complete its dizzying ascent to the college football throne, let's look back on some of the fastest turnarounds ever in the sports world.\nNew York Rangers (1992-94)Despite boasting a wealth of talent, the 1992-93 Rangers just couldn't put it all together and finished last in the Patrick Division at 34-39-11. Perhaps the biggest issue was that star defenseman Brian Leetch was limited to just 36 games due to injury. On top of that, Mike Richter had one of his worst seasons between the pipes with a 3.82 GAA and a .886 save percentage.The very next season, Leetch was fully healthy, and he tallied 79 points from the blue line. Forward Adam Graves exploded for 52 goals, and Richter bounced back with 42 wins, a 2.57 GAA and a .910 save percentage. After a year in which nothing went right, the puck bounced the Rangers' way constantly in 1993-94, and the team rolled to a first-place finish.The Rangers made quick work of their first two playoff opponents, going 8-1 against the New York Islanders and Washington Capitals. Then, with the Rangers down in the three games to two to the Devils in conference final, Mark Messier guaranteed a road Game 6 (at New Jersey) before advancing and taking out the Vancouver Canucks in seven games in the Stanley Cup Final. Leetch took home the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nFlorida Marlins (1993-97)Let's first all agree that time is relative. The Florida Marlins lost 98 games in their 1993 debut, and then -- along with the rest of Major League Baseball -- lost games in its second and third seasons due to the 1994 strike. Fans in South Florida would have been downright giddy at the prospect of going 80-82 in 1996, but then came the unthinkable: Winning a World Series championship the following season, in only the team's fifth year of existence.Seeking a win-now strategy, team owner Wayne Huizenga busted out the checkbook heading into that 1997 season, signing veterans everywhere, including left fielder Moises Alou, third baseman Bobby Bonilla and pitcher Alex Fernandez. Jim Leyland, a manager with World Series experience, was also brought on board, and those acquisitions joined a roster that already had a young Gary Sheffield and rookie shortstop Édgar Rentería. Darren Daulton and Craig Counsell were picked up at the trade deadline, and in the playoffs, Cuban rookie pitching sensation Liván Hernández sparkled, winning NLCS and World Series MVP honors.A five-year turnaround might not seem fast-fast, but when you consider the team Florida beat in that 1997 Fall Classic was a Cleveland franchise that -- to that point -- had gone five decades without a World Series title, yeah, we'd say what the Marlins did was relatively quick.\nSt. Louis Rams (1998-99)The Rams went 4-12 in 1998, and they did so with a Hall of Fame quarterback sitting on the bench. Instead, Tony Banks led an offense that scored just 17.8 points per game.Going into the 1999 season, Kurt Warner wasn't even supposed to be the starter. The Rams brought in Trent Green, but he tore his ACL in the preseason. That gave Warner his shot, and he didn't miss. He threw for 4,353 yards and 41 touchdowns while Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt and Az-Zahir Hakim formed a three-headed monster at receiver.Joining Warner in the backfield was running back Marshall Faulk, acquired from the Indianapolis Colts via trade after the 1998 season. Faulk totaled 2,429 yards from scrimmage and 12 touchdowns and he finished second in MVP voting. The Rams went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV in early 2000 in a 23-16 thriller against the Tennessee Titans.\nDetroit Shock (2002-03)The Shock won just nine games in 2002, and they were the only team to finish the year with single-digit victories. Detroit was especially dreadful on defense, allowing 70.8 points per game, which was one of the worst marks in the WNBA. Of course, that overall record disguises a positive upward trend that occurred after Bill Laimbeer took over for Greg Williams, who led the team to an 0-10 record. The Shock went 9-13 under Laimbeer, and they carried that momentum into the 2003 season.The defense didn't improve much in 2003, but the offense took off with 75.1 points per game. Swin Cash led the way with 16.6 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. The biggest addition was No. 3 overall pick Cheryl Ford, who won Rookie of the Year with 10.8 points and 10.4 rebounds per game.The Shock took down the Cleveland Rockers and Connecticut Sun in the first two rounds of the postseason before beating the Los Angeles Sparks in the WNBA Finals.\nBoston Celtics (2006-08)The 2006-07 Celtics were about as far away from an NBA title as you can be. Their 24-58 record was the worst in the East, and only the Memphis Grizzlies had a worst record overall. An injury limited Paul Pierce to 47 games, and the team around him collapsed. The following offseason, general manager Danny Ainge got to work.Boston swung blockbuster deals, landing both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, to assemble a Big Three. That trio -- combined with ascending players like Rajon Rondo and Glen Davis -- proved to be lethal. The Celtics had the best record in the NBA in 2007-08, and they fought their way through an arduous postseason.Two series went seven games and the other two ended after Game 6, one of which being an NBA Finals championship over the Kobe Bryant and Boston's arch-rival Los Angeles Lakers.\nAuburn Tigers (2008-10)In 2008, the Tommy Tuberville era on The Plains came to an unceremonious end with a 5-7 season. The Tigers were 2-6 in SEC play, and they scored just 17.3 points per game, which ranked 111th in the country.The following season was the start of Gene Chizik's tenure as coach, and while there were some improvements, Auburn still had its fair share of flaws. With Chris Todd and Ben Tate leading the way on offense, Auburn's offense rebounded to 33.3 points per game. Unfortunately, the defense didn't hold up its end of the bargain, and the Tigers finished with a respectable 8-5 record, although they were 3-5 in league play.In 2010, Auburn found lightning in a bottle thanks to one of the greatest seasons from any college football player ever. Cam Newton came in to play quarterback, and he was a one-man wrecking crew. Newton totaled 4,327 yards and accounted for 51 touchdowns, and those gaudy numbers earned him the Heisman Trophy. Thanks to Newton, the Tigers ran the table and beat Oregon to win the BCS National Championship.\nLeicester City FC (2014-16)There are long shots, and there are LONG SHOTS. Leicester City's drive to the 2015-16 Premier League title doesn't only fall in the all caps category it practically screams in 48-point font that there won't be anything like it ever again. Claudio Ranieri's men were an unfathomable 5,000-1 shots before the season began, but there was, indeed, a chance.After losing half of their game in their first Premier League season of 2014-25, For magic to happen that season, the club needed a few things to go right. First was that the traditional powerhouses in England all struggled to some degree or another with Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool all falling apart while Arsenal and Tottenham narrowly failed to catch the unlikely winners. From there it was the magical alchemy of a trio of yet to be appreciated stars in N'Golo Kante, Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy surrounded by a consistent, workman like set of role players that danced between the raindrops to become the unlikeliest story in Premier League history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        After weeks of uncertainty, the Tennessee Volunteers have found a quarterback in the transfer portal. Former Colorado signal-caller Ryan Staub has committed to Tennessee, per multiple reports. The Vols hosted several quarterbacks over the last month, including Sam Leavitt formerly of Arizona State and Beau Pribula of Missouri. Ultimately, Tennessee lands a commitment from Staub. As a redshirt sophomore, Staub completed 30 of 55 passes for 427 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions in five total games played last season. In his one start against Houston, a 36-20 loss, Staub completed 19 of 35 passes for 204 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. The Stevenson Ranch, California, native was given a three-star rating by 247Sports as a member of the 2023 class, and received offers from Colorado, SMU, Arizona, Fresno State, South Florida and Nevada. Joey Aguilar quarterbacked for the Vols in 2025, and threw for 3,565 yards, 24 touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 13 games played. His 274.2 passing yards per game led the SEC, and he crossed 300 yards passing in four games. There is a chance that Aguilar could receive an extra year of eligibility thanks to Diego Pavia's ongoing lawsuit against the NCAA, but it's unknown how likely that is. Tennessee's 2026 quarterback room is headlined by redshirt freshman George MacIntyre and incoming five-star freshman Faizon Brandon, who 247Sports ranks as the No. 2 quarterback in this class behind Keisean Henderson.\nThe Vols took a step backwards following the 10-3 campaign in 2024 that came with a College Football Playoff appearance, as Tennessee went 8-5 and 4-4 in SEC play. Tennessee went 0-4 vs. ranked opponents, which included a 45-24 loss to Vanderbilt in the final game of the regular season. Tennessee wrapped up the year by losing to Illinois in the Music City Bowl, 30-28. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The first tournament of the 2026 PGA Tour season produced a winner who has made a habit of raising trophies in his limited time on the circuit. Chris Gotterup blended power and touch like a seasoned veteran at the 2026 Sony Open as the third-year player crafted a masterclass on Sunday with a final-round 64 to put him at 16 under for the tournament, two strokes clear of runner-up Ryan Gerard.Gotterup's triumph at Waialae Country Club marks his third on the PGA Tour in as many seasons as he entered the winner's circle in Myrtle Beach his rookie year before outclassing Rory McIlroy at the Scottish Open last summer. The 26-year-old now trails only McIlroy (eight) and Scottie Scheffler (four) among active players in terms of consecutive seasons with a PGA Tour win. He is also the sixth player since 2024 to collect three or more wins.After opening his season with a 7-under 63, Gotterup entered the final round at 10 under and two strokes behind Davis Riley, the 54-hole leader. Riley had converted one of his previous two 54-hole leads on the PGA Tour and looked comfortable in the position early with two birdies in his first five holes.However, just as Riley appeared to be settling into his own, a rough three-hole stretch saw him pencil bogey, bogey, double bogey onto his scorecard. The door flew wide open, and Gotterup stepped through.\nThe big-hitting right-hander overpowered the classic Seth Raynor design, chopping off doglegs and taking egregious lines off the tee, doing so without sacrificing any semblance of accuracy. Four front-nine birdies saw him capture the lead by himself before he took full control of the tournament in the middle of his back nine.\nFor all his power off the tee, Gotterup got going thanks to his touch on the greens. He dialed up birdie connections from 21 feet on No. 12, 26 feet on No. 13 and 12 feet on No. 17 to put the tournament on ice just as Gerard was beginning to breathe down his neck.With only the par-5 finisher remaining, Gotterup flighted another beauty into the middle of the fairway. A layup, a wedge to the middle of the green and two putts were all that remained as Gotterup stepped up to the challenge and in doing so may have stepped up in class. Grade: A+\nHere are some of the other notable finishes on the 2026 Sony Open leaderboard.T4. Robert MacIntyre (-12): MacIntyre entered the week as the third-highest-ranked player in the field, and he looked the part on Sunday. The world No. 8 fired a final-round 63 -- the lowest of the day -- that included five front-nine birdies and zero dropped shots. MacIntyre was finally able to combine his approach play and putting and noted his frustrations on the greens earlier in the week had boiled over so much that he snapped his putter on Friday. There was none of that over the weekend as he started his season on a high note.\"This is one of my favorite golf tournaments of the year, to be honest,\" MacIntyre said. \"This is one of the best golf courses we play all year. Any one of the guys out there can play this golf course on their day. You don't have to bomb it. You can be short. It's just a proper test of golf, more like what we would play in Europe when we go to Valderrama, Belgium. You got to shape the ball. Obviously, the breeze gets up, but yeah, this is a great start. A lot more to come. \"But always a massive reminder of attitude has to be spot on. Last year, I felt like I done a great job of that. Yeah, I think expectations first two rounds have kind of affected me with that, but yeah, starting to manage it better. Obviously nice when you're playing well. It's easier to manage. Something I really got to switch on for the rest of the year.\" Grade: A-\nT13. Hideki Matsuyama (-9): The former tournament champion snuck his way into the weekend thanks to some late-round heroics on Friday and parlayed that into a strong Moving Day. Matsuyama was sensational from tee to green on Saturday in particular, carding a third-round 65 that featured seven birdies and just about nothing made on the greens. Matsuyama pushed it as deep as 9 under through his first five holes in the final round, but two bogeys and no birdies across his next 11 holes put any chance of a Sunday surge to bed. Grade: BT24. Jordan Spieth (-7): There were plenty of positive signs for those in the Spieth camp as he opened with two straight 68s before a Sunday 69. At various points of the tournament, he flashed in all areas of the game, but he just seemed allergic to momentum. Every time he took one step forward, he took one step back and was never able to create a snowball effect of rolling one quality hole into another. That could stem from multiple areas, but close-range putting is a place to start. \"I thought I kicked some rust off,\" Spieth said. \"I thought it was better than a month ago. Certainly, a lot of positives to go off. Historically, I've had a really hard time on these greens; that continued this week. But I'll go into some more familiar ones coming up the next few events. I got either a week or two weeks, depending on when I play next, to kind of trim the fat a little bit and get tighter and more consistent. \n\"But I was very happy with the control of the ball, especially in the conditions. Then today was a day-to-day take advantage and got off to a nice start, and unfortunately, was a just little off today with the striking and with the putting. Days like that happen. You kind of hope they happen on Monday and not on Sunday. It was a little bit of an off day, but all in all, coming into the week, I felt pretty confident about where things were at, so I would've liked to maybe finish higher. It was a nice finish, birdieing the last couple and feeling like I can take some momentum into the beginning of the season and hopefully get on a nice little run.\" Grade: C+\nT40. Vijay Singh (-5): Amid outside criticism for using his career money list exemption this season, the soon-to-be 63-year-old beat players like Brian Harman, Tom Kim, Collin Morikawa and Keegan Bradley in his first non-major start on the PGA Tour since the 2021 Honda Classic. Spanning even further back, the finish represents Singh's first made cut on the PGA Tour since the 2020 Memorial. It is unknown just how much the three-time major champion will play on the PGA Tour this season (he is not in next week's field at The American Express), but so far so good through the first week. Grade: CMC. Collin Morikawa: On a golf course that was perfect for him on paper, Morikawa penned an underwhelming two-round performance. The two-time major champion struggled with his swing in the calm conditions Thursday morning and watched as his putting problems persisted into Friday afternoon. Morikawa had a chance late in the second round to recover from his opening 72 and make the cut, but a couple of misses from short range across his final three holes were the final nails in his coffin. Grade: F\n            ",

Only five teams have clinched their places in the knockout stage, but none have clinched places in the top eight, which will secure passage directly to the round of 16. Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, and Atalanta are through to the knockouts no matter what happens, but 19 teams still need to join them. Also, with only two matchdays remaining, no team has been eliminated from knockout stage contention in what has been an extremely competitive league phase so far.Major changes have happened during the break in UCL action, with Chelsea and Real Madrid both entering matchday seven with different managers than they finished matchday six with. More changes could be on the way as well with other clubs like Tottenham struggling in league play, but more places in the knockouts will be clinched during matchday seven, and all the action can be

    "body": "\n        Jarrett Stidham is not entering uncharted waters as a backup quarterback starting an NFL playoff game. Ironically, the Denver Broncos' opponent in Sunday's AFC Championship Game, the New England Patriots, fell to a backup QB eight years ago in Super Bowl LII.Stidham will start in place of Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury during the final moments of Denver's win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Divisional Round. Nick Foles, who replaced Carson Wentz and started the Super Bowl for the Eagles after the 2017 season, reminded Broncos fans that history suggests they should be encouraged ... while trolling the Patriots by recalling a game they would rather forget.\"Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours,\" Foles wrote on social media. \"I feel for Bo and the team, and I'm sending prayers for a strong recovery.   A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.\"\nBroncos fans would certainly love it if Stidham had a performance similar to the one Foles put together against New England on football's biggest stage. Foles went 28 of 43 for 377 yards and three touchdowns that night, leading Philadelphia to a 41-33 win over the then-defending Super Bowl champions.Foles' MVP performance also included being on the receiving end of the \"Philly Special\" that instantly became part of Super Bowl lore. \nWhile Stidham will be in a similar spot this Sunday, there are a few clear differences between his situation and the one Foles found himself in eight years ago. \nFoles had been entrenched in the Eagles' starting lineup for roughly six weeks before facing the Patriots in the Super Bowl. That stretch included five starts and two playoff games. Conversely, Sunday will mark Stidham's first extended playing time in a non-exhibition game since the 2023 season. In fact, Stidham hasn't even thrown a pass in a non-exhibition game in over two years.\nFoles' performance also came in the backdrop of Bill Belichick's baffling decision to bench cornerback Malcolm Butler, the hero during the Patriots' Super Bowl win over the Seattle Seahawks three years earlier. It's rather unlikely that current New England coach Mike Vrabel will be benching any of his star defenders next Sunday against Stidham. However, while Foles faced the Patriots on a neutral site, Stidham will benefit from the friendly confines and altitude of Empower Field at Mile High. Rest assured that the Broncos' faithful will give Stidham the silence he needs to run the Broncos' offense while going into a frenzied pitch anytime Patriots QB Drake Maye is on the field. \nStidham appears to have the belief of his teammates and coaches, including Broncos head man Sean Payton. \"He will be ready to go and ready for the moment,\" Payton said following Denver's win over Buffalo. \"[Stidham's] great strength is his mental aptitude and his progressions in understanding plays. … He's very accurate. He has a lot to his ball.\"Payton alluded to Foles and former New York Giants QB Jeff Hostetler, who relieved injured starter Phil Simms late in the 1990 season before leading New York to an upset win over the Bills in Super Bowl XXV. \n\"Historically speaking, all bets weren't off with Hostetler, [and] they weren't off in Philly [with Foles],\" Payton said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- With a deadline looming Friday, executives with the College Football Playoff did not reach a decision Sunday on whether to expand the tournament after a lengthy, in-person meeting on the eve of the national championship game.The four power conference commissioners met Sunday morning but made no headway in negotiations on whether to expand the 12-team playoff to 16 or 24 teams. The Big Ten and SEC, which control voting power among the 10 FBS conferences and Notre Dame, continue to disagree on the expansion format. The Big Ten prefers 24 teams, while the SEC continues to stick with a 16-team format.Commissioners hurriedly exited meetings Sunday as reporters crowded a lobby inside the Loews Hotel in Miami Beach.\"Still more work to do,\" Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti said as he breezed past reporters. \"Not done working.\" \nAmerican commissioner Tim Pernetti was a bit more direct.\"That's up to two people in the room,\" he said, referencing the Big Ten and SEC's months-long disagreements.CFP leaders have been at an impasse for most of the last calendar year, though every power conference wants to expand the field from 12 teams starting with the 2026 season. ESPN, the CFP's broadcast partner through 2032, granted playoff executives an extended deadline from Dec. 1 to Jan. 23. It's possible -- but unlikely -- that executives agree on an expanded format before Friday. If they do not, the postseason tournament will remain at 12 teams.ESPN has made it clear to the CFP that it will not extend the deadline again, CFP executive director Rich Clark confirmed Sunday. Commissioners had not yet scheduled a follow-up meeting this week as of Sunday afternoon, Clark said.\nMaking things more interesting is that any decision may only be a one-year plan. The CFP's executives are free to change the format each season, according to its contract with ESPN, the CFP confirmed Sunday.The CFP's new, six-year contract with ESPN through 2032 does not require a static format for the length of the deal, allowing executives the freedom to change the format on an annual basis if they desire, though each decision must be made before Dec. 1 of each calendar year, said Mark Keenum, chair of the CFP's Board of Managers. \"But that decision will rest in the hands of, again, the commissioners,\" Keenum said. \"They will decide and assess the landscape, fans, all the things that go into it. There are member schools, there are members that they represent, and they'll decide what they think is the best interest for college football going forward.\n\"So, if the decision is to stay at 12 next Friday, that doesn't mean you're locked in for some extended period of time. It can change over the course of this next year and have a different format.\"Fans have grown frustrated with the lack of finality on the format after a year of back-and-forth among executives. Keenum, however, was quick to remind commissioners that it took five years for the CFP to decide to expand from four teams to 12, starting with the 2024 season.\"The fact that we're having conversations is a good thing,\" Keenum said.Fan feedback on this season's 12-team playoff games has been positive, according to the CFP.\n\"I know that there's always going to be some fan that doesn't love the bracket when it comes out,\" Clark said. \"We will never have 100% agreement that we got it right -- that will never happen -- but I do think that fans are really happy with the playoff and how it's going. And whatever decision the commissioners make, it's a way to make it better.\"A 12-team format in 2026, however, would also include different protocols. The four champions from the power conferences, the highest-ranked Group of 5 champion, and Notre Dame, If It finishes ranked in the selection committee's top 12, would be assured spots. The provision for Notre Dame was not Included In the previous contract.CBS Sports reported last week that the Big Ten has floated a compromise to the power conferences that would allow a transition period from a 16-team format to a 24-team format. The 16-team field would be temporary, possibly lasting up to three years. The stopgap would buy conferences time to unwind one of the sport's most complicated obstacles: conference championship games, which are tied up in lucrative and overlapping media rights agreements through at least the end of the decade. The belief is that power conferences would eliminate their conference championship games in the new model.\n\n        \n            \n                As CFP expansion decision looms, Big Ten floats temporary 16-team field as stopgap amid stalemate with SEC\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe power conferences, however, are not yet biting on the Big Ten's proposal.The ACC, Big 12 and SEC continue to back a 16-team \"5+11\" format that guarantees automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions. The roadblock remains the Big Ten and SEC's controlling interest in CFP decision-making. If the two largest conferences don't align, the playoff stays at 12 teams.The Big Ten has strongly favored a 24-team field since August.The Big Ten has also explored a different version of a 24-team playoff -- one with just one automatic qualifier reserved for the highest-ranked Group of Six champion with the remaining 23 teams seeded strictly by CFP Rankings. The thinking is that a largely open field could entice the SEC, sources familiar with the Big Ten's thinking told CBS Sports.A 24-team field with four automatic qualifiers for each of the four power conferences was also discussed within the Big Ten, which was socialized with the FBS members. The ACC and Big 12 have long requested equal access, including qualifiers, for every power conference. A 16-team format with unequal AQs -- four for the Big Ten and SEC, and two for the ACC and Big 12 -- did not gain traction last spring and summer.\nOne Big Ten concept would include 16 on-campus games across the first two rounds, with eight byes awarded to the highest-ranked teams.Quarterfinals and semifinals would remain at marquee bowl sites -- including the Fiesta, Peach, Sugar, Orange and Cotton bowls -- while an expanded neutral-site slate could pull lower-tier bowls into the playoff ecosystem. An increase from seven to 11 neutral-site games would suddenly make the idea of a Pop-Tarts Bowl playoff game plausible.What is losing momentum is replacing conference championship games with playoff play-ins.\nOne 24-team concept would require asking Army and Navy to move their annual rivalry game from the second Saturday in December to the first Saturday. The plan has been rebuffed by both academies and President Donald Trump, who on Saturday said he plans to issue an executive order barring the movement of the game's date while also providing a four-hour exclusive broadcast window for the game.\"We saw it and understand where the administration's position is,\" CFP executive director Rich Clark said Sunday.A 16-team format proposal could include two play-in games, sandwiching the Army-Navy broadcast on CBS, without interfering with the four-hour exclusive window. A 24-team field would likely require Army-Navy to move its game up a week, but CFP executives expressed sensitivity to the issue behind closed doors, sources told CBS Sports.\n            ",

He has supported the \"Free Palestine\" movement in past seasons through the NFL's \"My Cause, My Cleats\" initiative, which permits players to highlight social issues and nonprofit organizations during select games.\"If my platform can bring even a little hope to families in Palestine, then that is what I want to use it for,\" Al-Shaair said earlier this season.The Texans selected Al-Shaair earlier this season as their club winner for the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which is given annually to a player who demonstrates excellence on the field and a significant commitment to philanthropy and community service off the field.\nAl-Shaair earned his first Pro Bowl selection this season after racking up 103 tackles, nine passes defended, a forced fumble and a career-high two interceptions. The second-year Texan is a former undrafted free agent who has blossomed into one of the NFL's most outstanding linebackers across stints with the San Francisco 49ers, Tennessee Titans and Texans.Personal messages are prohibited unless approved ahead of time by the league office. The NFL does not grant permission for players to convey messages pertaining to \"political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns,\" according to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 8 of the league rulebook.\nThe first offense constitutes an $11,593 fine.

    "body": "\n        Miami will be without its top pass defender for the first half of Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship due to a rule that coach Mario Cristobal said \"certainly\" needs to be revisited. Xavier Lucas is suspended for two quarters after being flagged for targeting in the second half of the semifinal win over Ole Miss.At the end of an 11-yard passing play in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl, Lucas launched himself into Ole Miss wide receiver Cayden Lee and made forceful contact with Lee's helmet on the tackle. The officials called Lucas for targeting, ejected him from the game and issued a 15-yard penalty on the Hurricanes. The call stood after review.\"We feel it was unjustly administered, and now it impacts the last game of the season,\" Cristobal said at Sunday's joint press conference with Indiana coach Curt Cignetti. \"We do have the ability, again, as an officiating crew and the powers that be to revisit that to give every team due process and their best ability to compete in this game.\"Here is the play in question:\nWhile Lucas' ejection did not cost Miami the game, the resulting suspension could prove problematic for the Hurricanes when they square off against an elite passing offense in the national championship game. If Indiana builds the same kind of commanding lead it enjoyed in its previous two playoff victories, Lucas' return to action in the second half may be too little, too late for Miami.The suspension element of the targeting rule has long been a point of contention and is back under the microscope because of the high-profile nature of Lucas' looming absence. That one of the best players in the national championship matchup must sit because of a penalty from a separate game could be what it takes to start a meaningful conversation about changing the rule.Had Lucas committed the targeting penalty in the first half of the Fiesta Bowl, he would have sat the rest of that game and been eligible to play the entirety of the national championship. Many opponents of the rule argue that targeting should not constitute an ejection in the first place, let alone an automatic suspension for the following game if it occurs after halftime.\nThe unfortunate reality for Miami is that it must shuffle its defensive backfield for the first 30 minutes of the most important game of the year. Lucas leads the Hurricanes with eight pass breakups on the year, and he has an interception, forced fumble and sack to his name, as well. The outstanding coverage man figures to give Miami a jolt when he enters the lineup in the third quarter, but he will have to hope in the meantime that his teammates can contain Omar Cooper Jr., Elijah Sarratt and the rest of an uber-productive Indiana receiving corps.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At long last, DJ Lagway has made a decision regarding his plans for the upcoming football season. The former Florida Gators' sophomore quarterback is signing with Baylor 10 days after he had committed to them. A former five-star recruit, the 6-foot-3, 247-pound Lagway entered the transfer portal on Dec. 15 following two seasons at Florida. He had early visits with Florida State and Virginia before visiting Ole Miss after Trinidad Chambliss was denied a sixth season of eligibility. There were also rumblings that Duke could be in the mix for Lagway's services after Darian Mensah entered the transfer portal at the 11th hour. In the end, though, the 20-year-old Lagway has decided to sign with Baylor while following in the footsteps of his father, Derek, who played running back for the Bears from 1997-01. While he showed flashes of his potential at Florida, injuries prevented Lagway from having more success during his time with the Gators. Multiple injuries, for example, prevented him from taking part in Florida's spring practices ahead of the 2025 season. A calf issue that was sustained in July further hindered his practice availability. Those injuries and the subsequent loss of practice time undoubtedly impacted Lagway's effectiveness once the 2025 season began. He and the Gators endured a 1-3 start to the season that included a 20-10 loss to LSU that saw Lagway throw a season-high five interceptions. \nLagway finished the season with 2,264 yards and 16 touchdowns while completing 63.2% of his passes. He also threw an SEC-high 14 picks for the Gators, who finished the season with a 4-8 record. Lagway showed his potential at the end of the 2024 season by leading the Gators to four straight wins that included throwing for a season-high 305 yards in a 33-8 win over Tulane in the Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl. He also led the Gators' to wins over then-ranked LSU and Ole Miss before Florida defeated rival Florida State in their regular season finale. A former USA Today Offensive Player of the Year, Lagway was named Mr. Texas Football in 2023 after throwing for 4,631 yards and a Texas 6A record 58 touchdown passes during his senior season. He also ran for 975 yards and 15 touchdowns while showcasing his impressive versatility. \nLagway will be going to a Baylor team that went 5-7 last season and 3-6 in the Big 12. Despite last year's struggles, the school decided to retain coach Dave Aranda, who went 36-37 during his first six seasons with the Bears. His best season with the Bears took place back in 2021, when he lead Baylor to a 12-2 record that was capped off by Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        No postseason has had more chaotic finishes than the 2025 playoffs going on right now. There have been 15 fourth-quarter lead changes and five comeback wins in the final three minutes this postseason, the most in a single playoffs all-time, according to CBS Sports Research.Despite all the chaos, the conference championship games for both the AFC and the NFC are somewhat chalky. The AFC features a matchup between the conference's two top seed's, the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos, while the NFC showcases its top seed, the Seattle Seahawks, against the team with the second-best record in the conference, the Los Angeles Rams. Even though the heavyweights reached the NFL's final four, the 2025 slate features the second-widest experience gap between the remaining teams' starting quarterbacks in the league's postseason history. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford (251 career starts) has started 124 more games than Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye and Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham combined (127 combined starts). Only Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (286 career starts) had a larger gap over his three remaining conference championship quarterback peers in the 2017 season when he had 143 more starts than Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, Minnesota Vikings quarterback Case Keenum and Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles (143 combined starts). So what will happen in the 2025 conference championship games? Enjoy a couple early breakdowns and predictions to kick off your week. \nAFC: New England Patriots (2) at Denver Broncos (1)The quarterback matchup for this game went from a bragging rights battle for the 2024 NFL Draft's third overall pick, New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, and the 2024 NFL Draft's 12th overall pick, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, to bragging rights between two quarterbacks drafted by the Patriots. Broncos backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will be filling in as Denver's starter with Nix now out for the season after fracturing a bone in his ankle on the second to last play of the Broncos' 33-30 overtime win in the divisional round over the Buffalo Bills. Stidham, a 2019 fourth-round pick by New England, was actually set to enter training camp as the Patriots' starting quarterback after Tom Brady's free agency departure to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Then, New England signed Cam Newton just before training camp began. He'll now be the first quarterback ever to start a conference championship game against the team that drafted him. He'll have his work cut for him with the way the Patriots defense is playing at the moment. New England possesses more playoff wins (two) than touchdowns allowed (one) this postseason. Their one touchdown allowed is tied for the fewest touchdowns allowed across the wild card and divisional rounds in the 21st century. The other two teams who have also done the same, the 2000 Baltimore Ravens and the 2006 Indianapolis Colts, both went on to win the Super Bowl. The Patriots turned the Texans over a whopping five times on Sunday afternoon, and they continuously got their hands on the football. New England's 14 passes defended stands as the most by any team in a postseason game since the 2004 Philadelphia Eagles' 17 in the divisional round against the Minnesota Vikings. \nHowever, the Broncos are the NFL's best pass rush, finishing the regular season with an NFL-most 68 sacks, 11 more than the second-place Atlanta Falcons' 57. Denver defensive coordinator Vance Joseph isn't afraid to bring the heat, blitzing at the fifth-highest rate (33.9%) in the regular season. The Broncos' pass rush could put Maye in the danger zone after he's absorbed five sacks in both the wild card and divisional rounds. Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, the 2025 NFL Draft fourth overall pick, is struggling this postseason with nine sacks and 30 quarterback pressures allowed in two games. Where to watch Patriots vs. Broncos liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High (Denver)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -5.5, O/U 40.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nEarly Patriots vs. Broncos prediction, pickMaye, the 2025 second-team All-Pro quarterback, makes many more big time throws than Stidham despite both facing top tier defenses. Of the previous six quarterbacks to make their first start of a season in the playoffs, only one (Buffalo Bills backup Frank Reich) won a game. Reich famously led the Bills to the largest comeback in NFL postseason history, 32 points, in the 1992 wild card round against the Houston Oilers. The odds are New England escapes Mile High with a multi-score victory given the vast disparity in what each team's quarterback has accomplished this season. Early pick: Patriots 27, Broncos 13 | Patriots -5.5, Under 40.5  \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff winners and losers for divisional round: Josh Allen's, Bo Nix's years over; C.J.

The home team has won both matchups thus far this season. Los Angeles triumphed 21-19 in Week 11 at SoFi Stadium after Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold tossed a career-high four interceptions. In Week 16 at Lumen Field, the Seahawks erased a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit (30-14) to roar all the way back for a 38-37 overtime victory. Los Angeles fired special teams coordinator Chris Blackburn two days after that defeat in which Rashid Shaheed's 58-yard punt return touchdown sparked Seattle's comeback. \nThe Sunday showdown in the NFC Championship marks the ninth playoff game in the conference championship round or Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger between the No. 1 scoring offense -- the Rams led the NFL with 30.5 points per game in 2025 and the No. 1 scoring defense -- the Seahawks led the NFL with 17.2 points per game allowed in 2025. It's worth noting the No. 1 defense has triumphed over the No. 1 offense in seven of the prior eight such matchups. No. 1 scoring offense vs. No. 1 scoring defense, conference championship game or later, Since 1970 OffenseDefense2025 NFC ChampionshipRamsSeahawks2016 Super Bowl FalconsPatriots*2014 NFC ChampionshipPackersSeahawks*2013 Super BowlBroncosSeahawks*1990 Super BowlBillsGiants*1989 Super Bowl49ers*Broncos1984 Super BowlDolphins49ers*1980 NFC ChampionshipCowboysEagles*1978 Super Bowl CowboysSteelers** Won gameWhere to watch Rams vs. Seahawks liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field (Seattle)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nEarly Rams vs. Seahawks prediction, pickBoth of the 2025 matchups between these teams have been so close. The Rams won by two points in Week 11, and the Seahawks won by a single point in overtime in Week 16. Both Rams head coach Sean McVay's offense and Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald's defenses have been incredible this season. However, if there's one quarterback who could make a big mistake in this game, it's Darnold. He led the league with 20 turnovers in the regular season, and he's struggled with Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula's defense across his last three games against Los Angeles dating to the 2024 NFC wild card round with the Minnesota Vikings. That night, Darnold absorbed an NFL playoff record nine sacks in a 27-9 defeat. Fast forward to today, and Darnold has an oblique injury. He wasn't nearly as mobile in the pocket in Seattle's 41-6 divisional round win against the San Francisco 49ers because of the ailment. Given his history against the Rams and his current health situation, Los Angeles wins the NFC Championship by a field goal. Sam Darnold's last three games vs. Rams, span begins in 2024 wild card round with VikingsStatsCompletion pct64.4%Pass TD-Turnovers3-8Passer rating67.5Times sacked13** Includes nine sacks in 2024 wild card round loss with Vikings, tied for the most in a playoff game in NFL historyEarly pick: Rams 24, Seahawks 21 | Rams +2.5, Under 47.5  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Caleb Williams has produced off plenty of miraculous moments in the Chicago Bears' magical run this season. His latest escape act might just be his greatest. It also might have used up his seemingly endless reserve of magic.On a fourth-and-4 from the Los Angeles Rams' 9-yard line, Williams retreated all the way back to the 40-yard line before tossing up a perfect pass to tight end Cole Kmet for a game-tying touchdown.Kmet got himself open with a bit of hand fighting, allowing Williams' pass to land right in his bread basket on a last-gasp effort from Chicago. The touchdown tied Sunday night's game 17-17, though Los Angeles rallied in overtime to kick a walk-off field goal and win, 20-17, advancing to the NFC Championship.\nThe overhead view provides another perspective on Williams' wild throw. His protection fell apart almost instantaneously, and he had his back fully turned to the play before gathering himself and delivering the ball more than 51 yards through the air.\nAnd how about this field-level view?\nThe videos still somehow only does it partial justice. NFL Next Gen Stats specifies that Williams' 14-yard completion traveled 51.2 air yards, making it the \"longest\" completion in the red zone since at least 2016.That was as good as it got for the 2024 No. 1 pick out of USC. In overtime, the Bears' defense got a stop, setting up Williams and co. for a potential game-winning drive. Instead, Williams threw his third interception of the night, with Kamren Curl stepping in front of a deep pass intended for DJ Moore and making a remarkable diving, bobbling catch.\nMatthew Stafford then drove the Rams into field goal range, and Harrison Mevis delivered the game-winning field goal. The Rams will face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship.\nFor Williams, it ends an impressive bounce-back campaign after a tough rookie season. He had seven fourth-quarter comebacks this season (including the postseason), one shy of tying the single-season record. Last week in the Wild Card Round against the Green Bay Packers, he made a similarly incredible fourth-down play as the Bears, who trailed 21-6, won 31-27.\nThe Bears finished with an NFL-record seven wins in games they trailed in the final two minutes of regulation.But living in such small margins also meant mistakes like the one Williams made in overtime were devastating, and one of Williams' next steps will be limiting those mistakes. Though he was generally safe with the ball this season, Williams' accuracy inconsistencies continued to rear their ugly head, and they did so again in the worst moment Sunday. Williams had a 14.6% off-target rate this season, the highest in the NFL.\nSunday night's game proved to be a microcosm of the season as a whole: many tremendous highs and some frustrating lows. The biggest difference? The Bears ended up on the wrong side of the scoreboard.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When New York Knicks forward Karl-Anthony Towns put up a 3-pointer with about a minute left against the Phoenix Suns Saturday night to try and cut into the vistors' seven-point lead, Knicks fans inside Madison Square Garden were cheering in anticipation in what could've been the spark to ignite a comeback. But the shot sailed wide left, missing everything and landing out of bounds.Fans began booing the Knicks, and the players' body language following the airball showed visible frustration as they were headed for their third consecutive loss, and eighth in their last 10 games.\nAfter the game, Knicks coach Mike Brown sided with the fans in their booing, saying \"the fans have every right to boo\" after another disappointing loss.If the Knicks' resolution for the new year was to win an NBA championship, this certainly isn't inspiring confidence of that happening. They have a 2-7 record in January, and the only team with a worse record is the Utah Jazz, a team that has just 14 wins on the season. \nWhile it may seem like just a rough patch in a long season, in the history of the league there haven't been a significant number of instances where a team has gone 2-8 at any point in the regular season and went on to win a championship. In fact, only six NBA champions have ever done that, per CBS Sports' research department.NBA Finals teams with 2-8 span in same seasonSeasonTeamResult2021-22Golden State WarriorsWon Finals2017-18Cleveland CavaliersLost Finals2014-15Cleveland CavaliersLost Finals2010-11Dallas MavericksWon Finals2003-04Detroit PistonsWon Finals1980-81Houston RocketsLost Finals1977-78Washington BulletsWon Finals1977-78Seattle SuperSonicsLost Finals1975-76Phoenix SunsLost Finals1974-75Golden State WarriorsWon Finals1970-71Baltimore BulletsLost Finals1969-70Los Angeles LakersLost Finals1966-67San Francisco WarriorsLost Finals1962-63Los Angeles LakersLost Finals1958-59Minneapolis LakersLost Finals1956-57St. Louis HawksLost Finals1951-52New York KnicksLost Finals1947-48Baltimore BulletsWon FinalsThe last team to do it was the 2021-22 Warriors, who had the greatest shooter in NBA history on their team in Stephen Curry and caught fire in the NBA Finals en route to his first Finals MVP. That's not to say the Knicks can't rebound from this poor showing, and there's certainly tons of evidence showing that a team can still make the Finals despite having a 2-8 span. But the Knicks don't want to just get a participation trophy for getting to the NBA Finals, the goal is to hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy in June.So what's been going on with this team as of late? Jalen Brunson's has missed the last two games with an ankle injury, which certainly doesn't help matters. But even with Brunson back fully healthy, he's not covering up the biggest issue plaguing the Knicks this season.The defense has been awfulThe Knicks have no problem putting points on the board. Yes, in this 10-game rough patch they've fallen from a third-best offense all season to 21st, but that can be explained by a matter of shooting variance. The Knicks have been the third-best 3-point shooting team all season, but in January that's fallen to 23rd. They're still getting up roughly the same number of 3s per game (around 39 per game), so no one's taking that shot away from them, but the efficiency has dipped. Mikal Bridges, who has hovered around 43.1% on his 3s through the first three months, has fallen to 35.6% in January. Across December and January, OG Anunoby has been ice cold from deep.Because of that poor shooting there's been a tendency to over-rely on Brunson's ability to take a defender one-on-one, which creates a more stagnant offense, but those are easier fixes. And we've seen the Knicks cut down on the isolation attempts this season compared to the last few years where the gameplan was typically just letting Brunson dominate the ball and either take it himself, or collapse the defense and kick it out to a shooter. There's room for the offense to bounce back.The defense, however, hasn't been good at all this season. What was once a calling card for New York has now become its Achilles heel. The team rank is 19th in defense, and over the last 10 games, that's been even worse, as only the lowly Jazz have allowed more points than the blue and orange during this pitiful stretch.Part of the issue can be summed up by this single possession in a recent 112-101 road loss to the Kings.\nBrown called Towns out for his lack of urgency to get back on defense, as well as several other instances not just by him, but by the whole team. \"When you fall down, you got to get up,\" Brown said after the game. \"You got to sprint down the floor, and even if you're the last guy down the floor, you got to get down there, just in case there's a long rebound. But there was no urgency. Now, that wasn't the only play. There were a handful of plays where we did that, but there was no sense urgency on that particular play to get back. And it was a five-point swing.\"Against the Warriors, the Knicks built up a 17-point lead in the first quarter, and then things began to fall apart defensively. There was no communication to make up for breakdowns in rotations, and they were caught sleeping on a number of occasions that created easy backdoor cuts for the Warriors.Jimmy Butler took over in that game doing typically Jimmy Butler stuff. He's going to outwork you, he's going to fight for second and third scoring opportunities and make life difficult for you on the other end. The Knicks have great individual defenders in Bridges, Anunoby and Hart, but, as a team, the constant breakdowns make this group vulnerable.They're one of the worst teams at defending the 3-point line. Opponents are shooting 37.3% on 3s this season against the Knicks, which has increased to 39% in the last 10 games. Guys aren't putting in effort to close out on the perimeter, as most of the 3s opponents take against the Knicks are coming on wide-open looks.Knicks' 3-point defense, 2025-26 seasonClosest defenderFrequency (%)3PA/G3P%/G0-2 feet (Very tight)0.2%0.242.9%2-4 feet (Tight)4.3%3.833.5%4-6 feet (Open)17.6%15.336.5%6+ feet (Wide open)22.9%19.938.7%Brown predicted his team's defensive struggles a few weeks ago after a win against the Pelicans, where where the Knicks narrowly escaped with a five-point victory against a New Orleans team that to that point in the season had only won eight games.\"We haven't figured out how to be physical for 48 minutes in the last I don't know how many games,\" Brown said. \"We pick up some some silly fouls that we have to do a better job of. I feel everybody understands that, but now we just have to go do it. Our physicality is not good. I don't know if we're tired or what, but we have not been able to sustain anything defensively for 48 minutes. We've won a lot of games, and you want to win games, and you feel good about it. But at the end of the day, if we don't figure out how to sustain what we're supposed to do on the defensive end of the floor for 48 minutes it's going to be a long year for us, and it's going to eventually catch up to us.\"Just two and a half weeks after Brown said that and it's already caught up to the Knicks in the worst way possible.Should the Knicks be concerned?Absolutely. If they can't figure out their defensive issues, then forget winning a championship, they could get taken out far before then if they're not careful. Sure, teams have been known to flip a switch when the postseason rolls around, and the Knicks could certainly become more engaged with the motivation of winning a title fueling them. But right now is when that should be put into practice. If this worrying trend doesn't turn itself around, it could be an issue the Knicks try to address on the trade market. There's been trade rumors in the past connecting the Knicks and Giannis Antetokounmpo, and he'd certainly cover up a ton of weaknesses defensively. The Knicks have also been attached to Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado, whose made a name for himself as an all-out effort guy who is also a defensive pest. Think of him as another Josh Hart out there, which something that the Knicks would certainly love.If there's not a trade that materializes, then the Knicks will have to look in the mirror and figure out how to mitigate this issue from within. Otherwise they could be the next in a long list of teams who might make the Finals, but fall short of capturing a title because their defense just isn't up to the task.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Richardson, one of the NFL's most physically tantalizing quarterbacks, is now available via trade. The Indianapolis Colts reportedly gave the fourth overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft permission to pursue a trade. The 23-year-old was beaten out in a training camp battle with Daniel Jones last preseason, and the Colts are expected to re-sign Jones to a multi-year contract this offseason. Richardson has a small body of work across three seasons in the NFL, playing just 17 games with 15 of them being starts. A shoulder injury cut his rookie year short after four games. A combination of hip, back and foot injuries limited Richardson to 11 games and he only threw two passes in 2025. A freak eye injury he suffered in warmups prior to the Colts' Week 6 game caused an orbital fracture that necessitated surgery after an accident with a resistance band. Richardson has completed 50.6% of his passes for 2,400 yards, 11 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions in his 17 games of work.Richardson's rocket launcher right arm is why he'll certainly garner interest on the trade market: he led the NFL with a 14.4 yards per completion average in 2024. However, he's also a project as he completed just 47.7% of his passes that year, the worst completion percentage in a season since Tim Tebow completed just 46.5% of his throws for the Denver Broncos in 2011. That makes Richardson the first player to rank first in yards per completion and last in completion percentage in the same season since Heath Shuler in 1994. \n        \n            \n                Najee Harris landing spots: Super Bowl champion Seahawks among possible fits for former Pro Bowl running back\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich teams could be interested enough to take the plunge required to trade for the former top-five pick quarterback as he enters the fourth and final season of his rookie deal? Let's take a look at five possible landing spots.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Vikings Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell helped revive the careers of two other former top 10 pick quarterbacks in Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones in 2024 only to see both of them walk in free agency. Darnold went on to win Super Bowl LX in his first season with the Seattle Seahawks, and Jones was in the NFL MVP conversation in the first half of the 2025 season before injuries derailed him.O'Connell let both of those guys out of his building because he had the 2024 10th overall pick in quarterback J.J. McCarthy waiting in the wings. However, his first year as an NFL starting quarterback can be described as highly concerning. McCarthy ranked dead last in the NFL in completion percentage (58%), touchdown-interception (11-12) and passer rating (72.6) in 2025 despite working with O'Connell and being able to throw passes to 2022 NFL Offensive Player of the Year wide receiver Justin Jefferson. Perhaps Minnesota would be interested in bringing in another formerly highly-touted prospect to push and/or overtake McCarthy. When mic'd up in a game in which the Vikings played the Colts, O'Connell gave Richardson an extended pep talk. The interest in Richardson could very well still exist for the Vikings now.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles RamsMatthew Stafford, the 2025 NFL MVP, is 38-years-old. He certainly isn't looking to retire in 2026 after leading the league in passing yards (4,707) and passing touchdowns (46) in 2025. However, it could be prudent for Los Angeles to begin building a contingency plan for life after Stafford. A quarterback with Richardson's eye-popping traits working with one of the NFL's top scheme lords could bring the 23-year-old's pro career back to life, and he could allow Los Angeles to not skip a beat post-Stafford after some refinement with McVay. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersAaron Rodgers is 42-years-old and set to be a free agent in March. The Pittsburgh Steelers need to be planning for life after Rodgers as early as 2026. Trading for Richardson and having him rebuild his fundamentals with new Steelers head coach Mike McCarthy could be an ideal situation for the 23-year-old. McCarthy famously helped Rodgers tweak his mechanics in the NFL, which helped transform him into a Super Bowl and league MVP. Perhaps McCarthy could rebuild Richardson in his \"QB school\" program, which could result in big plays downfield to two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver DK Metcalf.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons are loaded with offensive talent with 2025 first team All-Pro running back Bijan Robinson, former top-10 pick wide receiver Drake London and 2025 second-team All-Pro tight end Kyle Pitts. All they need is a long-term solution at the quarterback position. \nKirk Cousins is expected to be released in March, and the 2024 eighth overall pick quarterback Michael Penix Jr. suffered the third ACL tear of his football career, his first in the NFL, in Week 11 against the Carolina Panthers. Penix might not even be ready to roll for Week 1 this season. Richardson is two years younger than Penix, so he could be a tantalizing option for new head coach Kevin Stefanski and new president of football operations Matt Ryan. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins The Miami Dolphins are Green Bay Packers South after hiring Green Bay defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley as their new head coach and Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan as their new general manager. Both of them witnessed the rehabilitation of 2022 third-round pick quarterback Malik Willis in Green Bay across the last two seasons, and he will now be a sought-after free agent this offseason. Perhaps they will try to hit the jackpot again with an athletic quarterback project by trading for Richardson, as Tua Tagovailoa's time as the Dolphins' starting quarterback seemingly comes to an end in the near future.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While he missed the entire 2025 college football season with a torn ACL, Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy remains perhaps the best cornerback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft class, and he said he is recovered from the injury that held him out during his final year with the Volunteers. His return to full strength opens the door for a potential first-round selection even though he only has two years of college production to his name.Despite being cleared and having \"no limits\" physically, McCoy will not participate at this week's NFL Scouting Combine. He will, however, complete workouts at Tennessee's pro day. McCoy said he elected to pass on the combine because he wants more training time as he seeks to put the best product on the field.\"I was just easing into my training out of college and just trying to make sure everything was good,\" McCoy said at the combine. \"The plan from the jump was for me to do pro day, do all my medicals and stuff to show that I'm healthy.\"McCoy's medicals are one of the biggest storylines at the combine. If all checks out, he could very well be one of the first defensive players taken in April's draft. Any concern over his knee would be grounds for a slide down the board.\nThe cautious approach McCoy took in 2025 could pay off in the form of ideal medical evaluation results. He said he made a push to get back onto the field last season at Tennessee, but while he was cleared to return, he did not feel ready to compete. That did not stop him from declaring for the draft, though, and the film he produced over one year at Tennessee and another at Oregon State is enough to warrant first-round projections.\"I got back to training, and I just felt like myself again,\" McCoy said. \"I made a big impact the year that I played. I just felt like I was ready.\"McCoy debuted as a true freshman in 2023 and played in all 12 regular-season games at Oregon State. He was an immediate standout for the Beavers and hauled in two interceptions and a fumble recovery on what was a pleasant surprise of a campaign for the former three-star recruit. That season made him a prized prospect in the 2024 transfer portal, and he made the leap to the SEC with high expectations.\nMcCoy delivered on the buzz with a splendid first year at Tennessee, doubling his interception total with four takeaways in 2024. He broke up an additional nine passes in what ended up being his final year on the college gridiron.\n            ",

The majority of Almeria is still owned by Saudi consortium SMC Group led by Mohamed al-Khereiji, who took over the club in May of last year and currently serves as the president.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\"It has been a long-time ambition of mine to contribute to football,\" Ronaldo said in a statement from CR7 Sports Investments. \"I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club's next phase of growth.\"\nKhereiji suggested in a statement issued by Almeria that Ronaldo would take interest in the club's youth setup, while Rubi, coach of the second division team, said the Portugal international's influence could be wider.\"From our perspective, we're very happy,\" he said. \"Of course, we welcome him. I think it's great news because someone like him, with his extensive knowledge of sport and football, can really help a club like ours.

    "description": "\n        With free agency season less than two weeks away, Najee Harris' representation has provided an update on his recovery from last year's season",
    "body": "\n        With free agency season less than two weeks away, Najee Harris' representation has provided an update on his recovery from last year's season-ending Achilles injury. Harris' agent posted a video of his client running on a treadmill five months after undergoing surgery on his Achilles. While his recovery is impressive, anyone that is familiar with Harris' work ethic shouldn't be surprised. Prior to last season, Harris had never missed an NFL game. His durability allowed him to become the first player in Pittsburgh Steelers history to begin his NFL career with four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. As a rookie, Harris broke Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris' 49-year-old franchise record for rushing yards by a rookie. Harris' durability in Pittsburgh was a testament to his intense training regiment that sometimes included individually training for up to an hour after practice had concluded. One can assume that Harris' work ethic has paid dividends during his recent post-surgery rehabilitation. \nLast season, Harris played in just three games for the Chargers, who signed him to a one-year deal last offseason after the Steelers let him test the open market. Despite missing significant time last summer with an eye injury, Harris played well during his limited time on the field. He averaged a respectable 4.1 yards per carry and caught each of his three targets. \nAt 6-foot-1 and 242 pounds, Harris is a physical back who isn't afraid of contact. While he doesn't have elite speed, Harris has more than enough quickness to get to the outside. He's also an exceptional pass protector and pass-catcher; he caught a career-high 74 passes from Ben Roethlisberger during his standout rookie season. Where will Harris end up next? Here's a rundown of some possible options for the soon-to-be 28-year-old. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Seahawks Harris would make a lot of sense for Seattle if the Seahawks don't re-sign Kenneth Walker, who like Harris is also slated to hit the open market. Walker, though, will likely command a higher salary as he is coming off an MVP performance in Seattle's Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots. Walker's current projected market value is just over $36 million over four years. Harris' projected market value is one year for $2.95 million. It's conceivable that Harris would be able to mimic what Walker has brought to Seattle's offense. While Walker may be slightly more talented and versatile as a runner, Harris is a better pass-catcher. He also wouldn't have an issue sharing the workload with Zach Charbonnet after he was asked to do so in Pittsburgh with Jaylen Warren and Omarion Hampton in Los Angeles. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ers San Francisco was just 24th in the league in rushing in 2025, which was largely a byproduct of not having a more impactful complementary back alongside Christian McCaffrey. Brian Robinson Jr. averaged a solid 4.3 yards per carry, but he carried the ball just 92 times and caught just 8 of 12 targets. Harris would likely have a bigger impact if the 49ers signed him. His presence would likely help limit McCaffrey's workload, would help the 49ers possess the ball more while also taking some of the pressure off of quarterback Brock Purdy. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs Harris makes a lot of sense here with Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt set to become free agents. Last year, the duo of Pacheco and Hunt ran for a combined 1,073 yards but averaged just 3.8 yards per carry. Neither one made much of an impact for Patrick Mahomes in the passing game. \nAfter starting his career with Roethlisberger, Harris would get another chance to work with a future Hall of Fame quarterback in Mahomes, who could certainly use a stable running game if he and the Chiefs want to get back to the NFL's upper echelon. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Texans Houston appears to have a promising young runner in Woody Marks, but it could use some depth behind Marks given Joe Mixon's uncertain future and Nick Chubb slated to enter free agency. With Marks playing on a rookie contract, the Texans can afford to bring in another accomplished running back. Harris' presence would not only help Marks and the running game, it would also undoubtedly help quarterback C.J. Stroud, whose lack of consistency in recent years has contributed to the Texans' inability to get beyond the AFC divisional round. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver Broncos The Broncos are looking to upgrade their running game after finishing 16th in rushing in 2025. Specifically, Denver is looking at outside options to potentially replace J.K. Dobbins, who like Harris is expected to be a free agent. Dobbins played well last season before an injury sidelined him for the season's final seven games. In Denver, Harris would complement RJ Harvey, who was just as valuable during his rookie season as a receiver than as a runner. Harris' presence would likely allow Harvey to continue to thrive in that role. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas Cowboys/Cincinnati BengalsDallas and Cincinnati were lumped together because both could use depth behind their starting running backs. Javonte Williams ran for 1,201 yards last year, but no other Cowboys player ran for over 250 yards. Jaydon Blue, a 2025 fifth-round pick, had only 38 carries while playing in just five games. \nIn Cincinnati, Chase Brown eclipsed 1,000 yards rushing for the first time in his career, but Samaje Perine (382 yards) was the only other Bengals player who ran for over 45 yards. Tahj Brooks, a 2025 sixth-round pick, appeared in 16 games but carried the ball just 16 times for 45 yards. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Royal Rumble in the rear-view mirror, there's only one path to a world championship match at WrestleMania, and that path is winning the Elimination Chamber. The event takes place on Saturday at United Center in Chicago.Six men and six women will enter the Elimination Chamber, with the winners of the men's and women's matches earning their shot at a world title. With men's Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns already choosing world heavyweight champion CM Punk and women's winner Liv Morgan selecting women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer, that leaves WWE champion Drew McIntyre and WWE women's champion Jade Cargill for the Elimination Chamber winners.There are also a pair of title matches set for the Elimination Chamber card, with CM Punk putting his world heavyweight title -- and spot as a WrestleMania headliner -- on the line against Finn Balor, and Punk's wife, AJ Lee, challenging Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental championship.\n        \n            \n                Drew McIntyre reacts to WWE scrapping John Cena match at Crown Jewel: 'I can't change the creative direction'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's take a look at who the CBS Sports experts believe will emerge victorious on Saturday in Chicago.\n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsMen's Elimination Chamber Match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Jey Uso: Many times, picking a winner in a match like this comes down to eliminating who wouldn't be a winner. Evans and Williams aren't currently at the level where they'll be going one-on-one for a world championship at WrestleMania. Orton is a legend, but not one who is in a place where he makes sense as a WrestleMania headliner in 2026. Uso isn't going to have a second consecutive world title match at WrestleMania, and he is a tag champion anyway, giving him other things to be doing. That leaves Knight and Rhodes, only one of whom has an ongoing issue -- which some may say has been ongoing for far too long -- with McIntyre. That makes the outcome seem fairly obvious. Pick: Cody Rhodes wins -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)Women's Elimination Chamber Match -- Tiffany Stratton vs. Rhea Ripley vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: The winner of this match will challenge WWE women's champion Jade Cargill at WrestleMania. Those stakes help narrow the field. The champ looks like a box office star, so WWE should pick a challenger with star power and experience. Asuka and Cargill are both heels, and while that sometimes works, it doesn't gel well here. Bliss fits the bill, but she's more interesting teaming with Charlotte Flair. Ripley vs. Cargill screams WrestleMania, a collision between two of WWE's most powerful women. Ripley's status as women's tag team champion complicates things, but there's more upside here than retreading Cargill vs. Stratton. Pick: Ripley wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)World Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: It's nice to see Balor positioned like a major player once again, and equally nice that it is signaling the end of his time in Judgment Day, but there's just no way WWE pivots from Punk vs. Reigns at WrestleMania to Balor vs. Reigns. It was nice to see WWE finally bring up the bizarre ending to Balor vs. Reigns at Extreme Rules 2021, but that's not enough foundation for a WrestleMania main event. Pick: CM Punk retains the title -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)\nWomen's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk will smooth things over for Chicago after a rough start for their adopted hero Lee. The women's intercontinental champion needs a successful title defense, especially with the potential for another showdown at WrestleMania. Lee has wrestled twice in 10 years, beating Lynch in WarGames and a mixed tag team match with their husbands. Expect Lynch to steal a victory through nefarious means ahead of a one-on-one rematch in Las Vegas. Pick: Lynch retains the title -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The LPGA Tour rode a wave of momentum into the 2026 season. Commissioner Craig Kessler inked a new broadcast partnership to ensure every round of every tournament is being shown on television, and that came before the creation of WTGL -- the women's version of TGL -- which continues to see more and more commitments from some of the biggest names in the ladies' game.Outside the ropes, deals are being struck to push the women's game forward. Inside the ropes, however, the LPGA Tour is at a bit of a crossroads.There was a point in 2024 when then-world No. 1 Nelly Korda could not be caught. Literally and figuratively, the smooth-swinging right-hander was heads and shoulders above the competition. While Scottie Scheffler dominated the men's game, Korda did the same on the women's side.Korda became the third player to win five tournaments in a row on the LPGA Tour during a season in which she claimed her second major championship, seven total titles, 11 top 10 finishes in 16 starts and north of $4 million in earnings. \n\"As a golf fan, I think I like seeing a player more dominant because then you want to see what's going to happen next and you follow it,\" 10-time major winner, eight-time LPGA Tour Player of the Year and World Golf Hall of Fame member Annika Sörenstam told CBS Sports. \"I mean, there's always competitors, always somebody pushing, but I love the fact that somebody's standing out and pushing the envelope and taking the game to a different level.\"Some expected Korda to continue her run into 2025, but it never materialized. In fact, she didn't win at all. Instead, the wealth was spread among 29 different winners across the 32-event season. At the midway point, there were more winners (18) than tournaments played (17) due to a team event.\"It's great to have multiple winners because you learn different people's games, different personalities that are out there,\" said 11-time LPGA Tour winner Lexi Thompson. \"Of course, it is great to have someone go on a run like Tiger [Woods] or what Nelly did. It's great to see that, but to see different faces be part of the game and to win or get their first win is a huge moment for the game.\"\nThe last two years beg the question: Is dominance or parity better for the game? Would the LPGA Tour benefit from one of its players rising above the rest of the competition like Korda did in 2024, or is the unknown of which player will win any given week able to keep driving the sport on?With all of the improvements surrounding the actual golf being played, the 2026 season may ultimately reveal the answer. \"I think sport needs dominant players; I think sport needs a rivalry,\" said 16-year veteran Mel Reid. \"It's very easy to have rivalries with football teams, soccer teams, hockey teams, rugby teams and basketball teams. In golf, you need some sort of either rivalry or an extremely dominant player. \n\"For me, a season like last season proves that (1) there are incredible players on the LPGA and that anybody can win or the majority of players can win on any given week. (2) I think it shows the talent of the rookies and the players that are coming from Japan, for example. But, at the same time, I am like, 'Why is there not a dominant player? Why isn't power dominating the LPGA? If they really do want to shift the narrative and have a dominant player or even a rivalry, they have to look deeper into it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The PGA Tour schedule shifts East for the Florida Swing beginning this week as the 2026 Cognizant Classic brings the Tour to the Palm Beaches, where players will attempt to tame the Bear Trap at PGA National's Champion Course. After back-to-back signature events -- and another coming next week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational -- many of the world's best will take a week off, which creates an opportunity for those in the field to pick up a win and/or some valuable FedEx Cup points. The betting favorite entering the week is Ryan Gerard, who has a pair of top 10s already this season and picked up his first career win last year at the Barracuda Championship. Other rising stars in the field include Michael Thorbjornsen, the Højgaard twins and Rasmus Neergaard-Peterson, who will all look to get in the winner's circle and add to their strong early-career résumés. They'll be challenged by some veterans looking to get back on track with notable names like Shane Lowry, Daniel Berger, Will Zalatoris, Max Homa, Tom Kim and Brooks Koepka all in the field. They are all looking to get back in the winner's circle and reestablish themselves as threats on the PGA Tour. Koepka is particularly intriguing as he continues his quest for form in his return from LIV Golf. That battle between veterans and rising stars will be fascinating to watch this week at PGA National, and here's how you can watch all of the action this week in the Palm Beaches. 2026 Cognizant Classic TV scheduleRound 1 - ThursdayRound 1 starts: 6:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 6:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveLive TV coverage: 2-6 p.m. on Golf ChannelRadio: 12-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 2 - FridayRound 2 starts: 6:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 6:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveLive TV coverage: 2-6 p.m. on Golf ChannelRadio: 12-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 3 - SaturdayRound 3 starts: 7:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 7:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on PeacockLive TV coverage: 3-6 p.m. on NBCLive streaming: 3-6 p.m. on PeacockRadio: 1-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 7:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 7:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelLive TV coverage: 3-6 p.m. on NBCLive streaming: 3-6 p.m. on Peacock\nRadio: 1-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            ",

The Colts met with Richardson's agent Deiric Jackson on Thursday morning and they mutually agreed that it was best for both parties to look into all available options. If his fifth-year option is not used, the 2023 No. 4 overall pick has one season left on his rookie contract.Last year, Richardson was beat out by Daniel Jones in the preseason for the starting QB job. With the former New York Giants quarterback expected to be the starter again, Richardson's future with the Colts can best be described as uncertain.Richardson's career has been defined by injuries. The 23-year-old has been with the Colts for three seasons but has only appeared in 17 games with 15 starts.In his first year with the team, Richardson played just four games, going 2-2 with 577 yards, three touchdowns, one interception, 136 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground. An injury to his throwing shoulder ended his rookie season prematurely.\nHe's also dealt with hip, back and foot injuries that caused him to miss a total of three games in 2024.Last October, during warmups ahead of their Week 6 game, Richardson sustained an orbital fracture that required surgery after a freak accident with a stretching band. The injury caused him to miss 12 games last season, but according to ESPN, doctors \"indicate his vision has been restored.\"This week, Colts general manager Chris Ballard said Richardson has been cleared to play football. \nRichardson certainly still has a lot of his career left and could get a fresh start with a new team. Recently the NFL has seen numerous quarterbacks struggle with one team and find a resurgence later in their career. The most recently display of this is Super Bowl champion Sam Darnold, who bounced around the league, playing for four teams before finding the ultimate success with the Seattle Seahawks.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Free-agent starting pitcher Max Scherzer is headed back to the Blue Jays on an incentive-laden $3 million contract, per Sportsnet. He joins a talented stable of starting pitchers, though one with plenty of question marks. Kevin Gausman and Dylan Cease stand at the top, rookie Trey Yesavage and inconsistent José Berríos are also in the mix, as are Scherzer and Cody Ponce, who is returning to MLB from Korea. Shane Bieber is dealing with forearm fatigue and will get a late start to the season. The Blue Jays, of course, are looking to get back to the World Series after falling just short of a title last year.Much more interesting when it comes to Scherzer, though, is his career as a whole. He'll be 41 years old this season and has battled injuries the last several years, going back to his injury during the 2019 World Series. That is to say that this might well be his swan song. What a career it has been. If you're curious about whether or not he's going to be a Hall of Famer, I can just let you know right now that he is absolutely going to make it. In parts of 18 seasons, Scherzer is 221-117, having led his league in wins four times. He has a 3.22 ERA (131 ERA+) and 1.08 WHIP -- he led his league in WHIP five times. \nWhen it comes to the counting stats, Scherzer is likely to hit two milestones this season. He's already topped 3,000 strikeouts and that's well in the rearview, but he's only 11 from 3,500, having already recorded 3,489 in his career. It means much less to the baseball world than 3,000, but only 10 pitchers have ever reached 3,500 strikeouts and the top 10 is within reach; Walter Johnson is 10th all-time with 3,509. In fact, it seems possible that Scherzer could climb as high as seventh on the all-time list this season. 6. Tom Seaver, 3,640 strikeouts7. Don Sutton, 3,5748. Justin Verlander, 3,5539. Gaylord Perry, 3,53410. Walter Johnson, 3,50911. Max Scherzer, 3,489Verlander is a moving target there, as he's signed with the Tigers for 2026. Scherzer had 82 strikeouts in 17 starts last season, so finishing around Sutton is a reasonable prediction, though it's likely Verlander stays ahead. That means, in this case, Scherzer would finish the season in eighth place all-time. \nFurther, Scherzer has 2,963 innings pitched. The 3,000-inning mark isn't quite as ballyhooed as racking up the strikeouts, but Scherzer is likely to become the 139th pitcher ever to hit 3,000 innings. Keep in mind it's a much different game than back in the 1800s and early 1900s. If we limited the scope to just pitchers in the Wild Card Era (1995-present), Scherzer would then become just the 12th pitcher to reach 3,000 innings. The most recent pitchers to get there were Verlander, Zack Greinke and CC Sabathia. Something that isn't required but is always a nice bonus to have here is what I like to call the Feel Factor. Meaning, when you were watching a player during his career, did it feel like you were watching a Hall of Famer? It's just a gut-feel thing and we should be able to answer immediately. With Scherzer, it's one of those easy, slam-dunk, emphatic \"yes\" answers. Think about watching prime Scherzer just stomp around the mound out there, controlling the entire game. He's long had that feel. In terms of awards, Scherzer is one of just 11 pitchers to have won three Cy Youngs. He also finished second once, third twice and fifth twice, giving him seven top-five finishes. He's an eight-time All-Star with two World Series rings. Speaking of, in his postseason career, he has a 3.78 ERA with 182 strikeouts in 157 ⅓ innings. \nBy JAWS, Scherzer is already above the average Hall of Fame starting pitcher at 27th all-time (there are 67 Hall of Fame starters). He's ahead of Nolan Ryan and Roy Halladay, just to name two studs in the same ballpark, and right on the heels of Tom Glavine, Greinke and Fergie Jenkins. What more is there for Scherzer to accomplish? Not much, really. We've already discussed the strikeout and innings milestones within reach, but those are minor. Scherzer's Hall of Fame resume is already overwhelming and complete. He has plenty of money too. He's pitching now for the love of the game and that's pretty admirable in and of itself.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets are trading edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II to the Tennessee Titans in exchange for nose tackle T'Vondre Sweat, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirms. The trade cannot be processed until March, when the new league year begins. Johnson is a former first-round pick, selected by the Jets with the No. 26 overall pick in 2022 under Robert Saleh. He reunites with Saleh, whom the Titans hired to replace Brian Callahan as coach. The Jets dealt away other first-rounders recently, also shipping off cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys at the trade deadline. Johnson played in 14 games for New York last season, starting 13, and finished with 43 combined tackles, including 22 solo tackles, six quarterback hits and 3.0 sacks. In 47 games across four seasons, the 27-year-old has 131 tackles, 27 quarterback hits and 13 sacks. His best season came in 2023, when his career-best 7.5 sacks helped earn him Pro Bowl honors.  Sweat was a 2024 second-round pick of the Titans, recording 85 tackles and three sacks throughout his first two seasons. The Jets had a need to fill when it came to their run defense, as they allowed the fourth-most rushing yards last year (2,371).\nThe Jets have the No. 2 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft while the Titans hold the fourth selection.Here are Zach Pereles' trade grades:Jets: B+Sweat is a big, big man -- 6-4 and 366 pounds -- but he's more than just heft in the middle. Pro Football Focus rated him as the fifth-best interior defensive lineman in the NFL and the fourth-best against the run in 2025. Though he's not as much of a pass rusher as his now-former fellow Titans interior defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, he's not a complete zero there, either: He had a 9.4% pressure rate, a respectable if not spectacular number. His 74.1 pass rush grade from PFF was 19th out of 112 interior defenders.Sweat isn't a full-time player. He played two-thirds of the Titans' snaps as a rookie, when he appeared in all 17 games, and only about half of their snaps last year. And that number only factors in when he was available; he missed five games due to an ankle injury. That's why landing in New York makes sense. The Jets don't have depth at many spots, but they do have it along the interior of the defensive line. Harrison Phillips is a dependable veteran, and former Browns seventh-round pick Jowon Briggs impressed after being acquired over the summer. It's a solid group for a defense that allowed 46 explosive rushes last year, tied for sixth-most in the NFL.\nMore than anything, though, the Jets get a strong grade for three reasons. First, Sweat still has two more years remaining on his rookie deal; Johnson only has one, and it's his fifth-year option. That's a win for a team in the early days of a rebuild. If Sweat plays well in 2026, he's still cheap in 2027. Second, Sweat (24) is two-and-a-half years younger than Johnson (27). It's not a massive differentiating factor, but it is worth mentioning.Third, the Jets have the No. 2 overall pick in the NFL Draft, and they can clearly set their sights on adding another EDGE defender opposite Will McDonald IV. Arvell Reese leads a strong EDGE group that also includes Rueben Bain and David Bailey. New York, which also has the No. 16 pick (as part of the Gardner trade), the No. 33 pick and the No. 44 pick (as part of the Williams trade) can build in earnest on both sides of the ball. It was a rough first year for Aaron Glenn in the Big Apple, but with a run-stuffing defensive lineman in tow and plenty of draft picks upcoming (including three first-rounders in 2027), brighter days could be ahead.Titans: B-Perhaps we should have seen this coming when, Tuesday, Saleh said, \"[Sweat's] a big man, and he has much faster feet that people realize. Is it going to be easy for him? It's not, it's a lot of work and it is physically demanding to play d-line in our system.\"\nThe Titans desperately needed pass rush help. After Simmons' 11 sacks, the team's sack leaders were Jihad Ward's (five) and Dre'Mont Jones and Jaylen Harrell's (4.5). Ward is entering free agency, and Jones was traded midseason to the Ravens.Whether Johnson can provide that pass-rushing boost is another question. Johnson's 2023 -- under Saleh -- was outstanding, but he tore his Achilles early in 2024, and he wasn't nearly the same in 2025. His 9.5% pressure rate was 110th out of 184 players who rushed the passer at least 200 times. It'd be foolish to write off a player one year after he came back from injury, but it'd also be foolish to write off the injury altogether.The fact that Johnson is going into the fifth-year option of his rookie deal and Sweat still has two more years on his rookie deal does hurt Tennessee's grade a touch.\nSaleh has changed the look of his team dramatically in the weeks since taking the job. This trade came one day after Tennessee released starting center Lloyd Cushenberry and starting safety Xavier Woods. The Titans have the most cap space in the NFL (nearly $100 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap) and the No. 4 pick, which it can still use on a pass rusher or a defensive back or an addition to Cam Ward's offense. Pairing Simmons with a disruptive edge player is a solid strategy, and if Johnson recaptures his 2023 form, it could be much more than that.\n            ",

A few free agents remain, but unlike what we've seen a few times this past decade, none of the biggest names are without a job. That means that, with free agency settled, we can now look back at last season and take stock of which teams lost the most. Remember, we're only talking about free agents, so teams trading talent away (see: Cardinals, St. Louis) doesn't count here. We're going to create different categories to run through which teams took the biggest losses and note, where applicable, how those losses were mitigated.

The problem is that signing Alex Bregman last winter started a chain reaction that led to Rafael Devers being traded away. Now Bregman has signed with the Cubs. The Red Sox head into the season with Caleb Durbin at third and Marcelo Mayer at second, flanking injury-prone shortstop Trevor Story. Unless Story avoids injury again, as he did last year in playing 157 games, while Mayer quickly grows into a quality everyday player, the Red Sox's infield looks suspect. The Sox also lost a few others, but the major needle-mover is Bregman.Lost a star, but ...\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cubs - Lost Kyle TuckerThe Cubs let Tucker, the top free agent on the market this offseason, walk, watching from the sidelines as he signed with the Dodgers. He's a big loss. He's better than Bregman. Still, this is a soft landing for the Cubs. They can move Seiya Suzuki from DH back to right field to absorb the Tucker loss while Bregman is an upgrade at third base over Matt Shaw, who moves to utility backup (which could even include some at-bats at DH). \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Blue Jays - Lost Bo BichetteBichette signed with the Mets and the Blue Jays lost a key piece to their American League pennant-winning roster. The thing is, they were without him the last few weeks of the regular season in 2025 and most of the playoffs. He was on one leg in the World Series. They showed they can hit without him. They also added third baseman Kazuma Okamoto in free agency, meaning Andrés Giménez takes Bichette's shortstop with Ernie Clement shifting to second base. The offense last season with much better with Bichette in it, but things like the addition of Okamoto along with possibly a full season of Daulton Varsho can make up for the loss.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Astros - Lost Framber ValdezA playoff fixture in the 2020s to that point, Valdez faltered in the second half last season and the Astros missed the playoffs for the first time since 2016. Their longtime ace is now with the Tigers, meaning the Astros -- whose rotation has been decimated with injuries the last few years -- lost a pitcher who averaged over 190 innings per season the last four years.The full-season return of Cristian Javier should help, but the big move here was bringing in Japanese ace Tatsuya Imai. The 27-year-old righty was 10-5 with a 1.92 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 163 ⅔ innings in NPB last year. Lost two stars, but ... \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mets - Lost Pete Alonso and Edwin DíazAfter seven years, 264 home runs and 712 RBI, the Mets' franchise home run leader, Alonso, has signed with the Orioles. He led the NL with 41 doubles last season, also contributing 38 homers and 126 RBI. He's a five-time All-Star. Díaz was more of a roller coaster in his seven years (six seasons, as he missed all of 2023 due to injury), but he was a stellar closer most of the time. He's third all time in saves for the franchise. \nThose are heavy losses and the Mets lost a few others, too. On the other hand, they also brought in Bichette and Jorge Polanco in free agency, not to mention Marcus Semien and Luis Robert via trade. On the pitching side, they traded for Freddy Peralta while signing Devin Williams and Luke Weaver from the Yankees. This was more a reshaping than a gutting. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mariners - Lost Jorge Polanco and Eugenio SuárezThe Mariners got further than ever before in 2025, reaching Game 7 of the ALCS. Polanco was their cleanup hitter in that game while Suárez hit sixth and had one of the biggest hits in Mariners history -- a grand slam -- earlier in the series. Suárez hit 49 home runs with 118 RBI overall last season. On the surface, these sound like huge losses. Remember, though, Suárez only played 53 regular-season games with the Mariners and slashed .189/.255/.428 (94 OPS+) in that time. He had big moments in the playoffs, but still hit .213 with a .275 OBP. By no means was he indispensable for the 2025 Mariners.\nPolanco was good last season too, but 2.6 WAR says he wasn't stellar or anything. The Mariners brought Josh Naylor back in free agency and he was only acquired in late July, so a full season there is a plus. They also traded for Brendon Donovan. It's a different dynamic in the lineup with the changes, but it's a possibility the moves end up a relative wash or even a win for the M's. \nLost bullpen depth \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Yankees - Lost Luke Weaver and Devin WilliamsThe bullpen ended up a problem area for the Yankees last season. They needed to move pieces around at the backend often and traded for three relievers in front of the deadline. Now Weaver and Williams have signed elsewhere. The Yankees didn't add anyone prominent from outside the organization either. Of course, that duo was part of the problem last season. Also, full seasons from David Bednar and Camilo Doval could help. Maybe a fresh start for Jake Bird ends up with him showing a little something, as opposed to the catastrophe that was his stint in the Bronx last year. How much did they really lose?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rangers They lost a small village in free agency: Adolis García, Tyler Mahle, Merrill Kelly, Phil Maton, Hoby Milner and Jonah Heim, among others. \nGarcía has been a sub-par hitter the last two years and heads to age-33 with a lot of questions. Kelly only made 10 starts last year after the deadline and wasn't even good. Mahle was very good, but only made 16 starts and hasn't been in the rotation for a full season since 2021 with the Reds. Plus, the Rangers' rotation looks loaded without him. Heim is a replaceable catcher. Maton and Milner can be quality relievers, but middle relievers are the easiest thing to find on the scrap heap on a year-to-year basis. The Rangers lost a good number of players in free agency, but I'm not sure losing any of them made the team worse. On the other hand ... Losses left holes\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    PhilliesThe loss of lefty Ranger Suárez comes at a bad time for the rotation. Aaron Nola might've hit his decline last season and Zack Wheeler is now tasked with coming back from thoracic outlet syndrome. Youngster Andrew Painter will be asked to step up once he eventually makes his MLB debut while the Phillies need Cristopher Sánchez and Jesús Luzardo to look like frontline starters. \nFurther, Harrison Bader was so valuable for the Phillies down the stretch in center field. He's signed elsewhere. Rookie Justin Crawford needs to win and hold down the job in center. García also needs to show them something in right field after his two down seasons with Texas. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    PadresWe saved the worst for last because the Padres appear to have taken the biggest losses in free agency as a team. It was big to bring back Michael King in free agency and getting Joe Musgrove back from Tommy John surgery is great, but losing Dylan Cease means the last two spots in the Padres' rotation belong to some combination of Randy Vásquez, Germán Márquez and J.P. Sears. That's not very deep.\nThe strong bullpen last season could shorten games like no one else. They've lost Robert Suarez to the Braves. It's still a stellar backend group with Mason Miller, Jason Adam and Adrian Morejon, but that's an important late-inning arm now throwing for a National League competitor. The offense lost Luis Arraez and Ryan O'Hearn. These aren't losses that cannot be overcome, but they are a decent blow to the depth. \n            ",

Under a new recommendation, players disqualified for targeting for the first time during the season will be allowed to play in their next game, regardless of which half the targeting penalty occurs. Under the current rule, a player disqualified in the second half of a game for targeting has to sit out the first half of the subsequent game. If the rule changes, any player disqualified for targeting for a second time during the season would miss the first half of their next game. A third disqualification for targeting would result in the offending player being suspended for their next game in full. \"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said rules subcommittee chair A.J. Edds in a statement. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n        \n            \n                NCAA to discuss targeting rule changes, could make penalty 'less punitive' for 2026 college football season\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe proposal also allows for a conference to initiate an appeals process following a player's second targeting violation. If the appeal is successful, then the player would be allowed to play both halves in their next game. \nThe proposal still has to pass both the FBS and FCS Oversight Committees before it is made official. Both committees are set to meet in March to consider rule proposals. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The NFL's new league year doesn't open until Wednesday, March 11 at 4 p.m. ET. That's when teams can officially sign free agents and complete trades – but trades certainly can be agreed upon at any time and one actually has been on Thursday, Feb. 26 between the Jets and Titans. One of the big stories in the NFL this week was regarding the status of Eagles Pro Bowl wideout A.J. Brown and whether he returns to the City of Brotherly Love. We have odds from DraftKings Sportsbook on his next team.Bet on the NFL at DraftKings and get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5+ wins:You likely remember during the 2022 NFL Draft when the Eagles got Brown from the Tennessee Titans in exchange for the 18th and 101st overall picks. That was an utter heist for Philly as the Titans took wideout Treylon Burks at No. 18 and he was a major bust and isn't even with the franchise anymore.Following the trade, Brown signed a four-year, $100 million extension with $57 million guaranteed. And he has been worth it with four straight seasons of at least 1,000 yards receiving, the first Eagles player to accomplish that feat. He's also had at least seven touchdown grabs in each season.Brown clearly grew unhappy last season when the Philadelphia offense struggled as a whole, and his numbers were down a bit. The Eagles finished with their lowest scoring average (22.3), yards per game (311.2) and rush yards per game (116.9) under Nick Sirianni. Thanks to its defense, Philly had six wins while finishing with less than 300 yards of offense. Those were the most such wins in that scenario since the 2007 Chicago Bears. The Eagles had three wins when scoring fewer than 20 points, their most such since 2007.Brown had zero receptions in a half seven times last season. That happened just once in 2024. He was clearly angry on the sidelines multiple times and there were a few arguments to be seen on TV with Sirianni and others as Brown openly expressed his frustration with the offensive operation. He reportedly was shopped ahead of the trade deadline, but the Eagles weren't going to just give the 28-year-old away as they still thought they were contenders to repeat as Super Bowl champions.This week, Sirianni said at the NFL Combine that he wanted Brown back next season but neither he nor general manager Howie Roseman committed to that. Roseman said the team would entertain trade offers for Brown.\"Will A.J. be here next season? I think we're still in a spot, like, I can't guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season. I'm thinking I'm going to be the coach next season, but you can't guarantee anything past tomorrow,\" Sirianni said.  The Eagles would absorb a dead cap hit of over $40 million if they dealt Brown before June 1, compared with less than $20 million if a trade is consummated after that date -- thus, we probably don't see anything happen at least before the draft. The team acquiring Brown would be responsible for his $29 million salary in 2026.Sportsbooks word these player prop futures differently. Some will phrase it as \"Which is A.J. Brown's next team if not the Eagles?\" DraftKings simply asks for Brown's team for next season and includes Philly as the -175 favorite. However, it feels like there's too much smoke there for Brown to return.A.J. Brown next team odds (via DraftKings)Eagles -175Patriots +275Chargers +700Bills +900Titans +1000Raiders +1400Ravens +160049ers +1800Dolphins +1800New England is the clear non-Eagles favorite at +275 and that makes so much sense. For one thing, you know the Eagles would like to ship Brown out of the NFC so he can't torment them in a future postseason. Secondly, the Pats badly need playmakers at wideout, which was made very evident in the blowout loss to Seattle in Super Bowl 60.  Brown began his NFL career with current Pats coach Mike Vrabel in Tennessee and they are still tight. So if Brown has a say in the matter, this marriage makes a lot of sense.Bet NFL futures at FanDuel and get $100 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5+ wins:Veteran Stefon Diggs had a solid year for the Pats and became the team's first 1,000-yard receiver since Julian Edelman in 2019, but he might be released for salary cap reasons. Diggs will see his base salary increase from $2.9 million in 2025 to $20.6 million in 2026 and 2027. His salary cap number jumps from $10.5 million last year to $26.5 million in each of the next two seasons. The 32-year-old really isn't worth that these days. On Monday when I first saw these odds, the Los Angeles Chargers weren't near the top of the board at +2000 but are now +700 as there is currently two times more handle and bets on the Bolts than the next most-wagered club. Justin Herbert has one good wideout in Ladd McConkey, but he's more of a possession guy and not the red-zone threat the 6-2, 225-pound Brown is. Los Angeles has a ton of cap space and wideout Keenan Allen is a free agent.Buffalo (+900) needs a No. 1 wideout more than New England does and obviously trading for Brown would keep him from its AFC East rivals. Since Diggs left Buffalo after the 2023 season, the Bills have not had a receiver cross the 1,000-yard mark.  Would the Eagles accept the Bills' first-round pick sitting at No. 26 overall as adequate compensation?Tennessee (+1000), Las Vegas (+1400) and Miami (+1800) seem like non-starters as all are light years from contention, so why bother giving up assets for a 28-year-old? The Dolphins have risen from +1000 since Monday.Baltimore (+1600) and San Francisco (+1800) offer contending situations. Adding Brown to Zay Flowers (88 catches, 1,211 yards, five TDs in 2025) would give the Ravens a stellar 1-2 punch at wideout around Lamar Jackson. And Brown has a relationship with Derrick Henry from their Titans days. My value pick would be Buffalo as the Bills need to capitalize on Josh Allen's window while he's still playing at an MVP level. With the beating Allen takes due to his physical running style, a major injury could happen at any time. Brandon Beane is also under quite a bit of pressure to win in 2026 after mega-successful coach Sean McDermott was fired and Beane was kept. R.J. White has already broken down 2026 NFL win totals, and Brown likely would add a half-win to certain clubs if dealt.\n            ",

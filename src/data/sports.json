    "body": "\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will host the San Francisco 49ers on NFL Wild Card Sunday, with both teams having aspirations of, again, making deep postseason runs. These two have combined for five Super Bowl trips over the last eight years, including representing the NFC in each of the last three seasons. Philly (11-6) is the No. 3 seed after claiming the NFC East, and the Eagles have won four straight playoff games under Jalen Hurts. San Fran (12-5) is the 6-seed and saw a six-game win streak end with a defeat to Seattle last Saturday. The Over is 6-3 for San Fran over its last nine games, while the Under is 7-2 over the last nine Philadelphia contests.Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The Niners won the last matchup, which came in the 2023 season. The latest 49ers vs. Eagles odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Philadelphia as a 5.5-point favorite, an increase from Philly opening as 3.5-point favorites. Meanwhile, the over/under for total points is 44.5. San Fran is 11-6 against the spread this season, while Philly is 10-7 versus the line.

Coming off a season finale loss to Seattle should also motivate San Francisco, which is 4-0 ATS following a loss this season, as well as 7-2 ATS on the road. When Sunday's game kicks off, the 49ers will have the better offense on the field as they lead the NFL in third-down offense, with additional top 10 rankings in points, total yards and redzone scoring. Brock Purdy elevates his game in the postseason, with seven total TDs versus just one interception in his playoffs career, while Christian McCaffrey is coming off the third 2,000-scrimmage yard season of his career and gets to face an Eagles defense which ranks No. 22 versus the run. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Eagles can coverHome field has certainly been an advantage for the Eagles who have won five straight postseason contests at Lincoln Financial Field, with 14 takeaways versus zero giveaways over this run. The turnover battle just happens to be San Francisco's biggest weakness, as it is -6 on the season, which is the worst turnover differential of any playoff team. The Eagles are also 6-2 ATS in home postseason games over the last decade, and the defense is playing its best at the most important point of the season. Not counting Week 18 when they rested their starters, the Eagles have allowed just 10 points per game over their last three, holding opponents to only 3.6 yards per rush and not allowing a single passing TD over this stretch. The Niners' offense, meanwhile, is one-dimensional as it ranks 30th in the league in yards per carry. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Eagles vs. 49ers   picksSportsLine's model has simulated 49ers vs. Eagles 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

Against all odds, No. 10 Miami entered the CFP as the last team in the bracket and rolled all the way to the title game, defeating three higher-seeded squads along the way. No. 1 Indiana has been the championship favorite for some time now, but that the Hoosiers will play in the final game of the season is a reality that would have been unfathomable months ago.Regardless of which team wins, history will be made on Monday, Jan. 19. Either the Hoosiers will win the first championship in program history, or the Hurricanes will be the first team to win the national championship game on their home field. In fact, Miami is set to become the first program to even play a title game in its home stadium during the BCS and CFP eras.That's right -- the 2026 CFP National Championship will unfold at Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the Hurricanes. It is the second playoff game to be held in Miami Gardens this postseason after the Orange Bowl hosted No. 5 Oregon and No. 4 Texas Tech in the quarterfinal round.\nMiami is 7-1 at home this season. Two of those wins came against teams ranked at the time of the game. Indiana is the best team the Hurricanes will have faced all year, though, and considering how well Hoosiers fans traveled for the Peach Bowl, Miami may not have a true home-field advantage.It will take more than just a raucous crowd to defeat Curt Cignetti's machine of an Indiana team. The No. 1 seed is one win away from the first 16-0 record in modern college football history, and after it defeated its first two CFP opponents by a combined score of 94-25, it appears as unstoppable as ever. Not only is the defense a top-four unit in both points and yards allowed, but with Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza leading the offense, the Hoosiers are elite on both sides of the ball.\nCFP National Championship location, date, timeDate: Monday, Jan. 19 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In his final appearance on \"The NFL Today,\" outgoing CBS Sports NFL analyst and former quarterback Matt Ryan spoke about his desire to reshape the Atlanta Falcons into a contender after accepting the franchise's new position of president of football.Atlanta hasn't made the playoffs since the 2017 season -- when Ryan was still quarterbacking. The Falcons say that Ryan will \"oversee all aspects of football for the organization,\" and that both the head coach and general manager, when hired, will report to him.\"You want to be in the mix, in the playoffs, and it's been too long there,\" Ryan said on Sunday's show. \"We're going to work really hard and find the right people to get us back into that position to be successful. You guys know it, football is about the people. The building is about the people, there's a lot of really good people in that building that are already there. It starts at the top with Arthur Blank and I'm fortunate to be in this position, excited about the opportunity and ready to get started.\"\nThe former NFL MVP served as a game analyst for one season with CBS Sports before transitioning to the studio on \"The NFL Today\" for the last two years. It's nearly impossible to decline a \"President of Football\" gig, but at the same time it wasn't easy for Ryan to walk away from his current role.\nRyan said that when he retired following the 2023 season there was a void that was created by leaving the game and no longer having teammates or that sense of belonging. Ryan spoke from the heart about the difficulty that can take place in filling that space, but Ryan expressed gratitude for having a new set of teammates at the network over the last three years. \"When I left [the Falcons] I was so lucky to be given the opportunity by [CBS Sports president] David Berson and by CBS to become a part of this team.\"\nRyan played 15 NFL seasons, 14 with the Falcons and one with the Indianapolis Colts. He is the Falcons' all-time leader in passing yards (59,735), passing touchdowns (367) and games won (120). Ryan made four Pro Bowls, and was named NFL MVP in 2016 after throwing for 4,944 yards, 38 touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\"Throughout his remarkable 14-year career in Atlanta, Matt's leadership, attention to detail, knowledge of the game and unrelenting drive to win made him the most successful player in our franchise's history,\" team owner Arthur Blank said in a statement. \"I am confident those same qualities will be a tremendous benefit to our organization as he steps into this new role. From his playing days to his time as an analyst at CBS, Matt has always been a student of the game, and he brings an astute understanding of today's NFL, as well as unique knowledge of our organization and this market. I have full confidence and trust in Matt as we strive to deliver a championship caliber team for Atlanta and Falcons fans everywhere.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Wild Card round of the NFL Playoffs are underway. By Monday morning, three-quarters of the first round draft order will be known. It is just one of two anticipated draft-related developments this week. Wednesday, Jan. 14 is the deadline for underclassmen not participating in the College Football Playoffs to declare for the 2026 NFL Draft. One of the biggest remaining questions is whether or not Oregon quarterback Dante Moore will declare.  The pieces are starting to come together and the 2026 NFL Draft is only a little more than three months away. Collegiate All-Star games will also begin late later this month. Invitations are going out to NFL Combine participants, but an official list will not be revealed until mid-February.     As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. \nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon):1. Las Vegas Raiders (3-14)Las Vegas over-extended last offseason by drafting a running back in the top-10 and trading for a 35-year-old quarterback despite having one of the league's worst rosters. As a result, they fired head coach Pete Carroll after one season and are now picking even earlier in the draft. 2. New York Jets (3-14)The Jets finished with one of the worst records in the league, but at least they have a plan and put themselves in a position to change the course of their franchise. Over the next two years, New York has five first-round picks. 3. Arizona Cardinals (3-14)Arizona made the decision to part with head coach Jonathan Gannon. It would not be a surprise if they moved on from Kyler Murray as well. The problem is that there are not a wealth of options to replace Murray.\n4. Tennessee Titans (3-14)The positive momentum Tennessee had built over the past month came to a frustrating end in the season finale. Still, Cam Ward's strong finish to the 2025 campaign should give Titans fans hope.5. New York Giants (4-13)There are reasons to be optimistic about Jaxson Dart's future with the franchise. He brought life to an offense that could have easily wallowed in self-pity following the Malik Nabers and Andrew Thomas injuries. If they get the head coach hire right, then maybe the a bounce back will happen sooner than most would expect.   6. Cleveland Browns (5-12)The Browns made the decision to part with head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons. He did lead the franchise to its first playoff win post-expansion, but may not be any closer to identifying the quarterback of the future. \n7. Washington Commanders (5-12)Next season is an easy sell for Washington. If Jayden Daniels returns healthy, then they will be competitive once again, but there are a lot of needs on that roster. An attempt to microwave those weaknesses last offseason did not work out. 8. New Orleans Saints (6-11)The Saints' season ended just as fans were clamoring for more of Tyler Shough. He looks like the clear favorite to open next season as the starting quarterback, bringing a level of optimism that simply didn't exist earlier in the year.9. Kansas City Chiefs (6-11)Kansas City will enter next season in unfamiliar territory: the hungry underdog. Assuming Patrick Mahomes' full health, there is no reason to believe the Chiefs will not be in the mix again next season. They do have a deteriorating roster that desperately needs a youthful infusion. \n10. Cincinnati Bengals (6-11)Joe Burrow made a notable attempt to get the Bengals into the playoffs after succumbing to an injury early in the season, but ultimately fell short. The offense will be in a spot to compete next season, but can the defense improve enough this offseason to get them enough stops?\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top picks; Ty Simpson to Super Bowl contender\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n11. Miami Dolphins (7-10)Fans can say what they want about the Mike McDaniel era in Miami, but few had such a recognizable aesthetic as the Dolphins' former coach. It is a fresh start for the organization with a new general manager, new head coach and presumably a new quarterback.12. Dallas Cowboys (7-9-1)Dallas is once again searching for answers this offseason. Dak Prescott was healthy and the team still failed to reach the playoffs with a new head coach. \n13. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (8-9)Atlanta fired Raheem Morris as head coach for a second time. They sent their first round pick to Los Angeles as part of the trade up for James Pearce Jr. 14. Baltimore Ravens (8-9)For the first time since 2007, the Ravens will have a new head coach after firing John Harbaugh. It sounds as though the franchise chose Lamar Jackson -- who turned 29-years-old one day after Harbaugh's firing -- over the veteran coach. 15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9)Other organizations have been quick to make a head coaching change, but the Buccaneers are going down the path of firing coordinators rather than a change at the top. \n16. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-9)Cornerback Sauce Gardner struggled to stay healthy and the Colts' pick being sent to New York rose precipitously by the week. 17. Detroit Lions (9-8)The coaching drain that took place after last season's run was likely understated in the moment given the presence Dan Campbell has over that organization, but that, along with a few veteran offensive line departures, led to a much more tumultuous season.18. Minnesota Vikings (9-8)J.J. McCarthy's season was volatile, which was once the expectation for a young quarterback. Recent rookie performances from Jayden Daniels and C.J. Stroud set unrealistic expectations for the majority. Caleb Williams is proof that situation matters. \n19. Carolina Panthers (8-9)The team with the worst record in the NFL Playoffs, but also a home game, was the first punted from the postseason. Although not a desirable conclusion, the Panthers have to be pleased with how the season played out. 20. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-7-1)The team with the second worst record in the NFL Playoffs was also dispatched after building a 21-3 lead over the division rival Bears. It is going to be an interesting offseason for the Packers. 21. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7)The Steelers needed a Week 18 victory over the rival Ravens to get into the dance, but will have an opportunity to keep their season alive against Houston. \n22. Los Angeles Chargers (11-6)The Chargers duel with the Patriots Sunday in the Wild Card Round.23. Philadelphia Eagles (11-6)In a  rematch of the NFC Championship game from two years ago, the Eagles host the 49ers in the Wild Card round.24. Buffalo Bills (12-5)Buffalo enters the Wild Card round against the Jaguars as the road team. There is always a chance at victory when Josh Allen is on the field.25. Chicago Bears (11-6)Chicago came back from an 18-point deficit to beat the rival Packers for the second time this season. Ben Johnson advances to the divisional round in his first season as head coach. \n26. San Francisco 49ers (12-5)San Francisco has an opportunity to enact revenge Sunday against the Eagles. 27. Houston Texans (12-5)Houston is one of the hottest teams in the NFL entering the postseason. They will put their 9-game win streak to the test against the Steelers. 28. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4)The Jaguars have been playing as well as anyone in the NFL over the past two months. The Browns watch anxiously to learn where their pick from the Jaguars falls. 29. Los Angeles Rams (12-5)The Rams took care of business on the road against the Panthers in the Wild Card round. 30. New England Patriots (14-3)The Patriots and Chargers have the late night game Sunday in the Wild Card round.31. Denver Broncos (14-3)The Broncos earned the No. 1 seed in the AFC West and a first-round bye with a victory over the Trey Lance-led Chargers in Week 18.32. Seattle Seahawks (14-3)Seattle clinched the NFC West crown and the top seed last week.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23–25 in Pittsburgh.

The South Bend Tribune published a story Sunday detailing a police report from New Prairie High School's wrestling coach stemming from an incident that occurred on Jan. 3, at Mishawaka High School.New Prairie high school wrestling assistant coach, Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of assault in a police report after both were in attendance at the Al Smith Wrestling Invitational. Notre Dame released a statement Sunday saying Freeman had no physical contact with Fleeger.Mishawaka police investigated the accusation and reportedly submitted their report to the prosecutor's office. It is unknown if charges have been filed from the incident.\"Vinny Freeman, head coach Marcus Freeman's son, was verbally accosted during and after his wrestling match by a local wrestling coach,\" the statement reads. \"Marcus and Joanna Freeman intervened and removed Vinny from the station. At no point did coach Freeman physically engage with anyone. We believe the police report, which includes video evidence, fully exonerates coach Freeman and makes clear these accusations are totally unfounded.\"\nThe altercation between Freeman and Fleeger allegedly happened after Vinny Freeman lost a match. The South Bend Tribune reports that police did not reveal the extent of the alleged contact between Freeman and Fleeger, who exchanged words in a hallway.This report comes on the heels of Freeman vowing to \"run it back\" with Notre Dame in late December amid interest from various NFL franchises. Notre Dame's fifth-year coach agreed to a restructured contract that puts him in the \"top tier\" of compensation among college coaches after turning down interest from two NFL franchises, according to Sports Illustrated reports. \nFreeman signed a lucrative extension ahead of last season's playoff appearance.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Forward Josh Sargent is nearing a transfer to MLS' Toronto FC after a four-and-a-half-year spell in England with Norwich City in a move that could be notable as the race to crack the U.S. men's national team's World Cup squad enters its final months, according to reports.Toronto sent a bid worth $18 million to Norwich for Sargent's services, per Fabrizio Romano, with negotiations currently underway for a transfer. Sargent missed the Canaries' 5-1 win against Walsall in the FA Cup on Sunday in a decision of his own making – manager Philippe Clement said post-match that Sargent texted him on Saturday evening to rule himself out of the match as the transfer process gets underway.\"Josh sent me a message [on Saturday] evening saying he would not be available because of transfer things in his head,\" Clement said. \"This is obviously not something we want, and will have consequences. It is something we need to speak about inside the club, but the club has made it really clear to Josh and his agent that he will not be leaving during this transfer window.\"Sargent was previously the subject of a move to Wolfsburg over the summer but the 25-year-old went on to turn the German club down, per The Athletic.The American has been a meaningful member of Norwich's attack since joining from Werder Bremen ahead of the 2021-22 season, currently boasting 56 goals in 156 appearances across all competitions for the club. He scored four goals in his debut season for the club, during which they were relegated from the Premier League, but has since scored double-digit goals in each season for Canaries. He currently has eight goals this campaign and is the team's second-leading goalscorer in the Championship, where they are currently in the midst of a relegation battle and sit one point out of safety.\nSargent's World Cup chancesFor many of the last several years, Sargent has been a fixture for the USMNT but he has battled some long-term ankle injuries during that time that have limited his availability. Coupled with fitness issues, though, Sargent's national team tenure is starting to become defined by a dry spell – he has not scored for the USMNT since 2019, a stretch that includes a goalless run at the 2022 World Cup where he played in each of the team's group stage matches.He has had his opportunities to impress head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who took charge of his first match in Oct. 2024, but has seen his chances come and go. Sargent started twice for the USMNT since Pochettino took the helm,  a period in which he has taken just three shots in total and has not managed more than 19 touches in a match. The head coach also left Sargent off the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup squad in what he described as a sporting decision, instead calling up lesser-experienced players like Patrick Agyemang, Paxten Aaronson, Damion Downs and Brian White as he explored the wider player pool.Where Sargent fits into the picture as the World Cup approaches is unclear. Pochettino seems to have settled on Folarin Balogun, Haji Wright and Ricardo Pepi as his preferred forwards and there may be room for more players but Sargent could have an opening. Pepi broke his arm in PSV's 5-1 win over Excelsior on Saturday and will spend two months on the sidelines, which could create an opening for Sargent to at least crack the U.S. roster in March for friendlies against Portugal and Belgium, for which Pepi might be unavailable.\nSargent will not be disadvantaged by a move to MLS, a league he will be playing in for the first time, since Pochettino has frequently pulled from the North American division's pool of talent. If Pepi is unavailable for the USMNT, though, that opening is not only Sargent's to take – Agyemang has emerged as a contender after making his national team debut at the start of 2025 and though he is not the highest up the depth chart, he has taken advantage of his opportunities with the national team in a way Sargent has not.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cubs and Alex Bregman have agreed to a five-year, $175 million deal. Still, three of the top four free agents and seven of the top 14 remain unsigned, meaning there's plenty of work for the Major League Baseball offseason. Given that we're staring down the middle of January, that's a bit late. Let's hit up that rumor mill on this fine Sunday, right? Yankees, Bellinger at impasseAny contract negotiations between the Yankees and All-Star outfielder Cody Bellinger are \"at an impasse,\" reports ESPN. Perhaps more importantly, the Yankees, who were previously of the mindset that Bellinger was attainable, are now reportedly  looking toward 2026 under the belief that they won't have Bellinger. The Yankees have reportedly offered Bellinger a five-year deal worth at least $150 million. He is still searching for longer terms.In 152 games for the Yankees last season, Bellinger hit .272/.334/.480 (125 OPS+) with 29 homers, 98 RBI and 5.1 WAR. \nRed Sox turn focus to BichetteThrough much of the offseason, we've heard that the top priority for the Red Sox was retaining Bregman. Now that he's signed elsewhere, the spotlight shines on the Red Sox. The Athletic points out that the five-year deal he took with the Cubs \"ffurther highlighted the club's aversion to long-term deals for players over the age of 30.\" Someone who is under 30? Bo Bichette. The 27-year-old infielder is \"likely to be their primary target,\" in the wake of Bregman signing elsewhere, per The Athletic. Ditto from the Boston Globe, which says, again, Bichette is likely to be their primary target. It's safe to say we'll see plenty of Bichette/Red Sox rumors in the next few days. They won't be alone, though, as Bregman is off the board and the Diamondbacks are no longer expected to trade Ketel Marte. There is now one All Star-caliber infielder available on the free-agent market and it's Bichette.\nIn 139 regular-season games last year, Bichette hit .311/.357/.483 (129 OPS+) with 44 doubles, 18 homers, 94 RBI and 3.5 WAR.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 season may not be Aaron Rodgers' last dance, after all. While Rodgers has previously alluded to this likely being the last season of his career, NFL Media has reported that Rodgers is open to possibly returning to Pittsburgh for the 2026 season. If Rodgers does decide to continue playing, the Steelers would welcome him back, per the report. Rodgers, 42, has had a largely successful first season with the Steelers, who will host the Houston Texans in Monday night in the weekend's final wild card game. Rodgers went 10-6 as Pittsburgh's starter this season while helping the Steelers capture their first AFC North division title since 2020. Monday night will mark the Steelers' first home playoff game since that 2020 season. \nRodgers' reportedly being open to another season in Pittsburgh shouldn't come as a surprise. He has been open about how much he has enjoyed this past season after enduring two turbulent seasons with the New York Jets. Rodgers has specifically been vocal about how much he has enjoyed playing for Mike Tomlin, who played an integral role in Rodgers coming to Pittsburgh last season when retirement was on the table. \"I've enjoyed my time with Mike immensely,\" Rodgers said last week. \"Mike is a phenomenal leader. He's great in front of the room. We have our meetings on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings with quarterbacks that are really, really helpful. Seeing his perspective on the plan, on the opponent, every single week. So, it's been a great experience. I really appreciate Mike. And yeah, I'm just thankful that he was a part of bringing me here.\"\nIf Rodgers comes back, the Steelers are set up to build a stronger roster around him. The Steelers are slated to have as many as 12 picks in the upcoming NFL Draft, which will be held in Pittsburgh for the first time. Pittsburgh is expected to focus on strengthening its receiving corps and could possibly use a high draft pick to select one. USC's Makai Lemon and Ohio State's Carnell Tate are two possible options if the Steelers chose to use a first-round pick on a receiver. Regardless of what Rodgers does, don't be surprised if the Steelers make upgrades at quarterback, too. While the team appears to like rookie Will Howard's upside, Pittsburgh may be compelled to use some of its draft picks in order to move up to select one of the draft's top-ranked quarterback prospects that includes Oregon's Dante Moore, Alabama's Ty Simpson and Indiana's Fernando Mendoza. For now, though, Rodgers and the Steelers' primary focus is on Monday night's game against a Texans team that finished the regular season with nine straight wins. Houston's success has been largely due to a defense that allowed the second-fewest points in the NFL during the regular season. \"It feels good to be back,\" Rodgers said about being back in the playoffs for the first time since 2021. \"That's why you play. You want to be playing meaningful football late in the season. And we put ourselves in that position. \n\"I think some of it's embracing the way the season has gone. At 6-6, there are a lot of people thinking we were going to be kind of stumbling to the finish, and then who knows what was going to happen? A lot of you probably in this group, either publicly or privately, we're talking about Mike T getting axed. So, it feels good to shut all those comments down. Clean the slate. Now, anybody can make a run. You know, it's the hottest team. We've won four out of five. We're playing a lot better football than we were earlier in the season. I like our chances.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While there are plenty of on-field/on-court/on-ice moments carrying us through this particular weekend, Major League Baseball finally saw a big splash as well: the Cubs have agreed with three-time All-Star third baseman Alex Bregman on a five-year, $175 million deal.Let's examine the fallout.The Cubs fitEven in losing free-agent right fielder Kyle Tucker to free agency, there was an argument that the Cubs were perfectly fine running it back with their position players. Carson Kelly and Miguel Amaya can split catching duties. Michael Busch, Nico Hoerner, Dansby Swanson and Matt Shaw filled out the infield. Ian Happ, Pete Crow-Armstrong and Seiya Suzuki are set in the outfield and Moisés Ballesteros seems ready to take on everyday DH work. Still, I recently noted that the offense could sure use at least one upgrade to help take the Cubs to the proverbial next level.Bregman replacing Shaw in the lineup, at least in theory and on paper, makes that happen.\nYes, Shaw was a better hitter in the second half, but .258/.317/.522 in a 63-game sample isn't enough to take a player like Bregman off the table. Further, Shaw hit .222/.313/.375 in the last month of the season and .118/.318/.118 in the playoffs. Even if you believe in Shaw down the line, Bregman is an upgrade in the short term for a playoff team.Cubs trade bait?First things first, let's be clear: The Cubs don't have to trade anyone. If they decide they want to strengthen the organization elsewhere by dealing from the infield crowd, though, it's possible. There have been rumors for weeks that Hoerner could be moved. Personally, I think that would be an outrageously stupid move, given that I believe he's one of the best \"glue guys\" in baseball. But, sure, we'll humor the rumor mill and point out that the Cubs could move him in his last year before free agency and put Shaw at second.\nMore likely is Shaw being dealt. There's plenty of potential: he posted 3.1 WAR as a rookie at age 24 and he can play both second and third -- and even shortstop, in a bind. If the Cubs truly believed he was ready for a star turn, they wouldn't have signed Bregman to a five-year deal. Then again, Hoerner is only one year away from free agency, so keeping Shaw around provides a backup plan for 2027.As noted, the Cubs don't have to make a trade. If they do, either Hoerner or Shaw could go. No Marte? For much of the offseason, Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte has been rumored to be on the trading block. Instead, the D-backs have decided to hold onto their All-Star infielder. \nThis might seem odd to mention here but these are all pieces of the glorious tapestry that is the MLB offseason right now. Plenty of contending teams could use an infield upgrade and with Bregman and, seemingly, Marte off the table, other pieces now become more in demand. Speaking of which ...Bichette front and centerBo Bichette is coming off a season in which he hit .311 with a 129 OPS+ and was a beast in the World Series. He's a shortstop, but can also handle second base and, conceivably, could play third if a team asked him to. With Bregman off the board and Marte no longer a viable trade candidate, Bichette is the top infield option and it's not particularly close. There's already a lot of smoke with the Red Sox and Bichette and we'll hear more about a handful more suitors in the coming days. Donovan could followIt's always domino effect with these things, right? Let's suppose that Marte is really off the market and the Cubs are going to hold onto Hoerner. Even if Shaw is available, Cardinals All-Star utility man Brendan Donovan is better, meaning he's in line behind Bichette for contenders seeking an infield upgrade. \nDonovan, who turns 29 in a few days, is under team control through 2027. He hit .287/.353/.422 (119 OPS+) with 2.7 WAR last season. He recently agreed to a $5.8 million contract for 2026 ahead of the arbitration deadline.The hunch here is the Donovan rumor mill won't really start churning until Bichette signs, but with Bregman and Marte off the market, that could be soon.It's all related. And it's all pretty fun right now here in the middle of January for all things MLB rumors.\n            ",

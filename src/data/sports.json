The Over has hit in seven of the last 10 Coastal Carolina games, including one push. The Over is 4-2 in the last six Louisiana Tech games. Coastal Carolina quarterback Samari Collier's status is uncertain after an injury late in the season, and the model has quarterback Tad Hudson, who could start if Collier doesn't play, passing for more than 195 yards passing and two touchdowns, while Louisiana Tech running back Omiri Wiggins will rush for nearly 80 yards and one touchdown. The teams are projected to combine for 57 points as the Over clears in nearly 60% of simulations. The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 70% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Louisiana Tech vs. Coastal Carolina, and which side of the spread hits in nearly 70% of simulations? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Coastal Carolina vs. Louisiana Tech spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Assists were the theme of Week 17 in the NFL. Various outcomes throughout the slate had ramifications that stretched beyond the two teams going toe to toe and have begun reshaping the playoff picture in both conferences.On Christmas Day, the Vikings punched the Packers' ticket to the playoffs after defeating the Lions. On Saturday, the Texans not only clinched a playoff berth, but handed the AFC West title to the Broncos after defeating the Chargers. As we continued through Sunday's action, even more assists were dished out, most notably with the Seahawks and Browns pulling off wins against the Panthers and Steelers, respectively.Because of those outcomes (along with Miami defeating Tampa Bay), we could have two win-or-go-home division title matchups in Week 18: Ravens at Steelers for the AFC North and Panthers at Buccaneers for the NFC South. However, this NFC South matchup could have a wrench thrown into it depending on how the Falcons end their season. While out of the playoff race, if Atlanta wins out (vs. the Rams on Monday night and Saints), Carolina will win the division, regardless of the outcome of that matchup with the Bucs. That's due to the Panthers winning a tiebreaker because of a better head-to-head record among the three teams. In the late window on Sunday, the Eagles lent a helping hand to the Patriots, securing the AFC East crown for New England after Philly took down the Bills in Buffalo. \nAs for Sunday's prime-time slugfest between the 49ers and Bears, San Francisco's victory now sets up a Week 18 showdown between them and the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed and NFC West title. And to finish up Week 17, the Falcons jumped out to a 21-0 lead over the Rams and held on for the 27-24 victory on \"Monday Night Football.\"As we wrap up the bulk of Sunday's action, here's a look at the current playoff picture. \nAFC standingsz-Denver Broncos (13-3)z-New England Patriots (13-3)x-Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)x-Houston Texans (11-5)x-Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)x-Buffalo Bills (11-5)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. ChargersDenver got back to its winning ways with a key victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. With the win, the Broncos remain the No. 1 seed in the conference and are now the AFC West division winners after the Texans beat the Chargers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had already clinched a playoff berth in Week 16, and are now AFC East champions thanks to the events of Week 17. They did their part earlier on Sunday by blowing out the Jets, and then the Eagles fended off the Bills to lock up the division. New England is also still alive for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Remaining schedule: vs. TitansThe Jaguars fended off the Colts in Week 17 and can clinch the AFC South next week with a win over the Titans.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)Remaining schedule: vs. RavensAfter falling to the Browns in Week 17, the Steelers face a do-or-die matchup with the Ravens in Week 18. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Houston Texans (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have won eight straight games to punch their ticket to the playoffs. Houston extended that winning streak with a victory over the Chargers on the road and remains alive in the AFC South race. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)Remaining schedule: at BroncosThe Chargers had their four-game winning streak snapped with a Saturday afternoon loss against the Texans. They are likely to rest players in Week 18 and prepare for a road opener. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. JetsThe Bills' defeat at the hands of the Eagles in Week 17 officially eliminated them from winning the AFC East and has dropped them to the No. 7 seed. The Bills have already clinched a playoff berth, so it'll be interesting to see if they opt for rest over seed positioning in Week 18. In the huntThe Ravens (8-8), with Lamar Jackson sidelined, kept their playoff hopes alive with an impressive road win against the Packers in Green Bay. Then, on Sunday, they had their prayers answered with the Browns upsetting Pittsburgh. That sets up a winner-take-all matchup in the AFC North against the Steelers in Week 18. The loser will be eliminated from playoff contention. NFC standingsx-Seattle Seahawks (13-3)z-Chicago Bears (11-5)z-Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Carolina Panthers (8-8)x-San Francisco 49ers (12-4)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-5)x-Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (13-3)Remaining schedule: at 49ersSeattle pulled off an incredible, come-from-behind win over the Rams on \"Thursday Night Football,\" elevating itself to the No. 1 seed in the conference in the process. They continued to hold that top spot in the conference after taking down the Panthers in Week 17. So long as they take down the 49ers in Week 18, they'll win the NFC West and be the No. 1 seed. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. LionsThe Bears nearly pulled off yet another comeback against the 49ers, but came up just short. Even with the loss in Week 17, Chicago currently sits as the No. 2 seed in the conference thanks to the head-to-head tiebreaker they own over Philly. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. CommandersPhiladelphia punched its playoff ticket in Week 16 with a commanding victory over the Commanders. The defending Super Bowl champions became the first team to win back-to-back NFC East crowns since 2004. After outlasting the Bills in Week 17, the Eagles are merely fighting for seeding in the regular-season finale\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Carolina Panthers (8-8)Remaining schedule: at BuccaneersDespite losing to the Seahawks, Carolina still has two paths to winning the NFC South entering Week 18.\nThe first is simple: Beat the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay on Saturday night.Even if that doesn't happen, the Panthers can still clinch the division if the Falcons defeat the Saints on Sunday. That outcome would create a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9, a scenario in which Carolina would hold the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. San Francisco 49ers (12-4)Remaining schedule: vs. SeahawksThe 49ers have a playoff berth already clinched, and after staving off the Bears in Week 17, are heading into a Week 18 matchup against the Seahawks that'll determine the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the NFC. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Rams (11-5)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are in the playoffs, but cannot climb to the No. 1 seed or win the NFC West. They'll be a wild card entry. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)Remaining schedule: at VikingsGreen Bay, minus Jordan Love, fell to Derrick Henry and the Ravens on Saturday night. The loss ended any hopes of winning the NFC North title and locked Green Bay into the NFC's No. 7 seed.In the huntThe Buccaneers (7-9) have experienced a dramatic fall from grace in this second half of the season. Even after losing to the Dolphins in Week 17, however, they still have an opportunity to jump up to the No. 4 seed as the NFC South champion. To do that, the Bucs need to win their Week 18 contest against the Panthers and have the Falcons lose to the Saints. \n            ",

Yet somehow the 49ers found a way to beat the Bears in a heavyweight battle of two of the NFC's best teams. San Francisco won 42-38 behind the play of the offense and Brock Purdy, who is playing his way into making it the 49ers' Super Six rather than Fab 5.The victory has the 49ers one game away from the top seed in the NFC. If they beat the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday night, they lock up the top seed. If they win, they could have two playoff games at home and then play the Super Bowl in their home stadium.\nWithout their stars, that is simply amazing.It's truly been Kyle Shanahan's best coaching job -- and that's saying something considering he almost won a Super Bowl with Jimmy Garoppolo.\n        \n            \n                49ers streaking into the playoffs: Why Kyle Shanahan, San Francisco look primed to break Super Bowl drought\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 12-4 49ers have been without star defensive end Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner for most of the season. Star tight end George Kittle has missed time this season and didn't play Sunday.That left it up to Shanahan to call his usual brilliant game, Purdy to continue to show he's much more than just a game manager like some say, and McCaffrey to do his thing. In the end, they rolled on offense and held on for dear life on defense. \nThe 49ers offense could not be stopped. The problem is the defense couldn't stop the Bears, which could be their undoing come playoff time. They just don't rush the passer well enough. For now, though, they are up to No. 5 in my Power Rankings with a chance to move up even higher by beating the Seahawks Saturday. If that happens, it's truly an all-time great coaching job by Shanahan. It might be what propels him to his first Coach of the Year award. Let's not forget that Purdy also missed eight games due to injury.There are a lot of viable candidates to win the Coach  of the Year award -- Mike Vrabel, Liam Coen, Ben Johnson -- but if this version of the 49ers ends up as the top seed in the NFC, Shanahan has to be the guy.\nIf they end up in the Super Bowl, it will be simply amazing. I don't know if the defense is good enough, but the offense will be fun to watch as they make their way through the postseason -- and that's because of Shanahan.Stars matter, but so far, somehow, the 49ers have made do without most of theirs.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                3\n            \n                Dolphins\n            \n                6\n            \n                Colts\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Seahawks\n                                \n                            They need to beat the 49ers on the road Saturday to be the top seed in the conference.

    "body": "\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders finally get back on the field Thursday when they face the Oregon Ducks in a College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup in the Orange Bowl. The Red Raiders (12-1) are the No. 4 seed but have not played a game since the Big 12 Championship on Dec. 6, when they beat BYU for a second time this season. The No. 5 Ducks (12-1) tuned up with a 51-34 victory against James Madison in the first round on Dec. 20. The winner of this game will face the Indiana-Alabama winner in a semifinal on Jan. 9 in the Peach Bowl. Kickoff from Hard Rock Stadium is set for Noon ET on New Year's Day. The Ducks are 2.5-point favorites in the latest SportsLine consensus Texas Tech vs. Oregon odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 51.5. Oregon is a -134 money line favorite (bet $134 to win $100), while the Red Raiders are +112 underdogs. Before you make any Texas Tech vs. Oregon picks of your own, make sure you see the top college football picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times.\nWhere to watch Oregon vs. Texas Tech on ThursdayWhen: Thursday, Jan. 1Time: Noon ETTV: ESPNStream: Fubo  Follow along: CBS Sports AppOregon vs. Texas Tech betting previewOdds: Oregon -2.5, Over/Under 51.5Texas Tech has the nation's second-best scoring offense, averaging 42.5 points per game, and also ranks second in scoring defense (10.8 ppg). The Ducks are in the top 10 on both offense (19 ppg) and defense (16.3 ppg). Oregon had the tougher road to get here, with TTU's best wins against Utah and BYU twice and the loss coming against Arizona State. The Ducks beat then-No. 3 Penn State and have top-25 victories against USC and Iowa, with their only loss to CFP top seed Indiana. Texas Tech quarterback Behren Morton missed the Arizona State loss with a knee injury but he leads an offense that averages 289.4 passing yards per game (ninth in FBS). Morton has 2,643 passing yards with 22 touchdowns and four interceptions despite missing two full games and parts of two others. Oregon counterpart Dante Moore has 3,046 passing yards with 28 TDs and eight interceptions, throwing for at least 250 in his past four games. Texas Tech leads the nation with 31 takeaways and is plus-17 in turnover margin, while Oregon has 17 (T-53) and is plus-6. Texas Tech is 12-1 against the spread this season, while Oregon is 8-5. The teams last met in 2023, a 38-20 Ducks victory in Lubbock. The Red Raiders have lost all three meetings between the teams, with the others coming in 1991 (16-13) and '92 (28-13). Oregon has relied more on its high-powered offense, so it has seen some higher totals and is 7-6 to the Over while TTU's defense has kept scores low, and the Red Raiders have gone Under in eight of their 13 games. The total has gone Under in eight of Tech's past 12 games when it was the underdog. Neither team has been good against the spread in January, with Oregon 2-4 ATS in its past six in the month and TTU 1-4 in its past five.Model's Oregon vs. Texas Tech score prediction, picksThe Ducks are winning in 61% of the SportsLine Projection Model's simulations and are covering 58% of the time. The Over comes in at a 57% clip, with the model showing both teams scoring more than 25 points. The Red Raiders have failed to reach 29 points once all season -- in the loss to ASU with their starting QB out -- and Oregon has been held under 29 four times. The Sagarin Ratings put Oregon at 14th in strength of schedule and Texas Tech 68th, so the competition level is a factor in evaluating this matchup.Oregon vs. Texas Tech score prediction: Oregon 32, Texas Tech 26Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Oregon vs. Texas Tech.

    "body": "\nThe final 'Monday Night Football' game of the 2025 NFL regular season will take place in Week 17 as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Atlanta Falcons. The Rams (11-4) are coming off a Thursday defeat to Seattle, 38-37 in overtime, but L.A. has already clinched a playoff berth. The Falcons (6-9) have been knocked out of postseason contention but enter off back-to-back victories, last defeating Arizona, 26-19. Drake London (knee) is questionable for Atlanta, while Davante Adams (hamstring) is doubtful for LA. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After opening at -8, the latest Falcons vs. Rams from DraftKings Sportsbook have Los Angeles as the 7-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5, down a point from the opening line. L.A. is at -365 on the money line (risk $365 to win $100). Before making any Rams vs. Falcons     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Now, the model has zeroed in on Atlanta vs. Los Angeles.

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense and is 5-1 over his last six 'MNF' starts, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks. Finally, L.A. is just 4-7 ATS over its last 11 with a rest edge, as it enters in off a Thursday game. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Falcons vs. Rams            picksFor Rams vs. Falcons   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\nThe last chance to make 'Monday Night Football' DFS picks in the regular season comes in Week 17 as the Rams visit the Falcons at 8:15 p.m. ET. Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite, while the over/under is 49.5. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Bijan Robinson are the first names many will gravitate to when scouring the NFL DFS player pool, but both teams have potential daily Fantasy sleepers. Xavier Smith and Konata Mumpfield have absorbed most of Davante Adams' (doubtful, hamstring) snaps, while Tyler Allgeier is coming off a season-high of 79 rushing yards. None of these underrated options would do too much damage to your NFL DFS salary cap.Additionally, just three teams have allowed more Fantasy points to kickers than the Falcons, which should put Rams kciker Harrison Mevis on your radar. Should you insert him into NFL DFS lineups instead of the likes of Blake Corum or Darnell Mooney? Before making any Rams vs. Falcons DFS picks, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Bijan Robinson as anytime TD scorer (-130) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Rams vs. FalconsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Rams wideout Puka Nacua, who has an over/under of 106.5 receiving yards. The league leader in receptions (114) is coming off the best game of his career last Thursday when he set or matched career highs in both yards (225) and touchdowns (2). Nacua has at least 167 receiving yards in three straight games, with four scores over that span. He has a great chance of hitting pay dirt versus an Atlanta defense which has seen five of its last six passing TDs allowed end up in the hands of opposing wide receivers. See who else to roster at SportsLine.You can also bet on Nacua to go Over 106.5 receiving yards (-113) at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also rostering Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins. The veteran has accounted for three total touchdowns in back-to-back games. Improved offensive line protection for Atlanta is allowing the team to see the best of Cousins, and he gets to face a suddenly leaky Rams defense. The last four QBs it has faced have averaged 271.5 passing yards and 2.5 passing touchdowns, with the likes of Jacoby Brissett and Bryce Young included in that quartet. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.Bet Cousins to go Over 1.5 touchdown passes (+147) at DraftKings:\nHow to set Falcons vs. Rams NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today's unfortunate accident.\"Joshua was targeting a quick return to the ring following his victory over Paul, with promoter Eddie Hearn pointing to a possible bout with kickboxer Rico Verhoeven in late February or early March while they awaited a showdown with fellow former British heavyweight champion Tyson Fury later in 2026. That timeline for a return to the ring is now in question and will depend on the injuries he sustained and how long it will take for him to fully heal. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) will be a part of that effort remains up in the air as Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters Monday that the team will have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice.\"It's to be determined,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.\"Jackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson. \nFurthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.\"A+,\" Harbaugh said after the game. \"A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.\"\nHarbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.\n            ",

The uniforms the Bills will wear Sunday were the franchise's primary home uniform from 1987-2001. During that span, the Bills became the first team to appear in four consecutive Super Bowls, doing so from 1990-93.\"There's no better way to celebrate our fans and honor our team's history by bringing back the red helmets,\" Bills COO Pete Guelli said when the team initially announced that it would wear its Super Bowl-era uniforms in Week 18. \"The Bills provided this region with some of the most incredible moments in franchise history in the 1990s wearing these helmets and we feel this is a great way to commemorate the closing of Highmark Stadium in our regular season finale.\" \nHighmark Stadium, which opened in 1973, has hosted some of the most iconic teams and games in NFL history, including the largest comeback in playoff history, when the Bills overcame a 35-3 deficit to defeat the Houston Oilers in the wild-card round of the 1992 playoffs.\nBuffalo hosted three AFC title games at Highmark Stadium during the early 1990s, winning each time by a combined score of 91-23.On Sunday, the Bills will wear the uniforms they wore when they recorded the greatest comeback in postseason history 33 years earlier.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            There's a very good chance Sunday may be Buffalo's final game at Highmark Stadium after the Patriots secured their first AFC East title since 2019. Buffalo can only host a playoff game this year if it and a lower-seeded team are able to advance to the AFC Championship Game.\nCurrently, the AFC's seventh-seeded team, Buffalo (11-5), could move up to the fifth seed this weekend, but it would require a win over the Jets as well as a Texans loss to the Colts and a Chargers loss to the Broncos. Los Angeles will be short-handed against Denver, as it will be resting several starters, including quarterback Justin Herbert.\n            \n    ",

The No. 1 overall prospect in the class of 2027, Jacobs committed to the Buckeyes live on CBS Sports HQ over a laundry list of high-level suitors -- including Miami, which was the perceived favorite headed into the announcement. \"Massive shocker,\" said Andrew Ivins, the Director of Scouting for 247Sports. \"Ohio State is putting it all together and I love the fit. Defensive line coach Larry Johnson is perfect for Jacobs given what he's done with kids.\" Jacobs is the ninth player to commit to Ohio State during the 2027 cycle. \nMiami is not the only program wondering what went awry with one of the best defensive line prospects of the modern recruiting era. Jacobs preps at Blessed Trinity Catholic High School in Roswell, Georgia -- and he's a double Georgia legacy. His father, David, played defensive line for the Bulldogs and his mom, Desiree, played basketball at Georgia. Former Georgia coach Mark Richt is DJ's godfather.\"Cast-iron edge defender with the size, speed and strength to wreak havoc on Saturdays and then Sundays.\" 247Sports Director of Scouting Andrew Ivins wrote in his evaluation of Jacobs. \"Projects as a future difference-maker for a College Football Playoff contender that can set the edge and get after the quarterback.\" \nShould Jacobs keep his No. 1 ranking in the 2027 class, he would be the first defensive end prospect to maintain that ranking since the 2019 class. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The head-turning news of Baylor adding 21-year-old big man James Nnaji, a 2023 NBA Draft pick, has reverberated around college athletics. It's not just that Baylor is bringing on someone who was drafted 30 months ago, it's also that he's eligible immediately and could make his collegiate debut this Saturday when Baylor faces TCU in its Big 12 opener. While a number of programs have plumbed into the G League and international pipelines to add players in recent weeks/months, Baylor paved a new pathway when it went to the NCAA and asked it to clear the 7-footer with more than four years of EuroLeague experience. Never until now had someone who was selected in the NBA Draft been approved to play college basketball.As far as I can tell, no one had ever even tried. With good reason. The notion of rostering a professional athlete runs counter to the very essence of what the NCAA purported to stand for since its inception almost 120 years ago. But those pillars have crumbled to rubble at this point, and as we turn to 2026, the NCAA has but only a few rules left that might withstand any viable legal challenges. Still, even if Nnaji's case is allowable, that doesn't mean it's accepted or even feels proper. I reached out to nearly 10 coaches on Monday to get a grasp on how they felt about it. Most had no problem with Baylor coach Scott Drew doing what he felt he needed to do because none of it is impermissible and because other schools (BYU, Oklahoma, Washington, Dayton, Santa Clara, Louisville), have done the same as of late. \n\n        \n            \n                How Baylor landed ex-NBA pick James Nnaji and what coaches are saying about the controversial acquisition\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMost of the coaches I reached out to Monday morning got back to me relatively quickly, but the most notable of them all didn't respond until Monday night. That person just so happens to be the man who's arguably the face of college basketball.I texted Dan Hurley and asked for his thoughts on the situation at Baylor and the state of college hoops as it sees its rostering rules updated practically by the week. The UConn coach left me a nearly three-minute long voice memo, and instead of chopping up all the quotes and dispersing them throughout the story, I want to present what he said in full. Hurley was introspective, direct, largely unedited and entirely earnest about what he believes college basketball needs right now.\nBased on conversations I've had in recent days and weeks, these thoughts also reflect the feelings and intentions of a lot of his fellow coaches.Here's Hurley to CBS Sports:\"I would just say with the players, obviously with all the G League (guys), I just had no idea that that was even an option. I thought it was actually a joke when I saw it. I just assumed that when you stay in the draft or you get drafted that you would forgo your college eligibility. I was not aware of the loopholes in it. My biggest thing I would say is, listen, player empowerment's great. Players have to do what they can to make sure that they're doing what's in their best interest. They're taking advantage of those opportunities now with NIL and the portal. The coaches are obviously always gonna do what's in their best interest if they can grab a player from somewhere. It's gone on forever. Coaches have cheated in recruiting for years. They've paid players. I mean, the coaches are gonna find ways to make their team the best they can be.But I would say my biggest thing is: who's looking out for the shield, the college basketball (shield)? Who's protecting college basketball, one of the most special things we have in sports. College basketball, March Madness, the second biggest annual sporting event every year. We need a commissioner. We need rules, we need guidelines.The frustrating part is we all are willing to adapt and play this new game in this new era of, I guess college sports, or whether it's G League -- I don't know what we're in exactly right now -- but it's a frustrating game to play when you don't know the rules and rules are being made up as you go and there's no communication and there's no leadership. So, I think college basketball needs a commissioner. A (Roger) Goodell. A David Stern. Somebody that's gonna make decisions and start making moves that are in the best interest of college basketball, not just having coaches and players do what's in the best interest of them.\"Hurley understandably lands on the receiving end of a lot of criticism and commentary for his sideline behavior at times, or for what he'll sometimes say on a microphone. But in my experience, I find his passion and devotion to college basketball as earnest and large as any coach in the game.If you're a college basketball fan reading this, someone who just loves the game to its core, know that Dan Hurley is wired just like you. He not only loves it because he's a coach, he loves it because he grew up on it. He is a college basketball junkie.This is a guy who could have left UConn after back-to-back titles, when he was on a throne at the mountaintop of the sport, to take the Lakers job.He could have left NIL and the portal and the mangled mess of policies and non-policies that have plagued college basketball and the NCAA more and more and more in recent years. It would have been very easy to do and no one could have critiqued him for doing it. But he came back.\nHe stayed at UConn. He chose college basketball.Hurley stayed for a lot of reasons, of course. High on that list of reasons is his belief that college basketball is a great American sport. There is a spirit to the game that is unmatched. Hurley believes media companies — and even many of the coaches themselves — have failed at properly marketing the game in the past five, 10, 15 years. He wants more for it. He wants it to be better. Believes it can and should be. The sport is already amazing, but it could be so much bigger if it was handled and promoted the way college football and the NFL are.Hurley's pitch for a commissioner isn't new, and it might not be practical in practice, but when a coach of his stature speaks out, everyone who claims to care about the health of the game should listen. Read his statement again and understand that he's just asking for real guidance and real leadership. College basketball and college football need collective bargaining as soon as possible. Reality is, that's not happening for a very long time. Even still, we shouldn't let the hope of that longterm goal stunt progress. There are pragmatic ways to redefine the rulebook of college basketball in this precarious next era for the sport. When a former NBA pick can make the choice to play college basketball, that's not the fault of the player or the coach. That's the fault of the system and all the people at the NCAA who've failed it along the way — for decades. And while Nnaji's commitment to Baylor doesn't threaten college basketball's existence, it is the latest event to give the foundation of the sport its largest crack yet.\nA lot of these changes, a lot of those cracks, have pushed some of the biggest legends out of the game on an accelerated timeline in the past five years. Now another one is sounding the alarms, and if real change doesn't happen in 2026 and 2027, Hurley and others like him in college basketball (and college football) could find their way out of the NCAA business faster than anyone who loves college sports wants to admit.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Week 18 in the NFL is more important for some teams than others. There are divisions like the NFC South and AFC North that have yet to be clinched, while there are other teams that have already clinched playoff spots, and can rest their starters. The Los Angeles Chargers are one of those teams.On Monday, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters that quarterback Justin Herbert will not start in the regular-season finale against the Denver Broncos. This means that Trey Lance will make his first start of the year. In addition to Herbert, Harbaugh said that the other starters with \"the most bruises\" and that need \"the most healing\" won't play either. \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Chargers are 11-5 and have clinched a wild card spot. They currently occupy the No. 6 seed in the AFC behind the Houston Texans and ahead of the Buffalo Bills, both of whom are also 11-5. The Chargers will be playing on the road in wild card weekend regardless of Sunday's outcome in Denver, although the opponent is yet to be determined. While the seeding implications for the Chargers are minor, the team's decision to sit Herbert is a notable development for the Broncos, who at 13-3 are currently the No. 1 seed in the AFC. To keep that top spot and officially clinch a valuable first-round bye, the Broncos need to beat the Chargers. \nThe Broncos share the same record with the New England Patriots but own the common games tiebreaker. The Broncos were the first AFC team to clinch a playoff berth this year, and now may have the easiest road to Super Bowl LX in the conference. \n            \n    ",

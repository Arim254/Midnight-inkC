    "body": "\n        Compared to some of the other teams in this edition of the UEFA Champions League, Club Brugge are not necessarily a slouch, especially so after journeying to the round of 16 last season. A clash against Belgium's second best team is never one that stands out on a long list of league phase fixtures, though, especially when a Lamine Yamal-led Barcelona are scheduled for a visit to the port city. It was destined to be a routine away game for Hansi Flick's side, likely to offer few takeaways on a day where other European titans were theoretically playing much more competitive games. Barcelona, though, had as much fun as Colin Farrell's Ray did in \"In Bruges,\" a film famously focused on how much Ray hates his forced work trip to the city.\nBarcelona were not quite as miserable as Ray, in large part because Yamal makes that impossible. The 18-year-old was once again the star of his side's show, forcing an own goal and notching another otherworldly goal to his already impressive tally. His run through traffic and strike from a tight angle may be the highlight-reel worthy moment with the most longevity on an entertaining day at the Jan Breydel Stadium. Leave it to Flick's Barcelona, though, to ensure Yamal's individual brilliance would not be enough to come out with all three points on Wednesday – the visitors instead had to settle for a 3-3 draw, their vulnerabilities fully exposed by Club Brugge.One of the defining features of Flick's Barcelona is their steadfast commitment to a high line, all while making the bet that their attacking might would be enough to overpower the deficit in defense. It is not an irrational calculation, but it comes with its drawbacks; it may only be slightly surprising that a Paris Saint-Germain team missing its stars can pick that lock, but as it turns out, Club Brugge can also wreak havoc over Barcelona's back line.Carlos Forbs had an outing he will likely remember for the rest of his life with two goals and an assist against Barcelona, almost completely at ease as he contributed to each of his side's goals. There was a sense of repetition as he inched close to goal – whether Brugge were in possession or Barcelona sent numbers forward, the prospect of dropping back way down on the list of priorities. Time after time, all Brugge needed was a quick little play – finding the space was easy, it was all about making small adjustments in the moment. Forbs contorted his body to receive the ball and evaded the offside flag as he received a pass and made a run before Nicolo Tresoldi had the chance for a tap-in on the first. Forbs made a run that resembled Tresoldi's for the second and did it one final time for the third, an example in how practice makes perfect.\n\"i don't want to talk about my old club like that, but you've got to call a spade a spade,\" Thierry Henry said on the UEFA Champions League post-match show, not mincing his words. \"You can't carry on defending like this.\"Barcelona have given their opponents a lot of practice in the last year and change, as well as examples for them to pull from. Brugge became the latest team to execute a tried-and-true game plan – 24.8% possession and 10 shots were no issue for Nicky Hayen's side. Barcelona provided the perfect pathway to generate 2.06 expected goals, nearly equal to their tally of 2.10 expected goals from 22 shots. Even on days where Barcelona win, it is a counterproductive strategy, creating nervier game states than need be.\"I can't bypass the fact that you keep on letting people go and run at your goal,\" Henry said. \"If you're a team now, if you didn't do your due diligence that Barcelona play a high line and you don't make the late run … Late runs. You can go and do it every single time! Why would you put yourself in a situation when you're going to make yourself suffer alone? No disrespect to what Brugge did, but you defend the ball and you defend your goal. You don't just defend the ball when there is no pressure on it, and you let people run left and right, and then they have chances left and right every single time. That's not really something that you want to do. You're supposed to erase mistakes, not create them yourself.\"\nThe game plan is flawed on its own but the issues are exacerbated by Barcelona's personnel, who are ill-equipped for a very specific tactical approach. A lot of terrific defenders may not fit Flick's strategy but Barcelona do not boast a single world-class defender, boasting neither the speed to balance the demands of a possession-oriented, attack-minded team nor the strong defensive skill to withstand an opponent's quick attack. The problem, as always, is rooted in the club's financial mismanagement – when they find a new loophole in LaLiga's rules to spend money, they do so on attackers and when that fails, they boast an academy that generates incredible offensive players like Yamal. There is never really enough money at Barcelona to sign one world-class defender, let alone several.Wojciech Szczesny, meanwhile, may be an upgrade on Inaki Pena but the once-retired goalkeeper only offers so much upside in goal. He is equally responsible for defensive lapses as Barcelona's back line is, VAR coming to his rescue late in the game against Brugge and ensuring the hosts would not actually take all three points. As long as Barcelona remain in financial ruin – which feels like their reality for the foreseeable future – there may be no obvious personnel fix to these problems.\nIt may not be all his fault but the problems are perhaps Flick's alone to solve, though how willing the manager is to change his approach is a different story. As managers like Arne Slot, Xabi Alonso, Vincent Kompany and Luis Enrique find success with genuine defensive resolve, Flick appears to be their ideological foil, perhaps unsurprising for someone who is a generation older than most of them. He will have his justifications – not only can Barcelona get away with it more often than not, they won a domestic double last season with the same exact approach. If he makes wholesale changes to his tactics, it would come as a genuine shock, even if it feels more and more like an imperfect strategy.\nWhen \"In Bruges\" Ray asks, \"Do you think this is good?\" it almost feels like he is asking about Barcelona's unsustainable approach to winning the Champions League, but as Brendan Gleeson's Ken retorts, \"Yes, I do. It's called sightseeing.\" There's only one champion at the end of the season, and though it's too early to make a final judgment, it really might not be Barcelona's year. They make for a much more entertaining spectacle than the landmarks Ray sulks around over the course of \"In Bruges,\" though, like a film one cannot help but rewatch over and over again. There's always entertainment value in a Barcelona game, even if they make the same mistakes time and time again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys' defense needed a hero following a 3-5-1 start to the 2025 season that was accentuated by a deflating 27-17 \"Monday Night Football\" loss against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 9. The absence of All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons following owner and general manager Jerry Jones' decision to trade him away to the Green Bay Packers a week before the 2025 has certainly been felt through the first half of the year. His departure is one of a few reasons the Cowboys are the NFL's second-worst scoring defense (30.8 points per game allowed) after nine games. That's why Jones made the move at Tuesday's NFL trade deadline to acquire 27-year-old All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams from the New York Jets.\"Definitely was surprised by it. It's unbelievable though, man, to be able to come to an organization where there's so much history, so much talent on the team, great ownership, and great group of guys in the locker room and a great head coach and the things these guys are doing here,\" Williams said on Wednesday. \"So I'm super happy to be a part of this. Super happy to be a part of this defensive line group that's super loaded and super talented with [defensive tackles] Kenny Clark and O [Osa Odighizuwa] and [edge rusher] Dante Fowler and [defensive line] coach Aaron [Whitecotton], man. It's unbelievable to go to work with those guys. I'm looking forward to it.\"Dallas is also certainly looking forward to his Cowboys debut on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 11 after a bye in Week 10. Based on what Jones and the Dallas front office gave up to acquire him, the hope is his All-Pro presence can be the driving force that reignites a struggling defensive unit under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. That expectation is something Williams embraces, but he knows his production will come in a different form than Parsons' 12-sacks-a-year production from 2021 to 2024. His 40.0 career sacks are the third-most among 300-pound players since he entered the league as the third overall draft pick in 2019, and he's been a Pro Bowler in each of the last three seasons.  \n\"It's pretty cool man,\" Williams said of those expectations. \"Micah Parsons is a phenomenal player. He can do things where I can't dream about doing, especially [when] it comes down to rushing the passer. We're totally different players, man, in that aspect. I'm more interior presence, interior push, physical, strong and a good interior pass rusher. I'm just here to do my job to the best of my ability and be a difference maker from the interior standpoint and the defensive line standpoint the best way I can.\"The Cowboys' struggles defending against the pass (254.4 passing yards per game allowed, 30th in the NFL) are new this season, but their issues against the run have been an issue for years. The 2025 season is no different with Dallas allowing the fourth-most rushing yards per game (143.0) this season. That's an area in which Williams can make an immediate impact since his 13 runs stuffs for a loss or no gain are the second-most in the NFL this season, according to Next Gen Stats via NFL Research.   \"I hang my hat on being disruptive, being dominant and rushing the passer and also taking a step forward in stopping the run. I know, I've been reading a lot of stuff and seeing a lot of stuff on Dallas not stopping the run, so having the opportunity to come here and help those guys out of that and just help turn this thing around when it comes down to that point, it's going to be unbelievable for me,\" Williams said. \"To learn from Osa and Kenny Clark and the defensive line, it's going to be unbelievable and also show them and lean on them and teach them different things also. To be around a great group of guys, man, a great defense for the last few years, man is going to be fun.\"\nWilliams is also thrilled to reunite with Cowboys defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who worked as his position coach with the Jets from 2021 to 2024 before the latter joined new coach Brian Schottenheimer's staff in Dallas in 2025. After just a year of Whitecotton's tutelage in 2021, Williams broke out for a career-high 12.0 sacks in 2022 en route to earning first team All-Pro honors, the start of three consecutive Pro Bowl seasons. \"I think anybody can look at the resume. Before I had Whitecotton, I kind of was ... I set out to be a good DT. When Whitecotton came into my life as a coach, I became an All-Pro and a Pro Bowler. The techniques that he has taught me, the things that he has done for me in my career when it comes down to coaching and stuff like that, have been unbelievable and kind of transcended my career to this day,\" Williams said. \"So being paired back with him, I know the sky's the limit, not only for me but for this group also. Because a lot of these guys in this defensive line room are in their first year with Whitecotton also, I know the things he's done for me and the things he helped me with to be the player that I am today, he can help that whole group out.\"  Whitecotton himself naturally deflected the credit back to Williams, but it's clear their connection will shine brightly right away. Dallas' defensive line coach said he typically first looks to connect personally with a new player that's added to his position room in the event of a trade of free agency signing, but he and Williams can skip right ahead to the X's and O's now because of their preexisting relationship.  \n\"I think that was a young man who works his butt and who is talented come to fruition,\" Whitecotton said on Wednesday. \"When he first got to New York, it had nothing to do with me, but before I was there he took a lot of criticism as a rookie for 'hey, this guy is the third overall pick. He's not doing this, he's not doing that.' All of us here, it took us some time to master our craft and really get good at what we're doing. He was trying to understand the league. ... I think once he found his stride as a professional and then got comfortable in what he was doing, you saw the work ethic and talent pay off.\"\n        \n            \n                Cowboys trade deadline deals: Time will tell if blow of trading Micah Parsons is softened after haul\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWilliams' fit in Dallas Williams is now joining a defensive line with two other well-paid defensive tackles in 30-year-old, three-time Pro Bowler Kenny Clark, a player Williams said he has long admired by watching film and 27-year-old Osa Odighizuwa. So how will all three of them play together? Whitecotton said there will obviously be rotations where all three still receive a starter's level of game reps, but there will also be a higher utilization of five-down fronts. That's where a defense has five defensive linemen in the game along the line of scrimmage instead of the typical four. That adjustment translated into results for Dallas' pass rush collectively as they tied the team's single-game high in sacks with five against Arizona quarterback Jacoby Brissett in Week 9, something the Cowboys also accomplished in Week 5 against Jets quarterback Justin Fields. \"Whatever my job is to do, man. Most of the coach's job is to figure out how that's going to happen. Like I said, they're two elite defensive tackles, man. Not great. I mean all great and elite when it comes down to the things they both do,\" Williams said of figuring out how to fit alongside Clark and Odighizuwa. \"I know Kenny Clark. I studied his film like no other when he was at Green Bay, and the two-tech rushing he did have. I love to see O, the things he's done recently the last two to three years: the pass rush and the run stopping that he has and the disruptiveness he has also. You got Solomon Thomas in that room also, who I'm very familiar with. So I'm just super ecstatic to be a part of a group of guys that not only I can learn from, grow with but work alongside.\"\nSchottenheimer said the Cowboys see Williams as \"most disruptive inside\" at the defensive tackle position, but he's willing to kick out to edge rusher from time to time to accommodate Clark and Odighizuwa. That's something Odighizuwa himself also said he's happy to do to accommodate Williams.  \"I think I pride myself in that [versatility], because at the end of the day, if I can be on the field and do the things I know I can do, I can be a help to this defense and a help to this team to win football games,\" Williams said. \"So no matter what they ask me to do, no matter what they want me to do, if it's to get all three of us on the field, moving to D-end for a couple of plays, I'm willing to do that. Whatever they ask me to do, man, I pride myself on being the best player and best person I can be in the locker room and on the field.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the most basic terms Erling Haaland, Manchester City captain for the second time, led his team mates in much the same fashion that he has throughout his three years and change in England. Skippers can smash heads together, they can run themselves into the ground, but really there is no better way to set an example than by doing your job to the best of your abilities.Yet again Haaland did exactly that, a thundering back stick strike to cap an elegant City move, killing off any hopes his former club Borussia Dortmund might have had of overturning the lead Phil Foden had carved out seven minutes earlier. This was the Haaland that has obliterated defenses throughout his career. He holds court at the second post, waiting for the ball to come to him and knowing that when he does he will make no mistake. That is how you end up with 18 goals in 14 club games this season. That is what might win you the Ballon d'Or.Then again, if City are going to win trophies they are going to need that scintilla more from their best player than what he has delivered over the past few years. Even on a night where Foden scored a brilliant brace, this is the most heliocentric City have been under Pep Guardiola. Depending on your view of the final Lionel Messi Barcelona sides, this might be the most star reliant any elite club has been this century.In such circumstances it becomes incumbent on Haaland to make life easier for those around him, to do more than take up a scoring position and wait for the ball to come his way. Sometimes he has to go get it and exploit that gravity of his in different fashions. It would be a joy to see more of that iteration, there are few sights as exhilarating in any sport as Haaland playing the equivalent of a basketball point forward, the sort of barnstorming run he unleashed in the 27th minute tonight. After a quickly taken free kick by Nico Gonzalez, space opened up in front of the Dortmund back three. On Haaland drove, Felix Nmecha clinging onto his left shoulder and Waldemar Anton barely able to keep up with the marauding Norseman. The rest of the defense did what is only natural in such circumstances, they collapsed towards the ball, four bodies converging on Haaland, none alone able to slow the freight train flying at them. And then with a deft touch that you might not immediately associate with him, Haaland popped the ball off to his right. An unmarked Nico O'Reilly had perhaps gone a moment too soon, or maybe the pass was a smidge misplaced. Whatever the explanation, the shot was a slightly underpowered hook but it still took a fine save from Gregor Kobel to deny Haaland his assist.\nEven so, his team mates rushed over to the City captain, garlanding him with as much adulation as he would get for the winner a few moments later. They know how effective this Haaland can be, the Haaland who, as Thierry Henry put it pre-match, \"used to play the game,\" but is now \"thinking it.\"\n\"He understands that it isn't Kevin De Bruyne or Joao Cancelo delivering the crosses to him anymore. Haaland needs to make it easier for his team mates to find him.\" As Henry noted, that means runs across goal, a little more movement and a little less waiting for the ball to come. Haaland's movement isn't just creating chances for himself but space for others. That much was apparent for City's opener. When the ball came to Foden, his skipper could just have powered up the gut in expectation of a through ball. Instead he curled his run outside the right center back in Dortmund's back three. That defender had to follow Haaland which meant the one in the middle couldn't step up to the ball. The two yards of space that created were more than enough for Foden to spot his line and roll it into the far corner.\nPerhaps some of this is ascribing greater selflessness to Haaland than might be the case. The changing of his runs might be focused on making life easier for his teammates, or it might be about a striker hell bent on goals concluding that he is going to have to do a bit more himself now that De Bruyne isn't around to put chances on a plate for him. Ultimately it doesn't really matter. Haaland has not just made himself better this season. He has begun to make his team mates better. That is an intimidating prospect for those yet to face City.\n            ",

When New Orleans goes on the clock in the 2026 NFL Draft, Shough will almost certainly become the latest high-round pick whose team uses an even higher-round pick 12 months later in the hopes of upgrading the position.The Panthers did it in 2011 when they took Cam Newton No. 1 overall, and the Cardinals did it eight years later when they selected Kyler Murray with the top pick. And as we sit here, nine weeks into the 2026 season, the Saints are staring that first-overall selection in the face.There will no doubt be discussions in the building about trading down and what such a draft haul might do to reset this roster, but if the organization feels that Fernando Mendoza or Ty Simpson or Dante Moore is Their Guy, then those discussions will be short. Former Titans GM Ran Carthon and I talked about this last week on \"With the First Pick,\" our NFL Draft podcast:\nIn my Mock Draft 2.0, I have just three QBs going in the first round -- and one via trade; after trading down from No. 2 to No. 5 last April, the Browns move up from No. 6 to No. 2 in this excerise for a quarterback. And much like the conversation surrounding Shough, it's fair to assume that neither Dylan Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders (or any other QB currently on Cleveland's roster) will be penciled in as the 2026 starter before the draft. (In my previous mock last month, I had five QBs taken, but there's a decent chance USC's Jayden Maiava returns to school and Oklahoma's John Mateer hasn't been nearly the player he was prior to an injury to his throwing hand.)In this version, I have seven offensive linemen, six edge rushers, five cornerbacks -- and in light of the Jets trading Sauce Gardner to the Colts at the trade deadline (for two first-rounders!) -- four wide receivers. The Jets now join the Browns, Rams and Cowboys with two real-life first-round picks in the 2026 NFL Draft.\nOK, let's get to it (just a reminder, this is the draft order, via Tankathon, after Week 9.NFL Mock DraftRound 1\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 trade deadline day was one of the most eventful in recent history. Blockbuster trades aren't the norm on deadline day. The New York Jets were involved in two monumental trades.Cornerback Sauce Gardner, who earned first-team All-Pro honors in his first two NFL seasons (2022 and 2023), was dealt to the Indianapolis Colts for a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell. Defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, a 2022 first-team All-Pro, was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a 2026 second-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick and defensive tackle Mazi Smith. The 2027 first-round pick is the higher of the Cowboys' or the Green Bay Packers' from the Micah Parsons trade.The Jets dealing Gardner was a major surprise given he signed a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension with $85,653,473 of guarantees, where $45,153,473 was fully guaranteed at signing in July. At $30.1 million per year, the deal made Gardner the NFL's highest-paid cornerback. It's interesting that Jets head coach Aaron Glenn, who was a three-time Pro Bowl cornerback during his 15-year NFL career, was willing to part ways with Gardner.The Jets are in a position to control the 2026 and/or 2027 NFL Drafts. The trades give the Jets two first-round picks and two second-round picks in 2026. There are three first-round picks and a second-round pick in 2027. The Jets have the draft capital to move up if necessary to find a potential quarterback of the future in one of these NFL Drafts.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL trade deadline: Jets have NFL's longest playoff drought, which just got longer but might be worth it\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are three more trades that should have been made before the deadline that may have improved teams' chances of making the postseason or go on a deep playoff run. The financial ramifications of the moves are highlighted. Salary-cap space is based on NFLPA data.The Miami Dolphins were open to trading wide receiver Jaylen Waddle. He is not included. Miami's asking price was reportedly a first-round pick and additional considerations. The offseason is a better time for the Dolphins to try to deal Waddle since there could be more potential suitors. Waddle is under contract through the 2028 season. He is scheduled to make $68.616 million over the next three years (2026 through 2028).An acquiring team would have needed enough salary-cap room to absorb the remainder of the player's current salary. Since the trades would have occurred after Week 9's games, the acquiring team would have been responsible for 9/18ths of a player's 2025 base salary and any other applicable salary components in his contract.\nTrades can't be executed again until the 2026 league year begins on March 11.Trey Hendrickson (Edge): Bengals ➡️ 49ersTrade compensation: 2026 second-round pickHendrickson remaining 2025 salary: $9,411,765 (Bengals 2025 salary cap savings)49ers 2025 salary cap room: $20.239 millionBengals 2026 dead money: $6.5 million (2026 voiding contract year)The 49ers' pass rush has been decimated by injuries. 2022 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa was lost to a torn right ACL three games into the season. 2025 first-round pick Mykel Williams is also out for the season after tearing his right ACL in Week 9's game versus the New York Giants. Bryce Huff has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury, but could return for Week 10's contest against the Los Angeles Rams.The lack of a pass rush was apparent in Week 8's 26-15 loss to the Houston Texans. The 49ers didn't record any sacks and only had two quarterback hits.Hendrickson and the Bengals were engaged in an acrimonious contract dispute during the offseason in which he received permission to seek a trade. The Bengals were reportedly looking for more than a first-round pick in return for Hendrickson prior to the 2025 NFL Draft.\nHendrickson and the Bengals couldn't reach an agreement on a contract extension to ensure that he would remain in Cincinnati beyond this season. Instead, Hendrickson received an adjustment to his 2025 salary as a compromise to end his hold-in as the start of the regular season was approaching. The 2024 NFL sack leader got a $13 million raise to increase his 2025 compensation from $16 million to $29 million.\nNo team was willing to meet Cincinnati's reduced asking price of a first-round pick to acquire Hendrickson, who turns 31 in December, at the trade deadline. A first-round pick isn't consistent with the acquisition price of pass rushers in a contract year in transactions at or near the trade deadline in recent years.The 49ers aren't strangers to short-term rentals for pass help. 2020 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Chase Young was obtained from the Washington Commanders for a 2024 third-round compensatory pick in 2023. Hendrickson is clearly a better player now than Young was when that trade was made.\nThe Commanders received a 2024 second-round pick from the Chicago Bears for Montez Sweat in 2023. This trade was done with the idea that Sweat would remain in Chicago long term. Less than two weeks after the trade, the Bears signed Sweat to a four-year, $98 million extension averaging $24.5 million per year.The Rams dealt 2022 second- and third-round picks to the Denver Broncos for Von Miller, who was 32, in 2021. The Broncos eating $9 million of Miller's remaining $9,722,222 in 2021 salary increased the trade compensation.The Bengals face an uphill battle to make the playoffs with a 3-6 record and a historically bad defense. According to The Athletic's playoff simulator, Cincinnati has a 2% chance of making the postseason. Retaining Hendrickson, who is battling a hip injury, for the rest of the season makes the most sense if Cincinnati's intention is designating him as a franchise player in 2026.\nHendrickson's 2025 salary-cap number increased by $6.5 million to $25,166,668 because a 2026 contract year automatically voiding five days after Super Bowl LX on Feb. 13 was added in the process, so the new $13 million is being prorated. There are $3 million of per-game roster bonuses that are a part of the proration because of timing of Hendrickson's contract adjustment (after the last preseason game). Given the way the 120% of prior year's salary provisions operate for franchise tags, it will cost the Bengals $30.2 million to use the designation on Hendrickson.The Bengals could still trade Hendrickson after making him a franchise player. Hendrickson would likely rather have his freedom than being restricted by a franchise tag.Breece Hall (RB) and 2027 sixth-round pick: Jets ➡️ ChiefsTrade compensation: 2026 third-round pickRemaining 2025 salary: $1.703 million (Jets 2025 salary-cap savings)Chiefs 2025 salary-cap room: $1,868,662Jets 2026 dead money: None (expiring contract)Trade talks between the Chiefs and Jets apparently broke down over draft capital. The Jets reportedly wanted a third-round pick while the Chiefs were willing to part with a fourth-round pick.\nHall, who is in a contract year, was in favor of a change in scenery after Gardner and Williams were dealt, according to NFL insider Jordan Schultz. The 2022 second-round pick wasn't a contract extension candidate during the offseason because of Glenn's plan to go with a running back-by-committee approach, which was derailed by Braelon Allen's season-ending knee injury.\nHall will likely be looking to get in the same salary stratosphere as James Cook and Kyren Williams, who are fellow running backs from the 2022 draft, in 2026 free agency. Williams signed a three-year, $33 million extension with the Los Angeles Rams during the preseason. Cook's four-year, $46 million extension worth up to $48 million with salary escalators from the Buffalo Bills came several days after Williams' deal.The Jets potentially being major players in offseason free agency because of an abundance of salary-cap room could limit the 2027 compensatory draft pick received if Hall signed elsewhere. An abundance of cap room also puts a franchise tag in play.\nThe 2026 nonexclusive franchise tag for running backs projects to 4.723% of the 2026 salary cap. It's 4.886% in 2025. If the 2026 salary cap is set at $300 million, a 7.45% increase over 2025's $279.2 million salary cap, the running back figure should be $14.171 million.The Chiefs would miss the playoffs for the first time since 2014 if the season ended today after losing to the Bills in Week 9 to drop to 5-4. Hall would have been a nice upgrade over the often-injured Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt at running back. He is on track for his first 1,000-rushing-yard season with 1,235 yards while averaging 5.0 yards per carry. Hall is also a receiving threat out of the backfield.The Chiefs would have needed to restructure a contract because adding Hall would have taken up nearly all the existing cap space. Defensive tackle Chris Jones or offensive guard Trey Smith would have been the most logical candidates because of respective $13.75 million and $10 million 2025 base salaries.\nDavid Njoku (TE): Browns ➡️ PackersTrade compensation: Conditional 2026 fifth-round pick (becomes fourth if Packers make NFC title game and Njoku plays at least 50% of snaps)Remaining 2025 salary: $1,156,912 (Browns salary-cap savings)Packers 2025 cap room: $10.85 millionBrowns 2026 dead money: $24.331 million (voiding 2026–29 contract years)Tucker Kraft was probably headed to the Pro Bowl before he was lost for the season in Week 9's game against the Carolina Panthers with a torn right ACL. He leads NFL tight ends with 15.3 yards per catch. Kraft's six receiving touchdowns are tied for the second most among tight ends. His 489 receiving yards rank third among tight ends.The Packers will rely on 2023 second-round pick Luke Musgrave to step up at tight end in Kraft's absence. Musgrave was selected one round ahead of Kraft in the 2023 NFL Draft. His lacerated kidney as a rookie and left ankle injury last season requiring surgery opened the door for Kraft's emergence.The Browns appear to have found Njoku's replacement in 2025 third-round pick Harold Fannin Jr. He leads the Browns with 38 catches and 352 receiving yards.\nThe most analogous tight end trade around the deadline over the last five years is Zach Ertz in 2021. The Philadelphia Eagles dealt Ertz to the Arizona Cardinals for a 2022 fifth-round pick and cornerback Tay Gowan, who was a 2021 sixth-round pick. Gowan was essentially a throw-in who only played in two games after the trade. The Eagles released him in the 2022 roster cutdown.The Cardinals, who were in win-now mode just like the Packers this season, had a void to fill at tight end because Maxx Williams' right ACL tear five games into the season. Trading Ertz paved the way for Dallas Goedert to become Philadelphia's full-time tight end.The Browns, who have a 2-6 record, were apparently more interested in keeping the offensive weapons intact to evaluate the quarterback situation than an Njoku trade. Njoku is happy that he wasn't dealt.If the Browns are inclined to keep Njoku beyond this season, a new deal would need to be done by Feb. 13 to avoid the $24.331 million cap charge from Njoku's voiding 2026 through 2029 contract years. Turning these voiding contract years into real contract years by this date would keep the existing bonus proration intact instead of accelerating onto Cleveland's 2026 salary cap.A new Njoku deal surely wouldn't match his expiring $13,687,500 per-year contract. Considering the 29-year-old, nine-year veteran has expressed an interest in finishing his career in Cleveland, a hometown discount could be in order.\n            ",

LockeSNeckQuestionableThe Raiders are holding out O'Connell for this matchup, despite listing him as a full participant this week. Meanwhile, Johnson logged a full practice on Wednesday and both Pola-Mao and Butler were limited, so all three should have a shot at being active on Thursday. Denver ruled out receiver Marvin Mims Jr. as he continues to deal with a concussion. Mims was listed as a limited participant on both Tuesday and Wednesday in their estimated walkthrough sessions, so his return could be around the corner. Atlanta Falcons at Indianapolis Colts (-6.5) (in Berlin)The Falcons did not have edge rusher Leonard Floyd (hamstring), guard Chris Lindstrom (foot), offensive lineman Matthew Bergeron (ankle), or offensive lineman Storm Norton (foot) at practice on Wednesday. Corner Mike Hughes (neck), inside linebacker JD Bertrand (knee), and defensive lineman LaCale London (shoulder) were limited. Indy held out seven players to begin the week of practice: defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck), defensive end Samson Ebukam (knee), offensive tackle Matt Goncalves (personal), receiver Anthony Gould (knee), defensive end Tyquan Lewis (groin), corner Kenny Moore II (Achilles), and receiver Michael Pittman Jr. (glute). The Colts also listed newly acquired corner Sauce Gardner (concussion) as a full participant. Baltimore Ravens (-4) at Minnesota VikingsThe Ravens had no injuries to report on Wednesday as each player was a full participant at practice, the team announced. Minnesota did not have safety Theo Jackson (concussion), running back Aaron Jones (shoulder, toe), corner Jeff Okudah (concussion), tight end Josh Oliver (foot), or safety Harrison Smith (rest) at practice on Wednesday. The team listed guard Will Fries (calf), fullback C.J. Ham (hand), safety Josh Metellus (foot), and defensive lineman Jalen Redmond (shin) as limited. Buffalo Bills (-9.5) at Miami DolphinsRunning back James Cook (ankle), defensive end Joey Bosa, and defensive end A.J. Epenesa (concussion) headlined the group of players not practicing for the Bills on Wednesday. Corner Taron Johnson (groin), defensive tackle DaQuan Jones (calf), and linebacker Shaq Thompson (hamstring) also didn't practice. Corner Christian Benford (groin), linebacker Terrel Bernard (ankle), and receiver Joshua Palmer (knee, ankle) were limited. Linebacker Chop Robinson (concussion), corner Rasul Douglas (foot, ankle), receiver Dee Eskridge (shoulder), and safety Ifeatu Melifonwu (thumb, foot) did not practice for Miami.

The Jaguars also held out tight end Hunter Long (hip, knee), corner Jourdan Lewis (neck), and offensive lineman Ezra Cleveland (knee, ankle). Receiver Dyami Brown (concussion), linebacker Dennis Gardeck (chest), defensive tackle Davon Hamilton (back), and linebacker Jack Kiser (quad) were limited. Coach DeMeco Ryans told reporters on Wednesday that C.J. Stroud is in concussion protocol and will not play this week. In his place, veteran Davis Mills will get the start. At practice, defensive ends Denico Autry (knee) and Will Anderson Jr. (quad) did not practice, along with running back Nick Chubb (foot), kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn (right quad), offensive lineman Tytus Howard (concussion), guard Ed Ingram (knee), and safety Jalen Pitre (concussion). Tight end Dalton Schultz (knee, shoulder) was limited. Cleveland Browns (-2.5) at New York JetsLinebacker Carson Schwesinger (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday, along with receiver Isaiah Bond (foot), defensive end Isaiah McGuire (illness), and offensive tackle Cam Robinson (illness).

Meanwhile, running back Alvin Kamara (ankle) and tight end Jack Stoll (ankle) were limited. Carolina held out running back Rico Dowdle from practice on Wednesday due to a quad injury. This comes after the back ran for 130 yards and two touchdowns in the upset win over Green Bay, so his status will certainly be worth monitoring. Meanwhile, guard Chandler Zavala (elbow) was also held out. Safety Lathan Ransom (illness) was limited.\nNew England Patriots at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-2.5)The Patriots were missing five players at the start of this week's practice: receiver Kayshon Boutte (hamstring), center Garrett Bradbury (hip), linebacker Christian Ellis (hip), defensive lineman Joshua Farmer (ankle), and running back Rhamondre Stevenson (toe. Receiver Chris Godwin Jr. and running back Bucky Irving (foot, shoulder) did not practice on Wednesday, nor did outside linebackers Haason Reddick (ankle, knee) and Markees Watts (hand).

Running backs D'Andre Swift, Kyle Monangai (ankle), and Roschon Johnson (back) were limited, along with tight end Cole Kmet (concussion). Arizona Cardinals at Seattle Seahawks (-6)After naming Jacoby Brissett the starter for Week 10, the Cardinals placed Kyler Murray (foot) on injured reserve. That means he'll miss a minimum of four games. Corner Max Melton (concussion) and linebacker Mack Wilson Sr. (ribs) did not participate at practice. Safety Budda Baker (hamstring), corner Kei'Trel Clark (ankle), safety Kitan Crawford (hamstring), offensive lineman Will Hernandez (knee), corner Will Johnson (back, hip), receiver Zay Jones (knee), linebacker B.J.

That was Tyler Shough's first NFL start, and it was disappointing to see the lack of production for Olave.But things have changed for the Saints since that game with Rashid Shaheed getting traded to Seattle. Now, Olave is the clear top target in this offense, and he should rebound in Week 10 at Carolina.Prior to Week 9, Olave had scored at least 14 PPR points in three games in a row, with most of that production coming from Spencer Rattler. But I'm hopeful Olave will perform better with Shough now that Shaheed is gone.The Panthers have struggled with No. 1 receivers this season as Stefon Diggs, Jaylen Waddle, George Pickens, Khalil Shakir and Romeo Doubs all scored at least 16.1 PPR points in the past six games. And Olave has scored at least 12.8 PPR points in three of his past five games with Carolina.\nOlave is worth starting in the majority of leagues in Week 10, but he should be considered a low-end No. 2 Fantasy receiver. There's room for him to succeed with Shaheed gone, but he needs help from Shough. And I expect that to happen in this game against the Panthers.\nWRs to Start\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Denver\n                    \n                                            • #14\n                                            \n                                            Age: 30\n                                                                        • Experience: 8 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LV\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DEN -8.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                28th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                14.3\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                14th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    38\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    62\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    566\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Sutton caught a 30-yard touchdown in Week 9 at Houston, but that was his only reception on six targets. He's scored 10.7 PPR points or less in three of his past four games heading into Week 10 against Las Vegas, but he should break out of his slump in this matchup. He has at least 13 PPR points in three of his past five meetings with the Raiders, who are No. 5 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and a receiver has scored at least 17 PPR points against Las Vegas in each of the past two games. Sutton has top-10 upside in all leagues in this matchup, and I also like Troy Franklin as a sleeper. He has 28 targets in his past three games and has scored at least 12.9 PPR points in two games over that span.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #15\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        NYG\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -4.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                26th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                12.2\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                22nd\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    31\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    59\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    473\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Odunze had no Fantasy points in Week 9 at Cincinnati on just three targets, and he comes into Week 10 against the Giants having scored 5.2 PPR points or less in three of his past four games. But he should snap out of his slump against the Giants, who are No. 7 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. For the season, 12 receivers have scored at least 14 PPR points against the Giants, with eight touchdowns. Caleb Williams should lean on Odunze in this matchup, and he's worth starting in all leagues despite last week's disappointing performance.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        GB\n                    \n                         \n                        Green Bay\n                    \n                                            • #87\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        PHI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -2.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10.1\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    34\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    52\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    441\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Doubs should be the No. 1 receiving option for the Packers in Week 10 with Tucker Kraft (ACL) out, and Doubs has at least eight targets in four of his past five games. He scored at least 13.2 PPR points in three of those outings, including last week against Carolina when he had seven catches for 91 yards on 10 targets in the game Kraft was injured. There have been 10 receivers with at least seven targets against the Eagles this season, and eight of them have scored at least 12.9 PPR points. I like Doubs as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

He has at least seven targets in four of his past five outings, and he should continue to see a significant amount of targets from Jaxson Dart in this matchup against the Bears. Chicago is No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and 10 receivers have scored at least 13.6 PPR points against the Bears this season, including three from the Bengals in Week 9. I like Robinson as a No. 2 Fantasy receiver in this matchup, and Darius Slayton is a sleeper. He just had 11.2 PPR points against the 49ers in Week 9 and should be able to build on that performance against Chicago.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAC\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

This week, Johnston has a dream matchup against the Steelers, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. There have been 10 receivers who have scored at least 15.4 PPR points against Pittsburgh, including three last week from the Colts. Ladd McConkey, Johnston and Keenan Allen, in that order, all should do well in this matchup, and Johnston should have the chance to make some big plays down the field against this secondary.\n

McCarthy in Week 9 at Detroit, and it didn't go well. He only had two catches for 48 yards on four targets, and this was the first game all season where Addison was held to single digits in Fantasy points. Addison has now had just four targets in each of his past two games, and the volume might not be there for him since McCarthy has yet to attempt more than 25 passes in any of his three starts this season. I would only start Addison in three-receiver leagues against the Ravens, who have not allowed a receiver to score a touchdown since Week 5.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        WAS\n                    \n                         \n                        Washington\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 29\n                                                                        • Experience: 7 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DET\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DET -8\n                                    O/U 49.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                23rd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                12\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                29th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    42\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    55\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    367\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Samuel comes into Week 10 against the Lions in a three-game slump, and it's tough to trust him as a starter in the majority of leagues. In his past three games against Chicago, Kansas City and Seattle, Samuel has combined for just 12 catches for 67 yards and no touchdowns on 17 targets, and he scored 9.4 PPR points or less in each outing. Marcus Mariota is starting for the injured Jayden Daniels, and Samuel has scored 4.9 PPR points or less in two of three previous starts with Mariota this season. I would only start Samuel in three-receiver leagues in Week 10.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        JAC\n                    \n                         \n                        Jacksonville\n                    \n                                            • #16\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 7 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        HOU\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    JAC -1\n                                    O/U 37.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                3rd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                7.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                39th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    33\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    49\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    352\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Meyers was traded from Las Vegas to Jacksonville on Tuesday, and he might benefit this week if Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) is out, along with Travis Hunter (knee) being on injured reserve. But that also means more attention from the Texans secondary, and Houston is No. 2 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Keep in mind that Meyers was having a down season before the trade with no touchdowns and five games in a row with 9.3 PPR points or less prior to Week 10. And the Texans have only allowed six receivers all season to score at least 10 PPR points, with only two touchdowns since Week 2. Meyers is only worth using in deep, three-receiver leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LV\n                    \n                         \n                        Las Vegas\n                    \n                                            • #1\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DEN -8.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                41st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    32\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    43\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    427\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    12.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Tucker is now the No. 1 receiver for the Raiders with Jakobi Meyers getting traded to Jacksonville, but I don't want to start Tucker in Week 10 against the Broncos. Even though Patrick Surtain II (pectoral) isn't expected to play, Denver is still a tough matchup, and the Broncos have allowed just two touchdowns to opposing receivers all season. I'm excited for Tucker's outlook for the rest of the year with Meyers gone, but Tucker is not worth trusting in most leagues in Week 10.\n            \n            \n\nBust AlertSleepers (Start/Sit)\n

Metcalf has scored 8.0 PPR points or less in two of his past three games, and he's coming off his worst outing of the season in Week 9 against the Colts with two catches for 6 yards on four targets. He'll perform better than that in Week 10 at the Chargers, but it might not be a great performance overall. The Chargers are No. 3 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and they have only allowed four touchdowns to the position this year. That's important since Metcalf has scored double digits in PPR only once this season without finding the end zone. I would only start Metcalf in three-receiver leagues in Week 10.\n            \n            \n\n            \n    \n\n        \n\n    \n            \n    \n            \n\n                    \n

The Cardinals were the underdog in each of their two MAC home victories, also defeating Akron, 42-28, on Oct. 18. Meanwhile, Kent State has been one of the worst road teams in the nation, losing all four of their road games by at least 35 points. The first three are more understandable, coming against Oklahoma, Texas Tech and Florida State, but Kent State also lost to Toledo, 45-10, on Oct. 18 in MAC play.

Still, even with the six losses, only two of them have come by more than 14 points. They are 1-3 in MAC games, and only one of those defeats came by more than 14 points. Toledo defeated Kent State, 45-10, in its most recent MAC contest, which has made the Rockets a larger favorite than maybe many would have expected when first seeing this matchup, but the Rockets are just 4-4 overall and 2-2 in conference play this season. Northern Illinois has covered this number in three of its last four meetings and 15 of its last 17 matchups.

The Wizards are once again 29th in scoring defense this year, but they are allowing 127 ppg over their 1-6 start. Washington has allowed at least 119 points in six of seven games this year. The Celtics are still adjusting to playing without Jayson Tatum (Achilles), but Jaylen Brown had 36 points against the Jazz on Monday and is tied for 10th in the league at 26.8 ppg this season.

The legendary forward has already etched his name in history after passing Wayne Gretzky atop the league's all-time goals list last season when he reached 895 and now he is nearing a milestone nobody has ever reached: 900 goals.\"Ovi\" entered the season three shy of the 900-goal mark, but now he's just one shy of reaching heights never seen by a goal scorer.

    "body": "\n        When Estevao opened the scoring for Chelsea only 16 minutes into their Champions League match against Qarabag on Wednesday, it seemed like they'd roll to victory in Azerbaijan, but instead they found out why Qarabag are one of the surprise outfits of this UCL campaign in a 2-2 draw. After Hato conceded a penalty via a handball in the box, Qarabag were able to go into the half with a 2-1 lead, and while Alejandro Garnacho did pull a goal back to level things, the Blues couldn't find a winner in a game that was a grind from start to finish.With almost a 3,000 mile journey to Baku, Enzo Maresca had to rotate his squad to cope with the travel, but it only took eight minutes for his carefully laid plans to be destroyed when midfielder Romero Lavia left the match with an injury and was replaced by Moises Caidedo. At half, another shift was made was Tyrique George was limited to only 13 touches in the first half and had to be pulled in favor of Liam Delap, who returned from a hamstring injury.\nThe changes did work as the Blues were able to turn a loss into a draw but being outperformed by Qarabag isn't what they had in mind. The Blues held most of the possession and took 16 shots while only generating 1.08 expected goals. Meanwhile, Qarabag generated an xG of 1.65 on only nine shots. Even taking out their penalty, that efficiency shows what Chelsea are missing in their striker merry-go-round. The Blues have been forced into making changes due to suspensions and injuries, but depite their hot starts to life at Chelsea, the duo have combined for three goals and three assists in all competitions.\nWingers like Estevao and Pedro Neto have done what they can, but without Cole Palmer, the attack's struggles put too much pressure on Reece James and the defense. Qarabag essentially out-did Chelsea at their own game, turning counters into goals, and there was nothing that Robert Sanchez could do about it. Many of these issues are resolved when Palmer returns to the center of the pitch, but when the Blues have aspirations of finishing in the top four of the Premier League while also balancing Champions League, they need to perform in these moments when their stars aren't available.\nit's what the top teams do, and so far, Chelsea haven't bridged the gap from being a good team to becoming a great one. They're still on the right track to advance to the knockouts of this tournament, but while losing to Bayern Munich showed how far they have to go, this game showed where depth players need to improve to make the Blues a more consistent side.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        More people watched Game 7 of the 2025 World Series than any game since the 1991 Fall Classic. The game drew 51 million viewers across the United States, Canada and Japan. Overall, the entire World Series was the most watched globally since 1992 and it was a 19% increase over last season. That same Game 7 had roughly double the number of viewers in the United States as Game 7 of the NBA Finals. In this day and age and in a non-football sport, that's staggering.Yes, NFL and college football people who love to scream at the other sports about ratings, we get it. You're the true monster of American sports. You dominate us. We get it. I'm a big football fan, too, so I have no problem with more people watching it. There's room to celebrate victories in other sports as well. We should still acknowledge that the 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays was a major success for Major League Baseball.Unless you're a network executive, you shouldn't care about TV ratings. But these numbers tell us more about baseball than just ratings.\nOne of the loudest arguments against MLB right now revolves around salary. The Dodgers, the first repeat champions since 2000, had the top payroll in baseball, which means the suggestion is that if a team just \"buys\" a championship -- it's never even remotely that simple, by the way -- then people will start to tune out the sport. In that narrative, it's imperative for the league to get control of spending in order to bring back all the fans who quit watching. You'll also hear nonsense like, \"it's just the same teams every year!\" The Blue Jays hadn't been to the World Series since 1993. Last year's runners-up, the Yankees, hadn't been since 2009. The 2023 World Series pitted a team that won its first-ever World Series against a team that hadn't been there since 2001. So that argument doesn't fly. Now we're back to the whole \"no one pays attention because it's not fair without a salary cap\" argument.\nAnd yet, the numbers speak for themselves, don't they? Not only did the Dodgers just win the World Series with the top payroll in baseball, but they are the repeat champions and 51 million people watched them win Game 7. Were they watching to root against the Dodgers? Possibly. Does it matter why people watched or does it only matter that they watched?Again, the entire structure of this pro-salary cap argument is that the product is bad without it and people will stop watching because they're bored. They want to see underdogs, not big spenders. And yet more people tuned in to watch the Dodgers and Blue Jays (who, by the way, had the fifth-highest payroll in MLB) than had in more than three decades.The more people watch, the more the league makes money. This is a business. From this perspective, the league just had its most successful World Series since at least 1992. Given the current media environment with so many other viewing options on different mediums, you could probably make the argument it was the most fruitful World Series, I don't know, ever? \nI do know this much: the whole \"MLB needs a salary cap to keep people interested\" argument really collapses on itself when you see these kinds of numbers. Put it this way, do you really think a Brewers-Rays World Series would've done this kind of business? It sets up an interesting discussion point for the owner side in front of the next CBA, coming next offseason. We know the players are very averse to a salary cap and the owners want one. I agree that it's unfair to have such a gigantic payroll disparity between the Dodgers and the lower third or so of those other teams. I just think the solution is for the lower-tier teams to spend more. There's already revenue sharing. The richest teams are giving money to the \"poor\" teams (psst: None of them are poor). \nWith the league as a whole seeing what kind of interest this World Series generated compared to a year like 2023, it'll be interesting to see how things unfold on the ownership side. We know they love making money. Will they really want to try and mess with what just happened in the name of satisfying some of the cheapest owners? Or will they tell the cheapest owners to start spending the money they get from the deep-pocketed ones?Regardless, the argument that \"baseball is dying\" or \"no one watches\" due to lack of a salary cap was just exploded like both Death Stars. There are 51 million reasons to get a new argument.\n            ",

New England extended its win streak to six games on Sunday versus Atlanta, but the Pats failed to cover for the first time during the streak. Meanwhile, the Bucs covered their last time out and have the rest advantage in coming off a Week 9 bye. That advantage for Tampa -- and disadvantage for New England -- can't be overlooked as the Pats are 4-12-1 ATS over their last 17 with a rest disadvantage, which dates back to the Tom Brady era.With that ATS loss to the Falcons, New England is only 3-9-1 ATS versus NFC opponents since 2023. On the field, the Patriots have the NFL's worst redzone defense this season, and Drake Maye has been sloppy with the ball as of late. He has three fumbles (one lost) and two interceptions over his last two games, which Tampa can capitalize on as it boasts the fourth-best turnover differential (+7) in the league. With the model projecting the Bucs to win the turnover battle on Sunday, and racking up twice as many defensive sacks, Tampa prevails versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 10 NFL predictions: 49ers (+4.5, 49.5) cover versus the Rams in well over 50% of simulations. San Francisco is 8-4 versus the spread over these teams last dozen meetings, including outright winning as 8.5-point underdogs in Week 5. The Niners are coming off a double-digit road victory over the Giants, with Mac Jones under center, and it doesn't matter who is at quarterback for the team as long as Christian McCaffrey is at running back. He set an NFL record on Sunday with his 16th game with both a rushing and receiving touchdown as he leads the NFL with 1,222 yards from scrimmage.Los Angeles has only truly been tested in a road environment just once this season, and it lost at Philadelphia. The team's other true road games include facing the Ravens without Lamar Jackson, and facing the lowly Titans. While L.A. has impressive metrics on both sides of the ball, one can't overlook its subpar special teams. The Rams are last in field goal percentage, third-worst in extra point percentage and just seven teams give up more yards per punt return. With San Fran having the edge on the margins, it covers, and the model also says the Under hits over 60% of the time in an A-rated total pick. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 10 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 10 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that cover in 60% of simulations or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

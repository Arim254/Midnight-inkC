The Americans rolled to a 6-2 win over Slovakia in the semifinals to set up gold medal matchup against rival Canada.The Americans dictated play from the jump, and Dylan Larkin set the tone with an early goal to give his team the lead. Larkin took a pass from defenseman Zach Werenski and wired a shot past Slovakian goalie Samuel Hlavaj. That was an indicator of what was to come.\nSpeaking of Werenski, that assist on Larkin's goal was the first of three he registered against the Slovakians, bringing his Olympic point total to five.Jack Hughes has been brilliant for Team USA throughout the tournament, and he was at his very best on Friday. Hughes notched a pair of goals -- both in a dominant second period effort -- and the first one was of the highlight reel variety. Hughes moved in from the point, deked Tomas Tatar to the ice and lifted a shot over the shoulder of Hlavaj.The U.S. led 5-0 at the second intermission and parked the bus in the final 20 minutes. Connor Hellebuyck did allow a couple of late goals to Juraj Slafkovsky and Pavol Regenda, the first time he's allowed more than one in a start in Milan, but those only served to make the score a bit more respectable.Team USA will now get its shot to dethrone Canada in a rivalry game with a gold medal on the line. That game will begin at 8:10 a.m. ET on Sunday morning.\nU.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3Sunday, Feb. 15: USA 5, Germany 1QuarterfinalWednesday, Feb. 18: USA 2, Sweden 1 (OT)Semifinal\nFriday, Feb. 20: USA 6, Slovakia 2Gold medal gameUSA vs. Canada | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | NBC\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar was denied a preliminary injunction in his eligibility lawsuit against the NCAA by a Knoxville judge, per multiple reports. That denial figures to be a decisive blow to his efforts at playing for the Volunteers in 2026, and serves as a big win for the NCAA which has been on the wrong side of a number of eligibility cases recently. Aguilar hoped to follow in the footsteps of Ole Miss star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who received his own temporary injunction from a Mississippi-based chancery court earlier in February. However, Aguilar's case is different than Chambliss', who argued successfully he should gain another year of eligibility due to a health condition he dealt with in 2022. Aguilar's attorneys tried to argue that his junior college years should not count against his NCAA eligibility. Aguilar spent two years at the City College of San Francisco (2019-20) and two years Diablo Valley College (2021-22) before signing with Appalachian State ahead of the 2023 season. That was not a sufficient enough argument to win him the same type of temporary injunction against the NCAA that will allow Chambliss to play another year in Oxford, and barring an unforeseen reversal via a quick appeal, Aguilar will not be back in a Volunteer uniform this fall. \nWhat Aguilar's departure means for Tennessee's QB situationWithout Aguilar under center, Tennessee must replace one of the most productive quarterbacks in the SEC from a season ago. Aguilar completed 67.3% percent of his passes for 3,565 yards and 24 touchdowns in 2025 and was going to be one of the top returning QBs in the SEC in 2026. Because Tennessee didn't land one of the top quarterbacks in the transfer portal -- but not for a lack of trying with Sam Leavitt before LSU locked him down --  the Volunteers will have to turn to unproven youngsters in what becomes one of the most interesting spring quarterback battles in the SEC. The Vols have redshirt freshman George MacIntyre, who played in just two games last season, and true freshman Faizon Brandon, a five-star prospect from the class of 2026 that ranked as the No. 3 player nationally and the No. 3 quarterback, as the most intriguing options, along with Colorado transfer Ryan Staub. MacIntyre threw a total of nine passes in those two appearances last year, completing seven of them for 69 yards. \nHis leg up on Brandon for the starting job won't be on-field experience, but the fact that he's had a year to absorb more of coach Josh Heupel's system. For a Tennessee team hoping to threaten for a College Football Playoff berth in 2026, losing Aguilar puts a tremendous amount of pressure on their young quarterback room to get up to speed quickly -- and on Heupel to make the correct choice between two unproven freshmen. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Minnesota's already slim postseason hopes were dealt a significant blow Friday. Twins right-hander Pablo López will have Tommy John surgery next Wednesday, reports The Athletic. This will be López's second Tommy John surgery, which comes with a 14-18 month rehab. His season is over and he will likely miss the start of next season as well.\"Obviously  it's really disappointing news,\" GM Jeremy Zoll told MLB.com after tests revealed a UCL tear in López's elbow earlier this week. \"You  really feel for Pablo. As everyone knows, his work ethic, how much he  cares about his body, his preparation is second to none. Huge blow for  him. He was understandably quite disappointed.\" López, 30 next month, had his first Tommy John surgery as a minor leaguer in 2014. Hamstring, shoulder, and forearm injuries limited him to only 14 starts last season, but, prior to that, López was one of the game's most reliable workhorses. He made 32 starts every year from 2022-24 and ranked seventh with 559 ⅓ innings those three years. \nThis is Year 3 of the four-year, $73.5 million extension López signed in April 2023. He is owed $21.5 million in both 2026 and 2027. That salary, plus an injury that will wipe out his entire 2026 and at least part of his 2027, makes López untradeable. At least for the next 18 months or so. Things could change if he looks sharp when he returns next year. \nFanGraphs projections put Minnesota's postseason odds at 26.0% following the López injury. They were considered an unlikely contender coming into the spring with him. Losing him is devastating. Here is the club's updated rotation depth chart: RHP Joe RyanRHP Pablo López (will miss 2026 with Tommy John surgery)RHP Bailey OberRHP Simeon Woods RichardsonRHP Taj BradleyRHP Zebby MatthewsRHP Mick AbelRHP David FestaThere is plenty of talent and upside there, though the lineup is unimposing and the bullpen is short on proven late-inning options. If the Twins contend this year, it will be because their rotation lives up to its potential and props up the offense and bullpen, but López's injury now takes away an important part of that rotation. A major blow, it is. No doubt. Ryan has been in trade rumors for more than a year now. If the Twins fall out of the race, he would become the top starter available at the trade deadline. He has two years of control remaining and, as López's injury shows, two years of control can be reduced to half-a-season really quickly. The longer the Twins hold onto Ryan, the more injury risk they assume. \nMinnesota went 70-92 last season and sold hard at midseason, moving 10 members of their active 26-man roster in the days leading up to the trade deadline. López was on the injured list at the time and not a real candidate to be traded. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A middleweight title shot could be at stake for the winner of Saturday's UFC Fight Night main event in Houston. Former UFC champion Sean Strickland looks to bounce back against red-hot contender Anthony Hernandez.Strickland (29-7) has a new path to the middleweight title after Khamzat Chiamev became champion. Strickland was unlikely to get a third crack at Dricus du Plessis after two failed attempts. But Chimaev vs. Strickland is a fresh matchup. Between Strickland's No. 3 middleweight ranking and name value, it's feasible he could sneak ahead of the more deserving title challenger Nassourdine Imavov. Strickland has to beat Hernandez before those conversations can start. Oddsmakers think that's a tall task; Strickland disagrees.\"He has been steamrolling guys that I could f---ing write a clinic on,\"  Strickland told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell before the fight. \"So, no, he's not [on my level].\"Sign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nHernandez (15-2, 1 NC) is ready for his breakout moment after taking the long road through the division. \"Fluffy\" was won eight consecutive fights with six finishes. He's days away from potentially having the third longest middleweight win streak in UFC history. Beating Strickland would be the biggest accomplishment of his career, and puts him on par with Imavov as the most deserving middleweight title challenger. In fact, \"Fluffy\" would arguably have a better case than Imavov, boasting a longer win streak and just as many wins over former UFC champs.\"I think if you beat a former champ, that really makes a statement  because everybody is really good here,\" Hernandez said. \"Someone who has already done that  shit, you go out there and take him out? You are sitting in a really  good place.\"  Bet UFC Fight Night at DraftKings and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nUFC Fight Night also features two perennial contenders looking to protect their places in the pecking order. Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. \"I didn't have the energy for anything. I didn't prepare right. The weight cuts were terrible,\" Neal told CBS sports this week. \"There was a point before all that shit happen, I'd run for an hour at a seven mile pace. I'm knocking out eight point six miles in an hour. I'm trying to get back to the old me.\"\"I had trauma to my eyes,\" Ige said. \"My mindset going into that fight was, 'I don't know if I'll ever fight again.' I didn't know what I was dealing with. I didn't want a way out of the fight. I knew if I went to a doctor, they would tell me not to fight. That's my ego and my pride. I've battled with that for a long time. I probably should've addressed it, but I didn't... It's something I've always battled, but I'm getting better with it. I have a better relationship with myself and my thoughts. Things are night and day different.\" \nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassAnthony Hernandez -278Sean Strickland +225MiddleweightGeoff Neal -218Uros Medic +180WelterweightMelquizael Costa -218Dan Ige +180FeatherweightAnte Delija -142Sergehi Spivac +120HeavyweightJacobe Smith -310Josiah Harrell +250WelterweightMichel Pereira -155Zach Reese +130MiddleweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Feb. 21 | Start time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Toyota Center -- HoustonStream: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionSean Strickland vs. Anthony Hernandez: I'm surprised with how far apart the odds are. Hernandez is taking a meaningful step up in competition against arguably the division's most frustrating defensive fighter. Strickland has elite experience and is uniquely equipped to limit his opponent's offense. Hernandez also has serious gaps in his defensive striking that Strickland can exploit. That being said, I'll side with the rising tide. Hernandez is a menace when he has grappling control and half guard on the ground. Strickland did a fantastic job stuffing du Plessis' takedowns and getting off the mat quickly. \"Fluffy\" lacks DDP's physicality, but makes up for it with tenacious chain wrestling and far better top control. Hernandez will have a tough time taking Strickland down. When he does, he'll make the most of it.

    "body": "\n        We're just a few weeks removed from the 2025 season coming to a close. While the Seattle Seahawks are still basking in the glory of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LX, the rest of the NFL is preparing to knock them off the pedestal or at least become more competitive in 2026. For some organizations, that includes overhauling or continuing the search for their franchise quarterback, while others are simply building around the signal-caller they have. Then, there's another group. It's the collection of teams that aren't quite thrilled with the quarterback they have in place, but are not totally at the stage of hitting the eject button either. That uneasy middle ground regarding the most important position in the sport is hardly the place any team wants to be, but it's the reality for a handful entering 2026. That creates a ton of pressure on those quarterbacks to put everyone's concerns to rest with a strong season, thus planting their flag as a franchise centerpiece. If not, some hard decisions will then need to be made.Below, we'll highlight five quarterbacks who are currently on the hot seat, albeit with the start of the 2026 campaign still months away.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. C.J. Stroud\nA decision on Stroud's future in Houston could come as early as this offseason, as the former No. 2 overall pick is now extension eligible. At the very least, the Texans will almost certainly pick up his fifth-year option, but Stroud hasn't instilled much confidence in recent seasons. The Ohio State product burst onto the scene with one of the better rookie seasons in recent memory in 2023, but he hasn't followed that up with equal or ascending production. In fact, he's regressed on a couple of fronts. \nC.J. Stroud's career as a starter20232024-2025Passing yards per game273.9218.3TD-INT23-539-20Passer rating100.889.6Over the last two seasons, Stroud's completion percentage is worse than Kirk Cousins over that stretch, his yards per attempt are below Geno Smith's, and his passer rating is below Kyler Murray's. Stroud should be heads and shoulders above those quarterbacks as he establishes himself as one of the brightest young players at the position. Instead, he's going in the other direction. And let's not forget the jarring four-interception game in the divisional round against New England. This is hardly the trajectory a team wants to see when considering making him one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league on a contract that'll likely pay him somewhere in the range of $55 million per season. It also makes one wonder if Houston will hold off on giving Stroud any sort of extension this offseason and merely pick up the fifth-year option. If that happens, Stroud will be put further under the microscope in 2026 with the Texans determining if he's truly worth giving a mammoth contract to. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Bryce Young\nYoung is in a somewhat similar position to Stroud as the Panthers are now having to consider giving him the fifth-year option (which they are expected to do), along with potentially inking him to an extension. It's been a topsy-turvy career for Young thus far after being the No. 1 overall pick in 2023. The Alabama product was benched momentarily, but he did just enjoy a solid bounce-back season in 2025. He notched career highs in passing touchdowns, completion percentage, and passing yards per game, while helping Carolina to an NFC South championship. Young also played well in his playoff debut, albeit in a losing effort to the Rams. With that in mind, there should be optimism surrounding Young going into 2026, but he hasn't firmly established himself just yet. As encouraging as 2025 was, Young still completed just 63.6% of his passes and averaged 188.2 passing yards per game for an 87.8 passer rating. That's good, but not exactly great production. If he plateaus or regresses next season, the Panthers will still have major questions surrounding him as their long-term option.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Michael Penix Jr.\nPenix may be given the benefit of the doubt in 2026 because he's recovering from a torn ACL, but the former Washington quarterback hasn't impressed since Atlanta selected him with the eighth overall pick in 2024. He's 4-8 as the starter (3-6 in 2025), and is completing less than 60% of his passes with a mere 85.8 passer rating for his career. Despite having some of the top weaponry in the league in running back Bijan Robinson and wideout Drake London, the Falcons offense under Penix has looked clunky. With a new regime coming aboard with Matt Ryan being hired as the President of Football, Ian Cunningham being added as GM, and Kevin Stefanski installed as head coach, Penix could be on shaky ground. After all, none of those figures drafted him, so they are not as invested in him as the previous decision-makers were. There are also durability questions as he's dealt with several serious injuries dating back to college. YearInjuryGames missed2018Right torn ACL42019Right fractured collarbone42020Right torn ACL32021Left A/C joint separation72025Left torn ACL8When you factor in that injury history alongside the uninspiring play when he has been on the field, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Falcons bring in some competition this offseason, whether that's keeping Kirk Cousins in-house or adding another QB into the mix. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. J.J. McCarthy\nThe Vikings bungled their quarterback situation, and it may have cost them their Super Bowl window. They decided to ride with McCarthy and allow Sam Darnold to depart in free agency last offseason after a 14-3 regular season in 2024. Darnold went on to win a Super Bowl with Seattle, while McCarthy has largely struggled as the starter. That decision was seemingly a driving force in Minnesota firing GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. A new GM won't have the same investment in McCarthy as Adofo-Mensah did, so the former first-round pick is truly at a crossroads in 2026. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if the Vikings, under interim GM Rob Brzezinski, bring in some competition this offseason. Depending on who comes aboard (Mac Jones, Tua Tagovailoa, etc.), McCarthy's job could vanish before we even get to Week 1. In 2025, McCarthy was 6-4 as the starter, completed just 57.6% of his passes, and had more interceptions (12) than touchdowns (11). J.J. McCarthy in 2025StatsNFL rankCompletion percentage58%LastTD-INT11-12Last Passer rating72.6LastHowever, the Michigan product did flash a little bit down the stretch, owning a 4-0 record over his final four games in 2025 with seven total touchdowns and just three turnovers. Is that the tide turning in a positive direction? That remains to be seen, but the Vikings aren't exactly acting like it is as they seem open to an upgrade if one is realistically available to them. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Shedeur Sanders\nSanders ended the 2025 season as Cleveland's starting quarterback, but he has hardly established himself as the set-and-forget figure under center for the organization. Despite the fanfare, the Colorado quarterback wasn't particularly impressive when given his opportunity.

When asked about it during his introductory press conference, Monken told reporters that it's \"still to be determined.\" There's no clear-cut prospect Cleveland could take with the No. 6 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft, but the team could (and likely will) look to bring in a veteran to compete for the starting job this offseason. That sets up Sanders to be fighting for his job the moment training camp begins later this summer. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Juventus, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments. This week's Serie A slate features some interesting matchups, such as the game between Como and Juventus on Saturday in Turin, but it is injury news that is all the talk heading into the weekend. Here's what to know:Lautaro Martinez injuredInter will have to react after the disappointing 3-1 defeat against Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League as the Nerazzurri are currently leading the Serie A standings with a seven-point margin on AC Milan, which drew 1-1 at San Siro against Como on Wednesday. Cristian Chivu's side will have to deal with the injury of Lautaro Martinez, who was replaced in the second half of the Champions League first leg playoffs. The Argentinian captain underwent a medical examinations that \"revealed a strain to the soleus muscle in his left calf,\" and the player will be reevaluated in the coming weeks, but he's expected to miss at least two weeks of action and will likely miss the key fixture against AC Milan on March 8. This is why the upcoming two Serie A games and the Champions League return leg against Bodo/Glimt will be even more important for Chivu and his team, as the Nerazzurri will need to continue performing even without their best striker on the roster. Players such as Marcus Thuram, Yann Bonny and the young Italian talent Francesco Pio Esposito will be called to make the difference against Lecce on Saturday, the first match Lautaro will definitely miss. How to watch Lecce vs. Inter, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Via del Mare -- Lecce Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Lecce +669; Draw +318; Inter -223How to watch Serie A Matchday 26All times U.S./Eastern. \nFriday, Feb. 20Sassuolo vs. Hellas Verona, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Saturday, Feb. 21Juventus vs. Como, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Lecce vs. Inter, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, Feb. 22Genoa vs. Torino, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Atalanta vs. Napoli, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)AC Milan vs. Parma, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Cremonese, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, Feb. 23Fiorentina vs. Pisa, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Udinese vs. Bologna, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Toronto FC have finally worked out an agreement to bring American striker Josh Sargent to MLS from Norwich City, according to The Athletic. It has been a roundabout process, but the fee is around $22 million, which is one of the highest in MLS history and would mark a record purchase for Toronto. Despite being from Missouri, Sargent has never played in MLS, but the move back to North America comes at a time when the 25-year-old is settling down to raise his family. It was a strange departure from Norwich City as Sargent reportedly declared himself unavailable for an FA Cup tie in January via a text to manager Philippe Clement, and he has been banished to the U-23's since. In 156 appearances for Norwich City, Sargent has scored 56 goals between the Premier League and the Championship, but despite reported interest from Wolfsburg during the summer, according to The Athletic, the move to North America is what made the most sense.Sargent has fallen down the pecking order for the United States men's national team as he looks to make the squad for a second consecutive World Cup. He hasn't been called into camp since September of 2025, when he started against South Korea before being benched against Japan, which started the USMNT's current five-match unbeaten streak. Manager Mauricio Pochettino has stated multiple times that the door isn't closed for players, so if Sargent comes into Toronto and starts scoring, there could be a window to make the World Cup, but with Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, and Folarin Balogun all performing well at their clubs and Ricardo Pepi coming back from injury, it will be hard to break back into the USMNT rotation.The first priority is getting back to fitness, as Sargent hasn't played first-team soccer since January, but coming to a Toronto team that also hasn't played competitive matches since the MLS season ended in October of 2025, Sargent won't be that far off the pace of his teammates. Toronto finished 12th in the Eastern Conference last season, missing the playoffs and averaging less than a point per game while also being one of the lowest scoring attacks in the league. Sargent will be alongside midfielder Djordje Mihailovic as the key players in Toronto's attack this season in a team that has high expectations despite rebuilding.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Sargent will bring a strong presence to the team, but he's been someone who is at their best when others are creating chances for him, which is where Mihailovic comes in. If the duo can get things going together, there's no reason why Toronto won't win some games this season, as an improvement is needed. Toronto will open their season on Saturday night, facing FC Dallas.\n            ",

He'll rematch Finn Balor at Elimination Chamber, the last major stop before WrestleMania. If he leaves Chicago with his champion status intact, Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns awaits him in Las Vegas.Plus, Punk's wife, AJ Lee, returns for her first singles match in over a decade when she takes on Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental championship.Elimination Chamber's two titular matches will also take place. The superstars who emerge from their respective steel structures victorious will earn world title matches at WrestleMania. Randy Orton, LA Knight and Cody Rhodes are among those who've qualified for a shot at the undisputed WWE title. Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka will compete with two other women for a shot at one of the two women's world titles as Royal Rumble winner Liv Morgan has still yet to make her decision on who she will face.\nTake a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come.

Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.Elimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. TBA: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw. Williams earned the penultimate spot by beating Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest.\nWomen's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. TBA: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie. James snuck a pinfall over Charlotte Flair in their match with Nia Jax.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsUndisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Jacob Fatu: WWE subverted expectations by booking Rhodes and Fatu in the same Elimination Chamber qualifying match. All signs pointed to an eventual triple threat match between them and McIntyre. Rhodes is still the favorite to challenge McIntyre at WrestleMania. Maybe Fatu loses his qualifying match and earns a separate title shot against McIntyre. It seems odd to reward Fatu with a title opportunity if he loses his upcoming qualifier match. Whatever direction WWE takes, expect Fatu to orbit McIntyre in the next few months.\n            ",

Mayweather announced that he will compete professionally in boxing after an exhibition fight with Mike Tyson in the spring.Mayweather will end his professional boxing retirement nine years after riding off into the sunset with a perfect 50-0 record. On Friday, Mayweather announced his plans to box professionally again after a planned exhibition bout with legendary heavyweight champion Tyson. Mayweather signed an exclusive deal with CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS for his upcoming exhibition and professional fights.\"I still have what it takes to set more  records in the sport of boxing,\" Mayweather said in a press release. \"From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my  next professional fight afterwards, no one will generate a bigger  gate, have a larger global  broadcast audience, and generate more money with each event than my  events.\"CSI Sports said they'd reveal details about event dates, broadcast information and the professional opponent for Mayweather's sanctioned return in the coming weeks. \nLast year, Mayweather and Tyson confirmed plans for an exhibition fight between them. The Ring recently reported the fight would take place on April 25 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; however, CSI Sports has not announced the date, location, or ruleset. Mayweather and Tyson are a combined 107 years old. Mayweather weighed in at 160.7 pounds for his last exhibition fight with John Gotti III. Tyson weighed 228.4 pounds for his exhibition bout with Jake Paul.Mayweather (50-0) retired from pro boxing after defeating former  two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor in 2017. Mayweather has taken  eight exhibition boxing bouts in the time since, most notably a first-round TKO against generational kickboxer Tenshin  Nasukawa and an eight-round affair in a non-scored bout with WWE superstar  Logan Paul. \nTyson (50-7, 2 NC) has boxed three times since retiring in 2004. Two of those were exhibitions: a non-scored bout with Corey Sanders in 2006 and a draw against Roy Jones Jr. in 2020. Last year, Tyson boxed in his first professional fight in two decades against Paul. Tyson lost a lifeless decision against Paul, 30 years his junior. The critically panned fight was a huge commercial success for Netflix.\n            \n",

Brady, widely regarded as the best NFL quarterback of all time, said he loved WWE but called it \"very cute.\" Paul, a part-time WWE superstar, argued that Brady was underestimating the athleticism required of pro wrestlers. Several high-profile WWE superstars and personalities reacted to Brady's statement when approached by Sports Illustrated. Some WWE talent brushed it off, while others went for Brady's throat.\"What's Tom Brady done? He's thrown a football across a field that was   caught by [Rob] Gronkowski,\" Hall of Famer Paul Heyman said. \"Gronkowski deserves the credit. [Bill] Belichick and his   girlfriend deserve the credit. But Tom Brady [gestures no].\"World heavyweight champion CM Punk had a more playful response than his longtime mentor and friend.\n\"What's wrong with cute?\" Punk said, looking directly into the camera. \"I'm cute, Tom.\" Former two-time NXT champion Oba Femi, an outdoor first-team All-USA selection with multiple shot put titles, challenged Brady to put himself through the rigorous pro wrestling training process. Undisputed WWE champion Drew McIntyre brushed off Brady's comments. He chalked up Brady's statement to a lack of understanding.\n\"I don't get annoyed,\" McIntyre said. \"It just comes from a place of ignorance.\"\n            \n",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA has already exceeded its overall medal tally, now at 27, and stands to add to both the overall count and possibly even the gold medal count. A win over Slovakia on Friday would assure the U.S. men's hockey team of some type of medal as it would advance to Sunday's final.On Thursday, figure skater Alysa Liu, 20, became the first American woman to take home a singles gold in 24 years and the U.S. women's hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third period deficit to a 2-1 overtime victory over rival Canada to reach the top of the podium for the first time in eight years. And speedskater Jordan Stolz added to his collection of two previous gold medals with a silver in the men's 1,500 meters.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Entering these Games, Norway had won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag.

    "body": "\n        From teetering on the edge of going out of business during the early 2000s to preparing to kick off a league's 31st season with some of the best players in the world, Major League Soccer has come a long way since the first ball was kicked between the San Jose Clash and D.C. United in 1996. What started as a mandate to bring first division soccer to the United States as a stipulation in landing the 1994 World Cup has become one of the top soccer leagues in the world, with no signs of slowing down. Beginning with only 10 teams in 1996, there will be 30 teams in action this weekend, as the league has grown in unimaginable ways. From multimillion-dollar facilities to the presence on national teams and World Cup rosters, and of course, Lionel Messi, the fingerprints of MLS will be all over the 2026 World Cup, taking place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico this summer.MLS commissioner Don Garber summed this up well during his state of the league address in December, saying, \"We'd love to say that [the World Cup is] the rocket fuel, but this jet has been running for 30 years, and it's going to run for another 30.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            In what will be the biggest World Cup in history, the 2026 tournament will expand to 48 teams for the first time, featuring at least four first-time qualifiers. It's expected to surpass records set by the 1994 World Cup, which is still the most attended in history. The 16 host cities are only the tip of the iceberg as well, with training facilities being picked out all around North America to ensure that national teams can have a true home away from home. But for any of this to happen, it goes back to the soccer builders in this country -- Lamar Hunt (of the Hunt family that owns the Kansas City Chiefs), Alan Rothenberg, Philip Anschutz, and so many more.Only a few may have expected things would advance so far when MLS started. However, for the first commissioner in league history, Doug Logan, this doesn't surprise him in the slightest.\n\"Yes, I did,\" Logan said when asked if he expected to see the best players in the world playing in MLS. \"People ask me that all the time. And the answer is yes. Part of the responsibility and the charge to the top leader in entities like this is to be able to have a vision of what could be and then tirelessly and ceaselessly keep the institution and the organization on that track. I realized where it was going to go. Not where it could go, but where it was going to go.\"I also realized after the first year or a year and a half that it was going to take longer and be more expensive to get there than my owners anticipated, And those were two realities for me, but if you're asking me, did I ever envision it getting to this, the answer is yes.\"NASL collapses, MLS risesEven with the league being founded in the wake of the North American Soccer League collapsing, that didn't stop investors like the Hunt family from buying into the potential that MLS could have. The NASL brought Pele to North America, and the New York Cosmos are still to this day one of the most recognizable American soccer brands, despite not having played a game since 2020 -- although that will change in March as they take the pitch to face Portland Hearts of Pine in New Jersey in USL League One.\nAt times, being able to keep that vision may have been easier said than done, especially during a period when Anschutz owned six of the league's 10 clubs, but the message remained the same. The people involved with the founding of MLS saw the potential in the league, and it was massive, but to come full circle with another World Cup on United States soil is where things are special in this moment of reflection. It may have taken longer than expected to get the World Cup back, but this is where the league can show how far it has come from the days of 10 clubs and franchises folding (Tampa Bay Mutiny, Miami Fusion, Chivas USA) and take advantage of the increased interest in soccer in America during it.MLS cities, facilities to have huge impactHost cities during the FIFA Club World Cup took notice when Boca Juniors fans descended on Miami, ES Tunis fans took over Times Square, and Brazilian fans marched from the Art Museum in Philadelphia, and it's an effect that will only be magnified during the World Cup. Kansas City will be central to this, with Algeria, Argentina, England, and the Netherlands all training in the Kansas City region.\"A World Cup puts the host country and all of the host cities on the global map. And of course, Kansas City is a big city, but from a global standpoint, it's probably not a very well-known city, with maybe the exception of its American football league team, which has garnered a little bit of global recognition over the last six or seven years,\" said Clark Hunt, chairman and CEO of the Hunt Sports Group, which owns the Chiefs and MLS club FC Dallas. \"But I really expect that Kansas City will become known globally because of its role in hosting World Cup games.\"\nMLS facilities have come a long way during this time, as the new Red Bull New York training facility in Whippany, N.J., that will open in March has a price tag higher than most early soccer-specific stadiums as over $120 million. That facility will host the Brazil national team during this summer's World Cup. Many of the league's newest facilities have garnered praise globally, with players noting the differences as well as teams and executives abroad taking note, but with national teams making the United States their home during the summer, it will be a true show of what these facilities have to offer. They were a large part of why the first expanded World Cup is taking place in the United States, and who knows, the facilities could lead to a few transfers into MLS following the World Cup. During a changing tide of American soccer, even those will be easier with the league looking to adopt a summer-to-spring schedule shift in 2027 to aling with the rest of the soccer world. It's one of many reasons why this World Cup feels like as much of an inflection point as it does a celebration of soccer, which was also the case in 1994, which brought the pressure of a new league, as there wasn't even a commissioner until November of 1995, before beginning play in 1996.\n\"I had less than three months before we were going to play in 10 cities. It was a whirlwind kickstart. We had an incredibly successful first year because everyone was kicking the tires and thinking that it's going to be like the World Cup, and leagues are not like the World Cup. Leagues are there to endure and stay and have a legacy,\" Logan said.And more than 30 years later, MLS has endured and is building its legacy brick by brick. This year won't have such a sprint compared to what '94 did, but with the coming shift, it's clear that the league is also entering a new era. New stadium projects will also see New York City FC's time playing at Yankee Stadium come to an end, and MLS has a massive opportunity in the wake of the World Cup.But the trajectory doesn't end there because it also impacts the youth level, which MLS EVP and Chief Communications Officer Dan Courtemanche notes.\n\"We're a league now that has elite player development and incredible facilities, and 43,000 kids playing in MLS NEXT. My son plays U15 MLS NEXT. He's with an elite club; he plays against the Red Bulls, New York City FC, the Revolution, and D.C. United, and I see the sophistication now at the youth level,\" Courtemanche said. \"This is my 34th season about to start in professional soccer but I'm only a few season in when it comes to viewing it as a soccer parent at a serious level, and my son, when he's done within 24 to 36 hours, he goes onto Taka.io, the software program, our partners, and he can see videos of all the key plays that he made, the pluses and the minuses and it helps him evaluate his game he works with his coach and it makes him better, and I gotta tell you, I didn't see that coming probably even five or 10 years ago that 43,000 kids have access to that.\"With players like Alex Freeman and Obed Vargas making the jump to top level European leagues this year and others like Cavan Sullivan set to follow in the future, the impact of MLS Next on youth soccer can't be understated as well as the impact that the United Soccer League has in offering more pathways and opportunities for people to play and learn about soccer who may not have previously been able to.Capitalizing on the World Cup waveWhile there's optimism about what MLS can gain from the World Cup, it's critical to catch soccer fans soon after the World Cup. It's easier to do when the league can now say, \"Look at these players who were at the World Cup, you can keep watching them in MLS,\" which isn't something that could've been said to this degree in previous World Cups outside of members of North American national teams. Truth be told, 2022 was a banner year for MLS at the World Cup, and the 2026 edition is set to be even bigger. Messi joined MLS in the following summer, and he won the Ballon d'Or as a member of Inter Miami for his production in 2022.\nLionel Messi's 2023 Ballon d'Or was awarded to him as a member of Inter Miami. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            \"During the last two years, in total attendance, we were the second-highest attended league in the world behind the Premier League. And I wouldn't have imagined that either,\" Courtemanche said. \"So look, the world's game is here. It's continuing. And even during the World Cup in 2022, we had 37 players from Major League Soccer competing for various national teams. That was more than any other league in the Western Hemisphere.\"But how that conversion is done is critical. Just because someone watches the World Cup doesn't mean that they'll automatically decide that MLS is the league for them, but the league will need to ensure that it capitalizes on those people sampling soccer to turn them into domestic fans.\"One of the things that has happened after every World Cup in recent times is that the domestic league that plays in the host country receives a big boost,\" Hunt said. \"If you look at the attendance numbers, the TV viewership, in the year or two after a country hosts the World Cup, those numbers grow significantly. And I think in a country like the United States, where we still have an opportunity to create a lot of new soccer fans, I think that'll be particularly pronounced. And so MLS will have a real opportunity to benefit both in terms of fans attending games and watching the league on TV. So I think that's very exciting for Major League Soccer and something that we need to make sure we capitalize on.\"\nMLS isn't a league that has been around for the vast majority of Americans' lives like some other places that have hosted World Cups, but with a fandom that tends to a younger demographic, the league can set itself up well for the next 30-plus years, although, hopefully, it won't take that long for the World Cup to return to America. Soccer in America has come a long way since the last World Cup, and it could be unrecognizable, taking another look back in the future, in a good way, considering the successes that have happened since the MLS' founding. American players have taken massive steps over the last several years, and MLS has as well. They are counting on their growth to continue, be further cultivated by the World Cup, and for the next set of years to bring exponential growth initial founders could have only dreamed of.\n            ",

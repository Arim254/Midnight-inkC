    "body": "\n        Move over, Wilt Chamberlain, you have company. A high school basketball player in Arizona became the latest to join the 100-point club, and he needed just three quarters to do so.Adrian Stubbs, a guard at Phoenix (Ariz.) Maryvale, became the first player in Arizona high school basketball history to score 100 points in a game with his historic effort in a 109-25 victory over Yuma (Ariz.) Kofa on Tuesday. He scored 70 points in the first half and added 30 more to his tally in the third quarter before taking a seat on the bench for the final period.Stubbs shattered the 6A record, which belonged to recent Arizona Wildcats standout Nico Mannion at 57 points. He surpassed the state record of 75 points, which had stood since the 1965-66 1A season, early in the third quarter. Stubbs' previous career high was 56, one point shy of the 6A record.\"This kid doesn't cease to amaze me,\" Maryvale coach Jeremy Smith said to The Arizona Republic. \"His will to win and fight and grit are second to none. He's got a lot of people backing him, wanting the best for him. He's a gamer. Before the season started, we had team goals. And we have individual goals. One of his individual goals was to beat Nico Mannion's record of 57.\"\nIt was a remarkably efficient performance for Stubbs, who entered the game averaging 24 points per game and hardly missed a shot in Tuesday's contest. The majority of his conversions came on mid-range jumpers, and he connected on only six 3-pointers. He went 16-for-23 from the free throw line.Stubbs got off to a hot start with 35 points in the first quarter, and his teammates got out of the way as he continued to drill seemingly every shot he put up. He scored every single one of Maryville's points in the first half before Travis Dean and Meqhi Teutsch contributed two points apiece in the third quarter.\"I think I had 35 at the end of the first quarter and my coach gave me the green light,\" Stubbs said. \"I was going to go. That was probably the most unselfish game (from teammates) I've ever seen in my life. Without them, this would not be possible. All of those passes. All the steals. It's a huge shout out to them.\"\nStubbs is an unranked recruit in the 2026 class, per 247Sports. His only scholarship offers to date are from junior colleges.\n            ",

The Cleveland Cavaliers didn't expect to surpass their loss total from last season more than a month before the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, but coming off a 64-18 season is a tough standard to maintain. The Cavaliers haven't been nearly as dominant over their 22-19 start to the 2025-26 NBA season, but the SportsLine projection model expects them to pick up a quality Eastern Conference win over the Philadelphia 76ers as a part of its Wednesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Cavaliers vs. 76ers is 235.5 points, down three from the opening line. The model has also locked in a college basketball best bet, backing No. 14 North Carolina to cover as 3.5-point favorites against Stanford in California. One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball pick on Iona vs. Rider at 7 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

The Cavaliers are coming off a 123-112 upset loss to the Jazz on Monday, but they were 5-2 over their prior seven games before that result. Cleveland travels to Philadelphia, but the Cavaliers have won two of their last three road games, including knocking off the Spurs. The Cleveland lineup features the majority of the same pieces from last year's 64-18 season, leading the model to consider the Cavaliers a better team than their current 22-19 record indicates. The 76ers have lost two of their last three home games, and the model projects the Cavaliers to win in 60% of simulations, showcasing strong value at their current odds. Back the Cavaliers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:North Carolina (-3.5) vs. Stanford (-110)The Tar Heels had the No. 5 freshman class this season, according to rankings by 247Sports, highlighted by 6-foot-10 freshman forward Caleb Wilson. Wilson was the No. 8-ranked Class of 2025 player by 247Sports, and he's justified that position with four 20-point double-doubles over his last five games. He's averaging 19.5 points and 11 rebounds per game this season. The Tar Heels also have experience, though, with senior center Henri Veesaar (16.9 points, 9.2 rebounds) and senior guard Seth Trimble (15.7 ppg). North Carolina (14-2, 2-1 ACC) is No. 14 in the nation and 8-1 over its last nine games, including a road victory over Kentucky. Stanford (13-4, 2-2) is coming off a 70-55 loss to No. 23 Virginia on Saturday. The model projects North Carolina to cover in 57% of simulations. Back North Carolina at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Iona (-7.5) vs. Rider (-110)\"Things aren't going too well for Rider, which might have a case as the worst-shooting team in America,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"To wit: only four teams out of 361 shoot less accurately from the floor than the Broncs' 38.6%, and there isn't one team that shoots triples worse than Rider, whose at 24.7% from beyond the arc are bottom-of-the-barrel nationally, with second-worst East Carolina not even that close. The plight is reflected by All-Name soph guard Flash Burton, who followed up his recent 27-point game vs. Fairfield by getting blanked on Sunday by Marist. Meanwhile, Iona has steadied since scoring just 38 in a recent lopsided loss vs. that same Marist, blowing out Niagara and Canisius last week while allowing just 50 ppg in the process.\" Back Iona at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks for Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

UFC 324 takes over Las Vegas with a headline-grabbing main event: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett for the interim lightweight title. It all goes down from the T-Mobile Arena as the first numbered event of 2026.UFC CEO Dana White's announcement of the card during halftime of the Cowboys vs. Chiefs on Thanksgiving garnered widespread attention. Gaethje and Pimblett have been campaigning for a lightweight title shot. In the aftermath of 155-pound champion Ilia Topuria announcing he'd step away to deal with personal matters, Gaethje and Pimblett will fight for the interim title.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Pimblett, meanwhile, is a man on the rise as he looks to get his first piece of UFC gold. The Brit is undefeated in seven trips to the Octagon, including an impressive TKO of Michael Chandler last April. Gaethje represents by far the biggest test of Pimblett's young career.\nThe rest of the main card is loaded with interesting and important matchups within each division. The co-main event sees former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley look to get back on track -- and hold his position in the division -- when he takes on rising contender Song Yadong. Plus, powerful heavyweights are set to collide when veteran and fan favorite Derrick Lewis returns to take on fast rising contender Waldo Cortes-Acosta. Former women's strawweight champion Rose Namajunas also looks to hold on to her position in the women's flyweight division when she takes on Natalia Silva. And the opening fight on the main card is sure to produce fireworks when Jean Silva takes on Arnold Allen at featherweight.Subscribe to Paramount+ now to get access to the UFC fight library and get ready for UFC 324\n        \n            \n                UFC Fan Guide: A playlist of some of the most exciting fights in history to get ready for the Paramount+ era\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is the complete fight card for UFC 324, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\n        Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are overwhelming favorites to win the upcoming Australian Open, the first major of 2026 in men's and women's tennis to kick-off a robust schedule. Four-time grand slam champion Sinner (-120 at FanDuel Sportsbook) is going for a three-peat in Melbourne after defeating Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev in each of the last two Australian Open men's finals. Sabalenka had won consecutive grand slams at the Australian Open before American Madison Keys topped her in last year's finals in three sets. The world No. 1 on the women's side is the favorite (+210) ahead of Iga Swiatek (+440), Elena Rybakina (+750) and Coco Gauff (+850). Sabalenka is gunning for her fifth career major after winning the US Open and coming in second at Wimbledon last year.Carlos Alcaraz, whose best career finish in Australia is a quarterfinal appearance, will have play his best to have a shot at squaring off with Sinner in another major final. Alcaraz has won seven of the last eight matchups between the titans, including three major finals culminating with his brilliant showing at the 2025 US Open.Where to watch Australian Open men's, women's singlesDate: Qualifying runs through Jan. 17; Main-draw play begins Jan. 18Location: Melbourne Park Sports and Entertainment Precinct -- Melbourne, AustraliaTV: ESPN, ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Note: Since Melbourne is 16 hours ahead of the Eastern Time zone in the United States, many matches will be shown live during the middle of the night. When individual match pairings are released for the main draw, keep that in mind while planning your viewing schedule.\nCan the American men break the streak?Andy Roddick is the most recent American to win a slam slam title on the men's side when he captured the 2003 US Open. Since, tennis has been dominated by three of the best players in history, including Novak Djokovic, who will appear in the Australian Open along with the emergence of Sinner and Alcaraz.Americans Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton, two of the top-10 players in the world, have been the most consistent pair over the last two years with big serves and increased precision during grand slams. Fritz's best major finish was a semifinal trip at Wimbledon last year while Shelton advanced to the semifinals in Melbourne.Aryna Sabalenka enters with razor-sharp focusSabalenka pocketed another Brisbane International title this month to send a warning shot to those in the Australian Open main draw -- she's out for blood. Sabalenka did not drop a set in her grand slam warmup and leads what should be a competitive field. Since winning the 2023 Australian Open for her first major title, Sabalenka and Polish standout Iga Swiatek have combined to take eight of the last 12 grand slams on the women's side. \"I'll do my best to go as far as possible,\" Sabalenka said.\nNovak Djokovic goes for 25th majorDjokovic, the fourth-ranked player in the world on the men's side, withdrew from the Australian Open tuneup tournament has not played an official match since November when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final of the Hellenic Championship. After that victory, Djokovic announced he was skipping ATP Finals with a shoulder injury and instead shifted his focus toward 2026's first grand slam.Djokovic is a 10-time Australian Open champion, last winning the tournament in 2023. He already holds the career lead with 24, and he nearly won that elusive 25th major on tour last year but came up short in the semifinals of all four events. Djokovic, 38, hinted at retirement last year after losing to Jannik Sinner in the French Open and his words following his US Open loss in September mirrored those remarks.It's clear, he wants to win one more grand slam before potentially untying his sneakers one final time as a professional athlete and one of the greatest players of all-time.\n\"Yeah, it will be very difficult for me in the future to overcome the hurdle of Sinner or Alcaraz in a best-of-5 in a grand slam,\" Djokovic said in September. \"I think I have a better chance best-of-3, but best-of-5 is tough. I'm not giving up on grand slams in that regard, having said that, I'm going to continue fighting and try to get to the finals and fight for an another trophy at least. But, you know, it's going to be a very difficult task.\"Coco Gauff eyes third career majorAfter claiming her fourth-straight win over Swiatek during the United Cup in Sydney, Gauff became the only player to have beaten the former world No. 1 four consecutive times in straight sets. The budding superstar on the American side has never won the Australian Open, but is not lacking confidence entering the first major of the year.The 21-year-old Gauff, who's ranked No. 4 in the world, took to Instagram after beating Swiatek and reposted a photo of a leaping two-handed backhand smash at the net, one of several impressive winners during the match.\n\"Def(initely) my favorite shot to hit. My version of a slam dunk lol. Not as climatic but still cool I think haha,\" Gauff wrote.Gauff won the French Open last year and Wimbledon in 2023. Her best finish down under was a semifinal loss to Sabalenka in 2024.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After more than three decades of seeing Christian Laettner's buzzer-beating game-winner in Duke's win vs. Kentucky in the 1992 Elite Eight replayed on national TV, it must have been nice for UK fans to be on the winning side of a similar play. But Malachi Moreno's turnaround jumper at the final horn was only part of the story from the Wildcats' 75-74 win at LSU on Wednesday. UK dug itself a 19-3 hole and trailed by as much as 18 in the second half before rallying to win a road tilt featuring plenty of tension for both teams.Kentucky (10-6, 2-2 SEC) would likely have fallen to First Four Out territory in CBS Sports Bracketology with a loss. Instead, the Wildcats are expected to rise from a No. 11 seed to a No. 10 seed. LSU (12-5, 0-4) needed a win to get onto the right side of the bubble and to alleviate some of the mounting pressure on fourth-year coach Matt McMahon.In a battle between desperate league foes figuring out life without injured starting point guards, it was Kentucky that found a way in the end. So how did the Wildcats surge back from their second straight abysmal start for their second straight win?\nHere's the anatomy of a comeback that may go down as a season-saver for Kentucky.Riding the star guardsKentucky coach Mark Pope rode his star guards in the second half, keeping Otega Oweh and Denzel Aberdeen on the floor for all 20 minutes as the Wildcats sought to replicate a formula that worked for them on Saturday in a 92-68 win over Mississippi State.In that win over the Bulldogs, which featured a similarly ugly start, the duo combined for 38 points, including 23 in the second half. Oweh and Aberdeen were encouragingly efficient (15 of 26 from the field) in that game. But could they stack back-to-back strong performances? Early on at LSU, the answer appeared to be a resounding no.\nOweh missed his first four shots as Kentucky got bogged down in directionless half court possessions against the Tigers. But he bounced back to finish 6 of 13 from the field and 6 of 10 from the free-throw line. Of Oweh's game-high 21 points, 15 came after halftime. All 17 of Aberdeen's points came after halftime as the duo combined to hit 5 of 7 attempts from beyond the arc.\nEven before this week's announcement from Pope that starting point guard Jaland Lowe will miss the rest of the season because of a lingering shoulder injury, the Wildcats needed more from Oweh and Aberdeen. They are finally getting it.More Williams and MorenoSix of Kentucky's 10 most-effective two-man combinations against high-major opposition entering Wednesday night involved Kam Williams. Pope must have seen the data, because he finally put the sophomore wing in the starting lineup against LSU for the first time since Dec. 5. Though he scored just five points, Williams continued to provide a critical element of floor-spacing while logging 16 minutes in the second half.\nThe Tulane transfer also provided a massive defensive lift with his steal and flush that gave Kentucky its first lead of the game with just under four minutes remaining.\nWilliams was key in lifting out of a slow start against Mississippi State on Saturday and continues to look like the sort of connector piece the Wildcats need to keep things moving offensively. Williams also gives Pope some options, as he's big enough to play in a small-ball four role.Moreno has reentered the starting lineup for the past two games amid the absence of Jayden Quaintance. While the status of Quaintance, a center with potential first-round NBA Draft potential, remains an uncertainty, Moreno continues to blossom. The freshman seven-footer finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and one memorable buzzer-beater against LSU.\nThe No. 27 overall prospect from the Class of 2025 is a local product from nearby Georgetown, Kentucky, who looks like a potential long-term building block for Pope. Even if Quaintance can't consistently be part of the UK rotation, the Wildcats have a great alternative with Moreno who could factor in to the future in a way that Quaintance likely won't.Andrija Jelavic gets a startThere wasn't much underlying data to suggest that Croatian newcomer Andrija Jelavic's performance warranted a promotion to the starting lineup. But the 6-foot-11 stretch big played well in his first career start, finishing with 11 points and five rebounds. He was on the floor for 11 straight minutes to begin the second half as UK trimmed a 16-point halftime deficit to six.We'll see whether Jelavic remains a fixture in the starting lineup from here on out for Kentucky, but he was good enough against the Tigers to deserve another opportunity. His increased role has come with a price for others.\nWith Jelavic and Moreno heavily featured against LSU, Brandon Garrison logged just five minutes in the second half. One game after logging a season-low 13 minutes against Mississippi State, Mo Dioubate set another season-low with just 12 minutes. During UK's two-game SEC winning streak, the uncomfortable truth is that the Wildcats have been better with those two former starters in reduced roles. While both bring physicality in the frontcourt, neither are particularly skilled on offense.With Lowe out and Kentucky struggling to execute in half-court situations, the floor-stretching ability of Jelavic and Williams -- along with Moreno's development as a passer -- is forcing Pope to reimagine how he allots minutes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A major reinforcement could be on the way for the San Francisco 49ers defense. Just over three months after he suffered a devastating ankle injury, linebacker Fred Warner returned to practice on Tuesday. And, shockingly, he is not ruling out availability for Saturday's divisional round game against the Seattle Seahawks.Such a speedy recovery is a remarkable feat for Warner, who was initially deemed out for the season when he broke and dislocated his ankle in Week 6 against the Bucs. Warner underwent surgery after teammate Ji'Ayir Brown rolled up on his leg and twisted his ankle at an awkward angle.\"We're taking it day by day,\" Warner said Wednesday when asked if he anticipated playing this weekend. \"I think they said last week they weren't going to open my [practice] window, and then my window is now open. So we're just taking it day by day.\"Warner was part of the wave of injuries that devastated the 49ers early in the year. Defensive end Nick Bosa was lost for the season due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3, and key contributors including quarterback Brock Purdy and Ricky Pearsall also missed time. Star tight end George Kittle saw his campaign come to a close in the Wild Card round when he tore an Achilles tendon.\nDespite the poor injury luck, San Francisco stands just two wins away from the Super Bowl.If Warner returns to the lineup this weekend, he would bolster a defense that seems to be rounding back into prime form. The 49ers surrendered a modest 19 points to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round and gave up just 13 points to the Seahawks in the season finale. But things have not always been so bright in Warner's absence.\"I feel amazing,\" Warner said. \"Just so grateful, blessed to be back. I think, obviously, when all this happened, I didn't really think about the possibility of returning in-season. But the way things progressed and being able to have this opportunity to be back with my teammates, have a chance at helping them win this week and so on and so forth, that's my only goal moving forward.\"\nWhile the injury dashed his chances of securing first-team All-Pro honors for the fourth consecutive year and fifth time in six seasons, Warner has a chance to rewrite an otherwise lost season. He is one of the best linebackers in the NFL and would contribute immense amounts of leadership and playmaking ability to the middle of the defense if he suits up before the postseason run is over.\"Fred's the ultimate energy-giver, so just having him out there is awesome,\" defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. \"Yesterday was a little bit more tempo down, but today obviously with higher tempo it'll be fun to get him out there, see him running around.\"Warner had not missed a game in his career prior to the injury. If he does not play again this year, he will finish with a career-low 51 tackles, two tackles for loss and three passes defended.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Alvaro Arbeloa era at Real Madrid has gotten off to a rocky start with the club getting knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the hands of second-tier Albacete 3-2 on Wednesday. Mired currently in LaLiga 2, Albacete are closer to being relegated than they are in pushing for a place in LaLiga, but cup matches can be the great equalizer in soccer. Real Madrid were without Kylian Mbappe in the squad, as he has been dealing with a knee injury, and there was rotation everywhere, but it was Albacete who struck first with Javi Villar scoring in the first half. Franco Mastantuono equalized before halftime, but at no point did Real Madrid seem comfortable away from home. The match would be a deadlock until the 80th minute, with Real Madrid regulars such as Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Carvajal entering the match, but by then, Albacete felt the belief, with substitute forward Jefte Betancor scoring. \nLos Blancos equalized again via Gonzalo Garcia in stoppage time, but yet again, Bentancor struck back to ensure that this match wouldn't go into extra time. With the Real Madrid job being Arbeola's first foray into top flight managment, this match was an important test for a side with sky-high ambitions, and it's one that he fell flat in. In a match like this, even if Madrid don't have their preferred starting XI available, they're expected to emerge with a victory, and instead, despite having 78% of possession, Madrid allowed three goals from only five shots on target.\nAfter falling to Barcelona in the Supercopa de España and moving on from Xabi Alonso as the manager of the club, things need to turn around sooner rather than later for Real Madrid as they're four points behind Barcelona for the LaLiga lead while also still being alive in Champions League play. But for Albacete, this is a moment to celebrate.Who are Albacete?Founded in 1939, this is a team that hasn't been in La Liga since the 2004-05 season. They've been mainstays in the second division, only rarely threatening to make the playoffs for a shot at the top flight, and this season is no different, with the club sitting in 17th place. There is an American on the books in left back Jonathan Gomez, who has been bouncing around Spain since leaving Louisville City FC in 2021, and he came on in the second half as a substitute to help bring fresh legs to the match. He has been far from a regular starter for the club but has still made 20 appearances this season. A club with no notable top-flight trophies, this is a night that will go down in history in Albacete as they now have a place in the Copa Del Rey quarterfinals, and who knows, they could go further and win the whole thing.\nMore worries for Real MadridOn one hand, Arbeloa's inexperience can be looked past due to being a former Real Madrid player, but starting off management on this foot couldn't bring more pressure onto the new Real Madrid manager. A weekend match with Levante would seem like a bounce-back moment for Los Blancos, especially with them being at home at the Santiago Bernabeu, but after losing this match, it's hard to have confidence in what Real Madrid will do. After that, the difficulty level only picks up, closing out January with Champions League matches against Monaco and Benfica (live on Paramount+), along with a LaLiga match against Villarreal. Dropping more points will only make it harder to claw back space in LaLiga before the next Clasico with Barcelona in May, but to even have that chance, Arbeloa will need to establish his style on the squad sooner rather than later. Alonso only lasted seven months on the job, and if things spiral more, there's a real possibility that Real Madrid could see three managers in one season as time waits for no one at the club.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In an ongoing trend of talent departures from league to league, WSL in England has pried another one of the National Women's Soccer League's prime players.In a move that adds more gasoline to the raging fires of pro league debates, Manchester City announced they have signed U.S. women's national team midfielder and former Portland Thorns captain, Sam Coffey, on Wednesday. Coffey departs the NWSL on a three-and-a-half-year deal through 2029 with the WSL side. The transfer is reportedly worth $875,000.While Coffey had two years remaining on her Thorns contract, the player was often transparent about her lifelong dream to one day play in Europe. She echoed the sentiment in a farewell video, referring to the move as something she \"simply has to pursue.\"\nWhat does it mean for Portland?There was an argument that during the tempestuous 2024 season, the Thorns' return to the 2024 playoff appearance was fueled by forward Sophia Wilson's undeniable offensive production in front of the goal. A similar debate could paint Coffey as the catalyst for the Thorns' elevated run in 2025. \nThe 27-year-old midfielder captained the Thorns to the 2025 NWSL semifinals and led the team in minutes played. She was a crucial component in Portland's midfield and was a central leadership figure for the club following retirements by Christine Sinclair, Becky Sauerbrunn, and Meghan Klingenberg. Coffey leaves the NWSL club a 2022 NWSL Championship winner and earned three NWSL Best XI selections (2022, 2023, 2025).Her departure exposes an immediate gap in the midfield, but it's just another question lingering around the club as it builds towards the 2026 season. There are also the bigger holes Coffey's absence will leave behind in terms of leadership, on-field performance, and off-pitch efforts.\"While the Thorns organization did everything it could to keep Sam in Portland, we thought it was important to support her ambitions while we continue building a team capable of competing for championships. We are grateful for her contributions and wish her success as she pursues her next opportunity,\" said president and general manager of soccer operations Jeff Agoos.\nIn the early days of the new year, Portland have just four midfielders listed on their current preseason roster. Venezuela international Deyna Castellanos, Canadian international Jessie Fleming, Olivia Moultrie, and the recently signed Shae Harvey out of Stanford University. There's the possibility that the 10 forwards currently on the preseason roster may fluctuate positionally, but that is an immediate conundrum for whoever the next Thorns' head coach will be.What does it mean for Manchester City and WSL?The move symbolizes the shift of power club dynamics in England between Chelsea FC, Arsenal, and Manchester City. Kerolin, the former 2023 NWSL MVP, who joined Manchester City in January 2025, was another domino to fall in favor of the Chelsea rivals, shortly following Vivianne Miedema's arrival at the club in July 2024 from Arsenal on a free transfer.Coffey's arrival only boosts the international power on the roster as she joins Kerolin, Miedema, Bunny Shaw, and Yui Hasegawa, among others. Manchester City currently control the WSL table with 33 points, with six points over Chelsea and 10 points ahead of Arsenal. \n\"Sam's reputation as one of the world's best speaks for itself, and we're delighted she's chosen to come here ahead of other potential suitors,' said City's director of women's football Therese Sjogran.\"We believe she has all the qualities needed to thrive at City and, more broadly, the WSL, and we're excited to see how she can elevate our already superb squad of players. Sam is playing at the top of her game, and I think her decision to come here shows the incredible progress we've made as a Club and the ambitions we have moving forward.\"There's no doubt Manchester City are now the team to chase on the table, and now they have to maintain the expectations they've set for themselves.\nThe NWSL will be fineA year ago, after Naomi Girma's departure, I claimed the NWSL would be fine, and I still mean it. But after repeated movement, even I'll admit my own sentiment behind it has shifted. The thing about Coffey's departure is mostly its timing. Ultimately, it was a move that was going to happen once the right opportunity came along. She's been as open and honest about how playing in Europe is a dream of hers, and the transparency does the NWSL a big service. If anything, it'll allow NWSL to commit to the messaging that this was ultimately what the player wanted. It also brings an entire year full circle in which the league lost multiple U.S. national team players and plenty of its league starting-level players. \nRising transfer fees, which some English clubs can offer with the resources of their men's clubs, have tipped the player movement scale. Over the last year, the league has struggled to grapple with its own identity in a search for financial mechanisms, like salary cap restrictions in the name of competitive parity. The playing level the NWSL views as one of assets, if not its greatest. The introduction of a \"High-Impact Player\" rule, voted on by the board in December, hasn't exactly resolved anything either. The HIP rule was a partial response to the ongoing contract saga with Trinity Rodman, another player the league has failed to re-sign at the moment. There was a deal in place in December between the winger and the Washington Spirit, which was a four-year deal that included backloaded portions of her contract. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman vetoed the contract, claiming the potential new contract violated the spirit of league rules. Rodman is currently unattached to any club as the season looms closer. \nThe new HIP mechanism allows teams to spend an additional $1 million on players who meet specific \"star\" criteria. The ability to offer competitive salaries, as the global transfer market rises, remains a hurdle for the women's leagues around the world, though the NWSL specifically has seen an increase in players leaving for teams overseas. NWSL clubs will be able to exceed the league's current salary cap by $1 million and use the HIP funds toward single or multiple player contracts. The HIP threshold will also increase annually alongside the salary cap, which is currently $3.5 million and set to rise to $5.1 million by 2030. No player has been signed utilizing the new rule since it was approved, though Denver Summit FC recently announced they signed USWNT midfielder Lindsey Heaps and alluded to the possibility of using the mechanism when she arrives midseason.\nThe NWSL Players Association recently filed a grievance challenging the NWSL \"High Impact Player\" rule. The NWSLPA is seeking immediate rescission of the rule, claiming \"a player compensation rule implemented without bargaining and in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and federal labor law.\"However, in the case of Coffey, you can never actually veto personal ambition. Now the league is in the midst of losing an identity that it never cemented in the first place. If you're the league of parity it is because you have talent on the rosters to claim that. The NWSL is well on its way to becoming a league of trends, instead of innovation.Once upon a time, there was an allocation system that distributed and paid the contracts of USWNT, Canada, and Mexico internationals to NWSL clubs, then those partnerships shifted as the league grew. In an attempt for more control in roster building, allocation money was introduced for 2020, then its expiration date was issued, and now it's sort of back in a larger, separate, more exclusive amount, as HIP money. \nOne of the HIP rule criteria a player can meet is \"marketability,\" a metric measured by whether or not a player is on SportsPro Media's Top 150 most marketable players, a list that somehow favors European players. It is perhaps the trend the NWSL is failing to escape the most. Though trends have always been part of the league. Once, NWSL was the home of several Australian women's national team members, and now it is the home of multiple Brazilian players. It once promised to trend towards more women in head coaching positions, and there will now be three in 2026 instead of two as the league expands to 16 teams. There's even a new trend of former MLS coaches in the league, with Denver's Nick Cushing and Kansas City's Chris Armas hired this offseason.Trends fade and become memories. Sometimes they are recalled when true innovation is lacking, and the need for some kind of inspiration is necessary. While they come and go, it's still what NWSL audiences, new and old, will keep an eye on.\nHopefully, the loss of a homegrown captain in her prime is a clear enough signal that retaining its USWNT assets will be the league's defining challenge of the moment. Over recent years, it's been facility infrastructure, resources, and match schedule management. As the league changes, the challenges it faces will change too. From Girma to Kerolin, even to players whose moves haven't quite worked out in Crystal Dunn and Jenna Nighswonger, you cannot deny that the most pressing challenge is the imbalance of players leaving to competing leagues versus incoming players from those same leagues. Alongside losing multiple players to overseas competition, the league has mostly failed to lure overseas talent to the NWSL, at least at the rate players have left overseas in one year.  I do still believe the NWSL will be fine, but what league that is proclaiming to be the best in the world wants to be just fine?The USWNT will be better than fineCoffey's departure overseas now adds another starting caliber U.S. women's national team player abroad. Alongside Emily Fox, Girma, and Heaps, that makes four players who have been regulars across starting lineups for head coach Emma Hayes since her managerial arrival ahead of the Paris Olympics in 2024. You add in Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson, and Phallon Tulis-Joyce, who have been consistent features in the starting XI in just 2025 alone, that builds up to seven players. And if you're the type that loves a \"this young athlete is ready to start right now' debate, you can consider Lily Yohannes as the eighth USWNT player.That would mean more than half of a starting caliber lineup for the USWNT plays their club soccer overseas. Removing NWSL from that equation, the national team is going be better than fine or even OK. Concacaf rivals might be back to fearing the Stars and Stripes once again in the months leading up to the World Cup qualifiers in November.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The co-main event of UFC 324, featuring Kayla Harrison defending the women's bantamweight title against Amanda Nunes, has been postponed, CBS Sports has learned. Harrison underwent surgery on Tuesday to address herniated discs in her neck, according The Eagle Tribune, which first reported the postponement.The Harrison-Nunes fight was considered by many to be the biggest bout in the history of women's mixed martial arts. The matchup will be moved to a later date that has yet to be determined. Sean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong will now serve as the co-main event in the bantamweight division. Plus, Rose Namajunas vs. Natalia Silva at women's flyweight was moved from the featured prelims to the main card.The main card now reads as follows:Paddy Pimblett vs. Justin Gaethje, interim lightweight titleSean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong, bantamweightsWaldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis, heavyweightsNatalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas, women's flyweightsJean Silva vs. Arnold Allen, featherweightsHarrison, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in judo, won the bantamweight title with a second-round submission of Julianna Pena last June. The fight was Harrison's third in the Octagon after fighting the rest of her career in the PFL. Harrison has won all three of her UFC fights, with two wins by submission, clearing doubts many had that she would not be able to safely and consistently cut to bantamweight with her large frame. Harrison had fought at featherweight and, predominantly, lightweight during her PFL career.\nNunes is near unanimously considered the greatest female fighter in the history of the sport. She won the bantamweight championship at UFC 200, and after three successful defenses, moved to featherweight to win that title. Nunes moved back to 135 for four more successful title defenses before a shocking upset loss to Pena at UFC 269. Nunes won the rematch with Pena at UFC 277 and, after defending the title one final time against Irene Aldana at UFC 289, announced her retirement from the sport.Nunes entered the Octagon after Harrison's win over Pena, signaling a return from retirement to set up a massive fight that will now have to wait.In her career, Nunes holds 10 wins over women who have held UFC championships.\nUFC 324 takes place Saturday, Jan. 24, from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The event is the first in the landmark media rights deal between UFC and Paramount. It will stream live on Paramount+ and is included with the price of a subscription as the deal also marked the end of pay-per-view UFC events.\n            ",

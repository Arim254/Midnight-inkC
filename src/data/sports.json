    "body": "\n        Anthony Hernandez will look for the biggest win of his career on Saturday when he faces Sean Strickland in a middleweight clash in the main event of UFC Fight Night from Toyota Center in Houston.Strickland is a former UFC middleweight champion, having scored a shock win over Israel Adesanya at UFC 293. He would go on to drop the title in his next fight, a split decision loss to Dricus du Plessis at UFC 297. Strickland rebounded with a split decision win over Paulo Costa before losing in a championship rematch with du Plessis.Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC Fight Night LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription. Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Hernandez's UFC career got off to a rough start, going 1-2 in his first three fights in the Octagon. He has since rattled off eight wins in a row to climb to the No. 4 spot in the official UFC middleweight rankings, one spot behind Strickland.\nUFC Fight Night also features two perennial contenders looking to protect their places in the pecking order. Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. Elsewhere on the undercard, ranked heavyweights are set to collide when Ante Delija and Serghei Spivac face off. Delija is looking to bounce back from a surprising knockout loss to rising contender Waldo Cortes Acosta in November. Prior to that, Delija scored two first-round knockouts in his first two UFC appearances. And an interesting UFC debut is set at welterweight when Josiah Harrell takes on Jacobe Smith. Harrell was scheduled to make his promotional debut at UFC 290 against Jack Della Maddalena, but during his fight week medical screening, doctors discovered he had Moyamoya, a rare brain disease that causes the arteries supplying blood to the brain to become narrowed or blocked. Now, nearly three years later, he gets his chance to make a first impression.Below is all the information you need to catch the action on Saturday night.

    "body": "\n        Although Ryan Garcia has tried his best throughout the build to their WBC welterweight title clash to frame his former trainer's hiring by opponent Mario Barrios as an act of treason, Joe Goossen's presence is likely to play a key role in the result of Saturday's pay-per-view headliner. Goossen, the 72-year-old broadcaster and Hall-of-Fame trainer, has had a relationship with Garcia (24-2, 20 KOs) dating back to his amateur days and worked his corner as head trainer for three consecutive fights, culminating in a 2023 PPV knockout loss to Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis.Despite the fact that Garcia and Goossen parted ways on good terms (amid industry rumors that questioned Garcia's work ethic and suggested he never truly bought in to Goossen's teachings), Garcia used the storyline to create a circus of their introductory press conference in January to announce this weekend's fight (DAZN PPV, 7:55 p.m. ET) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Not only did the 27-year-old Garcia, a native of Victorville, California, join his father/trainer Henry in attempting to create a soap opera by feigning heartbreak over Goossen's decision, the younger Garcia also presented a t-shirt with Goossen's name on the front and the word \"traitor\" on the back and threw it at his former coach. \nWhen asked by CBS Sports on Tuesday whether he was truly emotional over the situation or whether this was yet another attempt by the enigmatic Garcia to stir the pot and play mental games with his opponent, \"King Ryan\" shared a sly smile.\"I don't know how I actually feel about it, I just know my first instinct was a little laughter within myself,\" Garcia said. \"[I thought to myself,] 'That's pretty, pretty funny.' I say that with sarcasm. I wonder if [Barrios] even thought about it. Did he think about it? I guess nobody gives a f--- in this game. Cool, let's f---ing go. Now, I'm really going to rip this dude's head off and I'm going to beat his ass in front of [Goossen] bad.\"It's always a little bit of motivation within myself. It's almost as if you want to whip his ass more just to show them that I don't care who is training him, I'll whip his ass bad.\"\nFrom the perspective of Barrios, a 30-year-old from San Antonio, there isn't a single part of the Garcia-led sideshow that matters to him ahead of the fight. In fact, he claims his decision to part ways with trainer Bob Santos in favor of Goossen had nothing to do with Garcia at all. \"The move to go be with Joe was going to happen whether this fight with Ryan was made or not,\" Barrios told CBS Sports last week. \"I was looking at what steps I wanted to make moving forward to continue to grow as a fighter and work on myself. I wanted to get back to some of the things that got me this far in the first place. I think it's just a lot of noise and drama. I feel like the press conference didn't have anything to do with me. It just had everything to do with Joe Goossen, Ryan and their past.\"The reason why Goossen's role is so integral to this fight is because he knows so much about what makes the inconsistent Garcia tick. For as spectacular as Garcia can look in one fight, he has so routinely battled with mental health challenges and outside-the-ring controversies that he has yet to fulfill the huge potential that comes along with his lightning fast hands, snapping power and gigantic social media following as a boxing superstar who organically built his image and following. \nGarcia looked sensational in dropping Devin Haney three times in their 2024 title clash but had his decision win overturned after he tested positive for the banned substance ostarine and engaged in one public meltdown after another during his one-year suspension. Garcia returned last May against WBA welterweight titleholder Rolando Romero as a heavy favorite but was dropped in Round 2 en route to losing a bizarre and lifeless decision. \"You know, there are many reasons [for the Romero loss in New York's Times Square,]\" Garcia said.\" It's very interesting looking back at how the energy actually was and why it was that way. I have my speculations but I don't even want to look back because I know right here is in front of me. I'm just looking forward to this moment and that's it because this has better vibes and you know that.\"Barrios doesn't just have inside knowledge on Garcia with Goossen, however, he also has the perfect coach (known for his offensive approach and ability to resurrect struggling boxers) to potentially bring back the fire in him that has been lacking in recent fights. \nIn 2023, Barrios looked as if his career had turned a major corner when he widely outpointed and retired former champion Yordenis Ugas to capture the WBC interim title. But a string of inconsistent performances followed as Barrios was forced to settle for back-to-back draws in title defenses against Abel Ramos in 2024 and 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last July while being criticized for not doing enough offensively when it mattered. \"I definitely feel like people are always going to talk and write your name off,\" Barrios said. \"You can go in there and perform sensationally and there will always be somebody that will find something. I am definitely proud of [my performance against] Pacquiao but there are things I would've done differently. I definitely should have pressed the gas early on and I think it would have been a different fight. That's why I think there wasn't much interest in a rematch. I feel like they knew that it's the best that he can look right now.\"\nGarcia remains the betting favorite against Barrios largely because of his brighter ceiling of potential and the fact that Barrios, who has previously headlined PPVs against Keith Thurman and Davis, has yet to win a major fight in which his face has been on the poster. But Garcia also needs to prove entering his fourth division that he can finally win a recognized world title and that his best performance to date against Haney wasn't a result of banned substance use.\n\"I do see it favoring me but it's because I'm the better fighter, that's it,\" Garcia said. \"That's what I have been putting into this camp. I see [Barrios] as a warrior that has been through a little bit of wars that is starting to wear him down. I don't think the new trainer switch into a fight like this is a good move and he's about to find out that it ain't a good move, at all. I think it's all going to backfire.\"Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds from getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Barrios vs. Garcia fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookRyan Garcia -250 vs. Mario Barrios (c) +195, WBC welterweight titleRichardson Hitchins (c) -380 vs. Oscar Duarte +280, IBF junior welterweight titleGary Antuanne Russell (c) -350 vs. Andy Hiraoka +260, WBA junior welterweight titleFrank Martin -390 vs. Nahir Albright +290, junior welterweightsPredictionThe flaws and inconsistencies of both fighters have the potential to play as big a role in the outcome of the fight as do their respective strengths. \nGarcia completely fell apart mentally in losses to both Davis and Romero as soon as he felt their heavy power flush in the early going. The problem for Barrios, however, is that he isn't a puncher at 147 pounds on the level of either of those names. When Barrios is at his best, he's an aggressive boxer who goes to the body and leads the dance. But like Garcia, at his worst, he can lose focus in a hurry and begin to follow his opponent around. The X-factor in this fight is undoubtedly going to be the hand speed and power of Garcia, who by far owns the biggest weapons in the matchup. Even if Barrios, who is the more consistent boxer of the two in recent years, can build an early lead, the potential for Garcia to package knockdowns in an effort to build a formidable lead on the scorecards is there, even if he doesn't score a finish against the durable Barrios. \nPick: Garcia via UD12Who wins Mario Barrios vs. Ryan Garcia on Saturday, and which pick should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Saturday welterweight title bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 4 Arizona earned solo possession of first in the Big 12 standings on Saturday with a gritty 73-66 road win over No. 2 Houston. The shorthanded Wildcats used a 12-0 run in the second half to pull away and hand the Cougars their first home loss since Feb. 1 of last year.Arizona failed to reach 75 points for the first time since Dec. 20, but its defense carried the day, as Houston missed 10 straight field goal attempts late in the second half.Fresh off a season-high 22-point outing in a win over BYU, Anthony Dell'Orso turned in another massive game with 22 again for the Wildcats (25-2, 12-2 Big 12). Jaden Bradley and Ivan Kharchenkov added 17 and 16, respectively. With star freshman forward Koa Peat missing his second straight game due to a lower leg injury and reserve wing Dwayne Aristode out for a third straight game, Arizona deployed a rotation of basically just six players in the second half.\nHouston (23-4, 11-3) has dropped consecutive games for the first time since January 2024. Freshman guard Kingston Flemings led the Cougars with 17 points, but they never found an offensive rhythm and weren't as defensively disruptive as normal.\nAfter forcing a season-low three turnovers in a Monday loss at Iowa State, Houston forced just five against Arizona. Offensively, Houston's 35.7% shooting mark was its second-worst of the season.Big 12 title race heating upThe stretch run will likely be tense, but Arizona is now well-positioned to win the Big 12 regular season during just its second season in the league. A year ago, Houston ran away with the conference title by a whopping four-game edge while the Wildcats finished third for third along with BYU. \nAmong the Wildcats' final four regular season games are clashes with top-10 foes Kansas and Iowa State. But both those games are at home. The Iowa State game could prove particularly consequential as the Cyclones remain firmly in the league title hunt as well.Despite its recent two-game slide, Houston shouldn't be counted out, either. The Cougars face a challenging road game at Kansas on Monday, but their final three games are against manageable foes Colorado, Baylor and Oklahoma State.This is shaping up as the most intriguing conference title race in the high-major ranks.\nBracketology implicationsBoth teams learned where they stand in the eyes of the NCAA Tournament selection committee prior to the game. The Wildcats landed as the third No. 1 seed in the March Madness bracket preview while Houston landed as the second No. 2 seed. While it's possible Arizona could move up to become the second No. 1 seed depending on the results of Saturday night's clash between No. 1 Michigan and No. 3 Duke, the CBS Sports Bracketology model will make a definitive forecast Sunday morning once Saturday's full results -- and the changes in metrics they bring -- have been factored in.Houston is expected to remain a No. 2 seed. But with Florida making a hard charge after being named the top No. 3 seed in the bracket preview, the Cougars would be wise to beat Kansas on Monday to avoid a potential flirtation with the No. 3 seed line.\n            ",

Coach Andy Reid confirmed discussions this week with their veteran pass-catcher, who finished his 13th NFL season with 76 catches for 851 yards and five touchdowns.\"There is communication. That's the main thing,\" Reid said. \"That means people want to move forward. I think that's where Trav is. I'm not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space here. He's been doing this a long time, and he can sort all that out as he goes forward. We're proceeding with that, and there is communication.\"Kelce, 36, said in January after the Chiefs failed to make the playoffs that he needed to see how his body responded after Kansas City's 6-11 finish. The Chiefs may be without quarterback Patrick Mahomes for the start of the 2026 season following an ACL injury.Kelce recently expressed anxiousness on his New Heights podcast to work again with Eric Bieniemy as the Chiefs' new offensive coordinator, suggesting he could be back. Bieniemy and Kelce spent a decade together.\n\"I can't wait to see him back in the building,\" Kelce said. \"He's one of my favorite coaches of all-time, one of my favorite people of all time. I've had so many unbelievable growing moments under him as a player, as a person, and I just love the guy and it's going to be awesome to see him back in the building and see him back wearing the Chiefs logo, baby.\"Kelce first mentioned retirement in 2023, acknowledged the toll playing for a decade-plus has taken on his body. He is also expecting to marry fiancée Taylor Swift later this year.\nNFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Friday that Kelce is trending toward a return and remains a \"functional\" player at his position.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Pirates legend and Hall of Famer Bill Mazeroski, who hit one of the most iconic home runs in baseball history, died on Friday. He was 89. Although he was one of the greatest defensive second basemen the game has ever seen, Mazeroski is best remembered for his walk-off home run against the Yankees in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series. \"Weird, isn't it?\" Mazeroski said during his Hall of Fame speech in 2001. \"Known for the home run and in the Hall of Fame because of your defense.\" \n\"Everyone across the Pirates organization is deeply saddened by the loss of Bill Mazeroski,\" Pirates chairman Bob Nutting said in a statement. \"... His name will always be tied to the biggest home run in baseball history and the 1960 World Series championship, but I will remember him most for the person he was: humble, gracious and proud to be a Pirate.\" Mazeroski's home run gave the Pirates their first World Series championship since 1925 even though the Yankees outscored the Pirates 55-27 in the seven games. Pittsburgh's minus-28 run differential is still the largest overcome by a World Series winner. Mazeroski went 8 for 25 (.320) with two home runs and 5 RBI in the series. \nIn honor of Mazeroski, here are 10 more of the most iconic home runs in baseball history, listed chronologically.  Oct. 3, 1951: \"The Giants win the pennant!\" The Brooklyn Dodgers had a 13-game lead over the crosstown rival New York Giants on Aug. 11, but the Giants' 37-7 finish to the season put the teams in a tie atop the National League. That sent the two rivals into a best-of-three tiebreaker series. The winner would meet the Yankees in the World Series. The Giants won Game 1. The Dodgers won Game 2, forcing a decisive Game 3. Game 3 was the first baseball game televised nationally. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the ninth inning, but the Giants rallied, and Ralph Branca replaced ace Don Newcombe on the mound. Down 4-2 with two runners on base and one out, Bobby Thomson hit Branca's second pitch out to left for a walk-off, pennant-clinching, three-run homer. \n\"The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!\" exclaimed radio broadcaster Russ Hodges.  April 8, 1974: Aaron breaks Ruth's record Babe Ruth was baseball's all-time home run king for more than 50 years, and his 714 career homers seemed like an unbreakable record. Three games into the 1974 season, however, Hammerin' Hank Aaron passed the Babe and became baseball's new home run king with his 715th career blast. He took Dodgers lefty Al Downing deep for the historic homer. \n\"It's gone! It's 715!\" said legendary broadcaster Milo Hamilton. \"There's a new home run champion of all-time, and it's Henry Aaron.\"   \n\"What  a marvelous moment for baseball,\" Vin Scully said on the Dodgers' broadcast. \"What a marvelous moment for Atlanta  and the state of Georgia. What a marvelous moment for the country and  the world.\"  Game 6 of 1975 World Series: Fisk waves it fair The 1975 World Series is one of the greatest ever. Three of the first four games were decided by one run, with the Reds mounting a ninth-inning comeback in Game 2 and the Red Sox doing the same to tie Game 3. With Boston facing elimination and down 6-3 in the eighth inning of Game 6, pinch-hitter Bernie Carbo swatted a three-run game-tying homer. Four innings later, Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk pulled a game-winning walk-off home run down the left field line at Fenway Park to save the Red Sox's season. He waved it fair as he left the batter's box. \nThe broadcast angle of Fisk waving the ball fair was a stroke of luck. The camera operator inside the Green Monster was distracted by a rat, and instead of following the ball's flight, the camera stayed on Fisk.  Game 6 of 1977 World Series: Mr. October Technically, this is three home runs. Yankees' slugger Reggie Jackson, after going deep in his final at-bat of Game 5, hit three home runs in his first three at-bats of Game 6 en route to New York's first World Series championship since 1962. Jackson hit four homers off four different pitchers in four at-bats spanning Games 5 and 6. \nAt the time, it was only the third three-homer game in World Series history. Babe Ruth had done it twice previously: Game 4 of the 1926 World Series and Game 4 of the 1928 World Series. \n Oct. 2, 1978: Bucky bleepin' Dent On July 19, the Yankees were 14 games behind the Red Sox in the AL East. A torrid finish -- 52-21 the rest of the way -- moved New York into a tie atop the AL East with Boston at the end of the regular season. The bitter rivals played a Game 163 tiebreaker to decide the division winner. The winner would meet the Royals in the ALCS; the loser would go home.The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead into the seventh inning with starter Mike Torrez seemingly in control. Back-to-back one-out singles put the tying run on base for New York, then light-hitting shortstop Bucky Dent flipped the game with a three-run go-ahead homer. The Yankees took a 3-2 lead and went on to win the game 5-4.  \nDent hit four home runs that season prior to Game 163, and he retired with 40 career homers in close to 1,400 games spanning 12 seasons. He and the Yankees completed the AL East comeback in Game 163 and went on to win the World Series. \n Game 1 of 1988 World Series: Gibson on one leg Knee and hamstring injuries kept Kirk Gibson, that year's NL MVP, on the sidelines for the 1988 World Series. Or so we expected. With the Dodgers down 4-3 with two outs in the ninth inning against Athletics Hall of Fame closer Dennis Eckersley, the clearly hobbled Gibson pinch-hit for Alejandro Pena, and lifted a two-out, two-strike, two-run walk-off home run to right field. \n\"All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, and all year long, he answered the demands,\" Vin Scully said on the broadcast. \"... High flyball into right field! She is gone! In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has  happened.\" The Dodgers went on to win the World Series in five games. The Game 1 walk-off home run was the only time Gibson saw the field in the series. \n Game 6 of 1991 World Series: \"We will see you tomorrow night!\" The Twins were in real trouble going into Game 6 of the 1991 World Series. Down 3-2 in the series to the Braves and facing Steve Avery, that year's NLCS MVP, in Game 6, Kirby Puckett put Minnesota on his back. He opened the scoring with an RBI triple in the first inning. In the third, he robbed Ron Gant of a game-tying two-run home run. With the score tied 3-3 in the 11th, Puckett saved the Twins' season (again) with a walk-off home run to force Game 7. \n\"And we will see you tomorrow night!\" said broadcaster Jack Buck after Puckett's walk-off blast.\nPuckett's Game 6 heroics made possible the classic Game 7 pitchers' duel between Jack Morris and John Smoltz. Morris threw a 10-inning shutout in a 1-0 win to give the Twins their second World Series title in five years.  Game 6 of 1993 World Series: \"Touch 'em all, Joe!\" Mazeroski's homer in 1960 was the first series-ending walk-off home run in baseball history. It wasn't the last. With the Blue Jays looking to repeat as champions in 1993, Joe Carter stepped to the plate against Phillies closer Mitch Williams with two runners on base and Toronto down 6-5 in the ninth inning of Game 6. Five pitches later, the Blue Jays had their second straight title. \n\"Touch 'em all, Joe! You'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!\" exclaimed legendary Blue Jays broadcaster Tom Cheek after Carter's walk-off three-run homer.\n Sept. 7, 1998: Big Mac hits No. 62 After hitting 61 home runs in 1961, Roger Maris was baseball's single-season home run king for nearly 40 years. The record stood until 1998, when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were locked in a home run chase that revitalized a sport that was still reeling from the 1994-95 strike. McGwire broke Maris' record with his 62nd home run on Sept. 7. \n\"Down the left field line. Is it enough? Gone! There it is. 62!\" said Hall of Famer Jack Buck on the broadcast. \"Touch first Mark, you are the new single-season home run king!\" McGwire finished the season with a then-single-season record 70 home runs. Sosa also eclipsed Maris that year. He hit 66 homers.  Aug. 7, 2007: Bonds breaks Aaron's record McGwire's 70 home runs were short-lived as the single-season record. Barry Bonds slugged 71 home runs three years later in 2001. Bonds hit 45 homers in 2002, 45 homers in 2003, and 45 homers again in 2004. By 2007, Hank Aaron's then-record 755 career home runs were within reach. On Aug. 7, Bonds took lefty Mike Bacsick deep for his 756th career blast. \nBonds added another six home runs that season and remains baseball's all-time leader with 766 career homers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The DP World Tour announced on Saturday that eight players from LIV Golf paid their fines and met certain requirements to be granted their conditional release for the 2026 season and remain eligible to play in DP World Tour events and the Ryder Cup.  However, Jon Rahm -- the biggest European star on LIV Golf -- was not among that group.Tyrrell Hatton, Laurie Canter, Thomas Detry, Tom McKibbin, Adrian Meronk, Victor Perez, David Puig and Elvis Smylie agreed to pay their fines, withdraw appeals against the DP World Tour and participate in certain events, media activities and promotions for the tour. As such, they were granted the opportunity to play LIV Golf events that conflict with DP World Tour tournaments. Rahm was not part of that group, leaving his status with the DP World Tour -- and Europe's Ryder Cup team in 2027 -- still in doubt. The DP World Tour noted that the agreements for conditional release were not precedent-setting; they only applied to the 2026 season.Rahm has refused to pay fines (reportedly topping $3 million) for playing in LIV Golf events that oppose those on the DP World Tour. He and Hatton were eligible to play in the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black after appealing their sanctions in September. A timeline has not been established for when a third-party arbiter will hear that appeal, but with this new agreement, Hatton (and Meronk, who was also part of the appeal) no longer needs to be involved. \nRahm still has another 18 months before he requires a ruling in his favor to be able to participate in the 2027 Ryder Cup at Adare Manor in Ireland; however, after not reaching an agreement with the DP World Tour alongside his eight LIV Golf compatriots, he's passed up a clear opportunity to regain status at least for this year. Given the nature of the agreement, which is only good for the 2026 season, a non-Ryder Cup year, Rahm may have felt it was unnecessary to relent in his legal battle. If Rahm's appeal is successful, he may avoid any financial penalties, and with LIV Golf picking up world ranking points this year, if Rahm maintains his rate of top 10 finishes from previous seasons -- plus strong finishes in the majors -- he can give himself a decent chance at qualification without needing many DP World Tour starts. \nStill, Rahm's European Ryder Cup teammates likely hoped he would have taken the opportunity to pay the fines, as Hatton did, and get back in good standing consdiering the positive vibes for the European squad coming out of their win in New York. \n            ",

Both clubs have very different goals for the rest of this EPL season as Man City is firmly in the title chase after Arsenal tied Wolves 2-2, so a win on Saturday would push the Citizens to just two points behind the Gunners. Plus, those two contenders have one more head-to-head matchup on the schedule. As for Newcastle, they're 10th in the EPL table and just snapped a three-match losing streak with a won over Tottenham in their most recent EPL match.

Arsenal just played the worst team in the Premier League, Wolves, and ended up dropping two points against them after a goal from Wolves in stoppage time. Every time Arsenal drop points against clubs, it gives a little bit of extra motivation for Pep Guardiola and his squad, who will look to close that gap.While neither club is playing at the top of their game right now, I expect City to smell blood in the water as Arsenal have a history of struggling during the winter months. This is a critical match for Manchester City and while Newcastle looked fantastic against Qarabag on the road in UCL, this should be a big three points for City.Bet on Manchester City vs. Newcastle at BetMGM using the promo code CBSSPORTS, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if their qualifying wager loses:Goals galore in Newcastle matchesWhile Manchester City can be a tough nut to crack defensively, if anyone was going to do it right now, it would be Newcastle with the form they are in. They just traveled to Azerbaijan to play the Azerbaijani giants, Qarabag in UCL play earlier this week and demolished them 6-1. Anthony Gordan picked up four goals, while Jacob Murphy and Malick Thiaw also found the scoresheet. This is a club which has gone Over its goal total in the last six matches. They've also seen both teams scoring in each of those six matches as well. The pitch will be littered with goal-scoring threats, and I'm expecting both clubs to find the back of the net.\n            ",

The Cowboys made sure to give Williams a deal in line with his market value before he hit free agency to avoid having to replace his strong production from 2025. Williams rushed for 1,201 yards and 11 touchdowns on 252 carries for the Cowboys in 2025 -- reaching career-highs in all three categories. He also caught 35 passes out of the backfield for 137 yards and two touchdowns, providing Dak Prescott with a comfortable check down target. \nWith Williams' deal done, the Cowboys can shift their focus to their other free agents, with wide receiver George Pickens the most notable potential departure. Pickens also had a career-year in his first season in Dallas, tallying 1,429 receiving yards and nine touchdowns to lead the team in both categories. Pickens will be hoping to get a contract that pays him like the top-end receivers in the NFL, but it remains to be seen if Dallas is willing to make such a long-term offer with CeeDee Lamb already on a 4-year, $136 million deal (with $100 million guaranteed). If the two sides can't agree to a new deal, Lamb would be a prime franchise tag target for the Cowboys at a price of $28 million for the 2026 season. \nThe Cowboys have just over two weeks to get a Pickens deal done, but with Williams out of the way it's one fewer concern for Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones and the Cowboys ahead of the March 9 opening for the legal tampering period to free agency. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        LAWRENCE, Kansas — Lost in the sauce of the never-ending Darryn Peterson discourse hides the fact that it's late February, and Kansas still doesn't know quite what makes it tick yet.Bill Self likes this team, but he sure wasn't tickled pink by how his group handled Saturday's test. Unranked Cincinnati waltzed into Allen Fieldhouse and drubbed No. 8 Kansas 84-68 handing the Jayhawks its first double-digit home loss to an unranked opponent since 1993, per CBS Sports research. \"We played soft,\" Self said matter-of-factly.Peterson's spotty availability status has become the story. It's often been distilled down to an argument like this: When Peterson plays, Kansas is  a national championship contender, but…Well, Peterson played a full allotment of 32 minutes against Cincinnati, the most minutes in two weeks, and yet, Kansas' home fans were dipping for the exits long before Saturday's final buzzer sounded.\nThere's been a fog (or Phog?) clouding the reality that Kansas is still in tinkering mode, while numerous other national championship hopefuls have cleared those hurdles and have elevated into a new zip code with March looming.Meanwhile, Kansas' hot-spots emerged for the world to see.KU big man Flory Bidunga has been one of the fiercest defensive players this season, but Cincinnati found real cracks in the armor on the edges of this Kansas defense. Cincinnati forward Baba Miller scored eight of his 12 first-half points when Bidunga was not guarding him. Big man Moustapha Thiam gave redshirt freshman Bryson Tiller the work early and often on the way to a 28-point, eight-rebound showing on his 20th birthday.\n\"That's one heck of a birthday present,\" Cincinnati coach Wes Miller said. \"We all got to feel like it was our birthday tonight. I mean, I didn't know he had 28. I knew he was playing great, but I thought he was terrific.\"\nThe other side of the aisle was not feeling like having a slice of birthday cake.\"I didn't think our bigs played very big today,\" Self said.That's a grave indictment for a national championship hopeful because teams like Michigan and Florida are driven by their enormous front-lines. Bidunga is generously listed at 6-foot-10 and 235 pounds. Tiller is 6-foot-11 but doesn't always play like it. A depth option like 7-footer Paul Mbiya is not part of this rotation right now. Is Kansas big enough to win this thing in the supersized era that is college basketball? On Saturday, it sure wasn't. Cincinnati ripped down 14 offensive rebounds, much to Self's chagrin.Kansas' offense was also entirely rudderless for long stretches. The Jayhawks managed just 1.04 points per possession and managed just two assists over a 15-minute span in a second half gone awry. Peterson scored 17 of the most invisible points. Melvin Council, long the emotional leader of this group, went 3-for-13 from the field. Outside of some empty-side pick-and-rolls for Bidunga to go Turbo Smash on the rim, Kansas' offense found no easy answers against a Cincinnati group that is a top-10 defense.\n\"It's terrible, we didn't play well,\" Self said. \"Against good teams, you're not going to score fast. You're not going to score on the first side (of the floor). We don't have that type of team, and we didn't screen, and we didn't do a lot of things the way that I would hope that we would do it. I got to do a better job of getting us to do. We've shown that we can do it at times, but we certainly didn't do it against a team that demands it being done because they're so sound.\"There isn't any time to lick wounds. No. 2 Houston will saunter into Lawrence on Monday, and the Cougars can steal some of Cincinnati's homework.Houston could out-rebound the Jayhawks by 21, not 11, if Kansas isn't careful. Houston's defense — which is even better than Cincinnati's — could wreck havoc against Kansas if this offense doesn't snap out of the stagnation.\n\"It just wasn't a very tough team today like we're capable of being,\" Self said. \"Hopefully, we get that mindset corrected here. We'll see…\"Kansas does not lose games at home. This is just the 23rd time that a Self-coached club has lost in this basketball cathedral. Back-to-back home losses feel unfathomable.\"Bad, brutal and it sucks,\" Council said. \"We are supposed to defend homecourt always. Losing to UConn, now Cincinnati. We can't do it no more.\"\nLet the tinkering begin because this team has plenty to learn about itself.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of college basketball's longest streaks in the AP poll era ended Saturday following Cincinnati's 84-68 thumping of eighth-ranked Kansas, a jolting setback for a Jayhawks team who were projected as a 3-seed in the East by the NCAA Tournament selection committee a few hours prior. The Jayhawks hadn't lost to an unranked team at home by 10 or more points since 1993, which spanned a nation-leading 425 consecutive games. Cincinnati 7-footer Moustapha Thiam poured in a career-high 28 points and helped the Bearcats pull away down the stretch with a 3-pointer with 7:35 to play after Kansas had moved within a possession.\"We were just awful today defensively,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"They were great. Their bigs dominated. Their guards, we didn't pressure them and they got what they wanted to. ... it was a combination of defensive rebounding, their guards getting to where they want to go. But their bigs, they destroyed us.\"It was a particularly disheartening performance given the Jayhawks' play since overcoming a 1-2 start in Big 12 play to win nine of their last 10 games. Expecting another high-end outing Saturday afternoon coming off recent victories over BYU, Texas Tech and Utah, Kansas failed to land body blows in the second half to a Bearcats team that pulled to .500 this season in conference play.\nThe 16-point home loss was the Jayhawks' largest to an unranked opponent since 1973, besting a 15-point setback to Long Beach State in 1993 when Kansas was ranked No. 1.This marks the fourth-largest home loss Kansas has suffered under Self with all the others coming against ranked competition. Cincinnati made 12 of 21 attempts from behind the 3-point line and sent Jayhawks fans to the exits early with a home showdown against Houston looming on Monday night.Lost by 25 to No. 8 Texas on Jan. 2, 2021Lost by 23 to No. 14 TCU on Jan. 21, 2023Lost by 18 to No. 12 Kentucky on Jan. 29, 2022The Jayhawks were one of five Big 12 teams to receive a top-16 seed in Saturday's NCAA March Madness bracket preview. They'll try and regroup next week with the first of two pivotal contests against the conference's top teams.Self said his team played \"soft\" and had lacked energy on the glass after getting out-rebounded by Cincinnati, 40-29.\n\"We respected the opponent, but the bottom line is, we didn't bring it as a unit from an energy standpoint, like you got to when they're good,\" Self said. \"I mean, we played a NCAA Tournament team today. There's no doubt about that. They've had their moments this season where they've been inconsistent and not as good, but they were great today.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The No. 1 seeds in Saturday's NCAA March Madness Bracket preview were Michigan, Duke, Arizona and Iowa State. While the first three were largely expected, Iowa State's inclusion on the top line was anything but a foregone conclusion.      Ultimately, the Cyclones (23-3, 10-3 Big 12) got the nod over UConn and Houston from the NCAA Tournament selection committee ahead of their Saturday trip to play BYU. UConn landed as the top No. 2 seed, despite its unseemly home loss to Creighton on Wednesday. Houston claimed the second No. 2 seed while Illinois and Purdue rounded out the No. 2 seed line.      With just over three weeks to go until Selection Sunday, the picture will change and evolve over the days ahead. In fact, Saturday's results will almost assuredly impact the picture. But the bracket preview, which covers the top 16 teams, offers an idea of how things are shaping up as the regular season nears its end.      A whopping 10 teams from the Big Ten and Big 12 — five from each league — made the top 16. The ACC and SEC each produced two representatives, while the Big East and WCC each had one team make the top 16.      \nHere is the full rundown of the top 16 from the bracket preview followed by the big takeaways.

Iowa State boasts wins over No. 17 St. John's, No. 8 Kansas and No. 2 Houston. The Cyclones suffered unflattering road losses against Cincinnati and TCU, but those are classified as Quad 1 defeats and the committee didn't seem bothered by them. While our expert panelists believed the nod for the final No. 1 seed should have gone to Houston, which rates slightly better than ISU in both the results-based and predictive metrics that appear on official NCAA team sheets, the Cougars don't have the same sort of blockbuster wins as Iowa State. Their losses were all in close games against elite opposition (Tennessee, Texas Tech and Iowa State). But again, who you beat seems to be far more important than who beat you.      \nIn fact, committee chair Keith Gill pointed directly to the quality of Iowa State's best wins -- including its head-to-head victory over Houston -- in rationalizing the Cyclones as a No. 1 seed.The \"big-time win\" methodology also explained why UConn edged Houston for the top spot on the No. 2 seed line. Despite their ugly fall against Creighton this week, the Huskies boast victories over No. 10 Illinois, No. 8 Kansas and No. 12 Florida, which is an impressive haul of high-end wins.            Texas Tech takes a hitTexas Tech landed as a No. 4 seed in the bracket preview. However, Gill shared that the Red Raiders were in line for a No. 3 seed before it was revealed that star forward JT Toppin suffered a season-ending ACL tear. \nThe reigning Big 12 Player of the Year suffered the injury in the Red Raiders' loss at Arizona State on Tuesday. Saturday's home game against Kansas State will be the first post-Toppin data point for the committee to digest. Depending on how the before/after comparison of life without Toppin goes, it stands to reason that the Red Raiders could get hit even harder on Selection Sunday.      A stacked Midwest      Though it will almost certainly unfold differently on Selection Sunday, the sight of a stacked Midwest region in the bracket preview was jarring. It also underscored the challenge the selection committee faces in adhering to stringent bracketing principles at a time when the majority of at-large bids are going to teams from a small handful of conferences.      If this were the real bracket, fans of Michigan, Houston and Florida would understandably be disgruntled to see such tough competition standing in their path to a Final Four. But the composition of the preview's top 16 technically met the the committee's threshold for competitive balance.

Though the picture will immediately begin to change as new results roll in, the exercise provided some interesting fodder for college basketball fans to digest. Among the biggest takeaways from the bracket preview was just how stacked the Midwest was. Again, this will all shift before Selection Sunday on March 15, but it was shocking to see a single region containing No. 1 overall seed Michigan, No. 6 overall seed Houston and No. 9 overall seed Florida. \n        \n            \n                Michigan earns No. 1 overall seed, Iowa State a big winner from NCAA Tournament bracket preview\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe sight underscored the challenges the selection committee faces while adhering to NCAA bracketing principles in the era of conference consolidation. All three rate as top-6 teams at KenPom, and our expert panel unanimously projected that the Cougars would be a No. 1 seed in the bracket preview. Three members of our six-person panel also had Florida as a No. 2 seed. \nNot only was Houston not a No. 1 seed, it also was not the first No. 2 seed in the bracket preview. That distinction belonged to UConn. Subsequently, official bracketing principles led the committee down a path that resulted in a stacked Midwest Regional.

Here are two major need-to-knows that will set the table:  —The committee seeks to separate the first four teams from the same conference into different regions, which is why No. 2 seeds Purdue and Illinois weren't placed with Michigan in the Midwest. —Since UConn slotted as the best-ranked No. 2 seed, the Huskies would not have been permitted to play in the same region as the best-ranked No. 1 seed. \nAs a result, the committee likely determined — with the help of its software that flags those issues — that sending Houston to the Midwest was unavoidable.  What about Florida? Once the committee started bracketing the No. 3 seeds, it naturally placed the best-ranked No. 3 seed (Florida) in the same region as the No. 1 overall seed (Michigan) in order to follow the established \"s-curve\" format. No official \"flags\" would have appeared for that decision since Florida (SEC), Houston (Big 12) and Michigan (Big Ten) each play in different conferences. Moving on, the second No. 3 seed, Kansas (Big 12), would have slotted in to the East region below Duke (ACC) and Illinois (Big Ten) with no conference separation issues. \nFellow No. 3 seed Nebraska (Big Ten) would naturally have gone to the West. But since Purdue (Big Ten) was already there on the No. 2 seed line, it seems the Cornhuskers were deemed a better fit for the South alongside Iowa State (Big 12) and UConn (Big East). This is likely why Gonzaga ended up in the West, despite the fact that the s-curve would have sent the Bulldogs to the South as the worst-ranked No. 3 seed. \n        \n            \n                Inside the committee room: What it's like to pick, seed and build the NCAA Tournament bracket\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen it came to bracketing the No. 4 seeds, there was already a Big Ten team and a Big 12 team in every region, which meant there was no choice but to place Michigan State and Texas Tech in regions with conference foes. \nWith the Big Ten and Big 12 well-positioned to claim a hefty chunk of the best seeds in the 2026 NCAA Tournament, these are the real issues the selection committee will likely navigate. The leagues combined to produce 10 of the 16 squads in the bracket preview.  Pursuing balance While the preview's Midwest is obviously stacked, the potential competitive imbalance was technically slender enough that it passed NCAA protocols. Here's what the committee's official principles state: \"After the top four seed lines have been assigned, the committee will review the relative strengths of the regions by adding the \"true seed\" numbers in each region to determine if any severe numerical imbalance exists. Preferably, no more than six points should separate the lowest and highest total.\"   \nIf you tally the \"true\" seeds of the top four teams from the \"toughest\" region (Midwest), you get Michigan (1) + Houston (6) + Florida (9) + Virginia (16) = 32. If you tally the \"true\" seeds of the top four teams from the \"weakest\" region (West), you get Arizona (3) + Purdue (8) + Gonzaga (12) + Michigan State (14) = 37. That falls within a range of six points, which means it met the committee's threshold for what is considered balance. \nSelection committee chair Keith Gill revealed during the bracket preview that the committee initially placed No. 14 overall seed Michigan State in the Midwest and Virginia in the West. That would have triggered a flag notifying the committee about competitive imbalance.  In that scenario, the difference between the cumulative true seed values of the top four teams in the Midwest and West was greater than six. Thus it led to a swap of Virginia and Michigan State. Down the bracket If you thought that was complicated, it was only the start.  Amid conference consolidation and the proliferation of nonconference matchups between high-major schools, the committee will face additional challenges in avoiding regular season rematches as it brackets a full field in the weeks ahead. While the committee will still be strident in avoiding first round rematches, some second round rematches may be unavoidable. That's why the CBS Sports Bracketology model occasionally produces second round rematches between teams that have already played. \n\n        \n            \n                How more marquee matchups in college basketball will impact NCAA Tournament bracketing process, seeding\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen multiple teams on a seed line are from the same conference, there are times when the only alternative to avoiding a potential conference rematch is to create a potential nonconference rematch. NCAA bracketing principles permit games between conference teams in the second round, so long as the teams in question played each other just once before the NCAA Tournament. For conference teams that met twice prior to the NCAA Tournament, principles state they should not meet prior to the Sweet 16. If the teams played three times, bracketing principles state they should not play before the Elite Eight. With regard to rematches of nonconference games, principles state that they should be avoided \"in the First Four and first round.\" The committee will also \"attempt to avoid\" nonconference rematches in the second round. But the committee prioritizes keeping teams on their natural seed line over changing their seed line for the sake of avoiding a rematch.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State and Ohio State will meet for the first time on the hardwood this season Sunday on CBS in a pivotal Big Ten showdown with NCAA Tournament seeding and conference championship implications on the line. The two teams enter the day having won earlier in the week -- Michigan State over UCLA and Ohio State over Wisconsin, respectively -- setting up what should be a terrific matchup from East Lansing.Michigan State has been tough to beat on its homecourt this season, but it has not been infallible. It is 13-2 in games played in the Breslin Center, with both losses coming to teams ranked inside the top five. That should inspire at least a little confidence in the Buckeyes, who are in desperate need of stringing together some momentum after alternating between wins and losses in their last nine outings.Ohio State vs. Michigan State: Need to knowBig Ten title hopes: Michigan State enters Sunday 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings and likely needs to run the regular-season table to be in contention for a conference title. Given the way the Wolverines have played, it seems farfetched, but the Spartans can't lose sight of the goal against a Buckeyes team that could be easy to overlook if not taken seriously. Consistently inconsistent: Ohio State has alternated between winning and losing in its last nine games dating back more than a month, proving to be consistent only in its inconsistency. A win Sunday would be its first two-game winning streak since mid-January. It is coming off an 86-69 home win over Wisconsin.Fearsome Fears: Michigan State guard Jeremy Fears Jr. leads all of college basketball in assists per game (9.3) and also leads his team in minutes and points per game with 31.6 and 15.1, respectively. He's made a significant jump in production from last season and is coming off his fourth consecutive double-double in which he had 16 points and 10 assists in an 82-59 win over UCLA.\nWhere to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan State liveDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, MichiganTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium  Ohio State vs. Michigan State prediction, pickOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook\nMichigan State's 13-2 at home this season and 7-5-1 against the spread as home favorites. I'm taking the Spartans to win and would probably lay the points with them as they prep for their penultimate home game of the season. The way Fears has played of late should inspire confidence, but more than that, this Michigan State team has leveled up defensively, too. If they can find a way to slow Bruce Thornton they can win -- and perhaps handily. Pick: Michigan State -9 \n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            MSU -9\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Ohio St.\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There will be superstars all over the ice on Sunday morning when the United States and Canada face off in the gold medal game at the Winter Olympics. Which of these two rivals has more firepower? The answer to that question may be what determines the winner.The Canadians probably have more marquee names than the Americans. Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon have four Hart Trophy wins between them, and they're probably the two best hockey players in the world. That's a nice luxury for Canada, but it's not like the U.S. is lacking for star power at the top of its lineup.We've already seen what Quinn Hughes can do in big moments with his overtime goal against Sweden, and reigning Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck is capable of winning a game on his own between the pipes. That's without even mentioning the one-two punch of two-way centers the Americans have in their top six forward group.\n        \n            \n                Where to watch Team USA vs. Canada: Prediction, start time for men's hockey gold medal game between rivals\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Canada holds the edge when it comes to the elite of the elite, the U.S. has the depth to take down a country that has won nine Olympic gold medals in its history. Here are the 10 best players in Sunday's gold medal game (8:10 a.m. ET).\n10. Zach Werenski | D | USAThe U.S. defensive group is deepest and most talented in the tournament, and while Quinn Hughes gets a lot of justified attention, Zach Werenski is right there with him as one of the best defenders in the world. Since the start of the 2024-25 season, Werenski has tallied 144 points, behind only Cale Makar among defensemen.Werenski also boasts a plus-34 five-on-five goal differential in that span, per Natural Stat Trick. At the 2026 Olympics, we've seen the best parts of Werenski's game, from clean zone exits to the frequent creation of dangerous scoring chances.9. Mitch Marner | LW | CanadaMarner is the rare playmaking winger who is capable of driving play on his own, and he can play in all situations. In this tournament, we've already gotten a clear picture of what Marner can do with the puck on his stick. In the Canadians' overtime win over Czechia in the quarterfinals, Marner pulled off an incredible individual effort to score the game-winner.\nA 2023 Selke Trophy finalist, Marner is also a force in the defensive end. His line with Mark Stone on the other wing could create problems for the American offense.8. Macklin Celebrini | LW | CanadaSome may think this ranking is a little high and a little premature, but Celebrini has just been that good, both in these Olympics and his young NHL career. Celebrini has completely revived a rebuilding San Jose Sharks franchise, and he's in the Hart Trophy conversation with 81 points, more than double his next closest teammate.In Milan, Canadian coach Jon Cooper put Celebrini next to McDavid, and that bold move has paid off in spades. Celebrini leads the Olympics with five goals, and he's second to McDavid in points with 10.\n7. Auston Matthews | C | USAMatthews is one of the best goal-scorers in hockey. His 427 goals since his rookie campaign in 2016-17 are the most in the league with the next closest player sitting 20 goals behind him. Matthews has a deceptive and powerful release that helps him beat goalies with ease, but he's not a one-trick pony. Matthews' defensive game has earned him Selke Trophy votes in each of the last six seasons.When Matthews is on the ice, the Americans are capable of scoring from anywhere in the offensive zone.6. Jack Eichel | C | USAOne of the best two-way centers in the NHL, Eichel has been making plays all over the ice for the U.S. through its first five games. Eichel can excel in every situation, and he's currently on pace for a 111-point season with the Vegas Golden Knights. Coach Mike Sullivan has leaned on Eichel a lot at these Olympics, and that won't stop now.\nI'd expect Eichel to be matched up against Connor McDavid whenever possible, and while that is a big challenge for any player, the American center is capable of holding his own.5. Connor Hellebuyck | G | USAHellebuyck has a strong argument to be the best goalie in the league. He's a three-time Vezina Trophy winner and the reigning NHL MVP. When Hellebuyck is on his game, there's little that an opponent can do. Hellebuyck is 6-foot-4 and rarely out of position, making him incredibly tough to beat, and he has been great for the Americans in Milan.Over the last three seasons, Hellebuyck has saved 77.5 goals above average, per Natural Stat Trick. The next closest goalie is Andrei Vasilevskiy at 52.2. Canada's Jordan Binnington is below water at -6.54.\n4. Quinn Hughes | D | USAWhat Quinn Hughes brings to this U.S. team was evident in that dramatic win over Sweden in the quarterfinals. Despite playing big minutes, Hughes was a workhorse in overtime, right up until he ended the game by firing a laser beam past Jacob Markstrom. Hughes is one of the best skaters in the world, and he's able to pair that with his high hockey IQ.The U.S. can deploy Hughes in any situation, and I have a hunch Canada will see a lot of him on Sunday morning. Hughes is one of a few defensemen who can skate with Canada's biggest stars and not look overmatched.3. Cale Makar | D | CanadaA two-time Norris Trophy winner (who is gunning to make it three in 2026), Makar is a dynamic player who impacts games in a similar fashion as Hughes. Makar is special, especially with the puck on his stick, as he uses his skating, stickhandling and vision to make plays that few players can.\nSince his rookie campaign in 2019-20, Makar leads all defensemen with 485 points, which also ranks 16th among all skaters. Makar is a threat to make a big play from anywhere on the ice -- from a stretch pass springing a teammate to wheeling around the offensive zone.2. Nathan MacKinnon | C | CanadaIt's unfair that, in addition to Connor McDavid, the Canadians also have MacKinnon at their disposal. He would be the best player on any other team in these Olympics, and he is playing at a Hart Trophy level for the Avalanche in 2025-26. MacKinnon leads the NHL with 40 goals, and he has seven points in this tournament.MacKinnon is a versatile player who can win with speed, power or some combination of both. However you want to play, he's more than happy to beat you.\n1. Connor McDavid | C | CanadaMcDavid is the best player in the world, and as if he needed to prove that fact, he leads the tournament in assists (11) and points (13). Since his rookie season in 2015-26, McDavid leads the NHL in assists (783) and points (1,178), and he ranks fifth in goals (395). He's also a three-time Hart Trophy winner, a Conn Smythe Trophy winner, a five-time Art Ross Trophy winner and Maurice Richard Trophy winner.One of the few things missing from McDavid's trophy case is a gold medal, and he seems determined to get one of those in Milan. Slowing him down will be a tall task, even for the Americans' elite defense.So who wins the 2026 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey final between USA and Canada, and what are the best bets for this matchup? Visit SportsLine now to see the 2026 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey picks and best bets from a hockey insider, and find out.\n            ",

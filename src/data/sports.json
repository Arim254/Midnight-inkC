    "body": "\n        The latest DraftKings promo code gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, and with a 14-game NBA slate on Wednesday, there are plenty of ways to take advantage of this latest offer. One of the Wednesday's top matchups features the Philadelphia 76ers hosting the New York Knicks in an Eastern Conference battle, and although the 76ers are favored in the latest Wednesday NBA odds, the SportsLine Projection Model projects the Knicks to win 60% of simulations, making the Knicks (+114) one of its Wednesday NBA best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook in a 7:30 p.m. ET matchup. The over/under for Knicks vs. 76ers is 224.5 points. The model also sees an opportunity to back another underdog to win on Wednesday, seeing value in the Atlanta Hawks at +164 odds to defeat the Charlotte Hornets. The Hawks win in 47% of the model's simulations, compared to the implied odds of 37.9%. One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball bet for Missouri vs. Texas A&M at 9 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters the week before the NBA All-Star break on a sizzling 38-17 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Wednesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookKnicks (+114) to defeat the 76ers Hawks (+164) to defeat the HornetsTexas A&M (-6.5) vs. Missouri (-112)Combining the three picks into a Wednesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +969 (risk $100 to win $969). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):\nKnicks (+114) to defeat the 76ers The Knicks are coming off a stunning 137-134 overtime loss to the Pacers on Tuesday, and with Wednesday being their final game before the NBA All-Star break, you'd imagine they'd be additionally motivated to move past that loss and enter the break with a victory. The Knicks are 9-2 over their last 11 games, which includes a 112-109 win at Philadelphia on Jan. 24. Meanwhile, the 76ers have lost two of their last three games. The Knicks are 8-3 over the last three seasons against the 76ers, which doesn't even include a six-game victory over them in the playoffs two years ago. The model projects the Knicks to win in 60% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Knicks to win at DraftKings here:Hawks (+164) to defeat the HornetsThere's no denying how well the Hornets have been playing lately, as their nine-game winning streak was snapped by the Pistons, who have the best record in the Eastern Conference, on Monday. However, despite a 26-29 record this season, the Hawks are 6-4 over their last 10 games and are currently playing some of their best basketball of the season. The Hawks travel to the Hornets, and ironically enough, both the Hawks and Hornets have better road records than home marks this season. Atlanta is 16-14 away, and Charlotte is 11-14 at home this season. The model projects the Hawks to win in 47% of simulations, compared to the implied odds of 37.9%, making this value too good to pass up on for Wednesday NBA bets. Back the Hawks to win at DraftKings here:Texas A&M (-6.5) vs. Missouri (-112)\"This feels like a good time to buy low on Texas A&M,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"The Aggies fought to the wire against Alabama, but that 100-97 loss appeared to take a lot out of them. A&M had no juice in the first half versus Florida, scoring just 19 points. They did wake up and score 48 in the second half, but it was too little, too late. This is a bad matchup for a Missouri team that struggles with turnovers and guarding the three-point line. I think Texas A&M rebounds from two straight losses with a big win at home here.\" Back Texas A&M to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Wednesday?You've seen some of the model's Wednesday best bets.

From snowboarding events to ice hockey, there is not a lack of events to tune into.Chloe Kim is chasing history, looking to be the first halfpipe snowboarder to three-peat at the Olympics and is looking to defend her title, winning the world championship last season. The 25-year-old Team USA snowboarder has a good chance, as she topped qualifications on Wednesday. Maddie Mastro and Bea Kim are two other Americans in the final looking for a medal.Downhill champion Breezy Johnson is also looking for another medal and will compete in the Super-G on Thursday.\nAlso, the United States men's hockey team will begin its quest for its first podium since earning the silver medal at the Vancouver Games in 2010 and -- of course -- that golden \"Miracle on Ice\" finish at Lake Placid, New York, in 1980. Thursday's preliminary game will be against Latvia.The Milan Cortina Games will run through Sunday, Feb. 22, and in total of 119 events will take place with 245 medals handed out to the athletes. Fans can find the action on NBC and their streaming service Peacock, with an account or a cable login.\nThe Winter Games have eight main sports, with 16 disciplines.

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag.

    "body": "\n        The speed part of speedskating isn't the easiest thing to translate to a TV screen.When men and women race in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints at the Summer Olympics, their raw athletic prowess is obvious. It pops through a broadcast. Legs pumping and arms churning, eight racers dart their hearts out mere feet from one another as a sea of humanity of tens of thousands strong shrieks from their guts. It's obvious and irresistible theater, and the speed (thanks to advanced technology and cameras that move alongside the sprinters) is tangible even while watching from the comfort of your couch. Speedskating — sprinting's Winter Olympics analog — doesn't carry that widespread appeal every four years, when it gets a February main-stage moment. The skaters look fast, but how fast are they really going? It can be hard to discern. And they're on skates, after all, so the training and endurance that it takes to be an Olympic-level competitor is somewhat muted because they're zipping around on ice. Beyond that, racers don unitards with hoods over their heads (for aerodynamics) and wear protective goggles, too.\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFair or not, it's hard for speedskating to cultivate most of its best into highly marketable athletes who can truly break into the mainstream.\nJordan Stolz might be too great to be held back, though. Niche sport be damned, the United States looks like it has its next Olympic superstar. The 21-year-old from Wisconsin made his 2026 Olympic debut on Wednesday in Milan and exceeded the considerable hype that trailed in his wake going into these Games. Stolz took gold in the 1,000-meter race, and as if that wasn't enough, he did it in both come-from-behind fashion and record-setting style. Stolz's superhuman strength is how he doesn't wear down as races go on. As other elite speedskaters see their times unavoidably weighted by critical seconds the deeper they get into their races, Stolz's endurance is a phenomenal separator.Watch how he used his abilities to take gold on Wednesday.\nStolz's 1:06.28 blitz was .50 seconds ahead of his chief rival, Jenning de Boo from the Netherlands. \nLike so many speed contests in the Olympics, the difference in first vs. second or second vs. third can be one, two or three-hundredths of a second. Stolz's time was a laughable half-second faster than de Boo's, marking the largest gap between a gold and silver Olympics finish in the 1,000 since 1984. Stolz also broke the previous Olympic record by almost a full second. He didn't set the world record on Wednesday, though. And that's OK. He already has that, too. He set it at the world championships in January 2024. Get ready, because Wednesday was the start of what could be an all-time Olympic career for a guy who grew up with a huge pond in his backyard, would practice deep into the frigid, black winter nights and is already turning his origin story into a quintessential Olympic fairytale.\nIf you missed Stolz's race in real time on Wednesday, that's understandable. It was in the middle of the afternoon in the middle of the work week. NBC will re-air it on Wednesday night. Make the time to watch, because this is your official announcement to get on the Stolz train. He's got one gold and is going for four. Still to come for Stolz: the 500-meter, 1,500-meter and the must-see chaos race that is the mass start. He may well leave Milan with four medals around his neck, and they could all be first-place finishes. \nHe's practically already at the Michael Phelps, Katie Ledecky level in that it would be stunning to see him finish in any place other than the top podium position. That's because Stolz claimed first in the world championships in 2023 and 2024 in the 500, 1,000 and 1,500 meters. Everyone on the ice fears him. And he is unquestionably the biggest breakout star of these Winter Olympics. The sport has had some legends over the decades, to be sure. Eric Heiden changed American speedskating forever when he won five golds at the 1980 Olympic Games in Lake Placid. Bonnie Blair, Apolo Ohno and Shani Davis reached the pinnacle in the ensuing decades. Stolz is next, and is poised to perhaps be the greatest to ever do it. He gets his next chance at a legacy-defining Olympics with the men's 500-meter race on Saturday.\n            ",

In that post, Vonn said her injury -- a complex tibia fracture -- would require multiple surgeries to repair, and on Wednesday she offered another update following her third surgery with a photo from her hospital bed in Italy. \n\nI had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I'm making progress and while it is slow, I know I'll be ok. Thankful for all of the incredible medical staff, friends, family, who have been by my side and the beautiful outpouring of love and support from people around the world. Also, huge congrats to my teammates and all of the Team USA athletes who are out there inspiring me and giving me something to cheer for. ❤️🤍💙In the photo, the extent of the injury is evident in the amount of bracing on Vonn's leg. However, even in the face of what seems likely to be a career-ending injury, Vonn continues to express gratitude and appreciation for fans supporting her journey back to competition. \nVonn's return to the Olympics saw her return to the top of the downhill standings this season, but a crash in Switzerland a week before the games threatened to derail her comeback after she suffered a torn ACL in her left knee. Vonn was able to get cleared by doctors to continue competing, and after successfully completing her training runs, she was still a podium contender heading into Sunday's downhill. \n        \n            \n                Lindsey Vonn has 'no regrets' after Olympics crash as skiing figures defend her decision to race on torn ACL\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarly in her run, Vonn clipped a gate as she came over a jump that caused her to get off balance and led to the crash that made for a cruel ending to an inspiring comeback bid. As she explained in her first post, she was just five inches too far inside on her line, pushing herself to the limit as always trying to get every edge possible. \nThat willingness to push boundaries made Vonn a legend, and her resilience in the face of injuries and heartache continues to make her a beloved figure in American sport. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the NBA season past the halfway point, fantasy managers can no longer afford to wait for roles to sort themselves out. Trades, injuries and shifting team priorities have already reshaped rotations across the league, creating new opportunities for players stepping into expanded workloads. Identifying these changes before they fully register in box scores is often the difference between a playoff berth and an early exit. From young guards like Jaden Ivey and Nolan Traore to veterans such as Brook Lopez, here are several players whose evolving situations make them strong candidates to deliver meaningful fantasy value down the stretch.Jaden Ivey, BullsIvey began the season sidelined with injury trouble but managed to work his way into serviceable form through the last couple of months while he played out of a bench role for the Pistons. However, after being traded to the Bulls in early February, he has started in three straight games, averaging 12.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.7 steals over that span. He should continue to see notable playing time with his new squad and will likely continue to deliver good value as he builds up a rhythm. GG Jackson, GrizzliesSince the departure of Jaren Jackson via trade, GG has benefited by taking on a starting role and a boost in playing time. He is averaging 12.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks in 26.8 minutes per game over four straight starts. He is also shooting an impressive 53.3 percent from the field over that span, with 2.0 three-pointers made per outing. He should continue to handle an expanded role and is likely to increase, or at least maintain, his production as he gets more comfortable. While this is his third NBA season, he has not had too many consistent opportunities but has shown promise when offered the chance. Nique Clifford, KingsClifford has started in six of the last nine games, including the two most recent outings, as he is stepping up while his squad deals with injury trouble. Additionally, the fact that the Kings sit last place in the West with nearly zero chance of making a run at the playoffs suggests that the squad will continue to lean towards allowing more opportunity for their rookie to explore his game. Clifford is averaging 12.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.1 steals, with 1.8 made three-pointers per game over the aforementioned nine-game span. He also dropped a season-high 30 points in the game before last. \nNolan Traore, NetsTraore has started the last seven games and is averaging 11.0 points, 2.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists, while shooting 48.4 percent from the field in 27.4 minutes per game over that span. With his squad sitting well out of a play-in spot and showing a clear focus on development, it is likely that the 19-year-old continues to see a substantial amount of playing time the rest of the way. He produced his first career double-double in his most recent outing and topped the 20-point mark twice in his last eight appearances. Gui Santos, WarriorsSantos has started in four straight and six of the last nine games, averaging 13.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.9 blocks, while shooting a blistering 60.3 percent from the field over that span. Jimmy Butler going down with an injury for the rest of the season is a primary factor in there being more playing time to go around within the Warriors' lineup. So far, Santos has done a great job in identifying himself as a prime candidate to handle a bigger role down the stretch of the season.  Brook Lopez, ClippersIt is surprising to find an 18-year vet on this list, but Lopez is back in the driver's seat at the center position, as his new squad traded away their star center, Ivica Zubac. Despite his relatively advanced age, Lopez has shown that he is still up to the task of filling a key role, as he is averaging 8.0 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.5 blocks over four consecutive starts, while shooting 41.7 percent from long range over that span. His three-point shooting and shot-blocking have been the driving factors in his success for many years now. As long as he can continue to maintain production in those areas, he will likely hang on to the starting job. \nMoussa Diabate, HornetsDiabate began the season in a bench role but earned himself a promotion through his persistent hustle. He has started in 22 consecutive appearances, averaging 8.8 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 blocks over that span and is in line to remain the go-to option at center for his up-and-coming squad. It is noteworthy that he is facing a multi-game suspension for his part in an on-court scuffle in the Hornets' last game, but he will be back in action by February 24, and should pick up where he left off. Dylan Cardwell, KingsCardwell did a fantastic job in proving himself as a strong contributor while Domantas Sabonis was sidelined with injury trouble. Since then, Cardwell has continued to provide strong production off the bench and is averaging 6.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.8 blocks over the last 10 games. He is also up to three double-doubles on the season. The first-year big man should see plenty of opportunity the rest of the way and is more than likely to continue to thrive as a rebounder and shot-blocker. Jalen Smith, BullsSmith is in line for a significant boost after the Bulls parted ways with Nikola Vucevic. Unfortunately, he has missed four of the last six games due to injury trouble, but he has started in eight of his last nine appearances, averaging 13.2 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 0.8 steals per game over that span. Smith has shown flashes of great potential over the last couple of years but has not had the opportunity to fully spread his wings. However, it is likely that he gets that chance through the rest of this season, once returns to action. \nScoot Henderson, Trail BlazersHenderson made his season debut on February 6, and delivered 11 points, five rebounds, nine assists and one steal in just 21 minutes of action. He sat out the next game but followed up with 12 points, two rebounds, seven assists and a steal in the Trail Blazers' most recent outing. The third-year guard still has a way to go in order to meet the expectations of a top-three draft pick but early indications show that he is ready to provide a notable impact for his squad as they battle to maintain a shot at the playoffs this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Few voices in golf carry more weight than that of Rory McIlroy, so when he weighs in on whatever the latest hot topic among golf fans and pundits might be, folks tend to listen. As McIlroy arrived stateside for his first PGA Tour event of the 2026 season at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he was asked about the latest round of debate regarding The Players Championship and where it falls in the hierarchy of golf's biggest events. The Players has established itself as the premier event on the PGA Tour schedule outside of the major championships, leading some to believe it should be considered a \"major\" given its quality of field and the stiff challenge presented by the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy has long been a strong supporter of The Players as an elite event on the calendar -- even noting that he believes it has a better identity than the PGA Championship -- but he does not buy into the idea that it should be elevated alongside that tournament, the Masters, the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\"The Players is one of the best golf tournaments in the world. I don't think anyone disputes that or argues that. From a player perspective, it's amazing. From an on-site fan experience, it's amazing. It's an amazing golf course, location, venue. \"But I don't -- like again, I'm a traditionalist, I'm a historian of the game. We have four major championships. If you want to see what five major championships looks like, look at the women's game. I don't know how well that's went for them. But it's The Players; it doesn't need to be anything else. \"I would say it's got more of an identity than the PGA Championship does at the minute. So, from an identity standpoint, The Players has got it nailed. ... I don't think it being classified a major or not a major makes it any more or any less [important]. I'm still very proud to have won that tournament twice, as I'm sure all the other champions are. It stands on its own without the label.\" McIlroy is a two-time winner at The Players, a five-time major champion, and as of last April, a career grand slam winner, so his perspective on the matter is valued.What McIlroy said about The Players having a stronger identity than the PGA Championship is from which much of the \"major\" debate stems. To that end, McIlroy suggested the PGA should flip back on the schedule, once again becoming the final major on the calendar.\"I think glory's last shot,\" said McIlroy when asked what identity the tournament should take. \"I think it needs to go back to August.\"The PGA Championship moved from August to May in 2019 with The Players moving from May to March. The PGA is often viewed as the fourth major, largely because it lacks the same unquestioned identity as the other three.\nThe Masters is staged at an iconic location each year at Augusta National Golf Club, kicking off the major season. The U.S. Open stakes its reputation on being golf's toughest test -- for better or worse -- and The Open is the oldest championship, one that shines a light on links golf. The PGA would push back on McIlroy's claim by stating its identity is being the \"strongest field in golf\" as it invites the top 100 players in the world without any amateurs competing. McIlroy believes it was better positioned as the last opportunity for players to capture a major championship each season. As for The Players, adding the \"major\" label could threaten what has made it such a beloved tournament. It stands out as the PGA Tour's flagship event, and it gets the early spotlight to itself in March. If it were to become a major, the Masters would likely insist The Players moves to May (PGA to August) to ensure the green jacket continues to be awarded first.\nThe Players nevertheless feels like a major, especially when it's at its best. It has a purse equivalent to one, too, without the added pressure. If it were to become a \"major,\" it would face similar challenges to the PGA, including the annual discourse about whether the event is worthy based on how exciting it plays.The truth is that The Players doesn't need the label to carry its own weight; in fact, not being attached to the majors works in its favor.\n            ",

In 31 starts and one relief appearance for Toronto, he pitched to a 3.96 ERA and a 4.01 FIP with 166 strikeouts in 170 ⅓ innings. For his career, Bassitt owns an ERA+ of 114 across parts of 11 big-league seasons. He's earned one All-Star selection and on three occasions finished in the top 10 in the Cy Young vote. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Bassitt as the No. 34 available free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"You won't find many pitchers like Bassitt, who chucks his primary pitch (a sinker) more than 40% of the time and yet still manages to throw seven other offerings at least three out of every 100 tosses. (Those other eight pitches include a cutter, curve, four-seamer, sweeper, splitter, slider, and changeup.) Most of Bassitt's matériel grade out as average, give or take, but he's found success by mixing, matching, and locating. His durability (he's started 30-plus times four years running) and kitchen-sink approach make him a useful pitcher to have on hand during the regular season. It is telling, though, that the Blue Jays left him out of their postseason rotation.\"In Baltimore, Bassitt will join a remade rotation that also includes Shane Baz, who was acquired in trade from the Rays. The Orioles are hoping to rebound from a disappointing 2025 campaign in which they lost 87 games and finished last in the AL East. Last season, Baltimore ranked 24th in MLB in rotation ERA and 25th in rotation FIP. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Just when you think the NWSL preseason is settling ahead of the new calendar year, the big moves keep coming. Kansas City Current have acquired midfielder Croix Bethune from Washington Spirit, sources tell CBS Sports. Washington Spirit are set to receive a record-matching fee for Bethune. The deal is finalized though not set to be announced until a later date.North Carolina Courage currently holds the record for intraleague funds ($1.25 million) after trading Jaedyn Shaw to Gotham FC last year. Bethune is coming off a successful two-year stint with the Washington Spirit, where she won the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year. In her first pro season, she tied Tobin Heath's decade-old single-season assist record in just 17 games thanks to a season-ending torn meniscus. She also won the league's inaugural NWSL Midfielder of the Year award. Her impressive rookie season earned her a place on the 2024 Olympic gold medal-winning U.S. women's national team, and she's recorded seven caps so far.Sources also confirmed that the player requested the trade, and her former club worked to complete the deal. Bethune received interest from other teams, though now she'll be joining the league's reigning NWSL Shield winners. \nShe often showcases her vision with short, elegant passes and is a certified playmaker. Her move to Kansas City is a welcome arrival following the departure of recent playmaker and goal scorer Bia Zaneratto. The Brazilian international left the club after her contract expired and returned to Palmeiras in free agency.Bethune's rise to prominence was anything but easy. The player has had to bounce back from a torn meniscus that cut her NWSL rookie season short. In college, the player tore her ACL twice, but was drafted into the NWSL after earning two-time first-team All-American and Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year honors with a career that saw her start at Southern California and finish at Georgia. She's shown she can bounce back and contribute and now joins Kansas City after her recent camps with the U.S. women's national team and a short preseason stint with the Spirit. \nWashington Spirit make it officialFollowing CBS Sports' reporting that Bethune's movement came by way of request, the Spirit announced Bethune's departure on Wednesday. Bethune's move to Kansas City yielded a club-record $100k in allocation funds and $900k in transfer threshold funds, the third-largest return in NWSL history. \"We are grateful to Croix for her contributions over the past two seasons. After conversations about her desire to explore development opportunities in a different environment, we were able to structure a deal that honored her request while securing significant value for our club, making it the third-highest intra-league transfer in NWSL history and a top ten mark globally,\" said club president of soccer operations Haley Carter. \"We evaluate every situation on its individual merits, and in this case, the alignment of player goals and organizational value made sense for all parties. That said, our focus is on the talented core we have returning. We're heading into 2026 healthy, deep, and ready to win.\"\nClaire Hutton moves on from Kansas City CurrentKansas City Current also traded midfielder Claire Hutton to Bay FC on Wednesday. The Midwest club received $1.1 million in intraleague transfer funds for the 2025 NWSL Best XI honoree, who is also a member of the USWNT. \"Claire is an important signing for us. She's a top-quality player who is tight on the ball, and she has the mobility and physical presence to break up play,\" said Bay FC head coach Emma Coates.\"Despite her age she brings experience and a strong mentality, and we believe she has the potential to become one of the best midfielders in the world. The most exciting part for us is her desire to keep getting better, and we're excited to support her through the next stages of her career and even more excited to see the impact she will have at Bay FC.\" \nThe 20-year-old Hutton was a 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year finalist and leaves Kansas City Current as a rising star in the NWSL and U.S. women's national team. Hutton signed her first professional contract in 2024 at 17 years old with Kansas City, the sixth player signed under the league's Under-18 Entry Mechanism, and she has since become a regular club starter with a bright future for her new club and her country.She has 13 appearances for the USWNT since her debut in 2025, and recently, head coach Emma Hayes discussed a leadership role with the midfielder, who is the youngest player to captain the national team in the Hayes era. When could they make official debuts?The Kansas City Current open up their season hosting the Utah Royals at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday, March 14, while Bay FC host expansion side Denver Summit the same day with kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Of the 34 starting quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl, Sam Darnold's story is one of the most unique. The No. 3 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold toiled on bad New York Jets teams before having a brief reprieve with the Carolina Panthers and then blossoming into a Pro Bowler with the Minnesota Vikings. After late-season struggles, the Vikings deemed Darnold expendable, though, which led to him signing a multi-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks, whose faith in Darnold was quickly rewarded with another Pro Bowl season that culminated in the franchise's second Super Bowl win. Seattle celebrated that victory on Wednesday, and Darnold was quick to show his appreciation for the team that brought him in as a free agent.\"I've talked a lot this last week about belief,\" Darnold told the crowd during Wednesday's victory parade. \"A lot of people didn't believe in me, but it didn't matter because the ones that are close believed in me, including you all. I appreciate you all so much. That short list also includes [team owner] Jody Allen, [general manager] John Schneider, [coach] Mike Macdonald. I appreciate the belief you all had in me for signing me this past year.\n\"And last but certainly not least, these players, man, for believing in me. I wouldn't be here without these guys.\"\nThroughout the season, Darnold received public support from his teammates that included some fiery comments in Week 11 from linebacker Ernest Jones IV. Jones went out of his way to praise Darnold when it was his time to address the crowd on Wednesday.\"Not only do we have the best defense in the world, we've got the best team in the world,\" he said. \"And quite frankly, if you've got anything to say about my quarterback, if you've got anything to say about my defense, if you've got anything to say about our o-line, if you've got anything to say about the city of Seattle, I've got two words for you: f--- you!\"\nWhile he played on a strong team with an elite defense, Darnold played a significant role in Seattle's success this season. He out-dueled league MVP Matthew Stafford during Seattle's come-from-behind win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 16 and did so again in the NFC title game. In the Super Bowl, Darnold more than held his own against a New England Patriots defense that was constantly jumping routes and blanketing his receivers. On the game's first drive, Darnold completed several tough passes that helped set up the first of Jason Myers' Super Bowl record five field goals. Darnold and Patriots counterpart Drake Maye had their struggles, but Darnold's play started to elevate as Kenneth Walker III piled up yards on the ground. With New England's defense focused on Walker, Darnold took advantage and helped the Seahawks put together six scoring drives. His 16-yard touchdown pass to AJ Barner that made it a 19-0 game early in the fourth quarter. \nAnd with a strong core intact, the Seahawks believe they can compete for years to come. \"We're not done,\" defensive end Leonard Williams said. \"We're coming back next year.\"\n            ",

The Washington County attorney's office said in a news release Wednesday that the charges stem from an alleged Feb. 23, 2025 incident in St. George, Utah.Washington County Attorney Jerry Jaeger said the investigation began after the alleged victim, a then-20-year-old woman, went to the hospital and reported that she was sexually assaulted by Kingston. \"Detectives with the St. George Police Department then gathered digital and forensic evidence. They also conducted interviews with the parties involved and other witnesses. The information was then turned over to the Washington County Attorney's Office for review,\" the Washington County attorney's office said in a news release.Kingston, 21, is currently being held in jail without bail and is scheduled to appear in Utah's 5th Judicial District Court on Friday.\n\"BYU became aware today of the arrest of Parker Kingston,\" BYU athletics said in a statement. \"The university takes any allegation very seriously, and will cooperate with law enforcement. Due to federal and university privacy laws and practices for students, the university will not be able to provide additional comment.\"Kingston finished the 2025 season as BYU's top pass catcher with 66 catches for 924 yards and five touchdowns. He announced Jan. 2 that he intended to return to BYU for his final college season. \nKingston's arrest comes less than a year after quarterback Jake Retzlaff was accused of sex assault in a civil lawsuit. The case was later dismissed, but Retzlaff left BYU because he was facing a seven-game suspension for violating the university's honor code. He later transferred to Tulane.\n            \n    ",

During Patullo's one season in that role, Philadelphia's offense was just 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing, 18th in rushing, and 24th in third down efficiency.A year earlier, with current New Orleans Saints coach Kellen Moore serving as offensive coordinator, Philadelphia's offense ranked seventh in the league in scoring, 29th in passing, second in rushing 10th in third down efficiency and 13th in red zone efficiency. In the playoffs, the Eagles averaged over 36 points per game that included 55 points in the NFC title game and 40 points in their Super Bowl win over the Kansas City Chiefs. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL franchise tag primer: What we're hearing on top candidates and early tag decisions\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite the offense's struggles and intense fan backlash, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni kept Patullo in place as the primary play-caller throughout the season. Sirianni ultimately made the decision to change course following Philadelphia's 23-19 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC wild card round. Patullo was Philadelphia's passing game coordinator and associate head coach before being elevated to offensive coordinator. He also had coaching stints with the Chiefs, Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Titans, New York Jets, and Indianapolis Colts, where he worked with Sirianni. \nAfter Patullo's demotion, the Eagles hired former Packers quarterbacks coach Sean Mannion to run the offense amid a slew of changes to Sirianni's coaching staff. Notably, longtime offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland also left the staff after 13 seasons. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline has passed. The rosters, more or less, are set (we'll see what happens in the buyout market). The All-Star break is nearing, and after that we'll be into the stretch run of the regular season. These playoff races are tight beyond the top spot of each conference. So how do we see it shaking out? Factoring in remaining schedules, roster upgrades, recent play, tanking incentives, tiebreakers and everything else pertinent to positioning, let's take a shot at predicting the final standings in each conference with almost exactly two months to go. West playoff teams1. Oklahoma City Thunder2. San Antonio Spurs3. Denver Nuggets4. Minnesota Timberwolves5. Houston Rockets6. Los Angeles LakersOKC has a 3 ½-game lead over San Antonio. The Spurs in turn has a 3 ½-game lead over Houston. Those two seeds should hold. From No. 3 down it's a free-for-all. Nothing about the Nuggets' case on paper says they should end up at No. 3. Aaron Gordon is out perhaps until mid-March and they've been a break-even team without him. They have the hardest remaining schedule. They've lost four of six since Nikola Jokić's return. This last factor only tells me they're about to go on a run. That's how much I, and you, should, believe in the world's best player. Houston is the team that has the easiest remaining schedule on paper, but the Rockets are also the only team among the West's current top 11 teams that has double-digit losses against sub-.500 teams. They just haven't been consistent enough for me to trust them in games they should win, and I'm especially concerned now with the Steven Adams offensive rebounding advantage removed. \nMinnesota hasn't been great against plus-.500 teams so far and has the league's fourth-toughest remaining schedule, but I love the Ayo Dosunmu addition and I think Anthony Edwards, who has been awesome in the clutch this season, wins them enough tight games down the stretch to land a top-four seed. West play-in teams7. Phoenix Suns8. Golden State Warriors9. Portland Trail Blazers10. Los Angeles ClippersPhoenix is tied in the loss column with No. 6 Minnesota entering play on Wednesday and is just two games back of a top-four seed. The Suns have the league's fifth-toughest remaining schedule, which includes two more dates vs. OKC, San Antonio and Boston, and one more each against Denver and Houston. At the moment the Suns have a 2-1 advantage over the Lakers in head-to-head with one matchup remaining. If the Suns, who are currently just one game back of the Lakers, win that game on Feb. 26 and secure the tiebreaker, I will give Phoenix the edge for the No. 6 seed. But until then, the Lakers have a big chance to increase their lead to two over Phoenix and catch them in division wins (the next tiebreaker) with games against Sacramento and two more against Golden State remaining, and they have the same number of remaining games vs. tanking teams (11) as Phoenix. \nEven after the Harden and Ivica Zubac trades, I'll say the Clippers hold onto a play-in spot because they have every incentive to do so. They don't own their 2026 first-round pick. Darius Garland will likely come back. This remains a talented team.  West lottery teams11. Memphis Grizzlies12. Dallas Mavericks13. New Orleans Pelicans14. Utah Jazz15. Sacramento KingsThe Kings have a three-loss \"lead\" on the league's worst record. The Jazz are seasoned tankers and already putting on a fourth-quarter-concession clinic. New Orleans is the only team here with no reason to tank; the Pelicans don't own their 2026 pick. For that reason I think the Jazz do what it takes to fall below the Pelicans, but the Mavericks and Grizzlies have too much distance to cover with six- and eight-game advantages, respectively. \n        \n            \n                NBA Tank Watch: Ranking nine teams gunning for No. 1 pick after trade deadline\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEast playoff teams1. Detroit Pistons2. Cleveland Cavaliers3. New York Knicks4. Boston Celtics5. Philadelphia 76ers6. Orlando MagicNo team has more remaining games against tanking teams than the Cavs, who have added James Harden as a short-term upgrade over the injured Darius Garland and were finding their stride even before the trade. They are too far back to catch Detroit, but I like them jumping New York and Boston for the No. 2 seed and then we will see if Harden can shake his shaky playoff reputation. \nIn reality, 2-7 is a crapshoot in the East. Boston has been the most consistent team outside of Detroit, but I like the way the Knicks are playing of late (as long as Jose Alvarado can reasonably cover for the troubling loss of Deuce McBride for at least the remainder of the regular season) and Karl-Anthony Towns has to start making 3s at some point.Philly and Toronto are tied 2-2 in head-to-head, but right now Philadelphia has a four-game edge in Atlantic Division record, which would be the next tiebreaker. In a race this close, the tiebreaker matters. Paul George being out for 19 more games is a problem, but the Sixers have fared well enough without post-suspension.I really believe in Tyrese Maxey, and with the Raptors having the sixth-toughest remaining schedule and the Magic having 13 remaining games against taking teams, I'll say Orlando jumps Toronto for the No. 6 seed. East play-in teams7. Toronto Raptors8. Charlotte Hornets9. Miami Heat10. Atlanta HawksThe Hornets the best story in the NBA right now. They've won nine of their last 10 and took Detroit to the wire on Monday. The starting lineup rules. They're too far back of Orlando (five games in the loss column) to realistically catch the Magic or the Raptors, but they're only two back of No. 8 Miami. Plenty of time to catch the Heat and give themselves two play-in games to win one and secure a playoff spot. \nEast lottery teams11. Chicago Bulls12. Milwaukee Bucks13. Brooklyn Nets14. Washington Wizards15. Indiana PacersThe Bulls are one back of Charlotte and Atlanta so a play-in spot is right there. Losing Nikola Vučević hurts and all their point guards are an experiment for the future more than a win-now blueprint. Milwaukee is tied with Chicago in the loss column but is highly motivated to secure as a high a lottery pick as possible to try, however foolish it would probably be, to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo by dangling that pick in a trade. The Wizards traded for Anthony Davis and Trae Young, but do not expect to be seeing much of them as Washington has a top-eight protected pick it owes to the Knicks. Any team with a protected pick is going throttle down to make sure they keep it in a draft class like this one, but I'll still give the edge to Indiana to secure the East's worst record with a two-loss head start as of the writing. \n            ",

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 season is far from over but it's already time inspect the report card of the most expensive 2025 summer transfer window moves. Players like Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko kept us busy last summer with their moves, but their start of the season with their new clubs haven't gone as expected, while others have performed up to expectations and beyond. With the 2026 winter transfer window about to start, let's go back and grade the most expensive 2025 summer transfers: 10. Matheus CunhaFrom Wolverhampton to Manchester United for $84.5 million (add-ons included)Three goals scored so far in 16 games played between Premier League and EFL Cup with Manchester United, under Ruben Amorim, the former Wolverhampton striker has played regularly and he's having an impact, starting the last nine Premier League fixtures, scoring also two goals in the last three. He's improving, and the feeling is that things can get even better in the near future. Good start. Grade: B9. Victor Osimhen From Napoli to Galatasaray for $87.5 million (add-ons included)Even if this signing wasn't as exciting as the others on this list, the former Napoli striker performed wonderfully in the team he moved to in the summer of 2024 on loan. Galatasaray decided to invest big on him last summer, and they were wise in doing so -- 12 goals scored in 16 games so far, including six scored in the four games played in the Champions League league phase. It looks like he's fitting well in this team and he can achieve big things at Galatasaray this season. Grade: A8. Luis Diaz From Liverpool to Bayern Munich for $88.5 million (add-ons included)By far the best signing in the top 10. Luis Diaz is doing great things in Germany at Bayern Munich where he has already scored 13 goals in the 22 matches he played so far in all competitions, and also seven assists provided to his teammates. One goal every 137 minutes and an incredible impact in the team coached by Vincent Kompany, he is quickly becoming one of the big stars of the German giants. Grade: A+\n7. Eberechi EzeFrom Crystal Palace to Arsenal for $91 million (add-ons included)There were high expectations and ambitions after his late move to Arsenal after he almost agreed terms to join Tottenham. It was one of the biggest stories and surprises of the summer transfer window, and to be honest, we could expect a bit more from his performances. But he has done well in some exciting matches, particularly when he scored the hat trick, ironically against Tottenham in the North London derby won 4-1 by the Gunners. Grade: B6. Nick WoltemadeFrom Stuttgart to Newcastle for $93 million (add-ons included)The German striker suffered a bit from the poor performances and results of Newcastle in the opening part of the season, as the Magpies are currently sitting 14th in the Premier League standings with 23 points after 18 games. On the other hand, Woltemade already scored nine goals with his new team and showed to be at the level of the Premier League and his rivals. If his team also improve, we can expect a lot more goals from him. Grade: B-5. Bryan Mbuemo From Brentford to Manchester United for $95 million (add-ons included)Let's be honest -- when Manchester United signed him this summer, we all thought this was going to be another disappointment. Welp. Seven goals scored so far in the 17 matches he played, he immediately became one of the key players of the team coached by Amorim. He's now in Morocco where he's playing the AFCON with Cameroon, and Manchester United hope to see him back in the team as soon as possible. They need him. Grade: B+\n4. Benjamin Sesko From RB Leipzig to Manchester United for $99 million (add-ons included)The exact opposite of Mbuemo. Back in the summer, I thought he was going to shine and become an important player of Manchester United but so far he has only scored two goals in the 17 matches he has played with the Red Devils. I was expecting a bigger impact and stronger numbers from a player who has consistently impressed me in recent years, but he still has time. At just 22, there is a lot of potential waiting to be realized. Grade: C-3. Hugo Ekitike From Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool for $106 million (add-ons included)The French international immediately proved to be a crucial player in the team coached by Arne Slot. Ekitike has already scored 11 goals in the 24 matches he played and was definitely the best signing made by Liverpool this season, also because the other ones were really disappointing, at least up to now. Grade: B+2. Florian WirtzFrom Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool for $157 million (add-ons included). If the Ekitike signing was one of the best ones, we can't say the same about the Florian Wirtz move to Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen, especially considering the money the English team spent for the German striker. Wirtz scored his first goal for his new club over the weekend against Wolverhampton, but expectations were higher. There is still time for him to improve and adapting to the Premier League is never easy in the short term. He will need to show more in the second half of the season. Grade: C-\n1. Alexander Isak From Newcastle to Liverpool for $168 million (add-ons included). The Swedish striker was really disappointing so far, especially considering the money spent and the expectations after the saga of his transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool. He has scored only three goals in the first part of the season and is now sidelined with a leg injury that could keep him out for potentially months. They hoped something different in Liverpool. Grade: D\n            ",

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said following Pittsburgh's 13-6 loss that Washington has broken his arm. Washington was seen after the game wearing a cast and sling over his injured arm. His availability moving forward is not currently known. The Steelers host the Baltimore Ravens next week in a game that will determine which team will win the AFC North and the playoff spot that comes with it. Washington caught both of his targets for 15 yards prior to exiting Sunday's game. A former third-round pick, the 6-foot-7 Washington was in the midst of his most productive season to date with a career-high 31 catches through 16 games. \"Yeah, Darnell is a big part of what we do,\" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said when asked about how Washington's absence impacted the offense. If Washington is out for a significant portion of time, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth would likely have a bigger role in the offense. Neither player, however, is as good as a blocker as Jones, who is often used in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's offense as a pseudo tackle. \nAlong with Washington, the Steelers played the entire game without DK Metcalf, who also won't face the Ravens next week as part of his two-game suspension stemming from last week's altercation with a Lions fan. The absences of both players clearly had a negative impact on Rodgers, who threw for just 168 yards on 21 of 39 passing. \"We didn't execute very well on third downs,\" Rodgers said. \"I didn't have a very good game. Didn't run the ball early like we wanted to. Pretty bad on third down.\" One Steelers offensive player who did have a good game Sunday was Jaylen Warren, who rushed for a game-high 64 yards on 12 carries. Warren is among Pittsburgh's skill players who will have to pick up the slack even more next week with Metcalf out and Washington's status in question. \n\"Nobody's panicking,\" Warren said after Sunday's game when asked about Pittsburgh's current predicament. \"I'm not worried. We'll be good.\" \n            \n    ",

The two-time MVP poured in 29 points, which he capped off with a fastbreak windmill dunk in the final two seconds after the game was already well decided.After the final buzzer sounded, Bulls forward Nikola VucevicVučević and guard Coby White approached Antetokounmpo to share their irritation with his unnecessary dunk which led to both benches emptying to defuse the situation.\n\"We're 11th in the East,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Got to keep finding an identity. And if that's to get a little bit of scrappy at the end, so be it. We're not champs. Why should we play the clock out and have respect and fair play? We're fighting for our lives right now.\"The Bucks went 2-6 in Antetokounmpo's absence, and are just 13-19 on the season. While it's a night-and-day difference when Giannis is on the floor, the Bucks struggled to consistently string together wins, even in a weak Eastern Conference.\"This is real tough,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I've been 13 years in the league. If we keep on losing, probably half of the team not going to be here. We're not going to make the playoffs. I really don't care. At the end of the day, I just want to be available, be healthy and help my team win. And if [a windmill dunk] is what has to happen for everybody to wake up and understand, we're fighting for our lives and we got to get our hands dirty, so be it.\"\nBulls players took exception with Antetokounmpo's actions.\"He shouldn't have dunked the ball,\" White said after the game. \"It's disrespectful to the game. I said, 'Bro, you're better than that.' The game is over with. Why you got to do that? It's a respect thing.\"Vučević tried to rationalize Antetokounmpo's actions, saying, \"I'm assuming Giannis was mad about that report that came out the Bulls didn't want to trade for him.\"\nTrade hype hovered over the Bucks for most of the season after a report surfaced that Antetokounmpo may request one by midseason. There are conflicting reports about his actual willingness to request a trade, but comments last night suggest he is not happy with the state of things in Milwaukee.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Assists were the theme of Week 17 in the NFL. Various outcomes throughout the slate had ramifications that stretched beyond the two teams going toe to toe and have begun reshaping the playoff picture in both conferences.On Christmas Day, the Vikings punched the Packers' ticket to the playoffs after defeating the Lions. On Saturday, the Texans not only clinched a playoff berth, but handed the AFC West title to the Broncos after defeating the Chargers. As we continued through Sunday's action, even more assists were dished out, most notably with the Seahawks and Browns pulling off wins against the Panthers and Steelers, respectively.Because of those outcomes (along with Miami defeating Tampa Bay), we could have two win-or-go-home division title matchups in Week 18: Ravens at Steelers for the AFC North and Panthers at Buccaneers for the NFC South. However, this NFC South matchup could have a wrench thrown into it depending on how the Falcons end their season. While out of the playoff race, if Atlanta wins out (vs. the Rams on Monday night and Saints), Carolina will win the division, regardless of the outcome of that matchup with the Bucs. That's due to the Panthers winning a tiebreaker because of a better head-to-head record among the three teams. In the late window on Sunday, the Eagles lent a helping hand to the Patriots, securing the AFC East crown for New England after Philly took down the Bills in Buffalo. \nOn top of those matchups, the No. 1 seeds in both conferences are still up for grabs, so we're in for quite the finish. As we wrap up the bulk of Sunday's action leading into \"Sunday Night Football,\" here's a look at the current playoff picture. AFC standingsz-Denver Broncos (13-3)z-New England Patriots (13-3)x-Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)x-Houston Texans (11-5)x-Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)x-Buffalo Bills (11-5)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. ChargersDenver got back to its winning ways with a key victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. With the win, the Broncos remain the No. 1 seed in the conference and are now the AFC West division winners after the Texans beat the Chargers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had already clinched a playoff berth in Week 16, and are now AFC East champions thanks to the events of Week 17. They did their part earlier on Sunday by blowing out the Jets, and then the Eagles fended off the Bills to lock up the division. New England is also still alive for the No. 1 seed. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Remaining schedule: vs. TitansThe Jaguars fended off the Colts in Week 17 and can clinch the AFC South next week with a win over the Titans.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)Remaining schedule: vs. RavensAfter falling to the Browns in Week 17, the Steelers face a do-or-die matchup with the Ravens in Week 18. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Houston Texans (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have won eight straight games to punch their ticket to the playoffs. Houston extended that winning streak with a victory over the Chargers on the road and remains alive in the AFC South race. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)Remaining schedule: at BroncosThe Chargers had their four-game winning streak snapped with a Saturday afternoon loss against the Texans. They are likely to rest players in Week 18 and prepare for a road opener. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. JetsThe Bills' defeat at the hands of the Eagles in Week 17 officially eliminated them from winning the AFC East and has dropped them to the No. 7 seed. The Bills have already clinched a playoff berth, so it'll be interesting to see if they opt for rest over seed positioning in Week 18. In the huntThe Ravens (8-8), with Lamar Jackson sidelined, kept their playoff hopes alive with an impressive road win against the Packers in Green Bay. Then, on Sunday, they had their prayers answered with the Browns upsetting Pittsburgh. That sets up a winner-take-all matchup in the AFC North against the Steelers in Week 18. The loser will be eliminated from playoff contention. \nNFC standingsx-Seattle Seahawks (13-3)z-Chicago Bears (11-4)z-Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Carolina Panthers (8-8)x-San Francisco 49ers (11-4)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-4)x-Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (13-3)Remaining schedule: at 49ersSeattle pulled off an incredible, come-from-behind win over the Rams on \"Thursday Night Football,\" elevating itself to the No. 1 seed in the conference in the process. They continued to hold that top spot in the conference after taking down the Panthers in Week 17. So long as they take down the 49ers in Week 18, they'll win the NFC West and be the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-4)Remaining schedule: at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears are coming off a stunning comeback win over the Packers in Week 16, and they remain in the hunt for the NFC's No. 1 seed. Thanks to the Packers' loss to the Ravens, Chicago has officially clinched the NFC North title.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. CommandersPhiladelphia punched its playoff ticket in Week 16 with a commanding victory over the Commanders. The defending Super Bowl champions became the first team to win back-to-back NFC East crowns since 2004. After outlasting the Bills in Week 17, the Eagles are merely fighting for seeding in the regular-season finale\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Carolina Panthers (8-8)Remaining schedule: at BuccaneersAfter losing to the Seahawks, Carolina is potentially faced with a winner-take-all matchup in Tampa in Week 18 against the Buccaneers. However, if the Falcons (who play the Rams on Monday night) win their final two games, that would trigger a tiebreaking scenario that falls in favor of the Panthers, who'd have the better head-to-head record in this three-way tie. That situation would render the results of Carolina's Week 18 matchup moot. If Atlanta falls to L.A. on Monday night, however, then the contest would be for the division crown. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. San Francisco 49ers (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe 49ers are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race and clinched a postseason berth after the Lions fell to the Steelers. San Francisco jumped the Rams into the No. 5 spot after walloping the Colts on \"Monday Night Football,\" and it's positioned to climb even higher over the final two weeks.If the 49ers beat the Bears and Seahawks to close out the season, they'll secure the No. 1 seed and the conference's lone first-round bye.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are still a playoff lock thanks to their win in Week 15, but their chances of winning the NFC West and claiming the No. 1 seed in the conference were dramatically reduced by their loss to the Seahawks in Week 16. They need Seattle to lose to the 49ers in Week 18, but also need the 49ers to lose to the Bears. Otherwise, San Francisco would be the top seed in the conference by virtue of having the best division record among the three teams. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)Remaining schedule: at VikingsGreen Bay, minus Jordan Love, fell to Derrick Henry and the Ravens on Saturday night. The loss ended any hopes of winning the NFC North title and locked Green Bay into the NFC's No. 7 seed.In the huntThe Buccaneers (7-9) have experienced a dramatic fall from grace in this second half of the season. Even after losing to the Dolphins in Week 17, however, they still have an opportunity to jump up to the No. 4 seed as the NFC South champion. To do that, the Bucs need to win their Week 18 contest against the Panthers and have the Falcons lose one of their final two games. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        New Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham has dozens on 1-on-1 meetings with players to finish up over the next few days before tackling talent acquisition in the transfer portal, but first, roster retention is of utmost importance.Whittingham said Sunday during his introductory press conference that the first player he sat down with was freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood, the top-rated player in the 2025 recruiting cycle who has eclipsed 2,500 yards of total offense this season ahead of Wednesday's battle against Texas in the Citrus Bowl.\"I did a lot of listening,\" Whittingham said of his 45-minute conversation with Underwood. \"I wanted feedback from him, I wanted to get to know him. Everything from growing up, family, what's important to him -- it was a great conversation. He's a special young man. Carries himself the right way, you got to have a quarterback that has that 'it' factor and Bryce definitely has that 'it' factor.\"Along with a ton of talent. Big, strong kid. 6-foot-4, 225-plus pounds. His ceiling is very high, and the offense that we are going to bring in here I think will suit him to a T. I think he's going to really, really excel and have a great experience here.\"\nAhead of Whittingham's meeting with Michigan's starting quarterback in Orlando, Underwood said he was \"excited\" to chat with the former Utah coach given his expansive resume of success.\"Very excited to figure out what kind of guy he is. I don't really know too much about him. I'm just excited to figure out what kind of guy he is,\" Underwood said. Underwood said he's made no plans for beyond the bowl game for 2026 and will \"figure it out\" with his family.\nCBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported this weekend that Whittingham is targeting Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck as his play-caller in Ann Arbor, a necessary potential acquisition given his impact on the Utes' offense this season.Utah ranked second nationally in rushing this season at 269.7 yards per game on the ground and fifth nationally in scoring at 41.1 points per game. Whittingham acknowledged Sunday that Michigan's offense will bring a \"physicality-first\" mindset and everything starts for the Wolverines at the line of scrimmage.If Underwood returns, he'll be the headliner for a Michigan offense expected to bring back ballcarrier Jordan Marshall, several players up front and wideout Andrew Marsh, among others. Asked what kind of offense Michigan will have in 2026, Whittingham went into detail on his plan.\n\"Spread. We're going to base it out of the spread,\" Whittingham said. \"Eleven personnel will be our base personnel group. We're going to run the football efficiently. The only people that were in the same category as us [at Utah] were the service academies -- Air Force, Navy. Otherwise, I believe that if you can run the football effectively, everything happens off of that.\" Raw as a passer during his first season in the Big Ten, Underwood completed 61.1% of his passes for 2,229 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions. He's comfortable and capable as a runner, an area that could be further developed under Whittingham's preferred scheme.Utah quarterback Devon Dampier rushed for 687 yards and seven touchdowns this season while backup Byrd Ficklin, a freshman, managed 503 yards and 10 scores on just 56 attempts.\nWhittingham, who went 177-88 with the Utes, was hired to stabilize a program in disarray following the firing of Sherrone Moore, a bitter ending to a scandal-ridden era that overlaps Michigan's unbeaten, national title campaign in 2023.Whittingham said Michigan was one of a handful of jobs across the country that he would say \"yes\" to when the search landed on him.\"What you can expect? Physicality will be our calling card,\" Whittingham said. \"We were the most physical team in whatever league we played in. I believe in running the football and defending the run. If you can win the line of scrimmage, be physical up front.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With Jordan Love out of the game on Saturday, Malik Willis took over at quarterback for the Green Bay Packers and he played a nearly perfect game. Although the Packers got blown out, 41-24, by the Ravens, you can't blame the loss on Willis, who totaled 348 yards and three touchdowns. Willis was so good against the Ravens that the Packers didn't punt a single time in the game. Yup, that's right: The Packers didn't punt a single time and they still lost. And now, we get to the ugly part: The loss by Green Bay marks the third time this season that the Packers have lost a game where they didn't punt, which is the most by any team in the Super Bowl era. There have been 60 seasons played since the inception of the Super Bowl, and in that span, there had only been two teams that had even lost TWO games in a single season without punting the ball: The 2021 Chargers and 2024 Bengals. Both of those teams finished with a 9-8 record, which is almost fitting, because the Packers will also finish the season with nine wins if they lose to the Bears in Week 18. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSince you might be wondering how a team could possibly lose three games where they didn't punt the ball a single time, let's break down how it happened. The Packers had their first no-punt loss back in Week 9 when Carolina beat them 16-13. The Packers had seven possessions in that game and here's how they played out: FumbleField goalField goalMissed field goalInterceptionFailed fourth downTouchdownThe Packer piled up 369 yards, but they only scored 13 points due to their costly miscues. The failed fourth down came from Carolina's 13-yard line in the fourth quarter, so that wasn't a situation where the Packers would have punted even if it had come at an earlier point in the game. \nThe Packers second loss with no punts came in Week 16 when they blew a 10-point lead against the Bears in the fourth quarter of a game they eventually lost in overtime. Here's how their possessions went in that 22-16 loss: Failed fourth down (Fourth-and-1 from Chicago 7-yard line)Field goalField goalKneel down to end halfFumble TouchdownField goalKneel down to end regulationFailed fourth down in overtime (Fourth-and-1 from Chicago 36-yard line)Once again, the Packers offense moved the ball up and down the field, but they had trouble finishing their drives. The failed fourth down in overtime ended up costing the Packers big because four plays after the fourth down failure, Caleb Williams hit D.J. Moore with a 46-yard game-winning touchdown pass. The Packers' third loss with no punts came against the Ravens. Once again, let's check out how their possessions went: \nTouchdownFailed fourth down (Fourth-and-1 at Green Bay 34-yard line)FumbleTouchdownKneel down to end halfField goalTouchdown InterceptionFailed fourth down (Fourth-and-8 at 50-yard line)The Packers went 0-for-2 on fourth down against the Ravens and that ended up being a huge factor in the game. They also went 1-for-3 on fourth down against the Bears, which means they've gone 1-for-5 over the past two weeks. When you're not punting, that usually means that your offense is playing well, and for that most part, that's been the case for the Packers, but they've also made several costly mistakes in their no-punt games, which is why they're now on the wrong side of NFL history. Thanks to these three no-punt games, Green Bay's Daniel Whelan has only had 41 punts this year, which is tied for the fourth-lowest number in the league for any punter that's played at least 15 games. Although Whelen hasn't punted much, he's actually been pretty solid this year: He's tied for the NFL-lead with a punting average of 51.3 yards and he ranks 11th overall in net punting average at 42.6. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan introduced Kyle Whittingham as its new coach Sunday in Orlando, a few days ahead of the Dec. 31 Citrus Bowl showdown against Texas. Capping a season that is anything but ordinary at Michigan, it seemed oddly fitting Whittingham's poignant promise for change was delivered nearly 1,200 miles from Ann Arbor.\"I could count on one hand the number of jobs I would have said 'yes' to and Michigan was one of them,\" Whittingham said. \"I believe in family. We've got an adage as coaches 'we love the players and players love each other' … if you can get that done, you're halfway home.\"There is nobody above the team, and you got to have everybody buy in, and everybody, including myself, lead this team. When this team is that we got everyone on that page and understanding that concept, and that's going to be very positive.\"Talent retention and assessing needs are vital.\"College football is all about the players. If you've got good players, you've got a chance,\" Whittingham said.\nWhittingham revealed that he met with quarterback Bryce Underwood for nearly an hour Sunday morning. Underwood said after Citrus Bowl practice Saturday that he was \"excited\" to chat with Whittingham, but is undecided on his next move.\"A quarterback's got to have an 'it' factor, and he's got it,\" Whittingham said, who \"did a lot of listening\" and called Underwood \"a special young man\" on the Michigan roster.\"The offense we're bringing here, I think, is going to suit him to a tee,\" Whittingham said. \"And I think he's going to really, really excel and have a great experience here.\"\nMichigan came to terms with Whittingham Dec. 26, agreeing to a five-year deal through the 2030 season. The 66-year-old coach stepped down at Utah after 21 seasons leading the Utes, bringing the program to unprecedented highs under his watch.Whittingham, who went 177-88 with the Utes, must stabilize a program in disarray following the firing of Sherrone Moore, a bitter ending to a scandal-ridden era that overlaps Michigan's unbeaten, national title campaign in 2023.\"What you can expect? Physicality will be our calling card,\" Whittingham said. \"We were the most physical team in whatever league we played in. I believe in running the football and defending the run. If you can win the line of scrimmage, be physical up front.\"\nWhittingham avoided NCAA sanctions at Utah and was never investigated for abnormalities over two decades of leadership. With eight 10-win seasons since 2008, three conference titles and a national coach of the year honor to his credit, Whittingham expects to win big at his next coaching stop, saying Michigan's \"winning tradition\" is what attracted him most to the Big Ten vacancy.\n            ",

Kiffin appeared as a guest in the broadcast booth during LSU's 38-35 loss to Houston in the Texas Bowl with new commentary on his departure from Oxford to Baton Rouge.Several of the offensive assistants following Kiffin to LSU reprised their roles as Ole Miss assistants during the postseason, which helped the Rebels run away from Tulane in the opening round, 41-10.\"They're doing a great job,\" Kiffin said. \"We saw the performance in the last game. They came back down here after that game, came down here for a couple of days and now they're back there. I was just on the phone with (offensive coordinator) Charlie Weis. We were talking about quarterback rankings, just we were going over them tonight. So, sometimes we have our staff meetings, even though they're back there, when Pete (Golding) is done with his. Then, we get on and have our own. \"We're just trying to make it work for both sides so Ole Miss can have the best chance of winning a national championship and we can also be building what we are here.\"\nKiffin later addressed his emotions during the Ole Miss victory in the first round.\"It was awesome,\" Kiffin said. \"It was a great day. It really was. I'm not just saying that. To watch those guys and how much they were smiling having that success. It was the biggest game in the history of the state of Mississippi. To blow out Tulane like that, it was awesome watching them. I was really excited for them.\"\nOle Miss athletic director Keith Carter elected not to allow Kiffin to coach through the postseason. Kiffin went 55-19 over six seasons with the Rebels. He received a $250,000 bonus from LSU following the Ole Miss playoff win, which was part of Kiffin's contractual agreement. Any advancements in the bracket from the Rebels come in the form of playoff bonuses to Kiffin from LSU. That number increases if Ole Miss knocks out SEC champion Georgia in the upcoming Sugar Bowl quarterfinal.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nA pair of division titles - the final two postseason berths - could be secured in Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season. The Pittsburgh Steelers can capture their first AFC North crown since 2020 with a road victory against the Cleveland Browns, and the Carolina Panthers can end Tampa Bay's four-year reign in the NFC South with a home win against the Seattle Seahawks and a Buccaneers loss to the Dolphins in Miami.Pittsburgh (9-6), which defeated Cleveland 23-9 at home in Week 6, will make its fifth trip to the playoffs in six seasons and render its Week 18 showdown with the Baltimore Ravens meaningless by posting its fourth consecutive victory. The Browns are looking to snap their four-game losing streak.Carolina (8-7), which hasn't won the division since 2015, gained the upper hand in the NFC South by edging Tampa Bay 23-20 at home last week. It was the third straight setback and sixth in seven games for the Buccaneers (7-8), who must end their slide keep alive their postseason hopes as they host the Panthers in a potential clash for the division title in Week 18.For Sunday's matchups, top sportsbooks have set the passing yards prop for Pittsburgh's Aaron Rodgers at 183.5 yards, Jaxon Smith-Njigba of Seattle's receiving yards prop at 90.5 and the rushing yards prop for Tampa Bay's Bucky Irving at 62.5.Before you play a side on Rodgers, Smith-Njigba, Irving or any player prop for Week 17 of the NFL season, you need to see what SportsLine player prop expert PropBetGuy has to say. The expert is +1267 on his last 73 NFL player prop picks. Here are his picks and analysis.Darnell Washington Over 26.5 receiving yards\nAnother week, another Washington Over.Washington has cleared this receiving yards line in four of his last seven games when fully healthy, coinciding with a bump in his snap and route share. The Steelers will be without receivers DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin on Sunday, which should create even more opportunities for the massive tight end.The Browns employ man coverage at the league's highest rate, and Washington now owns the highest target rate of the Steelers' pass catchers against man (23.5%, per PFF), sans Metcalf.The weather will be rough but Washington's low average depth of target and yards-after-catch ability should keep him plenty involved. I'd bet this up to Over 27.5 yards.Colston Loveland Over 3.5 receptions\nLoveland has cleared this line in six of his last eight games, despite a string of brutal matchups and weather. He'll have neither of those on Sunday Night Football in San Francisco.The 49ers really have struggled to defend tight ends since losing star linebacker Fred Warner for the season. Higher volume pass-catching tight ends have thrashed this defense – Trey McBride had 10 receptions while Kyle Pitts hauled in seven passes.Overall, the 49ers allow the most catches per game out of the slot (7.8, per Fantasy Points), and the seventh-most to in-line tight ends (3.4). Loveland should thrive in a better passing environment than what he's experienced over the last few weeks. I'd bet this up to -145.\n            ",

The Niners have catapulted themselves into the thick of the race for the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and they have two massive games remaining on the schedule with this one against the Bears followed by next week's showdown with the division rival Seattle Seahawks, which could be for all the marbles.Chicago has won two in a row after having its five-game winning streak snapped by the Packers, and is looking to go from worst to first in the NFC North. The Bears have now won seven of eight, with five of those wins coming by just one score. They're the league's premier comeback artists these days, and capturing a win here would further cement their comeback to relevance.Which of these two teams will thrust itself into position to compete for the conference's top spot? We'll find out soon enough. But before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch 49ers vs. BearsDate: Sunday, Dec. 28 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -3, O/U 52.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesPlayoff picture. Chicago and San Francisco have already each clinched playoff spots. But there is still plenty to play for. Chicago can clinch the NFC North win a win, but also may have already clinched by game time if the Packers lose to the Ravens on Saturday. Both of these teams can also still get the No. 1 seed in the conference. The path is clearer for the 49ers, but it exists for the Bears as well. If San Francisco beats both Chicago and Seattle, the Niners capture the top spot on the conference. The Bears, meanwhile, need to win both of their games and have the Seahawks lose at least one of their next two games.Coach of the Year. New England Patriots coach Mike Vrabel is the favorite for Coach of the Year at the moment, with -110 odds at DraftKings. But Niners coach Kyle Shanahan is tied for the second-best odds with Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald at +330, and Bears coach Ben Johnson is next at +650 odds. Whoever's team wins this game could have the inside track on being the top competition for Vrabel. Especially if the Niners win here, Shanahan has a path to overtaking Vrabel, because of the aforementioned No. 1 seed scenario. The Bears could still get the No. 1 seed, too, and if Johnson takes Chicago from worst in the division to first in the conference, he could easily capture the award as well.CMC's 1000-1000 quest. Christian McCaffrey has already reached 1,000 rushing yards on the season, topping the mark with a big game last week. But he's also 151 yards away from getting there as a receiver as well. He's already topped the 1000-1000 mark once in his career, way back in 2019. If he does it again, he'll be the first player in history to do it twice. With George Kittle possibly out for this game, McCaffrey could be even more involved as a receiver than usual.Injury issues. Both of these teams are depleted by injuries, which could make this game a battle of attrition. The Niners are practically a M.A.S.H. unit on the defensive side of the ball, and they could be without George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall or both on offense. The Bears have had Rome Odunze and T.J. Edwards, among others, each out of practice on Wednesday on Thursday, while Kyler Gordon, Dayo Odeyingo and Braxton Jones all remain on injured reserve.PredictionThe Bears have been pulling rabbits out of their collective hats all year, so going against them here feels at least somewhat risky. That's especially the case because their defense remains one of the most injury-ravaged units in the league. They're better against the run than they are against the pass, though, which helps in a game against the Bears, who lean on the run. San Francisco's offense, meanwhile, looks explosive after the bye. If Brock Purdy continues rolling, I like the Niners here.\nPrediction: 49ers 24, Bears 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Maxx Crosby is evaluating his future with the Las Vegas Raiders -- the only NFL team he has ever played for -- after his 2025 season came to an unhappy end, according to NFL Media. The Raiders shut down Crosby for the season ahead of a Week 17 game against the New York Giants due to a knee injury.It was a decision Crosby vehemently opposed. Pete Carroll said he excused Crosby from the facility. The Raiders and the Giants are both 2-13, and the loser of the Week 17 contest will take over the top spot in the NFL Draft order.\"I don't give a shit about the pick to be honest,\" Crosby told reporters Tuesday. \"I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world and that's what I'm focused on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence -- being that guy on a consistent basis for my team. That's [the NFL Draft] their job, the front office, the coaches, they do that. But that's got nothing to do with me.\"The team also shut down Brock Bowers earlier this week.Crosby, 28, has remained loyal to the Raiders, signing a three-year, $106.5 million extension this past offseason, even though they have made the playoffs just once since he arrived as a 2019 fourth-round pick. The five-time Pro Bowler rarely comes off the field and did not miss a game during his first five seasons in the league. He had played through this most recent injury since Week 7. He is outstanding against both the run and the pass. Over the last five seasons, he is eighth in sacks, third in pressures and second in tackles for loss. His 352 tackles are most of any defensive lineman.\nAs recently as the trade deadline, Crosby reportedly wanted to remain in Las Vegas, and Las Vegas wanted to keep him. If either of those feelings have changed due to the most recent developments, though, plenty of potential suitors could emerge.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysDallas inquired about both Crosby and Trey Hendrickson ahead of the trade deadline and got rejected on both accounts before ending up with Quinnen Williams. But Dallas still has extra future draft capital thanks to the Micah Parsons deal. Given the team's win-now offense and struggling defense, Crosby could make sense; he is a more complete player than Hendrickson, and he's also nearly three years younger. Jerry Jones has never been one to shy away from the headlines, and a move like this would certainly generate them.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore RavensThis season especially has shown how badly Baltimore needs an infusion of talent at edge rusher; its 4.6% sack rate would be second-worst in franchise history. The Ravens rarely take a big swing like this, but it's probably time to do so. Crosby fits the team's win-now window, he would provide a much-needed edge rush presence, and he is one of the league's hardest workers, something that would fit well under John Harbaugh. Baltimore has a ton of draft capital, and their draft-and-develop stance at edge rusher simply hasn't been cutting it recently.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersThe Chargers are headed to the playoffs for the second time in two years under Jim Harbaugh, an impressive accomplishment considering the injuries they've sustained and the cap issues they've overcome. The money finally starts freeing up this offseason, and Crosby would be a tremendous fit here. The Chargers still have Khalil Mack playing effectively, and trade acquisition Odafe Oweh has been a pleasant surprise. But Crosby is on another level and would provide not only a game-wreaking pass rush presence but much-needed heft against the run.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cincinnati BengalsThe Bengals fall into a similar category as the Cowboys. They have an elite, explosive offense and a defense that could use as much help as it can get. Whether or not the historically conservative Bengals ownership group would OK a deal like this is another issue, but the need and the fit are certainly there.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe San Francisco 49ers haven't lost since Brock Purdy returned from a toe injury that sidelined him for six games, winning all five of their contests with the 26-year-old back under center. The winning streak has given them a chance to secure the NFC West title for the third time in four years.In order to accomplish that feat, San Francisco (11-4) first must record its sixth consecutive victory when it hosts the NFC North champions Chicago Bears (11-4) at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Cal. at 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday Night Football. The 49ers, who already have clinched a playoff berth, trail the Seahawks (12-3) by one game but opened the season with a 17-13 road triumph over Seattle and concludes the campaign against the Mike Macdonald's squad at home next week.Each of San Francisco's last seven wins have been by double digits. including a 48-27 victory versus the Indianapolis Colts in Week 16. The 49ers are ninth in the NFL in scoring with an average of 26.1 points but have produced at least 34 in four of their past six triumphs.Chicago clinched its fifth NFC North title and first since 2018 with the Green Bay Packers' 41-24 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday. The Bears, who posted a thrilling 22-16 overtime victory over the Packers last week, and the 49ers both still have a chance to overtake the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed in the conference. Six games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Detroit Pistons (24-7) and Los Angeles Clippers (9-21) at 9 p.m. ET at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, Cal. The Pistons fell to 2-1 on their five-game road trip with Friday's 131-129 setback against the Utah Jazz while the Clippers are coming off their third straight victory, a 119-103 triumph over the Portland Trail Blazers.The NHL has five games on its slate, one of which is an Atlantic Division battle between the last-place Toronto Maple Leafs (17-15-5) and first-place Detroit Red Wings (22-14-3) at 7 p.m. ET at Little Caesars Arena. It is the third meeting of the season between the Original Six rivals and first since the Red Wings swept a home-and-home series in October.There also are numerous college basketball games taking place on Sunday, including a West Coast Conference clash between San Francisco (8-5) and Seattle (11-2) at 8 p.m. ET at the Redhawk Center. The Dons have been idle since last Sunday, when they trounced Morgan State by 30 points, while the Redhawks edged UTSA 71-68 the following day for their sixth consecutive victory.The 49ers are 3.5-point favorites against the Bears in the latest consensus NFL odds. The Pistons are 3-point favorites against the Clippers, the Red Wings are -127 favorites on the money line against the Maple Leafs and Seattle is an 2.5-point favorite against San Francisco.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Dec. 28. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchBears at 49ersTime: 8:20 p.m. | Location: Santa Clara, Cal. | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Bears +3.5 (-116) | Expert: Colston Loveland Over 3.5 receptions (-123, PropBetGuy)The 49ers have been winning comfortably of late and rolled past the Bears 38-13 last season without Christian McCaffrey, who is tied for third in the NFL this year with 16 total touchdowns. But Chicago has lost just one game since Week 8, and that was a 28-21 setback at Green Bay in which the Packers snapped a tie with 3:32 remaining in the fourth quarter. Even though they've already won the NFC North, the Bears won't be coasting as they still have a shot at the top seed in the conference. They are 8-2 against the spread in their last 10 games and the SportsLine Projection Model has them covering against San Francisco in 52% of simulations. SportsLine NFL props expert PropBetGuy (+1267 on his last 73 NFL player prop picks) thinks Chicago's Colston Loveland will be involved in the team's aerial attack against a 49ers defense that has struggled to contain opposing tight ends lately.More NFL best betsRaiders +3 (-111, Sportsline model B-rated play)Mike Evans Over 55.5 receiving yards (-114, R.J.

And after only 212 combined points were scored in the opener of their road trip, at least 260 were produced in their last two contests. Detroit's Cade Cunningham (26.5) and Los Angeles' James Harden (26.3) both are averaging more than 26 points, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees them coming close to those numbers and making this game a high-scoring one as its simulations say the Over hits 56% of the time. The Clippers have won each contest during their three-game streak by double digits, and SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (48-41-1 on his last 90 NBA picks) believes they'll at least cover the spread as the Pistons are beginning to appear tired on their road trip.NHL best bets, where to watchMaple Leafs at Red WingsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Maple Leafs +1.5 (-220) | Expert: Red Wings -139 (Matt Severance)The Maple Leafs have followed a three-game losing streak during which they scored a total of four goals by tallying a combined 13 times in back-to-back victories. Detroit posted a pair of overtime victories before suffering a 5-2 road loss against the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday. Toronto also was in action last night and could be without leading scorer William Nylander, who tallied in the team's 7-5 triumph over the Ottawa Senators but exited with an apparent knee injury. But the Maple Leafs will have plenty of motivation for this matchup after dropping 6-3 and 3-2 decisions to the Red Wings in the first week of the season. The SportsLine Projection Model likes the Leafs to keep this meeting close, at worst, as they cover the spread in 69% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (6-2, +385 on his last eight NHL money-line picks) feels Detroit will come away with the win, however, as the possible absence of Nylander and Toronto's lack of success on the road (5-10-0) are too much to overlook.CBB best bets, where to watchSan Francisco at SeattleTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Seattle | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Seattle -145 | Expert: Seattle -2.5 (-108, Bruce Marshall)Seattle hasn't lost since Nov. 29, when it was edged 74-71 by UC Santa Barbara in the championship game of the Resorts World Classic. The Redhawks' only other defeat this season was a two-point setback against Cal Poly three weeks earlier. Both of the Dons' last two contests were double-digit victories, but the SportsLine Projection Model sees the Redhawks extending their winning streak to seven games as its simulations have them winning 64% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (7-3, +370 on his last 10 college basketball picks) agrees and likes Seattle to cover the spread with a balanced offense that has had five different players lead the team in scoring during its current six-game run.\n            ",

Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, Framber Valdez, Cody Bellinger and Ranger Suárez are among the players still on the free agent market, which has been slow to develop. Kyle Schwarber (who returned to the Phillies), Pete Alonso and Edwin Dìaz (who both left the Mets for the Orioles and Dodgers, respectively) all signed during the Winter Meetings in December.Earlier this winter, right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Valdez and Suárez would slot in toward the front of any rotation.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

The move comes with two weeks to go and the Raiders (2-13) eliminated from the playoff race long ago.Bowers, 23, suffered a PCL injury and bone bruise in his left knee in Las Vegas' season-opening win over the New England Patriots. He played through the injury in the team's next three games before missing three games to try to recover from the injury. In his first game back from that absence, he registered 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns.Overall, Bowers finishes the season with 64 receptions for 780 yards and seven touchdowns -- all team highs, but the first two categories significantly down from a historic 112-catch, 1,194-yard debut season. Bowers' 112 receptions were a rookie record, and his 1,194 yards were a rookie tight end record.The Raiders finish the season with games against the New York Giants and against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Week 17 matchup in New York is an important one, as both teams sport 2-13 records, tied for the worst in the NFL. The loser of that game will take over the top spot in the NFL Draft order.\nThe Raiders also placed safety Jeremy Chinn on IR, ending his season as well.\n            \n    ",

It's a modest contract for a pitcher with ample closing experience, which speaks to concerns about the 32-year-old's declining performance the past two years. He's continued to handle the ninth inning capably, but he's gone from striking out about 12 batters per nine innings to less than nine per nine, with a corresponding drop in velocity. The Rays, who of course know him best, actually turned down an $11 million option for him. Still, he'll enter 2026 as the favorite to close for the Marlins, who were never settled in that role last year. Maybe that's manager Clayton McCullough's philosophy, which is all the more reason to be cautious about drafting Fairbanks next year, but even so, he's worth targeting as a low-end RP2. --Scott WhiteWillson Contreras traded to the Red Sox \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        STL\n                    \n                         \n                        St. Louis\n                    \n                                            • #40\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 33\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.257\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    70\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    80\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    142\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nWell, this one's kind of surprising. The Red Sox probably couldn't go into this season relying on Triston Casas again, and now it's not clear if Casas will even be on the Red Sox in 2026. Contreras transitioned to first base in 2025 and continued to be a solid middle-of-the-order bat, hitting 20 homers with a .257/.344/.447 line. Given the money due over the final two seasons of his contract (which includes an option for 2028), the Red Sox aren't likely to consider Contreras a platoon bat with Casas, so I would expect a trade for Casas, who will have some very late-round appeal in Fantasy if he finds an everyday job. As for Contreras, his value takes a big hit as he is only 1B eligible for 2026, but he's a solid enough corner infield option in Fantasy, especially with a nice little park upgrade on the way.  \nAs for the Cardinals side of this, I wonder if this might be a way to unlock everyday at bats for Ivan Herrera, who has hit like a first baseman over the past couple of seasons while playing catcher … like a first baseman. He is recovering from elbow surgery and is expected to play catcher in 2026 after mostly being limited to DH duties last season, but maybe they could give him a few opportunities behind the plate per week while primarily holding down first base and DH. Herrera won't open 2026 with catcher eligibility, but he has significant upside if he gets there and plays regularly coming off a .284/.373/.464 line (with even better underlying numbers).  The Cardinals also added to their rotation options with Hunter Dobbins coming back their way, along with as-yet-unnamed pitching prospects. Dobbins had a 4.13 ERA and 3.99 xERA last season with the Red Sox, and there might be room to unlock some swing-and-miss upside with some tweaks to his arsenal. But he's probably just an end-of-rotation option for the Cardinals and someone Fantasy players can view as strictly a streamer for 2026.Munetaka Murakami signs with the White Sox It's a surprisingly small contract for one of the biggest names on the market. I wrote about that and more here: \n\"MLB teams aren't infallible, and when it comes to a player making the transition from NPB to the majors, there's an inherent uncertainty that makes it harder to say with confidence whether this will end up being a good deal or not. But there are no shortage of teams with the need for a potential 30-plus power hitter in the middle of the lineup, and the fact that Murakami ended up with a similar contract to the ones Jurickson Profar and Tyler O'Neill signed last season (while being significantly older and with pretty mediocre MLB track records) stands out as a pretty big red flag, one Fantasy player shouldn't just ignore.  I'm not going to totally bury him in my rankings but given that the White Sox (and the other 29 teams, frankly) know a whole lot more about Murakami than we do, I am very much inclined to view him with a skeptical eye. We'll get to the scouting report for Murakami shortly, but the long and short of it is there are significant contact questions with his swing that make his likelihood of living up to the loftiest expectations pretty unlikely. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as a prospect if he signed for big money, but with the details in now, it seems like MLB teams just don't have a lot of faith in his swing. If MLB teams are telling us they don't have much more faith in him than they do in Polanco, we should probably listen.\"  --Chris Towers  Shane Baz traded to the Orioles I wrote about Baz's move to Baltimore here:: \"The Orioles are betting they can do something similar here with Baz entering his age-27 season. And there are obviously tools to work with here once you look past the ugly 4.78 ERA Baz put up in 2025. His xERA was 3.85, which suggests there was plenty of poor luck in Baz's results. He has some strikeout upside and limits damage on contact well enough (.359 xwOBA on contact in 2025, .355 for his career; .368 is league average), but has mostly struggled with consistency. \nAnd I think the Rays approach may have something to do with that. Many pitchers have talked about how the Rays philosophy can often be boiled down to, \"Throw your best pitches as often as possible, aim for the middle of the zone', and let your stuff do the rest.\" That is advice that has worked out well for many pitchers (most notably Tyler Glasnow), but I think it's been holding Baz back. He has good stuff, but doesn't necessarily miss as many bats in the strike zone as you would expect, posting a roughly average in-zone contact rate allowed. That's a problem when Baz throws 53% of his pitches in the zone, compared to the league average of roughly 48%. Those pitches in the zone will help you avoid walks, of course, but it's hard to consistently miss bats that way, and consistently missing bats has been a big issue for Baz.\" -- Chris Towers  Brandon Lowe traded to the Rays I wrote about Lowe's fit in Pittsburgh here: \"It is a park downgrade for Lowe, though that may not matter as much as you think –  he hit just .240/.279/.456 at George M. Steinbrenner Field last season, while Tropicana Field (where Lowe played every season prior to last) is actually a worse park for left-handed hitters than PNC Park. PNC is a tougher park for righties and should play pretty fair for Lowe, so your expectations for him shouldn't change too much based on this deal. Which means Lowe should remain one of the best values at the second base position for Fantasy yet again. Despite coming off a bounce-back season, Lowe's ADP in early NFBC drafts is just 174.1. He's being held back by concerns about his health, which is fair, but he just proved last season he can give us something close to a full season, and there just aren't many players who can give you as big an edge on the competition as Lowe does with homers relative to other second basemen.\" -- Chris Towers   \n Michael King signs with Padres The theme of staying put this offseason continues for another notable free agent, and the terms are pretty interesting. In all, the deal could be worth $75 million over three years, but King could choose to opt out after the first or second year, earning the least amount of money upfront. That's the sort of deal a player signs when he thinks he won't get he's worth and needs to resuscitate his value, and to be fair, he did miss much of 2025 with nerve impingement in his shoulder. But he did have his usual velocity when he returned in September, and every contender could use a pitcher like him. \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SD\n                    \n                         \n                        San Diego\n                    \n                                            • #34\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 30\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    5-3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.44\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    73.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    26\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    76\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nIt's reason to wonder if there are lingering doubts about King's ineffectiveness in September. He didn't look as sharp even though the velocity checked out. In all, his move back into the starting rotation in 2024 has been a smashing success, and he has top-25 upside at starting pitcher. Given that the position is so deep, though, and he clearly has something to prove still, he'll come closer to being the 50th starting pitcher selected. --Scott White  Ha-seong Kim signs with Braves Kim turned down his $16 million option with the Braves earlier this offseason but returns for an addition $4 million on a one-year. It's a good fit in that the Braves badly need a shortstop with some offensive ability and Kim badly needs to restore his value after a season wrecked by injuries. He should play every day just as he did in September when the Braves claimed him off waivers from the Rays. \n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 30\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .234\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .649\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    171\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    39\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nWhether he'll perform is another matter. His 2025 was split evenly with 24 games for the Rays and 24 for the Braves, and he did perform better once he was back to playing regularly with the latter. But he also had zero steals with the latter and isn't of much Fantasy interest without those, particularly since he's likely to bat low in the lineup. A 12-homer, 25-steal season is what you could reasonably hope for, with 15 and 30 being his absolute upside, but he's far enough removed from those kind of numbers that you should approach him with skepticism. He's a late-round pick in leagues that require a third middle infielder (such as standard Rotisserie). --Scott White    Adolis Garcia signs with Phillies   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #53\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.227\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    19\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    58\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    75\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    135\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nGarcia, 32, has struggled with issues in both knees and hasn't been an impact hitter since 2023. The Phillies are betting they can unlock something and at least squeeze a mild upgrade from what Nick Castellanos has given them the past few seasons. That's not a bad bet on a one-year, $10 million contract. It's an upgrade in supporting cast and home park, and that could provide a little boost to Garcia's value. But I'm not expecting a George Springer-esque resurgence after two years of an OPS below .700 and declining underlying metrics. Maybe you could get 20 homers and 10 steals out of him as a late-round flier. --Chris Towers      Josh Bell signs with Twins   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Minnesota\n                    \n                                            • #19\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 33\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.237\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    54\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    63\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    88\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nBell's career has been defined by inconsistency, so a bounce-back in 2025 isn't out of the question. That's especially true given his underlying metrics in 2025, which were the best we've seen from him since 2021, with a .358 xwOBA to go along with his best strikeout rate in three years. It didn't show up in the box score until the second half of the season, when Bell hit .267/.353/.489. It's not unreasonable to think there's a similar ceiling in here for 2026, though you certainly shouldn't draft Bell expecting that. As a late-round flier for power, you can do worse, however. --Chris Towers   \n   Merrill Kelly signs with Diamondbacks   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #29\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 37\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    12-9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.52\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    184\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    48\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    167\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nPetty straightforward, this one. Apart from his two months with the Rangers at the end of 2025, our only recollection of Kelly is with the Diamondbacks, so we know exactly what to expect. The only question would be if he's beginning to age out at 37, seeing as he was more hittable during his 10 starts with the Rangers. No organization would have a better read on him than the Diamondbacks, though, and they're willing to pay him $20 million each of the next two years. His velocity and ERA estimators have held steady, so I think you can draft him with confidence as an innings-eating rotation stabilizer in the fifth or sixth starter range. You'll probably end up using him more than you expect to. --Scott White      Isaac Collins traded to Royals   For a minute there, Collins was the hot thing in Fantasy, slashing .338/.425/.544 over a two-month stretch from June 12 through Aug. 11. And while he slashed only .182/.303/.293 thereafter, slipping into more of a part-time role, he still ended up reaching base at a .368 clip as a rookie. That's likely what attracted the Royals to Collins, and with them, the switch-hitter is more likely to play every day.   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        KC\n                    \n                         \n                        Kansas City\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .263\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OBP\n                                    \n                                    .368\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .779\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    372\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nMy fear, though, is that the midseason hot stretch inflated his stat line beyond what's actually reasonable and that the season simply ended before the correction could be fully applied. He wasn't a highly regarded prospect, doesn't hit the ball with much authority, and doesn't make contact at an unusually high rate. He's good at taking walks, as his minor league history also shows, but major league pitchers will put a stop to that if the bat isn't impactful enough. They're better at controlling where the ball goes and will simply pound the strike zone. Maybe Collins will excel with the Royals and give them their own version of Sal Frelick. It's more possible with them than with the Brewers. But that's modest upside for a player with such a questionable profile, making him not worth considering outside of five-outfielder leagues. --Scott White   \n   \tDustin May signs with Cardinals   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        STL\n                    \n                         \n                        St. Louis\n                    \n                                            • #85\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    7-11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.96\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.42\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    132.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    123\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nNot a bad gamble for the Cardinals when you consider that May was a prized commodity as recently as a year ago. He was coming back from flexor tendon surgery as well as a Tommy John revision, and obviously, things didn't turn out so well. The Dodgers decided to cut bait, shipping him to the Red Sox for a couple of minor leaguers, but it didn't improve his circumstances at all. If nothing else, the Cardinals can provide him with opportunity given the sorry state of their starting rotation. He's lost about 2 mph from all three versions of his fastball (four-seamer, two-seamer and cutter), but he still gets wicked horizontal movement on several of his pitches. He's too much of a project to draft in standard-size leagues, but if he starts getting some buzz this spring, that could change. --Scott White    \tKenley Jansen signs with Tigers   It wasn't even a week ago that I said Kyle Finnegan would be the favorite for saves in Detroit after signing a two-year, $19 million deal.

Jansen presumably wouldn't go to a team that didn't promise him the closer role. The last time he got fewer than 25 saves in a season (2020 excluded) was 2011. It's true he's not as dominant as he once was, but he continues to get the job done at 38 and has a good chance for 30-plus saves on an expected contender. You should target him among the top 15 relievers in leagues that reward saves. --Scott White   \n   \tJorge Polanco signs with Mets   Out with Pete Alonso. In with ... Jorge Polanco?

He had patellar tendon surgery prior to the season, a condition he had been managing for years, and the underlying data backs up the resurgence, namely through improved exit velocities a greatly improved strikeout rate. In theory, he's going to a better venue, but his xHR by ballpark is about the same in New York and Seattle over the past few years. Mostly, Polanco's value is tied to his second base eligibility, given that it's the weakest infield position, and this move puts him in the conversation for top 10 there. --Scott White        Robert Suarez signs with Braves    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #75\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 34\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    69.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        S\n                                    \n                                    40\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    75\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    2.97\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nKen Rosenthal already answered your question: The Braves still expect to use Raisel Iglesias as their closer in 2026. The deal will pay Suarez $13 million in 2026, with $16 million due in each of 2027 and 2028; with Iglesias only under contract for one more year after re-signing earlier this offseason, the plan here seems pretty clear. For 2026, Suarez is an overqualified setup man; in 2027, he should enter as the odds-on favorite to close. Of course, he might end up closing in 2026 anyway, as Iglesias lost the feel for his slider in 2025 and subsequently lost his job (before eventually winning it back). Winning it back from Suarez, who has a 2.87 ERA and 76 saves over the past two seasons, might be a tougher task. Iglesias remains in the top-12 closer discussion for 2026 drafts, but he's got to be viewed as a riskier pick now than he was before the Suarez signing. --Chris Towers   \n   Pete Alonso signs with Orioles   \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .272\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    38\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    126\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    87\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .871\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    624\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nAfter he sat on the free agent market until February last offseason, Pete Alonso found his home much earlier this time around. And, for the first time in his professional career, he won't be with the Mets, as he landed with the Orioles Wednesday on a five-year deal that will make him one of the highest-paid first basemen in MLB history. It's a move that answers some questions for the Orioles lineup in 2026 and raises plenty more for the Mets.

Basically, they had him throw his splitter twice as often, and clearly, they think those gains will stick. --Scott White          Kyle Schwarber signs with Phillies       \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #12\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    111\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    132\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    197\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nKyle Schwarber returning to the Phillies is a big deal for real-life baseball. Schwarber is one of the 15 or so best hitters in baseball (and the number of better power hitters is an even shorter list), but he's also been an integral part of the Phillies' clubhouse during their recent run of contending, and they were fighting off a number of other contenders and would-be contenders for Schwarber's services. That's a list that included unexpected names like the Reds and Pirates, as well as the Orioles, Mets, and others who were all in on Schwarber to the tune of at least $100 million. His landing spot could have fundamentally reshaped the look of any one of about a half-dozen teams.      For Fantasy, though, this deal doesn't really matter all that much. We'll always take the status quo reigning when that involves an elite hitter staying in a good lineup, and it's probably the best chance Schwarber has to recreate his incredible 2025 season. But it also doesn't – or shouldn't – change how anyone views him for Fantasy. It's the status quo, after all.      I will say this: I think Schwarber's price in drafts is probably at least a little bit unreasonable. After sporting an ADP near 70th entering 2025, he's sitting at 24.5 in early NFBC drafts so far. He was worth that in 2025, but he also hit 18 more homers than he had in 2024 and nine more than any other season in his career, so expecting a repeat is probably asking a lot. He'll hit 40 or so with elite run production numbers, but he hasn't hit better than .248 since 2021 (when he was shielded from many of the toughest lefties on the schedule in a way he no longer is) and he is a Util/DH-only player for Fantasy. None of that should be considered a deal breaker, but it can create some tough team-building complications when it costs a second-round pick. --Chris Towers         Edwin Diaz signs with Dodgers     \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #12\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    111\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    132\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    197\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nEdwin Diaz joining the Dodgers is another move that feels more momentous in real life than in Fantasy. The Dodgers' bullpen was their biggest weakness in 2025 and now they've signed the best closer on the market. Of course they did. But Diaz was going to be a closer no matter where he signed, and if anything, signing with a team that gave out a huge contract to another close last offseason and has other pitchers with closing experience means there might be a bit more risk in drafting Diaz than there was before. He'll probably remain a dominant force and secure 35-plus saves for the Dodgers, but he's volatile enough that it's not impossible to foresee a world in which he loses this job. Remember, it happened to him for a stretch in 2024.      Tanner Scott is obviously undraftable in most leagues now, while Devin Williams seems secure a top-12 closer and a high-profile bounce-back candidate if the Mets stay out of the closer market moving forward. --Chris Towers          \tHarry Ford traded for Jose Ferrer      \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SEA\n                    \n                         \n                        Seattle\n                    \n                                            • #47\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 25\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.48\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.27\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    76.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    71\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThat the Mariners would trade Ford, who has been one of the top catcher prospects from the time he was drafted in 2021, was all but certain given the Cal Raleigh of it all. That they'd get only a blah reliever in return was unexpected. But wait, wasn't Ferrer the Nationals' closer by the end of last season? Yeah, because they traded everyone else away. He throws hard, but the numbers certainly aren't closer-caliber, and even if you want to say his 3.03 FIP is more indicative of his ability than his 4.48 ERA, so what? Left-handers who get ground balls at a high rate, while useful, generally aren't considered top trade currency. The Mariners actually gave up a second minor-leaguer in the deal as well.      \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        WAS\n                    \n                         \n                        Washington\n                    \n                                            • #5\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 22\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Minors\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .283\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OBP\n                                    \n                                    .408\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .868\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    374\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nClearly, Ferrer won't be closing games anymore, so whatever Fantasy value he might have had is now kaput. What about Ford? Well, the Nationals do have Keibert Ruiz locked up through 2030, but he was ravaged by concussions in 2025 and has performed below expectations each of the past two seasons. Unlike Raleigh, he's a catcher that Ford could reasonably overtake. Ford stands out most for his plate discipline, having reached base at a .408 clip in 2025 and a .405 clip for his minor league career, and he has playable pop to his pull side. He had been a prolific base-stealer in the past but put a stop to that in 2025, for some reason. With as deep as catcher is right now, you won't need to make a big play for him even in two-catcher leagues, but that could change if he garners a lot of buzz this spring. --Scott White            \tJhostynxon Garcia traded for Johan Oviedo      \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PIT\n                    \n                         \n                        Pittsburgh\n                    \n                                            • #51\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 23\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Minors\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .267\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .810\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    434\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    45\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    131\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThere were three lesser prospects moved in this deal as well, but we'll stick to the principle players. The Password, as Garcia is commonly known, is a borderline top-100 prospect who got nine plate appearances for the Red Sox last year after a productive showing between Double- and Triple-A. But while power is supposed to be his calling card, he delivered only an 86.4 mph average exit velocity in his 81 games at Triple-A. His home run output relies on him pulling the ball in the air with regularity, and because PNC Park rates as the worst home run venue for right-handed hitters, that's ... kind of a problem. Garcia also had a high chase rate at Triple-A, not to mention a high miss rate on pitches in the zone, so there are ample reasons for skepticism here, even if this traded offers him a much clearer path to playing time.      \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #24\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 27\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    2-1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.57\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    40.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    23\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    42\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nOviedo also strikes me as more of a curiosity than a true asset. His nine starts late in 2025 at least showed him to be healthy after a lengthy recovery from Tommy John surgery, but the outings were short, with only one exceeding five innings, and the 3.57 ERA was undercut by a 4.92 FIP. While he shows some potential as a bat-misser, it's not nearly enough to make up for his vulnerability to walks and home runs, and my guess is that he'll serve more as a swingman than a full-time starter for the Red Sox. --Scott White             \tEmilio Pagan signs with Reds       \"My guess today is that Pagan does not sign as a closer.\" That's what I said on the Fantasy Baseball Today podcast Monday night.

It obviously did in 2025, seeing him recording 32 saves with a 2.88 ERA. But it marked only the second time in six years that he had an ERA below 4.40, and he remained as homer-prone as ever, which accounts for the 3.72 FIP and 3.91 xFIP. Pitching in Cincinnati should only exacerbate those home run problems, and just because he dodged a bullet the first time doesn't mean he will again. He deserves to be drafted among the top 20 relievers, just because there are only so many in line for saves, but there's definite bust potential. --Scott White        \tCedric Mullins signs with Rays    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #28\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .216\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .690\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    435\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nMullins' production has been in decline for a while now and hit rock bottom when he batted .182 with a .565 OPS after joining the Mets in a midseason trade. But he's still a plus defender in center field (which is more than can be said for Chandler Simpson), his exit velocities have held fairly steady even with the diminished production, and he just delivered a career-high pull-air rate. There are worse gambles a thrifty club could make than to ink a former 30/30 man to a one-year, $7 million deal. My best guess is that Mullins fits into some kind of platoon and puts up usable power/speed numbers for a five-outfielder league. Seeing as he's a career .189 hitter with a .519 OPS at Tropicana Field, though, I'd be more likely to adjust those expectations down than up. --Scott White           \tAnthony Kay signs with White Sox       Early December is apparently the time to shop for failed major league pitchers who rehabilitated their value in East Asia, because Kay becomes the third such player to sign in two days.

He's now primarily sinker/cutter rather than fastball/slider, becoming the sort of extreme ground-ball pitcher (56 percent rate in 2025) that can overcome a modest strikeout rate, and has a much broader arsenal in general. He's unlikely to be much more than a streamer in Fantasy, particularly pitching for a non-contender like the White Sox, but as with every pitcher who takes this career path, there is the potential for a surprise. --Scott White              \tCody Ponce signs with Blue Jays       After an unremarkable stint with the Pirates earlier in the decade, Ponce spent a few years refining his game overseas, and it culminated with him earning MVP honors in the Korean Baseball Organization last year. The award is easy to understand given the numbers, but what's behind those numbers? Apparently, he's added 2 mph to his fastball since we last saw him in 2021, and he's also added a kick change (sometimes identified as a splitter) that produces incredible tumbling action with its minimal spin (often below 1,000 rpm). Though he also has a sweeper, it's the fastball and changeup that primarily account for his 12.6 K/9, the highest for any former MLB pitcher coming back from the KBO.       \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TOR\n                    \n                         \n                        Toronto\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 KBO\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    17-1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    1.89\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.94\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    180.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    41\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    252\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Blue Jays are making a reasonable-sized commitment, too. Three years, $30 million, while having the potential to make him a bargain, isn't stab-in-the-dark money. They're convinced Ponce can hold down a rotation spot for them, and I'm convinced he'll at least be viable in Fantasy, with his core components suggesting even better than that. Still, the 2026 starting pitcher crop is deep enough in upside plays that I couldn't justify using more than a late-round pick on him. --Scott White              \tRyan Weiss signs with Astros       \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #69\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 29\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 KBO\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    16-5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    2.87\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.02\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    178.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    207\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nA former fourth-round pick of the Diamondbacks, Weiss wasn't good enough to reach the majors before departing for Korea in 2024, but after putting together impressive numbers there in 2025 (see above), he'll get a chance to compete for a spot in the Astros rotation on a one-year, $2.6 million deal. That's not a great financial commitment, obviously, which suggests that a market failed to develop for the soon-to-be 29-year-old. Between that and the lack of clear explanations for Weiss' breakthrough (beyond vague references to improved command and a broader secondary arsenal), I'm inclined to think it was less about Weiss himself than his competition. He may have stretches when he's streamable, but barring some eye-opening performance this spring, he should go largely undrafted in Fantasy. --Scott White               \tDevin Williams signs with Mets        The Bronx chewed up and spit out Williams, heretofore a lockdown ace of a closer, but surely the other New York borough will makes for a gentler landing. Or ... not at all. In fact, this deal offers little in the way of closure because the Mets' mountain of resources allows them to pursue another big-dollar reliever, up to and including Edwin Diaz, who would of course take precedence over Williams in the ninth inning. But the Mets are paying Williams closer money -- three years, $45 million, along with additional incentives -- so for now, let's presume he's their closer.        \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

His pitches all had the same shape and velocity. He missed bats at his usual elite rate. His 3.11 xERA and 2.68 FIP were both much lower than his 4.79 ERA. He was basically the same pitcher. The results were just worse. Normally, you'd bet on a rebound in that scenario, and I still think that's the right move, which is why I rank him just inside my top 12 relievers. But I'd feel better had he signed somewhere else. --Scott White                \tRyan Helsley signs with Orioles        While some teams were reportedly eyeing Helsley as a rotation candidate, the Orioles plan to use him as a closer with Felix Bautista (shoulder) expected out for the majority of 2016. Helsley was a great closer not so long ago, registering 49 saves with a 2.04 ERA in 2024, but he was not so great or even a closer when last we saw him, putting together a 7.20 ERA in 22 appearances for the Mets following a midseason trade from the Cardinals.        \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #56\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.50\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.54\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    56\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    63\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nAfter getting to the root of the problem, which was apparently a tell in his delivery, he finished his Mets tenure with seven scoreless innings, and the Orioles evidently felt assured enough give him a two-year, $28 million deal. It's not the sort of contract that an ace reliever who's entirely worry-free would get, but it's a robust commitment nonetheless. With the Orioles expected back in playoff contention, you should anticipate drafting Helsley in the 12-15 range at relief pitcher. He's has the potential to be top five. --Scott White                 Dylan Cease signs with Blue Jays         \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TOR\n                    \n                         \n                        Toronto\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 29\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    168\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W\n                                    \n                                    8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    215\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.55\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.33\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n$210 million is a lot of money for a pitcher coming off a 4.55 ERA. But as I wrote in my more in-depth breakdown of the signing, that ERA doesn't come close to telling the whole story with Cease. Yes, he's frustratingly inconsistent. He's also a true workhorse, taking the ball every fifth day and providing volume and strikeouts. With ERA and WHIP risk, sure, but there's obviously plenty of upside there, too. He's going off the board in early drafts around 80th overall, as the 20th SP off the board or thereabouts, and that seems like a perfect fine value for a guy with his mixture of upside and projectable volume. There aren't many pitchers whose absolute best-case scenario is as enticing for Fantasy as Cease's. --Chris Towers                    Sonny Gray traded to Red Sox            \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #54\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 36\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    180.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K's\n                                    \n                                    201\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    4.28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.23\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Red Sox have been expected to make a big splash in either free agency or in the trade market for a rotation upgrade, and this trade might be it. Gray struggled to a 4.28 ERA and 1.23 WHIP last season, but his underlying metrics were more indicative of a top-of-rotation arm, including a 26.7% strikeout rate, 3.39 FIP and 3.29 SIERA. The 36-year-old has seen his velocity decline in consecutive seasons, however, and his quality of contact metrics took a big step back in 2025, which is why his xERA was a more pedestrian 3.90 mark. He's a solid pitcher, both for the Red Sox and for Fantasy, but I don't think he's a needle-mover in either instance at this point in his career, even if the Red Sox might be able to get him in their pitching lab and squeeze some extra value out of him. There's still room for the Red Sox to upgrade this rotation, in other words. --Chris Towers                    Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke traded to Cardinals           In exchange for Gray, the Cardinals got a couple of interesting younger arms. Fitts is more of a known quantity, and he hasn't given us much reason to be excited. He had a 5.00 ERA with even worse peripherals in 2025, so while he might slide into the Cardinals rotation, it'll mostly be for a lack of better options.  Clarke is the more interesting long-term project, with a fastball that can touch 100 mph and a slider that is already a weapon. The rest of the arsenal is a work in progress. He walked 27 in just 38 innings across two levels of A-Ball in 2025, so this is a real project. If all comes together, he might be able to hack it as a starter, but he looks more like a Ryan Helsley-in-waiting type of high-leverage bullpen arm in the long run.           The other thing worth noting here is that, with Gray out of the picture and Miles Mikolas leaving via free agency, there are multiple holes in the Cardinals rotation right now. Prospects Quinn Mathews and Tink Hence have experience in the high minors and could be options for the 2026 rotation, though both have troublesome 2025 campaigns that could lead the team to want to see more success at Triple-A before they make that call. For Fantasy, those are both names to know heading into spring training in case they can steal rotation spots. Liam Doyle, a 2025 first-round pick, seems likely to be more of a midseason consideration after he threw just 3 2/3 post-draft innings in the pros, but he could absolutely be a fast riser early in 2026, too. --Chris Towers                     Marcus Semien traded for Brandon Nimmo            \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEX\n                    \n                         \n                        Texas\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .262\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    92\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    81\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .760\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nThe Mets and Rangers continued the early offseason trend of trading major leaguers for other major leaguers in an exchange of two aging ones with multiple years remaining on their deals.

He's joining a worse lineup that plays in a worse venue, but any changes to his production would be slight, presuming good health.            \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

That's my biggest takeaway from this trade, but Chris Towers has written a complete breakdown of it, which you can find here. --Scott White                        \tRaisel Iglesias signs with Braves            \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #26\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 35\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SV\n                                    \n                                    29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.00\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    67.1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    73\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nIglesias re-ups for one year at exactly the same rate ($16 million) as the previous three. Clearly, the Braves were looking for continuity, and that makes the analysis here rather easy. He's the closer again for an expected contender and a near lock for 30 saves, provided he stays healthy. He missed that number by one in 2025, mostly because of some early-season struggles. Once he cut back on his slider, though, he was clearly back to form, compiling a 1.25 ERA, 0.69 WHIP and 10.0 K/9 in his final 45 appearances. That'll play, all right, and positions Iglesias to be one of the first 12 relievers off the board in 2026. --Scott White                         \tGrayson Rodriguez traded for Taylor Ward             \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #3\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .228\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    36\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    103\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    86\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .792\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    579\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nWhat a fall for Rodriguez, who was regarded a couple years ago as one of the game's burgeoning aces after a multi-year run as a top-10 overall prospect. Now, the Orioles have dealt him away for one year of some 32-year-old outfielder who just hit .228. That's not entirely fair to Ward, who also connected for 36 home runs in 2025, but most projections have him regressing to 25-30 in 2026. He's also joining a team that's loaded with solid-but-less-than-All-Star-worthy corner bats. There already wasn't room in the lineup for all of Dylan Beavers, Samuel Basallo, Coby Mayo, Tyler O'Neill and Ryan Mountcastle. Now, there's room for one fewer. It won't be Ward, but does that mean we'll have to wait even longer for Basallo to contribute in Fantasy? If so, that's a bummer.             \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAA\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

The lat has been a recurring problem, also costing Rodriguez time in 2024 and as a minor leaguer in 2022, and the elbow required debridement surgery in August. The Orioles only made this deal because they couldn't trust him to stay healthy, but having said that, he wouldn't be the first pitcher to overcome a multi-year injury trend and still go on to meet his potential. We have no evidence that his stuff has diminished with this latest rash of injuries, so I'm still inclined to rank him as a top 75 starting pitcher for 2026. This trade is sure to give some drafters pause even at that late stage, though.  --Scott White                          \tTrent Grisham signs with Yankees             Grisham's decision to accept the qualifying offer is a curious one given that he just had far and away his best season, homering 34 times as the primary center fielder for the Yankees. Some major outlets were projecting him to receive a four- or five-year deal for a similar annual value as the qualifying offer, but his agent probably has a better read on the market.             \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYY\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

You might think the return to Yankee Stadium will help, given that he's a left-handed batter, but he actually hit two-thirds of his home runs on the road. If the Yankees are serious about giving Jasson Dominguez regular playing time next year and also bringing back Cody Bellinger, Grisham may be fighting for at-bats again. The Yankees still make for a better landing than a lot of clubs, but you can understand why drafters might approach Grisham with some skepticism in 2026. --Scott White                          \tGleyber Torres signs with Tigers             \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DET\n                    \n                         \n                        Detroit\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 29\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .256\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    74\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    79\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .745\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    532\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nA modest showing by Torres in 2025 led him to accept the Tigers' qualifying offer rather than testing the free agent market, and you might think a return to Comerica Park is a bad move for his Fantasy value given its reputation. But it actually played well for right-handed hitters in 2025, and Torres batted .285 with a .449 slugging percentage there compared to .223 and .327 on the road. On balance, he performed well below his .271 xBA and .452 xSLG, having delivered his best average exit velocity in three years and some of his best walk and strikeout numbers ever, so some better luck would go a long way toward redeeming him in Fantasy. He's not a surefire top-12 choice, though, even at a position as thin as second base. --Scott White                          \tBrandon Woodruff signs with Brewers             \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIL\n                    \n                         \n                        Milwaukee\n                    \n                                            • #53\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    7-2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    0.91\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    64.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    83\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nSomething tells me that if Woodruff hadn't gone into the offseason nursing a lat injury, he wouldn't have had to accept the Brewers' qualifying offer, instead pursuing a multi-year deal. But now, he's back in prove-it mode after already overcoming a more significant shoulder injury in near miraculous fashion. Even though the shoulder capsule surgery that he underwent in 2023 took 3 mph off his fastball -- normally a career-ender for a pitcher, particularly one so fastball-reliant -- he basically picked up where he left off statistically, even delivering the best strikeout rate of his career. A new cutter is largely to credit for saving him, and his fortunes rose and fell with its usage. He'll be plenty motivated now that he's pitching for a contract again, but he would have been worth selecting among the top 36 starting pitchers either way.  --Scott White                           \tShota Imanaga signs with Cubs              The Cubs' decision to decline Imanaga's three-year, $57.5 million option after the season makes more sense now that we see the way everything played out. They probably suspected he'd accept the $22.025 million qualifying offer, which he did, so now they still have him but without the multi-year commitment.             \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHC\n                    \n                         \n                        Chi.

It's sort of misleading to call it his sophomore season given that he's 32, and his age contributed to those fears of decline as well. Still, he was effective when healthy, remaining a standout for WHIP in particular. No one will mistake him for an ace in 2026, but he should be drafted in the middle rounds. --Scott White                                          \tJosh Naylor signs with Mariners             Normally, a hitter signing with the Mariners wouldn't be the most favorable outcome given T-Mobile Park's reputation as a pitcher-friendly venue.

His 11 stolen bases in 93 games with the Diamondbacks were surprising enough, but then he had 19 in just 54 games with the Mariners. Given his 3rd percentile sprint speed, some other team might have put a stop to that, but the Mariners don't seem to care. He was succeeding, after all. It's doubtful he steals 30 again, which is why he remains only eighth in my first base rankings, but a return to the Mariners improves Naylor's chances of remaining a base-stealer in some capacity.

    "body": "\nThe 2025 NFL Christmas schedule concludes with a \"Thursday Night Football\" AFC West battle of teams in a surprising position as the Kansas City Chiefs host the Denver Broncos. The Broncos (12-3) lead the entire AFC and are chasing a top seed and a bye in the NFL playoffs. Kansas City, meanwhile, has been eliminated from the playoff picture. Kansas City is starting Chris Oladokun at quarterback after losing Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew to knee injuries in consecutive weeks. Kickoff from GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City is set for 8:15 p.m. ET. The latest Broncos vs. Chiefs odds have Denver favored by 13.5 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 36.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook. Before making any Chiefs vs. Broncos picks, check out the NFL predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 17 on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, the model has set its sights on Chiefs vs. Broncos.

Kansas City has been decimated by injuries at quarterback, but still has star power in tight end Travis Kelce, defensive lineman Chris Jones, receiver Xavier Worthy and others. Even in a the midst of a lost season, they'll be highly-motivated to avoid a blowout at the hands of their division rivals in the national spotlight. Denver is just 2-5 against the spread on the road and it only has two double-digit wins this season. The Broncos are also coming off a poor showing against the Jaguars, losing 34-20 despite being 3.5-point favorites in that Week 16 matchup. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverDenver has more to play for as the Broncos have the inside track for the top seed in the AFC side of the NFL playoff bracket. The Broncos already beat the Chiefs 22-19 last month, and that was when Kansas City had Mahomes and was still in contention, so a much bigger margin could be in play in this one. The Chiefs are just 5-10 overall this season against the spread. They are also just 1-7 ATS against quality opponents (teams that have won 55% or more of games) 0-7 ATS against teams that give up fewer than 21 points per game. Denver ranks fifth in the NFL in scoring defense (19.7 ppg), fourth in the NFL in total defense (291.6 ypg) and leads the league in total sacks (63) by a wide margin, making life extremely tough on a quarterback with virtually no experience. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Chiefs vs. Broncos picksSportsLine's model has simulated Broncos vs. Chiefs 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 36 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits 60% of the time. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Broncos vs. Chiefs, and which side of the spread hits in 60% of simulations?

The Lions have won five of the last six matchups, but their spread success goes back beyond that. Detroit sports a 9-1 ATS record versus Minnesota over their last 10 meetings. Additionally, there's no greater discrepancy between these teams than what's arguably the most important statistic in football, and that's turnovers. The Lions have the fewest giveaways (eight) in the NFL, while the Vikings have the most (29). See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Vikings can coverMinnesota has found its groove as it has both outright won and covered in three straight games. The defense has been the catalyst as it had a season-high-tying of five sacks in Sunday's win over New York. Minnesota's defense also didn't allow a touchdown in that game, which came two weeks after pitching a shutout of Atlanta. The Vikings are on an amazing run of six straight games without giving up a passing score, and Justin Jefferson finally got going to help out the offense. He's coming off an 85-yard game, which is as many yards that he had over his previous four games combined and is his most yards since Week 5. His success could continue versus Detroit's No. 25 pass defense that has given up the fourth-most passing TDs. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Lions vs. Vikings picksSportsLine's model has simulated Vikings vs. Lions 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

Even with some notable quarterback injuries removing notable names like Patrick Mahomes and J.J. McCarthy from the NFL DFS player pool, the slate is still loaded with high-quality options to target for NFL DFS lineups. Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Jahmyr Gibbs, Justin Jefferson and Travis Kelce are just some of the stars you could consider for your daily Fantasy football lineups.Big names, however, come equipped with big price tags, so you'll have to find balance with more affordable players as well. Those aforementioned QB injuries could make the likes of Chris Oladokun or Max Brosmer value-based Christmas NFL DFS picks. Before making any NFL DFS picks for Christmas, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Prescott going over 1.5 passing touchdowns using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Christmas DayPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for Christmas is rostering Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs at $8,300 on DraftKings and $9,400 on FanDuel. Gibbs ranks third amongst all running backs in Fantasy points for the second straight season. He ranks eighth in scrimmage yards (1,662) and second in total touchdowns (17) ahead of a matchup with a team he has historically dominated. Gibbs has nine touchdowns in five career games versus Minnesota while averaging 97.6 scrimmage yards. The Vikings have also been unable to stop any RBs from hitting paydirt recently as each of the last six offensive TDs that Minnesota has allowed have been to running backs. See who else to roster at SportsLine.You can also bet on Gibbs to go Over 113.5 rushing + receiving yards at DraftKings:\nAnother one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Cowboys wideout George Pickens ($8,800 on FanDuel, $7,300 on DraftKings), who is coming off a 7-130-1 stat line and ranks third in the NFL with 1,342 receiving yards on the season. He's been as consistent as any receiver and has at least 78 yards or a touchdown in 12 of 15 games. He also has a salivating matchup against Washington, which has the No. 26 passing defense, and just two teams have allowed more passing touchdowns. Pickens had 82 yards against the Commanders earlier this year after having 91 yards and a score versus them last season. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.Bet Pickens to go Over 79.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Christmas Day NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Christmas.

    "body": "\nChristmas Day is nearly here, which means presents, quality time with the family and, this year, a three-game NFL slate featuring some iconic rivalry clashes to kick off Week 17. The action begins at 1 p.m. ET with the Cowboys visiting the Commanders, which is followed by the Lions at Vikings at 4:30 p.m. ET before the day concludes with Broncos vs. Chiefs at 8:15 p.m. ET. The first two games will air exclusively on Netflix, while the AFC West clash airs on Prime Video for Thursday Night Football. Here, we preview all three games, share NFL betting lines and odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook and more.Cowboys vs. Commanders (1 p.m. ET)\nThe Cowboys had an ever-so-slight chance at still sneaking into the postseason entering Week 16, but those hopes quickly ended with the Eagles' victory over these Commanders on Saturday. Dallas instead will watch the playoffs from home this year despite having arguably the best offense in the NFL. The Commanders will also be watching games from the couch, which is a major disappointment after a run to the NFC Championship Game last season. Washington was dealt a bad case of the injury bug, namely to quarterback Jayden Daniels and star receiver Terry McLaurin, while the defense was 31st in yards allowed and 27th in points allowed. These teams last met back in October, which resulted in a dominant 44-22 Cowboys win with Dak Prescott tossing three touchdowns and Javonte Williams rushing for 116 yards and a score. This matchup will see the Cowboys at relative full strength, but the Commanders will be without Daniels as the second-year quarterback was shut down for the remainder of the season. Marcus Mariota, who has played quite a bit with Daniels banged up this season, will once again start for Washington. The Cowboys are favored at -7 on the road, while the total is among the highest of the week at 50.5, which should come as no surprise given these teams have struggled mightily on defense this season. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, expects Washington to keep this one close, as it has the Commanders covering in 60% of simulations. Dallas is 7-8 against the spread this year while Washington is 5-10 ATS. Cowboys games usually go Over the total, as that's occurred 11 times in 15 contests. Washington is 8-7 to the Over. New users can bet the spread with the DraftKings promo code to receive $200 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:\nLions vs. Vikings (4:30 p.m. ET)\nThese were the two top teams in the NFC North a year ago, but things have changed a good bit in this division. The Lions have gone from the No. 1 seed in the conference at 15-2 to 8-7 and in serious danger of missing the playoffs altogether this year. Detroit is on the outside looking in right now and needs to win out and have the Packers lose each of the final two weeks of the year. One more Lions loss or one more Packers win eliminates Detroit from postseason contention. As for the Vikings, it's been a tough year after 2024's 14-3 campaign, with Minnesota largely struggling in its adjustment to J.J. McCarthy under center. He's played better of late against some poor defenses, but the Vikings will enter 2026 needing a major step forward from its quarterback.One bright spot for McCarthy this year was leading the Vikings to an upset win over the Lions in Detroit on Nov. 2. The Vikings won that one 27-24, with McCarthy tossing two touchdown passes and rushing for another score. The Lions outgained the Vikings 305-258 but struggled mightily in the run game and lost a fumble. Detroit is a 6-point favorite for Week 17 at DraftKings, and the total sits at 44.5. The SportsLine model has the Lions winning in the majority of simulations and covering the spread 53% of the time. The Lions are 7-8 against the spread in 2025, as are the Vikings. Lions games have gone Over the total 10 times in 15 games this season, while the Vikings are 8-7 to the Over.\nBroncos vs. Chiefs (8:15 p.m. ET)\nThe Chiefs' reign atop the AFC West is over. Kansas City had won the division nine years in a row, but the Chiefs won't even make the postseason this year. Instead, the Broncos enter Week 17 at 12-3 to sit in both first place in the division and atop the AFC standings as the current No. 1 seed. Denver is looking to secure homefield advantage over these final two weeks, while three teams are right behind at 11-4, including the Chargers, who face the Broncos next week in a game that may very well decide both the AFC West and the race for the top seed in the conference. The Broncos took down the Chiefs 22-19 on Nov. 16, but that was a very different Kansas City team. Those Chiefs still had something to play for, and they also still had Patrick Mahomes under center. The star quarterback tore his ACL two weeks ago in a loss to the Chargers, and his backup, Gardner Minshew, then tore his ACL in a Week 16 blowout loss to the Titans. The frontrunner to start this week is Chris Oladokun, a former seventh-round pick who saw his first taste of NFL action last week. Assuming Oladokun gets the nod, his first NFL start would come against the No. 5-ranked scoring defense in the NFL. Denver is favored by 13.5 points, while the total sits at just 36.5. The SportsLine model does think the Chiefs will cover here, though, as that occurs in nearly 60% of model simulations. Neither team has impressed against the spread this season, with Denver 6-9 ATS and Kansas City 5-10. The Chiefs are 4-11 to the Over while Denver is 7-8. Bet the spread at DraftKings and receive $200 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Athletes across multiple sports are getting in the holiday spirit, with many gifting their teammates lavish items. These players drop thousands, sometimes even ten or hundreds of thousands, to show their appreciation of the other players in their locker room.In the NFL, it has been a tradition for quarterbacks to give their offensive linemen gifts as a thank you for protecting them all season. With the holidays upon us, multiple quarterbacks have presented gifts to their teammates.Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes' season may be over due to a torn ACL, but that didn't stop him from going all out for his o-line. He gave them all a Hublot watch, Beats Studio Pro headphones, an indoor golf simulator, Oakley AI sunglasses, a suitcase and an e-bike.The linemen were all smiles receiving the luxury items.\n\nBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen carried over the team motto \"everybody eats\" into his gifts. He gave them all a grill and some meat, specifically a quarter of a cow, to put on the grill.\nThe Detroit Lions offensive linemen were clearly on the \"nice\" list this year. Quarterback Jared Goff had golf carts waiting for his lineman, who were as giddy as little kids on Christmas, testing out their new wheels right away. \nGolf carts were clearly a popular gift this year and Dallas Mavericks' Kyrie Irving got the memo. The team hopped in the carts right away, with some even testing the suspension with some off-roading. Irving told his team they looked great in the custom carts and added that he would ship them to each of their homes.The team then drove the carts around town, telling people to come to their games.\nLos Angeles Lakers' Luka Doncic set his squad up with e-bikes. He not only bought his teammates the bikes, but purchased over 100 total for the staff as well. \n\n\nWNBA star Caitlin Clark gave shoes to the Butler men's basketball team, where her boyfriend, Connor McCaffrey, is an assistant coach.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season has been full of drama, but that drama might not carry over into the final week of the season. Heading into Week 17, there are still four playoff spots up for grabs and seven division races that haven't been decided, which seems like a recipe for a dramatic finish over the final two weeks. The problem for the NFL is that there's a nightmare scenario where almost every division race comes to an end and every playoff spot gets clinched in Week 17 and it's a scenario that's not too far-fetched. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, there has never been a season where EVERY playoff spot and EVERY division was clinched before the final week of the season, so this would definitely be an unwanted situation by the NFL. Let's break down the NFL's nightmare scenario: AFC WESTThere are two notable games with playoff implications in the AFC West this weekend: Broncos at ChiefsTexans at ChargersHow the division race could end this week: A Denver win on Christmas Day combined with a Chargers loss to Houston would clinch the AFC West for the Broncos. \nAFC NORTHThere are two games in the AFC North that could lead to the division race ending: Ravens at PackersSteelers at BrownsHow the division race could end this week:  A win by Green Bay would clinch a playoff spot for the Packers AND it would also clinch the AFC North for the Steelers. That seems like the kind of result that would cause a nightmare for the NFL, so let's assume that happens. AFC SOUTHThere are two big games happening in the AFC South in Week 17: Texans at ChargersJaguars at Colts Breakdown: In our nightmare scenario for the NFL, we have the Texans beating the Chargers, so there's no way the Jaguars would be able to clinch the division in Week 17. \nAFC EASTThe Patriots could win the AFC East this week. Let's check out the two games that will have an impact on the division race: Patriots at JetsEagles at BillsHow the division race could end this week: If the Patriots beat the Jets and the Bills lose to Philadelphia, then New England will clinch the division title, and that's exactly what we're going to have happen in our nightmare scenario. Now, let's head to the NFC. There are only three division races going on in this conference because the Eagles have already clinched the NFC East. \nNFC NORTHThe Bears are the only team that has clinched a playoff spot in the NFC North, but that could change this week: Bears at 49ersRavens at PackersHow the division race could end this week: The Bears will win the division with a win over the 49ers while the Packers can clinch a playoff spot with a win over the Ravens. In our nightmare scenario, we'll say the Bears beat the 49ers and the Packers beat the Ravens. (The Lions are still alive in the playoff race, but we're not going to worry about them here. If they lose to the Vikings on Christmas, they'll be eliminated. Even if they win on Christmas, they'd still be eliminated on Saturday if Green Bay beats Baltimore). NFC SOUTHThere are two huge games happening in the NFC South this week: Seahawks at PanthersBuccaneers at DolphinsHow the division race could end this week: The Panthers will win the division with a win over the Seahawks combined with a Dolphins win over the Buccaneers and for the sake of our nightmare scenario, we'll assume that happens. \nNFC WESTThe NFC West already has three playoff teams and all three teams can still clinch the No. 1 overall seed. Here's a look at the big games in this division in Week 17: Seahawks at PanthersBears at 49ersRams at Falcons Breakdown: For the sake of our nightmare scenario, we'll say the Seahawks and 49ers both lose while the Rams win. If all of this happens, six of the eight division races would be decided and all 14 playoff spots would be clinched, which would certainly be a nightmare scenario heading into Week 18. \nHere's what the playoff standings would look like if our nightmare scenario played out in Week 17:  AFC1. Broncos -- AFC West winner2. Patriots -- AFC East winner3. Jaguars -- AFC South leader4. Steelers -- AFC North winner5. Texans -- Clinched playoff spot6. Chargers -- Clinched playoff spot7. Bills -- Clinched playoff spotNFC1. Bears -- NFC North winner2. Rams -- NFC West leader3. Eagles -- NFC East winner4. Panthers -- NFC South winner5. Seahawks -- Clinched playoff spot6. 49ers -- Clinched playoff spot7. Packers -- Clinched playoff spot\nThe NFL doesn't announce the Week 18 schedule until Week 17 is over and with this scenario, it would be almost impossible to come up with an entertaining schedule for the final week of the season. The league needs a doubleheader for Saturday and a prime-time game for Sunday, but there wouldn't be a single game with a \"win-and-in\" scenario. The No. 1 seed in both the NFC and AFC would be up for grabs, so the NFL would likely focus on those. You could put Chargers-Broncos in the Sunday night spot because Denver would likely be playing for the No. 1 seed, but if the Patriots and Jaguars both lost earlier in the day, then the game would mean nothing to Denver. You could put Seahawks-49ers on Sunday night, but if the Rams beat the Cardinals earlier in the day, then L.A. would clinch the NFC West and the Seattle-San Francisco game would only be for wild card seeding. \nYou could put Lions-Bears on Sunday night. Assuming our nightmare scenario plays out in Week 17, the Bears would likely be playing for the No. 1 seed. The NFL doesn't like to put an eliminated team in the Sunday night slot, but it's not unprecedented. In 2022, the Lions were already eliminated but they got scheduled in the Sunday night game against a Packers team that needed a win to get to the playoffs. The Lions had nothing to play for, but they still managed to pull off a 20-16 stunner that kept Green Bay out of the postseason. Of course, the problem with putting Lions-Bears on Sunday night would be that if the Rams lost to Arizona, then the Bears would have already clinched the top seed heading into the game and they'd have nothing to play for. Last year, the final game was between the Lions and Vikings with the winner earning the No. 1 seed in the NFC and the loser getting stuck in the wild card round. The Lions ended up thrashing Minnesota 31-9 to earn the NFC's only bye. A similar scenario could play out this year if both the Seahawks (at Panthers) and 49ers (vs. Bears) win on Sunday. If that happens, the NFC West and No. 1 seed would be on the line when the two teams meet in Week 18. You can bet the NFL would love to see that scenario and not the nightmare one I put together here. \n            ",

We have the Hawaii Bowl to look forward to tonight and a slate of NBA and NFL action set for tomorrow. We'll preview all of that action in today's newsletter, take a quick break on Christmas Day and return to our regularly scheduled programming on Dec. 26 with a look ahead to the weekend. Let's go!  🎄 Five things to know Wednesday NFL Week 17 opens with a Christmas tripleheader. Things could get lopsided on Thursday as the Cowboys, Lions and Broncos are favored over their respective opponents by at least a touchdown. The sizable spreads are unsurprising considering the Commanders, Vikings and Chiefs have all been eliminated from playoff contention and will be rolling with backup quarterbacks. Speaking of the playoffs, the Packers can clinch a spot in the postseason even though they do not play until Saturday. A Lions loss or tie would secure a playoff berth for Green Bay.The NBA's Christmas schedule features five marquee matchups. The matinee between the Spurs and Thunder headlines the slate, but there is not a bad game on the schedule as projected playoff teams and hopefuls go head-to-head over 10 nonstop hours of basketball. LeBron James makes his 20th Christmas game appearance when the Lakers host the Rockets, and three other showdowns round out the day: Knicks vs. Cavaliers, Warriors vs. Mavericks and Nuggets vs. Timberwolves.Travis Kelce headlines the 2026 NFL Pro Bowl Games rosters. The Chiefs tight end led the fan vote for the second consecutive season and earned his 11th career Pro Bowl nod. The Broncos, Ravens, 49ers and Seahawks tied for the league lead with six selections apiece while the Jets, Vikings and Saints did not have any players picked. See the full rosters for the event, which for the first time takes place at the site of the Super Bowl and is set for Tuesday, Feb. 3.J.J. McCarthy will miss Week 17 with a broken hand. The Vikings quarterback sustained a hairline fracture on his throwing hand, which will keep him out of the Christmas Day matchup against the Lions. Max Brosmer is in line to make his second career start and first since Week 13 when the Vikings lost in shutout fashion to the Seahawks. McCarthy already missed six games this season with a high ankle sprain and concussion and missed his entire rookie year with a torn meniscus.The Hawai'i Bowl is on deck after Tuesday's three-game slate. Louisville opened a bowl season tripleheader with a victory in the Boca Raton Bowl, Western Kentucky won the New Orleans Bowl and Ohio put a bow on the Tuesday action with a Frisco Bowl triumph. The Hawai'i Bowl is next up and is the only major sporting event scheduled for Wednesday, so we'll have our attention locked on California and Hawai'i as they square off in Honolulu. 🎅 Do not miss this: Naughty or nice? Sorting out the projected NFL playoff teams as Super Bowl pretenders or contenders \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Not all of the 14 projected NFL playoff teams are actually capable of winning the Super Bowl. In fact, there is a very good chance that not all of them even make the postseason. While most of the current top seven teams in both conferences are legitimate contenders -- they have winning records for a reason -- some have major flaws that will stand in the way of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Zach Pereles put that into festive terms for us, categorizing the contenders and pretenders by their status on Santa Claus' nice list and naughty list: \nNice: Broncos, Patriots, Jaguars, Chargers, Bills, Texans, Seahawks, 49ers, Rams, PackersNaughty: Steelers, Bears, Eagles, PanthersThe Super Bowl pretenders can expect lumps of coal in their stockings. Sorry, Eagles, not everyone can receive presents two years in a row.  📈📉 Pete Prisco's Week 17 NFL Power Rankings \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The Jaguars' convincing victory over the Broncos precipitated a significant shakeup in the upper echelon of Pete Prisco's NFL Power Rankings, including the introduction of a new No. 1 team to fill Denver's spot.

    "body": "\n        Just two weeks are left in the 2025 NFL regular season, but there's still plenty left to be sorted out with the impact of each remaining game seemingly rising by the week. Fourteen teams are eliminated from playoff contention, and just two playoff spots in each conference are still up for grabs. However, seven of the NFL's eight division titles have yet to be claimed. Here's how the AFC standings have shaken out with just two weeks left to play: Denver Broncos (12-3, lead AFC West, clinched playoff berth)New England Patriots (12-3, lead AFC East, clinched playoff berth)Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4, lead AFC South, clinched playoff berth)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6, lead AFC North)Los Angeles Chargers (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Buffalo Bills (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Houston Texans (10-5)Indianapolis Colts (8-7)Baltimore Ravens (7-8)Here's how the NFC standings stack up with the defending Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles being the first team in 2025 to clinch a division title. Both the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers can only reach the postseason as the NFC South champion, and the Detroit Lions can only make the playoffs as the No. 7 seed. Seattle Seahawks (12-3, lead NFC West, clinched playoff berth)Chicago Bears (11-4, lead NFC North, clinched playoff berth)  Philadelphia Eagles (10-5, clinched NFC East)Carolina Panthers (8-7, lead NFC South)San Francisco 49ers (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Los Angeles Rams (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)Detroit Lions (8-7)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)With so many permutations remaining, here is a look at some of the most impactful games of the Week 17 slate as they relate to the postseason, plus a battle for the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick.\n        \n            \n                NFL facing possible nightmare playoff scenario in Week 17 that could kill the drama in final week of season\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThursday (Christmas Day)Lions (8-7) at Vikings (7-8)The Detroit Lions enter Week 17 with just a 5.1% chance to reach the postseason, according to CBS' SportsLine model because they need a lot to go their way. They need to win out at the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas and then knock off the NFC North-leading Bears in Chicago in Week 18. Even if they win out, they also need the Green Bay Packers to lose in Week 17 when they host the Baltimore Ravens and in Week 18 at the Minnesota Vikings. That's their only path back to the postseason. \nGetting swept by the Packers and losing five of their last eight games since returning from their bye week in Week 9 has put the Lions in a precarious position. Good news for Detroit is Minnesota will be starting backup quarterback Max Brosmer in place of the injured J.J. McCarthy, who suffered a hand injury in Week 16. Brosmer threw four interceptions in a 26-0 loss at the Seattle Seahawks back in Week 13. Broncos (12-3) at Chiefs (6-9)The Denver Broncos can clinch the AFC West division this week with a win, plus a Los Angeles Chargers defeat against the Houston Texans. Denver will be blessed with the opportunity to face Chiefs third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, a 2022 seventh-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who spent the last four seasons on Kansas City's practice squad, in his first career start. SaturdayTexans (10-5) at Chargers (11-4)The Houston Texans can return to the playoffs for the third year in a row by simply beating the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium or by the Indianapolis Colts losing against the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. An AFC West title is still on the table for the Chargers, who can knock off the Broncos in Week 18 by winning against the Texans on Saturday before facing Denver in their final regular-season game. \nThis game features two of the hottest teams in the league with Houston earning victories in 10 of its last 12 games and Los Angeles winning seven of its last eight games. This game will come down to which offense can prevail against either the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (the Texans, who are allowing 16.6 points per game) or the NFL's No. 8 scoring defense (the Chargers, who are allowing 20.1 points per game). Ravens (7-8) at Packers (9-5-1)The Baltimore Ravens have a tightrope-like path to the postseason: they can win the AFC North if they beat the Packers and Steelers, while the Steelers lose to the Cleveland Browns in Week 17. Meanwhile, the Green Bay Packers are sitting pretty, by comparison, just needing to win one more game or have the Detroit Lions lose one more game.Saturday night at Lambeau Field will be interesting because both squads have uncertainty about their quarterback situation. Both Lamar Jackson (back) and Jordan Love (concussion) exited their respective team's Week 16 game with injuries. Jackson didn't practice on Tuesday while both Love and his backup Malik Willis (right shoulder) practiced as limited participants. \nSundaySteelers (9-6) at Browns (3-12)The Pittsburgh Steelers can win the AFC North by beating the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, plain and simple. This matchup could lose some of its impact before kickoff because the Steelers can also clinch the division title if the Packers do former quarterback Aaron Rodgers a solid by beating the Ravens on Saturday night.Browns All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett can also clinch the NFL's all-time, single-season sacks record with his 23rd sack of 2025 against Rodgers on Sunday afternoon. Seahawks (12-3) at Panthers (8-7)The Carolina Panthers can clinch the NFC South title with a win over the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks, and a Tampa Bay Buccaneers loss against the Miami Dolphins. Carolina did already beat the then-No. 1 seed Los Angeles Rams earlier this season. The Seahawks' path to the NFC West crown and the conference's No. 1 overall seed is simple: win out against the Panthers and then against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 18. Plenty on the line in this Sam Darnold revenge game. \nJaguars (11-4) at Colts (8-7)The Jacksonville Jaguars have a somewhat plausible path to being the AFC's No. 1 seed: winning out against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 17 and the Tennessee Titans in Week 18 and both the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots losing just one of their remaining two games. Jacksonville can lock up the AFC South this week with a win and a Texans loss against the Chargers on Saturday night. The Colts, who have a 1.8% chance of making the playoffs per CBS' SportsLine model, need to win out against the Jaguars and Houston Texans and have the Texans lose against the Chargers in Week 17. Giants (2-13) at Raiders (2-13)The New York Giants and the Las Vegas Raiders currently possess the first and second overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft, respectively. CBS' SportsLine model gives the Giants a 32.6% chance at securing the top pick and the Raiders a 27.6% shot at the first overall pick. \nThis matchup will also be historic: it's the first game in NFL history between teams both entering a matchup on nine-game losing streaks. The Tank Bowl is here, and it is glorious. Patriots (12-3) at Jets (3-12)The New England Patriots can win the AFC East in Week 17 with a victory over the New York Jets and a Buffalo Bills loss against the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. Both outcomes are quite plausible. The No. 1 seed in the AFC is also well within reach for the Patriots should they win out against the Jets and Miami Dolphins and the Denver Broncos lose against either the Chiefs in Week 17 or the Chargers in Week 18. Meanwhile, the Jets are in possession of the 2026 NFL Draft's fourth overall pick with a chance to climb higher up the board with two more losses to finish out the season. The top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft is still within reach. \nEagles (10-5) at Bills (11-4)The Philadelphia Eagles are fighting for playoff seeding only, having already won the NFC East, but the highest they can climb is likely the No. 2 seed. The Buffalo Bills need to win out and have the Patriots lose one more game in order to win the AFC East for a sixth year in a row. A battle between two preseason Super Bowl favorites will be quite the treat.Bears (11-4) at 49ers (11-4)Both the Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers have the top seed in the NFC in their sights. The Bears have an 11% chance, according to CBS' SportsLine model, to pull it off with a win at the 49ers on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 17  before closing out the regular season at home against the Detroit Lions with another victory along with the Seattle Seahawks losing a game. The 49ers possess a 25% chance, according to CBS' SportsLine model, to finish atop the NFC with a Week 17 win against the Bears before concluding the regular season with a win against the Seattle Seahawks. If the 49ers can grab the No. 1 seed, they won't have to leave Levi's Stadium again starting in Week 17 since the site of Super Bowl LX is their home in Santa Clara. No game is more impactful in Week 17 than \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas — Players all around the NFL found out they made the Pro Bowl for the 2025 season on Tuesday, and the Dallas Cowboys ended up with five amid a 6-8-1, postseason-less year.Quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver George Pickens, left guard Tyler Smith, defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and kicker Brandon Aubrey were the five to earn the individual All-Star accolades for the Cowboys. Given how the year has gone on the field, Prescott wasn't in a celebratory mood when discussing the honor despite producing like a top-five quarterback a year removed from a season-ending hamstring injury in 2024.\"It's cool. It's something good within the season. Understanding every year I work my tail off to try to be the best quarterback I can for this team. Ultimately, I feel like I'm judged off of wins. I didn't get it done this season. However, the individual numbers, performance record, allowed an individual accolade, but that's 100% still a team deal,\" Prescott said Tuesday. \"When you're the quarterback of this team, to be able to put up numbers like that, you've got to have receivers like George, CeeDee, Ferg, the rest of the guys. And you've got to have a great offensive line. ... My success, that accolade, is 100% with each and every one of those guys in there. It's pretty cool to be a Pro Bowler, but at the end of the day, it's not what we're going for.\"\nDak PrescottNFL rankCompletion percentage 68.5%5thPassing yards4,1752ndPassing TD283rdExpected points added (EPA)/dropback0.177thPassing first downs2022ndDallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones took accountability for the Cowboys' 30-year Super Bowl drought after the team's Week 16 defeat against the Chargers on Sunday. A year like 2025 has everyone from top to bottom in Dallas looking in the mirror.\"I'll admit that the Cowboys management has played a big role (in the 30-year Super Bowl drought),\" Jones said postgame. \"But seriously, I'm very disappointed that the way we're structured, and my role, puts us here tonight. I'm tremendously disappointed.\"The 2025 season marks just the third of Prescott's 10-year career in which he will have played at least 12 games and missed the playoffs, along with 2017 and 2019. He'll be 33 years old at the start of the 2026 season, and he knows he's on the back nine of his NFL career. That's why Prescott plans to seek more input with Jones and the Cowboys' front office when it comes to communicating exactly what he feels the team needs to thrive going forward.\"We won't be back here in this spot. I feel like the last few times I've probably said that were playoff losses, right? So each year has its own troubles. ... I'm going to do my damnedest just controlling what I can, and you know as you get older, having more input, having more say-so and being asked more questions from the front office, maybe there's a little bit more that I can do. It's not just physically or me getting better at my game. Maybe it's speaking up and saying that, 'This will help, or I think this can help.' So, whatever it takes, I'm going to do my damnedest and make sure that I'm influencing and encouraging everybody else around me -- not just players -- to do the same.\"  Here's a look at three moves Prescott could influence once Dallas enters the offseason in two weeks.Re-signing WR George Pickens\nNew Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens broke out in his first year in Dallas at age 24, playing like a top-five player at his position while catching passes from Prescott. The Dallas duo has connected for 13 plays of 25 or more yards this season, tied for the third most in the NFL, and now they'll head to the Pro Bowl together.\"Super explosive,\" Pickens said of the connection he built in Year 1 with Prescott. \"I feel like that's one of the biggest things when you look back on the year, even though it's not over. Just look at the explosive plays that me, him, CeeDee [Lamb], Flo [Ryan Flournoy], everybody produced on offense. Javonte [Williams], too.\"Pickens' career year came at the perfect time, with the 2022 second-round pick set to become a free agent next offseason upon the expiration of his rookie deal.\"It improves my career, but as far as contractually, I can just wait until the offseason,\" Pickens said of making the Pro Bowl. \"Trying to finish up this season on a positive note.\" George PickensNFL rankCatches888thReceiving Yards1,3423rdReceiving TD97thReceiving First Downs693rdCatches of 25 yards or more  13T-3rdPickens would like to remain in Dallas, so Prescott will certainly look to make sure Jones knows he wants his co-No. 1 receiver back with the Cowboys for the foreseeable future. The success Pickens experienced in 2025 has enticed him to want to make Dallas his long-term home.\"Definitely, like I always said, the guys here, I feel like you can't get that everywhere,\" Pickens said. \"I kind of have been at other places -- top 30 visits when I was coming out in the pre-draft -- the guys here and the culture here are just a little different.\"Re-signing RB Javonte Williams\nDallas made 25-year-old running back Javonte Williams its first free agent signing in 2025, inking him to a one-year, $3 million deal in March. They got him at that price because he hadn't quite looked the same since a gruesome knee injury that resulted in multiple torn ligaments in 2022 with the Broncos. However, he fully bounced back from the effects of that injury to produce like a top-10 running back. Williams is certainly someone everyone involved with Dallas' offense would like to have around again in 2026.\"He certainly earned the right to be the bell cow here,\" coach Brian Schottenheimer said Wednesday. \"We like him in that role.\"Williams said last week that he's found a \"very special\" fit in Dallas. That's a fit Prescott would certainly like to remain going forward, given Williams is one of three players -- along with Tony Dorsett (1977) and Ezekiel Elliott (2016) -- to produce 1,000 yards and 10 rushing touchdowns in their first season with the Cowboys.\"You don't always want to just follow money and things like that,\" Williams said. \"You want to go somewhere where you can succeed and be a part of something that's special. I feel like it's very special here.\"Javonte WilliamsNFL rankCarries2397thRush yards1,1476thRush TD10T-7thRush first downs63T-4thKeeping Tyler Smith at left guard\nWith 2024 first-round left tackle Tyler Guyton sidelined with an ankle injury since Week 13, Dallas has had All-Pro left guard Tyler Smith protecting Prescott's blind side for the team's final three games of 2025. It's an arrangement the Cowboys are experimenting with to see if they may want to keep Smith in that role in the future, even though they made him the NFL's highest-paid interior offensive lineman this offseason with a four-year, $96 million contract extension.Guyton did play right tackle at Oklahoma, and current Cowboys right tackle Terence Steele leads the NFL in quarterback pressures allowed (42) this season, according to TruMedia. Dallas could save as much as $14 million if it designates Steele as a post-June 1 release. It is also worth noting Smith was a college left tackle at Tulsa.\n\"If you watch the way [Smith] played and how these guys functioned, we know he can play out there. We're not surprised. I'm not surprised,\" Schottenheimer said Monday. \"At the end of the day, we made the move because we thought it gave us the best chance to win the next three games. That's the way it's going to be for these next two games now. We'll evaluate everything. It's no different from scheme. We'll evaluate everything.\"Smith earned the third Pro Bowl selection of his four-year career in 2025, as he was Pro Football Focus' sixth-highest-graded run-blocking guard with a 79.8 grade. He's all for being a team player, but he'd appreciate continuing to play the position that made him a second-team All-Pro in 2023 and a Pro Bowler again in 2025.\"Bro, I'm an All-Pro guard, bro. You feel me? That's the simple truth that we're just looking at stuff, purely off facts,\" Smith said Tuesday. \"So we'll see what happens. We'll have those conversations. Got to see where everybody's head is at.\"  At 6-foot-6 and 332 pounds with 34-inch arms, Smith feels his best position is guard. That's something Prescott may need to help Smith relay to Schottenheimer and Jones this offseason.\n\"I'm a strong guy obviously. I think I'm strong. I feel like a lot of the strengths that I have as a player are very good for me at the guard position,\" Smith said. \"I think I've had great vets around at the guard [Zack Martin] and tackle position [Tyron Smith], and I think that's really helped me be successful at both. But I really just think my strength and a variety of other things help me when I'm inside.\"\n            ",

Metcalf appealed his suspension, but his appeal was denied Tuesday night by an officer assigned to represent both the NFL and NFLPA. Metcalf's suspension triggers what could be up to $40 million in voided contract guarantees, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports.While Metcalf's suspension was upheld, the league will be in touch with the Lions regarding the fan code of conduct based on the information from Metcalf in his hearing. Pittsburgh's veteran receiver is slated to miss the Steelers' Week 17 road game against the Cleveland Browns and their Week 18 home game with the Baltimore Ravens. Pittsburgh (9-6) can clinch the AFC North division title with either a win over the Browns or a Ravens loss at Green Bay on Saturday night. \nMetcalf, who signed a four-year, $132 million deal with Pittsburgh this past offseason, is slated to lose $555,556 in salary over the next two weeks. \"I certainly don't condone the behavior, but I support DK Metcalf,\" coach Mike Tomlin said of Metcalf during his weekly press conference. \"He's been great. He cares, he works hard. He's a heck of a guy. He's a good teammate, and and that's why he's easy to support.\" The NFL determined that Metcalf's actions violated league policy, which specifies that \"players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.\"\nMetcalf appeared to throw a punch at a Lions fan during the first half of Pittsburgh's eventual 29-24 win. Metcalf reportedly had prior history with the fan when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. \nOn Tuesday morning, another video of the encounter surfaced that included the fan sharing that getting Metcalf to react to him \"was the goal.\" \nBecause this interaction took place off the field and was not seen by officials, it could not be penalized or result in an ejection, according to CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore. \n\"Because the officials did not see this -- and (you) wouldn't expect them to from where DK Metcalf was, it's not something they can weigh in on from an officiating standpoint. I have been notified, though, that will be delivered to compliance with the NFL, and they'll address it at that point,\" Steratore said. The fan, who identified himself as Ryan Kennedy, told The Detroit Free Press that the altercation stemmed from him calling Metcalf by his full name. A source close to Metcalf, however, told NFL Media that Kennedy called Metcalf's mom a derogatory word and also called Metcalf \"something we both know you don't call a Black man.\"Metcalf, who played the entire game, caught four passes for 42 yards and delivered a key block on Jaylen Warren's second 45-yard touchdown run that proved to be the game-winning score. \nHow does this impact the Steelers?\nMetcalf's suspension won't matter if the Packers defeat the Ravens on Saturday night. If that happens, it would make Pittsburgh's final two regular-season games meaningless from a playoff standpoint.If the Ravens beat the Packers, however, Metcalf's absence could become a significant factor for a Steelers team that would then need to win one of their remaining two games in order to capture the North and the playoff berth that comes with it. In addition to being the Steelers' leading receiver (in terms of receiving yards), Metcalf is also a physical presence in the running game, as evidenced on Warren's game-winning touchdown run against the Lions. Metcalf's physicality was one of the things that compelled the Steelers to acquire him this offseason. \nIf the Steelers need to win one of their remaining two games, Metcalf's absence will undoubtedly put more pressure on Pittsburgh's other skill players. Fortunately for the Steelers, they've received a recent uptick in production from their pass-catchers after acquiring veteran Adam Thielen and signing Marquez Valdes-Scantling off the practice squad. Tomlin specifically mentioned Roman Wilson has someone whom he hopes steps up amid Metcalf's absence. A 2024 third-round pick, Wilson has 12 catches and two touchdowns this season, but his role has diminished with the recent additions of Thielen and Valdes-Scantling. \"I'm excited what this opportunity might mean for him to display growth in the midst of the time where he hadn't been participating,\" Tomlin said of Wilson. \"To show his professionalism and his readiness and how he's been sharpening his sword for battle in the ranks while he hadn't been playing.\"\nThe Steelers have also continued to receive sizable contributions in the passing game from Warren and fellow running back Kenneth Gainwell. The duo has combined to catch 95 passes for 710 yards and five touchdowns that include Gainwell's unbelievable 45-yard touchdown catch during Sunday's win over the Lions. Gainwell is actually the Steelers' leading pass-catcher with 62 catches through 15 games. Pittsburgh is also coming off of its best rushing performance of the season, which included 230 yards on 27 carries. Warren, who had two touchdown runs of 45 yards, is averaging 4.5 yards per carry and is 172 yards away from his first 1,000-yard rushing season. Gainwell has complemented Warren with 501 yards on the ground and a team-high 4.9 yards per carry. Metcalf's suspension will only impact the Steelers if the Ravens win on Saturday night. But even if that happens, it appears Pittsburgh has several players capable of stepping into the void.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's Christmas week in the NFL, and several teams around the league hope Santa delivers them a playoff berth. Heading into Week 16, only two playoff spots had been clinched in the NFL, but that number has now shot up to 10, which means there are still four spots up for grabs as the season heads into Week 17. On top of that, there's also a wide-open race to clinch the No. 1 overall seed in both the NFC and AFC. With just two weeks left to play, there are still SIX teams that could earn the top seed in the AFC and four teams that are still mathematically alive to earn the No. 1 seed in the NFC. With just 32 games left on the regular-season schedule, it should be a wild finish, with several teams soon hoping to celebrate a Merry Clinchmas. So what's the playoff field going to look like? Glad you asked. We had Stephen Oh of SportsLine simulate the rest of the season so we could figure out who's going to make the playoffs. Not only did Oh project all 14 teams that will make the playoffs, but he also projected the seed each team will end up getting. \nRemember, this is just a projection. If you want to see the actual playoff picture, we've got that here. If your favorite team has already been eliminated from postseason contention, then you might be more interested in reading a mock draft, and if that's the case, we have one of those for you right here.  Alright, let's get to the projections. z-clinched division titlex-clinched playoff berthAFC playoff projectionProjections via SportsLine\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. x-Denver Broncos (AFC West champion)Remaining schedule: at Chiefs, ChargersThere are SIX teams still alive for the top seed in the AFC, and the computer thinks Denver will eventually clinch it. The Broncos (12-3) have a 47.5% chance of landing the No. 1 overall seed, which puts them well ahead of the Patriots, who are the next best team at 27.2%. One thing working in Denver's favor is that the Broncos will be getting an easier than expected Week 17 game against the Chiefs. With both Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew out, the Chiefs will be down to their third-string QB for their Christmas game against Denver. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. x-New England Patriots (AFC East champion)Remaining schedule: at Jets, DolphinsThe Patriots (12-3) can clinch the AFC East as early this week with a win over the Jets combined with a Bills loss to Philadelphia. Even if that doesn't happen, the computer is still pretty convinced that New England will end up winning the division. The Patriots have a 71.1% chance of taking home the division title, compared to just 28.9% for Buffalo.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. x-Jacksonville Jaguars (AFC South champion)Remaining schedule: at Colts, TitansThe Jaguars (11-4) pulled off a huge win over the Broncos in Week 16, and that has opened the door for them to possibly steal the top seed. For that to happen, Jacksonville would have to win out and then the Patriots and Broncos would both have to lose one of their final two games. It's a long shot scenario, which is why the Jags have just a 9.5% chance of getting the top seed. Even if they don't get the No. 1 seed, they can still clinch the AFC South title as soon as this week with a win over the Colts combined with a Houston loss to the Chargers. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (AFC North champion)Remaining schedule: at Browns, RavensThe Steelers (9-6) are now in the driver's seat to win the AFC North after pulling off an upset over the Lions on Sunday. The Steelers could win the division before they even take the field this week if Baltimore loses to Green Bay on Saturday night. If the Ravens win, then the Steelers can clinch the division by beating the Browns on Sunday. Of course, if the Ravens win and the Steelers lose, that will set up a Week 18 showdown between Baltimore and Pittsburgh for the AFC North title.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. x-Buffalo Bills (wild card 1)Remaining schedule: Eagles, JetsThe Bills (11-4) can still win the AFC East title if they win out and the Patriots lose at least one of their final two games. However, the computer doesn't see that happening, which is why the Bills are locked into the first wild card spot. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. x-Los Angeles Chargers (wild card 2)Remaining schedule: Texans, at DenverThe Chargers (11-4) have a very simple path to winning the AFC West: If they win their final two games, they'll take home the division title. Unfortunately for the Chargers, the computer doesn't think they're going to go 2-0. The good news for the Chargers is that they've already clinched a playoff berth, so even if they lose their final two games, they'll still be a part of the postseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (wild card 3)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, ColtsThe Texans (10-5) can officially clinch a playoff berth on Saturday if they can beat the Chargers. Not only that, but Houston is actually still alive to win the AFC South and clinch the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC. The Texans will take the division title if they win out and the Jaguars lose at least one game. To clinch the top seed, the Texans would need a lot of help, which is why they have just a 0.1% chance of that happening.Other playoff chances: Ravens (6.8%), Colts (1.8%)Teams eliminated: Chiefs, Bengals, Dolphins, Browns, Jets, Raiders, TitansAFC wild card round projection(7) Texans at (2) Patriots (6) Chargers at (3) Jaguars (5) Bills at (4) Steelers Bye: Broncos\nNFC playoff projectionProjections via SportsLine\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. x-Seattle Seahawks (NFC West champion)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at 49ers The race for the No. 1 seed is going to go down the wire, and right now, the computer views the Seahawks (12-3) as the heavy favorite. Seattle has a 44.7% chance of getting the top seed, which is well ahead of the next closest team (the 49ers are at 25.1%). If the Seahawks win their final two games, they'll take home the top seed and the NFC West crown.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. x-Chicago Bears (NFC North champion)Remaining schedule: at 49ers, LionsThe surging Bears (11-4) can clinch the NFC North title by winning one of their final two games. They can also get the top seed in the NFC if they go 2-0 down the stretch and Seattle loses at least one of its final two games.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. z-Philadelphia Eagles (NFC East champion)Remaining schedule: at Bills, CommandersWith the 49ers' win on Monday night, the Eagles (10-5) were officially eliminated from earning the No. 1 seed. That means Philadelphia is almost certainly going to end up with the second or third seed, and right now, the computer has them heading into the postseason at No. 3 overall. (The Eagles could also get the fourth seed, but that won't be possible after Sunday if they beat the Bills OR if the Panthers lose to the Seahawks.)\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Carolina Panthers (NFC South champion) Remaining schedule: Seahawks, at Buccaneers The computer basically views the NFC South race as a coin toss: The Panthers (8-7) have a 53.5% chance of winning compared to the Buccaneers, who are at 46.5%. The Panthers can clinch the division title this week with a win over Seattle plus a Bucs' loss to the Dolphins. However, if the Panthers lose to the Seahawks, then the division title will be on the line in Week 18 in Tampa Bay. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. x-Los Angeles Rams (wild card 1)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, Cardinals The Rams (11-4) lost a heartbreaker on Thursday against the Seahawks, which is likely going to cost them a shot at the No. 1 overall seed. The Rams can still get the top seed, but they would have to win out and also have the Bears, 49ers and Seahawks all lose one of their final two games. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. x-San Francisco 49ers (wild card 2)Remaining schedule: Bears, SeahawksThe 49ers (11-4) will be an interesting team to watch over the next two weeks because they control their own path when it comes to winning the NFC West and clinching the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. If the 49ers win their final two games, they'll go into the playoffs as the NFC's top seed. Unfortunately for San Francisco, the computer doesn't see that happening. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (wild card 3)Remaining schedule: Ravens, at Vikings The Packers (9-5-1) can officially clinch a playoff berth on Saturday if they beat the Ravens. The Packers also have an outside shot at the division title, but they would need to win their final two games and the Bears would have to lose their final two games. The Packers could actually clinch a playoff spot before they even take the field on Saturday if the Lions lose to the Vikings on Christmas. Other playoff chances: Buccaneers (46.5%), Lions (5.1%)Teams eliminated: Cowboys, Falcons, Vikings, Commanders, Cardinals, Saints, GiantsNFC wild card round projection(7) Packers at (2) Bears (6) 49ers at (3) Eagles (5) Rams at (4) Panthers Bye: Seahawks\n            ",

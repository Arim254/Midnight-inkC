Three of the teams that Houston defeated during its win streak are current AFC playoff squads in Jacksonville, Buffalo and Indianapolis. Meanwhile, the single best unit on the field come Sunday, and arguably in all of the NFL, is Houston's defense. It has allowed both the fewest points and fewest yards, and the Texans are the only NFL team which hasn't allowed more touchdown passes than it has defensive interceptions. Just five teams have more sacks than Houston (34), and it gets to face a Chiefs squad that's allowed three-plus sacks in five straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Chiefs can coverOne can't ignore Kansas City's five straight wins over Houston, with the four of those at home all coming by at least eight points. This year's Chiefs have balance, as one of six teams to rank in the top 10 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, while Houston has the No. 21 scoring offense. Kansas City is also extremely efficient, as it's committed the second-fewest turnovers, and Patrick Mahomes is having one of his finest seasons. He ranks second in the league in QBR, third in passing yards and fifth in passing touchdowns. Mahomes has also carved up the Texans like no other over his career as across six games versus Houston, the two-time MVP owns a 15:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. See which team to back at SportsLine.Missouri sports betting is now live.

The lofty achievement all but guarantees Dvalishvili as the 2025 Fighter of the Year and the greatest bantamweight of all time. Before that, he must prove that his first win over former champion Yan wasn't an aberration. Yan is rejuvenated with three consecutive wins under his belt and confidence that he's more physically fit for the rematch.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage of UFC 323, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!A second title fight supports UFC 323. Alexandre Pantoja is building a strong case for being the second-best flyweight champion in UFC history, behind only Mount Rushmore fighter Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. His next challenger is compelling. Joshua Van burst onto the scene, going from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years.

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- Payton Talbott and Henry Cejudo are the real deal. Talbott improved remarkably from his loss to Raoni Barcelos in January, taking down the Olympic gold medal wrestler twice at UFC 323 on Saturday in Las Vegas. Cejudo, outgunned and outsized, never relented in his final MMA fight, but still came up short on the scorecards to the young Talbott.Saturday's main card fighters delivered a thrilling scrap that won't soon be forgotten. Cejudo, bloodied and battered, fought through a crimson mask, refusing to retire quietly. Round 2 was particularly memorable, with Cejudo surviving an offensive onslaught by throwing back with a pitbull-like viciousness. \nThe size disparity between Talbott and Cejudo was apparent. Talbott, 11 years his opponent's junior, towered over the former two-division champion. He leveraged that reach and power to hurt Cejudo every round. Talbott pointed to the center, Max Holloway style, several times in Round 3. Cejudo accepted the invitation each time. \nTalbott's wrestling was arguably more impressive than his flashy striking. In January, Barcelos handed Talbott his first loss after eight takedowns. Fast forward to December, and Talbott not only fended off Cejudo's takedowns, but he also took down the Olympian twice. Cejudo retires for a second time after his previous retirement in 2023. The second leg of his career was fruitless, as Cejudo went 0-4. However, his legacy was solidified well before Saturday. Cejudo became a two-division UFC champion by beating a legend in Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson, and bantamweight greats T.J. Dillashaw and Dominick Cruz. In his final appearance, Cejudo refused to go down without a fight. \nThis victory is far and away the biggest of Talbott's career. Next week, he'll likely be ranked in the UFC's official bantamweight Top 10, usurping Cejudo's spot. Furthermore, he thoroughly beat a surefire Hall of Famer on a pay-per-view main card. The future looks bright for one of the promotion's most marketable young prospects.\n            ",

Van succeeded in dethroning Alexandre Pantoja to become the second youngest UFC champion ever, but the outcome of their fight at UFC 323 does little to address who the better man was. Early in Round 1, Pantoja threw a high kick. Van caught the kick and threw Pantoja to the mat. The defending champion immediately clutched his arm and called for referee Herb Dean. The official quickly stepped in and waved off the fight. A gruesome replay showed Pantoja's arm snapping at the elbow as he tried to plant on the mat. Van quickly consoled Pantoja as top contender Tatsuro Taira expressed shock cageside. Van raised his arms in victory as UFC announcer Bruce Buffer named him the new flyweight champion, and his coach paraded Van around on his shoulder. Such showboating might sour fans who deem the outcome inconclusive. Calling the injury a freak accident unfairly discredits Van. It was his offensive action that led to the finish. However, the armbreak was an unlikely outcome and a secondary effect of Van's attack, not something he intended to do. \nVan's name will go down in the record books regardless of the method of victory. At 24 years old, he became the second-youngest UFC champion in history, behind only Jon Jones, arguably MMA's all-time best fighter. Van's progress is remarkable. He didn't start competing professionally until after the COVID-19 pandemic and has already reached the mountaintop of the sport.Pantoja, 35, was building a great case for himself as the second-best flyweight of all-time, behind only Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. This loss does little to damage that. \nWhat's next depends on how fast Pantoja can heal. If his recovery timeline is short, the UFC might want to book an immediate rematch. Otherwise, Taira established himself as a worthy challenger after beating former two-time champion Brandon Moreno on Saturday. Van and Taira took virtually no damage at UFC 323 so, pending approval from the Nevada State Athletic Commission, they could turn around quickly. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday was almost more notable for what didn't happen than the chaos on the pitch. Benched for the third consecutive match, club legend Mohamed Salah went as an unused sub for the second time in the last three matches. Salah has now failed to register a goal contribution in seven consecutive matches in all competitions, and he only has five goals and three assists all season, while Liverpool have slipped, not just out of the title race, but out of the European places altogether.It's been a trying season for the Reds, and following the draw, Salah has opened the door to whether this could be the end of his time at Liverpool. While Salah has been a critical part of Liverpool's attack, scoring 29 goals and assisting 18 more en route to winning the title last season, being on the bench these past few games is getting to him, and the Egyptian sounded off following the loss to Leeds.\"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,\" Salah said. While Salah didn't specify who is trying to get him out of the club, he did admit that his relationship with manager Arne Slot has deteriorated this season. \n\"I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship,\" Salah said. \"I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.\"Salah leaves for the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Egypt on Dec. 15, and if they advance to the final, he wouldn't return to Liverpool until after Jan. 18 of 2026, when the winter transfer window will be open. Despite just signing a contract extension with Liverpool at the end of last season, this could be the end of Salah at Anfield. He still has two games before AFCON, an away trip to Inter in the Champions League on Tuesday, followed by a home clash with Brighton on Dec. 13Comments like the ones made Saturday are tough ones to come back from, and they didn't end there for Salah. \n\"I said to [my family], come to the Brighton game. I don't know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it. In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now,\" Salah said. \"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup. I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.\"With previous interest from the Saudi Pro League, if Liverpool were to decide that it's time to move on, they could likely find a suitor to take the Egyptian. Even at 33, Salah has more to give, but Father Time is catching up to him in the Premier League, so a January move could benefit all parties.\"In football, you never know. I don't accept this situation. I have done so much for this club,\" Salah said when asked if this would be his last game for the club.\nIt seems like Salah is willing to fight for his place at Liverpool, but it has created quite a situation for Slot and the club. Playing Salah after this almost makes it seem like Slot is caving to him, but then not selecting Salah would deepen the spiral that is happening. When Slot took over for Jurgen Klopp ahead of last season, he was expected to face adversity, but with the Reds riding a smooth journey to the title, he avoided the worst of it.That all seems to be coming to a head this season, as with Liverpool not winning, cracks in the foundation of the club are there as they struggle to integrate Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak. Previously, this was Salah's team, and with the additions and decisions made, it has morphed into Slot's team. That'd be one thing if Liverpool were keeping pace with the title contenders, but if it comes down to Salah versus Slot in a power struggle, it's unclear what direction the front office would lean. Liverpool have rarely been a team to dismiss a manager in the middle of a season, especially when someone has built up as much goodwill as Slot did in his first year in charge, but something also will need to give here between the duo if the situation is fixed. If it doesn't get fixed, Liverpool's issues from this season will grow and they could find themselves looking at quite a long rebuild down the road.\n            ",

The second season of the 12-team College Football Playoff format was just as chaotic as the first, but now things are coming down to the wire as the CFP Selection Committee makes its final deliberations ahead of the official bracket being unveiled Sunday afternoon. Entering championship week of the 2025 season, the Big Ten boasted the FBS' last two undefeated teams in Ohio State and Indiana. Obviously, that changed in the Big Ten Championship Game as Indiana staked its claim for the playoff's top seed with a win. Elsewhere, bubble teams like No. 9 Alabama and No. 11 BYU left their playoff fates in the hands of the selection committee following lopsided losses in their respective league title games. This year's iteration of the 12-team College Football Playoff format will look a little different as it brings a transition to the straight-seeding model, which means that the top-four seeds -- regardless of if they won a conference championship or not -- will earn a first-round bye. Teams ranked 5-8 will still host a game in the first round. Read more: Brad Crawford's bowl projections | CFP Rankings prediction | Experts pick CFP teams 1-12\nWe'll find out the College Football Playoff field during the CFP Selection Show, airing at noon ET on ESPN and streaming live on fuboTV (Try for free).

    "body": "\n        Best player, best résumé.That's what No. 4 Duke claims ownership of after its latest high-profile victory, a 66-60 win Saturday at No. 7 Michigan State.The Blue Devils may also be the best team ... but we've got a long way to go and a lot of competition at the top of the sport to determine that. As things stand now, Jon Scheyer's 10-0 Blue Devils are most certainly among the three or four best college basketball has to offer, particularly after Purdue's debatable grasp on No. 1 disappeared with its baffling home rout at the hands of No. 10 Iowa State. No. 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherever you want to slot Duke in terms of team prowess, I don't think there's an argument against Duke's case to have the best body of work through the first five weeks of the season. Arizona had that claim in mid-November (I wrote about it here) after winning at shorthanded UConn, and then Michigan held a rightful entitlement to it following its historic three-game romp through the Players Era Championship. (I covered that, too.) Now it's Duke's turn.If I were to build an NCAA Tournament bracket coming out of this weekend, the Blue Devils would be my No. 1 overall seed. (After Friday's CBS Sports Bracketology had the Blue Devils at No. 2 overall behind Michigan.)\nHalf of the Blue Devils' wins have come against power-conference competition. No other school can match that. Duke is 4-0 in Quad 1 games. No other team has a record that good; Michigan is the only 3-0 team in Quad 1 results. Here's a surprise: Saturday marked Duke's first win over a top-10 opponent on the road since February 2019, when Zion Williamson and Co. beat Virginia. (Hey, I was at that one.) Here are the five big Ws, four of which came against ranked competition. Numbers in parentheses are where the teams currently rank at KenPom.com:75-60 over Texas (55) in Charlotte on the opening night of the season78-66 over Kansas (18) in the Champions Classic at Madison Square Garden80-71 over Arkansas (30) in the Thanksgiving Classic at the United Center67-66 over Florida (12) on Tuesday at Cameron Indoor66-60 over Michigan State at Breslin Center on SaturdayNotice how four of Duke's five best wins have come away from home, and with the four most recent wins also transpiring against coaches with national championships to their name: Self, Calipari, Golden, Izzo. And the margin of victory in those five games? A fluffy 8.6 points.\nDuke also just won three consecutive games against ranked teams in the regular season for just the second time in program history. (February of 2016 being the other.)At BartTorvik.com, Duke has leapfrogged Michigan in Wins Above Bubble, a résumé metric that doesn't factor in predictive data and now also has a proxy that the selection committee uses. (Iowa State is now third in résumé strength following its historic takedown of Purdue.)What does it all mean? More than you might think. Duke will inevitably take losses this season, yes, but the fact it's gotten to 10-0 and still hasn't played a well-rounded game is an unnerving thought for the rest of the sport. Go look at the past five weeks worth of results around college hoops. We've seen Michigan at the near-peak of its powers, and I'd say the same case could be made for Gonzaga, Iowa State, Arizona, even Michigan State. But Duke (and I think UConn fits in this as well) is yet to put it all together. \nI'm not sure the team even really knows how to full-on win yet as much as it's adapted to learning how not to lose. After all, six of its top seven minutes-getters are freshmen and sophomores. And it's still this good right away? Hooooo, boy.It would have been entirely understandable for NPOY frontrunner Cameron Boozer and his teammates to simply come up short in the toughest environment they've seen this season. They trailed at the half, Breslin was boppin' and Michigan State looked well on the scent. Didn't happen. To date, it has yet to happen to this team that, despite its super-strong start and influential brand name, wasn't even ranked in the top five in the preseason. \nScheyer has been able to lose five NBA Draft picks and somehow pick up where Duke left off a season ago, when Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Blue Devils made the Final Four as a 35-4 team and ranked No. 1 at year's end at KenPom. If you think just bringing in elite prospects and/or prime transfer portal targets and paying them huge money equates to large-scale winning because you're at a blue blood, go ask Mark Pope how that's working out this season. Duke's proving it can win in a variety of ways, too. On Saturday, it needed to find its ugliest victory yet. Having Boozer on the team solves a lot of problems, but he can't do it alone. In fact, Boozer had the worst half of his young career vs. Sparty when he managed just two points. He picked up a third foul — a completely avoidable third foul, at that — early in the second half. At that point, it seemed like Michigan State was going to keep its undefeated season going. Then Boozer went beast mode again: 16 points and eight rebounds in the second half, finishing with 18 points, 15 boards, five assists and fouling out late in the second half. That fifth assist was the most crucial. When Duke needed a play to secure the win, the option was for Boozer to make it happened. Then he found himself mauled and double-teamed, so he passed to a wide-open Caleb Foster, whose 3 rolled in and clinched the game.\nMSU ran out of options down the stretch. For as brilliant of a distributor as Jeremy Fears Jr. has been this season (he leads the country in assists, now averaging more than 10 per game), he didn't make a field goal on Saturday (0-of-10). Tom Izzo is now a hapless 3-15 all time vs. the Blue Devils, and 1-10 in his last 11 games against top-five opponents. It's the one big bugaboo of his Hall of Fame career.And even with Michigan State playing its style of choice against such a huge team — slow-tempo ball, keeping the game in the 60s — Duke was comfortable in the fight for all 40 minutes. That's in part because, even though Michigan State was holding opponents to 60.4 points heading into Saturday, Duke was a tick better at 59.6. It was a second straight win with a battle into the final minute; Duke held off Florida at home on Tuesday with a big 3-pointer from Isiah Evans with 19.7 seconds remaining. Now Duke is 10-0 for the first time since starting 11-0 in 2017-18. And while Duke probably won't leap to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 — I'd expect Arizona or Michigan to take the top spot — it's going to have the strongest dossier for two weeks, minimum. The next game of note comes at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 22, a meetup with Texas Tech. \nBest team? We'll see. But no other squad has proven more against better competition literally from Game 1 until now than Duke. It's starting to make me wonder if, somehow, this team can actually match the historic dominance of last year's group. That team had games lost on last-second shots and botched plays. That's not happening here, which doubles as the best news for Duke. It's not only off to a terrific start, these Devils looks like they might have the one thing last year's elite team lacked: a closer's mentality.\n            ",

That result dropped the Cougars, who were on the playoff bubble entering this weekend's title game slate, to a respectable 11-2 on the year. Both of those defeats came against the Red Raiders. BYU failed to look competitive in either result, as the Cougars were outscored 63-14 in their two games against Texas Tech. With plenty of firsthand experience to draw upon, BYU coach Kalani Sitake referred to Texas Tech as the \"best team in the country\" multiple times while addressing reporters after his team got dressed down. Sitake wasn't entirely optimistic about the Cougars' CFP chances moving forward, but he still called for a fair selection process from the committee. \"They're (Texas Tech) the No. 1 team in the country,\" Sitake said. \"I don't know what the other rankings are. This team is really good. So you go play the No. 1 team in the country twice, one in Lubbock and then one at a neutral site which is the same state (Texas). I thought our fans showed up and made a lot of noise. I would love another crack at it... I like who we are and I like what we've been able to do. I think we have a great résumé. But I've got to watch the other games too.\n\"I just know that when they're doing comparisons, hopefully they put it out there and make it fair. At least put us in the graphic. That would be nice.\"        Sitake's last sentence was a not-so-veiled shot at coverage of the College Football Playoff. A graphic was shown comparing teams nine through 12 in the latest CFP Rankings reveal show. No. 11 BYU was excluded, as all the focus went to No. 9 Alabama, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 12 Miami. At least Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire is on BYU's side after his squad likely secured a top-four seed and first-round bye. \n\"Whenever the selection committee starts looking at teams, I truly the Big 12 deserves two teams in the playoffs,\" McGuire said. \"Whenever you look at BYU, they're 11-2 and their two losses are to the No. 4 team in the nation. I have so much respect for Kalani. That's a really good football team and I hope the committee looks at it. Cause there's gonna be two loss teams out there, but there's not going to be an 11-2 loss team. They did a great job throughout the season getting here.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The final two UFC title defenses of 2025 are set to go down on Saturday at UFC 323 in Las Vegas. In the main event, bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili will look to pick up his fourth win of the year when he faces former champion Petr Yan in a rematch.If Dvalishvili can defeat Yan, he would set the record for the most consecutive bantamweight title defenses at four and become the first champion to defend a title four times in a calendar year. Yan is a dangerous opponent, with sharp boxing and strong takedown defense, but sits as a +330 underdog.A second title fight supports UFC 323. Alexandre Pantoja is building a strong case for being the second-best flyweight champion in UFC history, behind only Mount Rushmore fighter Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. His next challenger is compelling. Joshua Van burst onto the scene, going from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years. Like Dvalishvili, he fights for the fourth time this year in pursuit of becoming a UFC champion.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage of UFC 323, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!\nThere's plenty more to watch on this event in Vegas. A decorated combat athlete is set for his final walk to the Octagon when former two-division champion Henry Cejudo takes on rising prospect Payton Talbott. Cejudo told CBS Sports this week that he's ready for a new challenge after previously retiring from the sport in 2020. The 38-year-old also won Olympic gold in wrestling at the 2008 Beijing Games. Plus, former flyweight champion Brandon Moreno looks to hold on to his spot in the rankings when he takes on rising contender Tatsuro Taira. Moreno has lost twice as a pro to Pantoja, but could get back in the title picture if he and Van win on Saturday.\n        \n            \n                Merab Dvalishvili, UFC's ironman, isn't human, he's a 'Machine' as he attempts to make history\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith so much happening on Saturday night, let's look closer at the full fight card with the latest odds before we get to our staff predictions and picks for the PPV portion of the festivities that you can consider before hitting the sportsbooks.UFC 323 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookMerab Dvalishvili -425 (c) vs. Petr Yan +330, bantamweight titleAlexandre Pantoja -238 (c) vs. Joshua Van +195, flyweight titleTatsuro Taira -122 vs. Brandon Moreno +102, flyweightsPayton Talbott -278 vs. Henry Cejudo +225, bantamweightsJan Blachowicz -135 vs. Bogdan Guskov +114, light heavyweightsGrant Dawson -218 vs. Manuel Torres +180, lightweightsChris Duncan -166 vs. Terrance McKinney +140, lightweightsMaycee Barber -180 vs. Karine Silva +150, women's flyweightsFares Ziam -135 vs. Nazim Sadykhov +114, lightweightsMarvin Vettori -115 vs. Bruno Ferreira -105, middleweightsJalin Turner -298 vs. Edson Barboza +240, lightweightsIwo Baraniewski -192 vs. Ibo Aslan +160, light heavyweightsMansur Abdul-Malik -1150 vs. Antonio Trocoli +650, middleweightsMairon Santos -258 vs. Muhammad Naimov +210, featherweightsUFC 323 predictions, picksWith such a massive main event on tap, the crew at CBS Sports went ahead with predictions and picks for the main card from Brian Campbell, Brent Brookhouse, Shakiel Mahjouri, Michael Mormile and Brandon Wise.\n   CampbellBrookhouseMahjouriMormileWiseMerab (c) vs. YanMerabMerabMerabMerabYanPantoja (c) vs. VanPantojaPantojaPantojaPantojaPantojaTaira vs. MorenoMorenoMorenoMorenoMorenoTairaCejudo vs. TalbottTalbottTalbottCejudoCejudoTalbottBlachowicz vs. GuskovGuskovBlachowiczBlachowiczBlachowiczBlachowiczMerab Dvalishvili vs. Petr Yan predictionsCampbell: Death, taxes and Dvalishvili by decision. That has been the reality for the bantamweight division throughout most of the last seven years as Dvalishvili has run off 14 consecutive wins. While the well-rounded Yan was compromised in their first meeting in 2023 due to an injured hand, so was Dvalishvili, who has a history of persevering through physical setbacks. The recharged Yan might have the power and takedown defense to provide resistance (and this being Dvalishvili's fourth fight of 2025 needs to be acknowledged) but until another 135-pound fighter can prove he can go 25 minutes with Dvalishvili and not be overwhelmed by the volume of strikes and endless takedown attempts in order to drain their gas tank, it's not time to pick against the champion. Brookhouse: Dvalishvili is a pain to deal with; that much is obvious. But he's also so good at what he does that there's no real way to gameplan against him. Yan stuffed a ton of Dvalishvili takedowns in their first fight, but he still got blown out on the scorecards. Where the mystery lies is in whether Dvalishvili will be compromised by a fourth camp and weight cut in this calendar year. If Dvalishvili comes in as his normal self, it seems like it's going to take a home run shot from Yan that stops Dvalishvili immediately to get the victory. How has that worked for anyone recently against the champ?Mahjouri: Recency bias is a messy thing. Alex Pereira's revelation that he was compromised in his first fight against Magomed Ankalaev, and his subsequent return to form in the rematch, has led some to put too much stock in Petr Yan's injury claims. Yan recently claimed he fought Dvalishvili with an injured hand the first time. However, people forget that Dvalishvili also allegedly had a hand injury. The point is: fighters rarely compete at 100%. Injuries are worth factoring, but we must first and foremost observe the data. The data shows that Dvalishvili is the superior fighter. Dvalishvili overwhelmed Yan the first time, and he's only improving. A second win over Yan means that Dvalishvili will have defeated the top four bantamweight contenders in less than a year. By contrast, while Yan has certainly regained momentum on his three-fight win streak, none of the people he beat are on par with the three UFC champions -- Aljamain Sterling, Sean O'Malley, and Dvalishvili -- that he lost to. It's great to see Yan find his groove, but he's here mostly so that Dvalishvili can make history as the first champion to make four successful defenses in one year.\nWho wins UFC 323: Dvalishvili vs. Yan 2, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.Alexandre Pantoja vs. Joshua Van predictionsCampbell: At 24, Van represents an incredible story as he seeks to become the second-youngest champion in UFC history. But what Van doesn't yet know about facing an elite and experienced fighter such as the pound-for-pound ranked Pantoja is simply too much to overcome at such a young age. Look for Pantoja to mix the threat of the takedown with his technical striking to navigate some hairy two-way exchanges early before settling in and using Van's aggressiveness against him. A late-round submission isn't out of the question for the accomplished flyweight king as he defends his title for the fifth time. Brookhouse: Van is probably a future champion. Pantoja doesn't seem like the kind of champion Van is ready to beat yet in this moment. Pantoja is just so crafty, so slick and so dominant that Van has never faced anything like him before. Van is also fighting for a fourth time this year, so the same questions that applied to Dvalishvili apply to him. Van hasn't shown a proven ability to finish fights at this level, while Pantoja is an absolute monster the second he senses an opponent is on the ropes, or has made a mistake that leaves them open. If Van can win a round or two and make it to the scorecards, it would be a huge win for the 24-year-old, but I fear we're stuck looking for moral victories for Van and little more.\nMahjouri: Saturday's co-main event has many thrilling contrasts: experience vs. youth, grappling vs. striking, and underappreciated excellence vs. the hot new thing. Pantoja is a beast who's quietly put together a flyweight resume second only to Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. He has the most overall wins, finishes, and submissions, and the second-most title fight wins in flyweight history. The champ pairs an in-your-face brawling style with great wrestling and even better back control. His rear-naked choke is particularly deadly, and he's never been finished in 35 professional fights. If there's someone who can crack that legendary chin, especially with Pantoja at 35, it's the challenger. Van is arguably the best pure striker in the division who's roared to title contention with five wins in under 12 months. His takedown defense could use work, but he's terrific at getting to his feet quickly. This fight comes down to whose strong defensive game crumbles first: Pantoja's chin or Van's ability to get off the mat. Pantoja's pace is another important factor, considering Van has never fought for more than 15 minutes. There's a strong case to be made for either fighter, but Pantoja's pace and experience should get him a decision win or late submission.Brandon Moreno vs. Tatsuro Taira predictionsCampbell: In a fight which could go a long way in producing the next 125-pound title challenger, don't count out how much the 31-year-old Moreno, a former two-time flyweight champion, still has left in the tank. Over his last six fights, Moreno's only defeats have come by disputed split decision and he rebounded nicely to produce back-to-back wins over Amir Albazi and Steve Erceg. The 25-year-old Taira is exciting but still far too reckless for the boxing of Moreno, who has leaned into a more technical approach in recent years and should have enough to keep himself firmly entrenched in the title picture.Brookhouse: Moreno may have had a small skid in losing split decisions to Alexandre Pantoja and Brandon Royval back-to-back, but the two wins that followed proved Moreno is still a handful for anyone in the flyweight division. Taira is a fun and exciting fighter and has the pop in his strikes, so this is not an easy fight for Moreno, but I do believe that proven high-level experience is always a factor to take into consideration. Moreno is 31, which isn't young in the lightest division, but he's not showing signs of his best days being behind him. The way Moreno can navigate tricky situations against even the best fighters in the world is a special trait. Taira might be able to explode his way to a victory, but I'm riding with the proven veteran in this one.\nMahjouri: Moreno is about to make himself an undeniable contender after consecutive split decision losses to Pantoja and Brandon Royval. The former two-time flyweight champ has done this by turning away each rising young star put in front of him. Taira is another in that new wave of flyweights trying to replace the old guard. Moreno is so well-rounded, blending elusive striking with a dogged wrestling game. Taira is very offensively oriented, leaving major gaps in his striking and takedown defense. Moreno, who has never been stopped in 33 pro fights, should feast on that for 15 minutes. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Though only 10 of the 25 teams who were ranked in the AP Top 25 poll were in action during Week 15, also known as championship weekend, the results are going to provide some notable changes in the college football rankings. For starters, this is the final set of results before the College Football Playoff is set. And while the AP voters do not have the power of the selection committee in terms of determining who gets what seed in the bracket, the pollsters are going to make their opinion known with their last ballot before the final update at the end of the year. The conversation about who gets what spot in the rankings starts at the very top, where No. 2 Indiana toppled No. 1 Ohio State for its first outright Big Ten title since 1945. The Hoosiers are the only 13-0 team in America and will almost certainly take over the No. 1 spot in both the AP poll and the College Football Playoff Rankings. Ohio State will drop, but likely not far, and potentially would have only fallen to No. 2 if not for Georgia's impressive dominance against Alabama in the SEC Championship Game. We are projecting that both the Bulldogs and Texas Tech will be moving up within the top five in the updated rankings, as voters reward both teams for logging wins in their respective title games. There is also an aspect to the AP voters weighing in on some of the College Football Playoff debates of the morning, such as how to order Alabama, Notre Dame and Miami in the wake of losses for both the Crimson Tide and BYU. The Cougars appear to be on the outside looking in on the CFP debate, but voters have 25 spots to fill out and must wrestle how to re-rank these championship week participants around other teams that were idle this weekend. And while much of Sunday will be dedicated to the CFP bracket and bowl game announcements, we hear at Tomorrow's Top 25 Today will be be taking note of where teams are positioned heading into the postseason. It's important because the final AP ranking, the one that is done after the national championship, is the widely accepted ranking set that is used as a snapshot of the season moving forward. The College Football Playoff Rankings power the late-season discussion and ultimately set the national title race in motion, but the selection committee does not circle back after the playoff and the bowls for a final ranking. That responsibility will be on the AP voters, who are making their penultimate ballot changes here after the championship game results of Friday and Saturday.  \nHere's how we think the new AP Top 25 poll will look after championship weekend results: 1. Indiana (2): The Hoosiers might not be a unanimous No. 1, but the expectation is that they will be an overwhelming selection for the top spot after handing Ohio State its only loss of the season and finishing as 13-0 Big Ten champs. Combined with the road win at Oregon, you can argue Indiana has two of the most impressive wins in the country and now will likely enter the College Football Playoff in the top spot.    2. Georgia (3): The presence of a 13-0 Big Ten champion coming off a win against a top-two opponent will make it very difficult for Georgia to launch all the way to No. 1. That said, there is enough of an argument to think a couple first-place votes will float Georgia's way after dominating Alabama and holding the Crimson Tide to -3 rushing yards in a 21-point win. A voter who wants to throw additional support behind Georgia can argue that the Bulldogs have gotten revenge for their only defeat from the regular season and now have as many ranked wins as anyone else in the country.  \n3. Ohio State (2): The No. 3 spot might be the floor for the Buckeyes, who will be ranked No. 2 on plenty of ballots. The Buckeyes are usually in the position of being someone else's quality loss, but now Ohio State is the team arguing that it should be ranked highly because its only defeat came against the No. 1 team in the country.  4. Texas Tech (5): A slight bump up in the rankings will come as a response to Texas Tech posting yet another 20+ point victory and doing so on a massive stage in the Big 12 title game. Each of Texas Tech's 12 wins have been by at least 20 points, and the only loss of the season (26-22 at Arizona State) was impacted by an injury to starting quarterback Behren Morton. The ceiling for Texas Tech's rise is No. 3, but we're thinking it's just a one-spot jump as voters offer a little bit of respect. 5. Oregon (4): The Ducks were off in Week 15 and will find out their College Football Playoff future on Sunday. \n6. Ole Miss (6): The Rebels were off in Week 15 and will find out their College Football Playoff future on Sunday. 7. Texas A&M (7): The Aggies were off in Week 15 and will find out their College Football Playoff future on Sunday. 8. Oklahoma (8): The Sooners were off in Week 15 and will find out their College Football Playoff future on Sunday. \n9. Notre Dame (9): Whether the Fighting Irish are in jeopardy of losing their spot inside the field will be determined by the College Football Playoff Selection Committee. As for the AP Top 25 voters? We're projecting there will be no change when it comes to the Fighting Irish being ahead of Miami. 10. Miami (12): A weekend full of rhetoric regarding Miami and the Hurricanes' possible place in the playoff picture is bound to have enough of an impact on voters to see some upward movement given results elsewhere in the rankings. With both Alabama (No. 10) and BYU (No. 11) losing on championship weekend by 20+ points, there is room to see the Hurricanes join the top 10. 11. Alabama (10): It's possible the Crimson Tide could drop farther, but the head-to-head win against Vanderbilt keeps a pretty high ceiling on voters' adjustment, even as Alabama picked up its third loss of the season. \n12. Vanderbilt (13): The Commodores were off in Week 15 and will find out their likely bowl destination on Sunday. 13. Texas (14): The Longhorns were off in Week 15 and will find out their likely bowl destination on Sunday. 14. BYU (11): Voters' adjustment for the Cougars is made easier by the head-to-head against Utah, which also has just two losses on the season. BYU has more wins (11) than the other teams in this range of the rankings but got out-classed by Texas Tech in the Big 12 title game and now gets reclassified into a new tier on the ballot. \n15. Utah (15): The Utes were off in Week 15 and will find out their bowl destination on Sunday. 16. USC (17): The Trojans were off in Week 15 and will find out their bowl destination on Sunday. 17. Michigan (18): The Wolverines were off in Week 15 and will find out their bowl destination on Sunday. \n18. Tulane (21): Last week's voting had Tulane just 25 voting points away from North Texas at No. 20 and 40 voting points away from James Madison at No. 19. Given the impressive nature of Friday night's 34-21 win against North Texas in the American Championship Game, holding the Mean Green to their lowest scoring output of the season, we could see voters who were supporting both AAC squads join together behind Tulane's ranking effort and give them the boost needed to jump up in the rankings. 19. James Madison (19): It's possible that the Dukes move up a spot and jump Michigan in the wake of their 31-14 win against Troy in the Sun Belt Championship Game. But it's arguably more likely that JMU gets jumped by a surge of support behind Tulane, which is our projection here. The Dukes will find out their postseason future on Sunday, which of course is impacted by results elsewhere on Saturday night. 20. Arizona (22): The Wildcats were off in Week 15 and will find out their bowl destination on Sunday. \n21. North Texas (20): Voters should have an easy time slotting North Texas on their ballots thanks to a head-to-head win against Navy, which was No. 23 last week. The 11-2 resume isn't loaded up with high-end wins, but that victory against the Midshipmen will prove valuable to keeping the team ranked in the AP poll heading into the postseason. 22. Navy (23): The campaign is not done for Navy, which is 9-2 and will take center stage next week in America's Game against Army for its regular-season finale. 23. Georgia Tech (24): The Yellow Jackets were off in Week 15 and will find out their bowl destination on Sunday. \n24. Missouri (25): It's hard for a team to fall out of the top 25 without playing a game, but keep your eye on this spot for possible overlooked turnover on Sunday. The Tigers got just 73 voting points last week, while Tennessee had 71. It won't take too many ballots to change for that to flip, or maybe for Mountain West champion Boise State to crash the top 25 after beating a UNLV team that was 29th in last week's voting. 25. Boise State (NR): We were already prepared for Boise State to land inside the top 30 in voting points thanks to a 38-21 win in the Mountain West Championship Game against UNLV, and then Virginia's loss opened up the room for the Broncos to crash the rankings. Boise State closed the season with three straight wins to finish 9-4, and of those losses one came to Notre Dame and one came with starting quarterback Maddux Madsen getting knocked out of the game.  Projected to drop out: No. 16 Virginia\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With less than 24 hours remaining until the 12-team College Football Playoff bracket is revealed, oddsmakers have it clear who may be receiving the final at-large spots. Notre Dame (-1050) is heavily favored to reach the CFP via an at-large bid, while Alabama (-320) and Miami (+164) are right behind.Texas is also being offered long-shot odds (+2500) to reach the CFP, but the Longhorns will more than likely be on the outside looking in on Sunday afternoon. Those odds are current at FanDuel Sportsbook as of 9:50 p.m. ET on Saturday.Entering the weekend, up to two at-large spots were likely up for grabs. With most teams idle during conference championship week, only a few had one final opportunity to present their respective case to the committee. BYU entered the weekend likely needing to beat Texas Tech in the Big 12 title game to secure an automatic bid to the CFP. \n        \n            \n                It's fair to question Alabama's College Football Playoff legitimacy after lopsided SEC Championship Game loss\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, the Cougars fell 34-7 to the Red Raiders, making their case to receive an at-large bid a complicated one. The Cougars' lone two losses this season have both come against Texas Tech.\nIn the penultimate CFP rankings released earlier this week, Alabama jumped to No. 9 -- ahead of Notre Dame, BYU and Miami. One of the biggest talking points throughout the last several weeks was Miami's 27-24 win over Notre Dame in Week 1. However, Notre Dame has stayed ahead of Miami in the CFP rankings and has won 10 consecutive games.The contenders vying for an at-large bid to the CFPMiami (10-2) began the season 5-0 before suffering its first loss at home to Louisville. Two weeks later, the Hurricanes lost to SMU 26-20 in overtime, which dropped Miami to 6-2 overall and 2-2 in ACC play. Despite winning their last four games, Miami was left out of the ACC title game due to tiebreakers.Notre Dame (10-2) began the season with losses to Miami and Texas A&M before finishing the regular season with a 10-game win streak. The Fighting Irish own wins over Mountain West champion Boise State, USC and Pitt. Notre Dame is seeking its second consecutive CFP appearance after reaching the semifinals last season.\nAlabama (10-3) could become the first team in the CFP era to receive an at-large bid with three losses on its résume after losing to Georgia 28-7 in the SEC title game. Last season, Clemson reached the CFP by winning the ACC title despite having three losses on its résumé. Alabama is seeking its first CFP appearance in the post-Nick Saban era.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anytime touchdown bets have become very popular these days. Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know, and I'm here to offer some insight for your parlays.Last week, I predicted Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Brenton Strange would score his first touchdown of the season at +340, and also got Denver Broncos wideout Courtland Sutton at +170. Previously, he had caught just one touchdown in the last seven games, so I knew he was due against a spotty Washington Commanders secondary. Below, we will break down five anytime TD bets to consider for Week 14. These will not be predictable choices like a Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long-shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with a wide receiver who is getting his quarterback back. Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:1. WR Terry McLaurin, Washington Commanders (+200)\nJayden Daniels is back in the lineup for this Week 14 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, which is a good thing for Terry McLaurin. Washington's WR1 has finally arrived, as he had his best performance of the season in the overtime loss to the Broncos last week, catching 7 of 14 targets from Marcus Mariota for 96 yards and a touchdown. McLaurin isn't just a big-play threat, but a weapon targeted in the red zone as well. Last season, he set a franchise record with 13 touchdown receptions. \n2. TE Mark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens (+170)\nLamar Jackson hasn't registered a touchdown in three straight starts for the first time in his career, but that's going to change this Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ravens tight end Mark Andrews signed a three-year, $39.3 million extension this past week that reportedly includes $26 million guaranteed, which shows you how much the franchise values him. I'll take Andrews to find pay dirt on Sunday.3. TE Darren Waller. Miami Dolphins (+240)\nHere's an interesting flier. Remember when Darren Waller made his Dolphins debut in Week 4 and caught two touchdowns? Then caught touchdowns in each of the next two games as well? Waller made his return to the lineup last week against the New Orleans Saints after a stint on injured reserve, and caught two passes for 47 yards. This week, he will score vs. the New York Jets. 4. RB D'Andre Swift, Chicago Bears (+190)\nThe Bears' running backs were a major reason why Chicago upset the Philadelphia Eagles last week, as Kyle Monangai and D'Andre Swift became the first teammates in franchise history to rush for 125 yards and a touchdown in the same game. Monangai rushed 22 times for 130 yards and a score, while Swift rushed 18 times for 125 yards and a touchdown against his former team. Monangai is dealing with an ankle injury, but will play. So give me Swift to score in this important NFC North showdown. \n5. RB Kyren Williams, Los Angeles Rams (-105)\nThe Rams are looking to avenge their shocking upset loss to the Carolina Panthers this week, and get a rival that was just eliminated from playoff contention in the Arizona Cardinals. I think points are coming. Kyren Williams has scored touchdowns in eight of 12 games played this season, so he's a good pick for your parlay. This line was plus money on Friday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff Selection Committee will not have it easy this weekend trying to decide the final at-large spots coming out of various conference championship game results. Ninth-ranked Alabama's one-sided loss to No. 3 Georgia is an intriguing -- and unexpected -- additional data point for the committee, who could critically dock the SEC's runner-up in favor of Miami for the 12-team bracket's final at-large spot.However, the committee would have to devalue the SEC Championship Game for the first time in playoff history for the Crimson Tide to be left out entirely in favor of the No. 9 and 10 spots going to Notre Dame and the Hurricanes. No team in playoff history has reached the postseason as a three-loss, at-large nominee, nor has an at-large team lost multiple games by 10 or more points during the season. Alabama is trying to become the first on both accounts.Now, there is precedent for a committee dropping a team that was idle for no reason. In 2014, TCU dropped from No. 3 to No. 6 in the final rankings after beating Iowa State 55-3 when the Big 12 did not hold a conference championship game that season. Florida State and Ohio State made the first four-team playoff that year instead as the Nos. 3 and 4 seeds after winning the ACC and Big Ten title games.The ACC's doomsday scenario is in play following Duke's win over Virginia, which leaves the 12 seed up in the air between James Madison and the Blue Devils. Considering JMU was slotted 25th earlier this week and we don't know where the committee power-rated Duke, that's a bad situation unfolding for the ACC, which could be left out entirely. \nIndiana is college football's lone unbeaten entering the postseason after knocking off defending national champion Ohio State in the Big Ten showdown. And the Hoosiers have earned top billing by taking out the previously top-ranked Buckeyes on Saturday night in Indianapolis.Here's a glance at how we see the final 12-team CFP bracket unfolding Sunday coming out of championship weekend:College Football Playoff Quarterfinals DateGame / LocationProjectionJan. 1 Rose BowlPasadena, Calif.(1) Indiana vs. (8/9) WinnerJan. 1 Cotton BowlArlington, Texas(2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) WinnerJan. 1 Sugar BowlNew Orleans(3) Georgia vs. (6/11) WinnerDec. 31 Orange BowlMiami, Fla.(4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) WinnerFirst roundDate LocationProjectionWinner facesDec. 19 or 20Oklahoma Memorial StadiumNorman, Oklahoma(9) Notre Dame at (8) Oklahoma (1) IndianaDec. 19 or 20Kyle FieldCollege Station, Texas(10) Alabama at (7) Texas A&M(2) Ohio StateDec. 19 or 20Vaught-Hemingway StadiumOxford, Mississippi(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss(3) GeorgiaDec. 19 or 20Autzen StadiumEugene, Oregon(12) James Madison at (5) Oregon(4) Texas TechDon't see your team? Check out Brad Crawford's complete bowl projections.Projected College Football Playoff Field breakdown1. Indiana: What a finish from the Hoosiers. The committee will move Indiana to No. 1 in the rankings following its win over Ohio State. Indiana has there wins this season over ranked competition, but this was the best of the year against the unbeaten defending national champions.2. Ohio State: After getting through the gauntlet of last season's playoff as a low-seed, the Buckeyes are going to be one of the teams to beat this time around after nearly getting through the regular season and the Big Ten Championship Game unscathed. Losing to Indiana hurts, but the Buckeyes have been here before and now start their trek toward another title. 3. Georgia: The Bulldogs should move into the No. 3 slot as the SEC champions, especially after their beatdown of Alabama on the grand stage in Atlanta to avenge their only loss of the season against the Crimson Tide. It was a vintage performance defensively after Georgia limited the Crimson Tide to negative yardage on the ground with Alabama's lone score coming in the fourth quarter. No team in the country outside of Ohio State played better down the stretch against stiff competition than the Bulldogs.4. Texas Tech: The first 12-win season in school history and a conference championship won. That's a key element in the Red Raiders potentially moving ahead of Big Ten runner-up Ohio State in Sunday's final rankings. The Red Raiders dominated the Big 12 Championship Game, torching the league's second-best team -- BYU -- for a second time this season. The committee has a decision to make for the Nos. 2, 3 and 4 spots.5. Oregon: The Ducks saved their best execution for late in the season, running off six straight wins -- including a pair over ranked teams since the loss to Indiana -- to secure a first-round home game. Oregon's hoping to get wideouts Gary Bryant Jr. and Dakorien Moore back for the opening round and is trying to win its first playoff game under Lanning after falling to Ohio State in last year's quarterfinals at the Rose Bowl.6. Ole Miss: Not only did losing Lane Kiffin not affect the Rebels' standing, but the committee boosted Ole Miss last week after routing Mississippi State on the road to finish 11-1. The promotion of Pete Golding to head coach coupled with Charlie Weis Jr. returning to Oxford to call plays for a postseason run strengthened the committee's opinion of Ole Miss, though we didn't hear that publicly. Trinidad Chambliss and the Rebels will get a first-round home game with a chance to move on to the quarterfinals as a betting favorite.7. Texas A&M: After sliding behind Ole Miss last week, the Aggies will be at home in the first round as a one-loss SEC selection from the at-large group. Texas A&M squandered an opening-round bye opportunity in the finale at Texas, but a victory at Notre Dame this season was one of the nation's best, and they tip-toed around several SEC opponents down the stretch to finish off one of the best regular seasons in program history.8. Oklahoma: The committee never wavered on the Sooners despite this offense struggling to produce over its final four games of the season. Oklahoma's win at Alabama stamped its playoff trip in the first of three elimination games the Sooners won in November to get to the first round. This defense is as stout as any in the field, but it looks like Oklahoma will have to win ugly to keep it going as a title threat.9. Notre Dame: The most debated final two at-large spots in playoff history is unfolding between three bluebloods, and if the committee follows the same path they've taken the last five weeks, the Fighting Irish and Crimson Tide will be the choices at Nos. 9 and 10 over Miami. Notre Dame had a resume-booster while the Fighting Irish and Hurricanes were idle during championship weekend as well following Boise State's win in the Mountain West Championship Game. Notre Dame beat the Broncos earlier this season, 28-7.10. Alabama: The Crimson Tide should be very thankful the committee moved them to No. 9 last week ahead of the SEC Championship Game with Georgia. It acted as a built-in buffer, essentially. Following Saturday's lackluster play against the Bulldogs, Alabama would be out in favor of Miami had Kalen DeBoer's squad still been in the No. 10 spot coming into championship weekend. Now, the committee can simply move Alabama back one spot and avoid the Notre Dame-Miami dilemma altogether. That's where we're projecting Alabama to be in the final rankings, just ahead of the Hurricanes for the final at-large spot. Also, by seeding Notre Dame and Alabama at Nos. 9 and 10, the committee avoids regular-season rematches in the opening round of the playoff.11. Tulane: The highest-ranked Group of Five team entering conference championship weekend, the Green Wave ran away from North Texas in the first half and never looked back to win the American under outgoing coach Jon Sumrall. Tulane will be on the road in the first round, likely facing Oregon at Autzen Stadium as a double-digit underdog.12. James Madison: Unless the committee was convinced by five-loss Duke that the Blue Devils are worth a spot in the playoff, then JMU is going to get the final auto-bid designation by being ranked higher in the final top 25. The Dukes didn't pass the eye test in the Sun Belt final against Troy, but it was their 12th win -- and that's four more than Duke this season. Plus, JMU was ranked 25th in Tuesday's penultimate rankings.Bowl intel beyond the playoff bracketThe Notre Dame-Miami debate for the committee has significant implications for a few of the highest-tier bowl games outside of the playoff. The Fighting Irish are eligible for any of the ACC's bowl slots, which includes the Pop-Tarts Bowl and Gator Bowl. One bowl source told CBS Sports this week BYU is expected to be chosen to fill the Big 12's tie-in for the Pop-Tarts Bowl against one of the ACC's highest finishers. Based on our final playoff projection, that's either Miami, Duke or Virginia.Miami played in the Pop-Tarts Bowl last bowl season, so the Hurricanes would also be a welcomed option for the Gator Bowl against a 10-win Vanderbilt team if not selected for the playoff. Tennessee is also being considered for the game in Jacksonville on Dec. 27, a source told CBS Sports on Saturday. If the Vols play in the Gator, Vanderbilt would likely play in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa against Iowa, per team sources.One of the postseason's top games outside of the playoff, the Citrus Bowl gets first selection of SEC and Big Ten teams once the 12-team bracket is set and the highest-ranked remaining teams in each league are often selected. We expect Texas (9-3) be the choice in Orlando from the SEC side — unless Alabama is left out of the playoff bracket — and Michigan as the Big Ten's representative. The Wolverines (9-3) last played in the Citrus to end the 2019 season while the Longhorns would be a first-time participant.After the Citrus Bowl selects a team, there will be a pool of six bowls and the conference -- in consultation with the institutions and the bowls -- will make the assignments for this group from all eligible remaining SEC teams. With the SEC being unable to fill its bowl allotment this season after six teams finished with five or fewer wins, one of the league's tie-ins this month will not get a conference team. We're expecting that to be the Mayo Bowl in Charlotte.Kansas State (6-6) declined a bowl opportunity and sources tell CBS Sports that Rice (5-7) is being considered for that final spot based on its high Academic Progress Rate (APR) ranking. Auburn (5-7) would be next in line, but would likely decline to focus on recruiting and its new staff under Alex Golesh. The Owls have made it clear they would be interested in playing another game this season.Also in the Big Ten, there was multiple game wanting Penn State (6-6), but a source confirmed Saturday the Nittany Lions are heading to Yankee Stadum to play an ACC opponent in the Pinstripe Bowl. In other yet-to-be-announced Big Ten designations, we expect Nebraska to play in the Las Vegas Bowl, Iowa in the ReliaQuest Bowl and Illinois in the Music City Bowl, among others.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the 12-team College Football Playoff field is unveiled Sunday afternoon, Alabama will almost certainly be included. That felt like an inevitability when the selection committee moved the Crimson Tide up one spot to No. 9 in its latest rankings, jumping a Notre Dame team that closed the regular season with a far more convincing rivalry win.It probably doesn't matter that Alabama didn't look like it belonged on the same field as No. 3 Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. The Bulldogs earned a rare breakthrough over their growing rival, rolling to a 28-7 win that was even more lopsided than the final score suggested.Alabama rushed for minus-3 yards as a team and didn't eclipse 100 total yards until late in the third quarter. Though the Tide beat Georgia in the regular season, they've scored just seven points in their last six quarters against the Bulldogs.It's almost impossible to imagine a scenario in which Alabama doesn't make the playoff, but it's fair to question whether the Tide actually deserve the honor.\n\"They are not (a Playoff team),\" said Damien Harris, the CBS College Football analyst who was a two-time national champion at Alabama. \"This Alabama team, specifically the offense, it did not look Playoff-caliber.\"Alabama would become the first three-loss at-large playoff team and the first at-large team to suffer two double-digit losses in the same season. Alabama would be slotted ahead of several deserving two-loss programs, including No. 11 BYU -- which went 11-1 in the regular season and lost in the Big 12 Championship Game on Saturday -- and No. 12 Miami.While teams like Notre Dame, Miami and -- before the postseason began -- BYU have played their best football since the committee started releasing weekly rankings, Alabama is trending the opposite direction. The Tide are 2-2 against FBS opponents since Nov. 1, averaging 17 points per game and surpassing 21 points only once.\nThey're also 0-2 against currently ranked opponents since Oct. 4 and have rarely looked convincing even in victory. An 11-point win over a rudderless LSU team and a narrow seven-point escape against an Auburn squad that finished with one SEC win hardly move the needle.Alabama also carries the worst loss of any bubble team. The Tide were one of three Power Four teams beaten by Florida State this season. Their only saving grace is that the 14-point defeat came in the opener; had it occurred in November, Alabama would be out of the discussion entirely.The offensive collapse is the biggest culprit. Kalen DeBoer's group cannot consistently run the ball without Jam Miller, and even with him, the ground attack is unreliable. Alabama ranks 13th in the SEC in rushing at 126.2 yards per game.\nQuarterback Ty Simpson shares some of the blame. He once looked like a legitimate Heisman contender, but he has been largely ineffective over the past month. He threw his fourth interception in as many games in the SEC title loss to Georgia and failed to complete 50% of his passes. Simpson is averaging 160.3 passing yards over Alabama's last three games. He's not solely responsible for Alabama's position on the bubble, but the Tide offense as a whole looks pedestrian against comparable competition.There's no telling which direction the selection committee will go — even if its recent decisions strongly suggest Alabama won't fall out. But the Tide are far from the undeniable juggernaut many believed them to be earlier in the season.\n            ",

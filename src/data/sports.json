Meanwhile, Ole Miss is 6-0, including 3-0 in the SEC. Ole Miss has covered the spread in three of its last four games, but Saturday will be its first time as the underdog this season.

The Vols are coming off a 34-31 victory last week, but even that contest finished below its over/under of 68.5 points. This matchup pits one of the best scoring offenses in the nation against an elite defensive unit, with Tennessee ranking third at 43.4 ppg, while Alabama has the 15th-best scoring defense at 17.3 ppg allowed this season.

    "body": "\n        The Week 7 Fantasy football rankings have been impacted by injuries at receiver in a big way. Puka Nacua (ankle), Terry McLaurin (quad), Calvin Ridley (hamstring), Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Chris Godwin (fibula) are among the receivers who have been ruled out. Garrett Wilson (knee), meanwhile, is doubtful. A couple big names, however, are returning as CeeDee Lamb (ankle) has been cleared and Rashee Rice is returning from suspension.How should those wide receiver injuries impact your Week 7 Fantasy football picks, and which sleepers at every position should you target as byes and injuries thin lineup options?

Much of Hurts' Fantasy production has come from the ground but he's had just 15 total rushing yards over the last two weeks and is averaging his fewest rushing yards per game in five years. Then there's what Hurt has done, or hasn't done, as a passer as he's part of the 29th-ranked passing offense in the league.Hurts ranks just 26th in passing yards per game and is tied for 25th in passing touchdowns per game. On Sunday, he'll have to face possibly the best pass defense in the league as the Vikings have allowed the second-fewest yards through the air and the fourth-fewest passing touchdowns. Only two teams have given up fewer Fantasy points to quarterbacks than Minnesota, and with Hurts ranking outside the top 12 in Week 7 Fantasy football QB rankings, he may not warrant a spot in lineups.Another curveball: The model is high on Chargers running back Kimani Vidal, who has an over/under of 58.5 rushing yards. With Najee Harris first exiting the lineup, and then Omarion Hampton doing the same, Vidal is the next man up in Los Angeles' backfield. He didn't disappoint in his first career start in Week 6 as he ran 18 times for 124 yards while adding 14 yards and a score through the air. He also dominated the time share in L.A.'s backfield with more than twice as many snaps (43) as backup Hassan Haskins (20). The Chargers rank third in yards per rush attempt, so whomever lines up in their backfield seems destined for success. Vidal and L.A. will take on the Colts on Sunday, and Indy ranks 19th in yards per carry allowed. Five of the six starting RBs that Indianapolis has faced have either 94-plus scrimmage yards or a touchdown in 2025. Vidal is a top-15 Fantasy running back this week, making him a must-start in all sized leagues.

    "body": "\n        VANCOUVER -- Brendan Allen stands in the way of Reinier de Ridder's audition for a UFC middleweight title shot. An impressive showcase at UFC Fight Night is paramount if De Ridder wants to improve his case for a fight with Khamzat Chimaev.De Ridder (21-2) was originally scheduled to fight Anthony \"Fluffy\" Hernandez on Saturday, part of a spiritual sweepstakes to find Chimaev's next challenger. The other half of the equation is Nassourdine Imavov, who beat Caio Borralho last month. De Ridder is grateful that Allen stepped up on short notice, but knows a finish is crucial against an opponent less lauded than Hernandez.\"It still means something beating him,\" De Ridder told CBS Sports of Allen. \"He had close fights with Imavov and 'Fluffy.' At least he has history with top guys. I think if I'm the first guy, of the three, to finish him, that means something.\"There isn't a rigid linear path to earning a title shot. Imavov (No. 2) will be ranked higher in the UFC's official middleweight rankings even if De Ridder beats Allen. Imavov also has higher-ranked wins on his record. But De Ridder will have a couple of things going for him with another win: a 5-0 UFC run in 11 months, and a strength of schedule that makes him a reliable challenger in a pinch.\n\n        \n            \n                Reinier de Ridder thinks he can take down, choke out UFC middleweight champion Khamzat Chimaev\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I've done a lot this year. Imavov has done a lot as well, of course. I say we could have figured out together here as well. He could have said, 'Yes.' He could have shown up,\" De Ridder said of Imavov. \"I know there are a lot of reasons not to. He just fought, but if you really wanted to figure out who the next guy was, he could have been here.\"Allen (25-7) has a stubbornness to him. It's served him well for most of his career, but sometimes raises eyebrows. Allen claims he has a case for having won his fights with Imavov and Hernandez, despite all official judges and polled media members scoring against him. Most believe Saturday's main event will be competitive, but Allen didn't seem very concerned with De Ridder.\"His strength is definitely weighing on guys and being durable. His jiu-jitsu isn't bad at all,\" Allen told CBS Sports. \"I think I'm pretty good everywhere. Especially when I'm mentally good, locked and focused, I think I'm the best in the world. I think I'll beat him everywhere.\"\nCheck out the full interview with Reinier de Ridder below.\nWhile De Ridder and Allen fight for supremacy near the top of the middleweight division, numerous fledgling contenders are working their way up the ranks. Jasmine Jasudavicius is Canada's next hope for a UFC champion. The country hasn't tasted UFC gold since Georges St-Pierre won the middleweight title in 2017. A win over Manon Fiorot, who recently fought women's flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko, puts Jasudavicius near the top of the queue.\"All of the above,\" Jasudavicius told CBS Sports when asked if the pressure is stressful or a badge of honor. \"I'm super excited to be put in this opportunity and this place. To be able to do this is unbelievable. I'm truly looking forward to it. Of course, I'm nervous, but that comes with it.\"\"She puts a lot of pressure on people,\" Fiorot told CBS Sports when breaking down the fight. \"She goes forward every time. She loves to take people down and take the back. I punch and move, and fight with space.\"\nAiemann Zahabi, younger brother of St-Pierre's longtime coach Firas Zahabi, is another rising Canadian star. Zahabi accumulated six straight wins after a rough UFC start. Most recently, he won a controversial decision over former UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo. To continue his ascent, he must vanquish recent title challenger Marlon Vera. \"Chito\" has his back against the wall after a first-time consecutive losses, but hopes his one-year hiatus, used to heal his body and shed his ego, produces results.\"We really didn't like each other,\" Vera said of his failed bid for the UFC bantamweight title against Sean O'Malley. \"If I have to be honest, I'm not the most respectful f---ing person. I fought with my dick. I didn't fight smartly at all. My whole thought process was, 'I want to kill this guy. I want to hurt him. I want to step on his throat and throw a rug on his face.' That's literally how I fought. That's not good. It's probably the only time I fought like that. I learned from it. I paid the price. The biggest opportunity of my life, I blew it.\"Below is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, along with the latest odds, before we provide a prediction for the main event.\n UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavorite Underdog Weight classReinier de RIdder -198Brendan Allen +164Middleweight  Mike Malott -112 Kevin Holland -108WelterweightAiemann Zahabi -130  Marlon Vera +110BantamweightManon Fiorot -230Jasmine Jasudavicius +190Women's flyweightCody Gibson -180Aoriqileng +150BantamweightMatt Frevola -120Kyle Nelson +100Lightweight UFC Fight Night viewing information Date: Oct. 18 | Start time: 7 p.m. ET (main card) Location: Rogers Arena -- Vancouver, Canada TV channel: ESPN+ Prediction Reinier de Ridder vs. Brendan Allen: Saturday's headliners bear many similarities. They're submission specialists who stay in your face with high striking output. Neither are elite strikers nor wrestlers, and both have defensive lapses. Their finishing rates are bizarrely identical: both men have five knockout wins, two knockout losses, while Allen (14) has one more submission win than De Ridder (13). Allen is theoretically at a disadvantage fighting five rounds on short notice, but he has main event experience and doesn't struggle with cardio. This could be a very close fight, as reflected by the betting odds. De Ridder has a wider submission array, more consistency and time to prepare. He might not have the sturdiest chin, but Allen doesn't crack that hard. I see De Ridder edging out a close fight. De Ridder via Unanimous Decision\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 7 NFL schedule has several interesting quirks which could add a bit more interest to NFL picks. Patriots vs. Titans sees New England on the road for the third straight week, and the Pats, led by former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel, are 7-point favorites as they look to complete this road trip 3-0. Additionally, the Chiefs fans will get to see their team take part in a 1 p.m. ET kickoff for the only time in the first 11 weeks of the 2025 NFL season. Kansas City is an 11.5-point home favorite, the largest on the board, per the latest Week  NFL odds, as the Chiefs host the Raiders. Then, a Monday night doubleheader sees the Texans visiting the Seahawks in the nightcap at 10 p.m. ET. This is just the second time in the last 20 years that the Texans will play at Seattle, with the home team favored by 3 points. Detroit is -5.5 against the Bucs in the first Monday game. Week 7 NFL picks could account for several factors from recent performance to NFL betting trends to scheduling oddities.

Philly is coming off a mini-bye after playing last Thursday, but Minnesota is coming off a full bye after covering versus Cleveland in Week 5. Covering, or winning, isn't something that the Eagles have done recently as they're 0-2 both against the spread and straight up over their last two games. The Philly offense is in shambles as its two lowest point totals over the last calendar year have come in its two most recent contests.Since the start of last year, Minnesota has the second-best spread record overall (14-8-1), as well as the second-best spread record at home (7-3). As for the Eagles, they haven't shown a tendency to bounce back versus the line after outright defeats, which is what they're coming off with a Thursday loss to the Giants. Philadelphia is only 3-7 against the spread after a straight-up loss since the start of the 2023 season. The model has Minnesota prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 7 NFL predictions: the Broncos (-7, 40.5) cover versus the Giants in well over 50% of simulations in an A-rated pick. Bo Nix is a perfect 6-0 against the spread versus NFC opponents in his career and is also 7-1 versus the line as a home favorite. A big part of that is Denver having the most ferocious pass rush the NFL has possibly ever seen. Last year, Denver's 63 sacks were the most in the league and the second-most by any team over the last two decades. This year, Denver is on pace for an NFL record of 85 sacks which would shatter the record of 72 set by the 1984 Chicago Bears.Now, the Broncos get to face a rookie quarterback in Jaxson Dart who gets sacked at the ninth-highest rate in the league. Dart has looked impressive at home but had three turnovers in his lone road start at New Orleans, which was both a defeat and a spread loss for New York. After taking down one New York quarterback in Justin Fields nine times in Week 6, Denver is projected to take down another, in Dart, at least five times on Sunday, as the Broncos are forecasted to win by double-digits. The model also says the Over hits almost 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 7 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 7 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by nearly 70% of simulations, or more, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        Through six weeks of the NFL season, it's hard to find a team who doesn't have a serious question mark. Two weeks ago, we would've been raving about the undefeated Eagles and Bills. Now both teams have lost two straight games. How about Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, one of the preseason favorites? With Jackson having been out each of the last two weeks, Baltimore enters its bye week 1-5 and is in serious danger of missing the postseason. Even the three-time defending AFC champion Chiefs aren't immune. They sit 3-3 heading into a Week 7 home date with AFC rival Las Vegas, though Kansas City is the largest favorite of the week at -11.5 with no other team listed at more than -7.Which teams would you take today to make the Super Bowl?

The Eagles struggled mightily on defense last week, and Jalen Carter (heel) is listed as questionable for this week. \"I think it's fair to call this game a must win for Philadelphia coming off two straight losses. We've already seen one Eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit. Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well. This is the type of game where I would bet both sides +7.5 at something like -125 odds and prepare for a close game no matter who wins.

The Volunteers have been without their two top corners all season and it shows. Tennessee ranks 119th in pass defense, allowing 277 yards per game.

    "body": "\nWith the international break wrapped up, Arsenal, which sits atop the Premier League standings, is back in action on Saturday, Oct. 18, against Fulham for Matchday 8. The Gunners sit just ahead of Liverpool atop the table, and they'll look to extend their lead on Saturday. Fulham has logged eight points so far this season, which is exactly half of Arsenal's 16 to date.Kickoff from Craven Cottage in London is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. In the latest Fulham vs. Arsenal odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, the hosts are +500 on the money line (wager $100 to win $500) while the visitors are -195 favorites (wager $195 to win $100). The draw is priced at +350. The total is set at 2.5 (Over -105, Under -120). In the latest SportsLine Projection Model results, Arsenal win in 54% of simulations and the total goes Over 2.5 in 56% of simulations, good for an \"A\" grade from the model. Before locking in your bets for Fulham vs. Arsenal, you'll want to see what expert Martin Green is locking in for this match.After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer betting picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), EFL Cup (+4.47), FA Cup (+3.07) and Champions League (+3.05), among others. Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis   for Fulham vs. Arsenal on Saturday.Fulham vs. Arsenal picksArsenal to win and Under 4.5 goals (-120): 1uBukayo Saka to score or assist (-120): 0.5uArsenal will face a stern test of their title credentials when they lock horns with Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday. The Gunners surged to the top of the Premier League table after beating West Ham 2-0 earlier this month. They're on a four-game winning streak in all competitions, so they will carry a great deal of momentum into this match.However, Craven Cottage has been an unhappy hunting ground for Mikel Arteta's men in recent years. The Gunners have dropped points on their last two visits to Fulham, a 1-1 draw last season and a damaging 2-1 defeat in the 2023-24 campaign. Arsenal's players will be desperate to win this game, as it would send a message to their title rivals. It won't be easy, as Fulham are unbeaten at home this season but the Gunners should ultimately have enough firepower to get the job done.Can Arsenal clinch another symbolic win?Arsenal have earned more points than any other Premier League team over the last three seasons, but the title has eluded them. The Gunners finished second to Man City in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and then finished second to Liverpool last season. The club responded by embarking on a £250 million ($336 million) spending spree in the summer. They signed eight new players, including striker Viktor Gyökeres, holding midfielder Martin Zubimendi, playmaker Eberechi Eze and winger Noni Madueke. These players are all at the peak of their powers. The message was clear: this club is no longer building for the future. The Gunners have made a flying start to the season. They're top of the Premier League, with five wins, one draw, and one defeat from seven games. That's an impressive record, as they've already faced Man City at home and Liverpool, Man United and Newcastle on the road. They've also won both Champions League games so far and they beat Port Vale in the EFL Cup.Crucially, Arsenal have been beating teams that they tend to struggle against. In their last two league games, they secured a 2-1 away win against Newcastle and a 2-0 home victory over West Ham. Both wins were important, as they'd lost their previous three away games against Newcastle and their last two home games against the Hammers. The sportsbooks now make Arsenal the clear favorites to finally win the Premier League title this season. If the Gunners can clinch another symbolic victory over Fulham on Saturday, they will move four points clear of Liverpool at the top of the table. The stakes are high.Silva makes Fulham hard to beatFulham operate on a far tighter budget than Arsenal. The Cottagers only made one major signing this summer, bringing in Brazilian winger Kevin from Shakhtar Donetsk. They're always cautious in the transfer market, but they still have a remarkable knack of finishing mid-table each season. Fulham never seem to be genuine contenders to finish in the European places, but they're never in relegation danger either. That's largely down to the tactical prowess of manager Marco Silva. He is arguably the club's greatest asset, and he makes the Cottagers hard to beat. Fulham are currently 14th in the table with two wins, two draws, and three defeats from seven games so far. That's the sort of record we've come to expect from Silva's team. However, they're unbeaten at home with two wins and a draw. Fulham held Man United to a 1-1 draw, before beating Leeds 1-0 and Brentford 3-1 at Craven Cottage. That highlights the scale of the task facing Arsenal this weekend. The Gunners will be without their captain and creator-in-chief Martin Ødegaard. He's injured, along with Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, and Madueke. Yet Arsenal should still have enough quality to unlock this Fulham defense, with the in-form Bukayo Saka leading the charge. It could be a close game, as Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno tends to excel against Arsenal (his former club), but the Gunners should ultimately clinch a narrow victory.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a top-10 matchup in the SEC as No. 9 Georgia plays host to No. 5 Ole Miss in a game that will have major ramifications in the SEC title race as well as the College Football Playoff. It could be argued this game is something of a must-win for the Bulldogs, since they've already lost a conference game against Alabama. A second loss in SEC play would make it difficult for the Dawgs to climb to the top two and reach the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta.If that were to happen it would be the first time Georgia didn't play in the game since 2020, and only the second time in the last nine seasons.A win for Ole Miss would give the Rebels an inside track to their first ever appearance in the game. They're already 3-0 in conference play, and given what's left on their schedule, they'd have a good shot of getting through conference play with only one loss.Georgia vs. Ole Miss: Need to know  Georgia has been outscored in the first half of three of four SEC games: Slow starts are becoming the norm for the Bulldogs in conference play. They've been outscored 62-55 in the first half of their four games, and trailed at halftime against Tennessee, Georgia and Auburn. The good news for the Dawgs is they've outscored SEC teams 59-24 after halftime to overcome two of those three deficits. Still, you have to think Kirby Smart would like to see his team get off to better starts.  The Rebels are running hot against top-10 teams: Ole Miss has won three straight games against top-10 opponents, which is the second-longest streak in school history (they won four straight in 1969). That includes a win a few weeks ago against then-No. 4 LSU as well as last year's win over then No. 3 Georgia. However, the Rebels are 0-12 lifetime when facing a ranked Georgia team on the road. \nGeorgia owns October: Losing in October just isn't something the Dawgs do. They've won 17 straight October games, which is the longest October win streak in the country. Their last lost during the month was against Alabama back in the 2020 season.  Where to watch Georgia vs. Ole Miss live  Date: Saturday, Oct. 18 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Sanford Stadium -- Athens, Georgia  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)Georgia vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks  \nI don't have a great feel for this one overall. If you want to get really creative based on how trends have worked in Georgia games this year, take Ole Miss in the first half and Georgia in the third quarter. Maybe even parlay it. For a more traditional play, I'd argue taking Georgia and the points. So far in SEC play home teams have gone 14-6-1 against the spread, and Ole Miss has not had much success at Sanford Stadium. Pick: Georgia -7.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        Will No. 1 Ohio State stay perfect, or will underdog Wisconsin pull off the latest shocking upset of the 2025 season on Saturday afternoon? The Buckeyes (6-0) are back on the road for consecutive weeks, traveling to Madison as their quest to repeat as national champions rolls on. The Badgers (2-4) are guided by a familiar face, Ohio State alum and former assistant Luke Fickell, who is desperately trying to flip Wisconsin's trajectory after losing each of its last nine games against Power Four opponents.Even with his seat heating up, owning a 15-17 overall record and 8-13 against Big Ten opponents, Fickell isn't worried about the optics of potentially his final game on the Badgers' sideline coming against his former school.Bet Wisconsin vs. Ohio State at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:\"For me to sit here and worry about all those other things, there's not enough time in the day, there's not enough energy in the day,\" Fickell said Monday. \"So, the focus for me and for our staff is on the guys inside that locker room and doing everything we can to make sure that we keep that thing rolling.\"\nWhether that's enough to quiet the noise around his future remains to be seen. But with Ohio State on deck, Fickell's words will be put to the test Saturday on CBS.  Ohio State vs. Wisconsin: Need to know  First-half fortress: The Buckeyes have yet to allow a touchdown in the first half through six games this season -- the only team in the FBS to hold that distinction. In fact, opponents have reached the red zone just six times before halftime against Ohio State, a testament to how dominant the defense has been out of the gate. That's a troubling matchup for Wisconsin, which has just 12 total red zone trips all season -- tied for the fewest among Power Four teams and fifth-fewest in the FBS.Big Ten blues: Wisconsin has lost eight consecutive Big Ten games dating back to last season. It's the Badgers' longest winless stretch against conference opponents since a 19-game slide spanning 1989 to 1991. Meanwhile, Ohio State coach Ryan Day is 47-0 against Big Ten opponents not named Michigan or Oregon since 2019.\nWho starts at QB for Wisconsin?: Fickell was noncommittal about his starter with Ohio State up next. Billy Edwards Jr.'s status remains uncertain after re-aggravating an injury against Maryland in Week 4. Hunter Simmons, a Southern Illinois transfer, has started the past two games but completed only 52% of his passes with three interceptions and no touchdowns. Freshman Danny O'Neil, who filled in earlier this season, threw five picks in four appearances. The Badgers' 6:8 passing touchdown-to-interception ratio ranks seventh-worst in the FBS.

Ohio State is 5-1 ATS this season -- surprisingly, the lone miss came against Ohio in Week 3. The trajectories of these programs couldn't be more different. Ohio State continues to roll under Ryan Day, while Wisconsin is searching for answers under Luke Fickell as the losses -- and questions -- pile up. Historically, the trends might suggest leaning toward Wisconsin, with Day owning a 14-13 ATS record in Big Ten road games since 2019. But that edge disappears when considering Fickell's 3-7 ATS mark at home in conference play since 2022. Pick: Ohio State -26.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        No. 7 Texas Tech travels to face Arizona State in one of the biggest games of the season for the program. The Red Raiders have been tremendously dominant in the early season, winning games by an average of 35.3 points per game. In a 42-17 decimation of Kansas, Texas Tech posted 372 yards and four touchdowns on the ground, including 263 from running back Cameron Dickey. Arizona State is the reigning Big 12 champ, but have two losses by October for the second straight year. With quarterback Sam Leavitt sidelined, the Sun Devils were obliterated 42-10 against Utah. Backup quarterback Jeff Sims connected on only 18 of 38 passes. Texas Tech and Arizona State have only played five times in program history, with all matchups coming since 1999. Last season, the Red Raiders outlasted Arizona State 30-22. Red Raiders quarterback Behren Morton threw for 201 yards and two touchdowns.    Texas Tech vs. Arizona State: Need to know  Freaky defense: Texas Tech invested heavily on the defensive line over the offseason, and it's delivered sensational results. The Red Raiders rank in the top 5 nationally in both tackles for loss and sacks, and have controlled games. Linebacker David Bailey was a midseason All-American after leading the nation with 8.5 sacks, including three against the Jayhawks. Arizona State will have a major battle dealing with him. One-man show: Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson has been one of the best in the country, ranking No. 2 in receiving yards among Big 12 players with 523 and seven touchdowns. Hwoever, the rest of the receiving corps has largely been a nonfactor. No other wide receiver has more than 105 yards, and 61 of Derek Eusobio's came on one play. The second and third receiver are a tight end and running back. Against a stacked Texas Tech defense, the Sun Devils need more players to spread the field. \nHealth issues: Both quarterbacks heading into this game have health concerns and missed time last week. Sam Leavitt is working through a lower body injury and remains questionable. Behren Morton is still working back, but is expected to play for the Red Raiders. However, Texas Tech feels far better about its backup situation as Will Hammond has shown real signs in relief. Jeff Sims has given the Sun Devils very little.   Where to watch Texas Tech vs. Arizona State live  Date: Saturday, Oct. 18 | Time: 4 p.m. ET  Location: Mountain America Stadium -- Tempe, Arizona  TV: FOX | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)  Texas Tech vs. Arizona State prediction, picks  \nThe Red Raiders have been nearly unbeatable through six games, physically bullying their opponents into submission with their aggressive pass rush. The Sun Devils had real optimism coming into the year, but the injury to quarterback Sam Leavitt has left a major hole. The Red Raiders will need to get another strong game from their running backs, but Arizona State simply can't hang, even at home. Pick: Texas Tech -9.5\n\n                    \n    \n

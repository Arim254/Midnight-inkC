    "body": "\n        One of the last big boxing events of the year is upon us. All eyes are on Miami as Jake Paul takes on his literal biggest test yet when he steps in the ring with former unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. It all goes down on Friday night at the Kaseya Center and can be streamed live on Netflix.Paul has become one of boxing's biggest stars through careful matchmaking, expert promotion, world class training and solid athleticism. Over the last five years he's accumulated a 12-1 record by beating former UFC champions and stars with little boxing experience, smaller foes, and a nearly 60-year-old Mike Tyson.Joshua, meanwhile, is one of the sport's most decorated champions of his era. He earned gold at the 2012 Olympics before turning pro and earning the unified heavyweight titles. While he has yet to secure the desired matchups against Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder, Joshua did have two chances against Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed crown, but came up short in both instances.\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"\nBet Paul vs. Joshua at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Netflix's boxing return also features a clash of ex-mixed martial arts champions. Former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva boxes former welterweight champion Tyron Woodley in a six-round cruiserweight affair. The card also features three boxing title fights, including one for the undisputed women's bantamweight crown.\"The motivation is passion and love,\" Silva said at the final press conference. \"And I have my biggest idol [Roy Jones] here in front of me. I remember when I was watching Mr. Roy Jones fighting in the Olympic Games, I just looked and said, 'Whoa, one day I will become a champion the same as this man.'

Adaway's attorney, B. Keith Jackson, said to The Washington Post that the Gamecocks running back filed a complaint on Dec. 12 accusing the trooper of assault. The Brazos County (Texas) District Attorney is considering whether to move forward with charges.Adaway's attempts to learn the trooper's name have come up short. Neither Texas A&M Police nor the Texas Department of Public Safety declined to provide identification, even after Adaway called campus police to report an assault. Adaway said he wants to know the trooper's name and to receive an apology.In the month since the game, Adaway said he has lost sleep over the incident and has seen a University of South Carolina sports psychiatrist because of the emotional distress.\"You see this sort of thing on TV -- different scenarios of police bullying people here and there -- but you never feel it and understand it until you're actually in the situation,\" Adaway said to the Washington Post.The incident occurred in the final minute of the second quarter after Harbor scored an 80-yard touchdown. Harbor ran through the end zone and partway up a tunnel while holding the back of his right leg in apparent discomfort. Multiple teammates, including Adaway, followed him into the tunnel and walked with him back toward the field. As they exited from the tunnel, the trooper walked the opposite direction, bumped into them and turned around to point at and say something to them.\nReactions to the incident poured in throughout the sports world. LeBron James was among the numerous prominent figures to comment on the situation.The Texas DPS relieved the officer of his game-day duties and sent him home after the incident.\"The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is aware of the incident that occurred today during the Texas A&M football game,\" the DPS said in a statement. \"The DPS Trooper involved was sent home from the game. Our Office of Inspector General (OIG) is also aware of the incident and will be further looking into the matter. No additional information will be released at this time.\"\nThe touchdown that preceded the incident gave South Carolina a stunning 27-3 lead over Texas A&M. The Gamecocks eventually extended their advantage to 30-3 before the Aggies rallied back for the largest comeback in program history, erasing a 27-point deficit for a 31-30 victory to remain undefeated at the time.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        One of the offseason's top free-agent starters is heading back to San Diego. Right-hander Michael King and the Padres have agreed to a three-year contract worth $75 million, reports MLB.com. King can opt out after 2026 and 2027. The team has not yet announced the signing. Here's the salary breakdown:2026: $5M salary and $12 million signing bonus2027: $28 million salary ($5 million buyout if opt out is used)2028: $30 million salary (no buyout if opt out is used)King, 30, spent the last two years with the Padres after coming over from the New York Yankees in the Juan Soto trade. In 2024, King struck out 201 batters and had a 2.95 ERA in 173 ⅔ innings, which earned him a seventh place finish in the Cy Young voting. Shoulder and knee injuries limited him to 73 ⅓ innings with a 3.44 ERA in 2025. We ranked King as the 17th-best free agent available this offseason, and the sixth-best free-agent starting pitcher. Here's the write-up: The book on King hasn't changed much over the years, even if his role  has shifted this way and that a few times. He has a quality arsenal  built on horizontal movement, and an undeniable track record of being a  plus performer. Unfortunately, he's a high injury risk who has topped 75  innings twice to date. There's no harm rolling the dice, but one should  be realistic about the expected outcome.  \tKing is something of the ideal modern pitcher, one with an extreme east/west pitching attack (i.e. sinkers and sweepers) but also an analytics-friendly four-seam fastball. He also has plenty of experience as both a starter and reliever, including as a multi-inning setup man familiar with high-leverage situations. Come postseason time, King has the versatility to help his team in any capacity. \nThe Padres made King the $22.025 million qualifying offer last month, which he rejected. They will neither gain nor forfeit a draft pick to re-sign him. Being attached to draft pick compensation may have hurt King's market, leading to him taking what amounts to a one-year contract with insurance policies for 2027 and 2028.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Fans who have been waiting for Jake Paul's boxing career to come crashing down may get their wish on Friday night when the social media influencer-turned-boxer faces the biggest test of his career in the form of two-time unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua (Netflix, 8 p.m. ET).Paul's career started off as little more than a sideshow, stopping fellow influencer KSI in a white-collar exhibition before knocking out another influencer, AnEsonGib, in his pro debut. Paul's second pro fight saw him score a viral knockout of former NBA star Nate Robinson on the undercard of the highly-watched event headlined by an exhibition between Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr.Paul then turned to facing a series of former UFC fighters, defeating Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Anderson Silva. Silva was the only of Paul's first five opponents who had any professional boxing experience, leading to calls for Paul to \"face a real boxer.\"Paul did just that in his seventh pro fight, and it resulted in his first loss as Tommy Fury took a split decision win in a fight that saw Paul score a knockdown but ultimately fail to be active enough to win over two of the three ringside judges.\n\n        \n            \n                Jake Paul faces his toughest test to date as he makes a calculated business decision against Anthony Joshua\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter defeating former UFC star Nate Diaz, Paul scored back-to-back knockouts over club-level fighters before stopping another former UFC fighter and current BKFC star, Mike Perry.Paul then faced 57-year-old Mike Tyson in a shameless fight that saw Tyson unable to do much of anything while Paul carried the fight to the judges' scorecards. Another win over an aging former world champion followed as Paul took a decision win over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.Looking at that resume, you can see a pattern of Paul facing almost exclusively smaller, older and/or completely inexperienced boxers.\nThat will not be the case on Friday, when Paul faces a much larger man in the 6-foot-6 Joshua, a 2012 Olympic gold medalist and two-time unified heavyweight champion of the world.\"Yeah, 100%. This is the Giants vs the Patriots 2007. I mean, the list goes on, but the odds are stacked against me,\" Paul said at the final press conference. \"There's no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it's this big of a difference in terms of skill, experience, resume, height, weight, etc. So this is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sports and you guys get to witness it.\"While Joshua is past his absolute prime, he is not so far removed as to not be capable of competing with the best heavyweights in the world.\nAfter a 15-0 start to his pro career, Joshua knocked out Charles Martin to capture the IBF heavyweight championship. After two successful defenses of the title, Joshua stopped Wladimir Klitschko to add the WBA belt to his collection. Two fights later, Joshua would grab a third belt, stopping Joseph Parker for the WBO title.The Parker fight, the 21st of Joshua's career, was the first time a Joshua opponent made it to the final bell.In June 2019, Joshua suffered a shocking TKO loss to Andy Ruiz Jr., losing his status as unified champion in the process. The Ruiz upset was one of the biggest in heavyweight boxing history -- something Paul fans use as proof that Joshua is a vulnerable fighter, even when heavily favored.\nJoshua got his revenge in a rematch with Ruiz, regaining his three world titles. After a single defense, Joshua finally met a fighter who was clearly his superior, losing a September 2021 fight to Oleksandr Usyk and dropping the rematch the following August.Joshua has won four of his five fights since the Usyk bouts, including a thunderous knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, before suffering a brutal knockout loss in an IBF title fight with Daniel Dubois.While no longer among the elite of the elite, Joshua remains a talented, strong, and large heavyweight and is a fighter unlike any Paul has shared the ring.\n\"Jake Paul creates a great challenge for me, and he's got a great mindset for sure,\" Joshua said. \"Great family, great brother, great person. So yeah, he definitely creates a good challenge for me. But as I said earlier, competition is really good.\"Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Joshua vs. Paul fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookAnthony Joshua -1200 vs. Jake Paul +700, heavyweightsAlycia Baumgardner (c) -1400 vs. Leila Beaudoin +750, unified junior lightweight titleAnderson Silva -275 vs. Tyron Woodley +210, cruiserweightsJahmal Harvey -3500 vs. Kevin Cervantes +1300, junior lightweightsCherneka Johnson (c) -900 vs. Amanda Galle +550, undisputed bantamweight titleCaroline Dubois (c) -3500 vs. Camila Panatta +1300, WBC lightweight titleYokasta Valle (c) -1400 vs. Yadira Bustillos +700 . WBC strawweight titleAvious Griffin -600 vs. Justin Cardona +400, welterweightsKeno Marley -10000 vs. Diarra Davis Jr. +1800, cruiserweightsWhere to watch Jake Paul vs. Anthony JoshuaDate: Dec. 19Location: Kaseya Center -- MiamiStart time: 8 p.m. ET (Main card) How to watch: Netflix (subscription required)PredictionLook, what is there to say? If Jake Paul wins, it would be legitimately shocking. It would be a sport-shaking result -- and one many would refuse to accept as legitimate, no matter how little sense a fix would make. Joshua is bigger, stronger, more technical, has more power and high-level experience against some of the best fighters in the world. Paul has ... fought some guys people know who have all come into the fight with at least some degree of disadvantage.\nAnthony Joshua wins this fight 99 times out of 100. Paul's best trait is his power, and landing one big shot and knocking out Joshua is the way Paul wins that one fight out of 100. It's just very unlikely, and Paul's worst defensive traits, such as hanging around the ropes while not throwing punches, leaves him open to Joshua's power and sharp punching. In reality, every round Paul survives is a win in its own way.

    "body": "\n        The Ohio Bobcats fired first-year coach Brian Smith for cause, the program announced Wednesday after earlier this month placing him on leave for an \"undetermined period of time\" and naming defensive coordinator John Hauser as interim coach. Ohio University previously did not disclose details as to why it placed Smith on leave, and after his firing, it cited \"serious professional misconduct\" without specifying the exact behavior that led to his ouster. The intent to terminate letter, however, outlines Smith's alleged \"extramarital affairs\" -- including one with a graduate student -- and accused him of consuming alcohol on the job.University president Lori Stewart Gonzalez said in the letter that Smith brought \"disrepute, scandal and ridicule\" to the school for carrying on an affair at the Ohio University Inn. Gonzalez also said that the school was aware of Smith's consuming of alcohol in his office as well as his smelling strongly of alcohol and appearing intoxicated at a public appearance.\"The termination follows an administrative review of allegations that Smith violated the terms of his employment agreement by engaging in serious professional misconduct and participating in activities that reflect unfavorably on the University,\" the school said in a statement.Hauser will coach the Bobcats in their bowl game against UNLV on Dec. 23 and run the program until a new hire is made.\nSmith's attorney, Rex Elliott, disputes Ohio's reasoning for the dismissal.\"We vigorously dispute Ohio University's grounds for the termination for cause of Coach Brian Smith,\" Elliott said in a statement provided to CBS Sports' Richard Johnson. \"He is shocked and dismayed by this turn of events, and we plan to fight this wrongful termination to protect his good name. Coach Smith is an ethical man who has done an exemplary job for the University. He wants nothing but the best for the players, coaches, and the entire Bobcat community.\"Smith was named the interim coach last year when Tim Albin left to take the Charlotte job. Albin led Ohio to its first Mid-American Conference title since 1968 but departed prior to the Cure Bowl. Smith then was promoted to full-time head coach. Before arriving at Ohio in 2022, Smith was the offensive coordinator at Hawaii, his alma mater, and Washington State. \nHauser has spent most of his career coaching in the MAC, with time at Northern Illinois and Miami (OH) before joining the Bobcats' staff in 2022. He's risen from safeties coach to defensive coordinator and associate head coach, and now gets a crack at the interim head coaching position. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThere's nothing like a good hot streak in December when it comes to picking NFL games. For me, it's been a bit of a heater.I went 11-5 both straight up and against the spread last week, which has me feeling optimistic heading down the stretch of the regular season.For the season, I am now 117-106-1 ATS and 151-72-1 straight up. To be 11 games over .500 picking every game each week is quite a feat, if I don't say so myself.Let's hope as the weather gets frigid around the country, I can stay as hot as a July day at the beach.All Week 16 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Philadelphia Eagles (-7) at Washington CommandersSaturday, 5 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles got back on track last week against the Raiders, while the Commanders won the road against the Giants. But this is a big step up for a Commanders team that has had defensive issues all year long. This rematch of the NFC Championship game goes to the Eagles just like that one did. Philly wins it. Pick: Eagles 32, Commanders 17Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (-1.5)Saturday, 8:20 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Packers are reeling after losing to Denver and losing key players, including star edge Micah Parsons for the year with a torn ACL. They beat the Bears two weeks ago at home, but this is a bigger challenge on the road. Chicago is playing well and that offense against the Parsons-less defense will be a lot to handle. But I think Jordan Love comes up big.Pick: Packers 27, Bears 24Buffalo Bills (-10.5) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Bills are coming off a big road victory over the Patriots and now play a second-consecutive road game against a team they should beat. Motivation could be key, but the Browns have offensive issues. Look for the Bills to take care of things in this one early to win it behind another strong game by Josh Allen. Pick: Bills 27, Browns 14Cincinnati Bengals (-4.5) at Miami DolphinsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Bengals were shut out by the Ravens last week and eliminated from playoff contention, while Miami lost to the Steelers Monday night to also be eliminated. So this game means nothing. With that as a backdrop, give me Miami at home. De'Von Achane will run it wild and have a big day. Pick: Dolphins 30, Bengals 26Kansas City Chiefs (-3) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Chiefs have been eliminated from the playoffs and Patrick Mahomes is lost for the season. How focused will they be here? Does it matter. The Titans are bad and Gardner Minshew is more than capable of having a solid game. Chiefs win it. Pick: Chiefs 24, Titans 17Los Angeles Chargers at Dallas Cowboys (-2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Chargers have won two straight, while the Cowboys have lost two straight. Dallas is barely alive in the playoff race, and could be eliminated Saturday night if the Eagles win, while the Chargers are surging. But after beating the Chiefs last week, this could be a letdown spot for the Chargers. Dallas can score and I think they will here. Cowboys take it. Pick: Cowboys 33, Chargers 27Minnesota Vikings (-3) at New York GiantsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Vikings are playing consecutive road games, but they played well at Dallas. The Giants didn't look good in the home loss to the Commanders last week. But I think they bounce back here and the defense plays better against J.J. McCarthy. The Giants win it at home. Pick: Giants 24, Vikings 20New York Jets at New Orleans Saints (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jets are out on the road for the second straight week, which is never an easy thing for a bad team playing for nothing. The Saints have showed some fight the past month, which I think continues in this one. Tyler Shough has played well and the Jets have little in terms of offense. Saints win it.Pick: Saints 27, Jets 10Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-3) at Carolina PanthersSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is for first place in the division. Both teams are coming off bad losses that have them at 7-7 and tied for the division lead. The Bucs have not played well on defense as of late, but the Carolina offense isn't great. Look for Baker Mayfield and the Bucs offense to get the best of the Carolina defense, while Bryce Young can't keep up. Pick: Buccaneers 23, Panthers 19Atlanta Falcons (-3) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThese two are among the biggest disappointments of the year. The Cardinals are decimated by injuries, which shows up on defense. The Falcons showed they could score against Tampa Bay with Kirk Cousins at quarterback and that will continue in this one. Falcons win it. Pick: Falcons 34, Cardinals 23Jacksonville Jaguars at Denver Broncos (-3)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is the one of the games of the week, featuring the top-seed Broncos against the third-seeded Jaguars. Both teams are playing much better on offense as of late, which could make this fun to watch. This a big proving game for the young Jaguars and I think they can come in and win it with a big day from Trevor Lawrence. Pick: Jaguars 27, Broncos 26Las Vegas Raiders at Houston Texans (-14.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+) \nThe Raiders are bad right now with little semblance of an offense, while the Texans are the best defense in the league. That's a bad combination. The Raiders are also playing consecutive road games with no chance for the playoffs, while the Texans would be in the postseason right now and need it. Texans in a blowout. Pick: Texans 31, Raiders 9Pittsburgh Steelers at Detroit Lions (-7)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a big game for both in their playoff quest. The Lions lost last week, while the Steelers are coming off a Monday night win over the Dolphins. The Steelers defense played well in that one, but this is a big step up in terms of matching offensive firepower. Both teams will score, but the Lions will get more.Pick: Lions 33, Steelers 27New England Patriots at Baltimore Ravens (-3)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC\nThe Patriots are coming off a tough loss at home against the Bills and now must head out to play a Ravens team that shut out the Bengals last week. The Ravens are also more desperate in the playoff race, which matters. Lamar Jackson wins it as the Patriots drop their second straight. Pick: Ravens 30, Patriots 26San Francisco 49ers (-6) at Indianapolis ColtsMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis will be the second start for Philip Rivers for the Colts after he almost won at Seattle last week. The 49ers are 10-4 and pushing for a playoff spot. They blew out Tennessee last week, but the defense wasn't great. It won't matter as the 49ers will limit Rivers and Brock Purdy will play well. The 49ers keep on winning.Pick: 49ers 27, Colts 23\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 15 in the NFL was a rough week for many. Not only did we see several stars go down with injuries, such as Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons and Davante Adams, but we also witnessed a couple of notable teams be eliminated from playoff contention, such as the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals.Week 16 features some incredible matchups, as the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears face off for the second time in three weeks, the fate of the NFC South is on the line with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Carolina Panthers, and the New England Patriots look to rebound from their loss to the Buffalo Bills against Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. Which teams should you pick this weekend, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these matchups are as of Thursday morning at DraftKings Sportsbook. \nGreen Bay Packers (-1.5) at Chicago Bears (Saturday)\nDajani (Bears +1.5): Caleb Williams was one good throw away from making the first matchup vs. Green Bay a lot more interesting. I think he will learn from that experience. Plus, this Bears team is riding high following a 31-3 dismantling of the lowly Cleveland Browns. It was the Bears' largest win in five years, and the defense forced three turnovers. That makes it now 30 takeaways for Chicago on the year, which of course leads the NFL.The Packers, on the other hand, are ... not riding high. Not only did they collapse down the stretch in Denver, but Micah Parsons is also done for the year with a torn ACL. I think the Bears take it. Prediction: Bears 23, Packers 17Dubin (Packers -1.5): This line is begging everyone to take the Bears after the way the game went two weeks ago and the injuries to Micah Parsons and Christian Watson, and I'm just not comfortable with it. It feels like a trap. I think the Packers can still move the ball on Chicago here, and that the defense can hang on without Parsons, even if it won't be the truly elite unit that he can turn it into. Prediction: Packers 23, Bears 20\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 Power Rankings: Two plays may have just changed the Packers' season and the NFC playoff race\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTampa Bay Buccaneers (-3) at Carolina Panthers\nDajani (Buccaneers -3): You never know what you're going to get with the Panthers. Bryce Young could throw for 400 yards in an upset victory or look completely helpless. The Buccaneers are on a horrific skid, having lost five out of their past six games.However, I'm going to take Tampa Bay here for two reasons: One, I think the Bucs are simply the better team. Carolina has a -3.8 points per game differential this season, which ranks worst in the NFL among teams .500 or better. Plus, this Carolina defense just allowed the New Orleans Saints to rack up 337 yards and struggled to get Tyler Shough and Co. off the field. Two, Baker Mayfield has his full cast of playmakers back with Bucky Irving, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Jalen McMillan. Prediction: Buccaneers 26, Panthers 20Dubin (Buccaneers -3): I'm riding with the Bucs for mostly the same reasons as Dajani. I trust Tampa's offense more with the reintroduction of Baker Mayfield's playmakers. The Panthers can run the ball decently, but nobody really runs it on the Bucs. You have to beat them through the air. And I just don't think Bryce Young is consistent enough for me to bet on that happening. Prediction: Buccaneers 24, Panthers 17\nLos Angeles Chargers at Dallas Cowboys (-2.5)\nDajani (Chargers +2.5): The Cowboys printed money for several weeks, including when they upset the Philadelphia Eagles and Chiefs in the span of five days. Then, they were blown out by the Detroit Lions and upset by J.J. McCarthy and the Vikings. It's tough to gauge where this team is with their backs up against the wall, especially with them facing a stout Chargers team. L.A. is actually allowing just 242.3 total yards per game and 17.3 points per game during this 6-1 stretch. Give me the underdog. Prediction: Chargers 30, Cowboys 24Dubin (Chargers +2.5): Why exactly is Dallas favored here? The defense has taken a significant step backward since that first game post-trade deadline against the Raiders. It's basically the same unit it was before the deadline. The offense can obviously move the ball against pretty much anyone, but the Chargers aren't just anyone. As Dajani mentioned, they're shutting down just about everybody in recent weeks. Prediction: Chargers 27, Cowboys 23\nJacksonville Jaguars at Denver Broncos (-3)\nDajani (Jaguars +3): The most underrated storyline in the NFL over the past couple weeks has been the reemergence of Trevor Lawrence. He accounted for 381 total yards and six touchdowns against the New York Jets last week, and before you say, \"So? It was the Jets,\" I thought Lawrence played one of his best games of the season the week prior against the Indianapolis Colts in a rainstorm. He's playing with confidence and has found a rhythm when it comes to throwing the ball down the field.\nJakobi Meyers has been a big part of this turnaround, as Lawrence actually leads the NFL in yards per attempt since Jacksonville made that trade. I mean, the Jaguars are averaging 33.3 points per contest in the six games since the trade deadline. That ranks second in the NFL behind the mighty Rams. The elite Broncos defense hasn't allowed many quarterbacks to look good this season, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say the Broncos' 11-game win streak ends this week. Prediction: Jaguars 27, Broncos 23Dubin (Broncos -3): I'm very excited to see whether Trevor Lawrence can keep up his recent run of production, against a quality defense. I've been reluctant to buy into the Broncos all year and they just keep proving me wrong by winning games in spots I expect them to lose. Now that I'm finally in, they'll probably prove me wrong again and lose here. Especially because I've also been reluctant to buy in on the Jaguars and am remaining so here because of concerns that this run they've been on has mostly come against some poor opponents. Prediction: Broncos 20, Jaguars 16Pittsburgh Steelers at Detroit Lions (-7)\nDajani (Lions -7): The Steelers are feeling good following their blowout victory over the Miami Dolphins, but good luck outscoring the Lions. This unit leads the NFL with 30.6 points per game and averages 91.8 more yards per game than Pittsburgh. Aaron Rodgers' offense ranks last in the NFL in time of possession (27:26) and offensive plays run per game (55.7). \nMeanwhile, this Steelers pass defense ranks bottom six in the NFL, so Jared Goff could have a field day. The Lions are desperate for a win, as they would be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss. Prediction: Lions 30, Steelers 20Dubin (Lions -7): I feel the same way about this game as Dajani does. I just don't think the Steelers can score enough to keep up with the Lions -- even against an injury-ravaged Detroit defense. You can run on the Steelers, as we have seen in recent weeks, and this feels like a game where Jahmyr Gibbs gets back on track in a big way after he struggled to run the ball against the Rams last week. Unless an offensive explosion comes out of nowhere for Pittsburgh, I like the Lions to win big. Prediction: Lions 31, Steelers 17\nNew England Patriots at Baltimore Ravens (-3) (SNF)\nDajani (Patriots +3): I wasn't incredibly impressed by the Ravens' win over the hapless Bengals. Sad boy Joe Burrow played the second-worst game of his NFL career in front of his home fans as he potentially mulls either retirement or a trade request. \nWhile the Patriots blew a 21-0 lead to Buffalo, it was about time they found the loss column. It had been almost three months since their last loss, and now they have the opportunity to reset, refocus and rebound. The Patriots are 6-1 SU and ATS in their last seven road games, while Drake Maye is 3-0 SU and ATS in prime-time games. On the flip side, the Ravens are 5-9 ATS on the year, which is tied for the worst mark in the NFL. Prediction: Patriots 28, Ravens 21Dubin (Ravens -3): I'm sort of wondering why the Ravens are even favored in this game considering the context of these two teams' seasons, and that has me thinking Vegas knows something about the matchup that we don't. Baltimore's defense has played better since recovering from the early-season injuries, and it may be tough for Drake Maye and Co. to have a huge game here. Couple that with New England's own backslide against the run defensively, and I'm going with what I think is maybe an upset but the fine folks at DraftKings apparently do not. Prediction: Ravens 24, Patriots 20San Francisco 49ers (-6) at Indianapolis Colts (MNF)\nDajani (49ers -6): Grandpa Rivers did a pretty solid job in his return to the field last week against Seattle. It's almost embarrassing that the Seahawks needed a game-winning field goal to win. I imagine Lucas Oil Stadium is going to be rocking for this prime-time matchup, but the difference in this game is going to be the 49ers offense vs. the Colts defense.\nThe versatile Christian McCaffrey has been one of the best players in the entire NFL this season, George Kittle has crossed 65 yards receiving in five straight games, Jauan Jennings caught two touchdowns last week and Brock Purdy has found a rhythm. With the number under a touchdown, I have to roll with the 49ers. Prediction: 49ers 24, Colts 16Dubin (49ers -6): Count me among those that did not actually think that Philip Rivers' return to the field was at all impressive. He looked like a 44-year-old grandfather who can't really throw the ball. Seemingly everyone can throw on the 49ers, so maybe he gets going here, but I doubt it. On the other side of the ball, I think San Francisco can get something going against the Indianapolis defense. Even potentially without Ricky Pearsall, there are just too many weapons for them to get shut down, especially if Sauce Gardner is not going to be out there. Prediction: 49ers 27, Colts 16\n            ",

    "body": "\nA divisional battle takes place on 'Thursday Night Football' as the Seattle Seahawks host the Los Angeles Rams at 8:15 p.m. ET. Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) missed practice on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving him doubtful for tonight. With Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Puka Nacua ranking first and second, respectively, in receiving yards, NFL DFS stacks with their respective quarterbacks will be a popular daily Fantasy football strategy. However, Sam Darnold had four picks when these teams met in Week 11, while Matthew Stafford had just 130 passing yards. So, your NFL DFS strategy shouldn't bypass the ground games as both squads use multiple running backs.  Potential NFL DFS picks out of the backfield include Kenneth Walker III, Zach Charbonnet, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. It's all about getting the most value relative to cost when choosing options from the TNF DFS player pool. The weather forecasts call for an 87% chance of rain with wind gusts of 35 m.p.h., which could affect your NFL DFS strategy. Before making any Rams vs. Seahawks DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Thursday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Seahawks vs. RamsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football' is Rams wideout Puka Nacua. Despite missing one full game, and half of another, Nacua is second in the NFL in both receptions (102) and receiving yards (1,367). The third-year receiver is coming off his best game as a pro with a career high of 181 yards on Sunday versus Detroit, which came just a week after posting a 7-167-2 stat line. Nacua had 93 total yards versus Seattle in their matchup earlier this year.. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Nacua to go Over 7.5 receptions at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Seahawks tight end AJ Barner, who was heavily featured in Week 11 versus the Rams. He had season highs in targets (11) and receptions (10), while his 70 receiving yards were one shy of matching his career high of 71. For the season, Barner has scored 5 touchdowns as part of his 43 catches and 413 receiving yards. With the Rams having a top-10 run defense, and allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns of any team, as opposed to the No. 19 pass defense, Seattle could lean on an aerial attack. That boosts Barner's value, who also scored a touchdown in his last game versus the Rams in the 2024 season. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Barner to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Rams vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\nFormer NASCAR driver Greg Biffle was among the several people killed Thursday in a plane crash at Statesville Regional Airport in North Carolina. NASCAR confirmed that three of Biffle's family members were also killed in the tragic accident. His wife Cristina, daughter Emma and son Ryder were among the victims. Dennis Dutton, his son Jack and Craig Wadsworth also died in the crash.The plane, which crashed during a landing at approximately 10:15 a.m., was registered to a company that Biffle owned.Flight tracking data shows the plane took off from the airport around 10 a.m. but returned and attempted to land at the Charlotte-area airport. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed that six people were aboard the Cessna C550 and that there were fatalities associated with the crash.\"NASCAR is devastated by the tragic loss of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, son Ryder, Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton in a fatal plane crash,\" NASCAR said in a statement. \"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many. His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.\"On the track, Greg's talent and tenacity earned him championships in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series, as well as numerous wins and accolades in the NASCAR Cup Series. Beyond his racing career, he gave of himself for the betterment of our community. Most notably, Greg spent countless hours of his time helping the citizens of North Carolina during the disasters that followed Hurricane Helene. His tireless work saved lives. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to Greg's entire family, friends, and all who were touched by his life.\"In the years following his exit from racing, Biffle was involved in humanitarian efforts in North Carolina and headlined the many NASCAR figures to assist in 2024 with Hurricane Helene recovery. Biffle flew a private helicopter into the affected region of Western North Carolina to deliver supplies and internet service to those stranded.\"It's heartbreaking,\" North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a press conference. \"Just heartbreaking. I just learned about it 20-30 minutes ago. I don't know that we know the number of casualties. Obviously a number of people were impacted. Our hearts go out to those families. No more tragic way to walk into the holiday season.\"Biffle, 55, drove in 515 races over a 16-year NASCAR Cup Series career. He racked up 19 wins and 175 top-10 finishes. He competed numerous times for the Cup Series championship. His best series finish came in 2005 when he finished second behind Tony Stewart.Biffle won numerous awards throughout his prolific career and in 2023 was named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest Drivers. He won the 2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and the 2002 NASCAR Busch Series. He was the first of only three drivers to win both competitions. He was also one of 36 drivers to win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jake Paul isn't taking many shortcuts against Anthony Joshua. The two are set to throw down on Friday after Paul moved on from his original opponent, Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis, Paul vs. Joshua is a professional boxing match, unlike the exhibition fight that Paul was previously working towards. This means the result will impact their pro records. Paul (12-1, 6 KOs) and Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) will wear the standard 10-ounce gloves used by heavyweights. Paul has competed in 10-ounce gloves for most of his career, excluding the unusual 14-ounce gloves used for his fight with \"Iron\" Mike Tyson. Against Davis, Paul was planning to wear 12-ounce gloves.  The fight will be contested at heavyweight, stripping Paul of his normal weight advantage against opponents. Paul normally competes at cruiserweight, 65 pounds higher than WBA champion Davis' usual weight class. Paul's only previous heavyweight fight was against Tyson, who was 30 years older than Paul. However, there is a stipulation that says Joshua cannot weigh more than 245 pounds for the bout.\n\n        \n            \n                Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua fight predictions, undercard, odds, start time for showdown in Miami\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"People don't like the fact that I'm fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. But if we look at the people that don't want me to be here, but they want me to put an end to Jake Paul's show, I understand it and that's why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.\"Perhaps the only stipulation benefiting Paul is the round totals. Joshua has exclusively competed in 12-round fights for the last decade, excluding a 10-round maximum for his short fight with Francis Ngannou. His fight with Paul is scheduled for eight three-minute rounds. With many believing Joshua will knock out Paul, this reduces the time Paul must theoretically survive.\nPaul is preparing for undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career. The crossover star made a career by seeking opponents whose name value greatly outweighed their boxing experience, or who were significantly older or smaller than him. Though Joshua is 36 and likely beyond his prime, he should possess everything necessary to make short work of his opponent. Joshua is a two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist. Last year, he knocked out former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou in two rounds after Ngannou took Tyson Fury to a split decision.Paul vs. Joshua takes place on Saturday inside Miami's Kaseya Center.Who wins Anthony Joshua vs. Jake Paul on Dec. 19, and which massive longshot prop should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Friday, Dec. 19, heavyweight bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the majority of Fantasy Football leagues, over half of the league is done playing after Week 15. In redraft, that thought leads to only sadness. In Dynasty, it just means more Dynasty minds looking to the future. As I begin the process of working on my 2026 Dynasty rankings, which will be released on January 1st, I thought it might be helpful to look at some future risers and fallers in these rankings and in the trade charts.The first obvious risers will be the injured players. This is why we suggest rebuilders targeting young injured players in trades. I anticipate Cam Skattebo, Malik Nabers, Travis Hunter, Garrett Wilson, and Sam Laporta all ranking higher in January than they do right now. Guys like Tyreek Hill, Patrick Mahomes, Kyler Murray, and Daniel Jones may have to wait a few months as we get clarity on their 2026 status. There is a good chance Rashee Rice's rise is tied to Mahomes' health and the Chiefs offseason.Non-injury risers are harder to predict, but don't be surprised if Trevor Lawrence, Breece Hall, Omarion Hampton, and Michael Pittman get a boost. Luther Burden will be a fascinating case to watch this offseason. I could see a playoff performance for him that sends his value skyrocketing once his ankle injury is healed.\nThis week, we had Brian Simpson from QB List on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty. We talked about the best of the best at each position, including Josh Allen, Jahmyr Gibbs, Ja'Marr Chase, and Brock Bowers. Check it out:As for the fallers, we'll start with any running back over 28, any receiver over 30, and any free agents that aren't certain to land a starting role. That last category is the toughest to forecast, but Rico Dowdle is the first name that comes to mind. And it's possible that Travis Kelce completely disappears from the Dynasty radar if he decides to ride off into the sunset.\nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine. There you'll find trade values for both Superflex and One-QB trades to help you dominate your Dynasty league.Here are my updated Dynasty Quarterback Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Running Back Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Wide Receiver Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Tight End Rankings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins (2-6) host the Baltimore Ravens (2-5) on Thursday Night Football to open the Week 9 NFL schedule. Last week, the Ravens snapped a four-game losing streak with a 30-16 victory over the Bears, coming out of their bye week. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has missed the last three games for the Ravens due to a hamstring injury, but he's expected to play on Thursday. The Dolphins, meanwhile, are coming off a 34-10 win over the Falcons last week behind four touchdown passes by Tua Tagovailoa. The Ravens are 7.5-point favorites, according to the latest Dolphins vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 50.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Ravens vs. Dolphins.

Jackson suffered his hamstring injury in Week 4 in a 37-20 loss to the Chiefs, and Baltimore went 1-2 in the last three weeks that he didn't start. Although the Dolphins are coming off a 34-10 win last week, that came against a 37-year-old Kirk Cousins making his first start of the season, and he was without his WR1 in Drake London (hip). Miami allowed at least 27 points in its prior three games, all losses against the Panthers, Chargers and Browns, as the majority of those teams don't strike much fear in opposing defenses. With Jackson back, the model expects the Ravens offense to have strong success on Thursday. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 52% of simulations.Over 50.5 pointsThe Ravens and Dolphins both have bottom-six scoring defenses in the NFL this season, with Baltimore ranking 30th at 30 points per game allowed, and Miami ranking tied for 26th at 26.9 ppg allowed this year. Both units played well last week, with the Ravens holding the Bears to 16 points and the Dolphins holding the Falcons to 10 points, but the statistics indicate that's more of an anomaly than the norm. The Dolphins have allowed at least 27 points in six of eight games, including four contests allowing more than 30 points, and the Ravens have allowed at least 37 points in four of seven games this season. Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns against an Atlanta defense that was strong against the pass over the first seven weeks, and with Jackson back on Thursday, this contest has shootout potential. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Quarterback Jayden Daniels is expected to be a full participant in practice all week, which means if all goes according to plan, he will return for this Sunday's matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. However, star wide receiver Terry McLaurin re-injured his quad, and has already been ruled out for Week 9. Daniels missed Monday night's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs after injuring his hamstring in the Week 7 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He did not practice all week, and Marcus Mariota started in his place. Daniels has already missed three games this season, leading his mother to ask fans to stop \"manifesting\" Robert Griffin III on her son. In five starts this season, the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year has completed 61% of his passes for 1,031 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 9 NFL picks: Bills cool off red-hot Chiefs in classic shootout, Texans upset Broncos\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for McLaurin, he tweaked his already-injured quad in the second half of Monday night's loss to Kansas City. Sunday will mark the fifth game he's missed this season. The 30-year-old held out of training camp while he fought for a contract extension, and was victorious in doing so. In late August, McLaurin signed what was reported to be a three-year, $96 million deal. However, he's on track to have his worst NFL season since being selected in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft, as McLaurin has caught just 13 passes for 203 yards and one touchdown in four games.\nTight end Zach Ertz said following the loss to the Chiefs that the \"clock is ticking\" for the 3-5 Commanders, and things don't get much easier with Washington's next two games coming against NFC contenders in the Seahawks and Detroit Lions. FanDuel Sportsbook currently considers the Commanders a long shot to make the playoffs at +430 -- the same odds as the rival Cowboys. \n            \n    ",

Rozier, a guard for the Miami Heat, and Billups, the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, were both placed on leave by the NBA, and on Wednesday it was reported that they were not being paid during their leave amid the investigation and their pay was being held in escrow until the charges against them were resolved. \n        \n            \n                Terry Rozier faced $8 million tax lien amid alleged involvement in sports betting ring\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe NBA Players Association took issue with Rozier being placed on unpaid leave and issued a statement acknowledging their intent to appeal that decision, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. \n\"While we are in agreement with the league that upholding the integrity of the game is of the utmost importance, their decision to place Terry on leave without pay is counter to the presumption of innocence and inconsistent with the terms of our Collective Bargaining Agreement,\" the statement says. \"We plan to challenge their decision via the proper channels.\"The players association's job is to advocate for the players and it won't want a precedent in this instance of players being put on unpaid leave in this kind of situation. The NBA will defend its decision by claiming it's to protect the Heat, by putting the money in escrow it ensures that money returns to the team if he is found guilty, but also allows Rozier to get paid out all of his salary if he is indeed innocent. \nThe ultimate determination will come from an arbiter, who will need to determine if the NBA's plan to have Rozier's pay put in escrow is within the boundaries of the CBA. \n            \n    ",

The Jets are trading cornerback Michael Carter II and a 2027 seventh-round pick to the Eagles in exchange for receiver John Metchie III and a 2027 sixth-round pick, according to ESPN.  Carter, 26, will get a fresh start in Philadelphia after a rough first half of the season in New York that saw him battle through injuries and a diminished role in the Jets' defense. The Eagles are clearly hoping that Carter -- who not long ago was hailed as one of the NFL's top slot corners -- can return to the form that earned him a three-year, $30.75 million contract ahead of the 2024 season. In order to complete the trade, Carter agreed to get rid of the $5 million injury guarantees in his contract for the 2026 season, according to NFL Media. \nThis marks the second time this year that the 25-year-old Metchie has been traded. A 2022 second-round pick, Metchie was traded from Houston to Philadelphia in August. The former Alabama standout produced little during his time in Philadelphia, though, as he caught just four passes for 18 yards while playing in seven games for the defending world champions. \nBoth players are heading to completely opposite situations. Carter is joining an Eagles team that is in first place in the NFC East and is vying to become only the second team since the Patriots to win back-to-back Super Bowls. Metchie is going to a Jets team that is 1-7 but is coming off of a dramatic, come-from-behind win over the Bengals. \n            \n    ",

The former Alabama standout signed with the Ravens in 2024 and delivered a massive output in his first season in Baltimore, carrying the ball 325 times for 1,921 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns while averaging 5.9 yards per carry. His physical style and durability remained elite even after turning 30, showcasing several long runs and a dominance after contact that reinforced his Hall of Fame trajectory. In 2025, Henry continues to be a major factor in Baltimore's offense, though his workload has slightly decreased. Through six games, he has totaled 88 carries for 439 yards (5.0 yards per carry) and four rushing touchdowns. While those numbers are below his 2024 peak, he remains one of the most respected and productive power backs in the league. See who else to roster right here.\nPart of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Dolphins running back De'Von Achane. The former third-round pick out of Texas A&M emerged as a dynamic dual-threat back for the Dolphins in 2024, rushing 203 times for 907 yards and six touchdowns while adding 78 receptions for 592 yards and six more scores. His average of 4.5 yards per carry showcased his balance of power and burst, while his impact as a receiver made him one of the NFL's most versatile backs. Through the early part of the 2025 season, Achane has maintained that explosiveness, totaling 107 carries for 539 rushing yards and three touchdowns while averaging 5.0 yards per carry. Although his touchdown pace has dipped slightly, his overall efficiency and big-play potential remain strong. Achane's combination of elite speed and pass-catching ability continues to make him a key weapon in Miami's high-octane offense. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Ravens vs. DolphinsKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday.

    "body": "\n        San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy has only played two games this season due to turf toe but has a chance to return this weekend when his team faces the New York Giants on the road. Purdy last played on Sept. 28, with Mac Jones taking over the starting QB duties while Purdy has been sidelined.49ers coach Kyle Shanahan on Monday expressed some optimism that Purdy could be back in the lineup on Sunday, but said the team would learn more at Wednesday's practice. Once Wednesday rolled around, Purdy was again a limited participant.Purdy initially injured the toe in Week 1, but was able to return for Week 4 -- only to re-aggravate the injury. So what does Purdy need to show in order to return to the field? Shanahan said it's confidence. \"If he gets out there, and he's hobbling around and stuff, he won't be out there [on Sunday]. So he's got to go out there and go through the practices and stuff and really let us know how good he feels because it's hard to know what's going on with the toe,\" Shanahan told reporters. \"They're really iffy things. Last time, we felt like he was feeling pretty good, looked pretty good in practice and then in the game, one hit and it set him back five or six weeks, whatever this has been ... four weeks.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 9 injury report: Lamar Jackson good to go for Ravens, Bryce Young returns to practice\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe team wants Purdy, who signed a five-year, $265 million extension in May, to avoid another setback, but Shanahan noted it's not easy to detect whether one is coming, \n\"It's kind of a sensitive situation and hopefully getting some reps in practice and stuff will give him that confidence that it's better than it was last time,\" Shanahan said. When asked if Purdy will let them know by the end of the week if he feels good enough to play, Shanahan quipped, \"I mean, I didn't give him a deadline.\"\"It's not as black and white as you guys want it to be\" the coach added.\nJones is dealing with a knee contusion but was a full participant in Wednesday's practice. He will get yet another start if Purdy is unable to go as the 49ers (5-3) look to bounce back from last week's 26-15 loss to the Houston Texans. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Carson Wentz harbors no ill will toward the Minnesota Vikings after he played through a dislocated shoulder that ultimately led to season-ending surgery. Wentz, who made five starts at quarterback for the Vikings in relief of JJ McCarthy, played in two more games after he initially sustained the injury during Minnesota's Week 5 win over the Cleveland Browns. Wentz played the entirety of the Vikings' Week 6 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles before being taken out during the late stages of last week's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers against his wishes. He told reporters he was well aware of the risk he was taking playing through that kind of injury. \"This isn't my first rodeo,\" Wentz said Wednesday. \"I'm not an idiot. I know what I was signing up for going out there. Nobody was forcing me, pressuring me, any of those things. Everybody's handled this tremendously. Communication's been phenomenal from coaches, trainers, all the things. I knew what we were doing all along.\"\n        \n            \n                Fair or not, J.J. McCarthy finds himself in do-or-die moment as the future of the Vikings\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPlaying in meaningful games, Wentz said, was the driving force behind his desire to continue to play through the injury and obvious pain that came with it. While he made 69 starts during his first five seasons in Philadelphia, the only starts Wentz had the previous two seasons were in Week 18 games that meant nothing in terms of playoff significance. \nDuring his five weeks as the starter, Wentz was able to help the Vikings win two games to remain in the thick of things in the NFC playoff race. Minnesota (3-4) will now move forward with McCarthy, who is in line to make his first start this Sunday in Detroit since he sustained an ankle injury back in Week 3. It may not have ended the way he had hoped it would, but Wentz said that he appreciated the opportunity to be a starting quarterback again for a playoff-caliber team, albeit for a short period of time. He was clear he doesn't regret his decision to play through an injury that resulted in him being placed on season-ending injured reserve. \n\"It's what I grew up dreaming of doing,\" he said. \"And when you lose it for a little bit, it's hard to want to give it up. So even with pain, and all the things that I knew were going to come with it, [I wanted] to play. I want to be out there, and I want to be helping this team however I can.\"\n            ",

The Irish have the rest advantage in coming off a bye, and they're 10-2 against the spread (ATS) over their last 12 post-bye games. The Irish also have the momentum advantage with a five-game win streak, compared to BC dropping its last seven contests. The Eagles are 1-5 ATS over their last six and were trounced, 44-0, by Notre Dame last season, which was the Irish's ninth straight victory in this series.

    "body": "\n        Shohei Ohtani isn't yet 24 hours removed from his first World Series starting assignment as a pitcher, yet he and the Los Angeles Dodgers are already figuring out how he'll factor into the rest of the series against the Toronto Blue Jays.\"I haven't talked to Shohei yet, but obviously he won't be available tonight,\" manager Dave Roberts said Wednesday prior to Game 5. \"We'll see where he comes in beyond that. But I haven't had that conversation. But certainly, when you're talking about Game 6, potentially Game 7 of the World Series, all hands on deck. So we'll see where that goes.\"If he can go, if it makes sense, certainly he would be an option.\"Ohtani, 31, threw six innings of four-run ball in Game 4 as part of a losing effort. He walked a batter, surrendered six hits, and struck out six of the 25 batters he faced. Ohtani, a night after reaching base a record nine times in a marathon Game 3, also went 0 for 3 at the plate with a walk.\nIt's not unusual for starting pitchers to be used during the postseason between their outings. Usually, those appearances come on the pitcher's throw day, or often two days after their start, when they're scheduled for side work. In Ohtani's case, that would rule him out for Game 5 but make him available thereafter.\"Of course, I'd like to prepare to be available for every game in case I'm needed,\" Ohtani said in Japanese following Game 4, according to the Los Angeles Times.It's worth remembering that the Dodgers eased Ohtani back into pitching this summer, seemingly with an eye on conserving strength for the stretch and playoff run. Ohtani, having missed the entire 2024 season as a pitcher following elbow surgery, did not throw more than 80 pitches in any of his first eight starts at the big-league level. That foresight could soon pay dividends.\nThe Dodgers, looking to become Major League Baseball's first repeat World Series winner since the New York Yankees in 1998-2000, have added incentive for using Ohtani in a relief role. They're tied 2-2 with the Blue Jays in the best-of-seven set, and their bullpen was one of the least reliable in all the majors, tying for the second-most meltdowns in the sport during the regular season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The college football coaching carousel creates chaos on an annual basis. With 10 jobs open already before the end of October (not including two gigs filled over the offseason on what may be a temporary basis), insiders are forecasting one of busiest seasons of coaching changes we've seen in recent years. It's not just about the coaches who are fired and filling those jobs. It's then about filling whatever vacancies are left behind, creating domino effect of coaching changes. This week on CBS Sports HQ, we sought out to create the most chaotic series of coaching dominos while still maintaining some tie to reality. It is very important that you, the reader and the viewer, to understand that this is a work of fan fiction and not to be mistaken for reporting. Some of these moves very well could end up happening, but ultimately the goal was to connect as many dots as possible while also creating as much upheaval as possible across the coaching landscape. \nSo let's have some fun and set off a couple of dominos to see how far down the coaching carousel rabbit hole we can go. Domino 1: The B1G One UCLA hires James Franklin Penn State hires Mike Elko Texas A&M hires Lincoln Riley USC hires Jedd Fisch Washington hires Ryan Grubb Penn State is already open, and while candidates like Matt Rhule and Curt Cignetti were the first names mentioned after James Franklin was fired it's possible that both coaches are going to stay with their current employer through at least the 2026 season. \nThat would have the Nittany Lions looking for some of the other top names in the industry, which would include seeing if a former Penn player and New Jersey native Mike Elko would be interested in getting the keys to one of the most storied programs in the country. Texas A&M opening would be an intriguing opportunity for anyone, but here we're using it as a chance for Lincoln Riley to return to Texas to restart the clock. And while Jedd Fisch has been doing great work at Washington, USC would be smart to check his availability given his success with the Huskies and at Arizona. UCLA gets the program-builder it needs with Franklin (sorry, Virginia Tech), and finally Washington could fill its open spot with former Huskies offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb, who is currently doing great work with Ty Simpson at Alabama.  Domino 2: The Lane Train fallout Florida hires Lane Kiffin Ole Miss hires Jon Sumrall Tulane hires Hugh Freeze Auburn hires Rhett Lashlee SMU hires Eric Morris While Ole Miss fans are feeling increasingly confident that Lane Kiffin will remain in Oxford, we all realize that any chaos scenario probably requires the Lane Train to be on the move and get the dominos falling in the SEC. \nTulane head coach Jon Sumrall is widely viewed as one of the top candidates for any SEC job, and in this run we've got Ole Miss securing his commitment to take over an operation that now has the blueprint for success in the modern era. That's where things get a little tricky, because Tulane will need a coach and it's possible that Hugh Freeze will need an off ramp after some tough years at Auburn. In a very Dana Holgorsen-to-Houston type move, our fan fiction has Freeze out at Auburn and landing on his feet with the Green Wave, which then opens up another opportunity in the SEC. \n        \n            \n                As coaching carousel floods, will other big schools -- like Auburn and Florida State -- pause on changes?\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile SMU is well-funded and certainly prepared for a bidding war, we've got Rhett Lashlee leaving to return to Auburn where he was previously an offensive coordinator and then the Mustangs tap one of the top Lone Star State coaches to replace him by hiring North Texas' Eric Morris. Domino 3: LSU, Beamer Ball and Brian Kelly Virginia Tech hires Shane Beamer South Carolina hires Brent Key Georgia Tech hires Brian Kelly LSU hires Eli Drinkwitz Missouri hires Scott Satterfield Cincinnati hires Mike Denbrock Shane Beamer was very careful about his coaching moves while Frank Beamer was still at Virginia Tech, choosing to link up up with his father only near the end of his program-changing run in Blacksburg. But enough time has passed now and things have been rocky enough in Columbia to guess (again, in fan fiction) that returning to Virginia Tech looks more enticing now than it may have in September. Beamer leaving South Carolina could have the Gamecocks looking to Brent Key given the previous SEC assistant experience and success he's had with Georgia Tech. \nAs for replacing Key we're using Atlanta as a soft landing spot for Brian Kelly, who might not command the same salary in the wake of the LSU buyout.Speaking of LSU, Eli Drinkwitz remains one of the top coaches on the hot board for any power conference job that thinks they can lure him away. The Tigers have arguably one of the best jobs in America, with three national championships under three different coaches in the 21st Century (only Ohio State can also claim such an honor). So Drinkwitz lands in Baton Rouge, which then has Missouri looking to another former App State coach in Scott Satterfield, who has flipped Cincinnati into a Big 12 title contender in just a few years. Then when it's time for the Bearcats to make a hire it's not going to be running it back with Brian Kelly, but instead with a former offensive coordinator in Mike Denbrock, who is currently doing great work with Marcus Freeman at Notre Dame. \nPhew. How's all that sound? \n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the self-proclaimed \"commissioner\" of horse racing, Mike Repole has called the sport's powers \"some of the worst leadership in sports,\" described the Breeders' Cup schedulers as \"stupid people\" and identified the Jockey Club as \"a blueblood scam.\"And that was just in the last 15 days.Repole, the 56-year-old billionaire horse owner, is uncaged, unfiltered and unapologetic. He says so himself on his X account (@repolestable).And now, on the eve of the 2025 Breeders' Cup, Repole has a new cause célèbre: eliminating rabbits from horse racing or, at the very least, changing the rules regarding them. In this case \"rabbits\" refers to horses who are entered in races not to win but with the sole purpose of ensuring a fast, early pace to help the chances of a late-running stablemate.Why is Repole so invested in changing something that has been allowed in horse racing since its inception? On Saturday, Repole's Fierceness will leave the starting gate in the $7 million Breeders' Cup Classic, North America's richest horse race, as the 5-2 morning-line favorite. He is the only horse in the field with any modicum of early speed, which is normally a huge edge. Or at least, he was the only horse in the field with any modicum of early speed until trainer Chad Brown entered both Sierra Leone and Contrary Thinking.While Sierra Leone is a legitimate Classic contender (he won the race last year and is the co-second choice on the morning line this year, at 7-2), Contrary Thinking is not. The 5-year-old horse has just two wins in seven career starts, has lost his last two races by more than 80 lengths combined and doesn't have more than an allowance win on his résumé. He is the equine equivalent of Eddie the Eagle or the Jamaican bobsled team going for Winter Olympics gold.\nWhat Contrary Thinking does have, however, is early speed. If all goes to plan, he will use that speed to ensure an honest early pace, prevent any horse from getting comfortable alone up front and set the race up for stablemate Sierra Leone, who took advantage of a hot early pace to win last year's Classic.\"The main objective [in entering Contrary Thinking] is get the field to just maybe string out just a touch to give everyone in the race a fair shot to pick their lane where they want to be instead of being a little bit bunched up,\" Brown told Caton Bredar of FanDuel Racing this week. \"And, look, if nobody goes with the horse, I think the horse has a lot of ability.\"Ever since the inclusion of Contrary Thinking in the Classic became a possibility, Repole has been vocal on X about the topic. He urged the Breeders' Cup and the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority to take action, saying the inclusion of a rabbit is a safety issue. He called upon the California Horse Racing Board to enforce its own rules, which say that a horse must be entered \"with the intention to win.\" He has repeatedly trolled Contrary Thinking on social media, calling him an \"emotional support rabbit\" for Sierra Leone. \nRepole's petitioning failed, and Contrary Thinking will run in the Classic. But whether you agree with Repole or not, his crusade brought more drama to the Classic than it would have had, especially after Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty had to be scratched from the race on Wednesday due to a fever.\nSays Repole, \"We are all fortunate I have a big, booming, loud voice.\"\n            ",

With the Pirates, Shelton went 306-440 (.410) with two last-place finishes and two fourth-place finishes in his four full seasons on the job. He previously served as the bench coach for the Twins under Paul Molitor in 2018 and Rocco Baldelli in 2019.Shelton took over a team deep in a rebuilding phase -- a phase that still hasn't yielded much in the way of wins at the big-league level -- and the team showed incremental improvement on his watch until they stalled out in 2024 and for the early weeks of this season. As a player, Shelton spent two minor league seasons as a catcher and first baseman in the New York Yankees system but never rose above Single-A. \nAs for the Twins, they're coming off a 2025 season in which they went 70-92 and placed fourth in the American League Central. That plus an 82-80 record and another fourth-place finish in 2024 cost Badelli his job in late September of this year. In all, Baldelli guided the Twins to three playoff berths in his seven seasons on the job. While there is some talent in place in Minnesota, Shelton walks into an uncertain ownership situation, especially when it comes to a top-down willingness to invest in payroll.\nWith Shelton's hiring in Minnesota, four MLB teams remain in need of a manager for the 2026 season: the Washington Nationals, San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies, and Atlanta Braves. \n            \n    ",

Don't expect the person who helped poach Kelly from Notre Dame in 2021 to make the next hire. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry told reporters Wednesday that the LSU Board of Supervisors will form a committee to find the school's next coach, rather than leaving the decision to athletic director Scott Woodward.\"We are not going down a failed path,\" Landry said. \"And I wanted to tell you something. This is a pattern. The guy that wrote [Kelly's] contract cost Texas A&M $70-something million. We have a $53 million liability. I believe that we are going to find a great coach … the board of supervisors are going to come up with a committee and they're going to find us a coach.\"Woodward has been responsible for two of the largest buyouts in college football history. Before arriving at LSU in 2019, he orchestrated one of the sport's most stunning hires as Texas A&M's athletic director, landing Jimbo Fisher from Florida State.\nThe Fisher era at Texas A&M fell short of expectations, and the school fired him before the conclusion of the 2023 season. Fisher had signed a 10-year, $95 million extension in 2021, leaving Texas A&M on the hook for a buyout exceeding $76 million.Kelly is also due a massive payout following last weekend's loss to Texas A&M. His 10-year contract, signed in 2021, paid him $9.4 million this season and still had six years and $58.2 million remaining. His buyout calls for 90% of the remaining salary, totaling $52.38 million.\nThe upcoming coaching carousel is expected to be full of movement, with LSU likely at the center. SportsLine oddsmakers list Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin, Tulane's Jon Sumrall, and Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady -- who held the same role at LSU during its 2019 national title season -- as names to watch in the search.\n            \n    ",

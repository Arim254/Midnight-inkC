    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                WWE\n            \n            \n    \n        The time is now. John Cena is set for his WWE farewell as part of Saturday Night's Main Event. The legendary wrestler completes a year-long goodbye to professional wrestling in Washington D.C. when he takes on Gunther in his final match in active competition. Gunther stood tall at the end of a 16-man tournament featuring superstars from Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and surprise opponents from Cena's past. After losing the world heavyweight title to Jey Uso at WrestleMania 41, Gunther had an odd year. He lost his mind as fans taunted him for tapping out against Uso and attacked both Michael Cole and Pat McAfee, which led to a match with McAfee at Backlash. Gunther then beat Uso in a rematch to reclaim the world heavyweight title before a detour to take on a retiring Goldberg. Gunther then dropped the world heavyweight title at SummerSlam before going on hiatus for multiple injuries.Cena's final year has been up and down with some incredible highs and a couple forgettable lows. He began the year by coming up short in the Royal Rumble when it was down to him and Jey Uso. Then, the infamous heel turn at the Elimination Chamber when Cena joined forces with The Rock and Travis Scott to beat down Cody Rhodes after earning his spot at WrestleMania. Cena then beat Rhodes at the event to break the record of most recognized championships at 17. After the title run and subsequent face turn came the return of Brock Lesnar to the fold where he and Cena faced off at Wrestlepalooza. Cena has also had fun throwback matches with CM Punk and AJ Styles along the way.Saturday night's card will also feature three matches between talents from Raw and SmackDown against talents from NXT, as one of Cena's final requests from the promotion was to showcase the future talent of the business against the top stars of today. That includes undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes taking on NXT champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles and Dragon Lee in tag team action against Je'Von Evans and Leon Slater as well as Bayley taking on Sol Ruca.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWhere to watch 2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main EventDate: Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025Location: Capital One Arena -- Washington, D.C.Start time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: Peacock (subscription required)2025 WWE Saturday Night's Main Event match cardJohn Cena vs. GuntherCody Rhodes vs. Oba FemiBayley vs. Sol RucaAJ Styles & Dragon Lee vs. Je'Von Evans & Leon Slater\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Brandon Royval and Manel Kape want the next shot at UFC flyweight champion Joshua Van. Royval and Kape have an important audition on their hands at UFC Fight Night on Saturday, the final event of 2025 before UFC moves to Paramount+.Royval (17-8) is the most exciting flyweight contender around. He holds the solo record for most Fight of the Night bonuses in the division's history, and is tied for most flyweight performance bonuses. \"Raw Dog\" is kicking himself for his recent loss to Van, a Fight of the Year frontrunner. On one hand, Royval wants to mature into a more thoughtful fighter. On the other hand, he wants to see if Kape has what it takes to survive a firefight.\"It depends on how I show up. I want to be smart and tactical, but my gut feeling is to put Manel Kape in a fight and see what the f-- is up with him,\" Royval told CBS Sports. \"I feel he hasn't been in a real fight in the UFC. No one has tested that part of him. In a fistfight, I bet on myself over the entire world. I bet I can outwill him. That's for damn sure.\"I fought Joshua Van as dumb as I could fight somebody. I knew I would do that. I wanted to box him in the pocket. I wanted to prove something. It didn't work out necessarily. That being said, I want to out-technique Manel Kape, but if it ends up in a fist fight, there's nothing wrong with that either.\"\nKape (21-7) warns Royval to think twice about brawling with him. Kape is one knockout away from tying the record for most divisional history. His precision is reflected in the statistics: better striking accuracy, defense, and takedown defense than Royval. Kape has won six of his last seven fights, and a win over Royval (No. 2) could put him in the perfect position to earn the next shot at Van.\"I've been [studying] Brandon Royval a lot. To me, it's like I'm  fighting someone familiar,\" Kape told reporters on Wednesday. \"In training, everybody wants to look like  Brandon Royval, imitate him, for me it's (the) usual. I'll be very comfortable on Saturday night.\"I'm just going to prove that I'm the man. I'm the fighter with the  better style to be a champion. I'm the fighter that this division  needs.\"  \nCheck out the full interview with Brandon Royval below.\nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassManel Kape -140Brandon Royval +100FlyweightKevin Vallejos -340Giga Chikadze +270FeatherweightCezary Oleksiejczuk -205Cesar Almeida +170  MiddleweightMelquizael Costa -125Morgan Charriere +105FeatherweightKennedy Nzechukwu -192Marcus Buchecha +110HeavyweightKing Green -192Lance Gibson Jr. +160  160-pound catchweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Dec. 13 | Start time: 10 p.m. ETLocation: UFC Apex -- Las VegasTV Channel: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  PredictionBrandon Royval vs. Manel Kape: Kape has never fought five rounds. His closest experience is a fourth-round submission win on the regional scene 10 years ago. Royval puts opponents in deep waters and edges out decisions. Just ask Tatsuro Taira, who Royval beat by split decision last year. The terms for Saturday's fight benefit Royval more than his opponent. The question is how much success will Kape have early in the fight. He's more powerful and technically proficient than Royval statistically. Royval's wrestling has improved, but it hasn't been his bread and butter. A textbook \"Raw Dog\" brawl is Royval's best chance to win. However, I worry Royval's chin gets cracked in the process, or he loses too many rounds early to cover ground late. Pick: Kape via KO3\n            ",

Tigres enter with a 1-0 lead in the two-legged affair thanks to Angel Correa's solo goal as he looks to push Tigres to their first title since 2023, when they won the Clausura. Here's everything to know about the huge match which you can watch live on CBS Sports Network.How to watch Toluca vs. Tigres, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Nemesio Diez -- Toluca, MexicoTV: CBS Sports Network Odds: Toluca -105; Draw +280; Tigres +250Correa's arrival in Mexico during the summer from Atletico Madrid has pushed Tigres to new heights while also turning around his own career. After being a rotational player in Spain, Correa joined ahead of the Club World Cup and hasn't looked back, scoring 15 goals and assisting four more in all competitions for Tigres. His eight goals during the regular season helped the team cope with injuries to Andre-Pierre Gignac, and now Tigres seem well placed for when the 40-year-old eventually decides to hang up his boots. But there are titles to win first, as Gignac, Correa, and Juan Brunetta will look to give the Toluca defense fits. But that doesn't mean that Toluca will go down easily. They come in atop the pile after earning the top seed in the playoffs while also looking to defend their Clausura 2025 trophy, where they took down Club America. Behind the hot scoring of Paulinho, Antonio Mohamed's Toluca side have become a tough-to-break-down outfit, and hosting this second leg, this will be a back-and-forth affair at the Estadio Nemesio Diez. Attackers may take the headlines, but these are also the teams that allowed the fewest goals in league play, with Tigres allowing 16 and Toluca allowing 18 in their 17 matches played. Goals could be hard to come by, but with it being the second leg in a final, things could open up if one side has to chase the match late.\nIn four of the last five finals, the second leg has seen at least two goals scored, and three of those saw three or more goals scored, so going by form, there will be goals despite the strength of these defenses. Only one team can win, and with only one goal separating them, it's anyone's guess who will win the Apertura final. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool were able to get back to their winning ways in the Premier League, defeating Brighton 2-0 at Anfield on Saturday. A brace from Hugo Ekitike was enough to keep Liverpool in front of Brighton, but the second goal was a significant one due to it being assisted by Mohamed Salah following his whirlwind week with the club. Following positive discussions with Arne Slot, Salah was included in the squad and got called upon much earlier than many would've expected, as Joe Gomez left the match due to an injury, and Salah was introduced in the 22nd minute of play. It wasn't a vintage performance by any sense of the term, with him taking three shots and netting an assist, but after claiming that the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, any contribution is more than what was expected.\nSalah will now depart to join the Egyptian national team for the Africa Cup of Nations, but manager Arne Slot expects him to come back to the club at the conclusion of the tournament amid transfer speculation. \"Actions speak louder than what I can say about it, [Salah] was here, so that tells you how the conversation yesterday went, and he was the first substitute I made, so that already gives an answer to all the questions that you have,\" Slot said following the match.\"He goes to the AFCON, and we have a lot of games to play and yeah, he's a Liverpool player, so I expect him to be back afterwards.\"\nWith interest from the Saudi Premier League, there is wonder of where Salah will play his soccer once the January transfer window opens, but if his manager is to be believed, it will be at Liverpool. Granted, there isn't much else that Slot can say publicly, but after Salah was benched in three consecutive matches and left out of the squad for their 1-0 victory over Inter in Champions League play midweek, this is an improvement.Fans also chanted Salah's name following the full-time whistle as he was the last player to leave the pitch at Anfield. It wasn't a moment that read as a goodbye from Liverpool, but it was something that was meaningful for him.\nThat was Salah's third Premier League assist of the season and one that helped showcase the breakout that Ekitike is having for the Reds. He now has seven goals in the league, and in a season that has seen Salah's scoring dip while Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz have struggled to integrate into the side, his performances have been a silver lining for Liverpool.\nWithout Salah, Ekitike will be relied on, but if the Reds can get the two of them going together following AFCON, there could be hope for the season with Salah's future looking a little more red than last week.\n            ",

They tied the 2015-16 Warriors for the best 25-game start in NBA history and handed the Suns their worst loss in franchise history (49 points). The Spurs, meanwhile, took care of Luka Dončić, LeBron James and the Lakers without Victor Wembanyama. It remains to be seen if Wemby, who has missed a month with a calf strain, will suit up for the semifinal tilt against OKC.In the East, the Magic and Knicks were both victorious on Tuesday night. The Magic rallied after giving up the first 15 points to the Heat to come back and defeat their in-state rival. The Knicks got 35 points from Jalen Brunson in a road win against the Raptors. The Thunder are currently the favorites to win the 2025 NBA Cup (-225 at FanDuel).

    "body": "\n        Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman Trophy as the most outstanding player in college football. He beat out Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love and Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin for the honor. The Hoosiers' signal caller earned 643 first-place votes, 191 second-place votes and 51 third-place votes. Pavia finished second with 189 first-place votes, 352 second-place votes and 164 for third. Mendoza came from humble beginnings, rated as the No. 134 quarterback in the Class of 2022. Before he earned a late offer from California, he was set to go to Yale and play in the Ivy League. Even after arriving in Berkeley, he had to battle for the starting job each season before finally settling in and breaking out as a sophomore. \n        \n            \n                Who will be at forefront of 2026 Heisman race?

Instead of choosing a traditional power, he was sold on Indiana coach Curt Cignetti, offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and a rising program in Bloomington. His brother Alberto was also a quarterback at the school, but the addition of Fernando proved to be one of the greatest in program history.\nDuring Indiana's historic run to the No. 1 overall seed in the College Football Playoff, Mendoza was sensational. The junior completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards and led college football with 33 passing touchdowns. The Hoosiers won the Big Ten outright for the first time since 1945 with a perfect 13-0 record. Unlike nearly every other candidate, Mendoza had multiple Heisman moments. In a 27-24 comeback win against Penn State, he led a game-winning drive and connected with Omar Cooper on an acrobatic touchdown that will be replayed for years. In the Big Ten Championship Game against Ohio State, he took a third-down snap and hit Charlie Becker for a 33-yard pass that helped the Hoosiers run out the clock in a 13-10 upset. \nNow, the Heisman winner prepares to take Indiana into the CFP. The Hoosiers play the winner of No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Alabama in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Indiana has never won a national championship.  \nSurprisingly, Mendoza is the first Heisman Trophy winner to play in the CFP since Alabama's Bryce Young in 2021. Young led the Crimson Tide to the national title game before falling just short to rival Georgia. Between 2014 and 2021, seven of the eight Heisman winners earned a trip to the CFP.  Mendoza is also the first Big Ten player to win the Heisman Trophy since Ohio State's Troy Smith in 2006, and just the second in the 21st Century. USC and Oregon have produced a combined five Heismans since 2000, but all came while members of the Pac-12. Indiana has not produced a Heisman finalist since running back Anthony Thompson in 1989. 2025 Heisman Trophy voting    RankPlayerSchool1st2nd3rdTotal points1Fernando MendozaIndiana643191512,3622Diego PaviaVanderbilt1893521641,4353Jeremiyah LoveNotre Dame461572677194Julian SayinOhio State81181724325Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech17561322956Jeremiah SmithOhio State4183684 Elevating the Hoosiers Indiana reached the College Football Playoff last season, but lost by double-digits against Notre Dame as the offense struggled to create opportunities. Statistically, the unit hasn't been much different in 2025. Against elite competition, though, Mendoza has proven to be a significant upgrade.  \nIn historic wins over No. 1 Ohio State and No. 3 Oregon, Mendoza completed 65% of his passes and averaged 8.1 yards per attempt against two of the best defenses in college football. He completed the game-changing 33-yard pass against Ohio State to run out the clock. Total stats tell part of the story, but his ascension in key moments has been the difference between excellent and national caliber at Indiana.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        During a media scrum earlier this week, Alabama coach Nate Oats remarked that he warned his team that Arizona's Brayden Burries was \"a kid that can go off for 30 at any point,\" according to the Tuscaloosa News' Emilee Smarr. Oh, how prescient that turned out to be. The five-star freshman erupted for a career-high 28 points to help No. 1 Arizona run away and hide from No. 12 Alabama in the second half of Saturday's 96-75 rout in Birmingham.It's Arizona's fifth win over a ranked team in the first nine games, and a true \"I'm here\" moment for Burries, who had struggled to find his footing in early November but is on rock-solid ground a month later.\nThe 6-4, 205-pound guard obliterated Alabama's smaller backcourt with bouldering drives, feathery 3s and one pinpoint lob to Tobe Awaka that led to the basket nearly getting uprooted from the stanchion. He packs a scoring punch into a roster that has spades of physicality and brute-force strength. \nWho knows where this win will end up ranking in the grand scheme of things, but Arizona's detonation of the Tide showcased just how devastating the top-ranked Wildcats can be when the shot-making accompanies the typical avalanche of paint buckets.The numbers tell the whole story.Arizona (9-0) nuked Alabama (7-3) inside the arc with a 44-20 advantage in paint points. It out-rebounded the Tide 52-32, including 21 offensive rebounds in the first 29 minutes of regulation. Arizona's five-man platoon of Motiejus Krivas and Tobe Awaka combined for 16 offensive rebounds alone. Alabama got eight rebounds total from its three centers.Arizona took 84 shots compared to just 56 for Alabama. Turns out, it's a whole lot easier to win basketball games when you take 32 more shots.\nOh, and for all the tizzy about Alabama potentially being able to tilt the scales with a barrage of 3-pointers, it was Arizona that had more triples on its resume until garbage time when the game was far out of reach.Burries (5 of 10 from 3-point range) provided that extra splash of hot sauce that fueled the Wildcats' 28-6 second-half run to show that it's in a completely different zip code as a national title contender than Alabama right now. It did it all while enduring an off night from Koa Peat, who managed just six points, a full 10 below his season average.Arizona is now the third team to just overwhelm Alabama on the glass, joining Purdue and Gonzaga. If Oats' crew has an early exit in March, the rebounding follies could be that Achilles heel. \nMeanwhile, it's full steam ahead for undefeated Arizona, which should stick at No. 1 in the polls come Monday and heads back to Tucson with its fourth Quad 1 victory and a real belief that Burries has broken through for good.With the freshman wall in the rearview mirror, the possibilities are endless for Burries and this club. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arizona State and coach Kenny Dillingham are working toward an agreement on an updated contract as speculation swirls around his potential candidacy for the opening at Michigan, according to 247Sports. The two sides are \"close\" to reaching an agreement for a new deal, which would include an increase to his annual base salary.Dillingham confirmed after practice Saturday that Arizona State and his agent began working on contract amendments shortly after the conclusion of the regular season. The talks between athletic director Graham Rossini and Dillingham's agent have continued over the past two weeks, per 247Sports. The discussions, which took on added urgency following Michigan's firing of Sherrone Moore earlier this week, are focused on increasing Dillingham's guaranteed compensation and making his contract less dependent on performance-based incentives. Dillingham said Saturday he has not spoken with Michigan or any other programs regarding coaching vacancies.Dillingham had already triggered an automatic $200,000 raise by winning eight regular-season games, which would increase his 2025 base salary from $5.8 million to $6 million, along with an automatic one-year extension through Dec. 31, 2030. Any amended contract would need approval from the Arizona Board of Regents.\n        \n            \n                Michigan coaching candidates: Kalen DeBoer, Kenny Dillingham among options after sudden Sherrone Moore firing\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDillingham is an Arizona State alum: 'This is home'Dillingham was on the practice field Saturday as Arizona State prepared for the Sun Bowl against Duke on Dec. 31. The practice session, originally scheduled for 9 a.m. local time, was moved to 10:45 a.m.\nAfter practice, Dillingham was asked what makes coaching at Arizona State special. He paused for 20 seconds and became visibly emotional, with tears in his eyes, before answering.\"I love this place,\" Dillingham said. \"It's a special place to me.\"\nDillingham, 35, a Scottsdale native and Arizona State alumnus, has repeatedly expressed a desire to remain with the Sun Devils. Following the Nov. 15 win against West Virginia, amid swirling coaching rumors, he told reporters, \"I was never leaving,\" according to 247Sports.\"This is home,\" Dillingham said. \"But you do have to continue to push, and my job in running a program is to push and push and push until you can't push any more. If I didn't do that, I'd be cheating my players, I'd be cheating my staff, I'd be cheating my fanbase, I'd be cheating everyone in this city, I'd be cheating the local businesses that feed off us winning, I'd be cheating everyone. So my No. 1 goal, always, is to do whatever I can to push the envelope for Arizona State football.\"\nDillingham's potential long-term stay is influenced in part by family. He and his wife, Briana, both Arizona State graduates, are expecting their second child early next year, and his parents and in-laws live nearby. \"Having the family support here is a really cool thing,\" Dillingham said in an early November interview, noting that the proximity allows him to focus on the program.Since taking over as coach in 2023, Dillingham has helped elevate Arizona State to national relevance. The Sun Devils, coming off a Big 12 Championship and the program's first College Football Playoff berth in 2024, have posted a 19-7 record since the start of his second season. That Big 12 title came after the Sun Devils were picked to finish last in the conference in the preseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Vegas! For the third time in as many seasons, the NBA Cup is shifting to Sin City for its dramatic conclusion, and the league couldn't have asked for a more compelling group of finalists. The defending champion (June variety, not Cup variety) Oklahoma City Thunder, the league's brightest young star in Victor Wembanyama, the Eastern Conference favorite New York Knicks, and the Orlando Magic, who are now 14-6 since their 1-4 start.The players on our four finalists have all earned at least six figures, but there's still quite a bit of money on the line. Semifinals losers will pocket $102,994 per player, while the loser of the championship game doubles that figure for $205,988. The winner of the whole tournament walks away with $514,971 per player, but be honest, you're more interested in how you can make money off of this thing than the players. Fortunately, we've got you covered. Below are our best bets for both semifinal matchups on Saturday.Orlando Magic vs. New York Knicks\nThe Magic have developed a bit of a reputation for playing through injuries lately, but which injuries are essential here? The Magic turned their season around with Paolo Banchero sidelined, but since his rookie year, they are 31-27 without him in the lineup. Now Banchero is back, but just like last season, Franz Wagner got hurt soon after. That's a tougher injury for the Magic to stomach. Orlando is 13-22 without Wagner in the lineup in that same span. This season, Magic lineups featuring Banchero but no Wagner have been outscored by 5.7 points per 100 possessions, so the safe pick here is the Knicks, especially now that OG Anunoby is back in the fold. The Pick: Knicks -5.5I'm leaning under for a few reasons. There's the fact that this is a big game in an unusual environment that tips at a weird time (2:30 local), and that could lead to shooting struggles as players deal with the disturbance to their routine. We have a relatively slow Knicks team on one end of the floor and a Magic team that will be playing hard on the other, seeking some measure of revenge after Wagner got hurt against New York. And then there's the matter of history. Every NBA Cup game in Vegas that did not involve Tyrese Haliburton went under this total. Granted, that's only four games, so take it with a grain of salt, but as we saw last postseason, Haliburton is immune to pressure. Everyone else seems to play a bit tight under the bright lights, so altogether, I have a slight under lean. The Pick: Under 224.5\nI'm working a theory here: Paolo Banchero has averaged 22.8 shots per game in the playoffs in his career. Is this a playoff game? No. But he tends to be at his most shot-happy in big games, and by regular-season standards, this one qualifies, especially with Wagner out. So I'm going to take Banchero's over on the basis of volume. He'll put up a lot of shots and hit enough to hit the over. The Pick: Banchero Over 22.5 PointsSan Antonio Spurs vs. Oklahoma City Thunder\nIf you just want to know who's going to win the game? You should pick the Thunder because they've only lost once. Picking them to lose a game is irresponsible. Picking their opponent to cover? A bit more plausible. The Thunder are only 14-11 against the spread. In fairness, that's mostly because their spreads are typically massive, but that's the case here. The Spurs are 10.5-point underdogs. Well, they've only lost three games by double digits all season, and they've never lost by more than 13. The Spurs don't really get blown out. Their three-headed guard monster of De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and Dylan Harper is as good an answer to Oklahoma City's ball-pressure as there is in the NBA. The Spurs are a pretty low-turnover team, and they draw a fair number of fouls, both of which are useful against the Thunder. Plus, Victor Wembanyama is expected back. That's a nice little cherry on top here. The Pick: Spurs +10.5\nThe Thunder rank just 15th in pace for the season... but fourth since Jalen Williams returned to the lineup. Their lowest-scoring game since then, their blowout quarterfinal win over the Suns, totaled 227 points, just half a point under this game's total. They've blown by it in their five other games in that span. The Thunder have a historic defense, but if both teams are flying up and down the floor, the points can rack up pretty quickly, even if they aren't coming all that efficiently. These are two of the NBA's most athletic groups, so I'm expecting a more offensive game. The Pick: Over 227.5\nThere's going to be an instinct to go under on Wembanyama's lines for fear of a minutes limit. Counterpoint: he averaged over 30 minutes in games in which he returned from an absence last season. Obviously, he's never returned from an absence this long before, but the Spurs have tended to allow him most of his usual workload in return games before. Plus, Wembanyama absolutely relishes big moments, and he's had so few of them in the NBA. Think of opening night or the Paris trip last year. He's going to want to put on a show, especially against Chet Holmgren. I'm expecting fireworks. The Pick: Wembanyama Over 17.5 Points\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers' return to the gridiron is being fast-tracked, as the Indianapolis Colts have activated the 44-year-old quarterback for their Week 15 road matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. Rivers will start on Sunday, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reports, after ending his five-year retirement on Tuesday by signing with the Colts practice squad. Now, he's on the verge of once again being a starting quarterback. The Colts are desperate at quarterback. Daniel Jones suffered a torn Achilles in last Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture. Rookie Riley Leonard, who was expected to replace Jones in the starting lineup, has a knee injury, but is off the injury report. With the Colts' season on the line at 8-5, they are likely turning to the quarterback that last led them to the playoffs.Rivers spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, but his last season came in 2020 with the Colts. He threw for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while the Colts went 11-5 and earned a wild card spot. Rivers' final NFL game came on Jan. 9, 2021 -- a 27-24 playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills, in which he completed 27 of 46 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns. An eight-time Pro Bowler, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter in his incredible career, and ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421). Fewer than five months ago, Rivers signed a one-day contract with the Chargers and announced his retirement. The franchise even put out an emotional video. But things have changed and Rivers will be back in an NFL uniform on Sunday in Seattle. \nWhy did the Colts sign Rivers?Why did the Colts go and sign the 44-year-old Rivers instead of a free agent like Ryan Tannehill, or maybe even another NFL legend like Tom Brady? It's likely because Rivers has familiarity with the Colts franchise, coach Shane Steichen and the team's offensive system. Rivers has been a high school football coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic, where he coaches his son Gunner Rivers -- who is also a quarterback. CBS Sports broadcaster and NFL legend J.J. Watt recently learned that Rivers ran the same offense as the Colts for his son's team. If you don't believe that, Rivers and Steichen apparently spoke weekly about their scheme, discussing plays and even film. It's a reason why the Colts are expected to start Rivers five days after he rejoined the NFL. \n        \n            \n                Philip Rivers' impossible comeback, Joe Burrow's unrest and what sources are saying around the NFL\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe historical impactIf he starts as expected, Rivers will become the fifth quarterback to start an NFL game at age 44 or older. He adds his name to a list that includes Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Sunday marks 1,800 days since Rivers' last NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research. It's the longest layoff by a 40-year-old starting quarterback in NFL history. The previous record was DeBerg in 1998 (1,777 days). \nRivers is older than Steichen and Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, making it the sixth instance since 1950 where a starting quarterback was older than both head coaches in a game. In fact, Rivers is older than 13 NFL head coaches. Rivers has 10 children and is a grandfather. Now, he has been charged with saving the Colts' season. The matchup against SeattleThe Seahawks are a tough matchup for Rivers right off the bat, as Seattle already matched its win total from last season at 10-3 and boasts a ferocious defense. This unit ranks second in the NFL in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per play allowed (4.5) and third-down defense (33%). Seattle has allowed just nine total points over the past two games, and leads the NFL with six non-offensive touchdowns.\nUnfortunately for the Colts, the Week 15 matchup against Seattle isn't the only tough game remaining on the schedule. Indy actually has the toughest remaining schedule in the NFL (.692 opponent win percentage). Three of the Colts' final four opponents rank top seven in the NFL in pressures. WeekOpponent15at Seattle Seahawks16vs. San Francisco 49ers17vs. Jacksonville Jaguars18at Houston TexansColts' chances to make the playoffsWhat are the chances Rivers can come in and deliver for the Colts, stop their slide and get Indy back to the postseason? Let's take a look at what SportsLine's data says:TeamChances to win AFC SouthChances to make playoffsJacksonville Jaguars (9-4)49.6%96.5%Houston Texans (8-5)44.2%86.7%Indianapolis Colts (8-5)6.3%41.8%AFC playoff picture Here is how the AFC looks through 14 weeksSeedTeam1.Denver Broncos (11-2)2.New England Patriots (11-2)3.Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)4.Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)5.Los Angeles Chargers (9-4)6.Buffalo Bills (9-4)7.Houston Texans (8-5)***ON THE BUBBLE8.Indianapolis Colts (8-5)9.Baltimore Ravens (6-7)10.Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)11.Miami Dolphins (6-7)12.Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)As the data indicates, losing Jones is a massive blow. But the Colts were crashing even before their quarterback went down. The Colts lost three straight games since starting 8-2, and also lost star cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck) to injury. Indianapolis is in danger of becoming the first NFL team to start 8-2 or better and miss the playoffs since the 1995 Oakland Raiders, but the Colts are hoping this Hail Mary at quarterback pays immediate dividends. \n            ",

College football bowl season provides an opportunity for fan bases to see their team one last time and get a sneak peek into the future as younger players get into the game. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        Army and Navy are set to clash once again in one of the most anticipated matchups of each college football season, this year in Baltimore as the storied service academies enter the 126th chapter into their legendary rivalry. The Midshipmen lead the all-time series with a 63-55-7 record against the Black Knights as we enter this year's much-anticipated game.  Both teams are headed to bowl games afterwards, with Army facing UConn in the Fenway Bowl and Navy playing Cincinnati in the Liberty Bowl, but before they enter the postseason, they will face off for bragging rights at M&T Bank Stadium. It's the culmination of a strong year for both programs, but players on both sides know success for the season is often defined by the outcome of the Army-Navy Game.  Army comes in at 6-5, shaking off a slow start to win five of their last seven games to get above .500 heading into its finale with Navy. The Black Knights have found some good form defensively in the back half of the season, allowing 24 points or fewer in six of the last seven games, and their offense has found some footing under first-year starter Cale Hellums.  \n        \n            \n                2025 Army vs. Navy Game uniforms: Black Knights, Midshipmen will honor 250 years of service in 126th meeting\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn the other side, Navy has a chance to make some program history, as a win would give it back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time ever. The Midshipmen ran out to a 7-0 start and looked like a threat to reach the American title game, but a loss to North Texas -- and then Notre Dame -- slowed their momentum some. They bounced back to close the year strong with wins over South Florida and Memphis to enter the Army-Navy Game at 9-2, and have done so courtesy of an explosive offense led by quarterback Blake Horvath. \nFollow along with live updates, highlights and analysis as the 126th Army vs. Navy Game takes center stage on Saturday.Where to watch Army vs. Navy 2025 liveDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium -- Baltimore, MDTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium Army vs. Navy 2025: Need to know Which offense can crack some explosive plays? Anyone who has ever watched the Army-Navy Game knows that it will be a grueling, physical battle in the trenches. These are two option teams that know exactly what the other wants to do and have more experience maintaining eye discipline and run fits than any other opponent. That tends to create a low-scoring, field position battle. \nIt's so hard to sustain drives for touchdowns in this game because the defenses are so disciplined against the option, which also means any explosive plays hold extra importance. In that department, Navy has been far better this season. The Midshipmen are fourth in the country in 20+ yard runs (30), while Army is all the way back in 84th (12).  Navy's passing attack has been a far bigger weapon this year compared to Army's, as Horvath has thrown for 1,390 yards and nine touchdowns compared to just 504 yards and three touchdowns for Hellums. No one will confuse the Midshipmen with the Air Raid this season, but Horvath's arm does provide them with an additional threat they can spring on defenses that get too aggressive trying to stop the run.  That doesn't mean Army can't dial up something at the right time to create a chunk play, but the Midshipmen provide a more constant threat for explosives both on the ground and through the air -- as we saw in this game a year ago. Limiting that big play potential will be the biggest challenge for this Black Knights defense that has been extremely solid of late, while the offense will need to find a way to scheme up an explosive or two themselves.  \nSpecial teams matter: Field position is always critical in this matchup, and there tend to be a number of punts as the two teams try to pin the others back deep. Execution from start to finish from the punt units will be paramount. The coverage unit that can execute and pin the other team inside their own 10 can set up their team for success, while a punt block or a muffed return can flip the field and swing the outcome.  Points are at a premium in the Army-Navy Game, and that puts added pressure on the field goal units when they do get trotted out -- although, both teams tend to be aggressive going for it on fourth-and-short situations. Army's Dawson Jones is 12 of 17 on field goal attempts this season and a perfect 29 of 29 on extra points. Navy's Nathan Kirkwood has likewise been perfect on XPs, hitting all 46 he's attempted, and hit 9 of 10 field goal attempts.  It'll be cold and a bit breezy on Saturday afternoon in Baltimore, and the special teams units on both sides will need to be on point.  \nBall is the program: Explosive plays don't just have to happen on offense. Ball security is always of the utmost importance in the Army-Navy Game. Horvath and Hellums will have to be sharp with their ball-handling on the option, both on the give and the pitch, as putting the ball on the ground is the cardinal sin in this game.  For as much as they run the ball and how many pitches and pulls are involved in each play, both of these offenses do a great job protecting the football. Army has lost just five fumbles all year, while Navy has given it away six times. That means it shouldn't be an expectation that either team will cough it up, but any opportunity a defense gets, either on a mishandled option give/pitch or by punching the ball out, could be a huge swing.  Army vs. Navy 2025 prediction, pick  \nSo much points to Navy in this game, but when it comes to this rivalry, it's rarely that simple. The old \"throw out the record books\" adage is firmly in play here, and with the form Army's shown in the second half of the season on defense, I expect it to keep this tight all the way through the fourth quarter. We haven't seen Navy in a defensive, grind-it-out type game since the Rice game in late September, and if history tells us anything, that's what we are in store for on Saturday. \nArmy is going to try and limit possessions and make this a rock fight, and I think the Black Knights can largely be successful. That said, even in a game that's played at that preferred pace, Navy's offense just has more firepower and Horvath can create a couple big plays that make the difference in a win for the Midshipmen.

    "body": "\nThe hot streak came to an end last week with my NFL picks.Time to regroup for the stretch run.It wasn't an awful week -- we've had those before -- but it just wasn't close to being good enough. I went 6-8 against the spread last week and 7-7 straight up. That brings my season record to 106-101-1 ATS and 140-67-1 straight up.Of course I would have had a .500 record ATS if Pete Carroll hadn't kicked a field goal on the last play of the game for the Raiders, but that's in the past now. On to Week 15 we go, with a better week coming for me. All Week 15 NFL betting lines via DraftKings SportsbookArizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Texans are playing their best football at this time of the year, keyed by the dominant defense. The Cardinals are a mess. Their defense is really bad right now, which should help C.J. Stroud get it going. Look for a big game from him, and the Texans defense will continue to dominate. Texans big.  Pick: Texans 30, Cardinals 13Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Ravens have lost two straight, including one to the Bengals two weeks ago. Joe Burrow lit them up in that game at Baltimore. What's to think that will change here since the Ravens defense isn't playing well. But what will change is the Ravens offense. I think it will show better than it did the last time and the Ravens will find a way to pull this one out.Pick: Ravens 30, Bengals 24\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 picks and score predictions: Patriots and Broncos both lose, Dolphins shock Steelers\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBuffalo Bills (-1.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Patriots are coming off a bye, while the Bills are coming off a come-from-behind victory over the Bengals. Josh Allen was Josh Allen in that one and that's the way it has to be for the Bills to win. He wasn't the last time these teams met, which is why the Patriots won. This time will be different. Allen wins it with his usual big plays.Pick: Bills 30, Patriots 28Cleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (-7.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis will be Shedeur Sanders starting again for the Browns, and it should be. But this will be a much-tougher challenge than last week. The Bears lost a tough one to the Packers last week, so you know they will be back focused here. That matters as the Browns have nothing to play for anymore. Bears win it.Pick: Bears 30, Browns 17Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is truly desperation time for the Chiefs. They can't afford another loss. The Chargers beat them in Week 1, but this will be different. Los Angeles comes in on a short week and their offensive line is bad. Look for the Chiefs to win it behind their defense.Pick: Chiefs 23, Chargers 17Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Eagles are riding a three-game winning streak, but the Raiders are the perfect tonic to fix all that ails them. The Eagles have offensive issues, but this is the week to change that. Look for them to ride Saquon Barkley and they won't turn it over like they did in the loss to the Chargers on Monday night. The Raiders offense is awful and their line is really bad. The Eagles feast on that.  Pick: Eagles 28, Raiders 10New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-12)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jaguars are riding high as they took over first place last week after beating the Colts, while the Jets are a mess. They have injury issues at quarterback, but does it matter who plays? The Jaguars offense has really come on and I think that continues here. Jaguars big as Trevor Lawrence plays well again.  Pick: Jaguars 31, Jets 13Washington Commanders at New York Giants (-2)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis will be Marcus Mariota in as the starter for the Commanders with Jayden Daniels hurt again. The Commanders were terrible last week on defense against the Vikings, and have struggled on that side of the ball all year, so this is a chance for Jaxson Dart to do some good things, and I think he will. Giants win it.  Pick: Giants 30, Commanders 20\nCarolina Panthers at New Orleans Saints (+2.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Panthers are off their bye, while the Saints are back home after two on the road. The Saints beat the Panthers in Week 10, but this Panthers team has been playing much better football lately. Saints quarterback Tyler Shough is playing well and the New Orleans defense can keep them in this one. Saints win it in an upset.  Pick: Saints 23, Panthers 21Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (-5.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a big game in terms of playoff seeding. The Lions are 8-5 and can't afford another loss, while the Rams are pushing for a division title and the top seed. The Rams offense got back on track last week and the Lions have issues on defense. That's a bad combination. Look for Matthew Stafford to light things up against his former team, while Jared Goff can't keep up. Rams win it.  Pick: Rams 34, Lions 27Green Bay Packers (-2.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is the game of the week, featuring two teams that are currently the second seed in their respective conferences right now. Both have outstanding defenses, but the Green Bay passing game is better. I think that will be the difference. Jordan Love will win it with his arm.  Pick: Packers 24, Broncos 20Indianapolis Colts at Seattle Seahawks (-13.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+) \nThis might be 44-year-old Philip Rivers at quarterback for the Colts. It won't matter. This is a brutal test against a dominant defense in Seattle. Look for a big game from that defense, no matter who plays quarterback for the Colts. Sam Darnold will hit some big shots against a Colts defense that has struggled in recent weeks. Seahawks big.  Pick: Seahawks 31, Colts 16Tennessee Titans at San Francisco 49ers (-12.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is consecutive road games for the Titans coming off a road victory at Cleveland. The 49ers are in off a bye. That's a bad combination and San Francisco is in a playoff chase, while the Titans are playing out the string. Oh, and the 49ers are much better. Look for a big 49ers victory.  Pick: 49ers 32, Titans 17Minnesota Vikings (+5.5) at Dallas CowboysSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC\nThe Vikings are playing out the string, but they did get a nice game from J.J. McCarthy last week, which is big for the future. Now let's see him do it on the road this week. The Cowboys are rested after losing last Thursday to the Lions. I see them bouncing back here as Dak Prescott has a solid day, but the Vikings will hang around.  Pick: Cowboys 24, Vikings 21Miami Dolphins at Pittsburgh Steelers (-3.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Dolphins, thanks to a four-game winning streak, are still alive in the playoff picture. They won last week on the road against the Jets and now must face a Steelers team coming off an impressive victory over the Ravens. The weather is supposed to have temperatures under 40 degrees, which isn't a good thing for the Dolphins, who have struggled in those conditions. The Steelers will take it as Aaron Rodgers plays well. Pick: Steelers 27, Dolphins 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season has been one of the most unpredictable in recent memory. As we embark on Week 15, we're currently looking at a slate where Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, and Joe Burrow are out of the playoff picture. Meanwhile, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills are on the brink of losing the AFC East crown to the New England Patriots. Oh, and Philip Rivers is back and gearing up to start for the Indianapolis Colts. Madness! With the league effectively flipped upside down, however, it does make for an exciting challenge to try and pinpoint who'll come out on top each week. As we rocket towards the end of the regular season, the weight of these games has reached all-time highs, and there are even some playoff tickets that can be punched on Sunday. For instance, New England can win the AFC East if they defeat Buffalo at Gillette Stadium, while both the Los Angeles Rams and Denver Broncos can secure their spots in the playoffs with wins. As we gear up for what is expected to be another incredible weekend in the NFL, let's make sure we have our bets sorted. Below, you can find our best bets for the Week 15 slate, and picks for every other contest. All odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Baltimore Ravens at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)Lamar Jackson is 10-2 in his career against the Bengals, and specifically 6-2 in his head-to-heads with Joe Burrow. On the surface, that should give bettors some confidence in Baltimore, right? Well, this isn't exactly the same Jackson that we've come to know and opposing defensive coordinators fear.\nThe Ravens QB just hasn't looked right, and that's been the case for weeks, including during Sunday's loss to Pittsburgh, where he completed just 54.3% of his passes. That inaccuracy has been an issue for the bulk of the year, averaging just a 55.6% completion rate over his last five starts. As we saw during a 32-14 Bengals win over Baltimore in Week 13, this version of Jackson cannot keep up with Burrow. The Ravens also have not been a trustworthy bet, failing to cover in four straight coming into Week 15, and are just 4-9 ATS on the season.Projected score: Bengals 27, Ravens 24The pick: Bengals +2.5\nGreen Bay Packers at Denver BroncosSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)Everyone is going to fade the Broncos after they were burned at the buzzer last week in what was arguably the worst beat of the season against the Raiders. However, don't let the emotions of that game cloud your judgment here. \nThe Packers are coming off a last-second win over the Chicago Bears, which thrust them back atop the NFC North and the No. 2 seed in the NFC. They've garnered tons of momentum with that victory, which, if you've been paying attention to the Packers this season, is exactly the time they give it all back with a loss.We've seen duds from Green Bay at various points this season, and I wonder if we get one here -- particularly on the road in a tough environment against one of the best defenses in the NFL. What Denver does well is attacking the quarterback while protecting its own, ranking No. 1 in the league in sacks (55) this season, as well as being tied for the fewest sacks allowed (17).If Bo Nix has a clean pocket while Jordan Love is under constant pressure, that could open the door for an upset. The Broncos are also a perfect 6-0 straight-up at home this season.\nProjected score: Broncos 23, Packers 21The pick: Broncos +2.5\nIndianapolis Colts at Seattle SeahawksSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)I love the Philip Rivers return story. It's so wonderfully random, and I'm genuinely curious to see how he looks after not making a meaningful snap since January of 2021. If it is, in fact, Rivers that gets the nod, Sunday will mark 1,800 days between starts. Of course, that's a lot of time, and expecting Rivers to somehow keep it close against a Seattle defense that is second in the league in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per play allowed (4.5) and third down (33% conversion rate) seems too tall a task. As interesting as Rivers' comeback story is right now, it could be spoiled by halftime and downright sad by the fourth quarter.Projected score: Seahawks 30, Colts 16The pick: Seahawks -13.5Minnesota Vikings at Dallas CowboysSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC | Fubo, try for free)J.J. McCarthy showed some life against Washington last week, throwing for three touchdowns in a Vikings win. While that may have silenced some doubters momentarily, the jury is still out on the second-year signal-caller, who may have simply been the beneficiary of playing against arguably the worst defense in the NFL. \nDallas did regress last week, allowing 44 points to the Lions, but this defense is still better than what it was earlier in the year and simply ran into a buzzsaw headlined by Jahmyr Gibbs. It should look more like the ascending unit it was in the weeks leading up to that matchup with Detroit here, and I expect Quinnen Williams (eight quarterback hits in his four games with the Cowboys) to keep making his presence felt.Dallas is also 6-2 ATS in their past eight games following an ATS loss and 4-0 straight-up and ATS as a favorite on the \"Sunday Night Football\" stage over the past five seasons.Projected score: Cowboys 30, Vikings 17The pick: Cowboys -5.5Miami Dolphins at Pittsburgh SteelersMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC, ESPN | Fubo, try for free)The Dolphins have played much better in recent weeks, coming into Week 15 riding a four-game winning streak after a 2-7 start to the season. Defensive improvement has primarily sparked the win streak, as the unit is No. 1 in the league in points allowed (13.3), rushing yards per game (192.3) and turnover differential (+7).\nWith this momentum and Pittsburgh still not exactly looking like a legitimate contender (especially now that T.J. Watt is sidelined for this week), I think Miami can keep this within the number. Can it pull off the outright upset? That's where I stop short. Remember what time of year it is. The forecast for Monday's matchup at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh is expected to be about 19 degrees. The Dolphins have lost 13 straight games that were under 40 degrees at kickoff (including playoffs). The cover is in play, but that's about it.Projected score: Steelers 23, Dolphins 21The pick: Dolphins +3\n        \n            \n                Predicting the entire 2025 NFL playoff bracket and Super Bowl winner as we enter Week 15\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRest of the bunchCardinals at TexansProjected score: Texans 30, Cardinals 21The pick: Cardinals +9.5Bills at PatriotsProjected score: Patriots 27, Bills 24The pick: Patriots +1.5Browns at BearsProjected score: Bears 24, Browns 16The pick: Bears -7.5Chargers at ChiefsProjected score: Chargers 24, Chiefs 21The pick: Chargers +6Raiders at EaglesProjected score: Eagles 30, Raiders 17The pick: Raiders +12.5Jets at JaguarsProjected score: Jaguars 30, Jets 20The pick: Jets +13.5Commanders at GiantsProjected score: Giants 24, Commanders 21The pick: Giants -2.5\nPanthers at SaintsProjected score: Panthers 24, Saints 20The pick: Panthers -2.5Lions at RamsProjected score: Rams 30, Lions 27The pick: Lions +6Titans at 49ersProjected score: 49ers 33, Titans 17The pick: 49ers -12.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A pair of Pacific Northwest foes will meet to kick off the college football bowl game schedule on Saturday when Washington and Boise State duel in the LA Bowl. Despite their close proximity in bordering states, it is just the seventh all-time meeting between the programs, and it marks their third bowl game matchup. A 10-win season is on the line for the Broncos, who also seek the first win over a Big Ten program in their storied history. The Huskies, meanwhile, could end the second year of the Jedd Fisch era with a ninth win and build momentum towards what should be a highly anticipated Year 3. Boise State fell short of its quest for a repeat College Football Playoff berth, but it did secure a spot in the LA Bowl by way of winning the Mountain West Championship Game. The Broncos became the first team to ever win the conference three years in a row, and their seventh title is the most in league history. They closed their Mountain West membership on top and will join the new-look Pac-12 next season. Washington was a CFP hopeful, as well, but had its chances dashed when it lost to rival Oregon in the regular-season finale. It is more than a touchdown favorite, per FanDuel, to bounce back with a victory in bowl season.  Washington vs. Boise State: Need to know Three-headed monster: Boise State this season faced the impossible task of replacing Ashton Jeanty. Instead of putting the onus on one player, it nearly matched the former Heisman Trophy finalist's 2024 production with three prolific running backs. Dylan Riley, Sire Gaines and Malik Sherrod each racked up at least 400 rushing yards and six total touchdowns and modernized the Broncos' backfield as reliable receivers, as well. That trio combined for 2,752 yards from scrimmage in the regular season and conference championship game. Coleman does it all: Washington features a versatile running back of its own. Jonah Coleman, a CBS Sports Midseason All-American, scored a Big Ten-best 16 total touchdowns across 11 games in what has been the best campaign of his career. A knee injury limited him for all of November, but if he is closer to full strength for the LA Bowl, the senior is a sure bet to handle 15-20 touches and to find the end zone at least once. \nMVP Madsen: Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen missed three games and nearly all of a fourth with a lower leg injury but returned in grand fashion for the Mountain West title game. The second-year starter passed for three touchdowns and ran for another in one of his most productive games of the season and earned the conference championship game MVP award for his efforts. He should be in the lineup again Saturday. Husky defense flexes down the stretch: Washington boasts the more consistent defense of the two in this matchup, and it closed the regular season on a hot streak. While they did surrender 26 points to Oregon in the finale, none of the Huskies' three prior opponents put more than 14 points on the scoreboard. And not a single team this season -- yes, that includes Ohio State, Illinois, Michigan and Oregon -- notched more than three touchdowns in a game against the nation's No. 22 scoring defense.  Where to watch Washington vs. Boise State live Date: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 8 p.m. ET Location: SoFi Stadium -- Inglewood, California TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free) \n Washington vs. Boise State prediction, pick \nThe Mountain West is 3-1 straight up in the LA Bowl, and Boise State is catching 9.5 points. Conventional wisdom says to take the Broncos against the spread. This is not, however, the same caliber of Boise State team that made the CFP a year ago. The Broncos scored just seven total points in four different games this season, including in their lone matchup with a Power Four team (a 28-7 loss to Notre Dame). Washington, on the other hand, made light work of all of its non-Big Ten opponents and scored at least 38 points in the process. The star trio of Demond Willliams Jr., Denzel Boston and Coleman should lead the Huskies to a win by double digits.

    "body": "\n        Nau'Jour Grainger, also known as rapper Toosii, has a different understanding of his opportunity to play for Syracuse football ahead of the 2026 season. Weeks after committing to the Orange as part of Fran Brown's incoming recruiting class, Grainger said this week he has stepped away from the program after comments involving a \"walk-on\" opportunity from the Syracuse coach.\"No coach, that ain't what happened,\" Toosii said on TikTok. \"I told you I wasn't coming there no more, and you feel like you wanted to break the news first before I told people what school I was going to. (Brown) is a bozo for that.\"Born in Syracuse, Grainger moved to North Carolina as a teenager and began his music career. In 2020, his single \"Love Cycle\" went platinum, and his single \"Poetic Pain\" reached gold certification. In 2023, Grainger really flew up the charts when his single \"Favorite Song\" went viral on TikTok and reached double platinum certification.In high school, Grainger played wide receiver and returned kicks for Rolesville (N.C.) High. At 25 years old, the plan was for Grainger to play wideout next season.\nBrown said this month in reference to his 2026 roster that the plan was for Toosii to get an opportunity as a walk-on. Syracuse signed 18 transfers this cycle, including three pass-catchers.\"He's still thinking about it ... I'm not really sure if that will happen because we're getting more and more players on the football team,\" Brown said earlier this month.Toosii disputes Brown's take.\"That was never the conversation,\" Toosii said. \"The conversation was, 'Y'all paying for my school.' That's what it was. If you lie, I've got receipts.\"\nSince announcing his return to football in August and his decision to step away from his music career temporarily, Grainger visited NC State and Duke while receiving a scholarship offer from Sacramento State, according to 247Sports.Grainger originally committed to the Orange on. Dec. 1 after getting a call from Brown.\"For every kid who ever had a dream, make it reality,\" Brown wrote after committing. \"God's will is the way and no one can stop it not even the devil. I wanna thank my lord and savior Jesus Christ for even giving me the strength to chase what I believed when so many people told me I couldn't. Thank you to the people who supported me as well, it never go unnoticed. \n\"To be born in Syracuse and move to North Carolina at age 12 and haven't been back since. When Coach Fran called, I knew it was a sign from God. So with that being said, Cuse I'm coming home.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UFC 325 is set to go down in Australia this Saturday, making for a second consecutive weekend with a numbered UFC event. In the night's main event, featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski will face Diego Lopes in a rematch.Volkanovski won the first meeting at UFC 314 by unanimous decision. That win kicked off Volkanovski's second reign as champion after he'd dropped the title to Ilia Topuria in February 2024. Lopes bounced back with a massive win over Jean Silva in September by spinning back elbow. The Brazilian believes things will be different this time around. \"When I look back at the first fight, I know that I had big moments but I am grateful because the first fight with Volk taught me a lot of different things [about] my life and my career,\" Lopes told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"I fixed those things and now I am a completely different fighter compared to the first fight. Now, I have the experience [of] fighting five rounds and now I have the experience of being in the main event with the cameras behind me. Nothing is new for me now so I don't have the pressure.\"As with any UFC pay-per-view event, there's sure to be plenty of action at the sportsbook window, and with that in mind, we are taking a look at the best bet to make for every main card fight at UFC 325.\nSign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription!

Now we look ahead to this weekend, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.  Bet UFC 325 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nQuillan Salkilld\tvs.\tJamie MullarkeyQuillan Salkilld via KO/TKO/DQ (-145)Salkilld scored two massive knockouts in three 2025 victories, including the CBS Sports Knockout of the Year. Mullarkey is 4-4 since 2022, and he has been stopped by knockout or TKO in all four of his losses. Salkilld averages 1.3 more strikes landed per minute and absorbs nearly one less. All of that adds up to a fair chance that Salkilld scores yet another viral knockout to rile up his countrymen.Tai Tuivasa\tvs.\tTallison TeixeiraTallison Teixeira via KO/TKO/DQ (-225)Teixeira is coming off a disappointing TKO loss to Derrick Lewis on a somewhat questionable stoppage. That said, Tuivasa is on a five-fight losing skid and lacks the unique physical tools Teixeira has. Teixeira is a towering 6-foot-7, giving him a five-inch advantage in height over Tuivasa. Teixeira utilizes all four limbs well in his attack and that should allow him to bully Tuivasa both at distance and in the clinch. This seems like it will be Tuivasa's last ride in the UFC.Rafael Fiziev\tvs.\tMaurício RuffyRafael Fiziev moneyline (+100)Fiziev vs. Ruffy is a very even fight on paper, which means you have to find the little edges where the fight can be decided. Both men have power in their strikes, though Ruffy may be a little more fluid in his attack. But in Ruffy's most recent fight, a second-round submission loss to Benoit Saint Denis, he was taken down repeatedly and showed no ability to get off his back. Fiziev has never been a guy who focuses on his grappling, except that he has six takedowns in his two most recent fights. His team has no doubt planned for exploiting that weakness in Ruffy's game and that gives Fiziev enough of an edge to take him in this pick'em fight.\nDan Hooker\tvs.\tBenoit Saint DenisBenoit Saint Denis via KO/TKO/DQ or Submission (-130)Saint Denis suffered a pair of brutal back-to-back losses to Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano in 2024 but has rebounded with three impressive victories. Hooker represents the exact kind of opponent that Saint Denis can unload his entire game on. Hooker is very wide-open in his attack, absorbing as many significant strikes as he lands per minute and with good, but not great, takedown defense. Saint Denis averages nearly five takedowns per 15 minutes, while Hooker defends takedowns at 77%. Saint Denis should be able to take advantage of Hooker's defensive holes, both in striking and in grappling. Once Saint Denis gets rolling, he should be able to find a finish against Hooker, who has seven stoppage losses in his career.Alexander Volkanovski vs.\tDiego LopesAlexander Volkanovski moneyline (-148)I struggle to see any reason why this rematch looks much different from the first meeting. Volkanovski is one of the craftiest fighters of the era, rarely making mistakes. There's no shame in losing to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria, who may be the two best fighters on the planet. Is Lopes in that group? I don't believe so. Lopes is good enough to get the win, as he showed when he hurt Volkanovski late in their first meeting. But Volkanovski is the better all-around fighter, and he is the favorite for a reason. We'll roll with Volkanovski to repeat his victory and continue to build his resume as one of the greatest featherweights in history.Who wins Volkanovski vs. Lopes, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's time to kick off one of the best times of year for wrestling fans. The Road to WrestleMania gets underway on Saturday night in Saudi Arabia when WWE takes the Royal Rumble to Riyadh. One of the promotion's tentpole events, the Royal Rumble began running annually in 1988. It presents the 30 participants with the opportunity to be in a championship match at WrestleMania. Last year saw an incredible bit of theater in the men's match as it came down to Jey Uso and John Cena, who was participating in his final Royal Rumble amid his retirement tour. Uso managed to finish things off by tossing Cena over the top rope and he capped it off by besting Gunther for the world heavyweight title in April.Plus, a returning Charlotte Flair managed to be the last woman standing to punch her ticket to WrestleMania after more than a year away with a knee injury. While there are some superstars who have declared their entry into the over-the-top-rope elimination match, there's always a handful of surprises fans don't see coming between both the men's and women's matches.\nThis year's winners are anyone's guess with star-studded fields expected for both matches.\n        \n            \n                WWE burning questions for the Road to WrestleMania 42: Who wins the Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber and more\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere are two supporting matches to the card on Saturday. One is a world title match between undisputed WWE champion Drew McIntyre and Sami Zayn. McIntyre finally got over the hump and bested Rhodes in Three Stages of Hell earlier this month to claim the title. Now he takes on a familiar foe who he is undefeated against in singles competition in Zayn, who just so happens to also have never held a world title. Take a look below at the confirmed matches for the Royal Rumble as well as our staff picks and predictions for each match. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited with the main card starting at 2 p.m. ET.\n2026 WWE Royal Rumble matchesMen's Royal  Rumble match -- Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, Gunther, Jey Uso, Rey Mysterio, Jacob Fatu, Solo Sikoa, Dragon Lee, Penta, Bron Breakker, Logan Paul, Bronson Reed, Austin Theory, Je'Von Evans, Oba Femi, Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar and 13 more: The match already has a who's who of entrants that we know. There's five surefire Hall of Famers, former world champions and plenty of upstart talent set to participate. Be on the look out for The Vision and the four members who are set to enter. They could pose a united front and take out much of the field.Undisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: McIntyre learned the identity of his first title challenger at Saturday Night's Main Event. Randy Orton, Trick Williams, Damian Priest and Zayn met in a No. 1 contender's match after winning their qualifying matches. Zayn stood tall in Montreal, catching Priest with a Helluva Kick to punch his ticket to the Rumble. Zayn has never won a world title in WWE, and has made it his mission to change his fortunes this year.Women's Royal Rumble match -- Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, Roxanne Perez, Liv Morgan, Raquel Rodriguez, Bayley, Lyra Valkyria, Asuka, Chelsea Green, Jordynne Grace, Charlotte Flair, Alexa Bliss, Nia Jax, Lash Legend, Giulia, Maxxine Dupri, Becky Lynch and 13 more: The women's Rumble is stacked. Eight former women's world champions are among the 15 superstars currently announced for the match. Expect more stars to throw their names into the hat before the Rumble begins.\nAJ Styles vs. Gunther: Gunther is turning into a new age Legend Killer. Last year, \"The Ring General\" retired both John Cena and Goldberg. He wants to do the same to Styles. \"The Phenomenal\" one previously announced he'd retire in 2026, but Gunther hopes to expedite the process. Gunther stole a victory from Styles on Monday Night Raw, and only granted him a rematch under the condition that Styles retires if he loses at the Rumble.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two superstars will change their fortunes at the WWE Royal Rumble. On Saturday, one man and one woman will secure world title matches at WrestleMania 42. Every year, the Royal Rumble jump-starts the Road to WrestleMania. Superstars throw each other over the top rope with hopes of winning the Rumble. This year, Cody Rhodes seeks to become only the second superstar to win three Rumbles, a feat achieved only by \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. Last year saw an incredible bit of theater in the men's match as it came down to Jey Uso and John Cena, who was participating in his final Royal Rumble amid his retirement tour.

Breakker is very clearly positioned to challenge CM Punk for the world heavyweight championship at WrestleMania. While Oba Femi might be the man who has the standout Rumble performance, Breakker has the backing of The Vision, who has agreed to help Breakker get the win. It's not the most shocking outcome, but it makes plenty of sense to set up a big match for WrestleMania. Pick: Breakker wins -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)\nWomen's Royal Rumble match: Where is Belair? She contributed to the best match of WrestleMania 41 weekend, a women's world title match with Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky. During the match, she suffered a finger injury that sidelined her for over eight months. In July, Belair told CBS Sports that she was at \"the tail end of this healing process,\" but we still haven't seen her wrestle. She re-entered the women's world title scene on the road to WrestleMania last year. I cross my fingers that she does the same this year as a surprise entrant. Pick: Belair wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse) Undisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: Sometimes, you have to just look at a match and think, \"Hey, why not?\" It's fairly clear that Zayn will eventually have a run with a world title, and this is an easy opportunity to put the title on him for a month or two before taking it off of him ahead of WrestleMania. It probably makes sense to keep the title on McIntyre, but if we aren't going to get surprising Rumble winners, why not a surprising title change? Pick: Zayn wins -- BrookhouseMcIntyre and Zayn both deserve solid world title reigns, but the defending champ deserves it slightly more. This version of McIntyre has repeatedly fallen short, or had his reign ended the same night it started. McIntyre must win his first title defense, especially amid his feuds with Rhodes and Fatu. I'm not sure McIntyre enters WrestleMania, let alone leaves it, with the undisputed WWE title, but he should hold it past the Rumble. Pick: McIntyre wins -- Mahjouri  \nAJ Styles vs. Gunther: Do I want Gunther to win? No. I want Styles, my all-time favorite professional wrestler, to deny a loss that would see him retire. I want him to steal Gunther's Rumble spot and win the 30-man match, 10 years after he debuted at the same event, before he retires in 2026. I want him to headline WrestleMania and further his phenomenal legacy. The story is right there. Sometimes the obvious decision is the right one, but I'm not confident WWE will see it through. Reports about creative shake-ups inspire some hope, but not enough to pick against the modern-day legend killer. Pick: Gunther wins -- Mahjouri  Styles isn't going to lose a retirement match. Sure, they could do a rerun of the referee missing Gunther tapping out only for Gunther to win and then reverse the decision on Raw, but that feels unnecessarily complicated. Rather than jumping through unnecessary hoops, Styles should just get the win and continue along his final year as an active wrestler. Pick: Styles wins -- Brookhouse  \n            ",

He was honored by topping the promotion's pound-for-pound rankings in both 2022 and 2023, and at one point he had an 11-fight win streak within the featherweight division. While he has just a 2-3 record over his last five bouts, two of those came when Volkanovski stepped up in weight class and challenged Islam Makhachev for the UFC Lightweight Championship, losing both bouts to Makhachev.The other defeat saw the Aussie drop the featherweight title to Ilia Topuria in Feb. 2024. However, he then won the vacant UFC Featherweight Championship in his next bout, which was the first match with Lopes. Volkanovski won via unanimous decision as he landed more than twice as many significant strikes (158) than his opponent landed total strikes (71). That was the 11th decision victory of Volkanovski's MMA career, as he also has 13 KOs and three submission triumphs. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 31-year-old Lopes has youth on his side versus Volkanovski, in addition to five inches over his 5-foot-6 opponent. A native of Brazil, Lopes has a BJJ background and signed with UFC in 2023. After dropping his first fight, he then went on a five-bout winning streak, earning Performance of the Night twice during that span. That led to his first title shot versus Volkanovski at UFC 314 in April 2025, and though the Brazilian came up short, the bout was awarded Fight of the Night.\nWhile Volkanovski has been idle since then, Lopes took a fight against Jean Silva, a fellow Brazilian who was ranked and had recorded five straight finish victories. Lopes prevailed in that September 2025 bout via TKO with a spinning elbow and punches. That was his 11th knockout victory, to go along with 12 submissions and four wins via decision. Neither Lopes nor Volkanovski have ever lost via submission, though both have tasted defeat by knockout and on the scorecards.

    "body": "\n        If this year's Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks is even half as good as the last time these two franchises met on this stage, it will be a wild ride. Eleven years after a Super Bowl XLIX thriller, the teams meet again with the Lombardi Trophy on the line.The Seahawks, similar to their previous Super Bowl trips, have been powered by one of the NFL's best defenses. Seattle allowed the fewest points in the league this season and finished first in yards per pass attempt allowed and yards per rush attempt allowed. The defense flexed its muscle in Seattle's 41-6 divisional-round win over the San Francisco 49ers, allowing a paltry 3.9 yards per play -- San Francisco's worst mark all season.But it was the offense that stepped up most in the NFC Championship Game. Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams, with 153 yards and a touchdown going to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Kenneth Walker III had 111 yards from scrimmage and a score, and Cooper Kupp and Jake Bobo also found the end zone.Though the offense was hit-or-miss down the stretch of the regular season, it seems to have found its footing in the playoffs and, crucially, has zero turnovers. Overall, Seattle has a plus-four turnover differential this postseason.\nSpeaking of turnovers, no one has forced more than New England this postseason, and it's not particularly close. The Patriots' defense has absolutely wreaked havoc, first against the Los Angeles Chargers, then the Houston Texans and finally, in the AFC Championship Game, the Denver Broncos. The Patriots' 8.7 points per game allowed is the fewest by any team through three playoff games since the vaunted 2000 Baltimore Ravens defense.The Patriots offense, which powered much of the team's regular-season success, hasn't fared as well. New England's 18.0 postseason points per game is the fewest entering a Super Bowl appearance since the 1979 Rams. Still, Drake Maye has made several big plays -- both with his arm and his legs -- and New England's firepower will certainly be a major test for Seattle's defense.Here's how to watch the game, followed by keys to the contest and a prediction.Super Bowl 60: Where to watch Seahawks vs. PatriotsDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)Halftime performer: Bad BunnyTV: NBC | Live stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppBetting odds: Seahawks -4.5 | O/U 45.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook)Patriots-Seahawks Super Bowl big questionsCan the Patriots force Sam Darnold into mistakes? For as good as Darnold has been this season -- and especially this postseason -- he does have a penchant for turnovers. In fact, his 20 turnovers this season were most in the NFL, and his 14 interceptions were third-most. Eight of those 14 turnovers happened when he was pressured, tied with Geno Smith for most in the NFL.\nNow (mostly) healthy, the Patriots' pass rush has been dominant this postseason with an NFL-best 52% pressure rate. For comparison's sake, the highest pressure rate during the regular season was 45% (by the Minnesota Vikings). The Seahawks have done a good job keeping Darnold clean for the most part, and play-caller Klint Kubiak does a good job of getting him out of the pocket via play-action and giving him easy answers. But Milton Williams, who had a big impact in last year's Super Bowl for the Philadelphia Eagles, K'Lavon Chaisson and other members of the New England front seven will hope to make an impact so talented cornerbacks Christian Gonzalez and Carlton Davis have a chance to make Darnold pay for a poor decision.\nCan the Patriots' offensive line hold up?The path for the underdogs to come out on top starts with getting to Darnold. The next step is protecting their own quarterback. Maye has taken five sacks in all three of his playoff games so far, and while that's come against three of the NFL's best defenses, it's not as if the Seahawks' unit is any easier. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald dials up a variety of different schemes and pressure looks, and he has both a disruptive duo inside (Leonard Williams, Byron Murphy II) and a plethora of edge rushers to generate pressure. When the Seahawks do get pressure, Maye has to be careful with the ball: He has six fumbles (three lost) this postseason, both most of any player.\nCan Maye hit the deep ball?The Seahawks' excellent cornerbacks play very aggressively, and it almost always works. The results speak for themselves.But if the offensive line holds up, Maye might have the opportunity for a deep ball or two, and he's been as good as anyone in those scenarios: His 35 completions at least 20 yards downfield this regular season were second-most in the NFL behind Matthew Stafford.Super Bowl 60 pick, prediction\nExpect some nerves early, especially from the quarterbacks, but as both settle in, this should be a great, close battle between an ascending star and an unlikely one.\nMaye is looking to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and Darnold is looking to become the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl after playing for at least five different teams.Ultimately, the Seahawks' defense gets a few timely stops, and Seattle leaves with its second championship.Pick: Seahawks 24, Patriots 20\n            ",

But an honest Lopes, who still managed to drop Volkanovski, admitted after the fight that he failed to follow his corner's gameplan and got caught simply following his opponent around in hopes of a knockout. Expect a more seasoned and more dangerous Lopes in the rematch. Not only did he rely on grappling and the traps he set with striking to ultimately finish Jean Silva last September, he has been working relentlessly on rounding out his game. If Lopes does a better job cutting off the cage and using both his size and the threat of the takedown to make the 37-year-old Volkanovski feel his age, this should be a very different fight. And while Volkanovski's chin did hold up during their first fight despite having been fresh off of back-to-back knockout losses, his time at the top may be running out. Lopes via TKO3Brookhouse: It's hard to believe that this fight plays out much differently than the first fight unless Volkanovski has aged considerably in the past year. Yes, 37 is old for a fighter, especially a featherweight, but Volkanovski is a uniquely skilled tactician in his ability to not only prepare, but execute a gameplan. I don't see any reason to think that losses to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria signal a fighter is \"done\" at an elite level, simply that he ran into two of the best fighters on the planet in their prime. Lopes doesn't have a reliable takedown game, which means that this is a striking battle, and Volkanovski is great at working angles and finding timing. Yes, Lopes did hurt Volkanovski in the first fight, but that came in between Volkanovski clearly controlling the rest of the action. I simply don't believe that Lopes can out-gameplan and outexecute Volkanovski. Volkanovski via UDMahjouri: If this fight were a year from now, I'd pick Lopes in a heartbeat. The challenger has every physical advantage over the champ: height, reach, durability, and power. Lopes' inexperience cost him the first fight. Volkanovski showcased why he's a featherweight GOAT. He controlled the lead outside foot positioning, feinted brilliantly, and significantly outstruck Lopes. The champ pitched a near-perfect game, yet still gave up one or two rounds to Lopes' power. That's the worry here. Lopes' physical gifts will become a bigger factor as he narrows the technical gaps. The question is whether Lopes can cover enough distance in nine months to beat Volkanovski. It will be a much closer second fight, but Volkanovski should have enough in the tank to win a narrow decision. Volkanovski via UD\nMormile: Volkanovski UDWise: Volkanovski via UDDan Hooker vs. Benoit Saint Denis predictionsCampbell: Reformed following a pair of TKO defeats, Saint Denis has looked like a completely different fighter in three walks to the Octagon under the tutelage of new coach Nicholas Ott, which produced a trio of stoppage wins in 2025. The task at hand against Hooker on Saturday will be for 'BSD' to ignore the urge to throw caution to the wind off the start and get into a full-blown slugfest. Saint Denis is at his best when he balances patience and grappling with the threat of his powerful striking. And considering Hooker was finished in less than two rounds by Arman Tsarukyan just two months ago, this could be the perfect catapult for the French \"God of War\" to score a systematic stoppage victory and enter the top five at 155 pounds. Hooker is always game for battle, but his one-dimensional style has caught up with him on the elite level. Saint Denis via KO2Brookhouse: Saint Denis via SUB2Mahjouri: Hooker has no designs on changing his style. He's hell-bent on action, and it'll cost him against on Saturday. Neither man has perfect durability, but Hooker has more wear and tear. That's concerning against Saint Denis, the younger and arguably more powerful fighter. Saint Denis looks revitalized working with top middleweight contender Nassourine Imavov. The French special forces soldier has the natural gifts and evolving skillset to make short work of Hooker. It's imperative, however, that he doesn't abandon his defense. Hooker can still crack and will catch Saint Denis if he's not careful. Saint Denis via KO2Mormile: Saint Denis via submissionWise: Saint Denis via TKO3Rafael Fiziev vs. Mauricio Ruffy predictionsCampbell: Urgency is the name of the game in this top 15 matchup at lightweight as both fighters can desperately use a big win to further propel themselves back into contention. Ruffy, who suffered a humbling submission defeat at the hands of Saint Denis last September in a fight that exposed his lack of a grappling game, moved from the Fighting Nerds camp in Brazil to train with Volkanovski in Australia. Fiziev, meanwhile, who snapped a three-fight losing skid last June when he took a decision from Ignacio Bahamondes, is finally healthy and looking to put a pair of decision defeats to new interim champion Justin Gaethje behind him. That means this fight has all the potential to be a fun striking match over three rounds and one that is very evenly contested. If Ruffy can add the threat of wrestling, it could be the difference. Ruffy via UD\nBrookhouse: If anyone can add wrestling threats to this fight, it's Fiziev. Ruffy has never scored a takedown in the UFC and he was taken down three times while being dominated by Saint Denis. Fiziev, meanwhile, has scored six takedowns in his two most recent fights, including two against Justin Gaethje. In a fairly even battle of strikers, though Ruffy may be a bit more dynamic in his angles and shot selection, one fighter having the edge in grappling is enough to tilt the fight on paper. While either man could catch the other on the feet, Fiziev's new confidence in his wrestling gives me some comfort in siding with him. Fiziev via UDMahjouri: This might be an even more compelling action fight than the co-main event. Fiziev and Ruffy are on the cusp of entering the lightweight elite. Fiziev is a first-class Muay Thai striker with an improving wrestling game. Ruffy, a textbook KO artist, recently migrated from the Fighting Nerds to featherweight champ Volkanovski's camp. I was prepared to count Fiziev out, but I think he's a victim of bad luck. His three UFC losses are a majority decision to Justin Gaethje, a freak knee injury against Mateusz Gamrot and a close rematch against Gaethje, which he took on two weeks' notice after a year-and-a-half layoff from the aforementioned injury. Fiziev showed signs of life in a bounce-back win against Ignacio Bahamondes, complementing his striking with newfound wrestling. Ruffy might revolutionize himself with Team Volkanovski, but I'll need to see the results before assessing his future.

    "body": "\n        College football's elites could face their toughest conference schedules ever in 2026. The SEC has long been a gauntlet, but with the debut of a nine-game conference slate this season, there will be fewer opportunities to catch a breather. Meanwhile, in the Big Ten, a deeper and more competitive top tier means its projected contenders face a more challenging path through conference play than in previous years.There's been a common narrative that Big Ten teams don't get worn down the way SEC teams do late in the season -- and there is some truth to it. The numbers back it up: in 2023, before any major conference realignment took effect, Big Ten teams that finished inside the top 30 of Bill Connelly's SP+ ratings played, on average, three league opponents that were also in the top 30 at the end of the season. SEC teams meeting the same criteria faced between four and five.Looking ahead to 2026, the SEC's nine-game conference schedule could see projected top teams -- based on Brandon Marcello's way-too-early rankings -- facing anywhere from five to eight games against other potential top-30-caliber opponents just in conference play. The Big Ten, while not at the same intensity, will still have its projected best teams regularly facing three to five top-30-caliber conference opponents.Top-30 vs. Top-30: Average conference matchups per team (final SP+)YearBig TenSEC20232.84.320243.35.120254.04.72026*4.36.4* Based on Brandon Marcello's way-too-early rankings with teams considered includedThese numbers reflect not just a steady increase in marquee games, but a more demanding path to the College Football Playoff.  Instead of two or three Saturdays that truly define a season, top teams are playing tougher opponents more often. There are fewer recovery games, fewer built-in breathers and fewer chances to reset after a tough matchup.That shift is especially clear in the Big Ten. Each of the five highest-ranked teams in Marcello's way-too-early 2026 projections faces at least three of the other four.Ohio State alone is slated to face all four, including a punishing four-week stretch: a trip to No. 8 Indiana, a bye, a cross-country trip to No. 11 USC, then back home to face No. 4 Oregon. The regular-season finale against No. 9 Michigan still looms. Add in a non-conference trip to No. 2 Texas, and the Buckeyes expect to face one of the most grueling slates in the country next season.Indiana and Oregon each have back-to-back games against Ohio State and Michigan on their respective 2026 schedules. Those top-heavy stretches give teams little room for error.The SEC schedule tells a different story, but the effect is similar. The nine-game conference slate drives difficulty through sheer volume. Of the six highest-ranked SEC teams in Marcello's projections, five play at least three other conference opponents in that group.Texas A&M, for instance, will face four of the other projected top teams: No. 2 Texas, No. 10 Oklahoma, No. 14 LSU and No. 15 Alabama. Oklahoma, which already faced one of the toughest conference schedules in its first two years in the league, will face eight of the 10 other SEC teams ranked or considered in Marcello's projections, including each of the three above it: No. 2 Texas, No. 3 Georgia and No. 6 Texas A&M. That doesn't even factor in the nonconference road trip to No. 9 Michigan in Week 2.Georgia's schedule is slightly lighter, with only two of the other top teams -- No. 10 Oklahoma and No. 15 Alabama -- but it still includes several additional high-end matchups.This isn't the result of conferences suddenly trying to make schedules harsher. Both leagues simply house more legitimate contenders than they used to. When more top-tier programs occupy the same competitive space, difficulty rises naturally -- even when schedules are built with balance in mind.\nIt's worth reiterating that these numbers are projections for the 2026 season, based on way-too-early rankings and schedules; the actual outcomes could differ significantly once the season actually plays out.Still, the trend toward tougher schedules could mean fewer unbeaten conference campaigns. In the two seasons since realignment, the Big Ten saw three teams finish unbeaten in league play, while the SEC hasn't had any.In the Big Ten, that effect is amplified by timing. Future opponents for the 2024-28 seasons were set in October 2023, before Oregon, USC, UCLA and Washington officially joined the conference and before Indiana became a national power.\nIn the SEC, the mechanism is simpler. A nine-game conference slate increases difficulty through volume alone. More league games in a conference already dense with strong programs naturally produces more high-end matchups.It's also another sign that the top of college football has thickened, and that simply means elite teams face tougher schedules.\n            ",

Epstein, who died by suicide in a federal jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in August 2019, directly communicated with Tisch in the correspondence. Epstein appeared to be not only scouting women for Tisch but also facilitating introductions between women and Tisch. The two also exchanged follow-up commentary after meetings.In several email exchanges, Epstein and Tisch discussed whether women were \"pro or civilian\" or a \"working girl.\" Epstein sent descriptions of women's backgrounds, appearances and personalities, and in some cases, followed up with reports on such meetings. Tisch responded to a number of those messages.Tisch released a statement to Ralph Vacchiano of Fox Sports on his appearance in the Epstein files.\"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments,\" Tisch said. \"I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"Tisch, a film producer responsible for the likes of \"Forrest Gump\" and \"American History X,\" took his role with the Giants in 2005. Epstein, a former banker, has faced charges of human trafficking, child sex offenses and serial rape.\nThere are three primary periods of communication between Tisch and Epstein uncovered in the DOJ release.May 2013Emails show Epstein communicating with Tisch, who was attending NFL meetings. After Tisch replied that he was, \"Still in NFL meeting,\" Epstein suggested arranging a meeting with a woman he identified as Russian. Tisch responded minutes later by asking, \"Is she fun?\" The exchange continued that afternoon.June 2013Emails show Tisch asking Epstein directly about specific women. In one exchange, Epstein described a woman as \"exotic,\" noting she spoke mostly French. Tisch replied by asking, \"Working girl?\" Epstein responded, \"Never.\"In a separate exchange, Tisch asked, \"Is my present in NYC?\" Epstein replied, \"Yes.\" Tisch followed up the next morning, asking, \"Can I get my surprise to take me to lunch tomorrow?\"In another exchange, Epstein described a woman in explicit terms, noting she had a \"10 ass,\" and encouraged Tisch to contact her. Tisch replied, \"Thanks Jeffrey,\" and asked about another woman, inquiring as to whether she was \"pro or civilian?\" Epstein responded that she was a \"civilian,\" adding further personal commentary.Epstein sent messages offering detailed commentary after meetings had taken place. In one follow-up, Epstein wrote that Tisch \"did very well,\" adding that the woman was \"a little freaked by the age difference\" and advising him to \"go slow.\" Epstein also referenced attempting to influence her not to return to Ukraine, writing that \"having her crying worked.\" Tisch replied, \"Nice report … Funny comment on crying!!!\"September 2013Emails show social exchanges between Epstein and Tisch tied to the Giants. Tisch offered Epstein two tickets to his suite for a game and invited him to attend other games during the season. Epstein, in turn, invited Tisch to visit him on his private island in the Caribbean, though the emails do not indicate whether Tisch accepted.In another exchange, Epstein wrote to Tisch that he was \"happy to have you as a new but … shared interest friend.\"In 1991, Tisch's family purchased a 50% stake in the Giants franchise. He has accepted the Vince Lombardi Trophy on behalf of the organization following Super Bowl victories after the 2007 and 2011 seasons. His brother, Jonathan Tisch, serves as the team's treasurer.\nThe DOJ has said the release of communications involving Epstein is part of an effort to make previously undisclosed materials public, noting that a person's inclusion in the documents does not, by itself, indicate criminal conduct. The department has come under fire for the delayed release of these files as it missed a Dec. 19, 2025, deadline established by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

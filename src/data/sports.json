Lamar Jackson is back (for real this time). After last week's win and improved defensive performance, the Ravens looked poised to hit the accelerator and jump right back into the AFC North picture. When playing on a short week, Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel is 0-4 SU and 1-3 ATS, losing by an average of 14 ppg,\" SportsLine NFL handicapper Daniel Vithlani said. \"I feel that Miami's win over Atlanta last week was more of a 'dead cat bounce' than a sign of real hope. The Falcons are disappearing artists. Baltimore's healthy offense can exploit Miami's 31st DVOA ranked defense to get their mojo going. The last time Tua Tagovailoa faced the Ravens, he threw 2 interceptions in a game that Baltimore won 56-19.\"Bet Dolphins vs. Ravens at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses: More NFL best betsEvery NFL game simulated 10,000 timesThursday NBA best betsGame: San Antonio Spurs vs. Miami Heat (8:30 p.m. ET)The Pick: Miami Heat +6.5 (-118)\"We're keeping a very close eye on both of these sides, especially the Heat, who have been one of the big surprises of the first week as they've won three straight and covered their last four into tonight. The offseason add of Norman Powell (24 ppg) from the Clippers is looking a very shrewd bit of business as he's seamlessly picked up the role of Terry Rozier,\" legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"There are six others besides Powell scoring in double digits, too. Meanwhile, there's nothing bad to say about the Spurs, who are winging at 5-0 and doing so minus De'Aaron Fox and Jeremy Sochan, each due back soon. Still, we'd rather take the available points with a surging Miami and ride this bandwagon.\"Bet Spurs vs. Heat at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager and three months of NBA League Pass free:More NBA best betsEvery NBA game simulated 10,000 timesThursday college football best betsGame: UTSA vs. Tulane (7:30 p.m. ET)The Pick: UTSA +6 (-110)Tulane is off to a 6-1 start and has a win over a power conference opponent (Duke) under its belt.

However, the Roadrunners hung tough with Texas A&M (the only unbeaten in the SEC) and hammered Rice 61-13 in their last home game.

With the Pirates, Shelton went 306-440 (.410) with two last-place finishes and two fourth-place finishes in his four full seasons on the job. He previously served as the bench coach for the Twins under Paul Molitor in 2018 and Rocco Baldelli in 2019.Shelton took over a team deep in a rebuilding phase -- a phase that still hasn't yielded much in the way of wins at the big-league level -- and the team showed incremental improvement on his watch until they stalled out in 2024 and for the early weeks of this season. As a player, Shelton spent two minor league seasons as a catcher and first baseman in the New York Yankees system but never rose above Single-A. \nAs for the Twins, they're coming off a 2025 season in which they went 70-92 and placed fourth in the American League Central. That plus an 82-80 record and another fourth-place finish in 2024 cost Badelli his job in late September of this year. In all, Baldelli guided the Twins to three playoff berths in his seven seasons on the job. While there is some talent in place in Minnesota, Shelton walks into an uncertain ownership situation, especially when it comes to a top-down willingness to invest in payroll.\nWith Shelton's hiring in Minnesota, three MLB teams remain in need of a manager for the 2026 season: the San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies, and Atlanta Braves. \n            \n    ",

He is back healthy and looking to show he's still an All-Star talent, averaging 26.3 points, 9.5 assists, 8.2 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game in the team's first four contests. As a team, Charlotte is off to a 2-2 start and hoping to take some strides to get back into the East's Play-In race this year. \nIf Ball remains healthy and continue playing at this level, they have a good chance to be in the playoff hunt. He will want to find some different ways to vent after a call he doesn't like unless he wants to continue making charitable donations via fines. \n            \n    ",

Then there's also Oklahoma vs. Tennessee (-3) and Texas vs. Vanderbilt (+2.5) as newer conference matchups, as those, along with Cincinnati vs. Utah (-10) are the lone three ranked matchups this week.Teams don't have to play in the same conference to have a rivalry in between them, as Army vs. Air Force can attest.

The Irish have the rest advantage in coming off a bye, and they're 10-2 against the spread (ATS) over their last 12 post-bye games. The Irish also have the momentum advantage with a five-game win streak, compared to BC dropping its last seven contests. The Eagles are 1-5 ATS over their last six and were trounced, 44-0, by Notre Dame last season, which was the Irish's ninth straight victory in this series. Add in that Boston College ranks 136th out of 139 FBS teams in scoring defense, and the Irish cover well over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: No. 7 Ole Miss (-12.5, 55.5) covers against South Carolina in over 50% of simulations Saturday at 7 p.m. ET. Ole Miss is coming off a 34-26 win over then-No. 13 Oklahoma and the Sooners top-ranked SEC scoring defense. OU was allowing just 9.4 points prior to that defeat as the Rebels have scored at least 24 in every games. As for the Gamecocks, their 20.4 points rank last in the SEC, and they are 1-5 both over their last six games and within conference play. Preseason Heisman candidate, LaNorris Sellers, has just four touchdown passes across six SEC games, and USC, as a whole, constantly shoots itself in the foot as it commits the seventh-most penalties per game in all of FBS.

    "body": "\n        Tiger Woods has not played in a competitive golf tournament since the 2024 Open Championship amid a variety of injuries, but that does not mean the golf world has slowed down trying to pinpoint his next outing. In fact, there's a legitimate possibility the next competitive tournament Woods plays is on PGA Tour Champions, not the PGA Tour he has dominated since his youth.Woods turns 50 on Dec. 30, which will make him eligible for the senior circuit, a reality lost neither on the league nor its leader.\"Yes, we're ready. We're well prepared,\" PGA Tour Champions president Miller Brady told Golf Channel. \"We've done some whiteboarding over the past year in preparation for Tiger turning 50. And if and when he plays, our tournaments are prepared.\"It is going to be more: security, buses, portalets, concession stands -- all of that is taken into account when we plan for that.\"\nWoods announced in October that he required a seventh back surgery due to a collapsed lumbar disc. No timetable for return was mentioned as the procedure was handled while the 15-time major champion was already recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon in his left leg, which occurred before the 2025 Masters.While Woods has not played in an official event since the 2024 Open, he did tee it up in the PNC Championship last December alongside his son, Charlie. The duo lost in a playoff. The 36-hole scramble grants Woods and other players the ability to use a golf cart -- a feature allowed on PGA Tour Champions every tournament.Playing in all four 2024 majors -- Woods finished 60th in the Masters, missing the cut in the other three -- it was clear that his greatest struggle was physically walking the courses. This difficulty stemmed from a 2021 motor vehicle crash in which Woods required emergency surgery to repair multiple breaks in his tibia and fibula.\nIn the three years that followed, Woods competed in eight majors, playing the weekend twice (2022 Masters, 2024 Masters), withdrawing from two tournaments and missing four cuts.Further aiding Tiger's ability to compete on PGA Tour Champions is a shortened playing format. The tournaments are contested across 54 holes instead of the 72. With one less round to play and with less stress on his lower body from use of the golf cart, Woods may be able to seriously compete on PGA Tour Championships when he decides to tee it up between majors.\"To be honest with you, given the last surgery, I just hope Tiger gets back on his feet and is able to play golf again,\" Brady continued.\nWhile Woods will not be playing, he posted on social media that he plans to attend every match for his Jupiter Links Golf Club in the TGL during its second season. The simulator league's campaign kicks off at the end of December with Jupiter Links' first match set for Jan. 13, 2026.\n            ",

Should your Week 9 NFL picks include Mahomes, Allen, Travis Kelce or James Cook as part of your NFL DFS strategy, within Fantasy football lineups or among NFL player props? Other close spreads include Bears vs. Bengals (+3), Colts vs. Steelers (+3), Jaguars vs. Raiders (+2.5) and Seahawks vs. Commanders (+3) on Sunday night.

R.J. White, who is 37-15-3 (+2114) over his last 55 ATS picks in Vikings games, is backing Detroit (-8.5) to cover versus Minnesota. \"[J.J. McCarthy] was terrible for seven of his eight quarters played prior to missing six weeks with a high ankle sprain, and now he returns against a Lions defense that should be more whole in the secondary than the unit that shut down the Bucs two weeks ago. The Vikings defense struggled to stop Kimani Vidal, so I don't like their chances against the Lions' star RB duo. This feels like a game the Lions should lead by double-digits by the third quarter, and I don't like McCarthy's chances of getting a backdoor cover.\" White's NFL best bets for Week 9 can be found here.Eric Cohen, who is 79-41-1 (66%) on his straight-up NFL picks this season, has exact score predictions for all 14 games in Week 9. He is high on the Steelers (+3, 49.5) to upset the Colts, 26-24, on Sunday. Hit any of his exact score picks and you're looking at a payout well over 100-1. That pick, along with his prediction for every game, is available here.Ravens vs. Dolphins 'Thursday Night Football' picksA pair of two-win teams coming off much-needed wins will kick off NFL Week 9 as Miami hosts Baltimore on 'Thursday Night Football.' Lamar Jackson (hamstring) will return after missing three games, and the Ravens are 7.5-point road favorites. SportsLine expert Mike Tierney, who is 29-14-1 (+1327) over his last 44 picks in Ravens games, is backing the Under (50.5) to hit. The SportsLine model has also made spread, money line and over/under picks, including one that hits in almost 70% of simulations. See Dolphins vs. Ravens picks from the advanced model here.Seahawks vs. Commanders 'Sunday Night Football' picksAfter losing on MNF last week, Washington will look to right the ship on SNF versus Seattle (-3.5, 46.5) coming off a bye. These teams have alternated wins and losses over their last six regular season games, with the Seahawks prevailing in their last meeting. The SportsLine model projects Jaxon Smith-Njigba to top all receivers in Week 9 in Fantasy football points. It has also spread, money line and total picks for 'Sunday Night Football'. See the Commanders vs. Seahawks picks from the advanced model here.Cowboys vs. Cardinals 'Monday Night Football' picksKyler Murray is expected to return on MNF in a homecoming game as the Dallas native and the Cardinals visit the Cowboys (-2.5). Arizona is 7-1 versus Dallas over their last eight matchups including three straight wins in Dallas. This game has the highest total (54) of the Week 9 NFL schedule, and the advanced model from SportsLine has the Over hitting, with the teams combining for 59 points. SportsLine's No. 1 NFL expert R.J. White has made his spread pick, and even though both teams enter off losses, White says the unit of one team is coming off \"its best game of the season.\" See White's Cardinals vs. Commanders picks here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Derrick Henry is about to go where only 16 other rushers have gone before. The Baltimore Ravens running back enters Week 9 with 11,933 career rushing yards, meaning he's just 67 yards away from reaching the 12,000-yard threshold. That is a hallowed number in NFL history, with a little over a baker's dozen being able to accomplish the feat before him, and the veteran is expected to write himself into the record books on Thursday night. Henry will square off against a Miami Dolphins run defense that is near the bottom of the NFL, allowing 5.0 rushing yards per attempt in 2025 (tied for fourth-highest in the league). Miami is also surrendering 145 rushing yards per game this season, and that figure is even higher (153 rushing yards per game) specifically at Hard Rock Stadium. Given that ideal matchup, the oddsmakers believe Henry will cruise to the mile marker. SportsbookDerrick Henry's Week 9 O/U rushing yard propDraftKings Sportsbook90.5 (Over -114, Under -110)FanDuel Sportsbook89.5 (Over -112, Under -112)Caesars Sportsbook89.5 (Over -122, Under -111)Fanatics Sportsbook90.5 (Over -120, Under -110)Like his Ravens as a whole, the 31-year-old has endured an up-and-down campaign in 2025, but has started to heat up in recent weeks. Since Week 6, Henry has averaged 96.5 rushing yards per game. WeekHenry's per-game rushing yard averageWeek 1169.0Week 2-537.0Week 6-896.5Just as important as him gashing opponents on the ground, he has not fumbled the football over this stretch either, and is riding a four-game fumble-less streak into Thursday night. Henry had fumbled the football three times (two lost) over the first three games of the regular season, but has been clean since. \n        \n            \n                Ravens vs. Dolphins prediction: Lamar Jackson returns to lineup as Baltimore battles Miami on 'TNF'\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNot only is this an opportunity for Henry to etch himself further into NFL history, but, with Lamar Jackson back in the fold after missing time due to a hamstring injury, it's an opportunity for the 2-5 Ravens to begin turning the corner and save their season. Derrick Henry's Hall of Fame résumé grows\nWhen it comes to Henry, it's a matter of when, not if, the legendary running back will one day find himself in Canton, Ohio, enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. For instance, 14 of his 16 other players already in the 12,000-yard rushing club are Hall of Famers. The lone backs who aren't in Canton that have exceeded this total are Frank Gore and Adrian Peterson. Gore, the NFL's third-leading rusher all-time, is on the ballot for the first time in 2026 and is a near lock to get in. As for Peterson, he isn't eligible until 2027, but the league's fifth-leading rusher all-time is another no-doubter to be enshrined. With that in mind, this milestone alone warrants Henry for consideration, and, in my estimation, on the first ballot. Henry has been the most physically dominant running back of his era. The former Heisman Trophy winner out of Alabama was the focal point of the Tennessee Titans offense throughout his tenure, and was virtually impossible to slow down. He helped Tennessee to two division titles and four playoff appearances, one of which included a run to the AFC Championship. That year, Henry rushed for 446 yards over three playoff games (148.7 yards per game average). More recently, Henry has been a force within Baltimore's backfield, which included a 2024 campaign where he tallied over 2,000 yards from scrimmage for the second time in his career. While we've focused on Henry's rushing yard total, it's his knack for finding the end zone that makes him otherworldly and a Hall of Fame shoo-in. Henry enters Week 9 with 112 career rushing touchdowns, which already places him fifth all-time in NFL history. He's just eight rushing scores away from knotting himself with Peterson (120) for fourth all-time, and 11 away from Marcus Allen (123) for third. \nPlayerAll-time rushing touchdowns1. Emmitt Smith1642. LaDainian Tomlinson1453. Marcus Allen1234. Adrian Peterson1205. Derrick Henry 112So, when it's all said and done, Henry will find himself inside the top-five call-time in career rushing touchdowns and possibly knocking on the door of the top-10 all-time in career rushing yards. If that's not a first-ballot Hall of Fame running back, I don't know what is. You might as well start crafting the bust now. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a busy offseason on the MLB managerial carousel. At least nine teams will be changing full-time skippers heading into 2026, and three teams are still looking for managers: the Braves, Padres and Rockies. The Twins and Nationals both hired new managers late in October.The Minnesota Twins have gone back to the well and brought back their old bench coach Derek Shelton to replace Rocco Baldelli. Shelton spent the past six seasons at the helm in Pittsburgh. The Nats, meanwhile, have hired MLB's youngest manager in more than five decades. Blake Butera, 33, will take over in D.C. and become the youngest MLB manager since 1972.The Baltimore Orioles, coming off 75-87 season that saw them finish in the basement of the AL East, have hired Guardians associate manager Craig Albernaz. Brandon Hyde was fired in May and interim manager Tony Mansolino was not handed the full-time reins.The Los Angeles Angels, who let go of both Ron Washington and interim Ray Montgomery, have hired former player Kurt Suzuki as their new skipper. Suzuki spent parts of 16 years in the majors, including his last two with the Angels, and won a World Series ring with the Washington Nationals in 2019.\nThe San Francisco Giants, meanwhile, went out of the box and hired Tennessee coach Tony Vitello to take over for Bob Melvin, who was fired after their season ended. Vitello, who went 341-131 in eight years as head coach at Tennessee, is the first collegiate coach to jump straight to an MLB manager job. He also never played professional baseball.The Texas Rangers became Major League Baseball's first team to complete a managerial change earlier in the month, officially announcing that Skip Schumaker will take over in the dugout. Texas had previously announced a parting of ways with Bruce Bochy, the future Hall of Fame skipper who guided the franchise to its first (and to date only) World Series title in 2023.While there is going to be an unusually large amount of turnover, you shouldn't fret.

    "body": "\n        Ravens running back Derrick Henry surpassed Walter Payton to move into fifth on the NFL's list for all-time rushing touchdowns with two scores in a Week 8 win over the Chicago Bears. Now, Henry and the Ravens will visit the Miami Dolphins for a Thursday Night Football matchup in Week 9 that kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is expected to play after missing last week's game with a hamstring injury, and Baltimore is favored by 7.5 points, while the over/under is 51.5. With Jackson back to hold the defense's attention, Henry is one of our top anytime touchdown scorer picks despite the fact that you'll be paying a premium (-200) in the NFL anytime TD scorer odds. Henry's expected to receive another heavy workload on Thursday, and his over/under for total rushing attempts is 18.5.Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Thursday Night Football in Week 9. With NFL props available for almost every player in Dolphins vs. Ravens at top online sportsbooks, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your Ravens vs. Dolphins NFL picks. New users can take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest BetMGM bonus code, where new users can get up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if their first bet loses:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered Week 9 on a 45-28 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns. Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Dolphins vs. Ravens.Best Week 9 Thursday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Derrick Henry, Ravens (-200)De'Von Achane, Dolphins (-150)DeAndre Hopkins, Ravens (+550)Parlay these picks for +1600 odds with the latest DraftKings promo code and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins and three months free NBA League Pass:Derrick Henry, Ravens (-200, bet365)Despite Lamar Jackson being in and out of the lineup this season, Henry has rushed for six touchdowns over the first seven games of this season. He's sitting on 112 rushing touchdowns in his career, and he's scoring at a clip that brings passing Adrian Peterson (120) and possibly even Marcus Allen (123) into the realm of possibility. The Ravens have the potential to get on a roll with the schedule lightening up and Jackson returning, and Henry figures to be a major focal point of that effort. The model predicts that he scores 0.94 touchdowns on average, while the odds imply a 66.6% chance to score. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.De'Von Achane, Dolphins (-150, FanDuel)We're laying more juice here, but Achane has also proven to be worth paying the premium throughout his NFL career. Despite Miami's general struggles this season, he's scored seven times in eight games, and he's now up to 30 touchdowns in 36 career regular-season outings. His involvement in the Dolphins' passing attack also helps protect him against unfavorable game scripts. The model predicts that he scores 1.04 touchdowns on average despite odds that imply a 40% chance of scoring. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.DeAndre Hopkins, Ravens (+550, DraftKings)Hopkins hasn't been a high-volume target in the Baltimore passing attack, but he has been given high-value opportunities. His lone catch last week against the Bears came on a critical third down to help seal the game in the fourth quarter, and he now has 10 catches for 192 yards and two touchdowns this season despite playing only 28.7% of the offensive snaps. A healthy Jackson should be the rising tide that lifts all boats here, and the model predicts that Hopkins scores 0.26 touchdowns on average, greatly outpacing his implied scoring probability of 15.4%.Want more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Dolphins vs. Ravens.

    "body": "\n        It's not a primetime game, but the contest many will highlight with their Week 9 NFL picks is Chiefs vs. Bills at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday. It's become, arguably, the league's preeminent rivalry, and the latest installment has Kansas City as 1.5-point road favorites, per the Week 9 NFL odds. Meanwhile, other contests to be of high interest with NFL bets involve a pair of West Coast teams flying east in 49ers vs. Giants (+2.5) and Seahawks vs. Commanders (+3) on Monday night.If looking for a divisional rivalry when scanning the latest Week 9 NFL lines, you'll just find one in Lions vs. Vikings. Any rest advantage Minnesota hoped for from playing last Thursday is negated by Detroit coming off a bye, and the Lions are one of the biggest favorites, per the Week 9 NFL spreads, as they're giving 8.5 points. Other large lines include Packers vs. Panthers (+13.5), Chargers vs. Titans (+9.5) and Rams vs. Saints (+14) as rookie Tyler Shough will get his first career start. All of the updated Week 9 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 9 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Much has been made about Denver's defense, which ranks fifth in both scoring and total, but Houston boasts the No. 1 defense in both points allowed and yards allowed. It has a +7 turnover differential over the last four games, while Denver has a negative turnover differential (-1) on the season. The Texans offense is also rounding into form as C.J. Stroud had his first 300-yard passing game in Sunday's win over San Francisco, and he was not sacked for the first time this season.Houston has now covered in three of its last four, while Denver is 0-2 versus the line as a road favorite. The Broncos have some questions with their passing game, as the team ranks in the bottom 10 in completion percentage and yards per attempt, while Bo Nix has often come up short in true road games. Nix is just 2-7 outright over his last nine starts in away stadiums as the model has Houston prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 9 NFL predictions: the Chargers (-9.5, 43.5) cover versus the Titans in nearly 60% of simulations. The firing of Brian Callahan hasn't provided the spark that many Titans fans hoped for as the team's lost its two games since, one by 18 points at home and the other by 24 points on the road. Each of Tennessee's last six losses have come by double-digits, and many of those weren't versus teams that are the caliber of the Chargers. Los Angeles ranks in the top eight of the NFL in yards gained, yards allowed, passing offense and passing defense.Meanwhile, Tennessee is dead last in nearly every offensive category, and no team has allowed more rushing touchdowns on defense. The Titans are a staggering 4-21 against the spread since 2024, which is worst in the NFL and amounts to a 16% cover rate. Cam Ward doesn't have a single game so far in which he has more touchdowns than turnovers, as the Chargers are forecasted for a double-digit victory. The model also says the Over hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 9 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 9 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 9 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        Week 9 of the NFL schedule will give the shrinking number of remaining survivor pool players some solid options. Unless the Cincinnati Bengals were your pick, there wasn't a whole lot of carnage in Week 8 as most favorites pulled through. That included the Philadelphia Eagles with a 38-20 win over the New York Giants and the Indianapolis Colts with a 38-14 throttling of the Tennessee Titans. Four teams will be on their bye in Week 9, including Cleveland, the New York Jets, Philadelphia and Tampa Bay. A popular choice this week is the Rams (5-2), who are taking on Saints (1-7), with New Orleans giving rookie QB Tyler Shough his first career start.The Saints have lost three in a row since their 26-14 win over the New York Giants on Oct. 5. The Rams, meanwhile, have won two in a row, including a 35-7 win over Jacksonville on Oct. 19. Los Angeles enters as a 13.5-point favorite in what is one of the largest Week 9 NFL lines, and one of five NFL spreads of at least seven points. Another is the Los Angeles Chargers as 9.5-point favorites over the Tennessee Titans, who have now lost three straight by double digits.

Although Denver leads the AFC West and is riding a five-game winning streak, the Broncos are just 2-2 on the road this season.There are other reasons to fade Denver as well, however. Houston appears to be turning around their fortunes with three wins in their last four games. Quarterback C.J. Stroud played at a high level in the 26-15 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. In that game, he completed 30 of 39 passes (76.9%) for 318 yards and two touchdowns with one interception.Despite opening as a road favorite, the SportsLine's model projects Houston will win this one, making the Broncos a team to stay far away from in NFL survivor pools this week. See which team to pick instead here. You can also use the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets instantly:How to make Week 9 NFL survivor pool picks Instead, the model is confidently backing a team many have not used in survivor pools to win outright in well over 80% of simulations.

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia 76ers are the feel-good story of the young NBA season. The depression of Joel Embiid's real-time demise and the buyer's remorse on Paul George's contract have been pushed into the shadows as the league's most electric young backcourt has stepped into the spotlight. The Sixers are 4-0. Rookie VJ Edgecombe is a revelation. And, oh my god, has Tyrese Maxey made the proverbial leap. Anybody with an NBA pulse already knew Maxey was awesome, but what he's done to start this season has officially stamped the super next to his star. \nThere is probably no faster player in the league than Maxey, not just in a full-court sense but particularly as a downhill penetrator; this guy goes from logo to rim before you even know it happened. But we have seen speed before. Russell Westbrook. Ja Morant. Derrick Rose. De'Aaron Fox. All human jets. But Maxey is setting himself apart as an elite shooter, too. That's a combination we've rarely seen. If ever. It's like a pitcher with both a 100 mph fastball and a lead-balloon changeup. You defend against one, and the other makes you look foolish. \nThat's what Maxey is doing to people right now. He's making 47% of his 3s, with virtually unlimited range, at high volume (over nine per game), and even crazier he's at 54.5% (12 for 22) on off-the-dribble 3s, all of which means defenders are forced to play way too tightly, and way too far from the basket, to have even a fighting chance of staying in front of him when he hits the turbo button. In other words, because he can do this:You have to come up on him like this:Because he has maybe the filthiest step-back in game:You can't help but bite when he shows it to you:And it's not just off the dribble. There is some real Steph Curry stuff happening off the ball, too. Maxey is flying off of screens, and again, because he's such a lethal shooter, you are forced to chase him over the top of the action. And when you do that, he has a red carpet to run the corner into the paint. This is the difference with some of the speed demons mentioned above. If a prime Westbrook or Morant comes off a screen, you just cut underneath and catch him as he comes out the other side because you're not worried about him settling behind the road block and firing a 3. \nBut with Maxey, you can't do that. The threat of his 3-point shot forces you to honor the high side of every action. And then he back-cuts you:Conventional NBA wisdom says there are certain scorers who are, in essence, indefensible. You can make things difficult on them, but in the end it's usually just a matter of whether they're making or missing their shots that night, because they're going to get what they want. They have too many shots, from too many spots, they can go to. If they don't get you one way, they'll get you another. Maxey is now in this class. If his shot isn't falling, he'll just blow past you. Or vice versa. But when he has both aspects cooking, as he has to start this season, forget about it. You might as well sit back and watch the show like the rest of us.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nA third consecutive AFC North title seemed unattainable for the Baltimore Ravens just a few weeks ago. By the time Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season concludes, the possibility of achieving that goal could be very real.Baltimore won its fifth division title in seven seasons in 2024 but lost five of its first six games this year and were without quarterback Lamar Jackson for several weeks due to a hamstring injury, leaving its chances for another crown in peril. After using their bye in Week 7 to regroup, things began to take a positive turn for the Ravens as they cooled off the red-hot Chicago Bears last Sunday with third-stringer Tyler Huntley under center.Later that evening, the AFC North-leading Pittsburgh Steelers suffered their second straight loss, falling 35-25 to the Green Bay Packers. The Steelers dropped to 4-3 with that setback and now have the unenviable task of trying to solve the 7-1 Indianapolis Colts in Week 9.The Ravens are expected to have Jackson back in the lineup for their Week 9 matchup against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday Night Football. Miami (2-6) is coming off a 34-10 triumph over the Atlanta Falcons but has dug itself a deep hole from which it is unlikely to get out of.\nThe return of two-time NFL MVP Jackson, coupled with the low level of difficulty of Baltimore's remaining schedule have many believing the team once again will finish atop the AFC North. Major sportsbooks all have the 2-5 Ravens as the favorites to capture the crown even before Week 9 begins, with the price down from -120 to -130.SportsLine's Inside the Lines team won't go that far, but it does like Baltimore's prospects much more with a victory on Thursday. The ITL team's projection model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, says the Ravens' chances for the division title will be 11% better with a win than a loss to the Dolphins, who basically have no hope for their first AFC East title since 2008 no matter the outcome.CHANCES OF WINNING AFC NORTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 9 WINWITH WEEK 9 LOSSDIFFERENCEBaltimore Ravens23.5%25.7%14.7%11.0%Pittsburgh Steelers69.0%71.7%56.3%15.4%Cincinnati Bengals6.2%9.0%3.8%5.2%Cleveland Browns1.3%2.2%0.5%1.7%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC EASTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 9 WINWITH WEEK 9 LOSSDIFFERENCEMiami Dolphins0.1%0.1%0.0%0.1%Buffalo Bills61.9%68.9%50.3%18.6%New England Patriots38.0%42.7%26.4%16.3%New York Jets0.0%0.0%0.0%0.0%Beginning with their meeting with Miami on Thursday Night Football, the Ravens have five consecutive games against teams with losing records before their first showdown of the season with the Steelers in Week 14. Two of those five matchups are with their other two division rivals, and victories over Cleveland and Cincinnati - which they also face in Week 15 - would further strengthen their chances of finishing atop the AFC North.Wins obviously also would improve Baltimore's outlook for a playoff berth, much more so than Miami's. According to the model, a triumph over the Dolphins would make the Ravens' postseason chances almost 15% better than a loss would. Much like with the AFC East title, Miami's hopes for a playoff berth are almost non-existent.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 9 WINWITH WEEK 9 LOSSDIFFERENCEBaltimore Ravens26.9%30.5%15.8%14.7%Miami Dolphins0.4%1.0%0.1%0.9%Baltimore has split its four matchups against Miami with Jackson at quarterback, and the four-time Pro Bowler came up with some amazing performances. Jackson threw for over 300 yards in three of those contests and made five touchdown passes in each victory. The loss in which he eclipsed the 300-yard mark, which occurred in 2022, also saw him throw for three TDs and run for 119 yards and a score.Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdown passes for the Dolphins in last week's triumph over Atlanta and had an epic outing in the team's 42-38 victory against Baltimore in 2022. The signal-caller set career highs of 469 passing yards and six TD tosses in that contest, and Miami head coach Mike McDaniel is hoping for an effort close to that on Thursday night. Baltimore is a 7.5-point favorite in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is leaning toward a cover by the Ravens as it projects them to post a 35-26 victory.\n            ",

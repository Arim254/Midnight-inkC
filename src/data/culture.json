    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tDecember 24th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOne can hard­ly con­sid­er the Christ­mas sea­son for long, at least in the Eng­lish-speak­ing world, with­out the work of Charles Dick­ens com­ing to mind. That owes for the most part, of course, to A Christ­mas Car­ol, the novel­la that revived the pub­lic cul­ture of a hol­i­day that had been falling into desue­tude by the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry. What­ev­er its lit­er­ary short­com­ings, the book offers a host of mem­o­rable images, not least culi­nary ones: Mrs. Cratchit’s pud­ding, for instance, which Dick­ens likens to “a speck­led can­non-ball, so hard and firm, blaz­ing in half or half-a-quar­tern of ignit­ed brandy, and bedight with Christ­mas hol­ly stuck into the top.”\n\n\n\t\n\nIn the Tast­ing His­to­ry video at the top of the post, host Max Miller teach­es you how to make just such a hol­i­day pud­ding — and indeed a fig­gy one, a con­fec­tion whose name we all rec­og­nize from no less a stan­dard car­ol than “We Wish You a Mer­ry Christ­mas,” even if we don’t know that pud­ding, in the Vic­to­ri­an sense, refers to a kind of cake.\nThe fig­gy pud­ding Miller makes from an orig­i­nal 1845 recipe looks, and seems to taste, more like an alco­hol-soaked ver­sion of the fruit­cakes many of us still receive come Christ­mas­time. Despite its rep­u­ta­tion for lead­en unde­sir­abil­i­ty, rein­forced by decade after decade of John­ny Car­son gags, the fruit­cake has a rich his­to­ry, which Miller reveals in the video just above, and culi­nary strengths beyond its extreme shelf life.\n\n\n\t\n\nThis playlist of 20 Christ­mas-themed videos offers many more such delights: Turk­ish delight, for instance, as well as Vic­to­ri­an sug­ar plums, medieval gin­ger­bread, and his­tor­i­cal ver­sions of such still-com­mon com­forts and joys as eggnog and pump­kin pie. And if you’ve ever won­dered to what was­sail — as a noun or a verb — actu­al­ly refers, have a look at the video above, in which Miller explains it all while mak­ing a pot of the stuff, which turns out to be a kind of apple­sauce-enriched ale. Was­sail, too, is a favorite Dick­ens ref­er­ence, and not just in A Christ­mas Car­ol. His first nov­el The Pick­wick Papers includes a Christ­mas feast with “a mighty bowl of was­sail, some­thing small­er than an ordi­nary wash-house cop­per, in which the hot apples were hiss­ing and bub­bling with a rich look, and a jol­ly sound, that were per­fect­ly irre­sistible”: the kind of image that, near­ly two cen­turies lat­er, still makes read­ers want to go a‑wassailing.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nEudo­ra Welty’s Hand­writ­ten Eggnog Recipe, and Charles Dick­ens’ Recipe for Hol­i­day Punch\nTry George Orwell’s Recipe for Christ­mas Pud­ding, from His Essay “British Cook­ery” (1945)\nCharles Min­gus’ “Top Secret” Eggnog Recipe Con­tains “Enough Alco­hol to Put Down an Ele­phant”\nHow Eat­ing Ken­tucky Fried Chick­en Became a Christ­mas Tra­di­tion in Japan\nTast­ing His­to­ry: A Hit YouTube Series Shows How to Cook the Foods of Ancient Greece & Rome, Medieval Europe, and Oth­er Places & Peri­ods\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tDecember 25th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nIt will no doubt come as a relief to many read­ers that San­ta Claus appears to have been a Union sup­port­er. We know this because he appears dis­trib­ut­ing gifts to sol­diers from that side of the Mason-Dixon in one of his ear­li­est depic­tions. That illus­tra­tion, “San­ta Claus in Camp” (above), first appeared in the Harper’s Week­ly Christ­mas issue of 1862, when the Amer­i­can Civ­il War was still tear­ing its way through the coun­try. Its artist, a Bavar­i­an immi­grant named Thomas Nast, is now remem­bered for hav­ing first drawn the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty as a don­key and the Repub­li­can Par­ty as an ele­phant, but he also did more than any­one else to cre­ate the image of San­ta Claus rec­og­nized around the world today: more than Nor­man Rock­well, and more, even, than the Coca-Cola Com­pa­ny.\n\nSan­ta Claus is an Angli­ciza­tion of Sin­terk­laas, a Dutch name for Saint Nicholas, who lived and died in what’s now Turkey in the third and fourth cen­turies, and who’s been remem­bered since for his kind­ness to chil­dren. Few of us would rec­og­nize him in his por­trait from 1294 that is includ­ed in the Pub­lic Domain Review’s pic­to­r­i­al his­to­ry of San­ta Claus, but with the pass­ing of the cen­turies, his images became mixed with those of oth­er fly­ing, win­ter-asso­ci­at­ed char­ac­ters from Ger­man­ic and Norse myth. In 1822, Clement Moore per­formed a defin­ing act of rhyming syn­the­sis with his poem “A Vis­it from St. Nicholas” (often called “ ‘Twas the Night Before Christ­mas”): in its vers­es we find the bun­dle of toys, the rosy cheeks, the white beard, the bel­ly shak­ing like a bowl full of jel­ly.\n\nNast clear­ly under­stood not just the appeal of Moore’s descrip­tion, but also the char­ac­ter’s pro­pa­gan­da val­ue. His very first ren­di­tions of San­ta Claus appear in the upper cor­ners of an 1862 Harper’s Week­ly illus­tra­tion of a pray­ing wife and her Yan­kee sol­dier hus­band. Near­ly two decades lat­er, Nast drew the car­toon “Mer­ry Old San­ta Claus” (imme­di­ate­ly above), whose cen­tral fig­ure remains imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able to us today, even as its moti­vat­ing polit­i­cal cause of high­er wages for the mil­i­tary has become obscure. In the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, the icon­ic Father Christ­mas would be enlist­ed again to lend pub­lic sup­port to U.S. efforts in World War I and II, in the very decades when Rock­well was fur­ther refin­ing and cement­ing his image in pop­u­lar cul­ture. The once-unlike­ly result was an Amer­i­can San­ta Claus: “the sym­bol of our empire,” in the words of The New York­er’s Adam Gop­nik, “as much as Apol­lo was of the Hel­lenic one.”\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch San­ta Claus, the Ear­li­est Movie About San­ta in Exis­tence (1898)\nDid San­ta Claus & His Rein­deers Begin with a Mush­room Trip?: Dis­cov­er the Psy­che­del­ic, Shaman­is­tic Side of Christ­mas\nHear “Twas The Night Before Christ­mas” Read by Stephen Fry & John Cleese\nJ.

    "body": "\n            Welcome to the 317th installment of A View From the Easel, a series in which artists reflect on their workspace. This week, artists make work alongside their daughter and draw inspiration from local museums.Want to take part? Check out our submission guidelines and share a bit about your studio with us through this form! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.Daniel McCoy Jr., Española, New MexicoHow long have you been working in this space?Four years.Describe an average day in your studio.I wake around 5:15am. I wake up my family and animals. We leave the house around 7, and I drive 35 miles south up to Santa Fe. I return around 9:15am from dropping my Wife Topaz, who is a teacher, son Levon, and daughter Fia at three separate schools. I begin painting around 10am. Music and coffee play an important role at this time. I work until 2:30pm then repeat the process. We will usually do something for dinner, and then I will work until late into the evening. Especially if there is a time-sensitive project that I am working on.How does the space affect your work?This is a comfortable space connected to my home. The important issue is that there is beautiful scenery outside that allows a connection to nature. Throughout the day, I see the sunrise, sunset, view the mountains, and view the stars. How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?I am near Santa Fe, which has a thriving art scene with many galleries and museums to visit for historic art. I live between the Tewa Pueblos nearby and at times I get to view what my friends are creating. I visit the gallery I am represented by, Hecho a Mano, a few times each month to gather inspiration from the current shows. My wife and I are both involved in education in the arts, so we see the beginnings of artistic growth. Plus, I have the best friends a guy could ever have, and they are all artists.What do you love about your studio?It holds my favorite books, my favorite instruments, and all my ideas. What a fortunate human I am. I am very grateful. What do you wish were different?More space, more machines, and woodworking tools. An outside area for carving. The elevation is pretty high here in the mountains and the summer sun can get pretty hot.What is your favorite local museum?SITE Santa Fe. I have had the opportunity to work with the team on various shows over the years. Very special people to me.What is your favorite art material to work with?Oil-based paints. Particularly One Shot Enamel on large surfaces. Keri Arlotta, Oakwood, OhioHow long have you been working in this space?One year.Describe an average day in your studio.A cozy, creative corner in my house is where I find myself with my easel. If I were to zoom out, you could see my four-year-old's toys surrounding my sacred corner of creativity. Her laughter and music from the bijou television above my fireplace mantle echoes amongst the walls. Beside my studio space is a large grid picture window and beyond the window, large colorful foliage illuminates colors into my zone that are so profound and beautiful. The sounds, the sights, and the peace I find here allow me to open new doors within myself. I stand, rarely sit, as I begin blending colors beside my easel. A fresh canvas awaits me and the tone of my space provides a peace within me that allows me to connect to the depths within myself. How does the space affect your work?My space is full of love and light and when I get to soak into that ambience, I am able to tap into a steady flow of creativity.How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?Oakwood is a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. Within Oakwood, large trees consume the city. It’s easy to get lost in a trail, especially in fall, as the leaves die and the colors of dying leaves captivate us. Just a few minutes down the street I am a member and frequent observer at The Contemporary Dayton. I also enjoy checking out work at The Dayton Art Institute and Rosewood Arts Centre.What do you love about your studio?I love the natural light I’m provided with in my studio. I love that the walls in my space are filled with the trials and errors of my own curiosity. I enjoy that my studio is in the heart of my home, where all the things I love gather. I'm exploring the depths of myself here while I witness my daughter explore depths of her own imagination around me. What do you wish were different?Space. I cannot stress this enough. I have a creative corner, but I often imagine what limitations the size of my studio space provides. If I had more space, maybe I could get my hands on different techniques, textures, etc. Or if I had space for a larger canvas, what could I bring to life there? What is your favorite local museum?Dayton Art Institute.What is your favorite art material to work with?Acrylics on canvas.\n                  \n                      \n                        Community\n                      \n                      \n                        A View From the Easel\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n    \n                Daily Newsletter\n                From Christo's billowing flags to forgotten oral histories, this year reminded me why art matters: it gives voice, refuses erasure, and makes something beautiful from the wreckage.\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Film still of Patty Chang, \"Melons (at a loss)\" (1998), on view in Monstrous Beauty (2025) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (image courtesy the artist)\n    \n        \n            This Christmas, I’m grateful — it’s a sentimental time of year, OK? I’m about to hit my two-year mark as an associate editor here at Hyperallergic, where my bread and butter is New York City: a weekly newsletter (my baby), and exhibition reviews — dispatches from the center of the art world (I may be biased). And it’s certainly been an eventful year, from museum reopenings to blockbuster exhibitions to a brand-new mayor, who brought a groundswell of hope and a bounty of memes. To me, though, it's been a year of deepening my relationship to the city — not getting caught up in that never-ending tide that is New York, but finding the stillness beneath the current.“Anchoring” to me means grounding myself in the true, the felt, the tangible. The art world prizes in-person communion — the irreplaceable experience of seeing a work in person — yet increasingly trades in digital surrogates: press releases, Instagram posts, installation views. Coupled with the rise of AI, we’re in danger of losing touch with what's embodied, what's real. The city’s the exact kind of place that interrupts that — you're scrolling peacefully on your phone on the train platform, for instance, and then someone's elbow is in your ribs. The real — if buried and bygone — New York surfaced more pleasantly for me when I got to work with Lower East Side stalwart Arthur Nersesian, whose book The Fuck-Up (1997), a hilarious jaunt through the degenerate ’90s, was one of my favorites of the year. His review of an oral history of the Pyramid Club, now known as Nightclub 101, is steeped in memory and drawn from a deep wellspring of lived history. Meanwhile, I never thought I'd get my heart broken at The Shed, but the Christo show there undid me for similar reasons — I was suddenly seven years old again, looking upon the billowing neon-orange flags reflected in the snow in Central Park.But as far as deepening my relationship with our community goes, meeting so many of you at our Halloween party at Francis Kite Club — particularly in costume — was a highlight of the year. So was our coverage of MFA thesis shows — which most art publications completely ignore, even though students are integral to our community, and its future. But just as important as looking forward is remembering: It is my deepest honor to write the weekly In Memoriam column, in which we memorialize those we lost. Working with our writers is by far the best part of a great gig. I look forward to corresponding with Taliesin Thomas for the Upstate guide every month — both her presence and her emails are just as ebullient as her writing, and it’s infectious enough to melt even my cynical heart. Working with the colossus that is John Yau has sharpened the way that I look at painting and abstraction, and editing the brilliant, broad-minded, and astonishingly erudite Ed Simon on the radical egalitarianism of nativity scenes, the visual history of No Kings, the tackiness and historical backing of Trump’s aesthetic, and so much else has informed my own writing. Our writers enrich my understanding of the world even from afar: Claudia Ross on the way history reverberates surprisingly, painfully, and generatively into the present in her review of the Monuments exhibition in Los Angeles. Noah Angell on the artist who’s been giving voice to the musical instruments languishing in museum storage, dying to be heard. Cristiana Grigore’s deeply personal and moving piece on the Roma artists all of us should know. Anne Anlin Cheng on a show spanning half a millennium of chinoiserie that transforms objectification into something stranger, more insurgent, almost human. And Jad Salfiti on the little Berlin institute that dares to speak up in a country where Palestinian solidarity is nearly verboten. This is what art can do: give voice, refuse erasure, make something beautiful from the wreckage. That’s our work here, too. Thank you for reading, for subscribing, for being part of our community. If you’re not already, please consider supporting our work as a paying Hyperallergic Member — it’d make a great very-last-minute gift, if you’re a procrastinator like me. Happy holidays — and here’s to another year! —Lisa Yin Zhang, associate editorThe options are endless.

(all screenshots Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic via r/WhatIsMyCookieCutter)\n    \n        \n            'Tis the season of over-the-top cookie decorating, and while shaped cookie cutters are normally sold in themed sets, many of them go astray and lose their context entirely. In a Reddit community devoted to figuring out what those unidentified cookie cutters might depict, many of its members are finding that the obscure outlines are the perfect tool to spark their imagination. The subreddit, r/WhatIsMyCookieCutter, carved out its own community during the holiday season in 2022 after years of Reddit users flocking the r/baking forum to get help in figuring out what their rogue cookie cutters are supposed to be. The space started out as a fun guessing game to help solve years-long household mysteries born of many a Christmas past, but it turns out it's much more fun for people to propose the most absurd, niche, and outlandish possibilities, complete with accompanying digital drawings that fit those odd shapes. Alligator flying out of an ice hole? Your guess is as good as mine ...A shape as innocuous as the one pictured above yields myriad interpretations — a testament to the diversity of the human experience. Actually, these guesses are all better than mine. As it turns out, the cookie cutter was identified as the shape of Finland, but never let reality get in the way of your imagination.The community has exploded over the last three years, with over 350,000 weekly visitors. It's also one of the more wholesome spaces on the website. We're all thinking it ... This one was never solved, but the user insisted on no NSFW ideas, so feast thine eyes on this array of family-friendly interpretations.If you give a Redditor a cookie cutter ... Voila!Some of the cookie cutter shapes become blindingly obvious once they're correctly identified, but one must ask why they exist in the first place. For example, this one illustrating a KitchenAid standing mixer: I never would have guessed it, but now I can't unsee it. But those ones only serve to fan the flames of web-based creativity ...All worthy contenders!Many tropes have come about in the community — cats in bizarre poses, weed paraphernalia, Halloween ghosts, the Saddam Hussein hiding place meme, and there's even one user who has become a meme in the subreddit because he interprets every shape as a rose. He's since been dubbed “rose guy,” and many users pay homage to him through their own posts. A top post from the 2025 holiday seasonChoose your fighter, cartoon mammal edition. Sometimes, however, the cookie cutter shape is exactly what it is, and nothing else.There really is something for everyone out there. What are the odds? All of that is to say that the r/WhatIsMyCookieCutter community serves to remind us that there are cathedrals everywhere for those with eyes to see. It's a place to come together, have a laugh, and, for many who may not be art-aligned, a space to exercise the brain's creative side once again. Some users have said that this subreddit has been more helpful for inspiring daily drawing than other communities specifically for art.Or perhaps, the whole endeavor shows us that maybe we shouldn't have done away with the Rorschach test after all. Happy holidays everyone, and may your iced cookies be as unique and creative as each of us. \n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

I love kids.Sandy Ernest Allen confronts their Harry Potter fandom as a trans person for Literary Hub (spoiler — it involves a bonfire):In reality, the number one lesson of the Harry Potter series was, ironically: We’re all humans deserving of equal rights, even the “weirdest” amongst us, even those most discarded by our families and/or by society, even those who’ve been caught up in histories we ourselves don’t yet understand. We’re all people deserving of love and respect and dignity. [...]What to do about this situation, I myself had not been sure. I was an adult and not especially “into” the series (as some adults are). I’d still comfort-binge the movies if they were marathoning on a hotel TV perhaps and I felt the right sort of depressed. But now I’d walk into my office and see her books there on my shelf—and feel sick about the whole situation.There will soon be an artist living in New York City's Gracie Mansion — Rama Duwaji, wife of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, sat for a profile and photoshoot with The Cut, and the internet is atwitter:\n\nThe best latte art in all of antiquity:\ni bet she was the best barista at the carthaginian coffee shop pic.twitter.com/ptW6bu0ll8— romanistani state-affiliated media (@djangofetts) December 17, 2025 \nIf you've been in the art world for any length of time, you know about the near-cultish obsession with Julia Cameron's 1992 self-help book The Artist's Way:\n\nThe plot twist I've been waiting for in every Hallmark Christmas movie:\n\nFinding the holiday spirit in the most unexpected of places — that's what it's all about.

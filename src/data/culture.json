    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nOne of my very first acts as a new New York­er many years ago was to make the jour­ney across three bor­oughs to Wood­lawn Ceme­tery in the Bronx. My pur­pose: a pil­grim­age to Her­man Melville’s grave. I came not to wor­ship a hero, exact­ly, but—as Ford­ham Uni­ver­si­ty Eng­lish pro­fes­sor Angela O’Donnell writes—“to see a friend.” Pro­fes­sor O’Donnell goes on: “It might seem pre­sump­tu­ous to regard a cel­e­brat­ed 19th-cen­tu­ry nov­el­ist so famil­iar­ly, but read­ing a great writer across the decades is a means of con­duct­ing con­ver­sa­tion with him and, inevitably, leads to inti­ma­cy.” I ful­ly share the sen­ti­ment.\nI promised Melville I would vis­it reg­u­lar­ly but, alas, the plea­sures and tra­vails of life in the big city kept me away, and I nev­er returned. No such pet­ty dis­trac­tion kept away a friend-across-the-ages of anoth­er 19th-cen­tu­ry Amer­i­can author.\n“For decades,” writes the Bal­ti­more Sun, “Edgar Allan Poe’s birth­day was marked by a mys­te­ri­ous vis­i­tor to his gravesite in Bal­ti­more. Begin­ning in the 1930s, the ‘Poe Toast­er’ placed three ros­es at the grave every Jan. 19 and opened a bot­tle of cognac, only to dis­ap­pear into the night.” The iden­ti­ty of the orig­i­nal “Poe Toast­er”—who may have been suc­ceed­ed by his son—remains a tan­ta­liz­ing mys­tery. As does the mys­tery of how Edgar Allan Poe died.\nMost of you have prob­a­bly heard some ver­sion of the sto­ry. On Octo­ber 3, 1849, a com­pos­i­tor for the Bal­ti­more Sun, Joseph Walk­er, found Poe lying in a gut­ter. The poet had depart­ed Rich­mond, VA on Sep­tem­ber 27, bound for Philadel­phia “where he was to edit a vol­ume of poet­ry for Mrs. St. Leon Loud,” the Poe Muse­um tells us. Instead, he end­ed up in Bal­ti­more, “semi­con­scious and dressed in cheap, ill-fit­ting clothes so unlike Poe’s usu­al mode of dress that many believe that Poe’s own cloth­ing had been stolen.” He nev­er became lucid enough to explain where he had been or what hap­pened to him: “The father of the detec­tive sto­ry has left us with a real-life mys­tery which Poe schol­ars, med­ical pro­fes­sion­als, and oth­ers have been try­ing to solve for over 150 years.”\nMost peo­ple assume that Poe drank him­self to death. The rumor was part­ly spread by Poe’s friend, edi­tor Joseph Snod­grass, whom the poet had asked for in his semi-lucid state. Snod­grass was “a staunch tem­per­ance advo­cate” and had rea­son to recruit the writer posthu­mous­ly into his cam­paign against drink, despite the fact that Poe had been sober for six months pri­or to his death and had refused alco­hol on his deathbed. Poe’s attend­ing physi­cian, John Moran, dis­missed the binge drink­ing the­o­ry, but that did not help clear up the mys­tery. Moran’s “accounts vary so wide­ly,” writes Biography.com, “that they are not gen­er­al­ly con­sid­ered reli­able.”\nSo what hap­pened? Doc­tors at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Mary­land Med­ical Cen­ter the­o­rize that Poe may have con­tract­ed rabies from one of his own pets—likely a cat. This diag­no­sis accounts for the delir­i­um and oth­er report­ed symp­toms, though “no one can say con­clu­sive­ly,” admits the Center’s Dr. Michael Ben­itez, “since there was no autop­sy after his death.” As with any mys­tery, the frus­trat­ing lack of evi­dence has sparked end­less spec­u­la­tion. The Poe Muse­um offers the fol­low­ing list of pos­si­ble cause of death, with dates and sources, includ­ing the rabies and alco­hol (both over­im­bib­ing and with­draw­al) the­o­ries:\n\n Beat­ing (1857) The Unit­ed States Mag­a­zine Vol.II (1857): 268.\n Epilep­sy (1875) Scrib­n­er’s Month­ly Vo1. 10 (1875): 691.\n Dip­so­ma­nia (1921) Robert­son, John W. Edgar A. Poe A Study. Brough, 1921: 134, 379.\n Heart (1926) Allan, Her­vey. Israfel. Dou­ble­day, 1926: Chapt. XXVII, 670.\n Tox­ic Dis­or­der (1970) Stu­dia Philo1ogica Vol. 16 (1970): 41–42.\n Hypo­glycemia (1979) Artes Lit­er­a­tus (1979) Vol. 5: 7–19.\n Dia­betes (1977) Sin­clair, David. Edgar Allan Poe.

Lit­tle Brown, 1984: 92.\n Por­phryia (1989) JAMA Feb. 10, 1989: 863–864.\n Deleri­um Tremens (1992) Mey­ers, Jef­frey. Edgar A1lan Poe. Charles Scrib­n­er, 1992: 255.\n Rabies (1996) Mary­land Med­ical Jour­nal Sept. 1996: 765–769.\n Heart (1997) Sci­en­tif­ic Sleuthing Review Sum­mer 1997: 1–4.\n Mur­der (1998) Walsh, John E., Mid­night Drea­ry. Rut­gers Univ. Press, 1998: 119–120.\n Epilep­sy (1999) Archives of Neu­rol­o­gy June 1999: 646, 740.\n Car­bon Monox­ide Poi­son­ing (1999) Albert Don­nay\n\nThe Smith­son­ian adds to this list the pos­si­ble caus­es of brain tumor, heavy met­al poi­son­ing, and the flu. They also briefly describe the most pop­u­lar the­o­ry: that Poe died as a result of a prac­tice called “coop­ing.”\nA site called The Med­ical Bag expands on the coop­ing the­o­ry, a favorite of “the vast major­i­ty of Poe biogra­phies.” The term refers to “a prac­tice in the Unit­ed States dur­ing the 19th cen­tu­ry by which inno­cent peo­ple were coerced into vot­ing, often sev­er­al times, for a par­tic­u­lar can­di­date in an elec­tion.” Often­times, these peo­ple were snatched unawares off the streets, “kept in a room, called the coop” and “giv­en alco­hol or drugs in order for them to fol­low orders. If they refused to coop­er­ate, they would be beat­en or even killed.” One dark­ly com­ic detail: vic­tims were often forced to change clothes and were even “forced to wear wigs, fake beards, and mus­tach­es as dis­guis­es so vot­ing offi­cials at polling sta­tions wouldn’t rec­og­nize them.”\nThis the­o­ry is high­ly plau­si­ble. Poe was, after all, found “on the street on Elec­tion Day,” and “the place where he was found, Ryan’s Fourth Ward Polls, was both a bar and a place for vot­ing.” Add to this the noto­ri­ous­ly vio­lent and cor­rupt nature of Bal­ti­more elec­tions at the time, and you have a sce­nario in which the author may very well have been kid­napped, drugged, and beat­en to death in a vot­er fraud scheme. Ulti­mate­ly, how­ev­er, we will like­ly nev­er know for cer­tain what killed Edgar Allan Poe. Per­haps the “Poe Toast­er” was attempt­ing all those years to get the sto­ry from the source as he com­muned with his dead 19th cen­tu­ry friend year after year. But if that mys­te­ri­ous stranger knows the truth, he ain’t talk­ing either.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHear Edgar Allan Poe Sto­ries Read by Iggy Pop, Jeff Buck­ley, Christo­pher Walken, Mar­i­anne Faith­ful & More\n7 Tips from Edgar Allan Poe on How to Write Vivid Sto­ries and Poems\nEdgar Allan Poe’s the Raven: Watch an Award-Win­ning Short Film That Mod­ern­izes Poe’s Clas­sic Tale\nClas­sic Illus­tra­tions of Edgar Allan Poe’s Sto­ries by Gus­tave Doré, Édouard Manet, Har­ry Clarke, Aubrey Beard­s­ley & Arthur Rack­ham\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tOctober 24th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you’ve made the jour­ney to Athens, you prob­a­bly took the time to vis­it its most pop­u­lar tourist attrac­tion, the Acrop­o­lis. On that mon­u­ment-rich hill, you more than like­ly paid spe­cial atten­tion to the Parthenon, the ancient tem­ple ded­i­cat­ed to the city’s name­sake, the god­dess Athena Parthenos. But no mat­ter how much time you spent amid the ruins of the Parthenon, if that vis­it hap­pens to have tak­en place in the past 200 years, you may now ques­tion whether you’ve tru­ly seen it at all. That’s because only recent­ly has scaf­fold­ing been removed that has par­tial­ly obscured its west­ern façade for the past two decades, result­ing in the pur­er visu­al state seen in the clips col­lect­ed above.\nThe press atten­tion drawn by this event prompt­ed Greece’s Min­is­ter of Cul­ture Lin­da Men­doni to declare this the first time the Parthenon’s exte­ri­or has been com­plete­ly free of scaf­fold­ing in about two cen­turies. Hav­ing been orig­i­nal­ly built in the fifth cen­tu­ry BC, and come through most of that span much the worse for wear, it requires inten­sive and near-con­stant main­te­nance.\nIts inun­da­tion by vis­i­tors sure­ly does­n’t help: an esti­mat­ed 4.5 mil­lion peo­ple went to the Acrop­o­lis in 2024, the kind of fig­ure that makes you believe in the diag­noses of glob­al “over­tourism” thrown around these days. The Greek gov­ern­men­t’s coun­ter­mea­sures include a dai­ly vis­i­tor cap of 20,000, imple­ment­ed in 2023, and a require­ment to reserve a timed entry slot.\nIf you’d like to see the whol­ly un-scaf­fold­ed Parthenon in per­son, you’d best reserve your own slot as soon as pos­si­ble: more con­ser­va­tion work is sched­uled to begin in Novem­ber, albeit with tem­po­rary infra­struc­ture designed to be “lighter and aes­thet­i­cal­ly much clos­er to the log­ic of the mon­u­ment,” as Men­doni has explained. But if you miss that win­dow, don’t wor­ry, since that oper­a­tion should only last until ear­ly next sum­mer, and upon its com­ple­tion, “the Parthenon will be com­plete­ly freed of this scaf­fold­ing too, and peo­ple will be able to see it tru­ly free.” Not that they’ll be able to see it for free: even now, a gen­er­al-admis­sion Acrop­o­lis reser­va­tion costs €30 (about $35 USD) dur­ing the sum­mer­time peak sea­son. Athena was the god­dess of wis­dom, war­fare, and hand­i­craft, not wealth, but it clear­ly lies with­in her pow­ers to com­mand a decent price.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Greeks Built Their Mag­nif­i­cent Tem­ples: The Art of Ancient Engi­neer­ing\nA 3D Mod­el Reveals What the Parthenon and Its Inte­ri­or Looked Like 2,500 Years Ago\nHow the Parthenon Mar­bles End­ed Up In The British Muse­um\nThe City of Nashville Built a Full-Scale Repli­ca of the Parthenon in 1897, and It’s Still Stand­ing Today\nArtist is Cre­at­ing a Parthenon Made of 100,000 Banned Books: A Mon­u­ment to Democ­ra­cy & Intel­lec­tu­al Free­dom\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom record-breaking droughts and catastrophic flash floods to contaminated pipelines and increasingly thirsty AI farms, water is at the nexus of the climate crisis. The life-giving liquid is both scarce and too abundant, causing half the global population to lack sustained access to fresh drinking water, while much of the world is subject to hotter, wetter weather that subsumes communities with extreme conditions.\nFor designer, author, and activist Julia Watson, pinpointing myriad approaches to these all-consuming problems is one of the most critical and urgent tasks today. Her new book Lo-TEK Water, published by Taschen, highlights various Indigenous technologies and aquatic systems that could be utilized in adapting to a climate-changed world. \nToby Harriman, Ye-chan Floating Islands of the Intha, Myanmar\nThere are the two-meter-deep canals of Xochimilco, Mexico, which delineate 55,000 square meters of raised fields called chinampas. While built by the Aztecs to clean the water and irrigate crops, this system actually originated with the Nahua people. Similar are the floating islands of Intha Myanmar, which weave together roots, leaves, sediment, and other materials to create hydroponic beds.\nAlthough Watson is keen to draw on ancient practices that could be more widely utilized today, she also highlights more modern approaches, like Pakistan’s Yasmeen Lari, an architect who’s responsible for devising the world’s largest program for creating shelters and cookware that leave no carbon footprint.\nAt 558 pages, Lo—TEK Water positions “water as an intelligent force that can shape resilient cities and landscapes. Aquatic infrastructure is reframed—from extractive and industrial into regenerative and evolving—designed to sustain life for generations,” a statement says.\nWatson is a key voice in the broader Lo—TEK movement, and this new book is a companion to her previous volume focused on sustainable technologies.

(© Marina Abramović; photo by Marco Anelli, courtesy the Marina Abramović Archives and Sean Kelly, New York)\nArt Movements, published every Thursday afternoon, is a roundup of must-know news, appointments, awards, and other happenings in today’s chaotic art world. We read the press releases so you don’t have to.\n\nAwards \n\nArtist Marina Abramović received the 2025 Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture at a ceremony in Tokyo on Tuesday improbably attended by Hilary Clinton. Painter Peter Doig and architect Eduardo Souto de Moura are also among the recipients of this year’s award, presented by the Japan Art Association.\nArtist and educator Rosana Paulino is the recipient of this year’s 2025–2027 Jane Lombard Prize for Art and Social Justice, awarded by the Vera List Center for Art and Politics in New York City. The Afro-Brazilian artist will receive $25,000 in recognition of her 2016 artist book ¿História Natural?, which plumbs the intertwined histories of science and racial violence.\nThe Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture will honor artist Tracey Emin, Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, and the New York art space Socrates Sculpture Park at its 55th annual awards dinner at the Museum of Modern Art next month.\n\n\nTransitions\n\nCanal Projects, an experimental arts nonprofit in Manhattan just four years young, announced this week that it will shutter its physical space and transition into a “granting and funding body.” Read more on Hyperallergic.\nLondon-based painter Gideon Rubin is now represented by Anat Ebgi gallery in New York and Los Angeles.\nAnthony Kiendl will be the next director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, beginning December 1. Kiendl comes from the Vancouver Art Gallery and succeeds Nora Burnett Abrams, who now heads the Institute of Contemporary Art Boston. \nFaena Art, the arts nonprofit arm of the over-the-top Miami Beach and Buenos Aires hotel, has commissioned artist Es Devlin to plunk a 50-foot-wide rotating library filled with 2,500 books on the beach during this year’s Miami Art Week. \n\n\nWildcard\nRefik Anadol’s “Infinity Room” (2015) (© Refik Anadol Studio for Dataland)\n\nRefik Anadol, best known for the strangely meditative, shapeshifting artworks he churns out using artificial intelligence, just announced the opening of “the world’s first Museum of AI Arts” next spring. Appropriately named Dataland — hey, at least they’re not trying to hide anything — the institution will be part of The Grand LA, a Frank Gehry-designed complex in downtown Los Angeles. It’s billed as a space where “human imagination meets machine creativity” and will feature Anadol’s all-encompassing “Infinity Room” (2015) and an immersive space filled with “AI-generated scents.” Cool!!!!

Perhaps most damning was des Cars’s admission that a perimeter video surveillance camera was pointing away from the suspects during the minutes-long robbery. She reportedly also said that she offered to resign from her post, but her request was denied.\nDuring her testimony, des Cars highlighted what she said were her previous attempts to call attention to inadequate and outdated museum security, including a prior testimony before the French Senate in September of 2024 in which she warned of insufficient security infrastructure. De Cars was accompanied by other Louvre leaders, including Deputy General Administrator Francis Steinbock and Security Chief Dominique Buffin, who is the first woman to hold the role and has faced misogynistic backlash online since the heist.\n“I have consistently drawn the attention of our supervisory authorities, the national representation, and the media to the state of disrepair and general obsolescence of the Louvre, its buildings, and its infrastructure,” des Cars testified.\nDes Cars’s appearance before the committee coincided with the Louvre’s post-heist reopening. A spokesperson for the museum told Hyperallergic that timed-entry tickets were completely booked through the week, as they had been before the high-profile crime. Macron reportedly ordered the “speeding up” of security measures at the museum on Wednesday. The Louvre spokesperson declined to answer Hyperallergic‘s question about whether extra security measures had been implemented before the museum reopened.\nAccording to des Cars’s testimony, the museum was undergoing gradual security improvements. The upgrades took place in phases for various reasons, de Cars said, including the large size of the Louvre campus and public interest in keeping the museum open. Some of the renewal projects were expected to begin in early 2026.\n“It would be inconceivable to close the Louvre to the public,” de Cars said. “They necessarily take place over several years.”\nDe Cars said that the museum began installing new perimeter fences in 2022 and has expanded the security staff by 5.5% since she assumed her post in 2021. Still, staff morale appeared to be at a concerning low when employees went on strike in June, citing exhaustion and poor working conditions related to mass tourism. The museum closed for the day as a result.\nThe robbers entered the Louvre’s Galerie d’Apollon at 9:30am on Sunday morning, according to des Cars’s testimony, triggering alarms. “Aging” security cameras, including one pointing away from the window entry point, did not capture footage of the suspects breaking into the museum and stealing the 19th-century crown jewels. Five minutes later, a museum operations staff member called the police. De Cars said museum staff chased the suspects, which prevented them from incinerating their vehicle. Four individuals made off with eight crown jewels, including an emerald set containing gems reportedly originating in Colombia and a tiara set with diamonds and pearls likely from the Persian Gulf or Indian Ocean. The estimated value of the stolen items stands at roughly €88 million (~$102 million).\nA video that emerged yesterday shows at least two individuals, one wearing a bright-yellow safety vest resembling those worn by construction workers, rapidly descending the vehicle’s basket-lift contraption.\nDe Cars suggested short- and long-term security measures to be implemented at the Louvre, including the possibility of a police station inside the museum, restrictions on vehicle access near the building, and enhanced intruder detection technology.\nExperts fear that the jewels will be melted down and sold on the black market, making the prospect of a safe return to the museum unlikely. Though French authorities found traces of  DNA on items discarded by the robbers, no suspects have been identified as of publication, and the International Criminal Police Organization has issued a worldwide alert for the artifacts.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrea Gyorody at the Weisman Museum, with work by Elana Mann in background (photo by Ron Hall, courtesy Andrea Gyorody)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe director of an embattled university museum has resigned after artists accused the school administration of censoring an exhibition she curated. Andrea Gyorody stepped down as director of the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University, confirming to Hyperallergic that today would be her last day in the role.\nHer resignation comes three weeks after the university administration decided to alter two works it considered “political” that were on view in the group show Hold My Hand in Yours, curated by Gyorody. The school then shuttered the exhibition six months early after several artists requested that their work be withdrawn from the show in protest.\nMichael Friel, Pepperdine’s senior director of Communications and Public Relations, told Hyperallergic that Gyorody and the school had “mutually agreed” that she would step down. \n“The University thanks Dr. Gyorody for her leadership and contributions during her tenure,” the museum said.\nThe university had turned off Elana Mann’s video “Call to Arms 2015-2025” (2025), which documents 10 years of performances and protests featuring the artist’s arm-shaped megaphones. Administrators also turned over a small embroidered patch reading “Abolish ICE,” part of the large-scale collaborative sculpture “Con Nuestros Manos Construimos Deidades (With Our Hands We Build Deities)” (2023) by the group Art Made Between Opposite Sides (AMBOS).\n“Because Pepperdine’s established practice with the Weisman Museum has been to avoid overtly political content consistent with the University’s nonprofit status, it removed these two pieces from display,” a university spokesperson told Hyperallergic at the time.\nAfter the museum was shuttered, students, faculty, and alumni voiced their outrage. On Friday, October 17, faculty of the Fine Arts Division at Pepperdine’s Seaver College posted a statement affirming their “full and unwavering support for our students and their right to engage in creative inquiry without fear of censorship.”\n“As educators and scholars, we believe that the freedom to explore complex and challenging ideas is central to the mission of a Christian liberal arts education such as Pepperdine University,” the statement continued. “Suppressing artwork because it is perceived as ‘political’ undermines this mission and erodes trust in the academic process.”\n\nThe “Freedom Wall” at Pepperdine University, where community members posted anti-censorship messages (photo by and courtesy Grace Bidewell)\nOn the evening of October 9, about 100 students gathered for an art night, making posters and signs which were then posted to a “Freedom Wall” at the school’s student center. \nThe protest art will be used again next Wednesday, October 29, in a demonstration outside the Elkins auditorium, where faculty will be meeting to discuss recent events at the museum, according to Pepperdine senior Grace Bidewell. Mann said she plans to attend with her horns to amplify the students’ message. \nBidewell, an art and sustainability double major, told Hyperallergic that the alteration of the artwork was at odds with Pepperdine’s Christian mission. \n“It doesn’t align with their beliefs as a school. Christ had the view that all beings were created equal. Having artwork that respects that view shouldn’t be a problem,” Bidwell said.\nBryan C. Keene, a third-generation Pepperdine alum who also taught art history there and had his first art world job as a museum attendant at the Weisman, echoed those sentiments in an open letter to Pepperdine’s president and board on October 12. \n“The recent censorship of artworks at the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art represents a profound betrayal of Pepperdine’s academic mission, its Christian values, and its stated commitment to diversity and global leadership,” Keene wrote. \nHe also rejected the school’s argument that its nonprofit status prohibited the display of artwork with political content. “Displaying an artist’s work does not constitute institutional endorsement; suggesting otherwise reflects a profound misunderstanding of both art and education,” Keene said.\nGyorody became director of the Weisman in 2021, where she organized exhibitions on artists Hildur Ásgeirsdóttir Jónsson, Jeni Spota C., Isabel Yellin, and Karl Haendel. She was previously assistant curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, where she co-curated Afterlives of the Black Atlantic, which received a 2020 Award for Curatorial Excellence from the Association of Art Museum Curators. \n“It’s a huge loss for the Pepperdine community and the larger LA art community. She’s a brilliant curator, art historian, writer, and thinker,” Mann told Hyperallergic. “There’s a sadness amongst students and faculty, but I hope it will spark meaningful change as to who ultimately decides what will go into the museum.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMatt Stromberg is a freelance visual arts writer based in Los Angeles.

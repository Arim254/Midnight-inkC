    "body": "\n\tin Art, Design, History |   \tFebruary 13th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt does­n’t take too long a look at the almost sur­re­al­is­ti­cal­ly clean-lined build­ings of Wal­ter Gropius to get the impres­sion that the man want­ed to ush­er in a new world, espe­cial­ly when you con­sid­er that many of them went up before World War II. Take the Bauhaus Dessau build­ing, which, though com­plet­ed exact­ly a cen­tu­ry ago, looks like a con­crete trans­mis­sion from the future that nev­er arrived, or one that may indeed still be on the way. It once housed the Ger­man art school turned polit­i­cal and cul­tur­al engine he found­ed in 1919, whose prin­ci­ples includ­ed absolute equal­i­ty between male and female par­tic­i­pants — or they did at first, at any rate.\nSoon decid­ing that the new insti­tu­tion would­n’t be tak­en seri­ous­ly with too high a pro­por­tion of women, Gropius lim­it­ed their enroll­ment to one-third of the stu­dent body. That episode, among oth­ers that under­score the ways in which Gropius and the Bauhaus’ osten­si­ble com­mit­ment to the advance­ment of women was­n’t all it could be, fig­ures into Susanne Radel­hof’s doc­u­men­tary The Untold Sto­ry of Bauhaus Women.\nYet what­ev­er the short­com­ings in that depart­ment one might iden­ti­fy from a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry van­tage, the fact remains that the Bauhaus made pos­si­ble — or at least encour­aged — more endur­ing and influ­en­tial work by female artists and design­ers than almost any art school in ear­ly twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry Europe.\nAmong the almost 500 women who stud­ied at the Bauhaus, the film pro­files fig­ures like Alma Busch­er, “who cre­at­ed pro­to­types of avant-garde fur­ni­ture and toys”; “vision­ary met­al­smith and design­er” Mar­i­anne Brandt; Gun­ta Stöl­zl, whose “weav­ing rev­o­lu­tion­ized mod­ern tex­tile design” (weav­ing even­tu­al­ly being the main pro­gram to which women were admit­ted); Friedl Dick­er, a “mul­ti­tal­ent­ed artist” ded­i­cat­ed to the Bauhaus; and Lucia Moholy, whose “excep­tion­al pho­tographs still influ­ence how we view Bauhaus design today.” The school itself may have shut down in 1933, owing to the con­flict between its aes­thet­ic and polit­i­cal ends and those of the ris­ing Nazi Par­ty, but the for­ward-look­ing nature and world­wide cul­tur­al influ­ence of the Bauhaus have ensured that we still feel the influ­ence of its alum­ni, male and female alike.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Female Pio­neers of the Bauhaus Art Move­ment: Dis­cov­er Gertrud Arndt, Mar­i­anne Brandt, Anni Albers & Oth­er For­got­ten Inno­va­tors\nWatch Bauhaus World, a Free Doc­u­men­tary That Cel­e­brates the 100th Anniver­sary of Germany’s Leg­endary Art, Archi­tec­ture & Design School\nThe Pol­i­tics & Phi­los­o­phy of the Bauhaus Design Move­ment: A Short Intro­duc­tion\nThe Women of the Bauhaus: See Hip, Avant-Garde Pho­tographs of Female Stu­dents & Instruc­tors at the Famous Art School\nAn Oral His­to­ry of the Bauhaus: Hear Rare Inter­views (in Eng­lish) with Wal­ter Gropius, Lud­wig Mies van der Rohe & More\nThe Bauhaus Book­shelf: Down­load Orig­i­nal Bauhaus Books, Jour­nals, Man­i­festos & Ads That Still Inspire Design­ers World­wide\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

(all photos by Studio Kukla, courtesy Participant Inc., unless otherwise noted)\n    \n        \n            Upon entering Participant Inc. gallery in Manhattan's Chinatown, a pitch-black embrace invites us find one another in the dark. As our eyesight adjusts, a constellation of works illuminates [minna|منا]of us, a group exhibition open through March 15 featuring queer artists of the Palestinian, Jordanian, Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian diasporas. Wafts of burning incense mingle with the instrumentals of a commissioned sound mix by Palestinian musician Falyakon to direct visitors through the show, which Palestinian-Jordanian-Egyptian artist Ridikkuluz curated as a space for anti-colonial futurism across tradition and geography.“The show is about giving the pen back to the writer, giving the paintbrush back to the artist, during this time of genocide,” Ridikkuluz told Hyperallergic in an interview at the gallery. “And when there's been so much censorship, these are artists that might not have been able to do this anywhere else.”Across from “Triumvirate” (2023) are three photos by Elias Rischmawi and their family members. (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)While [minna|منا]of us centers the narratives of queer artists with roots in the region, Ridikkuluz emphasized that those identity markers are not the exhibition's sole focus. The show comes at a time when the oppression of LGBTQ+ Arabs has been weaponized in support of Israel's genocide in Gaza, but it intentionally avoids dwelling on collective trauma. “Regarding the work that I'm showing, people are always asking me, 'Is your family okay with you being trans?' And I really hate that question in a way,” said Elias Rischmawi, a multimedia artist of Palestinian descent. “I show that I'm so connected with my family through my work. Even if we might be distant, or if we have our differences, I'm still celebrated in my community. And it's like a 'fuck you' to that.”Elias Jesús Rischmawi, “Triumvirate” (2023)In the exhibition, Rischmawi presents five archival and contemporary photographs depicting family members in Florida, Beit Sahour in the Occupied West Bank, and San Fernando in Chile. In one diptych, a black-and-white photo shows Rischmawi laying their head on their mother's knee, mirroring the adjacent print of a now-lost painting of the artist's mother and great-grandmother in a similar pose.Similarly reaching into tradition and lineage, queer identical twins André and Evan Lenox-Samour work collaboratively and meticulously with mother of pearl — a reference to intricate family heirlooms that were safeguarded during the Nakba in Palestine. Their shimmering sculptures pay homage to these precious objects and to the storied mother-of-pearl artisans of the Hazboun family in Bethlehem through motifs like arrows and eight-pointed stars, evoking themes of direction, migration, and placelessness.André and Evan Lenox-Samour, “The Sky's Assault on the Reality of Men” (2026) (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)André and Evan Lenox-Samour, “The Salmon’s Return (Awdat Al-Samak)” (2019–2024)The exhibition also includes a mixed-media installation by trans Palestinian artist Xaytun Ennasr, a stone bust referencing Egyptian funerary sculptures by Alex Khalifa, and a contemplative film, “Congress of Idoling Persons” (2021), by Beirut-born artist Basyma Saad. On the next floor, home to exhibition co-organizer SALMA gallery, hangs Syrian-Canadian artist Anka Kassabji's poised self-portrait. Relaxing in an icy bath, she gazes over her shoulder with authority while her legs, crossed at the ankle, jut out from the water — resembling the neck of a chilled champagne bottle.Anka Kassabji, “Syrienne Delamer” (2026)“I may be not as confident as my paintings are, but I always want to represent extremely fierce feminine energy in my work,” she told Hyperallergic. “The work has this effect of really icy weather that can be uncomfortable, but I'm still very much in control, and I wanted to celebrate what I've achieved throughout those hard times.”Across the gallery hang three vibrant paintings by Palestinian-Jordanian artist Fares Rizk that portray his better-known alter ego: Sultana, New York's first Palestinian drag queen. Blonde and buxom, Sultana day-dreams, eats knafeh, and snaps a selfie before date night with her devoted boyfriend — channeling her vivacity from the stage to the canvas.Fares Rizk (Sultana), “Date Night“ (2018)Rizk, who has lived in New York for 40 years and debuted Sultana in 1996, told Hyperallergic that his mother heavily encouraged his interests in dance, art, and makeup. Though his siblings have been less supportive, Rizk says that nothing can get between Sultana and her place under the spotlight. “When I belly-dance on stage and the people clap and the light is on me, it's healing all the anxiety,” Rizk said.Exhibition view of Xaytoun Ennasr's “I Want the Land, Not the Sky” (2026)Alex Khalifa, “Bust“ (2026)\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Studio Ghibli’s PONYO debuts February 14 at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, which opened in 2021 with a Miyazaki retrospective. This show aims to convey the film’s whimsy and wonder while examining its profound significance through Miyazaki’s drawings and other elements behind its production.“He set out to do a simple film with a simple storyline for young children,” exhibition curator Jessica Niebel told Hyperallergic. “He achieved that, but Ponyo is also very multi-layered and complex.”Art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida are on view in the exhibition.

In keeping with this, the sight lines of much of the exhibition are intentionally lowered, said Shraddha Aryal, executive VP of exhibitions at the Academy Museum. She and her team also designed interactive elements, such as a movable figure of Ponyo running across the waves and a large-scale green bucket based on the one that Sosuke keeps Ponyo in, which smaller visitors can crawl into.There is also an interactive animation table, featuring colorful sea-creature cut-outs designed by Studio Ghibli. Using their phone and an app, guests can rearrange squid, crabs, sharks, and a pufferfish to create their own stop-motion film.The show includes a large-scale green bucket, a reference from the film, which smaller visitors can crawl into.

Use gently warped lines that allow the possibility of magic to exist, liberating us from the curse of perspective drawing. A world where even the horizon swells, dips, and sways,” he intones from a wall panel in the exhibition. Aryal echoed this sentiment in the exhibition design, even fabricating circular frames for the watercolor and pastel art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida.Ponyo is significant in part because it was completely hand-drawn, a return to form after some computer animation was used in previous Ghibli films. The exhibition features over 100 objects donated by Studio Ghibli, including several drawings by Miyazaki, highlighting the analog aspect of the film’s creation. The works are staged around a modest wooden desk used by Ghibli animators.A wooden desk used by Ghibli animators (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)These objects, with their distinctly human traces, will perhaps be even more deeply appreciated by audiences today, amid an onslaught of digitally generated images often indistinguishable from reality. Studio Ghibli’s Ponyo is not an exhaustive cinematic overview of the film, but rather an evocative experience that channels some of its captivating enchantment. “The film has these moments of slowing down, contemplative, mesmerizing moments,” Niebel said, adding that the oversized bucket offers an entry point into this calm, cool world. “Originally, we wanted to make it a little smaller, and then our director Amy Homma asked, ‘What if adults want to crawl in, too?’”Installation view of Studio Ghibli’s PONYO at the Academy Museum (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Los Angeles\n                      \n                      \n                        Studio Ghibli\n                      \n                      \n                        Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

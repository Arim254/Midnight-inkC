    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe Renais­sance did not, strict­ly speak­ing, occur in Chi­na. Yet it seems that the Mid­dle King­dom did have its Renais­sance men, so to speak, and in much ear­li­er times at that. We find one such illus­tri­ous fig­ure in the Han dynasty of the first and sec­ond cen­turies: a states­man named Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), who man­aged to dis­tin­guish him­self across a range of fields from math­e­mat­ics to astron­o­my to phi­los­o­phy to poet­ry. His accom­plish­ments in sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy include invent­ing the first hydraulic armil­lary sphere for observ­ing the heav­ens, improv­ing water clocks with a sec­ondary tank, cal­cu­lat­ing pi fur­ther than it had been in Chi­na to date, and mak­ing dis­cov­er­ies about the nature of the moon. He also, so records show, put togeth­er the first-ever seis­mo­scope, a device for detect­ing earth­quakes.\nA visu­al expla­na­tion of Zhang’s design appears in the Sci­ence­World video above. His seis­mo­scope, its nar­ra­tor says, “was called hòufēng dìdòngyí, which means ‘instru­ment for mea­sur­ing sea­son­al winds and move­ments of the earth,’ ” and it could “deter­mine rough­ly the direc­tion in which an earth­quake occurred.”\nEach of its eight drag­on heads (a com­bi­na­tion of num­ber and crea­ture that, in Chi­na, could hard­ly be more aus­pi­cious) holds a ball; when the ground shook, the drag­on point­ing toward the epi­cen­ter of the quake drops its ball into the mouth of one of the dec­o­ra­tive toads wait­ing below. At one time, as his­to­ry has record­ed, it “detect­ed an earth­quake 650 kilo­me­ters, or 400 miles away, that was­n’t felt at the loca­tion of the seis­mo­scope.”\nNot bad, con­sid­er­ing that nei­ther Zhang nor any­one else had yet heard of tec­ton­ic plates. But as all engi­neers know, prac­ti­cal devices often work just fine even in the absence of com­plete­ly sound the­o­ry. Though no con­tem­po­rary exam­ples of hòufēng dìdòngyí sur­vive from Zhang’s time, “researchers believe that inside the seis­mo­scope were a pen­du­lum, a bronze ball under the pen­du­lum, eight chan­nels, and eight levers that acti­vat­ed the drag­ons’ mouths.” Mov­ing in response to a shock wave, the pen­du­lum would release the ball in the oppo­site direc­tion, which would roll down a chan­nel and release the mouth at the end of it. How­ev­er inno­v­a­tive it was for its time, this scheme could, of course, pro­vide no infor­ma­tion about exact­ly how far away the earth­quake hap­pened, to say noth­ing of pre­dic­tion. For­tu­nate­ly, cen­turies of Renais­sance men still lay ahead to fig­ure all that out.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Greeks Invent­ed the First Com­put­er: An Intro­duc­tion to the Antikythera Mech­a­nism (Cir­ca 87 BC)\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nBehold Col­or Pho­tographs Tak­en Dur­ing the After­math of San Francisco’s Dev­as­tat­ing 1906 Earth­quake\nChina’s 8,000 Ter­ra­cot­ta War­riors: An Ani­mat­ed & Inter­ac­tive Intro­duc­tion to a Great Archae­o­log­i­cal Dis­cov­ery\nWhat Ancient Chi­nese Phi­los­o­phy Can Teach Us About Liv­ing the Good Life Today: Lessons from Harvard’s Pop­u­lar Pro­fes­sor, Michael Puett\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Traveling to the Okinawa prefecture in the hopes of encountering a scarcely documented species of larval goosefish, Kovacs spent nearly two weeks blackwater diving before photographing the rare moment. \n“Unfortunately, this beautiful little fish turned out to be incredibly uncooperative and difficult to photograph,” Kovacs says. “After spending some time with it, I was very fortunate that, for one brief moment, it decided to yawn while facing the camera.” The resulting image is aptly titled “Tired fish.”\nSteven Kovacs, “Tired Fish,” Kumejima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan\nThis past year, the annual contest saw thousands of entries spanning more than 90 countries. From silky sharks in Cuba to small pipefish in Indonesia, each photograph highlights unique, fleeting underwater moments that often go unseen.

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“Some people say that my work questions dominant notions of cultural identity, and perhaps that’s true,” says Bolivian photographer River Claure. “But I’m drawn to many things, such as thinking about landscapes, or the way clouds appear in a bright blue sky in some of my photographs.”\nClaure’s atmospheric photos capture daily life and dream-like scenes in Bolivia, infused with magical realism, that prompt our curiosity about community, narrative, and the land. He’s based in a valley called Cochabamba, where his grandparents immigrated in the 1970s to escape political conflicts in their former home, an Indigenous Andean community called Calacota.\n“Palliri”\nGrowing up, “I was not very conscious—nor did I value my Indigenous roots at all; in fact, it is something I specifically denied,” Claure says in an interview with koozArch. “I remember episodes in my teens where I didn’t want my friends in high school to know that my grandmother was Chola. It was something of which I was ashamed, although of course now, I find that ridiculous.”\nWhen Claure began committing himself seriously to making art, he was awakened to his ancestry and local community in a new way, realizing that what he had tried to suppress in his youth was actually exactly what he most needed to explore. His work is often informed by Christian symbolism, such as in the Virgin Cerro works, in which a figure sits within a mound of sand and assumes the form of a religious icon.\nPlay is another feature of his practice, not just in the tableaux he captures—such as soccer players and expressive local children—but also in his approach. “I would say I play a lot: I play professionally,” Claure says in a statement. “I play in a kind of grand contemporary theater, blending everything: my family’s history, my Indigenous roots, my post-internet contradictions, fashion, literature, the Latin American colonial archive, foundational myths, and much more.”\nHis work is imbued with a sense of nostalgia—a longing for connections to “the mystical, the epic, and the sacred, in order to create rituals of my own invention,” he says. In scenes that volley between happenstance and choreography, he explores time, community, and relationships between reality and fantasy.\n“Villa Adela”\nClaure’s images emphasize individuals, Indigenous customs, the earth, and belief systems as a way of resisting capitalistic influences. And through compositions that feel dreamy and mysterious—even timeless—he generates his own myths as a way to question values and the forces of transition.\nAs part of the 2026 Vital Impacts awards, which support photographers who illuminate environmental challenges within their communities, Claure is the recipient of the E.O. Wilson Fellowship. The fellowship supports his project titled A Boat for the Future of the Mountains, which he describes as “a time capsule project” focused on communities in the Bolivian Andes where lakes and rivers are disappearing.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nJoy Machine is thrilled to present World in My Eyes, a duo exhibition of Chicago artists Kayla Mahaffey and Joseph Perez, a.k.a. Sentrock.\nWorld in My Eyes is, first and foremost, rooted in the lives of everyday people. Both Sentrock and Mahaffey have long depicted friends and neighbors in their own Chicago neighborhoods, exploring how our city shapes its youngest residents. How are children cared for? How are their imaginations and dreams nurtured? These questions recur throughout both artists’ practices and always hinge on another: how do children thrive amid turmoil, whether political, cultural, or personal?\nSentrock, “Better days ahead” (2026), spray paint and latex paint on canvas, 36 x 48 inches\nIn World in My Eyes, Sentrock’s signature bird character meets Mahaffey’s energetic cast. Each artist confronts an underlying struggle—whether an unrealized dream or a physical need—not through an unrealistic swaddle of optimism but rather through the often-repeated idea that hope is a practice. For children, and for all of us seeking a better tomorrow, hope starts with courage.\nAn opening reception will be held from 6 to 9 p.m. on January 30. RSVP.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn his forthcoming solo exhibition, Building Identities Through Style, Glenn Hardy Jr. excavates the strata of fashion, especially how identities are shaped and perceived through appearance. \nBased in Washington, D.C., Hardy is a self-taught painter whose bold portraits emphasize Black life “liberated from the burdens of racial stereotypes and conflict,” says Charlie James Gallery, which is currently presenting the show. The figures in Hardy’s compositions often engage in everyday leisure activities or settle into places of refuge and camaraderie, like studios, athletic courts, and domestic spaces.\n“Mannequin | Cherry Blossoms” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 40 x 30 inches\nBuilding Identities Through Style emphasizes fashion as more than simply personal expression or “self-celebration,” as described in a statement. Hardy examines the complexities of garments, trends, and luxury through the lens of desire and access, juxtaposing elements of reality and fantasy—especially in a series of paintings of mannequins topped with realistic visages, like individual characters being pieced together as their tailored apparel takes shape.\nThe artist is interested in how sartorial choices nod to complex systems of negotiation and judgment that inform our understanding of conformity, difference, and a sense of belonging. “Hardy not only interrogates the manner in which Black bodies are seen and assessed, but also the ways in which stylistic excellence has become both reputational armor and a source of joy, experimentation, and play,” the gallery says.\n“Soar Thumb,” for example, portrays a group of men in an elevator, all but one of whom are dressed in nearly identical suits and sport short haircuts. The outlier is a tall individual with bold dreadlocks and a white tank top, standing confidently with his arms crossed and gazing directly at the viewer. \n“Soar Thumb” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 36 x 36 inches\nHardy frames the contrast not as an act of rebellion but as a means of parsing how, within a shared space, some find conformity to bring a sense of safety or comfort, while others view individual expression to be—in addition to its liberating nature—a kind of buffer or armor.\n“The suited figures are not antagonists but participants in the same system of social evaluation, using uniformity as protection,” says a statement. “The outlier is neither hero nor foil; he is exposed. The work asks not which presentation is more authentic, but what each form of visibility costs.”\nBuilding Identities Through Style continues through February 7 in Los Angeles.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 1835, a tortoiseshell cat measuring more than three feet long was enough to warrant a small advertisement in a British newspaper that as “the greatest curiosity ever shown to the public,” it could be viewed at the Ship Tavern in London. Surely a pint of ale was the informal fee to view this extraordinary animal.\nIt was during the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe that cats became increasingly recognized as worthy pets, beyond their role as mousers. Breweries and distilleries often still “employ” a cat or two to keep the rodents out of the grain. From supernatural kaibyō in Japanese folklore to felines’ divine status in ancient Egypt, the animals have had an indelible influence on mythology, history, and our daily lives for a very long time.\nXuan Loc Xuan, “Nasturtium Cat” (2023), digital painting, 9 7/8 × 11 3/8 inches. Image courtesy of the artist\nForthcoming from Phaidon, the book Cat celebrates, well, exactly what you’d expect. From contemporary sculpture and illustrations to early photography and internet memes, the volume runs the gamut of feline personalities and depictions in art throughout the millennia. Yet no matter how diverse the portrayals or how long ago they were created, the creatures’ expressiveness—even ridiculousness—is universally relatable.\nCat surveys an immense range of mediums and eras, from medieval illuminated manuscripts to modern street art. Colossal readers may be familiar with artists like Xuan Loc Xuan, Lee Sangsoo, and Utagawa Hiroshige, among many others, whose multimedia explorations of feline nature fill the playful tome.\nSlated for release on February 11, Cat is available for pre-order in the Colossal Shop.\nBill Traylor, Untitled (Midnight Blue Cat) (c. 1939–42), poster paint on found cardboard, 11 × 8 inches.

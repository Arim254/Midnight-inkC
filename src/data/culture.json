The sto­ry of the <em>Doc­tor Who</em> theme’s cre­ation is almost as inter­est­ing as the tune itself, with its “swoop­ing, hiss­ing and puls­ing” that “man­ages to be at once haunt­ing, goofy and ethe­re­al.” Just above, you can see Der­byshire and her assis­tant Dick Mills tell it in brief.</p>\n<p>What we learn from them is fas­ci­nat­ing, con­sid­er­ing that com­po­si­tions like this are now cre­at­ed in pow­er­ful com­put­er sys­tems with dozens of sep­a­rate tracks and dig­i­tal effects. The <em>Doc­tor Who</em> theme, on the oth­er hand, record­ed in 1963, was made even before basic ana­log syn­the­siz­ers came into use. “There are no musi­cians,” says Mills, “there are no syn­the­siz­ers, and in those days, we didn’t even have a 2‑track or a stereo machine, it was always mono.” (Despite pop­u­lar mis­con­cep­tions, the theme<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thereminworld.com/theremin-faq\"> does not fea­ture a Theremin</a>.) Der­byshire con­firms; each and every part of the song “was con­struct­ed on quar­ter-inch mono tape,” she says, “inch by inch by inch,” using such record­ing tech­niques as “fil­tered white noise” and some­thing called a “wob­bu­la­tor.” How were all of these painstak­ing­ly con­struct­ed indi­vid­ual parts com­bined with­out mul­ti­track tech­nol­o­gy? “We cre­at­ed three sep­a­rate tapes,” Der­byshire explains, “put them onto three machines and stood next to them and said “Ready, steady, go!” and pushed all the ‘start’ but­tons at once. It seemed to work.”</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZzTGT9k4_ow?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>The theme came about when Grain­er received a com­mis­sion from the BBC after his well-received work on oth­er series. He “com­posed the theme on a sin­gle sheet of A4 man­u­script,” writes Mark Ayres in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150206094054/http:/markayres.rwsprojects.co.uk/DWTheme.htm\">exten­sive online his­to­ry</a>, “and sent it over from his home in Por­tu­gal, leav­ing the Work­shop to get on with it.” Aware that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te\">musique con­crète</a> tech­niques Der­byshire and her team used “were very time-con­sum­ing, Grain­er pro­vid­ed a very sim­ple com­po­si­tion, in essence just the famous bass line and a swoop­ing melody,” as well as vague­ly evoca­tive instruc­tions for orches­tra­tion like “wind bub­ble” and “cloud.” Ayres writes, “To an inven­tive radio­phon­ic com­pos­er such as Delia Der­byshire, this was a gift.” Indeed “upon hear­ing it,” <em>The Atlantic</em> notes, “a very impressed Grain­er bare­ly rec­og­nized it as his com­po­si­tion. Due to BBC poli­cies at the time, Grainer—against his objections—is still offi­cial­ly cred­it­ed as the sole writer.” But the cred­it for this futur­is­tic work—which sounds absolute­ly like noth­ing else of the time and “which brought to a wide audi­ence meth­ods once exclu­sive to the high mod­ernism of exper­i­men­tal composition”—should equal­ly go to Der­byshire and her team. You can con­trast that ahead-of-its-time orig­i­nal theme with all of the iter­a­tions to fol­low in the video just above.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qsRuhCflRyg?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2015/06/hear-seven-hours-of-women-making-electronic-music-1938-2014.html\">Hear Sev­en Hours of Women Mak­ing Elec­tron­ic Music (1938- 2014)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2015/07/two-documentaries-introduce-delia-derbyshire-the-pioneer-in-electronic-music.html\">Two Doc­u­men­taries Intro­duce Delia Der­byshire, the Pio­neer in Elec­tron­ic Music</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Meet Four Women Who Pioneered Electronic Music: Daphne Oram, Laurie Spiegel, Éliane Radigue & Pauline Oliveros\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/06/4-women-who-pioneered-electronic-music-daphne-oram-laurie-spiegel-eliane-radigue-pauline-oliveros.html\">Meet Four Women Who Pio­neered Elec­tron­ic Music: Daphne Oram, Lau­rie Spiegel, Éliane Radigue & Pauline Oliv­eros</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>\n        \t</div>",

We use it to express mild sur­prise that one per­son could use both their left and right hemi­spheres equal­ly well. But in Leonardo’s day, peo­ple did not think of them­selves as hav­ing two brains, and the worlds of art and sci­ence were not so far apart as they are now.</p>\n<p>That Leonar­do was able to com­bine fine arts and fine engi­neer­ing may not have been over­ly sur­pris­ing to his con­tem­po­raries, though he was an extra­or­di­nar­i­ly bril­liant exam­ple of the phe­nom­e­non. The more we learn about him, the more we see how close­ly relat­ed the two pur­suits were in his mind.</p>\n<p>He approached every­thing he did as a tech­ni­cian. The uncan­ny effects he achieved in paint­ing were the result, as in so much Renais­sance art, of math­e­mat­i­cal pre­ci­sion, care­ful study, and first­hand obser­va­tion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2.png 765w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-240x182.png 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-360x273.png 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-300x227.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>His artis­tic projects were also exper­i­ments. Some of them failed, as most exper­i­ments do, and some he aban­doned, as he did so many sci­en­tif­ic projects. No mat­ter what, he nev­er under­took any­thing, whether mechan­i­cal, anatom­i­cal, or artis­tic, with­out care­ful plan­ning and design, as his copi­ous note­books tes­ti­fy. As more and more of those note­books have become avail­able online, both Renais­sance schol­ars and laypeo­ple alike have learned con­sid­er­ably more about how Leonardo’s mind worked.</p>\n<p>First, there was the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-codex-arundel-mapping-leonardo-s-working-life-the-british-library/5AUBtgGQK_TgJQ?hl=en\"><em>Codex Arun­del</em></a>. It is, writes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/12/leonardo-da-vinci-notebooks-art\">Jonathan Jones at <em>The Guardian</em></a>, “the liv­ing record of a uni­ver­sal mind”—but also, specif­i­cal­ly, the mind of a “technophile.” Then, the Vic­to­ria and Albert Nation­al Art Library <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html\">announced the dig­i­ti­za­tion of<em> Codex Forster</em></a>, which con­tains some of Leonardo’s ear­li­est note­books. Now The Visu­al Agency has released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">a com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em></a>, a huge col­lec­tion of the artist, engi­neer, and inventor’s fine­ly-illus­trat­ed notes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png 835w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-240x178.png 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-360x268.png 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-768x571.png 768w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-300x223.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“No oth­er col­lec­tion counts more orig­i­nal papers writ­ten by Leonar­do,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">notes Google</a>. The <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> “con­sists of 1119 papers, most of them drawn or writ­ten on both sides.” Its name has “noth­ing to do with the Atlantic Ocean, or with some eso­teric, mys­te­ri­ous con­tent hid­den in its pages.” The 12-vol­ume col­lec­tion acquired its title because the draw­ings and writ­ings were bound with the same size paper that was used for mak­ing atlases. Gath­ered in the 16th cen­tu­ry by sculp­tor Pom­peo Leoni, the papers descend­ed from Leonardo’s close stu­dent Gio­van Francesco Melzi, who was entrust­ed with them after his teacher’s death.</p>\n<p>The his­to­ry of the Codex itself makes for a fas­ci­nat­ing nar­ra­tive, much of which you can learn at Google’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">Ten Key Facts slideshow</a>. The note­books span Leonardo’s career, from 1478, when he was “still work­ing in his native Tus­cany, to 1519, when he died in France.” The col­lec­tion was tak­en from Milan by Napoleon and brought to France, where it remained in the Lou­vre until 1815, when the Con­gress of Vien­na ruled that all art­works stolen by the for­mer Emper­or be returned. (The emis­sary tasked with return­ing the Codex could not deci­pher Leonardo’s mir­ror writ­ing and took it for Chi­nese.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222010/Atlanticus3-e1557900402461.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">The Codex</a> con­tains not only engi­neer­ing dia­grams, anato­my stud­ies, and artis­tic sketch­es, but also fables writ­ten by Leonar­do, inspired by Flo­ren­tine lit­er­a­ture. And it fea­tures <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html\">Leonardo’s famed “CV,</a>” a let­ter he wrote to the Duke of Milan describ­ing in nine points his qual­i­fi­ca­tions for the post of mil­i­tary engi­neer. In point four, he writes, “I still have very con­ve­nient bomb­ing meth­ods that are easy to trans­port; they launch stones and sim­i­lar such in a tem­pest full of smoke to fright­en the ene­my, caus­ing great dam­age and con­fu­sion.”</p>\n<p>As if in illus­tra­tion, else­where in the Codex, the draw­ing above appears, “one of the most cel­e­brat­ed” of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">the col­lec­tion</a>.” It was “shown to trav­el­ing for­eign­ers vis­it­ing the Ambrosiana [the Bib­liote­ca Ambrosiana in Milan, where the Codex resides] since the 18th cen­tu­ry, usu­al­ly arous­ing much amaze­ment.” It is still amaz­ing, espe­cial­ly if we con­sid­er the pos­si­bil­i­ty that its artistry might have been some­thing of a byprod­uct for its cre­ator, whose pri­ma­ry moti­va­tion seems to have been solv­ing tech­ni­cal problems—in the most ele­gant ways imag­in­able.</p>\n<p>See the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> here.</a></p>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html\">Leonar­do da Vinci’s Ear­li­est Note­books Now Dig­i­tized and Made Free Online: Explore His Inge­nious Draw­ings, Dia­grams, Mir­ror Writ­ing & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/04/how-leonardo-da-vinci-drew-an-accurate-satellite-map-of-an-italian-city-1502.html\">How Leonar­do da Vin­ci Drew an Accu­rate Satel­lite Map of an Ital­ian City (1502)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Leonardo da Vinci’s Handwritten Resume (Circa 1482)\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html\">Leonar­do da Vinci’s Hand­writ­ten Resume (Cir­ca 1482)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Leonardo Da Vinci’s To-Do List from 1490: The Plan of a Renaissance Man\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/09/leonardo-da-vincis-to-do-list-from-1490.html\">Leonar­do Da Vinci’s To-Do List from 1490: The Plan of a Renais­sance Man</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>",

There would be plen­ty of oth­er women, but none who played quite the same role in his life as Mar­ić, not only the moth­er of his chil­dren, but also — accord­ing to some his­to­ri­ans — a col­lab­o­ra­tor on some of his accom­plish­ments in physics. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lostwomenofscience.org/post/does-mileva-einstein-maric-deserve-credit-for-albert-einsteins-discoveries\">Accord­ing to Lost Women of Sci­ence</a>, “there is lit­tle tan­gi­ble evi­dence to sup­port the claims that Mar­ić was a co-author of Einstein’s first major work. That said, there are plen­ty of per­son­al tes­ti­monies from those who knew Mar­ić and Ein­stein that her involve­ment was like­ly.” One con­di­tion of their divorce set­tle­ment, at any rate, held that Mar­ić receive his Nobel Prize mon­ey, were he to win it, which he went on to do a cou­ple of years lat­er.

Antho­ny Burgess’ har­row­ing, lin­guis­ti­cal­ly inven­tive nov­el of a grim near future has come out on top in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pen.org/banned-books-list-2025/\">PEN Amer­i­ca’s lat­est rank­ing of banned books</a>: that is, books removed or pre­vent­ed even from enter­ing pub­lic school libraries, most com­mon­ly in the state of Flori­da, with Texas and Ten­nessee as run­ners-up. Fur­ther down the list appears anoth­er wide­ly known dystopi­an saga, Mar­garet Atwood’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4oc8i6x\"><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></a>; Toni Mor­rison’s tale of Depres­sion-era race rela­tions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nBZyGG\"><em>The Bluest Eye</em></a>; and even such long-pop­u­lar “young adult” stan­dards as Judy Blume’s <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/42uR1wW\">For­ev­er</a>…</em> and Stephen Chbosky’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/42w4NPP\"><em>The Perks of Being a Wall­flower</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Since its pub­li­ca­tion in 1962, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3IJzMRV\"><em>A Clock­work</em> <em>Orange</em></a> has faced mul­ti­ple book ban­ning attempts due to the sex­u­al vio­lence it depicts,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bannedbooks.library.cmu.edu/a-clockwork-orange/\">says Carnegie Mel­lon Uni­ver­si­ty’s Banned Books Project</a>. “In 1973, a book­seller in Orem, Utah, was arrest­ed for sell­ing the nov­el along with two oth­er ‘obscene’ books.”</p>\n<p>Bans fol­lowed “in 1976 in Auro­ra, Col­orado, in 1977 in West­port, Con­necti­cut, and in 1982 in Annis­ton, Alaba­ma. As recent­ly as 2019, mem­bers of the Flori­da Cit­i­zens Alliance” — in yet anoth­er exam­ple of the sur­pris­ing ten­den­cy toward cul­tur­al author­i­tar­i­an­ism in the Sun­shine State — “have lob­bied to ban the book along with almost one hun­dred oth­er ‘porno­graph­ic’ nov­els.”</p>\n<p>The noto­ri­ety of <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3IJzMRV\">A Clock­work Orange</a> </em>in this regard prob­a­bly owes some­thing to the steely lurid­ness of Stan­ley Kubrick­’s film adap­ta­tion, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/when-stanley-kubrick-banned-a-clockwork-orange.html\">which was banned in Eng­land by Kubrick him­self</a>. It makes, in any case, for an iron­ic object of a book ban, giv­en its themes. Burgess was inspired to write this nov­el of juve­nile ultra-delin­quen­cy, as he explains in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jYOqu4b9BY\">the inter­view clip above</a>, by “talk in the nine­teen-six­ties of the pos­si­bil­i­ty of get­ting these young thugs and not putting them in jail, because jail is need­ed for pro­fes­sion­al crim­i­nals, but rather putting them through a course of con­di­tion­ing” to make them behave less like organ­isms than machines: the “clock­work oranges” of the title. The state, it seemed, “was all too ready to take over our brains and turn us into good lit­tle cit­i­zens with­out the pow­er of choice” — a process that plau­si­bly begins by restrict­ing the choice of read­ing mate­r­i­al.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/03/anthony-burgess-lists-his-five-favorite-dystopian-novels.html\"><em>A Clock­work Orange</em> Author Antho­ny Burgess Lists His Five Favorite Dystopi­an Nov­els: Orwell’s 1984, Huxley’s Island & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/10/anthony-burgess-names-the-99-best-novels-in-english.html\">Antho­ny Burgess Names the 99 Best Nov­els in Eng­lish Between 1939 & 1983: Orwell, Nabokov, Hux­ley & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/02/why-maya-angelous-memoir-i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-became-one-of-the-most-banned-books-of-all-time.html\">Why Maya Angelou’s Mem­oir <em>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</em> Became One of the Most Banned Books of All Time</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/01/the-brooklyn-public-library-gives-every-teenager-in-the-u-s-free-access-to-censored-books.html\">The Brook­lyn Pub­lic Library Gives Every Teenag­er in the U.S. Free Access to Cen­sored Books</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/09/americas-first-banned-book-discover-the-1637-book-that-mocked-the-puritans.html\">America’s First Banned Book: Dis­cov­er the 1637 Book That Mocked the Puri­tans</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/04/the-new-york-public-library-provides-free-online-access-to-four-banned-books-catcher-in-the-rye-stamped-more.html\">The New York Pub­lic Library Pro­vides Free Online Access to Banned Books: <em>Catch­er in the Rye</em>, <em>Stamped</em> & More</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In the northeastern London borough of Redbridge, a community arts program has transformed a simple electric truck into a vibrant, mobile artwork. Clad in richly embellished metal panels, the touring project is titled “Home Away from Home” and is inspired by the vivid, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/08/christopher-herwig-trucks-tuks/\">hand-embellished trucks</a> found in South Asia, especially around Pakistan and India.</p>\n<p>“Home Away from Home” is the final installment of a broader series of social art presentations called <em>Other Worlds</em>, organized by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://coloursofredbridge.com/\">Colours of Redbridge</a>. The local charity is part of a broader Arts Council England program called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/creative-people-and-places-0\">Creative People and Places</a>, which focuses on bringing arts and culture to communities where involvement in mainstream culture and creative expression is low relative to others.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of the front of a colorful van that has been transformed into an artwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-640x406.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-960x609.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-768x487.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-1536x974.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>The ornate truck was “designed by local groups to reflect what home means to them, exploring local heritage and identity in Redbridge, East London,” the organization says. “Bespoke panels reflect different themes such as music, sports, local landmarks, pets, and food—all of which are important to local community members and where they live.”</p>\n<p>Abid Bhai, an accomplished truck artist, created the panels in Pakistan, then shipped them to the U.K., where local blacksmith Felicity Jones affixed the colorful elements to the sides, top, and even the wheels. London-based artists Momtaz Begum-Hossain, Sheyamali Sudesh, and Bailes+Light were also instrumental in the collaborative work. “I’ve especially loved running the community metal workshops, where participants poured their own ideas into custom panel designs,” Jones says.”Seeing people grow in confidence and express themselves creatively through metalwork has been a real highlight.”</p>\n<p>Both Colours and Redbridge and Creative People and Places aim to not only break down barriers to the arts but to listen to residents’ real needs and wants. The overarching goal is to build and sustain healthier and happier communities. Through public engagement, the Colours of Redbridge also adheres to a mission “to reduce the impacts of the key issues residents face, such as the cost of living, health and wellbeing, or gaining skills and employment.”</p>\n<p>The inaugural appearance of “Home Away from Home’s” included dance performances, music, craft workshops with artist Zareena Bano, and more.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>With its roots in the conceptual and immersive experiments of the Dadaists and Surrealists in the early 20th century, installation art emerged as its own genre in the late 1950s. The approach gained momentum during the next couple of decades, usually revolving around site-specific responses to interior spaces. Taking many forms, installations sometimes incorporate light, sound, projections, performances, and participatory or immersive elements.</p>\n<p>“While many of these works were made by women, histories of art have<br />tended to focus on male artists,” says a statement from <a href=\"https://www.mplus.org.hk/en/\" target=\"_blank\">M+</a> in Hong Kong, which is currently presenting <em>Dream Rooms: Environments by Women Artists 1950s-Now</em>.

Reproduced by permission from The Monacelli Press. All rights reserved.</em> <em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Jeffrey Deitch:</strong> Nina, I’ve always been inspired by your expansive vision of what an artist can do. Your achievement in painting and works on paper is really outstanding—as is your NFT startup; your interest in multiples—but I’m very curious about your interest in public art murals. We did several of them together; so Iʼd like to ask you to start [by speaking] about this expansive vision you have about being an artist and reaching a broad public.</p>\n<p><strong>Nina Chanel Abney:</strong> I think it first comes out of my natural inclination to work in many different mediums. Growing up and looking at [the work of] Henri Matisse and Andy Warhol, my understanding of a masterful artist was an artist who evolved their practice through experimentation with different mediums. When I knew I wanted to be an artist, I aspired to have a career in which each body of work propels my practice forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> I remember a discussion we had some years ago about proposing a balloon for the Macyʼs Thanksgiving Day Parade. They didn’t understand how great you were, but I was very impressed then—and that was some years ago—very impressed by your ambition to reach people with your art.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I have always appreciated graffiti artists and their ability to reach a broad audience. The idea that anyone could access art just by walking by it and the idea of being able to share my work with a larger public has become more interesting for me, showing people how you can discover art in the everyday—whether thatʼs a sneaker or a billboard. I am always looking to find new ways to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Our first project together was <a href=\"https://ninachanel.com/viewing-room/4-coney-island-art-walls-brooklyn-new-york/\" target=\"_blank\">your great mural</a> at Coney Island. Somehow, I had the instinct that we had to position you right at the center, give you the great entrance wall, and your work was phenomenal.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Was that one of the first public murals you did?</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> Yes, it was one of the first. The very first one I did was in Newark, New Jersey, off of McCarter Highway with Project for Empty Space. They did a program where they worked with about eighteen different artists through a long span of the highway, and each artist got a section of the wall. When given the opportunity, I said, “Of course I’ll do it.” </p>\n<p>Most everyone involved was a full-time graffiti artist. I completely underestimated what the project would entail. We were working crazy hours to avoid traffic, basically midnight to 5:00 a.m. It was about 1:00 a.m. and I went there with spray paint in hand, arrogantly thinking I could just start working directly on the wall. I realized, “Oh my God this is… an entire other way of working, a talent I don’t have.” I was on the verge of tears, panicking at 3:00 in the morning on the side of the highway, thinking, “I don’t even know how to do this.” It was a learning curve.</p>\n<p>In that moment, I had to figure out how to translate my work into a large-scale mural. Thatʼs when I began using tape and creating stencils to adapt my imagery to a larger scale. That was the very first mural. After I conquered the first mural, I did one in Detroit with Library Street Collective and Coney Island came after. Fortunately, every opportunity led to another, allowing me to improve my technique along the way. I might still do a balloon [for the Macyʼs parade]. I found a loophole, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> That would be very exciting. I love how you think. By the time you did your third mural at Coney Island, you had totally perfected it. It was incredible and so impressive to see you and your team. We more recently did this project in Miami with two gigantic multi-story walls and a tunnel, and that was phenomenal. It was amazing to see how you had put together this team that allows you to create massive works of public art.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney: </strong>At first, I was doing the murals with one studio assistant, which was labor intensive because I work intuitively. It truly felt like doing an extremely large painting in a very condensed timeline, sometimes less than a week. It didn’t seem sustainable. Also, I realized that maybe I’m a little afraid of heights. Thatʼs when I came up with a different strategy.</p>\n<p>My friend JJ, who helps me manage my mural projects, introduced me to an amazing team of women painters who are capable of working on the side of skyscrapers with no fear. Theyʼre badass and have been helping me paint murals ever since. There’s great synergy.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1.jpg\" alt=\"an aerial image of a painted basketball court by Nina Chanel Abney\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1-640x354.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1-960x531.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1-768x425.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1-1536x850.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mural for the Morrison Residence Hall basketball court (2018).

Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professor, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Oh, thatʼs fascinating. Iʼd like to talk about how you approach the work. I read in a previous interview that you do not do preparatory sketches. Is that correct? It seemed with the complexity your work, one would think that there are numerous preparatory sketches.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> There are not. If I sketched the piece beforehand, Iʼd lose interest and wouldn’t want to paint it. The excitement for me comes from the unknown—the spontaneity and problem-solving in the moment to create a cohesive composition.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Thatʼs extraordinary. It’s very rare that an artist can create these large-scale complex works without numerous preparatory drawings. I’ve seen that with Keith Haring, who would be able to start a large painting or mural in the upper left corner and move across, but thatʼs amazing that this is all internalized. It’s almost like a jazz improvisation that you do.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> Each painting becomes a puzzle for me to solve.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Something that I admire immensely in your work is the inherent rhythm of the composition: in classic critical art terms, one talks about the color, the edge, things that you associate with painting. Rhythm does not generally come up, but thatʼs something thatʼs so inherent in your work. Looking at a large painting of yours, I can see it move. I can feel the rhythm. Iʼd like to ask you about that aspect of your work, because thatʼs quite unique.</p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>The excitement for me comes from the unknown—the spontaneity and problem-solving in the moment to create a cohesive composition.</p>Nina Chanel Abney</blockquote></figure>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> The work is rhythmic because I aim to create movement across the canvas so that the viewer’s gaze is never stagnant. To achieve this, I have created systems and techniques that utilize color, shape, repetition, and text. I want the work to keep your attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Do you have a background as an athlete or a dancer? The rhythm is so physical.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I played tennis. I still play tennis. I played soccer, basketball… I was always very athletic when I was younger, and I play the piano.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> I didn’t know that. Do you have a classical training or was it more jazz piano?</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> Classical, but I have always wanted to learn jazz. I have several cousins who were self-taught jazz [musicians].</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Your improvisational talent goes into the painting?</p>\n<p><strong>Abney: </strong>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Thatʼs so fascinating, because your paintings do have a sound, in a way.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I would love to learn jazz. I recently bought some books and a piano to try to teach myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Did you get to the point where you were a performer also or was it more just your own study?</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> With classical, I performed in recitals as a kid with my stepsister, who was, at the time, learning opera. It’s so wild when I think about it. We would do some recitals together, I would play and she would sing. Outside of that, after a certain point, I didn’t really take it up. I feel like I quit after I realized I needed glasses or something. That was in the ’80s, early childhood, but I kept with it. I can still play now.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Let’s talk about your trajectory. There’s an unusual year where you worked in a Ford factory, one of the only contemporary artists I know who actually had that kind of experience. It seems that and other aspects of your background had given you a sympathy for the working class. Your art addresses everyday people in the city, not only the art elite.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I am everyday people, I come from everyday people. My mom worked for almost forty years at the unemployment agency, my stepfather delivered Pepsi®. I come from humble beginnings, so being catapulted into this elite art world has been interesting. I still feel like an outsider sometimes, though I am a part of this “art world.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-4.jpg\" alt=\"a triptych of Black people by Nina Chanel Abney\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-4-640x351.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-4-960x527.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-4-768x422.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-4-1536x843.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Untitled” (2019), monoprints, 65⅞ × 118⅞ inches.

Iʼd like to ask you about how you integrate messaging with the formal aspects of the work.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> My whole way of working, from color, humor, and seducing the viewer into challenging topics in a way in which they want to stay, comes from my own experience with artwork. I noticed that with works that are overly didactic, people tend not to spend much time with them since they feel like they already have the work figured out. I want to create work that can be visually engaging: it can make you think, but also, provoke self-interrogation.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> It’s also fascinating the way you invite entry into the work by your use of humor.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> When I was younger, I wanted to be a cartoonist. I love the most sarcastic animations. I was a big fan of Hanna-Barbera. Thatʼs where I got my sense of humor. With animation, you can walk the line of inappropriateness. I’m interested in that play, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Do you have some plans for an animated film?</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I actually wrote a cartoon with my partner, Jet Toomer, and our friend, Zoe Lister-Jones. We wrote a cartoon based off me and my younger sister’s relationship, but we threw a wrench in. We have turned the family structure thatʼs usually depicted in animation on its head.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> It sounds brilliant. Maybe I can help you to make that happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> Maybe. I’m even thinking maybe a short film, centered around the same concept, and would love to do it at the Sundance Film Festival because they have an animation program. The film industry, from what I’ve learned, is so different, even in the approach to ownership and intellectual property. I feel like I’m more independent-minded when it comes to that, where Iʼd rather take the time and do it myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Well, thatʼs one of the greatest things about being an artist: You do not have a boss. Nobody’s telling you what you can do.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I don’t want to have to compromise my vision to make things more mainstream. When you’re not conforming, people might see it as risky, but there are communities that are rarely considered in film and television and thatʼs who I would like to prioritize.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Fascinating. I anticipate you will be able to realize this.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I hope so.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-3.jpg\" alt=\"a piece that says \"WATCH OUT FOR THE OTHER GUY\" with Black people below by Nina Chanel Abney\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-3-640x853.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-3-960x1280.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-3-1536x2048.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Guns and Butter” (2017), Unique UltraChrome pigmented print, acrylic, and spray paint on canvas, 96 × 72 inches.

I imagine you’ve deeply studied Pablo Picasso, Romare Bearden, Stuart Davis… I want to ask you about these art historical references that you build on, that are inside your work, that you must have studied.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> Actually, funny story, Stuart Davis… I hadn’t even heard of him until I was working on a show called I DREAD TO THINK [October 18 – November 24, 2012, at Kravets Wehby Gallery, in collaboration with Anna Kustera Gallery, New York, NY]. When I was working on that show, Lowery Stokes Sims came to my studio and brought up Stuart Davis, assuming I was aware of his work. Immediately after that, I was obsessed. I didn’t know much about contemporary art until I came to New York for graduate school at Parsons School of Design. </p>\n<p>The first show I went to was a Marina Abramović performance at the Guggenheim and my mind was blown. Parsons was an intense education because I was playing catch up to the contemporary art history while trying to become a contemporary artist, myself.</p>\n<p>My references came from what was available to me when I was younger. I mean, everyone knows Picasso. I had field trips to the Art Institute of Chicago, where I learned about Chuck Close and Georges Seurat. I had some exposure to Black artists through <em>The Cosby Show</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Really? From the TV show? Thatʼs fascinating. It must be thrilling for you to see your work influencing artists who are of the younger generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> It’s surreal to know that my work is being studied in classes. I still can’t believe it. Because I have become an influence to others, I feel a responsibility to keep pushing the boundaries of my own practice, exploring new mediums and delving into industries in which people who look like me aren’t represented. It’s crazy to think that I could be a part of art history. If you named the period of art we’re in now, what would it be? I don’t know…</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Well, you’re one of the people defining it. Fascinating to know that you studied both computer science and art, because most artists, if you ask, “What did you study?” they’ll probably say poetry and art. I think maybe part of the rigor thatʼs in your work comes from this study of computer science. Could you elaborate a little bit about that, about the dual mind that you bring to your artwork?</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I intended on being a computer programmer because I couldn’t fathom having a career as an artist. I didn’t know how artists made money and I needed a sustainable job, but I didn’t like going to work. When I started the major, however, I quickly thought, “This isn’t for me.” It was hours of trying to figure out a program that may simply not work because of a missing semicolon.</p>\n<p>Everything happens for a reason. My grades were horrible. I was barely holding onto my computer science major. And just when I thought things couldn’t get worse, I was helping a friend with his homework and he accidentally turned in a copy of my homework as his. When I get my assignment back from the professor, I have a big F written in red marker. I look at my friend like, “What happened?” The professor had circled my name on his paper—he also had an F. It was a major assignment, and she would not change my grade. That class was so vital, it put my major in jeopardy, so I dropped computer science and focused on art.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to be a graphic designer. I was learning how to design websites during my summers off. I thought, “Graphic design, thatʼs how I’ll get paid as an artist,” but when I got out of undergrad, I got pretty much rejected from every graphic design program I applied to. I worked for a little bit and thatʼs when I said, “Maybe I’ll try painting.” Thatʼs how that all came about.</p>\n<p>I still have a definite interest in graphic design… I feel like most people don’t realize that we were all teaching ourselves HTML code to create cool pages on Black Planet. We were learning HTML to play music play or feature graphics on our social media pages. I was fascinated by it.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-5.jpg\" alt=\"four men in preppy clothes gather on a plaid background in a work by Nina Chanel Abney\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-5-640x438.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-5-960x657.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-5-768x526.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-5-1536x1051.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“I Am- Somebody” (2022), ciptych collage on panel, 85¾ × 61½ × 1⅜ inches each.

It’s very interesting to see how your work has evolved. The figures were much looser, Iʼd say a little less rhythmic in the composition, and progressively become more abstracted, the rhythms more complex. Iʼd like to ask you about the evolution of your work over this period.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> My work was always critiqued for being too flat, so I had a specific preconceived notion of what a “good” painting was, and that was one that was rendered realistically. The earlier work is a by-product of this mentality. Over the last twenty years, I have been moving away from this way of thinking and towards abstraction, which I feel is more freeing.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> You’ve evolved a completely unique style thatʼs only you, that is instantly recognizable, which is quite an achievement.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney: </strong>Thank you. It’s been a long journey to block out the noise and be in tune with my own voice.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> You have your own artistic vocabulary thatʼs yours. It’s remarkable. Very few artists can achieve that.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney: </strong>Thanks. I’m still trying to unlearn a few things that have been restrictive to my practice, but I feel like I’m now at 80 percent of my true artist voice. There’s still work to be done.</p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>How do I break this down to the simplest form? I try to remove unnecessary information to create a language that becomes universal.</p>Nina Chanel Abney</blockquote></figure>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> It’s good that you still have another 20 percent to achieve. Something that fascinates me is that you’ve been able to put together a narrative, where some of your work tells a story with an abstract set of images. Thatʼs quite rare to be able to be narrative, bold, and abstract at the same time. I think thatʼs quite an achievement.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> When approaching my work that is representational, I aim to figure out the least amount of information needed. Thatʼs how I approach the imagery in my work now. For example, what’s the least amount of information needed for one to register a figure? How do I break this down to the simplest form? I try to remove unnecessary information to create a language that becomes universal.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Another characteristic of your work is the integration of text. You’re using text almost as an abstraction, but it also becomes an essential part of the narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I started using text because there are certain things I felt I just couldn’t paint. Some things just need to be said plainly. I also see letters and numbers as forms and shapes. I’m also interested in the use of text in advertisements.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> I look at your work as taking Pop art into the present.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I love Pop art, so thatʼs what I would hope to be achieving right now with my current work.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney.jpg\" alt=\"a portrait of Nina Chanel Abney\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-640x800.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-960x1200.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/abney-1638x2048.jpg 1638w\" /><figcaption>The artist. Photo by Todd Midler</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> You’re expanding into other media—some ambitious sculpture is coming. Iʼd like to ask you about your sculpture in relationship to the painting.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I’ve always wanted to work in sculpture, but I was waiting until the right moment. I could not figure how I could organically translate my paintings to sculpture. I had no idea what my sculpture was going to look like. It took so much time to figure it out and now it’s finally here.<br />I took the first step by making a vinyl toy, which allowed me to see how my work could look three-dimensionally. That was the start and things have been quickly evolving. In the past year alone, I’ve made over ten sculptural works. Eventually, I want to do large public sculpture that can be interactive. I’m not necessarily interested in creating monuments, but works that people can sit on, sculpture that is functional.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> I read some exciting news this week about your being selected as one of the artists commissioned for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/jane-dickson-artists-jfk-public-art-commission-new-york-1234730380/\" target=\"_blank\">New York’s new John F. Kennedy International Airport terminal</a>. It seemed that you were thinking of doing a sculpture.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I am. I’m working with a material I’ve never worked with before, stained glass, inspired by New York City iconography.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> That will be brilliant. Now, we’re here at Pace Prints in New York City for this conversation, and you’ve really reinvented how to make a print, how to make collage. I’m fascinated by how you’ve taken this well-traveled medium of all the artists who have made prints or works on paper and you’ve done it in a fresh way.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I held out for years when it came to doing prints. Many printmakers or print shops would approach me and say, “You know, your work would translate so well to print-making,” and I would turn them down in hopes of working specifically with Pace Prints. Also, my understanding of prints was limited. When I thought of an edition, I only thought of an image of an existing work. So for the longest time, I was not interested in doing this.</p>\n<p>I got a C in my printmaking class. I didn’t have enough patience for the process. I did an etching, and it was the most tedious thing, so I never thought I would end up loving printmaking. Fortunately, I was introduced to [President of Pace Prints] Jacob Lewis and the printmakers of Pace Prints. I was blown away by the work that they were doing.</p>\n<p>We started working together, and it’s such a collaborative process. We challenge each other to think beyond traditional printmaking and create unique works that explore collage and expand the conversation around paper as a medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Well, your prints have the impact of complex paintings.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> Thatʼs what we hope to achieve.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Of all the important contemporary artists I follow, your work is sexier than almost anyone else’s, but it’s never vulgar. Iʼd like to ask you about how you insert the sexuality and the sexual power in the work in this strong way thatʼs elegant and impactful, but never vulgar.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> It comes from a sincere place of wanting to destigmatize the idea that sexuality is vulgar… and thatʼs one of the reasons I moved to New York—it’s forward-thinking energy fosters self-expression and challenges outdated norms.</p>\n<p>I’ve always wanted to tell you that when I first came [to New York] to go to graduate school, your gallery was one of the first that I went to. You had a show with Kehinde Wiley with a band that performed on Wooster Street and that blew my mind. It was a very impactful experience that expanded what I thought of art as an expression and as a career.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> That was our goal, to inspire people. I really, really love hearing that it had such an impact on you.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I have always wanted to work with you because your exhibitions are ambitious, fun, smart, and not so uptight. With our February 2025 show [<a href=\"https://ninachanel.com/exhibitions/34-winging-it-jeffrey-deitch-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\">Winging It</a>], it’s a full circle moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> Let’s close by talking about what you hope to realize in the next few years, expanding your work, both pushing the painting practice and also expanding into more popular areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Abney:</strong> I want to prioritize sculpture and public work in the coming years. Right now, I’m very interested in installation. I’ve been thinking about Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Rooms—something more experiential that can travel. Also, animation production, and I can do something new in that space that hasn’t been done before. I’m also very much interested in creating more products, specifically, sneakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Deitch:</strong> A lot to look forward to.</p>\n<p><em>Pick up a copy of </em>Nina Chanel Abney<em>, which will be released on October 23, in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colossal.shop/collections/books/products/nina-chanel-abney-monograph-pre-order\">Colossal Shop</a>.

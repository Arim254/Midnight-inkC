    "body": "\n            Sometimes you wake up to news headlines that don't make any sense. Take this one, for example: South Africa Axes Venice Biennale Proposal Centering Gaza Victims. You ask yourself: Wait a second, isn't South Africa the same country that accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice? Yes, it is, but it happens to have a right-wing arts and culture minister who found artist Gabrielle Goliath’s performance piece “highly divisive in nature.” He later came up with the bizarre, unfounded claim that a “foreign power” was involved in the artwork. Writer and scholar Christina Sharpe and University of Buffalo professor Rinaldo Walcott saw this and felt an immediate urge to respond. In a must-read piece this week, they lament a world in which the country that toppled Apartheid abandons its own revolutionary legacy. Meanwhile, the White House brings the Smithsonian to its knees, forcing the DC institution to submit all information — down to wall-label texts — about its programming to make sure it aligns with the president's worldview. Brace yourself for a lineup of unironic shows about American exceptionalism with gold cursive titles.   —Hakim Bishara, editor-in-chief\nA visitor at Personal Accounts (2024) by Gabrielle Goliath at the previous Venice Biennale exhibition in April 2024 (photo by Gabriel Bouys/AFP via Getty Images)The South African Pavilion Is Betraying Its Own History\"South Africa’s cancellation of Elegy threatens to join the ignoble set of actions meant to disappear Gaza and Palestinians from the art world’s public sphere,\" write Christina Sharpe and Rinaldo Walcott. \"To say that this action is like a tremor from the trauma of the genocide-in-progress is not to overstate the shattering effect of an official acting as a censor on behalf of the same government whose case against Israeli acts of genocide compelled the world to bear witness.\"\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Sandcastles Tells the Tale of Two SingaporesThe new short from documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist Carin Leong explores the transient nature of humankind’s existence through sand.\n                        \n                        \n                            Learn more\n                        \n                    \n            News Demonstrators protesting against Trump's executive actions aimed at the Smithsonian institution on May 3, 2025, in Washington, DC (photo by Craig Hudson/Washington Post via Getty Images)The Smithsonian Institution has handed over information about its wall texts, curation, and exhibition schedule as part of the White House's targeted inquiry into the museum system.South Africa has scrapped a performance centering Israel's genocide in Gaza planned for the country's 2026 Venice Biennale pavilion.

(illustration by Shari Flores/Hyperallergic)Why Are We Paying for the Privilege of Rejection?Artist Damien Davis is back with an impassioned takedown of that most ubiquitous of art-world barriers: application fees. Far from a minor constraint, they pile up quickly and train artists \"to treat unpaid administrative labor as a prerequisite for being seen.\" Read his essay for guidelines on identifying predatory fees and working against the normalization of \"access as something artists should pay for in advance.\"Curating a Show on My Ineffable Mother, Ursula K. Le GuinHow does one curate a show about a parent? Theo Downes-Le Guin began this daunting task last year while organizing an exhibition about the singular Ursula K. Le Guin, who constantly remade herself and detested being pigeon-holed. It's fitting, then, that her own typewriter would be on view for visitors to leave their own mark on the show, changing it with each word they write.

ThomasRepatriation: The GameNomali and crew members in Relooted (2025) teaser photoA Video Game Lets You Take Back Looted ArtifactsBernard Dayo introduces readers to a new game in which players join a heist crew — consisting of hackers, acrobats, a museum insider, and even a grandma — to infiltrate museums and take back looted African artifacts, such as a drum sacred to the Shona people now in the British Museum. But there's more than a heist at stake. Users must learn musical rhythms, consult elders, and participate in ceremonies to reactivate the social meaning of these objects.On January 6, Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as mayor of New York City with his hand resting on a special edition of the Qur'an, now on view at the New York Public Library's flagship location.

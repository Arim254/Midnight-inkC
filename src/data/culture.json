    "body": "\n\tin Archaeology, History, Life |   \tDecember 11th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nThe site Fast Com­pa­ny pub­lished an arti­cle that describes the “Com­plaint Restraint project,” an ini­tia­tive that aims to cre­ate a “pos­i­tive life by elim­i­nat­ing neg­a­tive state­ments.” It’s an admirable goal. Though most of us have a per­verse love of wal­low­ing in our misery—a human trait ampli­fied a thou­sand­fold by the internet—complaining rarely makes things any bet­ter. As in the Buddha’s para­ble of the “sec­ond arrow,” our grip­ing can make our suf­fer­ings dou­bly painful; as in the para­ble of the “poi­soned arrow,” it can post­pone or sub­sti­tute for the con­struc­tive actions we need to take in order to heal or improve our con­di­tion.\nBut it would be a mis­take to think that com­plain­ing is some­how a recent phe­nom­e­non, though we may hear more of it every day, all the time, from every quar­ter of the globe. The Bud­dhist arrow sto­ries are, after all, at least a cou­ple thou­sand years old; lamen­ta­tion more or less con­sti­tutes its own genre in Bib­li­cal lit­er­a­ture.\nEven old­er still than these reli­gious sources is the first doc­u­ment­ed cus­tomer ser­vice com­plaint, a spe­cif­ic vari­ety of com­plain­ing that we might be for­giv­en for asso­ci­at­ing main­ly with a mod­ern, con­sumerist age—and one of the few kinds of com­plaints that can gen­er­ate pos­i­tive results.\nAbsent a Yelp app, the ancient Baby­lon­ian con­sumer in this case inscribed his com­plaint on a clay tablet—which now resides at the British Muse­um—some­time around 1750 B.C. The irate pur­chas­er here, Nan­ni, writ­ing to some­one named Ea-nasir, received a ship­ment of cop­per ore of an infe­ri­or grade, after some annoy­ing delay and in a dam­aged con­di­tion. In the trans­la­tion below from Assyri­ol­o­gist A. Leo Oppen­heim, Nan­ni vents his spleen.\nTell Ea-nasir: Nan­ni sends the fol­low­ing mes­sage:\nWhen you came, you said to me as fol­lows : “I will give Gim­il-Sin (when he comes) fine qual­i­ty cop­per ingots.” You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my mes­sen­ger (Sit-Sin) and said: “If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!”\nWhat do you take me for, that you treat some­body like me with such con­tempt? I have sent as mes­sen­gers gen­tle­men like our­selves to col­lect the bag with my mon­ey (deposit­ed with you) but you have treat­ed me with con­tempt by send­ing them back to me emp­ty-hand­ed sev­er­al times, and that through ene­my ter­ri­to­ry. Is there any­one among the mer­chants who trade with Tel­mun who has treat­ed me in this way? You alone treat my mes­sen­ger with con­tempt! On account of that one (tri­fling) mina of sil­ver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have giv­en to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of cop­per, and umi-abum has like­wise giv­en 1,080 pounds of cop­per, apart from what we both have had writ­ten on a sealed tablet to be kept in the tem­ple of Samas.\nHow have you treat­ed me for that cop­per? You have with­held my mon­ey bag from me in ene­my ter­ri­to­ry; it is now up to you to restore (my mon­ey) to me in full.\nTake cog­nizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any cop­per from you that is not of fine qual­i­ty. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots indi­vid­u­al­ly in my own yard, and I shall exer­cise against you my right of rejec­tion because you have treat­ed me with con­tempt.\nIt does seem that Nan­ni maybe took this poor ser­vice a lit­tle too per­son­al­ly. In any case, let’s hope he received some sat­is­fac­tion for the trou­ble it must have tak­en to inscribe this angry mes­sage.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMark Twain Drafts the Ulti­mate Let­ter of Com­plaint (1905)\nHunter S.

    "body": "\n\tin Animation, Art, Film |   \tDecember 11th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nYou may have seen every sin­gle one of Stu­dio Ghi­b­li’s ani­mat­ed films, going well beyond the Hayao Miyaza­ki-direct­ed My Neigh­bor Totoro, Spir­it­ed Away, and Kik­i’s Deliv­ery Ser­vice to the less wide­ly known but also charm­ing­ly craft­ed likes of Ocean Waves, My Neigh­bors the Yamadas, and The Cat Returns. Even so, the ques­tion remains: have you real­ly seen them all? Expe­ri­enc­ing them in the the­ater or on home video is only the first stage of the process. Ide­al­ly, each ele­ment of a Ghi­b­li movie should sub­se­quent­ly be appre­ci­at­ed in iso­la­tion and at length: by lis­ten­ing to the music, for exam­ple, hun­dreds of hours of which, avail­able to stream, we’ve pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture.\n\nStill, no mat­ter how cap­ti­vat­ing Joe Hisaishi’s scores may sound on their own, Ghi­b­li’s work is ulti­mate­ly made to be seen. Giv­en that 24 frames of their movies go by each sec­ond, it can be dif­fi­cult to pick up all the details their ani­ma­tors include in each and every one of them.\nHence the val­ue of the free archive of stills that the stu­dio first made avail­able online a few years ago, and that has steadi­ly expand­ed ever since. Though only avail­able in Japan­ese, it does­n’t present a great chal­lenge even to fans with no knowl­edge of the lan­guage to click on the poster of their Ghi­b­li film of choice, then to browse the vari­ety of down­load­able images asso­ci­at­ed with it.\n\nMany of these stills are drawn from high­ly mem­o­rable moments across the Ghi­b­li fil­mog­ra­phy: the chil­dren’s par­ty on the hero of Por­co Rosso’s beloved air­plane; the emer­gence of the kodama in Princess Mononoke; the defeat of the colos­sal Giant War­rior in Nau­si­caä of the Val­ley of the Wind (which pre­dates the stu­dio’s foun­da­tion, but in any case now seems to count hon­orar­i­ly among its pro­duc­tions); the sen­tient flame cook­ing a skil­let of bacon and eggs in Howl’s Mov­ing Cas­tle. Some of them have even been turned into wall­pa­per for video calls, down­load­able from a page of their own. There we have anoth­er way to add a touch of Stu­dio Ghi­b­li’s dis­tinc­tive vision to our every­day lives — and anoth­er source of inspi­ra­tion to watch through the movies them­selves one more time.\nEnter the archive of still images here.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nDe-Stress with 30 Min­utes of Relax­ing Visu­als from Direc­tor Hayao Miyaza­ki\nA Vir­tu­al Tour Inside the Hayao Miyazaki’s Stu­dio Ghi­b­li Muse­um\nA Tour of Stu­dio Ghibli’s Brand New Theme Park in Japan, Which Re-Cre­ates the Worlds of Spir­it­ed Away, My Neigh­bor Totoro, and Oth­er Clas­sics\nSoft­ware Used by Hayao Miyazaki’s Ani­ma­tion Stu­dio Becomes Open Source & Free to Down­load\nStream Hun­dreds of Hours of Stu­dio Ghi­b­li Movie Music That Will Help You Study, Work, or Sim­ply Relax: My Neigh­bor Totoro, Spir­it­ed Away & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Archaeology, History |   \tDecember 12th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWe did­n’t have civ­i­liza­tion until we had cities, and we did­n’t have cities until we had agri­cul­ture. So, at least, goes a wide­ly accept­ed nar­ra­tive in “big his­to­ry” — a nar­ra­tive some­what trou­bled by the dis­cov­ery of ruins on Göbek­li Tepe, or “Pot­bel­ly Hill,” in south­east­ern Turkey. Appar­ent­ly inhab­it­ed from around 9500 to 8000 BC, the ancient set­tle­ment pre­dates the Pyra­mids of Giza by near­ly 8,000 years, and Stone­henge by about 6,000 years. Though it was once believed to be a site used for rit­u­al pur­pos­es only, lat­er research unearthed evi­dence that sug­gests it was host to a vari­ety of activ­i­ties we asso­ciate with urban civ­i­liza­tion, rather than what we usu­al­ly think of hunter-gath­er­er sites. Does it amount to rea­son enough to revise our very under­stand­ing of the his­to­ry of human­i­ty?\n“Like Stone­henge, Göbek­li Tepe’s struc­ture includes cir­cles of T‑shaped lime­stone pil­lars, many of them fea­tur­ing etch­ings of ani­mals,” says YouTu­ber Joe Scott in the video above. These pil­lars are arranged into enclo­sures, which togeth­er con­sti­tute a site that “fea­tures archae­o­log­i­cal com­plex­i­ty that prob­a­bly would have been too advanced for hunter-gath­er­ers.”\nKlaus Schmidt, the archae­ol­o­gist who led the exca­va­tions at Göbek­li Tepe between 1996 and 2014, believed that it was “a sanc­tu­ary and maybe a region­al pil­grim­age cen­ter where peo­ple gath­ered to per­form reli­gious rites.” But since his death, evi­dence of hous­es, a cis­tern, and grain-pro­cess­ing tools has turned up, indi­cat­ing “a ful­ly fledged set­tle­ment with per­ma­nent occu­pa­tion” well before the advent of farm­ing. This find­ing indi­cates that social and tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tions asso­ci­at­ed with ‘civ­i­liza­tion’ may have emerged long before the advent of agri­cul­ture, cities, or domes­ti­cat­ed ani­mals — under con­di­tions very dif­fer­ent from what his­to­ri­ans had pre­vi­ous­ly assumed. But as to the rea­son it was all built in the first place, this new infor­ma­tion has led to more ques­tions than answers.\nOne less than gen­er­al­ly accept­ed the­o­ry holds that Göbek­li Tepe was an astro­nom­i­cal obser­va­to­ry, and per­haps also a memo­r­i­al to a dev­as­tat­ing comet strike that occurred 13,000 years ago. Maybe it was “a last-ditch effort by a hunter-gath­er­er soci­ety to hang on to their van­ish­ing lifestyle as the world was tran­si­tion­ing to farm­ing.” That could have been the first large-scale tech­no­log­i­cal rev­o­lu­tion in human his­to­ry, but it cer­tain­ly would­n’t be the last, and as we here in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­sid­er the ruins of Göbek­li Tepe — most of which still have yet to be exca­vat­ed — we nat­u­ral­ly find our­selves think­ing about the long-term sur­vival prospects of our own civ­i­liza­tion. But the more recent dis­cov­ery else­where in Turkey of oth­er, even old­er ruins with a dis­tinct­ly urban struc­ture may also make us feel that our way of life isn’t quite as mod­ern as we’d imag­ined.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nExplore the Ruins of Tim­gad, the “African Pom­peii” Exca­vat­ed from the Sands of Alge­ria\nWatch Ancient Ruins Get Restored to their Glo­ri­ous Orig­i­nal State with Ani­mat­ed GIFs: The Tem­ple of Jupiter, Lux­or Tem­ple & More\nPom­peii Rebuilt: A Tour of the Ancient City Before It Was Entombed by Mount Vesu­vius\nHow Civ­i­liza­tions Built on Top of Each Oth­er: Dis­cov­er What Lies Beneath Rome, Troy & Oth­er Cities\nA Cul­tur­al Tour of Istan­bul, Where the Art and His­to­ry of Three Great Empires Come Togeth­er\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er a 2,400-Year-Old Skele­ton Mosa­ic That Urges Peo­ple to “Be Cheer­ful and Live Your Life”\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIf there’s a feeling that could sum up the whiplash of living online and off, it might be cognitive dissonance. This deep sense of unease emerges when our actions and beliefs don’t align or when something we’d previously thought true is proven false. Psychology tells us that the constructive way to deal with this unwanted feeling is to incorporate the new information into our lives, instead of pretending it doesn’t exist or continuing to believe something inaccurate.\nIn an era of AI slop and conspiracy theories ruling the highest levels of government, cognitive dissonance will likely be a fixture of contemporary life for the foreseeable future. It’s also an apt title for a new body of work by Los Angeles-based artist Seonna Hong opening this month at Hashimoto Contemporary.\n“The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 72 x 60 inches\nHong, whose work in television and feature animation has won her an Emmy, is best known for her layered, autobiographical paintings. Abstract landscapes emerge through visible brushstrokes sweeping across the canvas, with tiny rainbows and spindly, barren trees dotting the scenes. The artist always adds figures last, rendering them in plain, monochromatic dresses with no discernible facial features.\nIn this new body of work, we witness tender moments of care and reciprocity amid environments riddled by unknown disasters. Hong frequently cites the growing threat of the climate crisis as a central point of her practice, and while environmental collapse is present in these new pieces, the artist also touches on the political situation in the U.S. and global struggles for life and dignity.\n“The Collision of Truths” and “Laotong” both feature women with clenched fists that signal a clear desire to fight, while other paintings portray a sense of community and compassion. “Eudaimonia,” for example, depicts a trio holding hands while climbing a steep, slippery incline. The title is an ancient Greek word that means the “highest human good,” a concept that seems to ground much of Hong’s new work. \nLike earlier paintings, those in Cognitive Dissonance play with contradictions: abstraction and figuration, the temporary and enduring, and desolation and care. But where Hong has previously presented environments as both keepers of memory and endless sites of possibility, these pieces feel more urgent, suggesting that when loss and hardship are omnipresent, we’ll need to rely on our bonds with each other to carry us through.\nCognitive Dissonance runs from December 13 to January 10 in New York. Follow Hong’s work on Instagram.\n“The Collision of Truths” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 30 x 40 inches\n“Sonder” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 60 x 72 inches\n“Saudade” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 11 x 14 inches\n“Laotong” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 14 x 11 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

But the material also has a dark legacy as a commodity cultivated by enslaved people, especially in South Carolina, to fulfill the public’s demand for fabrics in the unique color. For Ugandan artist Stacy Gillian Abe, the medium provides the conceptual foundation for an ongoing series of bold figurative paintings.\nCurrently on view in her solo exhibition, Garden of Blue Whispers at Unit,  provocative portrayals of Black women explore cultural heritage, history, gender, and personal memory. Individuals whose skin is a saturated blue signify what Abe calls a new “breed of Black” that “transcends social, cultural, and historical boundaries,” the gallery says, adding that while Abe nods to “a material that defined and confined the Black body through trade and labor, here it is reclaimed and reinterpreted.”\nAbe also incorporates delicately embroidered flora and fauna to her canvases, creating textural vines, flowers, birds, and other embellishments. Having learned embroidery from her mother, who in turn learned it from hers, and so on, the artist taps into the way practical mending and crafts are often passed down through generations via women. Abe also commemorates her late grandmother, juxtaposing the personal with the universal.\nIn acrylic, oil, and thread, the artist renders pensive scenes that recall experiences in her village in Uganda. The women in her paintings commune with the earth; they are relaxed yet attuned as they explore or lounge in the grass, in some cases bearing hooves for feet as if hybridized with their wild surroundings. Some sleep, and others gaze directly at the viewer with piercing recognition.\n“The Farmer’s Daughter 3” (2025) oil, acrylic, and hand-embroidered details on canvas, 200 x 150 centimeters\n“By delicately hand-stitching silk thread directly onto the canvas, the artist transforms this domestic ritual into a meditative dialogue on the position of the Black woman’s body within painterly space,” Unit says. “The canvas becomes a site of refuge—an imagined garden—where her figures can exist freely, unbound by the world’s constraints.”\nGarden of Blue Whispers continues through January 31 in London.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor Shuo Hao, finding the proper place is at the heart of her practice. The Chinese artist, who is currently based in Paris, has long been interested in the ancient text Yijing and how it offers a system of understanding for a world perpetually in flux. The cosmological book provides structure through the five elements—earth, water, air, fire, and metal—and also considers the relationships between humans and nature and the order of things, more broadly.\nShuo Hao works with antique furniture, typically sourced from auctions and second-hand shops. Wood worn with age is her preferred material, and most objects she selects date between the 16th and 20th centuries. Like much of her practice, choosing these objects emerges more from intuition rather than a desire for particular physical qualities. Focusing on their surfaces, she paints a paints a panel or door, transforming both prized and forgotten pieces into surreal works.\n\n“Sometimes it’s just a subconscious feeling that a certain arrangement works, and later, upon analyzing the structure of the materials, I find that it indeed does,” she tells Colossal. “So I trust intuition. Everything that comes directly from it feels natural and authentic.”\nDescribing her process as “a kind of self-repair,” Shuo Hao considers herself in the Jungian tradition—the Swiss psychologist also embraced the teachings of the Yijing—as she gathers and arranges pieces in a way that’s therapeutic. She adds: \n\nI search for the right parts to assemble a work, and each part reflects aspects of my own personality and experiences. When a piece is complete, it feels like an independent and complete personality has emerged, giving a sense of wholeness. I feel my breath flows more freely.\n\nSurreal in content and celestial in color, the paintings feature strange hybrid creatures and often nod to ancient mythmaking. There’s a three-headed dog evocative of the Greek Cerberus, the monstrous being that guards the underworld. Other works feature a sleek, Sphinx-like character lounging on lace, along with ouroboros snakes, disembodied hands, florals, and vessels. Rendered with a distinctive lustrous quality, Shuo Hao’s subject matter tends to conjure moments of transition, and likely, transformation.\n\nHaving closed a solo exhibition this fall, Shuo Hao is currently in her own phase of change as she reflects and reorients herself. Some of this occurs through writing, which the artist considers an essential companion to her painting practice. “I write daily—thoughts, stories—and each session gives me a strong feeling of being alive. Writing and painting interact and support each other,” she adds.\nFind much more of Shuo Hao’s work on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

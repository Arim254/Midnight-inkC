    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tFebruary 18th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n“Through­out U.S. his­to­ry, our mil­i­tary has been used not for moral pur­pos­es but to expand eco­nom­ic, polit­i­cal, and mil­i­tary pow­er,” says a car­toon Howard Zinn in Mike Konopacki’s 273-page com­ic book A People’s His­to­ry of Amer­i­can Empire. Writ­ten with Zinn and his­to­ri­an Paul Buh­le, the book adapts Zinn’s path­break­ing his­to­ry from below, A People’s His­to­ry of the Unit­ed States, and his auto­bi­og­ra­phy You Can’t Be Neu­tral on a Mov­ing Train in a direct exam­i­na­tion of the U.S. Imperi­um. Konopac­ki calls the book his “answer” to the text­books of “the pow­er struc­ture.”\nAbove, you can see a short video adap­ta­tion of some key text from A People’s His­to­ry of Amer­i­can Empire. Nar­rat­ed by Vig­go Mortensen, the video gives us a nut­shell ver­sion of Zinn’s cul­tur­al, polit­i­cal, and moral education—what the Ger­mans used to call bil­dung—as he grows from a some­what naive WWII bomber pilot, to a col­lege stu­dent on the G.I. Bill, to a grad­u­ate stu­dent, then pro­fes­sor, of his­to­ry.\nAlong the way he notices that the map in every text­book labeled “West­ern Expan­sion” shows “the march across the con­ti­nent as a nat­ur­al, almost bio­log­i­cal phe­nom­e­non”:\nThat huge acqui­si­tion of land called the Louisiana Pur­chase gave no hint of any­thing but vacant land acquired, no sense that this ter­ri­to­ry was occu­pied by hun­dreds of Indi­an tribes that would have to be anni­hi­lat­ed or forced out of their homes in what we now call eth­nic cleans­ing.\nZinn goes on to chart the rise of U.S. Impe­ri­al­ism into the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry as the increas­ing­ly mil­i­ta­rized nation seizes Mex­i­can ter­ri­to­ry and invades Cuba and the Philip­pines. Then we come to the osten­si­bly anti-com­mu­nist “police actions” in Korea and Viet­nam, and Zinn’s high­ly influ­en­tial 1967 book Viet­nam: The Log­ic of With­draw­al. When entrust­ed by Daniel Ells­berg with hun­dreds of pages of the Pen­ta­gon Papers, Zinn learns that the war in Viet­nam is large­ly waged for the same rea­sons as our oth­er impe­ri­al­ist moves abroad: the papers “spoke blunt­ly of the U.S. motives as a quest for tin, rub­ber, oil.”\nBut what of the war Zinn begins with, the war in which he fought? Near the end of the short film, he returns to his days as a WWII bomber, when he heard a fel­low pilot argue that the U.S. was as “moti­vat­ed by ambi­tions of con­trol and con­quest” as its ene­mies. He dis­agreed at the time, but in the inter­ven­ing years came to see his fel­low airman’s point. What we get with our ide­al­ism about any war, Zinn says, is a seem­ing “Impe­ri­al­ism lite,” whose motives are benign. Soft pow­er, we’ve been told (until recent­ly), wins the day. But peel back the cur­tain on our actions in the world, and we will see the same atroc­i­ties, the same cru­el­ties, and the same basic moti­va­tions as every oth­er act of impe­ri­al­ist aggres­sion.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHoward Zinn’s Rec­om­mend­ed Read­ing List for Activists Who Want to Change the World\nMatt Damon Reads Howard Zinn’s “The Prob­lem is Civ­il Obe­di­ence,” a Call for Amer­i­cans to Take Action\nSee Albert Camus’ His­toric Lec­ture, “The Human Cri­sis,” Per­formed by Actor Vig­go Mortensen\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Books |   \tFebruary 18th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe expres­sion “Don’t quit your day job” is often used as an insult, imply­ing that the recip­i­en­t’s cre­ative skills aren’t up to attract­ing a career-sup­port­ing audi­ence. But it can also be prac­ti­cal advice in cer­tain cas­es, espe­cial­ly those of artists pos­sessed of a sen­si­bil­i­ty too par­tic­u­lar and strange to bear direct expo­sure to the mar­ket­place. So it was with Hen­ry Darg­er, who delib­er­ate­ly passed his 81 years in near-absolute obscu­ri­ty, work­ing increas­ing­ly menial jan­i­to­r­i­al jobs by day and, when not attend­ing one of his five dai­ly mass­es, obsess­ing over his art the rest of the time. That art took var­i­ous forms, most notably The Sto­ry of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unre­al, of the Glandeco–Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebel­lion, which has been described as the longest work of fic­tion ever writ­ten — and the strangest.\nAs described in the video above from Fredrik Knud­sen (and in the 2004 fea­ture-length doc­u­men­tary In the Realms of the Unre­al), its 15,145 pages relate the adven­tures of a set of immac­u­late­ly vir­tu­ous lit­tle girls against the back­drop of an apoc­a­lyp­tic, ultra-vio­lent reli­gious war. When Darg­er’s land­lords dis­cov­ered the work after his death, they also turned up a vari­ety of draw­ings, paint­ings, and col­lages, many of them at least oblique­ly relat­ed to the sto­ry.\nAgainst back­drops alter­nate­ly idyl­lic and har­row­ing, the Vivian girls often appear naked, some­times bewil­der­ing­ly out­fit­ted with male gen­i­talia. Though clear­ly com­posed with­out for­mal train­ing of any kind, Darg­er’s visu­al com­po­si­tions demon­strate an askew kind of pro­fi­cien­cy, or at least a kind of stag­ger­ing evo­lu­tion over the course of decades. What­ev­er the appeal of his work, there’s nev­er been an artist like him. Nor could there be, giv­en the high­ly spe­cif­ic stretch of his­to­ry occu­pied by his long yet rigid­ly bound­ed life.\nNot long after Darg­er’s birth in the Chica­go of 1892, the death of his moth­er fol­lowed by the inca­pac­i­ta­tion of his father plunged him into a child­hood of Dick­en­sian-sound­ing hard­ship, spent in insti­tu­tions with names like the Illi­nois Asy­lum for Fee­ble-Mind­ed Chil­dren. An aggriev­ed lon­er seem­ing­ly afflict­ed by what we would now call men­tal health dif­fi­cul­ties from the start, he took a kind of refuge in the fan­ta­sy coher­ing in his head, one shaped equal­ly by mass print media phe­nom­e­na like Win­nie Win­kle and Lit­tle Annie Rooney, Civ­il War pho­tographs, and ultra-devout Catholi­cism. Since his posthu­mous dis­cov­ery and ele­va­tion to the sta­tus of the ulti­mate “out­sider artist,” there’s been no end of spec­u­la­tion about his per­son­al habits, sex­u­al pro­cliv­i­ties, and state of mind. But with all such ques­tions beyond res­o­lu­tion, we can, for the moment, leave the last word to the artist him­self: “It’s bet­ter to be a suck­er who makes some­thing than a wise guy who is too cau­tious to make any­thing at all.”\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMeet Hen­ry Darg­er, the Most Famous of Out­sider Artists, Who Died in Obscu­ri­ty, Leav­ing Behind Hun­dreds of Unseen Fan­ta­sy Illus­tra­tions and a 15,000-Page Nov­el\nThe Artistry of the Men­tal­ly Ill: The 1922 Book That Pub­lished the Fas­ci­nat­ing Work of Schiz­o­phrenic Patients, and Influ­enced Paul Klee, Wass­i­ly Kandin­sky & Oth­er Avant Garde Artists\nJapan­ese Artist Has Drawn Every Meal He’s Eat­en for 32 Years: Behold the Deli­cious Illus­tra­tions of Itsuo Kobayashi\nExplore a Dig­i­tized Edi­tion of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, “the World’s Most Mys­te­ri­ous Book”\nA Short Video Intro­duc­tion to Hilma af Klint, the Mys­ti­cal Female Painter Who Helped Invent Abstract Art\nLewis Carroll’s Pho­tographs of Alice Lid­dell, the Inspi­ra­tion for Alice in Won­der­land\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tFebruary 17th, 2026  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe appear­ance of the Dead Sea Scrolls was the most impor­tant doc­u­ment dis­cov­ery of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry. Yet, in some sense, they did­n’t deliv­er what many assumed to be promised with­in: that is, the basis for a com­plete revi­sion of every­thing we thought we knew about Chris­tian­i­ty. The real­i­ty of the Dead Sea Scrolls’ con­tent is less sim­ple, but also stranger — which makes it an ide­al sub­ject for the YouTube chan­nel Hochela­ga, giv­en its pen­chant for explor­ing the obscure byways of reli­gious his­to­ry. And indeed, as host Tom­mie Trelawny says in his new video above, they are the “old­est Bib­li­cal writ­ings ever found,” a sta­tus that, what­ev­er their specifics, cer­tain­ly jus­ti­fies the great scruti­ny paid to them over the past eight decades.\nFor it was only in 1946 that the Scrolls were found, by a Bedouin shep­herd look­ing for his lost goat in a series of caves in the vicin­i­ty of ancient ruins by the Dead Sea. Or so the sto­ry goes, any­way, and Trelawny explains some of the com­pli­ca­tions that emerge when it’s exam­ined more close­ly.\nBut the fact remains that those caves did con­tain, tight­ly rolled up and for the most part well-pre­served, a set of scrolls adding up to “around 900 indi­vid­ual man­u­scripts: 40 per­cent of them “resem­bled books found in the Bible”; 30 per­cent, apoc­ryphal writ­ings “banned” from the Bible; and anoth­er 30 per­cent, “writ­ings pre­vi­ous­ly unknown to schol­ar­ship.” Those last include “texts that described a secre­tive reli­gious com­mu­ni­ty and apoc­a­lyp­tic visions of a great heav­en­ly war.”\nMost intrigu­ing­ly, there was also “a scroll made entire­ly of cop­per that lists the loca­tions of lost trea­sure.” None of it has ever been found, much as the con­tent of the oth­er texts has­n’t forced a great rethink­ing of the reli­gion at the cen­ter of so much of West­ern civ­i­liza­tion. In fact, as Bib­li­cal schol­ar Robert Alter writes in the Lon­don Review of Books, “the notion that these sec­tar­i­an writ­ings are actu­al­ly Chris­t­ian has no schol­ar­ly cred­i­bil­i­ty,” though some researchers argue that “the blue­print for the Gospel nar­ra­tives,” mes­si­ah fig­ure and all, “was laid out in the Scrolls and fol­lowed by the first Chris­t­ian writ­ers.” They do, how­ev­er, reveal a great deal about the world­view of the par­tic­u­lar fringe faith­ful who took to the desert to keep their unortho­dox beliefs safe from the harsh judg­ment of main­stream soci­ety — and, for about twen­ty cen­turies, safe they remained.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nGoogle Puts The Dead Sea Scrolls Online (in Super High Res­o­lu­tion)\nGoogle Dig­i­tizes Ancient Copies of the Ten Com­mand­ments and Gen­e­sis\n2,000-Year-Old Man­u­script of the Ten Com­mand­ments Gets Dig­i­tized: See/Download “Nash Papyrus” in High Res­o­lu­tion\nHow Ancient Scrolls, Charred by the Erup­tion of Mount Vesu­vius in 79 AD, Are Now Being Read by Par­ti­cle Accel­er­a­tors, 3D Mod­el­ing & Arti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence\nThe Gnos­tic Gospels: An Intro­duc­tion to the For­bid­den Teach­ings of Jesus\nIntro­duc­tion to the Old Tes­ta­ment: A Free Yale Course\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

The Colombia-based designer and illustrator recently released a pair of hand-drawn digital landscapes that take a bird’s-eye view of Yosemite National Park. Starting with a wide aerial shot of coniferous trees, the films then journey down a stream up to a waterfall, capturing the majestic scenery with grainy, tactile detail.\nThe project is a commission for Yosemite, a venture capital firm helmed by Reed Jobs that funds startups and researchers working on cancer treatments. For the creative direction, Cravents collaborated with LoveFrom, a collective helmed by Apple alum Jony Ive.\n\n\n\nWinter and autumn are available for viewing, but the spring and summer films have yet to be released.

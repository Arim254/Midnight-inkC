    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tFebruary 24th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn ancient Egypt, writ­ing hiero­glyphs was a high­ly spe­cial­ized skill, one com­mand­ed by only a small frac­tion of the pop­u­la­tion. The fact that there were more than 1,000 char­ac­ters to mem­o­rize prob­a­bly had some­thing to do with that, but the vari­ety of sur­faces on which hiero­glyphs were writ­ten could­n’t have made it any eas­i­er. Depend­ing on the occa­sion, ancient Egyp­tians used papyrus, wood, met­al, and pot­tery shards as writ­ing sur­faces. The most mon­u­men­tal or reli­gious­ly impor­tant texts, how­ev­er, got carved into stone, thus ensur­ing the words a kind of eter­nal life — a par­tic­u­lar con­cern in the cas­es of tomb walls and sar­copha­gi.\nThere may be lit­tle call to write hiero­glyphs today, but the tech­niques to do so haven’t been lost. In the new video above from the Vic­to­ria and Albert Muse­um, sculp­tor and stone carv­er Miri­am John­son demon­strates how to carve into stone the name of Pharaoh Khu­fu, who built the Great Pyra­mid (and indeed, was buried in it).\nThe first step is to write that name, sur­round­ed by its car­touche, on a sheet of car­bon paper. This isn’t the brush and ink that the ancient Egyp­tians would have used, grant­ed, but for the rest of the project, John­son sticks to the old-fash­ioned ways. With the image trans­ferred, and using noth­ing more than a mal­let and a chis­el, she carves the hiero­glyphs into the stone not just once but twice.\nThe first time, John­son carves in “sunken relief,” a tech­nique that involves cut­ting the image out of the sur­face of the stone. The sec­ond time, she ren­ders Pharaoh Khu­fu’s name in “raised relief,” which requires cut­ting out every­thing but the image, cre­at­ing the effect of the hiero­glyphs ris­ing out of the stone. With the for­mer “you see more of the shad­ows”; with the lat­ter, “you’ve got more oppor­tu­ni­ty of putting more tex­ture into the char­ac­ters.” Seen in a state of com­ple­tion — by a lay­man, at least — John­son’s carv­ings would­n’t look out of place in a muse­um exhib­it on ancient Egypt. Even if tools man­u­fac­tured in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry pro­duce a few sub­tle dif­fer­ences from the real thing, give these stones a mil­len­ni­um or two to age, and they’ll sure­ly look even more con­vinc­ing.\nvia Kot­tke\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow to Read Ancient Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs: A British Muse­um Cura­tor Explains\nAn Ani­mat­ed Intro­duc­tion to the Roset­ta Stone, and How It Unlocked Our Under­stand­ing of Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs\nWhat Ancient Egypt­ian Sound­ed Like & How We Know It\n3,200-Year-Old Egypt­ian Tablet Records Excus­es for Why Peo­ple Missed Work: “The Scor­pi­on Bit Him,” “Brew­ing Beer” & More\nYou Could Soon Be Able to Text with 2,000 Ancient Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs\nWatch a Mas­ter­piece Emerge from a Sol­id Block of Stone\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tFebruary 25th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe Silk Road’s long peri­od of high activ­i­ty spanned the sec­ond cen­tu­ry BC and the fif­teenth cen­tu­ry AD, but its name was­n’t coined until more than 400 years after that. Schol­ars have argued it prac­ti­cal­ly ever since, giv­en that the ref­er­ent was­n’t just one road but a vast and ever-chang­ing net­work of them, and that silk was hard­ly the only com­mod­i­ty car­ried by its traders. Yet the name per­sists, and not only due to Mar­co Polo-type roman­ti­cism. Silk may not have been the high­est-vol­ume item on its epony­mous road — more busi­ness was sure­ly done in every­day tex­tiles, to say noth­ing of spices, grains, or dyes — but it was per­haps the most vis­i­ble, and sure­ly the most glam­orous. From the per­spec­tive of Chi­nese civ­i­liza­tion, it can also look like the most impor­tant.\nIn the new Pri­mal Space video above, you can hear the sto­ry of “the machine that made Chi­na rich”: the pat­tern loom, that is, a mod­el of which was unearthed in 2017 dur­ing sub­way con­struc­tion in the city of Cheng­du. At some­where between 2,100 and 2,200 years old, they rep­re­sent the ear­li­est known evi­dence of pat­tern loom tech­nol­o­gy, of which Chi­na made high­ly pro­duc­tive use dur­ing the time of its three-mil­len­ni­um monop­oly on silk.\nAs far away as the Roman Empire, those who had the means could­n’t get enough of the stuff, espe­cial­ly when it came in designs nev­er before seen in human his­to­ry. Hence the high pri­or­i­ty Chi­na placed on keep­ing knowl­edge of its har­vest­ing and weav­ing pro­pri­etary — at least until a cou­ple of Roman monks man­aged to smug­gle silk­worm lar­vae back to Europe in the mid­dle of the sixth cen­tu­ry.\nYet even hav­ing lost its sta­tus as the only land capa­ble of pro­duc­ing silk, Chi­na retained a great advan­tage in the form of its sheer man­u­fac­tur­ing capac­i­ty. (This sto­ry rings some­what famil­iar about a mil­len­ni­um and a half lat­er, when none of us can dis­pute which coun­try holds the title of “the world’s fac­to­ry.”) Its silk indus­try could achieve that scale thanks to the rel­a­tive ease of use of the pat­tern loom, which required no spe­cial skills to oper­ate. The most com­plex aspect would have been “pro­gram­ming” the pat­terns to be formed by the strands, which, though an entire­ly ana­log process, has its basic sim­i­lar­i­ties with the dig­i­tal com­put­er pro­gram­ming we know today. Chi­na’s trade net­works have great­ly mul­ti­plied since the days of Mar­co Polo, and the tech­nol­o­gy it uses has devel­oped to a pre­vi­ous­ly unimag­in­able degree. Yet some­how, the “Elec­tric Vehi­cle Road” does­n’t have quite the same ring, does it?\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nDis­cov­er the World’s First Earth­quake Detec­tor, Invent­ed in Chi­na 2,000 Years Ago\nHow the Ornate Tapes­tries from the Age of Louis XIV Were Made (and Are Still Made Today)\nChina’s 8,000 Ter­ra­cot­ta War­riors: An Ani­mat­ed & Inter­ac­tive Intro­duc­tion to a Great Archae­o­log­i­cal Dis­cov­ery\nWatch a Trans­fix­ing Demon­stra­tion of Kumi­hi­mo, the Ancient Japan­ese Art­form of Mak­ing Braids & Cords\nThe Improb­a­ble Inven­tion of Chi­nese Type­writ­ers & Com­put­er Key­boards: Three Videos Tell the Tech­no-Cul­tur­al Sto­ry\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWe seem to be liv­ing through yet anoth­er major moment for pod­cast­ing. Over the past two decades, the medi­um has gone from niche exper­i­ment to main­stream habit, becom­ing a reg­u­lar part of how we learn, enter­tain our­selves, and pass the time. The pop­u­lar­i­ty of podcasts—in an age of ubiq­ui­tous screens and per­pet­u­al distractions—speaks to some­thing deep with­in us. Oral sto­ry­telling, as old as human speech, nev­er real­ly dis­ap­pears. The medi­um evolves, plat­forms shift, dis­tri­b­u­tion changes—but the basic appeal remains con­stant.\nBut the dif­fer­ences between this gold­en age of pod­cast­ing and the gold­en age of radio are still sig­nif­i­cant. Where the pod­cast is often off-the-cuff, and often very inti­mate and personal—sometimes seen as “too personal”—radio pro­grams were almost always care­ful­ly script­ed and fea­tured pro­fes­sion­al tal­ent. Even those pro­grams with man-on-the street fea­tures or inter­views with ordi­nary folks were care­ful­ly orches­trat­ed and medi­at­ed by pro­duc­ers, actors, and pre­sen­ters. And the busi­ness of scor­ing music and sound effects for radio pro­grams was a very seri­ous one indeed. All of these formalities—in addi­tion to the lim­it­ed fre­quen­cy range of old ana­log record­ing technology—contribute to what we imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­nize as the sound of “old time radio.” It is a quaint sound, but also one with a cer­tain grav­i­tas, an echo of a bygone age.\nThat gold­en age waned as tele­vi­sion came into its own in the mid-fifties, but near its end, some broad­cast com­pa­nies made every effort to put togeth­er the high­est qual­i­ty radio pro­gram­ming they could in order to retain their audi­ence. One such pro­gram, the CBS Radio Work­shop, which ran from Jan­u­ary, 1956 to Sep­tem­ber, 1957, may have been “too lit­tle too late”—as radio preser­va­tion­ist site Dig­i­tal Deli writes—but it nonethe­less was “every bit as inno­v­a­tive and cut­ting edge” as the pro­grams that came before it.\n\nThe first two episodes, right below, were drama­ti­za­tions of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, read by the author him­self. The series’ remain­ing 84 pro­grams drew from the work of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, James Thurber, H.L. Menck­en, Mark Twain, Robert Hein­lein, Eugene O’Neill, Balzac, Carl Sand­burg, and so many more. It also fea­tured orig­i­nal com­e­dy, dra­ma, music, and This Amer­i­can Life-style pro­files and sto­ry­telling.\n\n\n\t\n\nHux­ley returned in pro­gram #12, with a sto­ry called “Jacob’s Hands,” writ­ten in col­lab­o­ra­tion with and read by Christo­pher Ish­er­wood. The great Ray Brad­bury made an appear­ance, in pro­gram #4, intro­duc­ing his sto­ries “Sea­son of Dis­be­lief” and “Hail and Farewell,” read by John Dehn­er and Sta­cy Har­ris, and scored by future film and TV com­pos­er Jer­ry Gold­smith. Oth­er pro­grams, like #10, “The Exur­ban­ites,” nar­rat­ed by famous war cor­re­spon­dent Eric Sevareid, con­duct­ed prob­ing inves­ti­ga­tions of mod­ern life—in this case the growth of sub­ur­bia and its rela­tion­ship to the adver­tis­ing indus­try. The above is but a tiny sam­pling of the wealth of qual­i­ty pro­gram­ming the CBS Radio Work­shop pro­duced, and you can hear all of it—all 86 episodes—courtesy of the Inter­net Archive.\n\nSam­ple stream­ing episodes in the play­er above, or down­load indi­vid­ual pro­grams as MP3s and enjoy them at your leisure, almost like, well, a pod­cast. See Dig­i­tal Deli for a com­plete run­down of each program’s con­tent and cast, as well as an exten­sive his­to­ry of the series. This is the swan song of gold­en age radio, which, it seems, maybe nev­er real­ly left, giv­en the incred­i­ble num­ber of lis­ten­ing expe­ri­ences we still have at our dis­pos­al. Yes, some­day our pod­casts will sound quaint and curi­ous to the ears of more advanced lis­ten­ers, but even then, I’d bet, peo­ple will still be telling and record­ing sto­ries, and the sound of human voic­es will con­tin­ue to cap­ti­vate us as it always has.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHear 230 Episodes of Escape: Clas­sic Radio Dra­mas of Sto­ries by Ray Brad­bury, Edgar Allan Poe, H.G.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDubbed the “vine that ate the South,” the infamous kudzu plant has a reputation. The fast-multiplying, invasive arrowroot was brought to North America in the 19th century and promoted to ease erosion, although the hot, muggy climate of the Southern U.S. proved too accommodating. For decades, kudzu has spread at a rapid speed, swallowing up roadsides, infrastructure, and really anything in its path. Its seemingly insatiable growth has vaulted the perennial plant to mythic status in Southern ecology, conservation, and culture.\nAs a child in Birmingham, Joyce Lin was accustomed to the vine, although as an adult, she’s found that it’s difficult to disentangle kudzu’s reputation and tangible influence. “It is loathed for shading out the native flora, but its impact is often overstated,” she says. “While it visibly thrives along roadsides where there is a lot of sun, kudzu is unable to penetrate deeply into forests.”\n“Kudzu Chair” (2025), wood, kudzu vine, epoxy, cloth, wire, and paint\nThis complicated legacy inspired a body of work that melds vernacular furniture with the plant. Kudzu Series comprises four sculptures that wouldn’t be out of place on an abandoned Southern farm. A found metal floorlamp cracks in two, wrapping the leafy plant around a bulb like a lopsided shade. The vines also climb up a wooden ladder, their sinuous roots mimicking the steps of the lower rungs.\nLin is interested in the relationship between reality and fantasy, particularly as she transforms synthetic materials into uncanny knotted bark and concentric growth rings in the shape of a chair. Kudzu Series is no different. While she foraged the thick vines from areas near her home in Houston, the artificial leaves emerged from a laborious process. \nCiting the techniques of Michael Anderson, who made models for Yale’s Peabody Museum before retiring, Lin made plaster and silicone press molds. “My method uses wires sandwiched between dyed shop towels and tissue paper soaked in five-minute epoxy. I painstakingly painted in the veins and details on each leaf. Imperfections of the casts ultimately turned into brown spots and bug holes,” she says. Creating seamless transitions from wood to vine with epoxy clay and utilizing inner armatures adds to the surreal qualities of the works, as the plant appears to sprout directly from the industrial material. Torching, vinegar, and steel wool weathered areas that were too pristine. \nPerched on a few leaves are a handful of kudzu bugs, rotund insects that arrived in the U.S. in the aughts and have decimated the vines. “The chair has approximately 332 leaves and one bug, the table has 101 leaves and three bugs, the floor lamp has 162 leaves and two bugs, and the ladder has 117 leaves and one bug, which in total took me a little over a year to make,” the artist says.\nDetail of “Kudzu Chair” (2025).

She adds: \n\nIt arrived as an outsider, yet it has become an icon of the South, appearing in art, music, and literature. It outcompetes species, yet its flexibility and resilience make it uniquely suited to survive a changing climate. Its roots are edible, its vines are weavable, its fibers can be used to make cloth and paper, and it has been used in East Asian medicine for centuries. \n\nLin is currently teaching at the Rhode Island School of Design and will spend the summer in Philadelphia for the Windgate Arts Residency Program.

The Danish artist is known for layering, crimping, and twisting paper into lush bouquets at a scale so large that the blooms often cloak entire walls and fill rooms with vibrant color. While she’s spent 14 years carefully sculpting these botanical sculptures, Scott-Hansen has been simultaneously at work creating self-portraits through the same techniques.\nSporting braided horns or framed with spiraling tendrils, almost like a lion’s mane, these expressive masks are in part diaristic as they capture a particular moment in life and translate feelings the artist might not otherwise express. “A bit like Giuseppe Arcimboldo, I combined elements like flowers and other floral details (some of which even resemble insects) and paired these into facial features matching how I felt inside,” she says.\nScott-Hansen is represented by The Spaceless Gallery, and you can find more of her work on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

A remark­able col­lec­tion of this often reviled but end­less­ly fas­ci­nat­ing area of the Eng­lish lan­guage, it cov­ers slang from the past five cen­turies right up to the present day, from all the dif­fer­ent Eng­lish-speak­ing coun­tries and regions. Total­ing 10.3 mil­lion words and over 53,000 entries, the col­lec­tion pro­vides the def­i­n­i­tions of 100,000 words and over 413,000 cita­tions. Every word and phrase is authen­ti­cat­ed by gen­uine and ful­ly-ref­er­enced cita­tions of its use, giv­ing the work a lev­el of author­i­ty and schol­ar­ship unmatched by any oth­er pub­li­ca­tion in this field.”\nIf you head over to Ama­zon, that’s how you will find Green’s Dic­tio­nary of Slang pitched to con­sumers. The dic­tio­nary is an attrac­tive three-vol­ume, hard-bound set. But it comes at a price. $1,327.78.\nNow comes the good news. Green’s Dic­tio­nary of Slang has become avail­able as a free web­site, giv­ing you access to an even more updat­ed ver­sion of the dic­tio­nary. Col­lec­tive­ly, the web­site lets you trace the devel­op­ment of slang over the past 500 years. And, as Men­tal Floss notes, the site “allows lookups of word def­i­n­i­tions and ety­molo­gies for free, and, for a well-worth-it sub­scrip­tion fee, it offers cita­tions and more exten­sive search options.” If you’ve ever won­dered about the mean­ing of words like kid­ly­wink, gol­lier, and lint­head, you now know where to begin.\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nA parrot confined to a too-small cage, jellyfish floating above fungi and ferns, and a spotted octopus resting as the centerpiece to a flourishing bouquet are a few of the surreal scenes in the works of Martin Wittfooth. The artist is known for his enigmatic paintings that meld flora and fauna to consider interconnection and nature’s endurance.\nWittfooth currently splits his time between Savannah and Brockville, although he plans to relocate permanently to the latter this year. Before he begins preparing for a solo exhibition in spring 2027 with Hashimoto Contemporary, the artist is completing a few larger commissions. \n“Dam”\nHe enjoys the balance between larger bodies of work and singular pieces: “A unified field of concepts and vibes, to have all of the pieces in an exhibition have a kind of kindred dialogue going on between one another, and then when the dust settles in between shows, to have singular works to focus on, where I can slow down just a bit and let the new ideas start to form for the next show,” he says.\nAlong with Yuko Shimizu, Wittfooth will also mentor at the unique Quarantine residency this April. This is his third time participating in the program, and it’s one that informs much of the way he thinks about connection. He’s always impressed by “how quickly bonds form between the students, between the mentors, between the students and the mentors, and with the whole crew that runs the show,” he says, adding: \n\nThere’s been a lot of emphasis on this notion that community is important—as a species, we’ve appreciated this in our various ways for as long as we’ve been around—but for artists, this is often a bit of a struggle to develop and to maintain, considering the isolating nature of how we work. It’s also something that seems to have become more broadly murky and confused in this era of social media, with person-to-person contact being replaced by virtual interactions and projection of virtual selves—methods of communication that I personally feel are missing the essential ingredient of connection.\n\nYou can find more about the program on Colossal, and explore Wittfooth’s work on his website and Instagram.\n“Parallelism Jellyfish 2”\n“The Alchemist”\n“Parallelism Paradise”\n“Liberty”\n“Parallelism 9”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCompleted in 1972, the innovative 48-story building known as the Transamerica Pyramid Center quickly became an indelible icon of the San Francisco skyline. Its modernist features include blocky elements, uniform rows of windows, and it’s namesake pyramidical shape, but its design also took its surroundings into consideration, as its tapered shape meant that more sunlight could reach the ground level around it.\nInside, the light-filled Annex Gallery is currently home to the similarly towering works of Tara Donovan’s Stratagems series. Made from thousands of recycled CDs that are wrapped around steel supports and placed on concrete plinths, these swirling, reflective spires directly reference skyscraper architecture. “I am always fixated on the ways that sculptures transform space and experience, and in this context, an intention of these sculptures to engage the understanding of urban architecture can be fully realized,” Donovan says.\n\nDonovan is known for her large-scale sculptures that assume architectonic or geologic forms using huge quantities of everyday materials such as buttons, plastic cups, straws, or tar paper. Assembled or stacked into freestanding sculptures and broad installations covering entire walls or floors, she transforms uniform, mundane items into ethereal interactions of light, texture, scale, and space.\nDonovan’s Stratgems pieces are also an elegant examination of the evolution of technology. CDs emerged as a dominant commercial medium for music in the 1990s but were eventually usurped by digital formats like the MP3, then streaming services. Placed within the context of the modernist Transamerica Pyramid Center—an iconic structure that is nevertheless a product of the past—we’re prompted to consider how our attitudes and values evolve over time.\nThe skyscraper is positioned as a collaborator in Donovan’s exhibition, which is presented by the Institute of Contemporary Art San Francisco (ICA SF). The show marks an initiative by the museum to nomadically exhibit in different places in order to increase access, situate pieces in unique contexts, and bring artists directly into dialogue with the city.\nStratagems remains on view through July 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The show was co-curated by Eve Straussman-Pflanzer, who has since become the curator and head of Italian and Spanish Paintings at the NGA. Gentilischi created this work at the apex of her career upon her return to Rome. In an email to Hyperallergic, Straussman-Pflanzer stated that the artist's “strongest, and arguably most important” paintings were made in the early 1620s.“In this period, Artemisia Gentileschi offers the viewer her most confident pictures, including our newly acquired ‘Mary Magdalene,’ where the figures, male or female, are fully realized, sentient human beings,” she said.  The composition evokes Caravaggio's earlier rendition — stripped of the skull, cross, and ointment jar that usually accompanied the disciple in favor of depicting her cave-dwelling life in solitude after the ascension of Christ. Against the sparse backdrop of a dark cavern, Mary Magdalene is reclining with her eyes closed, her head tilted back to expose her neck. Gentileschi imbues the work's spiritual context with a sensual essence by showing Mary's unbound hair, exposed shoulder, and the crease between her underarm and breast. In her state of divine ecstasy, Mary Magdalene appears totally ignorant of the spectator, in spite of the forced proximity employed by the framing. \"Judith Slaying Holofernes\" (1620) by Artemisia Gentileschi (public domain via Wikimedia Commons)Gentileschi frequently interacted with viewers through her figurative subjects and self-portraits, often commanding authority through direct gaze, life-size scale, and confrontational depictions of biblical heroines. A celebrated artist throughout her life and long afterwards, Gentileschi is best known for combining feminine assertion and vulnerability through dramatic works such as “Judith Beheading Holofernes” (c. 1620) and “Susanna and the Elders” (1610). In the work recently acquired by the NGA, however, Mary Magdalene's fidelity and spiritual euphoria don't necessarily separate her from the viewer. “We feel and experience this conversion/change along with her,” Straussman-Pflanzer said.Acknowledging the significance of the acquisition, the curator emphasized the importance of conveying to the public that “women artists in the 17th-century were extremely accomplished.”“They were able to capture the power of human emotion and human experience — in this case religious conversion — and transmit it in a vivid and powerfully evocative picture that captures the complexity of human experience, especially that of a woman undergoing a profound emotional and mental change,” she continued. “This is Artemisia Gentileschi's gift,” Straussman-Pflanzer said.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        National Gallery of Art\n                      \n                      \n                        Artemisia Gentileschi\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

(all screenshots via Department of Justice)In a document containing photographs sent to Jeffrey Epstein’s personal email address, the Department of Justice (DOJ) made a curious redaction, placing a black square on the face of one of the most ubiquitous portraits in the world. While the DOJ faces intense scrutiny for releasing sensitive information about Epstein's victims, including social security numbers and uncensored nude photos, in its recent document release, the federal agency decided to cover the face of what appears to be a reproduction of Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.”The altered “Mona Lisa” appears in a document containing photographs emailed to Epstein in 2009, with the subject line “simply paris.” Several photos in the email portray a young couple, including a woman whose face is redacted and an unnamed man. Photos in the email show the young couple at famous tourist destinations in Paris, including the Arc de Triomphe and inside the Louvre Museum.Redacted photos in a July 2009 email to Epstein titled \"simply paris\"The redacted image of Mona Lisa appears to be a reproduction of the artwork, not the actual painting, though in another photograph in the email, an individual can be seen walking past the glass-covered painting hanging in the Louvre. “We just walked around all over the city not just the sight seeing [sic]... we took like 1500 pictures so was really difficult to decide wich [sic] to send!” the email, sent by a redacted contact, said.The email is dated July 3, 2009, weeks before Epstein was released from jail following his Florida conviction for charges including soliciting prostitution from a minor. The redaction of the Mona Lisa feels particularly misguided as the DOJ faces accusations of releasing identifying information about about 100 Epstein survivors in their latest release of documents related to the convicted child sex offender. One lawyer for a survivor claimed his client was named over 500 times in the files. According to the New York Times, 40 images contained unredacted nude photos and the faces of seven individuals. After the publication notified the DOJ, a spokesperson said it was in the process of making proper redactions. The most recent tranche of Epstein files has also revealed new connections between the disgraced financier and art world figures. David A. Ross, the former chair of the School of Visual Arts MFA Art Practice Department, resigned from his post following the release of his email exchanges with Epstein. Emails also showed that Jeff Koons attended a dinner at Epstein's home years after his conviction.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Jeffrey Epstein\n                      \n                  \n        ",

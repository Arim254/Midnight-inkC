    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne of the top comments on a new video from the Victoria and Albert Museum reads as follows: “I think it is time to have a renaissance of mourning. In this age of sanitized and hidden grief, it would be a welcomed relief for a more refined mourning experience.”\nThis commenter is responding to two V&A curators unboxing a collection of 19th-century objects common in Victorian mourning traditions. Through a variety of garments, ephemera, and photos, the pair showcases the elaborate rituals and rites people once used to honor the dead.\n\n\n\nThe video highlights a black, silk gown with tiny pleats, delicate lace, and sequins, along with jewelry made from semi-precious jet stones, and brooches containing human hair. The curators also present several printed artifacts, like mourning cards and portraits of the dying.\nWhat becomes clear throughout the video is how much our contemporary culture of grief and loss has turned inward and is something managed privately rather than shared with a community. “Mourning objects can be personal, portable, ostentatious, sentimental, or even a little bit grizzly,” the curators add. “Is it too much? Or do you think we should mourn the passing of these poignant and fascinating trappings of grief?”\nFind the unboxing on YouTube, along with several additional adventures in the museum’s collections.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

When letters were found etched on the surface of Oldenburg's “Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks” (1969) last month, the university announced that after 50 years in the Morse College courtyard, the public work would be moved to the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) for “conservation and care,” the Yale Daily News reported.In an email to Hyperallergic, YUAG spokesperson Roland Coffey confirmed that the piece was deinstalled this week and said that “following additional offsite conservation, the sculpture will be displayed in the Gallery’s outdoor sculpture garden in March 2026.” Late artist and Yale alumnus Claes Oldenburg's “Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks” (1969) at the Morse College courtyard on campus (photo courtesy Yale University Art Gallery)Oldenburg, who graduated from Yale in 1950, created the 24-foot steel sculpture in collaboration with a group of the university's architecture students as a surprise gift to the school in 1969 — the same year the school began accepting women to study. It was originally installed with an inflatable lipstick crayon at the university's Beinecke Plaza to serve as a speaking platform during a series of anti-Vietnam War protests, but after severe vandalism, Oldenburg and the students removed and refabricated it for durability before giving it back to Yale. The school shifted the work's ownership to YUAG and re-installed it at the Morse College courtyard in 1974, where it became the campus residential community's emblem for the last half-century. Per an update from Yale Daily News, University President Maurie McInnis clarified that the Lipstick sculpture will be moved to the “back courtyard of YUAG,” to keep it safe from sun damage and vandalism. A minute memorial for a monumental loss (photo by and courtesy Alexa Martindale)While the Morse College community mourns the beloved Lipstick sculpture, Architecture alumni Stuart Wrede and Sam Callaway, who were part of the group that commissioned Oldenburg for the project, have long argued that the sculpture was designed specifically as a public protest work for Beinecke Plaza, and it should be returned there. “I’m sorry, but I find this hilarious as a reason,” Wrede told the college newspaper in response to McInnis citing sun protection among the reasons to move the work. The Lipstick sculpture was selected for a funded restoration over the summer through the Bank of America Art Conservation Project, during which it had been repainted and recoated after years of environmental exposure. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Claes Oldenburg\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

As part of a three-year investigation that will inform upcoming restoration work, archaeologists discovered 60 flint flakes they believe were used as tools around 4,300 BCE during the Mesolithic or early Neolithic period. The archaeologists also uncovered additional items, including 800-year-old footwear and a 19th-century beer jug. The group noted that the flint artifacts predate Stonehenge's earliest earthworks by 1,000 years. At Stonehenge, flint tools are believed to have been used to chip and shape stone. The flint artifacts, said the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority in a press release, originated from the now-gone Thorney Island, formed by the once intersecting Thames and River Tyburn. Prehistoric people, archaeologists said, used that island stretch for fishing, hunting, and food gathering. The objects were discovered in the Cromwell Green section of the property.Flint artifacts believed to be 6,000 years old (image courtesy Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority)The discovery comes as parliament weighs costly options for the much-needed restoration of the building. Parliament was expected to vote on a final plan for the restoration of the palace later this year, but the process appears to be delayed again as members contend with a multibillion-pound price tag on the renewal. Proponents for urgent restoration caution against increasing fire risk to the building as it ages. Over the last decade, there were a reported 44 fires in the building. Judith Cummins MP, Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority board chair, said in a statement that the discovery came as part of inquiries into the building's history as it prepares for a major renovation \"to understand more about the building and the thousands of years of history underneath the home of Parliament.\" Nine areas of the Westminster campus are subject to the investigations, including the Royal Court, Speaker’s Court, and the Thames River shoreline. The discovery comes ahead of an expected restoration of the historic palace.\"It is vital we continue these investigations to understand what lies beneath the ground here at an early stage to inform and guide decisions on design and further surveys ahead of future enabling and construction works,\" Diane Abrams, the lead archaeologist for the investigations, said in a statement. \"This ensures the site’s extraordinary heritage and archaeology is managed appropriately while enabling the safe and efficient delivery of the Restoration and Renewal Programme.”Earlier this year, archaeologists at the site uncovered part of a medieval two-story hall from 1167, believed to have burnt completely in the 19th century, which once served as a dining area and as the Court of Chancery, the Court of Requests, and for parliamentary functions. In a statement, the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority said this previous discovery had been the most important of the group's work to date.The investigations will carry on through 2026, and a final report on the group's findings will be released in 2027.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n    \n                News\n                Proponents of a new measure say royalties will allow visual artists to benefit from their career growth over time.\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Kenojuak Ashevak's \"The Enchanted Owl\" (1960) (image courtesy Dorset Fine Arts)\n    \n        \n            Visual artists in Canada may soon receive royalties from the resale of their works after the government announced its intent to amend its copyright laws last month.In Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first budget bill, passed narrowly on November 17, the government said it intended to establish an “Artist’s Resale Right,” a directive that would entitle artists to royalties from secondary and future sales of their artworks. One clause of the bill states that the measure would help create secondary income streams for visual artists, who are among Canada’s lowest earners and, like artists in the United States, currently do not receive royalties if their work's value increases after its initial sale.Proponents of the measure say royalties will allow artists to benefit from their career growth over time, and that it will particularly benefit Indigenous artists whose work is “commonly exploited on the secondary market,” according to the nonprofit Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des artistes canadiens (CARFAC). A similar bid for royalties failed in Canada in 2022. Artist's Resale Right (ARR) is commonly recognized by countries in the European Union, entitling artists to a cut of each subsequent sale of their artworks. In France, for example, artists can pocket 3% an art sale of between €50,000 €200,000 ($58,189.50 and $232,758). In the United Kingdom, a work must sell for at least £1,000, and royalties are capped at £12,500 (~$1,332.51 and ~$16,657.34, respectively). The UK law applies to artists during their lifetime and for the 70 years following their death. The United States does not currently recognize a federal Artist’s Resale Right, and a California law implementing up to 5% in royalties for artists was struck down in 2018 after a federal judge ruled that federal copyright laws prevented the measure. The Canadian government has not announced specific royalties yet, nor a timeline for the implementation of an Artist’s Resale Right. A spokesperson for the Department of Canadian Heritage told Hyperallergic that amendments to the country's copyright laws will be brought forth “at the earliest possible opportunity, with details to be made public when the bill is tabled.” The spokesperson added that the government expects the budget bill to support Indigenous artists, who make up 4.1% of visual artists in the country and are most highly represented in the visual arts, as compared to other creative disciplines.April Britski, CARFAC's national executive director, believes that artists in Canada could receive between CA$3 and CA$5 million in total royalties annually (~$2.13 and $3.55 million) under an official Artist's Resale Right. The organization has issued a proposal recommending that the government implement 5% royalties on all works selling for at least CA$1,000 (~$721.07). “[The Artist's Resale Right] is particularly beneficial for Indigenous and senior artists, and it is a critical step forward in improving the economic conditions of Canadian artists,” Britski told Hyperallergic in an email.CARFAC’s website cites late Inuk artist Kenojuak Ashevak’s sale of editions of her stonecut print “Enchanted Owl” (1960) in support of an Artist's Resale Right. An edition was later resold for CA$216,000 (~$156,131.50) in 2018, and one is now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Neither Ashevak nor her estate received any of the profits from the resale of her work.“There can often be a huge markup on secondary sales of their work, so ARR is an important opportunity for economic reconciliation,” Britski continued.A second budget bill with further details about the copyright amendments and resale right is expected to reach the House of Commons later in the winter, according to Britski.“We're not quite there, but it is coming, and Canadian artists will soon be able to share in the profits made on their work in the secondary market,” Britski said. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Canada\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMIAMI BEACH — For the third year in a row, a coalition of Miami artists and activists met at City Hall near the Miami Beach Convention Center today, December 6, on the busy Saturday of Art Basel to raise their voices and handmade signs in protest of the event’s ties to the genocide in Gaza. This time, the advocacy group Artists 4 Artists also joined the action to call for a boycott of the next edition of the fair in 2026, citing the event's impact on both the environment and the local arts community. After being relocated from the front of the Convention Center last year by dozens of Miami Beach police officers, several of the organizers are involved in ongoing litigation with the city of Miami Beach over what they allege are violations of their free speech. Chanting from the grass in front of City Hall within view of the fair entrance, dozens of protestors spoke with passing fairgoers peacefully about Israel’s ongoing violence in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank despite a ceasefire.The action brought together members of Artists 4 Artists and Jewish Voice for Peace. (photo courtesy A4A:MIA)Watched by a police sniper on a nearby rooftop and three rented vans with screens on them that accused South Florida Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP) leaders of being antisemitic, organizers raised the “LET PALESTINE LIVE” banner that was sewn for Art Week in December 2023. They handed out leaflets that included QR codes linking to poetry and visual art by Mahmoud Darwish, Hazem Harb, and other Palestinian writers and artists. A spokesperson for Art Basel told Hyperallergic that the fair was “in close coordination with the City of Miami Beach and the Miami Beach Police Department to ensure that demonstrators were able to gather in the public area outside the venue, and that visitors could access the fair safely and without disruption.”Attendees flagged the presence of police and a sniper on a nearby rooftop.

In an interview with Hyperallergic, Rischmawi pointed to the importance of de-centering this week and Art Basel in the close-knit Miami art scene. “It’s strange seeing our people on those trucks being vilified, because they are scared of us and we’re just coming from a place of love and commitment and trying to build bridges in our community,” Rischmawi said. “I think even just people seeing how we are happy and all together and in true community outside of a money-centered event like this is valuable.”Rischmawi is organizing an exhibition at the Boom Box in Miami next week called Beyond Home, which will use the form of a tent to consider displacement in both a Floridian and international context and feature Palestinian and immigrant artists. Dozens gathered near City Hall in Miami Beach.

Miami-Dade County has also invested a reported $151 million in Israeli bonds. Meanwhile, Miami Artists 4 Artists organizers misael soto and johann c. muñoz-tapasco urged people to boycott Art Basel and its associated events next year.“These fairs come here and extract the labor of gig workers, extract the cultural nuances and energies that the city has to offer, and turn that into a profit that none of us see,” muñoz-tapasco explained, pointing to the intersectionality of Palestine with the larger rise of fascism and censorship in Florida under the Republican-led government. Police presence at the protest (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)“These institutions want our art, but they don’t want the people who make the art. They refuse to do things that will make the world safer for us, and are often complicit in the systems eroding our work,” muñoz-tabasco continued. “We’re not just in late stage capitalism, but in a kind of cognitive capitalism, where our artwork is feeding AI programs, from image to writing,\" they said. “We are in a position of advantage because we have the actual vision, which they want, but we are taught that we have to be a certain way to be anyone in the world of the arts.”The Art Basel spokesperson said the fair “remains deeply committed to the creative community in Greater Miami and to supporting the many Miami Beach– and Miami-based artists who participate in our show through their galleries.” UBS, the spokesperson added, is “Art Basel’s long-standing Global Lead Partner, and our collaboration is focused on supporting artists, galleries, and cultural programming across our shows worldwide.\"Artist Eddie Arroyo holds up his drawing of the police sniper. (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)Miami Artists 4 Artists was one of the organizers of an ongoing artists’ census, as well as an exhibition earlier this year called The Artist as Activist, which protested the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center in the Everglades. Recognizing that this week is an important source of income for South Florida artists and culture workers, they envision the boycott as a call in to locals and visitors, with exhibitions and programming that are artist- instead of industry-centric. As artist Eddie Arroyo sketched the police vans at the edge of the barricade, Jewish Miami resident Amanda Rose pointed to the religious resonance of looking towards the future. “There’s a saying many of us grew up hearing around Passover: ‘Next year in Jerusalem.’ And it was a subtle way of initiating us into Zionism. But there’s something very powerful about that thought, like projecting into the next year,” she shared in an interview with Hyperallergic. “Maybe next year we won’t have to be here. Maybe if we continue to say it, Palestine will be free.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

The Pritzker Prize-winning architect suffered a respiratory illness before his death at his home in Santa Monica, California, his chief of staff told the New York Times.A monumental figure who demystified modern architecture and an early adopter of computer-driven design, Gehry became beloved for his luminescent, curvilinear structures that appeared to defy gravity. His postmodern designs of museums, concert halls, and libraries have become destinations for tourists as much as the venues themselves. His most revered accomplishment is arguably the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in northern Spain, which was immediately hailed as one of the masterpieces of 20th-century architecture when it opened to the public in 1997. Philip Johnson, no postmodernist slouch himself, called the museum design “the greatest building of our time” and proclaimed Gehry as “the greatest architect we have today.”Gehry visited the museum 25 years later and told Time magazine that he loved how vibrant the city around his building had become.“There’s a whole feeling of life that’s different,” he said. “It makes me feel good that we contributed to that.”Museo Guggenheim Bilbao (photo by Naotake Murayama via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)A spokesman for the Solomon Guggenheim Museum and Foundation said the organization was “deeply grateful” for his contributions to the Guggenheim’s landmark museums.“His daring vision and design brilliance reshaped the field of architecture and our contemporary world. Gehry showed us how powerful and transformative museum architecture can be,” the Guggenheim spokesperson said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “Frank will be greatly missed, and we know that his legacy will inspire many generations to come.”Born Frank Owen Goldberg in Toronto, Canada, in 1929, Gehry sometimes worked part-time in his grandfather’s hardware store, exposing him to the everyday materials that made houses and other buildings, while his father held several different jobs that included managing a grocery store and selling manual slot machines.In 1947, his family immigrated to California and he got a job driving a delivery truck while attending Los Angeles City College before enrolling in the University of Southern California’s School of Architecture. He graduated in 1954 and soon moved across the country to study architecture at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design but dropped out of the program, and later began designing furniture out of cardboard and masonite.He returned to Los Angeles in 1957 and began designing his first private residence. Five years later he started his practice, which formally became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967. His innovative designs including the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro and the California Aerospace Museum dotted Southern California in the 1980s. By the end of the decade he had won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, whose jury compared him to Pablo Picasso.“Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes,” the jury wrote. “His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.”The Dancing House in Prague (photo by Danny Alexander Lettkemann via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)An even more esteemed collection of commissions that brought Gehry international acclaim soon followed. Gehry completed the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art in Minneapolis in 1993, the Cinemathèque Française in Paris in 1994, and Dancing House in Prague in 1996, before unveiling his Guggenheim masterpiece. Gehry won the commission for the Walt Disney Concert Hall, one of the most beloved concert venues in the nation, in 1987, and the structure was inaugurated in 2003. By 2011, Gehry reinvigorated Manhattan’s skyline with his design of 8 Spruce Street, a 76-story skyscraper known for its distinctive undulating steel facade that resembled woven fabric.MaryAnne Gilmartin, who worked with the architect to build 8 Spruce when she was an executive at Forest City Ratner, called Gehry “a true original — an artist, an architect, and a fearless visionary who changed the way we experience cities.” “Frank approached every challenge with curiosity, generosity, and an unshakeable belief in the power of design to inspire people’s daily lives,” Gilmartin, founder and CEO of MAG Partners, told Hyperallergic. “He didn’t start with formulas or conventions — he started with emotion. He wanted buildings to move people, to feel alive in the city, and to create moments of unexpected beauty.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObituaries\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank Gehry\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n",

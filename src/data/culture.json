    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor Lydia Ricci, a broken pencil, outdated forms, long-ago paid bills, and tattered bits of fabric are prime materials for her elaborate, small-scale worlds. The artist credits her parents’ obsession with collecting as the beginning of what’s grown into a scrap-centric process. \n“My mother was an immigrant from the Ukraine who could improvise anything when we didn’t have exactly what we needed, which was most of the time. And my Italian father hasn’t ever thrown anything away because one day it might be useful, or some day he might get around to fixing it,” she writes.\nDetail of “It’s What’s Inside” (2025), collected scrap materials, 10 x 38 x 13 centimeters\nToday, Ricci pieces together bits and baubles collected for the past 30 years that many other artists might relegate to the trash. Cardboard, candy wrappers, vintage tumblers, and so much more form uncanny miniatures that she refers to as “observations of what people anticipate, complain about, or muse over. Fleeting, unscripted exchanges—mundane yet deeply human—are a continual source of inspiration.”\nMeticulous and playful, the resulting sculptures retain a messy, raw quality that is itself a collection of the original materials. Rather than mask irregularities and signs of wear, Ricci leaves traces of chaos and disorder that capture an authentic quality of modern life.\nFind much more from the artist on Instagram.\n“It’s What’s Inside” (2025), collected scrap materials, 10 x 38 x 13 centimeters\n“That’s Everything” (2024), collected scrap materials, 30 x 35 x 16 centimeters\n“They Were Just Playing” (2024), vintage red Pizza Hut tumblers and collected scrap materials, 90 x 40 x 40 centimeters\nDetail of “They Were Just Playing” (2024), vintage red Pizza Hut tumblers and collected scrap materials, 90 x 40 x 40 centimeters\nDetail of “They Made It Look So Easy” (2024), collected scrap materials, 22 x 26 x 15 centimeters\n“We Should Have Taken Better Care of It” (2023), collected scrap materials, 8  x 8 x 10 centimeters\n“How Did You Get So Good?” (2024), Ukrainian embroidery and collected scrap materials, 8 x 8 x 21 centimeters\n“Take a Turn” (2025), collected scrap materials, 80 x 46 x 5 centimeters\nDetail of “Take a Turn” (2025), collected scrap materials, 80 x 46 x 5 centimeters\n“I Think We Got Disconnected” (2025), collected scrap materials, 22 x 32 x 20 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t",

My time there reminded me of Indigenous tenacity — the quiet, daily work of Native language and history professors, art teachers, staff, and students who sustain culture from within. Their commitment keeps Indigenous languages, knowledge systems, and creative practices alive for future generations. \nAs Native American people, many of our ancestors survived their own versions of erasure under colonial rule. This Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we are witnessing another chapter of that same violence unfold in Palestine — an all-too-familiar attempt at genocide, streamed to us in real time. At home, the ongoing American colonial project continues to meet resistance, a presence I felt in the classrooms of Diné College. My Diné grandparents were forced to leave their Diné Bizaad-speaking families as young children to attend Christian, English-speaking boarding schools sanctioned by the United States government. Shimásání (my grandmother) always encouraged me to learn Diné Bizaad and Diné history. Our ancestors’ strength laid the road for us, and it’s our responsibility to walk it with that same courage. \nFrom the classrooms of tribal colleges to the galleries of major museums, Indigenous perseverance continues to shape art and culture. Building on generations of resilience, contemporary Native artists are asserting their presence boldly across institutions. Jeffrey Gibson’s (Mississippi Choctaw/Cherokee) bronze animal sculptures currently line The Met’s facade, and his exhibition An Indigenous Present — co-curated with others — features works by 15 Indigenous artists spanning the past century. It’s now on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and will tour nationally. Before she passed earlier this year, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith (Citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nation) curated Indigenous Identities: Here, Now & Always at Rutgers University’s Zimmerli Art Museum, featuring 97 living Indigenous artists. Andrea Carlson’s (Grand Portage Ojibwe and European settler descent) first museum survey, A Constant Sky, opened recently at the Denver Art Museum. Kent Monkman (Fisher River Cree Nation) recently opened his largest solo exhibition, History is Painted by the Victors, at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Dyani White Hawk’s (Sičáŋǧu Lakota) Love Language, a major survey of her work, opens October 18 at the Walker Art Center. It’s an exhilarating moment for Native art, as Indigenous voices shape institutions and audiences on a national and international scale.\nFrom left to right: Sháńdíín Brown, Sarah Biscarra Dilley of Froge Project, Laurent Bergeron, and his partner, artist Kent Monkman (photo courtesy Sháńdíín Brown) \nThis Indigenous Peoples’ Day, I encourage readers to support Native-led, non-profit art organizations like Ma’s House, the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), the Aquinnah Cultural Center, the Tomaquag Museum, Forge Project, the Native Arts + Cultures Foundation (NACF), or your local tribal cultural center, museum, or college. These organizations nurture Native artists, thinkers, and culture bearers. Indigenous art and culture are not only surviving, they’re thriving. But sustaining that future requires support. Acknowledging Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Indigenous survivance is a start, but there’s a critical need to turn recognition into tangible action. The next Jeffrey Gibson might be sitting in a classroom at IAIA right now. IAIA’s federal funding remains unstable, a consequence of budget policies initiated under the Trump administration. This instability underscores a larger truth: after generations of using education to erase Native languages, arts, and knowledge systems, today’s federal support for Indigenous-led tribal colleges — spaces now viewed as “DEI” — isn’t an act of goodwill: it’s a legal and treaty-bound obligation. With all the violence and uncertainty in the world, we need Native-led art and culture spaces. Even $10 helps — the price of an iced coffee in New York City. For readers who may not be able to donate, following these organizations on social media and advocating for their funding is another meaningful way to engage. \nAt the past Santa Fe Indian Market, I volunteered with Forge Project to supply free food and cold drinks to vendors. We handed out 1,000 burritos that day. It was a hopeful moment — one rooted in care, kinship, and action. Like the classrooms at Diné College, it reminded me that Indigenous perseverance lives in both the grand moments and smaller, collective acts of generosity. Being together, learning together, and acting together keep my hope strong. A common phrase in Diné Bizaad is “T’áá hó’ájitéégóó,” which loosely translates to “it’s up to you,” a reminder of our personal agency amid the challenges we inherit and the futures we are building.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSháńdíín Brown is a curator, creative, and citizen of the Navajo Nation from Arizona.

Under the organization’s guidelines, museums can sell works when objects are redundant, damaged, or of “poor quality.”\nAccording to AAM, museum deaccessioning can be an indicator that an institution “has not been adequately supported for many years.”\n\n“Portrait of Emperor Charles V in an Armchair” after the Italian painter Tiziano Vecellio, also known as Titian\nAnother highlighted work in the sale is “Portrait of Emperor Charles V in an Armchair,” a modern copy made after Titian’s work of the same title.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerformance of “bison bison (dance_hum for dirtbath),” written and choreographed by Tanya Lukin Linklater as part of Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea (all photos Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic, unless otherwise noted)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nIn a conversation with Duane Linklater published in the brochure for his current exhibition, 12 + 2, at Dia Chelsea, filmmaker and scholar Tasha Hubbard (Peepeekisis First Nation) distills the intertwined erasures effected under colonialism in North America. Over the course of the 19th century, parallel to the systematic literal and cultural genocide of Native people, settlers killed millions of buffalo, till there remained only a few hundred; even now, when other large game populations are rebounding as part of free-ranging herds, buffalo are for the most part only allowed on private land, national parks, or reservations. “Indigenous people and buffalo are conflated in the settler mind and have been from the beginning; we are buffalo, and they are us,” she said. “And so, just like settler colonialism needs Indigenous people to be constrained and contained, it’s the same for buffalo.” \nLinklater not only lets buffalo run free in 12 + 2, conceptually at least, but in the installation, performance, and paintings on view he also reimagines the world in their terms. Given the mutual identification, coexistence, and interdependence between Native people and the species across millennia, the move is an act of imagining the Earth in and through a lens of Indigeneity. Seven of the beasts, which the artist fashioned out of wire and papier-mâché before scaling them up to two or three times their natural size, make themselves at home in two vast galleries (together they’re titled “wallowposition”). Their faceted planes and visible seams where components connect give them a slightly robot-like appearance. They are eyeless, featureless really, covered in dun-colored plaster that mimics mud. But they are also vivid, animate, and expressive — adorable, even. One kneels on its front legs, perhaps drinking water. Another has plopped itself on its side, legs flailing in the air. Yet another, an adolescent with long legs and a head smaller than the rest, seems to be caught mid-trot, while a baby sploots on the floor. \nInstallation view Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea (© Duane Linklater, photo Bill Jacobson Studio, New York; courtesy Dia Art Foundation)\nThey are wallowing: rolling in the dirt, getting rid of critters on their coats, cooling off, smelling smells, picking up grass seeds that will fall off their bodies later, ensuring the spread of prairie grasses and brush. It is an instinctual, pleasurable behavior in which, according to curator Matilde Guidelli-Guidi, the animals do not indulge under conditions of captivity or duress. \nWhat does it take for buffalo to be at home, to be in an environment where they can not merely survive — which they’ve done despite the best efforts of American colonizers — but thrive? And by extension, what does it take for these sculpted buffalo, made by an artist who is Omasekêko Ininiwak from Moose Cree First Nation, to be at home in this art institution? \nLinklater undertakes a process of worldbuilding at Dia, a foundation that has historically supported artists (Smithson, Holt, De Maria, Heizer) who as often as not failed to register that the land they co-opted as site and material was and is homeland to Native people. The foundation, moreover, occupies an industrial space built upon layers and layers of history and topography, including Lenape tobacco fields. Linklater remaps the Chelsea space not only by turning it into a virtual prairie, marked out by the presence of buffalo, but also by extracting 12 cylindrical cores from the floor and substrate and replacing them with soil and granite discs from near his home in Northern Ontario. Two other boreholes remain empty, covered with glass so visitors can see what’s below. The 12 pieces of granite, arranged in a circle that transverses the two rooms, together with the two boreholes (the “12 + 2” of the piece’s title and that of the exhibition as a whole), mark out the pole placement of a teepee, an arrangement with cosmological significance — yet another form of mapping; one of Linklater’s cochineal-stained, charcoal-marked teepee covers, “parliament,” hangs from the rafters in the second gallery. The dug-up slag and concrete are presented in a steel trough nearby. The intervention recalls Robert Smithson’s “non-sites,” for which he brought materials like coal and rocks gathered from industrial wastelands in New Jersey and elsewhere into the gallery, connecting the white box to the outside world and to both the present and a deep geological past. But instead of merely bringing the outside in, Linklater also drills down, forcing us to deal with a very human-scaled chronology of displacement. \nPerformance of “bison bison (dance_hum for dirtbath),” written and choreographed by Tanya Lukin Linklater as part of Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea. On the wall in the background is Duane Linklater’s “wallowwallow” \nDespite his buffaloes’ monumentality, Linklater preserves the galleries’ vast openness to accommodate the work’s crucial performance component. On Saturdays afternoons, “bison bison (dance_hum for dirtbath)” takes place, written and choreographed by the artist Tanya Lukin Linklater, Duane Linklater’s wife and frequent collaborator. Over the course of 44 minutes, dancers pace around the room, experiencing this virtual landscape the way buffalo might. At times they undertake activities meant to honor or map it, as when a performer makes charcoal rubbings of the granite plugs in the floor. Their activities drive the music, “buffalounit,” composed by eagleswitheyesclosed (a collaboration between Linklater and his son Tobias) and played by a drummer, cellist, and bass guitarist. Over seven weeks, the number of dancers and musicians will winnow away, ending with a single percussionist and a single figure in motion.\nRendered in oil stick, paint, and graphite on three panels, “kitaskînaw_kitaskînawâw (every indian I know hates that song)” — the song in the title is, I suspect, the classic anthem of westward expansion, “Home on the Range” — recalls the history of abstract painting through its gestural strokes in red, white, and blue (plus touches of browns and beige) and size (it measures around 11 by 6.5 feet). But the marks also coalesce into a duck-rabbit image of a buffalo laying on its side and a rough map of the North American continent. In the other gallery is “wallowwallow,” a circular form made of soil, hay, clay, and brown, gray, and blue pigment on steel and surrounded by a halo applied directly to the brick wall. It is meant to suggest the hollows the buffalo make as they roll around on the soil, reshaping the landscape as they go, but it also reads as the Earth seen from space. Linklater ties the well-being of his buffalo to that of the Indigenous people with whom they have long lived symbiotically — and even to that of the world itself — not in nostalgic terms but in futurist ones via robotic buffalos and titles that suggest computer file names. As a whole, 12 + 2 seems to point us to an important truth: We live in a world that buffalo create. \n\nA buffalo sculpture from the installation “wallowposition” in Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea \nPerformance of “bison bison (dance_hum for dirtbath),” written and choreographed by Tanya Lukin Linklater as part of Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea \nA buffalo sculpture from the installation “wallowposition” in Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea\nInstallation view Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea (© Duane Linklater, photo Bill Jacobson Studio, New York; courtesy Dia Art Foundation)\nA buffalo sculpture from the installation “wallowposition” in Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea\nDuane Linklater: 12 + 2 continues at Dia Chelsea (537 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) through January 24, 2026.

    "body": "\n\tThe Smithsonian Institution, a Washington, D.C.–based network for museums that has repeatedly been attacked by the Trump administration, suffered yet one more blow this weekend as a continuing government shutdown forced it close for the foreseeable future.\n\n\tIt is not the first museum in Washington, D.C. to shutter because of the shutdown: the National Gallery of Art has been closed since last weekend. But the Smithsonian, whose 21 institutions include the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the National Portrait Gallery, is the largest-scale closure of its kind thus far.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tPreviously, the Smithsonian, which receives most of its funding from the US government, had used its own money to stay open. It initially planned to close on October 6, then extended its opening through October 11.\n\n\tDuring the last government shutdown, which took place between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, Smithsonian workers were left without pay. It wasn’t immediately clear what would happen this time around, though President Trump has suggested that federal workers who are furloughed would not automatically receive back pay. On Friday, the White House announced that it had begun another round of layoffs amid the shutdown. \n\n\tThe current government shutdown began on October 1 and is now in its second week. It derives from disagreements between Democrats and Republicans over health care policy. Before the shutdown set in, Democrats sought to undo health care cuts made by Republicans, while Republicans called on Democrats to accept their funding plan.\n\n\tHow the Smithsonian’s forthcoming programming will be impacted remains uncertain. Later this month, the Smithsonian American Art Museum is planning to open a Grandma Moses survey. The National Portrait Gallery already postponed an exhibition related to a recurring portraiture competition that was expected to open on October 18.\n\n\tThe Smithsonian has repeatedly found itself in the crosshairs of the Trump administration this year. In March, Trump issued an executive order denouncing the Smithsonian in which he claimed that it had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” He has since released a list of artworks on view at its museums that he appeared to condemn; some of them were related to migration and transgender identity. \n\n\n\tThe National Portrait Gallery has in particular been reshaped by the controversy. Its director, Kim Sajet, resigned after Trump claimed to have fired her. Also at that museum, artist Amy Sherald canceled a planned iteration of her traveling survey, claiming the institution censored her by asking her to remove a painting of a Black trans woman posing as the Statue of Liberty.\n",

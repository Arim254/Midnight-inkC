    "body": "\n\tin Books, Comics/Cartoons, Film, Law, Music |   \tJanuary 1st, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough it isn’t the kind of thing one hears dis­cussed every day, seri­ous Dis­ney fans do tend to know that Goofy’s orig­i­nal name was Dip­py Dawg. But how many of the non-obses­sive know that Mick­ey’s faith­ful pet Plu­to was first called Rover? (We pass over in dig­ni­fied silence the qua­si-philo­soph­i­cal ques­tion of why the for­mer dog is humanoid and the lat­ter isn’t.) It is Rover, as dis­tinct from Plu­to, who pass­es into the pub­lic domain this new year, one of a cast of now-lib­er­at­ed char­ac­ters includ­ing Blondie and Dag­wood as well as Bet­ty Boop — who, upon mak­ing her debut in Fleis­ch­er Stu­dios’ Dizzy Dish­es of 1930, has a some­what canoid appear­ance her­self. You can see them all in the video above from Duke Uni­ver­si­ty’s Cen­ter for the Study of the Pub­lic Domain, with much more infor­ma­tion avail­able in their blog post mark­ing this year’s “Pub­lic Domain Day.”\nThe year 1930, write the Cen­ter’s Jen­nifer Jenk­ins and James Boyle, was one “of detec­tives, jazz, speakeasies, and icon­ic char­ac­ters step­ping onto the cul­tur­al stage — many of whom have been locked behind copy­right for near­ly a cen­tu­ry.”\nNov­els that come avail­able this year include William Faulkn­er’s As I Lay Dying, Dashiell Ham­met­t’s The Mal­tese Fal­con, and Agatha Christie’s The Mur­der at the Vic­arage; among the films are Lewis Mile­stone’s Best Pic­ture-win­ning All Qui­et on the West­ern Front, Vic­tor Heer­man’s Marx Broth­ers pic­ture Ani­mal Crack­ers, and Luis Buñuel and Sal­vador Dalí’s L’Âge d’Or. In music, com­po­si­tions like “I Got Rhythm” and “Embrace­able You” by the Gersh­win Broth­ers as well as record­ings like “Nobody Knows the Trou­ble I’ve Seen” by Mar­i­an Ander­son and “Sweet Geor­gia Brown” by Ben Bernie and His Hotel Roo­sevelt Orches­tra have also, at long last, gone pub­lic.\nReflec­tion on some of these works them­selves sug­gests some­thing about the impor­tance of the pub­lic domain. With the title of Cakes and Ale, anoth­er book in this year’s crop, Som­er­set Maugh­am makes ref­er­ence to “a clas­sic pub­lic domain work, in this case Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night”; so, for that mat­ter, does Faulkn­er, giv­en that the line “as I lay dying” comes from the Odyssey. “To tell new sto­ries, we draw from old­er ones,” write Jenk­ins and Boyle. “One work of art inspires anoth­er — that is how the pub­lic domain feeds cre­ativ­i­ty.” Today, we’re free to take explic­it inspi­ra­tion for our own work from Nan­cy Drew, “Just a Gigo­lo,” Blondie, Mon­dri­an’s Com­po­si­tion with Red, Blue, and Yel­low, Hitch­cock­’s Mur­der!, and much else besides. And by all means use Rover, but if you also want to bring in Dip­py Dawg, you’re going to have to wait until 2028.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWhat’s Enter­ing the Pub­lic Domain in 2025: Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms, Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury, Ear­ly Hitch­cock Films, Tintin and Pop­eye Car­toons & More\nThe Harlem Jazz Singer Who Inspired Bet­ty Boop: Meet the Orig­i­nal Boop-Oop-a-Doop, “Baby Esther”\nCar­toon­ists Draw Their Famous Car­toon Char­ac­ters While Blind­fold­ed (1947)\nWatch Restored Ver­sions of Clas­sic Fleis­ch­er Car­toons on Youtube, Fea­tur­ing Bet­ty Boop, Koko the Clown & Oth­ers\nVin­tage Audio: William Faulkn­er Reads From As I Lay Dying\n16 Free Hitch­cock Movies Online\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tDecember 31st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt would­n’t sur­prise us to come across a Japan­ese per­son in Venice. Indeed, giv­en the glob­al touris­tic appeal of the place, we could hard­ly imag­ine a day there with­out a vis­i­tor from the Land of the Ris­ing Sun. But things were dif­fer­ent in 1873, just five years after the end of the sakoku pol­i­cy that all but closed Japan to the world for two and a half cen­turies. On a mis­sion to research the mod­ern ways of the new­ly acces­si­ble out­side world, a Japan­ese del­e­ga­tion arrived in Venice and found in the state archives two let­ters writ­ten in Latin by one of their coun­try­men, dat­ed 1615 and 1616. Its author seemed to have been an emis­sary of Ōto­mo Sōrin, a feu­dal lord who con­vert­ed to Chris­tian­i­ty and once sent a mis­sion of four teenagers to meet the Pope in Rome — a mis­sion that took place ear­li­er, in 1586.\nSo who could this undoc­u­ment­ed Japan­ese trav­el­er in the fif­teen-tens have been? That ques­tion lies at the heart of the sto­ry told by Evan “Nerd­writer” Puschak in his new video above. The let­ter’s sig­na­ture of Haseku­ra Roke­mon would’ve con­sti­tut­ed a major clue, but the name seems not to have rung a bell with any­one at the time.\n“In 1873, there was like­ly no one on plan­et Earth who knew why Haseku­ra Roke­mon was in Venice in 1615,” says Puschak. The rea­sons have to do with the arrival of Chris­tian­i­ty in Japan — or at least the arrival of the first major Jesuit mis­sion­ary — in 1549. Not every ruler looked kind­ly on their work, and espe­cial­ly not Toy­oto­mi Hideyoshi, who ordered them removed from the coun­try in 1587 and lat­er had 26 Catholics cru­ci­fied in Nagasa­ki.\nHideyoshi was suc­ceed­ed by the more tol­er­ant Toku­gawa Ieya­su (1543–1616), dur­ing whose rule the Japan­ese-speak­ing Fran­cis­can fri­ar Luis Sote­lo arrived in Japan. Over the ensu­ing decade, he worked not just to spread his faith but also to build hos­pi­tals, one of which suc­cess­ful­ly treat­ed a Euro­pean con­cu­bine of the feu­dal lord Date Masamune. The two men got on, real­iz­ing the mutu­al ben­e­fit their rela­tion­ship could bring: per­haps Sote­lo could found a new dio­cese in Date’s north­ern ter­ri­to­ry, and per­haps Date could estab­lish links with the Span­ish empire. In order to accom­plish the lat­ter, he had a ship built and a team assem­bled for a mis­sion to Europe, includ­ing Sote­lo him­self. He sent with them a loy­al retain­er, a samu­rai by the name of Haseku­ra Roke­mon — or to use his full name, Haseku­ra Rokue­mon Tsune­na­ga, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture for his meet­ing with the pope and adop­tion of Roman cit­i­zen­ship. He may have been Japan­ese, but a mere tourist he cer­tain­ly was­n’t.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe 17th Cen­tu­ry Japan­ese Samu­rai Who Sailed to Europe, Met the Pope & Became a Roman Cit­i­zen\n21 Rules for Liv­ing from Miyamo­to Musashi, Japan’s Samu­rai Philoso­pher (1584–1645)\nA Mis­chie­vous Samu­rai Describes His Rough-and-Tum­ble Life in 19th Cen­tu­ry Japan\nHow to Be a Samu­rai: A 17th Cen­tu­ry Code for Life & War\nHand-Col­ored 1860s Pho­tographs Reveal the Last Days of Samu­rai Japan\nMeet Yasuke, Japan’s First Black Samu­rai War­rior\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as industrialization swelled and advances in science and health paralleled social and economic transformation, artists searched for ways to express the changing times. Fatigued with the traditions and values of conservative society, which increasingly felt at odds with the way the world was heading, artists began to seek new visual languages in painting, architecture, and design.\nWhat started as dalliances with non-academic painting in the late 1800s—think Vincent van Gogh and the Impressionists—burgeoned into a full-throttle movement, especially after World War I. Kasimir Malevich’s “Black Square” (1913), for one, marked a turning point in Western art when he broke down the boundary between representation and abstraction—it’s thought to be the first time an artist made a work that wasn’t of something. After World War II, modernism took off, and its influence on art continues to resonate around the globe.\nYayanagi Go (Tsuyoshi), “Flower Like the Blue Sky” (1982), silkscreen print, 15 1/2 × 15 1/2 inches. © Tsuyoshi (Go) Yayanagi. Image courtesy of Kumo Arts\nDuring the early-to-mid-20th century in Japan, creatives and tastemakers looked to both their own traditions, such as the rich legacy of ukiyo-e, and to the West. Forthcoming from Penguin Random House, Modern Japanese Printmakers: New Waves and Eruptions celebrates the trailblazing artists who innovated unique techniques, merged traditional mediums with new methods, and reveled in experimentation.\nAs Japan’s consumer culture blossomed in the early 20th century, and society adopted technologies and pop culture influences from abroad, artists also embraced modernity. Takea Hideo, for example, reimagines ukiyo-e imagery into surreal, dreamlike tableaux. And Funsaka Yoshiuke creates playful chromatic experiments using repeated motifs like lemons, black dots, grids, and multi-hued strips of color.\nAuthored by Malene Wagner, the volume covers the gamut of printmaking techniques, from woodblock and lithograph to silkscreen and monoprints, illuminating the virtually endless ways artists can translate imagery onto paper.\nModern Japanese Printmakers contains more than 100 full-page images and highlights a wide range of practices, from Ay-O’s explosively vibrant, psychedelic compositions to Ruth Asawa’s lithographs exploring the relationship between nature and geometry. Slated for release on January 13, the book is available for pre-order now on Bookshop.\nRuth Asawa, “Dessert Plant (TAM.1460)” (1965), lithograph. © 2025 Ruth Asawa Lanier, Inc., courtesy of David Zwirner\nTakea Hideo, “The Heike Clan’s Capital” from the series ‘Genpei’ (1985-99), silkscreen print, 20 3/4 × 15 1/2 inches. © Hideo Takeda\nYoshida Hodaka, “Mambo” (1956), monoprint, 32 3/4 × 46 1/2 inches. © Ayomi Yoshida\nAy-O, “Well!

The Spanish artist, who died this week at the age of 94, rose to fame and notoriety in the 2010s for her delightful “restoration” of “Ecce Homo,” a fresco of Jesus in a Zaragoza church. The face that launched a million memes, affectionately known as “Beast Jesus,” may not have inspired religious ecstasy, but it birthed a cultural icon. Today, Staff Writer Isa Farfan commemorates Giménez's life and improbable legacy alongside a selection of “Beast Jesus” stories from our archive.Speaking of icons, Heated Rivalry, the hit Canadian show about two hockey stars who fall for each other and navigate their sexuality, is quickly on its way to cult status. Staff Writer Rhea Nayyar examines the meme trends inspired by the steamy queer series, many of them harvested by Hyperallergic's very own Heated Rivalry fan, co-founder and Editor-at-Large Hrag Vartanian.  — Valentina Di Liscia, senior editorCecilia Giménez with her restoration of Ecce Homo in 2013 (photo by Fabián Simón ARCHDC/Alamy)Cecilia Giménez, Whose Botched Restoration Became an Icon, Dies at 94The Spanish artist delighted the world with her intervention on a church fresco lovingly dubbed “Beast Jesus.” | Isa Farfan\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Black Mountain College Prize Awarded to Rosana PaulinoEach year, Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center awards a $20,000 grant to an artist based anywhere in the world working in the spirit of BMC.\n                        \n                        \n                            Learn more\n                        \n                    \n            NewsSo much for watching it for the plot.

Photos from Lviv, Ukraine, show people celebrating Malanka Pereberia — a folk holiday that includes house visits, songs, costumes, and mask-making. (photo by Mykola Tys/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) \n    \n        \n            What makes a year? The Earth's orbit around the sun, with shifting light shaping our days, weather, and seasons. Boris Acket and Studio Airport's \"Five Studies on Light\" is part film, part interactive exploration — a mesmerizing meditation on how light bends, scatters, and defines what we see, in Emergence Magazine: It is light, in its many permutations, that gives form to the cycle of Earth’s seasons. As our planet tilts and orbits around the Sun, the shifting angles of light create rhythms that shape temperature and weather, and beyond that, entire ecosystems, human cultures, and our deepest sense of time and place.Variation—and its absence—is central to our experience of these rhythms. The changing light of the seasons is more than a visual phenomenon; it is a cosmic metronome. Without these fluctuations, time would feel adrift, and the intricate ecological, emotional, spiritual systems built on light would begin to unravel.Does this article find you hungover, recovering, or perfectly fine? However you feel this New Year's Day, dive into Tiarna Meehan's round-up of 2025's most hedonistic dance-floor photos — an exploration of nightlife's political and aesthetic power — for Dazed:Amid venue closures, police raids and the rising cost of nightlife, clubs have become increasingly endangered in 2025. As a result, it’s become the subject of panel talks, crowdfunding campaigns, and a slew of thinkpieces asking what nightlife is worth and who it’s really for.And yet, with the club more endangered than ever, it was the people who showed up who kept things moving. Promoters, performers, dancers and door staff continued to turn up night after night, refusing to let the lights go out quietly. In the face of uncertainty, the dance floor remained a place of resistance.Those giant gaps around public bathroom doors weren't always standard. In fact, things were once much, much worse. My New Year's resolution: Remember that the next time I'm making eye contact with someone through a gap in the stall. Calvin Gimpelevich writes on the history of the public bathroom for the Los Angeles Review of Books: Like us, the Romans suffered constipation, diarrhea, gluey or ropy or viscous stools; like us, they had to wipe off. For this reason, it is hypothesized, the small shallow gutter running before forica benches provided a constant flow of water within easy reach. Romans may have scooped water to cleanse with, or used it to rinse xylospongia—sponge sticks, a Roman classic, featuring sea sponges fixed to wood rods. Some academics declare, emphatically, that the sponges were used to wipe with, while others insist they were more like toilet brushes for mopping external spills. Alternate materials—papyrus, plant husks, wood shavings, corncobs, and rags—have been found and used as evidence of the latter theory, but most experts believe the sponges were indeed a form of recyclable toilet paper. Seneca recounts the story of a German prisoner, condemned to public execution, who asked to use the toilet and “seized the stick of wood, tipped with a sponge, which was devoted to the vilest uses, and stuffed it, just as it was, down his throat; thus he blocked up his windpipe, and choked the breath from his body,” rather than face the savage beasts of the arena. As comfortable as they may have been about digestive matters, Romans were not free of disgust: “Yes, indeed,” Seneca writes, “it was not a very elegant or becoming way to die; but what is more foolish than to be over-nice about dying?”Flossie the cat just turned 30! Dylan Horetski writes for Dexerto:At the time of her record confirmation, Guinness World Records noted that Flossie was deaf and had limited eyesight, but was otherwise in good health. She maintained a daily routine that included eating, sleeping, and playing.Flossie is currently recognized as the oldest living cat in the world. She is also one of the seven oldest verified cats in recorded history.As New York City says goodbye to the iconic MetroCard, meet Thomas McKean, who turns them into gorgeous collages and sculptures: \n  @newyorknico Tomorrow, the MetroCard officially becomes a relic of the past. Introduced in 1993, it replaced subway tokens and became a daily ritual for millions of New Yorkers. It lived in our wallets for over 30 years and quietly carried the city through workdays, late nights, and everything in between. On the eve of its discontinuation, I linked up with my friend Thomas McKean, a New York artist who’s spent decades collecting used MetroCards and turning them into intricate collages and sculptures. Thomas believes the MetroCard was one of the rare objects that connected New Yorkers across every neighborhood, job, and background. No matter who you were, you had one in your wallet. A small piece of plastic that belonged to everyone. Now officially history. ♬ original sound - Nicolas Heller   \nForget Times Square.

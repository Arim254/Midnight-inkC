The population of the otherworldly pink marine creatures found in reefs off the coast of New South Wales has seen a staggering decrease in the past few years—90% between 2011 and 2021 alone. Peering up from the base, he portrays the delicate stalks as if they’re towering trees.\nAdditional category winners include close-ups of a wide range of both marine and terrestrial wildlife, from insects and arachnids to mammals and amphibians.  Colossal readers might also recognize the work of Barry Webb, who captures incredibly detailed portraits of minuscule slime molds.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nA parrot confined to a too-small cage, jellyfish floating above fungi and ferns, and a spotted octopus resting as the centerpiece to a flourishing bouquet are a few of the surreal scenes in the works of Martin Wittfooth. The artist is known for his enigmatic paintings that meld flora and fauna to consider interconnection and nature’s endurance.\nWittfooth currently splits his time between Savannah and Brockville, although he plans to relocate permanently to the latter this year. Before he begins preparing for a solo exhibition in spring 2027 with Hashimoto Contemporary, the artist is completing a few larger commissions. \n“Dam”\nHe enjoys the balance between larger bodies of work and singular pieces: “A unified field of concepts and vibes, to have all of the pieces in an exhibition have a kind of kindred dialogue going on between one another, and then when the dust settles in between shows, to have singular works to focus on, where I can slow down just a bit and let the new ideas start to form for the next show,” he says.\nAlong with Yuko Shimizu, Wittfooth will also mentor at the unique Quarantine residency this April. This is his third time participating in the program, and it’s one that informs much of the way he thinks about connection. He’s always impressed by “how quickly bonds form between the students, between the mentors, between the students and the mentors, and with the whole crew that runs the show,” he says, adding: \n\nThere’s been a lot of emphasis on this notion that community is important—as a species, we’ve appreciated this in our various ways for as long as we’ve been around—but for artists, this is often a bit of a struggle to develop and to maintain, considering the isolating nature of how we work. It’s also something that seems to have become more broadly murky and confused in this era of social media, with person-to-person contact being replaced by virtual interactions and projection of virtual selves—methods of communication that I personally feel are missing the essential ingredient of connection.\n\nYou can find more about the program on Colossal, and explore Wittfooth’s work on his website and Instagram.\n“Parallelism Jellyfish 2”\n“The Alchemist”\n“Parallelism Paradise”\n“Liberty”\n“Parallelism 9”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(all screenshots via Department of Justice)In a document containing photographs sent to Jeffrey Epstein’s personal email address, the Department of Justice (DOJ) made a curious redaction, placing a black square on the face of one of the most ubiquitous portraits in the world. While the DOJ faces intense scrutiny for releasing sensitive information about Epstein's victims, including social security numbers and uncensored nude photos, in its recent document release, the federal agency decided to cover the face of what appears to be a reproduction of Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.”The altered “Mona Lisa” appears in a document containing photographs emailed to Epstein in 2009, with the subject line “simply paris.” Several photos in the email portray a young couple, including a woman whose face is redacted and an unnamed man. Photos in the email show the young couple at famous tourist destinations in Paris, including the Arc de Triomphe and inside the Louvre Museum.Redacted photos in a July 2009 email to Epstein titled \"simply paris\"The redacted image of Mona Lisa appears to be a reproduction of the artwork, not the actual painting, though in another photograph in the email, an individual can be seen walking past the glass-covered painting hanging in the Louvre. “We just walked around all over the city not just the sight seeing [sic]... we took like 1500 pictures so was really difficult to decide wich [sic] to send!” the email, sent by a redacted contact, said.The email is dated July 3, 2009, weeks before Epstein was released from jail following his Florida conviction for charges including soliciting prostitution from a minor. The redaction of the Mona Lisa feels particularly misguided as the DOJ faces accusations of releasing identifying information about about 100 Epstein survivors in their latest release of documents related to the convicted child sex offender. One lawyer for a survivor claimed his client was named over 500 times in the files. According to the New York Times, 40 images contained unredacted nude photos and the faces of seven individuals. After the publication notified the DOJ, a spokesperson said it was in the process of making proper redactions. The most recent tranche of Epstein files has also revealed new connections between the disgraced financier and art world figures. David A. Ross, the former chair of the School of Visual Arts MFA Art Practice Department, resigned from his post following the release of his email exchanges with Epstein. Emails also showed that Jeff Koons attended a dinner at Epstein's home years after his conviction.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Jeffrey Epstein\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n                News\n                Local artist Phil Buehler said he unveiled the memorial display to help people “see something that they otherwise can't see.”\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Phil Buehler's public art installation \"Wall of Tears\" in Bushwick (all images Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)\n    \n        \n            Spanning the 50-foot stretch between a hipster tea shop and a bar proudly displaying anti-ICE posters in Bushwick, a public installation by Brooklyn-based artist and photographer Phil Buehler confronts passersby with the names of the estimated 18,500 children killed by Israel in Gaza from October 2023 to July 2025. Amid freezing temperatures on Thursday, February 5, many pedestrians scurried past the list of names on Buehler’s temporary “Wall of Tears,” which is fastened to a fence at 12 Grattan Street with zip ties. Others walking by paused to read the names listed on the banner.Buehler is a Bronx-raised photographer whose public art projects have included portraits of the empty beds of Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces and documentation of Ferguson in mourning after the killing of Michael Brown. His latest work, produced in collaboration with Radio Free Brooklyn, will remain on view until February 15.  The wall lists 18,457 names of children reported dead by the Gaza Health Ministry from October 2023 to July 19, 2025.In a phone call with Hyperallergic, Buehler said he drew the names of children from data compiled by the Gaza Health Ministry, which was also reported by the Washington Post last summer. The names are arranged by date of death, and their documented gender is indicated by one of two shades of tan. The age of babies who were killed before their first birthday is marked by “<1.” The data set ends in July 2025. Buehler has created other banner-type works, including a 2022 “Wall of Liars and Deniers,” a 50-foot-long composition of Trump allies’ claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Another piece, “Wall of Shame” (2025), chronicled the alleged crimes of January 6 insurrectionists.Though similar in form, his latest memorial takes a different tone from his Trump-related works. Buehler said he read the Post's July report on the death toll among Gaza's children and wanted to use art to ensure that the information reaches as many people as possible.“I think art gets into your brain a different way than if you read a newspaper or social media. You can see it. It might be mysterious. It makes you discover something. It gets past some of your filters,” Buehler said. The installation will be on view until February 15.Buehler unveiled the work on the second anniversary of the death of five-year-old Hind Rajab, who was killed by the Israeli military while riding in her family's car on January 29, 2024. The moments leading up to Rajab’s murder were captured in a harrowing recording of the girl’s final pleas for help to Red Cross workers, sparking international outrage over Israel’s killing of Palestinian children. Among the 18,457 names on Buehler’s 50-by-10-foot banner, a ubiquitous graduation photo of Rajab peers out at Grattan Street. Photos of other children are interspersed with the other names on the display. An entry documenting the circumstances of the killing of Hind Rajab in 2024On Thursday, Buehler told Hyperallergic that he was preparing to invite local officials, including Mayor Zohran Mamdani, to an upcoming event at the Bushwick site this weekend.  He said he had recently come across a James Baldwin quote from 1973: “The role of the artist is exactly the same as the role of the lover. If I love you, I have to make you conscious of the things you don’t see.” This line prompted Buehler to reflect on his own work, including “Wall of Tears.”“Some people don't want to see things, or are unconscious of them,” Buehler said. “In addition to just adding more eyeballs to the story, I'm hoping maybe it opens some minds, or opens people to see something that they otherwise can't see.” Phil Buehler has produced other banner-type works and enlarged photographs commemorating children whose lives were upended by violence.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Palestine\n                      \n                  \n        ",

She achieved this by reintroducing the hand and drawing into painting at a time when it was dominated by a stylized aesthetic, while utilizing different media and processes in each work: Using oil paint, acrylic, flashe, oil stick, ink, ballpoint pen, colored pencil, markers, and other diverse, seemingly incommensurable materials, she stains the canvas, creates flat and feathery shapes, and defines open-ended, linear constructions. The result is a cacophonous symphony of individual marks, shapes, and colors that somehow coheres without obscuring the individuality of each element. Her tour de force compositions feel discovered in the process of their becoming. The 13 paintings, three ballpoint pen drawings, and five ceramic sculptures in her current exhibition, Amnesia, at Nino Mier Gallery (all untitled and dated between 2010 and 2025) reveal even more sides of her multi-pronged approach to art. For example, she’s used a metallic glaze for one ceramic work, and silver leaf and an oil-based Sharpie for another. It is as if different people made them, but all are somehow Joanne Greenbaum. Joanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2014), oil, acrylic, flashe and graphite on canvasIn a conversation with artist Amy Sillman, Greenbaum said of her creative process:I don’t really scrape away. I just keep adding until the painting feels like it doesn’t need anything more. But there has to be lots of air in there, otherwise it’s claustrophobic.In a 2014 painting, colored lines coalesce into various configurations, which peek through flat, curving, monochromatic, and puzzle-like shapes rendered in a variety of oranges, blues, reds, pinks, and violets. Placed atop this layered composition is a large, slitted black form that seems to alternate between two and three dimensionality. While the different strata feel connected, it is unclear how, as she’s followed no discernible formula. As powerful as this combination of elements is, Greenbaum doesn’t turn it into a recipe for success — there is no other painting like this in Amnesia.Joanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2016), ballpoint pen, marker, and flashe on canvasJoanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2016), oil-based Sharpie on white stonewareFor a 2016 work, Greenbaum draws irregular concentric circles in ballpoint pen that culminate in an opaque spot near the center. The composition is reminiscent of water emptying down a drain, yet the bubble gum pink ground severs any connection we might make to a real-life scene while elevating the imagery into something that can only happen in paint. Greenbaum is disinterested in resemblance; however, her ability to evoke associations, even as she underscores that we are looking at paint and marks on a canvas, is one of the interesting paradoxes of her art. The dimensional blue and pink shape in a 2013 work looks like nothing we know, while a 2025 painting might bring to mind an aerial view of a futuristic city. That Greenbaum can traverse a perceptual territory that moves from object to place to action without ever crossing the line into representation is just one of the many pleasures of her art. There is an infectious fun to it that has nothing to do with style or statement. That deep-seated satisfaction of making something wild out of the banal — which is rare in art and poetry — can also be found in Joe Brainard’s experimental memoir, I Remember (1970), and the poetry of Frank O’Hara, who wrote “Grace to be born and live as variously as possible.”Joanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2013), oil, ink, acrylic, oil stick, and colored pencil on canvasJoanne Greenbaum: Amnesia continues at Nino Mier Gallery (62 Crosby Street, Soho, Manhattan) through February 21.

Not the kind that arrives with a public failure or a dramatic ending. This shame is quieter. It settles in the body. It convinces you not to tell anyone. It suggests that if you were more responsible, more successful, more organized, this would not have happened. It tells you that asking for help would only confirm what you already fear, that you were never supposed to need it in the first place.Years ago, I couldn’t afford the payment on a storage unit in the neighborhood of Greenpoint in north Brooklyn, where I had been keeping a large portion of my work. Sculptural components, unfinished pieces, modular elements, things that only made sense in relation to one another. The unit was auctioned off. There was no intervention, no warning. The archive simply changed hands.About a year later, a friend sent me an Instagram post and asked, almost casually, if the work in the background was mine. I recognized it immediately. Pieces from that storage unit were staged as interior décor by a Philadelphia-based vintage design shop. When I looked further, I found multiple posts offering parts of the work for sale. Not complete pieces, but components of singular works. Individual elements were photographed, priced, and listed under my name without tagging or contacting me. At the time, I had no idea this was happening. Parts of my practice were being dismantled, circulated, and monetized without my knowledge, their meaning flattened into décor.This was not just the loss of objects. It was the loss of authorship, sequencing, and context. Works that were never meant to exist independently were broken apart and reintroduced to the world as aesthetic fragments. My archive had become modular in the most violent sense. Not by choice, but by necessity and market indifference.In Archive Fever, Jacques Derrida describes the archive not as a neutral container, but as a site of authority, anxiety, and exclusion. The archive is never just about preservation. It is about who gets to decide what is kept, how it is ordered, and who has access to it. Losing control of my work was not only a material loss. It was a loss of archival authority. A reminder that preservation is always entangled with power, and that power rarely rests with the artist once the work leaves their hands.Artists are rarely taught how to talk about this. We are trained to see our studios as sacred spaces and our archives as extensions of ourselves. What we are not given are the material conditions to protect them. Storage, when you are living project to project, grant to grant, becomes a ticking clock. Miss one payment and the evidence of your labor is no longer yours.Public storage is sold as neutral infrastructure, a convenience. For artists, it is often a site of profound vulnerability. These spaces are subject to floods, fires, mold, theft, rodents, and power failures. They are not designed to preserve culture. They are designed to extract monthly fees. The longer you stay solvent, the longer your work survives. The moment you falter, the archive becomes disposable.In September of last year, a fire tore through an iconic artist studio building in Brooklyn, destroying decades of work in a matter of hours. Studios that had housed entire careers were reduced to debris overnight. The loss was not abstract. It was total. What that fire made visible was not only the fragility of materials, but the absence of meaningful infrastructure to protect artists’ archives before catastrophe strikes. Disaster does not discriminate, but its consequences do. Artists without generational wealth, without secondary storage, without institutional backing are always the most exposed. That fire was not an anomaly. It was part of a longer pattern of loss that artists have been absorbing quietly for years.One of the structural conditions that makes archival precarity so acute is the constant threat of environmental disaster. Storms, floods, fires, and other climate events can erase entire bodies of work in a matter of hours. After Hurricane Sandy, galleries in Chelsea were still recovering years later, with basement studios, storage spaces, and ground-floor archives damaged or destroyed by floodwaters that swept through downtown Manhattan. More than a decade on, the scars of that event are still felt, not only in the work that was lost, but in the ways artists and institutions continue to relate to space, risk, and memory. Dealers and artists alike were left to rebuild what had been made vulnerable by an infrastructure that placed cultural material below flood lines and away from meaningful protection. The question that lingered was not only financial but existential. How do you reconstruct the thread of a practice when its physical record has been submerged? This history is not distant. It is a reminder that the systems surrounding art storage and display remain brittle in the face of storms that climate scientists now tell us are worsening, and that preservation in the arts is still treated as an individual responsibility rather than a shared obligation.Family photograph of the artist and his brother, c. 1988 One of the works that was broken apart and sold off from my storage unit had been part of my exhibition For Demetrius at the Sugar Hill Children’s Museum in 2019. The show was named for my late brother, who died from sickle cell disease in 2009, and it marked the tenth anniversary of his passing. That work was never meant to circulate casually. It was an act of remembrance, a way of holding grief in form. Knowing that it had been dismantled and redistributed without context was emotionally devastating in a way that is difficult to explain. It felt like a second loss, quieter than the first, but no less final.Recently, news circulated about a breakthrough gene therapy that has effectively cured sickle cell disease in at least one patient. I read it with a complicated mix of relief and grief. Scientific progress arrived too late to change my brother’s life, just as recognition arrived too late to protect the work that bore his name. These timelines do not align. They rarely do. What remains is the knowledge that some forms of care only appear after loss has already done its work.What connects the storage unit, the fire, and the auction is not just money. It is performance. Artists are expected to perform being okay when they often are not. The art world rewards the appearance of stability. It punishes visible need.In my previous writing about art auctions, I was thinking about spectacle. About how auctions stage confidence, inevitability, and demand. How value is performed in real time, with no room for hesitation. What becomes clearer here is the psychic toll of that performance. Auctions teach us that worth must never waver. The hammer comes down. The price is set. Everyone pretends this outcome was natural.Shame enters when an artist’s reality cannot sustain that fiction.There is shame in admitting you cannot afford storage. Shame in saying you missed a payment. Shame in asking for help before the crisis becomes irreversible. Shame in revealing that the archive, the thing institutions later rely on to narrate your significance, is one accident away from disappearance. This shame is not incidental. It is structural. It keeps artists performing competence while absorbing risk privately.Artists learn early how to be okay. We learn how to downplay instability. We learn how to smile through precarity. We learn how to turn survival into narrative resilience. What we do not learn is how to ask for help without fear of being seen as unprofessional or unviable. Silence feels safer, even when it isn’t. What often goes unacknowledged is that these moments do not end when the immediate crisis passes. Like storms or fires, they leave scars that shape how artists move through the world long after the damage is no longer visible.The auction clarifies the asymmetry. When work appears at auction, it is framed as success regardless of whether the artist benefits. When work is lost through a storage auction, it is framed as personal failure. Both are auctions. Only one is allowed to confer legitimacy. The other produces silence.\"When work is lost through a storage auction, it is framed as personal failure.\" Family photo of artist with his brother. This is why shame becomes part of the archive. Not just the shame of losing work, but the shame of nearly losing it. The shame of hiding instability. The shame of knowing the system prefers artists who can absorb risk quietly. These residues accumulate alongside objects, sketches, files, and fragments. They shape what artists keep, what they discard, and what they stop trusting themselves to hold.In this sense, the precarious archive is not only material. It is psychological. It is the ongoing labor of maintaining the appearance of being okay long enough for the market to catch up, or for institutions to intervene, or for history to decide you were worth preserving. When that performance fails, the consequences are real.If the archive is precarious, survival cannot be an individual project. Fred Moten, writing with Stefano Harney in The Undercommons, offers language for thinking about life and labor outside institutional recognition. The undercommons names the informal, relational networks people build when official structures fail them. For many artists, this is already how preservation works, through shared storage, borrowed space, mutual aid, and artist-run experiments that refuse the logic of scarcity.There are no perfect solutions, only survival strategies. Some artists digitize aggressively. Some make rules about what must remain intact and what can be released. Some negotiate storage with galleries or collectors. Some rely on friends, informal networks, or shared spaces. Writing becomes an archive too, a way of preserving intention when material evidence is unstable.None of this erases the underlying problem. It names it. The precarious archive is not an anomaly. It is a condition of contemporary artistic life. It asks artists to imagine a future audience while living in a present that offers very little security.To name this is not to confess failure. It is to refuse the lie that artists are solely responsible for their own erasure. The archive is not just a personal burden. It is a cultural infrastructure. If we care about artists’ legacies, we have to care about the conditions under which those legacies are allowed to survive, long before the market decides they matter.For now, many artists continue to work knowing their archives exist on borrowed time. One missed payment. One storm. One fire. The work persists anyway, not because the system protects it, but because artists keep making it.That endurance deserves more than silence.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nIn his 1935 essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechan­i­cal Repro­ducibil­i­ty,” influ­en­tial Ger­man-Jew­ish crit­ic Wal­ter Ben­jamin intro­duced the term “aura” to describe an authen­tic expe­ri­ence of art. Aura relates to the phys­i­cal prox­im­i­ty between objects and their view­ers. Its loss, Ben­jamin argued, was a dis­tinct­ly 20th-cen­tu­ry phe­nom­e­non caused by mass media’s impo­si­tion of dis­tance between object and view­er, though it appears to bring art clos­er through a sim­u­la­tion of inti­ma­cy.\nThe essay makes for potent read­ing today. Mass media — which for Ben­jamin meant radio, pho­tog­ra­phy, and film — turns us all into poten­tial actors, crit­ics, experts, he wrote, and takes art out of the realm of the sacred and into the realm of the spec­ta­cle. Yet it retains the pre­tense of rit­u­al. We make offer­ings to cults of per­son­al­i­ty, expand­ed in our time to include influ­encers and revered and reviled bil­lion­aires and polit­i­cal fig­ures who joust in the head­lines like pro­fes­sion­al wrestlers, led around by the chief of all heels. As Ben­jamin writes:\n\nThe film responds to the shriv­el­ing of the aura with an arti­fi­cial build-up of the “per­son­al­i­ty” out­side the stu­dio. The cult of the movie star,  fos­tered by the mon­ey of the film indus­try, pre­serves not the unique aura of the per­son but the “spell of the per­son­al­i­ty,” the pho­ny spell of a com­mod­i­ty. \n\nBenjamin’s focus on the medi­um as not only expres­sive but con­sti­tu­tive of mean­ing has made his essay a sta­ple on com­mu­ni­ca­tions and media the­o­ry course syl­labi, next to the work of Mar­shall McLuhan. Many read­ings tend to leave aside the pol­i­tics of its epi­logue, like­ly since “his rem­e­dy,” writes Mar­tin Jay — “the politi­ciza­tion of art by Com­mu­nism — was for­got­ten by all but his most mil­i­tant Marx­ist inter­preters,” and hard­ly seemed like much of a rem­e­dy dur­ing the Cold War, when Ben­jamin became more wide­ly avail­able in trans­la­tion.\nBenjamin’s own idio­syn­crat­ic pol­i­tics aside, his essay antic­i­pates a cri­sis of author­ship and author­i­ty cur­rent­ly sur­fac­ing in the use of social media as a dom­i­nant form of polit­i­cal spec­ta­cle.\n\nWith the increas­ing exten­sion of the press, which kept plac­ing new polit­i­cal, reli­gious, sci­en­tif­ic, pro­fes­sion­al, and local organs before the read­ers, an increas­ing num­ber of read­ers became writers—at first, occa­sion­al ones. It began with the dai­ly press open­ing to its read­ers space for “let­ters to the edi­tor.” And today there is hard­ly a gain­ful­ly employed Euro­pean who could not, in prin­ci­ple, find an oppor­tu­ni­ty to pub­lish some­where or oth­er com­ments on his work, griev­ances, doc­u­men­tary reports, or that sort of thing. Thus, the dis­tinc­tion between author and pub­lic is about to lose its basic char­ac­ter.\n\nBenjamin’s analy­sis of con­ven­tion­al film, espe­cial­ly, leads him to con­clude that its recep­tion required so lit­tle of view­ers that they eas­i­ly become dis­tract­ed. Everyone’s a crit­ic, but “at the movies this posi­tion requires no atten­tion. The pub­lic is an exam­in­er, but an absent-mind­ed one.” Pas­sive con­sump­tion and habit­u­al dis­trac­tion do not make for con­sid­ered, informed opin­ion or a healthy sense of pro­por­tion.\nWhat Ben­jamin referred to (in trans­la­tion) as mechan­i­cal repro­ducibil­i­ty we might now just call The Inter­net (and the coter­ies of “things” it haunts pol­ter­geist-like). Lat­er the­o­rists influ­enced by Ben­jamin fore­saw our age of dig­i­tal repro­ducibil­i­ty doing away with the need for authen­tic objects, and real peo­ple, alto­geth­er. Ben­jamin him­self might char­ac­ter­ize a medi­um that can ful­ly detach from the phys­i­cal world and the mate­r­i­al con­di­tions of its users — a medi­um in which every­one gets a col­umn, pub­lic pho­to gallery, and video pro­duc­tion stu­dio — as ide­al­ly suit­ed to the aims of fas­cism.\n\nFas­cism attempts to orga­nize the new­ly cre­at­ed pro­le­tar­i­an mass­es with­out affect­ing the prop­er­ty struc­ture which the mass­es strive to elim­i­nate. Fas­cism sees its sal­va­tion in giv­ing these mass­es not their right, but instead a chance to express them­selves. The mass­es have a right to change prop­er­ty rela­tions; Fas­cism seeks to give them an expres­sion while pre­serv­ing prop­er­ty. The log­i­cal result of Fas­cism is the intro­duc­tion of aes­thet­ics into polit­i­cal life.\n\nThe log­i­cal result of turn­ing pol­i­tics into spec­ta­cle for the sake of pre­serv­ing inequal­i­ty, writes Ben­jamin, is the roman­ti­ciza­tion of war and slaugh­ter, glo­ri­fied plain­ly in the Ital­ian Futur­ist man­i­festo of Fil­ip­po Marinet­ti and the lit­er­ary work of Nazi intel­lec­tu­als like Ernst Jünger. Ben­jamin ends the essay with a dis­cus­sion of how fas­cism aes­theti­cizes pol­i­tics to one end: the anni­hi­la­tion of aura by more per­ma­nent means.\nUnder the rise of fas­cism in Europe, Ben­jamin saw that human “self-alien­ation has reached such a degree that it can expe­ri­ence its own destruc­tion as an aes­thet­ic plea­sure of the first order. This is the sit­u­a­tion of pol­i­tics which Fas­cism is ren­der­ing aes­thet­ic.” Those who par­tic­i­pate in this spec­ta­cle seek mass vio­lence “to sup­ply the artis­tic grat­i­fi­ca­tion of a sense per­cep­tion that has been changed by tech­nol­o­gy.” Dis­tract­ed and desen­si­tized, they seek, that is, to com­pen­sate for pro­found dis­em­bod­i­ment and the loss of mean­ing­ful, authen­tic expe­ri­ence.\nYou can read Ben­jam­in’s essay here, or find it in this col­lect­ed vol­ume.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent: \nUmber­to Eco Makes a List of the 14 Com­mon Fea­tures of Fas­cism\nToni Mor­ri­son Lists the 10 Steps That Lead Coun­tries to Fas­cism (1995)\nAre You a Fas­cist?: Take Theodor Adorno’s Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Test Cre­at­ed to Com­bat Fas­cism (1947)\nThe Sto­ry of Fas­cism: Rick Steves’ Doc­u­men­tary Helps Us Learn from the Hard Lessons of the 20th Cen­tu­ry\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin History, Math, Technology |   \tJanuary 28th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nGladys Mae West was born in rur­al Vir­ginia in 1930, grew up work­ing on a tobac­co farm, and died ear­li­er this month a cel­e­brat­ed math­e­mati­cian whose work made pos­si­ble the GPS tech­nol­o­gy most of us use each and every day. Hers was a dis­tinc­tive­ly Amer­i­can life, in more ways than one. Seek­ing an escape from the agri­cul­tur­al labor she’d already got­ten to know all too well, she won a schol­ar­ship to Vir­ginia State Col­lege by becom­ing her high school class vale­dic­to­ri­an; after earn­ing her bach­e­lor’s and mas­ter’s degrees in math­e­mat­ics, she taught for a time and then applied for a job at the naval base up in Dahlgren. She first dis­tin­guished her­self there by ver­i­fy­ing the accu­ra­cy of bomb­ing tables with a hand cal­cu­la­tor, and from there moved on up to the com­put­er pro­gram­ming team.\nThis was the ear­ly nine­teen-six­ties, when pro­gram­ming a com­put­er meant not cod­ing, but labo­ri­ous­ly feed­ing punch cards into an enor­mous main­frame. West and her col­leagues used IBM’s first tran­sis­tor­ized machine, the 7030 (or “Stretch”), which was for a few years the fastest com­put­er in the world.\nIt cost an equiv­a­lent of $81,860,000 in today’s dol­lars, but no oth­er com­put­er had the pow­er to han­dle the project of cal­cu­lat­ing the pre­cise shape of Earth as affect­ed by grav­i­ty and the nature of the oceans. About a decade lat­er, anoth­er team of gov­ern­ment sci­en­tists made use of those very same cal­cu­la­tions when putting togeth­er the mod­el employed by the World Geo­det­ic Sys­tem, which GPS satel­lites still use today. Hence the ten­den­cy of cel­e­bra­to­ry obit­u­ar­ies to under­score the point that with­out West­’s work, GPS would­n’t be pos­si­ble.\n\n\n\t\n\nNor do any of them neglect to point out the fact that West was black, one of just four such math­e­mati­cians work­ing for the Navy at Dahlgren. Sto­ries like hers have drawn much greater pub­lic inter­est since the suc­cess of Hid­den Fig­ures, the Hol­ly­wood adap­ta­tion of Mar­got Lee Shet­ter­ly’s book about the black female math­e­mati­cians at NASA dur­ing the Space Race. When that movie came out, in 2016, even West­’s own chil­dren did­n’t know the impor­tance of the once-clas­si­fied work she’d done. Only in 2018, when she pro­vid­ed that infor­ma­tion on a bio­graph­i­cal form she filled out for an event host­ed by her col­lege soror­i­ty, did it become pub­lic. She thus spent the last years of her long life as a celebri­ty, sought out by aca­d­e­mics and jour­nal­ists eager to under­stand the con­tri­bu­tions of anoth­er no-longer-hid­den fig­ure. But to their ques­tions about her own GPS use, she report­ed­ly answered that she pre­ferred a good old-fash­ioned paper map.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nMar­garet Hamil­ton, Lead Soft­ware Engi­neer of the Apol­lo Project, Stands Next to Her Code That Took Us to the Moon (1969)\nWomen’s Hid­den Con­tri­bu­tions to Mod­ern Genet­ics Get Revealed by New Study: No Longer Will They Be Buried in the Foot­notes\nMeet Grace Hop­per, the Pio­neer­ing Com­put­er Sci­en­tist Who Helped Invent COBOL and Build the His­toric Mark I Com­put­er (1906–1992)\nJoce­lyn Bell Bur­nell Dis­cov­ered Radio Pul­sars in 1974, But the Cred­it Went to Her Advi­sor; In 2018, She Gets Her Due, Win­ning a $3 Mil­lion Physics Prize\nHen­ri­et­ta Lacks Gets Immor­tal­ized in a Por­trait: It’s Now on Dis­play at the Nation­al Por­trait Gallery\nBlack His­to­ry in Two Min­utes: Watch 93 Videos Writ­ten & Nar­rat­ed by Hen­ry Louis Gates Jr.\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Creativity, Music |   \tJanuary 27th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you’ve heard Run‑D.M.C.‘s Rais­ing Hell, Rage Against the Machine’s self-titled debut, John­ny Cash’s Amer­i­can Record­ings, or Adele’s 21, you’ve heard the work of Rick Rubin. Yet even if you’ve lis­tened close­ly to every song on which he’s been cred­it­ed as a pro­duc­er over the past 45 years, you may have trou­ble pin­ning down what, exact­ly, the work of Rick Rubin is. Though his résumé includes such pro­fes­sion­al achieve­ments as co-found­ing both Def Jam Record­ings and Amer­i­can Record­ings, as well as shar­ing the pres­i­den­cy of Colum­bia Records for a stretch, he’s become best known in recent years as a kind of bare­foot sage of cre­ativ­i­ty.\n\n\n\t\n\nRubin has proven ready to dis­pense some­times-cryp­tic wis­dom in what­ev­er con­texts he finds him­self, and in the twen­ty-twen­ties, that role nat­u­ral­ly involves appear­ing on a lot of long-form inter­view pod­casts.\nFor Rubin in par­tic­u­lar, the pub­li­ca­tion of his book The Cre­ative Act: A Way of Being con­sti­tut­ed an incen­tive — or per­haps an excuse — to take a seat across from pop­u­lar pod­cast­ers like Lex Frid­man, Jay Shet­ty, and Andrew Huber­man. Nat­u­ral­ly, these con­ver­sa­tions spend a good deal of time on ques­tions of what it takes to cre­ate a work of art, great or oth­er­wise, in music or whichev­er medi­um it may be.\n\n\n\t\n\nOne of the most sur­pris­ing points to which Rubin returns again and again is that the best art is nev­er made to please an audi­ence. Instead of try­ing to antic­i­pate the tastes of oth­ers, you must first sat­is­fy your­self with your work. Think back to your first encounter with your very favorite albums, films, or books, and you’ll real­ize the truth of Rubin’s words. Even then, it must have felt like the musi­cian, the direc­tor, or the author did­n’t guess what you want­ed, but worked to cre­ate some­thing per­son­al­ly res­o­nant that went on to res­onate with you — and, per­haps, mil­lions of oth­ers as well.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe fac­tors involved in such an artis­tic con­nec­tion are many and inscrutable, in Rubin’s telling, and attempts at their expla­na­tion tend to verge on the mys­ti­cal. But they can’t be reduced to a for­mu­la that applies always and every­where, which means that cre­ators of all kinds have to go through expe­ri­ence after long expe­ri­ence of tri­al and error through­out their careers. For many, this can neces­si­tate get­ting a day job, Rubin’s advo­ca­cy of which puts him at odds with anoth­er of the most famous music producer/gurus of all time. But then, there’s more than one way to get cre­ative in this world.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nRick Rubin: The Invis­i­bil­i­ty of Hip Hop’s Great­est Pro­duc­er\nThe Beast­ie Boys & Rick Rubin Reunite and Revis­it Their For­ma­tive Time Togeth­er in 1980s NYC\nRick Rubin Revis­its the Ori­gins of Def Jam Records & the NYU Dorm Room Where It All Began\nMal­colm Glad­well and Rick Rubin Launch a New Music Pod­cast, Bro­ken Record: Lis­ten Online\nFamed New Orleans Music Pro­duc­er Mark Bing­ham Dis­cuss­es His Songs and Col­lab­o­ra­tions: A Naked­ly Exam­ined Music Con­ver­sa­tion (#136)\nThe Long Game of Cre­ativ­i­ty: If You Haven’t Cre­at­ed a Mas­ter­piece at 30, You’re Not a Fail­ure\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Ergo, it’s time for an “eco­nom­ic strike,” a “short-term coor­di­nat­ed with­draw­al from spend­ing.” He con­tin­ues: “if wealthy house­holds took their spend­ing down 10% and mid­dle class and low­er income house­holds … took it down 5%, you would take GDP neg­a­tive almost overnight.”\nBut he also gets more spe­cif­ic than that:  “If you want­ed the fastest blue line path … I believe if you could con­vince Amer­i­ca, the entire econ­o­my now is built on AI… if you could con­vince a bunch of Amer­i­cans to can­cel their Chat­G­PT or Ope­nAI accounts and all of a sud­den Ope­nAI had to announce that their sub­scrip­tions had fall­en off a cliff, that would rip­ple into Nvidia. That would rip­ple into Microsoft. And these are the peo­ple that Trump cares about.”\nHe goes on to add: “If you could fig­ure out a way to basi­cal­ly kick a small num­ber of com­pa­nies relat­ed to the tech econ­o­my that account for 40% of the S&P right now … if all of a sud­den, if you took all of your mon­ey out of any JP Mor­gan–affil­i­at­ed bank and trans­ferred it to a local region­al bank, if you can­celled all of your stream­ing media plat­forms, if you can­celled Ope­nAI and Anthrop­ic and you said “I am not upgrad­ing my Apple phone,” and there was a real move­ment that reg­is­tered and they had to dis­close it in their earn­ings calls — this would come to an end pron­to.” CEOs would stop bend­ing their knees and sud­den­ly find their voice.\nEvery dol­lar we spend—or withhold—sends a sig­nal to the mar­ket and to Trump. When enough peo­ple hold back, the pow­er of the purse can do what courts and elect­ed offi­cials can­not. Trump reversed many tar­iffs after mar­kets freaked out on ‘Lib­er­a­tion Day.’ What’s to say it wouldn’t work again?\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor Rodolfo Liprandi, nature and landscapes are sources of infinite wonder. Since childhood, growing up in northeastern Italy near the border of Slovenia, he has been awed by diverse ecologies and organic forms. “One of the aspects that most fascinated me was realizing how nature already provides ready and extremely evocative forms,” he tells Colossal. “A branch, a trunk, or a tangle of shrubs can spontaneously suggest figures, presences, animals, or movements.”\nCurrently based in Warsaw, Liprandi is drawn to forests and landscapes amid which he constructs dynamic sculptures from trimmed branches. They often adopt the likenesses of real creatures, especially woodland mammals, in addition to fantastical beings like dragons or elves. He describes his practice as a “symbiotic dialogue with the environment, free from logistical and financial constraints, where the creative process becomes central.”\n“Orso”\nLiprandi emphasizes locally sourced materials, working with what’s available around him and consciously keeping environmental impact to a minimum. The pieces are conceived as ephemeral installations, which eventually weather and decay like everything else that was once alive. He says, “What interests me is not so much the permanence of the object, but rather the process and lifecycle of the work: taking from nature, creating, and finally allowing nature to reclaim the creation.”\nThe artist’s first animal sculpture, a wild boar, continues as his most memorable work. Created for a festival about a decade ago and installed along the Soča River—called the Isonzo River in Italy—it jumpstarted his artistic career and blazed a trail he has continued along since.\n“The wild boar wasn’t just a sculpture, but a symbolic tribute to my homeland, to the Isonzo River, and to its identity—an animal that represents these places,” Liprandi says. “For me, it remains a foundational ‘totem,’ inextricably linked to the identity of the place and the birth of my artistic practice in nature.”\nExplore more on the artist’s Instagram.\n“Elogio alla Lentezza (Praise to Slowness)”\n“Zubrovtsi”\n“Mustelide (Ermine)”\nDetail of “Otter”\n“Laine”\nAlternate view of “Laine”\n“Lynx”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nChina’s medieval Tang Dynasty, which spanned 618 to 907 C.E., was something of a golden age in the nation’s long and storied history. The realm’s territory expanded while governmental stability helped to ensure relative peace, and trade routes like the Silk Road were kept relatively safe. And as people enjoyed more exposure to materials and styles from other parts of the world, the arts of this era reflected curiosity about new techniques and forms.\nThe advent of modern paper can be traced to China a little more than 2,000 years ago, so it’s fitting that a unique archaeological discovery in the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang contained some strikingly well-preserved paper artifacts. The area is also often referred to as the Valley of the Thousand Buddhas, where overland trade between China and the West via the Silk Road led to a commercial and cultural intersection.\n© The Trustees of the British Museum\nAmong the Mogao Caves’ nearly 500 surviving chambers and temples, which are filled with statuary and wall paintings spanning a millennia of Buddhist art, one particular space known as Cave 17 revealed some extraordinary objects. It was excavated in the early 1900s by an archaeologist named Marc Aurel Stein.\nSome 50,000 documents, textiles, and other objects emerged from the cavern, which had been sealed up some time during the 11th century. Among these were a series of cut and folded paper flowers, several of which are part of The Stein Textile Collection, stored at the British Museum and the V&A in London.\nLoosely based on a square format, similar to other architectural rosettes of the period, the paper flowers were likely attached to a wall or some other substrate, as they still have a dab of glue on their reverse sides. And their characteristics vary greatly, from a relatively simple painted composition to layered floral designs made with a range of paper thicknesses. \nWhile the sheer number of Buddhist artworks, relics, and environments in Dunhuang is remarkable unto itself, the existence of the delicate florets, manuscripts, paintings, and other items created with organic materials marked an incredibly rare find. And while the flowers at the British Museum are not currently on display, if you want to take a look yourself, the piece below comprising nine flowers attached to a textile backing can be viewed by appointment at the V&A’s state-of-the-art East Storehouse.\n© Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n© The Trustees of the British Museum\n© The Trustees of the British Museum\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMichael Jack­son’s Thriller is the best-sell­ing album of all time, and not by a par­tic­u­lar­ly slim mar­gin. The most recent fig­ures have it reg­is­tered at 51.3 mil­lion copies, as against the 31.2 mil­lion notched by the run­ner up, AC/DC’s Back in Black. But it would sure­ly be a clos­er call with­out the title song’s cel­e­brat­ed music video, thir­teen John Lan­dis-direct­ed min­utes full of not just singing and danc­ing, but also clas­sic-style Hol­ly­wood mon­sters, some of them doing that singing and danc­ing them­selves. Hal­loween night is, of course, the best time to revis­it Michael Jack­son’s Thriller, as it’s offi­cial­ly titled. This year, why not chase it with the behind-the-scenes doc­u­men­tary below, Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller?\nYounger fans may not know that “Thriller” was­n’t even released as a sin­gle until Novem­ber of 1983: about a year after the album itself, which had already spun off six songs, includ­ing enor­mous hits like “Bil­lie Jean” and “Beat It.” In fact, Jack­son’s unprece­dent­ed vision for the album had been that every song could be a hit, with no filler in between.\nThe high­er-ups at Epic Records felt that its pop­u­lar­i­ty, how­ev­er sen­sa­tion­al to that point, had just about run its course. That made them unwill­ing, at first, to put out “Thriller” on its own, as did the song’s campy scary-movie lyrics, sound effects, and “rap” by none oth­er than Vin­cent Price, the embod­i­ment of old-Hol­ly­wood hor­ror. (This sort of thing was­n’t with­out prece­dent: with his sib­lings, Jack­son had cre­at­ed a sim­i­lar spooky atmos­phere in “This Place Hotel,” from 1980.)\n\n\n\t\n\nStill, at that point in his rise to the kind of fame no cul­tur­al fig­ure may ever know again, Jack­son under­stood much that the old guard did­n’t. He knew that “Thriller” could suc­ceed, not just as a song on the radio, but a mul­ti­me­dia cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­non. It would, of course, need a music video, but not one that mere­ly met the (still fair­ly lax) stan­dards of MTV. Impressed by the hor­ror, com­e­dy, and visu­al effects of John Lan­dis’ An Amer­i­can Were­wolf in Lon­don, Jack­son called up Lan­dis and asked him to direct what he’d been envi­sion­ing for “Thriller” at fea­ture-film pro­duc­tion val­ues. The $500,000 bud­get came from tele­vi­sion net­works like MTV and Show­time, offi­cial­ly for broad­cast­ing rights to Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller.\nThe doc­u­men­tary cap­tures var­i­ous aspects of the video’s cre­ation, from cast­ing to chore­og­ra­phy to shoot­ing to make­up, that last being an espe­cial­ly painstak­ing process over­seen by indus­try mas­ter Rick Bak­er. What­ev­er the rig­ors of the pro­duc­tion, Jack­son dis­plays undis­guised enjoy­ment of it all in this footage, per­haps fore­see­ing that it would cul­mi­nate in the kind of expres­sion that could come from no oth­er artist. Though an intense­ly col­lab­o­ra­tive effort, Michael Jack­son’s Thriller is true to its name in ulti­mate­ly being the prod­uct of a sin­gle, guid­ing per­for­ma­tive sen­si­bil­i­ty, some­how both uni­ver­sal­ly appeal­ing and high­ly idio­syn­crat­ic at the same time. Jack­son’s insis­tence on call­ing his music videos “short films” may have been regard­ed as a typ­i­cal eccen­tric­i­ty, but nev­er was the label more appro­pri­ate than when he brought back the old-school mon­ster movie one last, funky time.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” Video Changed Pop Cul­ture For­ev­er: Revis­it the 13-Minute Short Film Direct­ed by John Lan­dis\nHear “Starlight,” Michael Jackson’s Ear­ly Demo of “Thriller”: A Ver­sion Before the Lyrics Were Rad­i­cal­ly Changed\nWhen Mar­tin Scors­ese Direct­ed Michael Jack­son in the 18-Minute “Bad” Music Video & Paid Cin­e­mat­ic Trib­ute to West Side Sto­ry (1986)\nHow Michael Jack­son Wrote a Song: A Close Look at How the King of Pop Craft­ed “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough”\nJohn Lan­dis Decon­structs Trail­ers of Great 20th Cen­tu­ry Films: Cit­i­zen Kane, Sun­set Boule­vard, 2001 & More\nWhere Zom­bies Come From: A Video Essay on the Ori­gin of the Hor­ri­fy­ing, Satir­i­cal Mon­sters\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tOctober 30th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nTo many long­time fans, there are — at the very least — two Pink Floyds. The first is the rock band that in 1965 took the name the Pink Floyd Sound, an inven­tion of its newest mem­ber Syd Bar­rett. A gui­tar-play­ing singer-song­writer, the young Bar­rett soon became the group’s guid­ing cre­ative intel­li­gence, albeit of a cracked kind. It was under his influ­ence that, two years lat­er, the Floyd released their first two hit singles,“Arnold Layne” and “See Emi­ly Play,” as well as their debut stu­dio album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This ear­ly mate­r­i­al exhibits a kind of dark­ly whim­si­cal Eng­lish eccen­tric­i­ty that turned out to fit neat­ly indeed with the psy­che­delia of the music-dri­ven late-six­ties coun­ter­cul­ture.\nThis first Pink Floyd last­ed until part­way through the pro­duc­tion of their sec­ond album, A Saucer­ful of Secrets. Up to that point, Bar­ret­t’s behav­ior had been turn­ing ever stranger and less man­age­able; even­tu­al­ly, he passed entire con­certs in a state of near cata­to­nia onstage (with the occa­sion­al spasm of a deep-seat­ed ten­den­cy to prac­ti­cal jokes).\nAfter con­sid­er­ing and find­ing unfea­si­ble the option to retain him as a non-tour­ing con­trib­u­tor, the oth­er mem­bers decid­ed sim­ply to eject him from the band. Thus began the Floy­d’s sec­ond iter­a­tion, which, despite the loss of the man who’d been writ­ing 90 per­cent of their songs, did nev­er­the­less man­age to come up with albums like Atom Heart Moth­er, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall.\nWhen Bar­rett died in 2006, after decades of life as a recluse (and, ever the Eng­lish­man, an enthu­si­as­tic gar­den­er), he was wide­ly remem­bered as a casu­al­ty of the psy­che­del­ic drug wave. But accord­ing to Roger Waters, who took the band’s reins, “LSD was not sole­ly respon­si­ble for Syd’s ill­ness.” He says so in the video above, a com­pi­la­tion of his rec­ol­lec­tions of Bar­ret­t’s decline. “It felt to me at the time that Syd was drift­ing off the rails, and when you’re drift­ing off the rails, the worst thing you could do is start mess­ing around with hal­lu­cino­gen­ics.” There was “no doubt that Syd was schiz­o­phrenic, and that he was tak­ing those drugs at the same time.” It could well have been that Bar­ret­t’s state of mind allowed him to voy­age into realms that the Floyd could oth­er­wise nev­er have accessed. But what­ev­er the causal fac­tors and their pro­por­tions, he even­tu­al­ly found him­self unable to come back home.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nPsy­che­del­ic Scenes of Pink Floyd’s Ear­ly Days with Syd Bar­rett, 1967\nUnder­stand­ing Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here, Their Trib­ute to Depart­ed Band­mate Syd Bar­rett\nShort Film “Syd Barrett’s First Trip” Reveals the Pink Floyd Founder’s Psy­che­del­ic Exper­i­men­ta­tion (1967)\nWatch David Gilmour Play the Songs of Syd Bar­rett, with the Help of David Bowie & Richard Wright\nAn Hour-Long Col­lec­tion of Live Footage Doc­u­ments the Ear­ly Days of Pink Floyd (1967–1972)\nThe Inven­tive Art­work of Pink Floyd’s Syd Bar­rett\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Literature |   \tOctober 31st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOf the many read­ings and adap­ta­tions of Edgar Allan Poe’s clas­sic moody-broody poem “The Raven,” none is more fun than The Simp­sons’, in which Lisa Simpson’s intro tran­si­tions into the read­ing voice of James Earl Jones and the slap­stick inter­jec­tions of Homer as Poe’s avatar and Bart as the tit­u­lar bird. Jones’ solo read­ing of the poem is not to be missed and exists in sev­er­al ver­sions on YouTube.\nBut Jones is not the only clas­si­cal­ly creepy actor to have mas­tered Poe’s dic­tion. Above, we have Christo­pher Walken, whose unset­tling weird­ness is always tinged with a cer­tain wry humor, per­haps an effect of his clas­si­cal New York accent.\nAccom­pa­ny­ing Walken’s read­ing are the stan­dard eerie wind sounds and the unusu­al addi­tion of some dis­tort­ed met­al gui­tar: per­haps an intru­sion, per­haps a unique dra­mat­ic effect. The visu­al com­po­nent, a mon­tage of expres­sive pen­cil draw­ings, also may or may not work for you.\n\n\n\t\n\nYou may wish to con­trast this pro­duc­tion with what may be the locus clas­si­cus for tele­vi­su­al inter­pre­ta­tions of “The Raven.” Of course I mean the ham­my Vin­cent Price read­ing (above), which lent so much aes­thet­i­cal­ly to The Simp­sons par­o­dy. One of my favorite lit­tle in-jokes in the lat­ter occurs dur­ing Bart and Lisa’s intro­duc­tion. Bart whines, “that looks like a school-book!” and Lisa replies, “don’t wor­ry, Bart. You won’t learn any­thing.”\nLisa’s rejoin­der is a sly ref­er­ence to Poe’s con­tempt for lit­er­a­ture meant to instruct or mor­al­ize, a ten­den­cy he called “the heresy of the Didac­tic.” Poe’s the­o­ry and prac­tice grew out of his desire that lit­er­a­ture have a “uni­ty of effect,” that it pro­duce an aes­thet­ic expe­ri­ence sole­ly through the author’s skill­ful use of lit­er­ary form. Poe may have antic­i­pat­ed and direct­ly influ­enced the French sym­bol­ists and oth­er aes­thetes like Oscar Wilde, but his assured place in high cul­ture has thank­ful­ly not got­ten in the way of pop appro­pri­a­tions of his more odd­ball tales, like “The Raven.” A peren­ni­al favorite read­ing of the poem is clas­sic hor­ror actor Christo­pher Lee’s (below), which may be the most straight­for­ward­ly creepy of them all.\n\n\n\t\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEdgar Allan Poe’s the Raven: Watch an Award-Win­ning Short Film That Mod­ern­izes Poe’s Clas­sic Tale\nÉdouard Manet Illus­trates Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven, in a French Edi­tion Trans­lat­ed by Stephane Mal­lar­mé (1875)\nHear Lou Reed’s The Raven, a Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe Fea­tur­ing David Bowie, Ornette Cole­man, Willem Dafoe & More\nThe Grate­ful Dead Pays Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” in a 1982 Con­cert: Hear “Raven Space”\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tOctober 30th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nApart from cer­tain stretch­es of absence, Leonar­do’s Mona Lisa has been on dis­play at the Lou­vre for 228 years and count­ing. Though cre­at­ed by an Ital­ian in Italy, the paint­ing has long since been a part of French cul­ture. At some point, the rev­er­ence for La Joconde, as the Mona Lisa is local­ly known, reached such an inten­si­ty as to inspire the label Jocondisme. For Mar­cel Duchamp, it all seems to have been a bit much. In 1919, he bought a post­card bear­ing the image of that most famous of all paint­ings, drew a mus­tache and goa­tee on it, and dubbed the result­ing “art­work” L.H.O.O.Q., whose French pro­nun­ci­a­tion “Elle a chaud au cul” trans­lates to — as Duchamp mod­est­ly put it — “There is fire down below.”\n\n\n\t\n\nA cen­tu­ry ago, this was a high­ly irrev­er­ent, even blas­phe­mous act, but also just what one might expect from the man who, a cou­ple years ear­li­er, signed a uri­nal and put it on dis­play in a gallery. Like the much-scru­ti­nized Foun­tain, L.H.O.O.Q. was one of Ducham­p’s “ready­mades,” or artis­tic provo­ca­tions exe­cut­ed by mod­i­fy­ing and re-con­tex­tu­al­iz­ing found objects.\nNei­ther was sin­gu­lar: just as Duchamp signed mul­ti­ple uri­nals, he also drew (or did­n’t draw) facial hair on mul­ti­ple Mona Lisa post­cards. In one instance, he even gave the okay to his fel­low artist Fran­cis Picabia to make one for pub­li­ca­tion in his mag­a­zine in New York as, nev­er­the­less, “par Mar­cel Duchamp” — though it lacked a goa­tee, an omis­sion the artist cor­rect­ed in his own hand some twen­ty years lat­er.\n\n\n\t\n\nIn the 1956 inter­view just above, Duchamp describes L.H.O.O.Q. as a part of his “Dada peri­od” (and, with char­ac­ter­is­tic mod­esty, “a great icon­o­clas­tic ges­ture on my part”). He also brings out a fake check — belong­ing to “no bank at all” — that he cre­at­ed to use at the den­tist (who accept­ed it); and a sys­tem designed to “break the bank at Monte Car­lo” (which stub­born­ly remained unbro­ken). “I believe that art is the only form of activ­i­ty in which man, as a man, shows him­self to be a true indi­vid­ual, and is capa­ble of going beyond the ani­mal state,” he declares. With his col­li­sion of Jocondisme and Dada, among the oth­er unlike­ly jux­ta­po­si­tions he engi­neered, he showed him­self to be the pre­mier prankster of ear­ly twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry art — and one whose pranks tran­scend­ed amuse­ment to inspire a schol­ar­ly indus­try that per­sists even today.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhat Makes the Mona Lisa a Great Paint­ing: A Deep Dive\nHow Did the Mona Lisa Become the World’s Most Famous Paint­ing?: It’s Not What You Think\nThe Mar­cel Duchamp Research Por­tal Opens, Mak­ing Avail­able 18,000 Doc­u­ments and 50,000 Images Relat­ed to the Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Artist\nHow Mar­cel Duchamp Signed a Uri­nal in 1917 & Rede­fined Art\nWhen Bri­an Eno & Oth­er Artists Peed in Mar­cel Duchamp’s Famous Uri­nal\nSal­vador Dalí Reveals the Secrets of His Trade­mark Mous­tache (1954)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCaledonia Curry’s story of the Sibylant Sisters starts like many others in the fairytale genre, although it takes just a few words to realize that something is off: “Once upon a swampy ol’ dirt road, two sisters, Caelum and Terra, were growing up under the care of a spindly little witch by the name of Katarina.” The narrative continues with the sorcerous mother beginning to unravel, prompting the siblings to rely on the younger Caelum’s magical powers to survive.\n“This story is drawn from my own childhood growing up at the end of a dirt road with a mother who was in the midst of a psychotic breakdown, and a lifetime spent teasing out the relationship between creativity, intuition, magic, and madness,” the artist says.\n\n\n\nCurry, who’s better known as Swoon (previously), has taken a sort of narrative turn in her practice as of late, translating her interest in family and intergenerational trauma into a sprawling, mythical tale. Seven years in the making, the project is multi-disciplinary and spans sculpture, installation, costume, film, and more. Many of the works can be seen in a four-part read-aloud, and they’ve also spawned an 88-card deck called “The Oracle of the Sibylants,” complete with symbolic imagery distinct to the artist’s practice.\nIncluded are renderings common in divination, including stars and smoking cauldrons, along with more idiosyncratic objects like a glowing Skee Ball machine and flailing garden hose. “Suffused with joy and tenderness amidst the hardship, these cards speak the language of fairytale, because there are some truths that can only be told by witches and unicorns, ogres and toads,” Swoon adds.\n“The Oracle of the Sibylants” is currently funding on Kickstarter, which features a video glimpsing some of the live-action and animated films to come. Stay up to date with the entire project—which Swoon envisions as a traveling exhibition, films, novella, and theatrical production—on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom feminist activist Angela Davis to iconic symbols of peace amid political upheaval, Shepard Fairey is known for his bold illustrations and instantly recognizable posters. He rose to prominence within the world of street art and skateboarding culture, creating a sticker in 1989 with the phrase “Andre the Giant has a posse,” which was distributed widely and led to a recurring motif of the wrestler’s face on dozens of subsequent prints.\nFairey’s graphic motifs hit the mainstream in 2008 during Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, in which his portrait sits above the word “hope.” The optimistic work exemplifies how grassroots activism, especially through the form of printing and sharing imagery, can become iconic and have immense influence.\n“Afrocentric (Red)” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\nOut of Print, a retrospective of Fairey’s work presented by Beyond the Streets, celebrates what the gallery calls “the rebellious, democratic force of ink and paper.” More than 400 prints designed over the past few decades are joined by new works. Many of the posters emphasize his interest in activism, empowerment, and protest. His subversive practice, known as Obey Giant, even has a slogan: “Manufacturing quality dissent since 1989.”\nFairey often incorporates the color schemes and modernist, graphic motifs of early 20th-century propaganda posters, especially of the Soviet Union. By incorporating design motifs associated with fascism into messages of peace, feminism, love, and democracy, he reinforces the power of the medium. “Some people say digital media has ended print, but the provocative, tactile experience of a print on a wall or in the wild can’t be replaced,” Fairey says. “Printing still matters!”\nThe exhibition runs from November 15 to January 11 in Los Angeles. Learn more on the gallery’s website, follow updates on Fairey’s Instagram, and purchase prints in his shop.\n“Fist” (2000), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Visual Disobedience” (2004), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“War For Sale (Red)” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“High Time for Peace” (2005), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Guns and Roses” (2006), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Mujer Fatale” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Panther Power” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

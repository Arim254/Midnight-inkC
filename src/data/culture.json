    "body": "\n\tin Art, History, Museums |   \tNovember 18th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhether or not we believe that the cards of the tarot have super­nat­ur­al pow­ers, we all think of them pri­mar­i­ly as tools for div­ina­tion. It might seem as if they’ve played that cul­tur­al role since time immemo­r­i­al, but in fact, that par­tic­u­lar use only goes back to the eigh­teenth cen­tu­ry. They were, at first, play­ing cards, used for a game known as taroc­chi in Renais­sance Italy. That was the orig­i­nal pur­pose of the old­est tarot cards in pos­ses­sion of the Vic­to­ria and Albert Muse­um, which you can see unboxed by cura­tor Ruth Hib­bard in the video above. Through­out its fif­teen min­utes, Hib­bard and two col­leagues also “unbox” five oth­er decks pro­duced across the half-mil­len­ni­um of tarot his­to­ry.\nThese include the ear­ly eigh­teenth-cen­tu­ry Minchi­ate Deck, whose name refers to a slight­ly more com­plex Flo­ren­tine card game that evolved along­side tarot. The word itself pos­si­bly orig­i­nates from the term sminchiare, “to play your high­est card” (though in Sicil­ian dialect today, it has a rather dif­fer­ent mean­ing).\nLat­er, cir­ca 1807, comes Le Petit Ora­cle des Dames, “the petite ora­cle of women,” the ear­li­est deck in the video express­ly pro­duced for car­toman­cy, or pre­dic­tion of the future through cards — albeit only as a form of light enter­tain­ment for gath­er­ings of ladies. A decade or two lat­er, out came the lux­u­ri­ous Taroc­co Soprafi­no, which bears lav­ish illus­tra­tions made with cop­per-plate engrav­ing and col­ored sten­cil­ing.\nThe V&A also has an ear­ly twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry tarot deck with rich, live­ly art cre­at­ed by the occultist Pamela Col­man-Smith, whose work has pre­vi­ous­ly been fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture. “What makes these cards so great is that they’re just so rich with mythol­o­gy and sym­bol­o­gy and mul­ti­lay­ered mean­ing,” says cura­tor Beck­ie Billing­ham, “allow­ing you to read the cards in many dif­fer­ent ways.” That’s even true of the much more the­mat­i­cal­ly delib­er­ate deck that fol­lows, an exam­ple from the ear­ly two-thou­sands that brings into our dig­i­tal cen­tu­ry the mis­sion of tarot art to “reveal clan­des­tine knowl­edge and the hid­den pow­ers at work in the world.” Com­put­ers, drones, Aldous Hux­ley, world wars, the World Wide Web: per­haps these cards let us see our future, but they cer­tain­ly give us a clear view on our present.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nMeet the For­got­ten Female Artist Behind the World’s Most Pop­u­lar Tarot Deck (1909)\nBehold the Sola-Bus­ca Tarot Deck, the Ear­li­est Com­plete Set of Tarot Cards (1490)\nCarl Jung on the Pow­er of Tarot Cards: They Pro­vide Door­ways to the Uncon­scious & Per­haps a Way to Pre­dict the Future\nSal­vador Dalí’s Tarot Cards Get Re-Issued: The Occult Meets Sur­re­al­ism in a Clas­sic Tarot Card Deck\nAle­jan­dro Jodor­owsky Explains How Tarot Cards Can Give You Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\nDivine Decks: A Visu­al His­to­ry of Tarot: The First Com­pre­hen­sive Sur­vey of Tarot Gets Pub­lished by Taschen\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPeo­ple suf­fer­ing from demen­tia lose their abil­i­ty to take an active part in con­ver­sa­tions, every­day activ­i­ties, and their own phys­i­cal upkeep.\nThey are prone to sud­den mood swings, irri­tabil­i­ty, depres­sion, and anx­i­ety.\nThey may be strick­en with delu­sions and wild hal­lu­ci­na­tions.\nAll of these things can be under­stand­ably upset­ting to friends and fam­i­lies. There’s a lot of stig­ma sur­round­ing this sit­u­a­tion.\nTak­ing care of a spouse or par­ent with demen­tia can be an over­whelm­ing­ly iso­lat­ing expe­ri­ence, though no one is more iso­lat­ed than the per­son expe­ri­enc­ing severe cog­ni­tive decline first­hand.\nWhile many of us would do any­thing to stay out of them, the sad fact is res­i­den­tial mem­o­ry care facil­i­ties are often the end-of-the-line real­i­ty for those liv­ing with extreme demen­tia.\nThe Hogeweyk, a planned vil­lage just out­side of Ams­ter­dam, offers a dif­fer­ent sort of future for those with severe demen­tia.\nThe above episode of By Design, Vox’s series about the inter­sec­tion of design and tech­nol­o­gy, explores the inno­va­tions that con­tribute to the Hogeweyk’s res­i­dents’ over­all hap­pi­ness and well­be­ing.\nRather than group­ing res­i­dents togeth­er in a sin­gle insti­tu­tion­al set­ting, they are placed in groups of six, with every­one inhab­it­ing a pri­vate room and shar­ing com­mon spaces as they see fit.\nThe com­mon spaces open onto out­door areas that can be freely enjoyed by all housed in that “neigh­bor­hood”. No need to wait until a staff mem­ber grants per­mis­sion or fin­ish­es some task.\nThose wish­ing to ven­ture fur­ther afield can avail them­selves of such pleas­ant quo­tid­i­an des­ti­na­tions as a gro­cery, a restau­rant, a bar­ber­shop, or a the­ater.\nThese loca­tions are designed in accor­dance with cer­tain things proven to work well in insti­tu­tion­al set­tings —  for instance, avoid­ing dark floor tiles, which some peo­ple with demen­tia per­ceive as holes.\nBut oth­er design ele­ments reflect the choice to err on the side of qual­i­ty of life. Hand rails may help in pre­vent­ing falls, but so do rol­la­tors and walk­ers, which the res­i­dents use on their jaunts to the town squares, gar­dens and pub­lic ameni­ties.\nThe design­ers believe that equip­ping res­i­dents with a high lev­el of free­dom not only pro­motes phys­i­cal activ­i­ty, it min­i­mizes issues asso­ci­at­ed with demen­tia like aggres­sion, con­fu­sion, and wan­der­ing.\nCo-founders Eloy van Hal and Jan­nette Spier­ing write that the Hogeweyk’s crit­ics com­pare it to the Tru­man Show, the 1998 film in which Jim Car­rey’s title char­ac­ter real­izes that his whole­some small town life, and his every inter­ac­tion with his pur­port­ed friends, neigh­bors, and loved ones, have been a set up for a high­ly rat­ed, hid­den cam­era real­i­ty TV show.\nThey describe The Hogeweyk as a stage for, “the rem­i­nis­cence world”, in which actors help the res­i­dents live in a fic­ti­tious world. Many Alzheimer’s experts have, how­ev­er, val­ued The Hogeweyk for what it real­ly is: a famil­iar and safe envi­ron­ment in which peo­ple with demen­tia live while retain­ing their own iden­ti­ty and auton­o­my as much as pos­si­ble. They live in a social com­mu­ni­ty with real streets and squares, a real restau­rant with real cus­tomers, a super­mar­ket for gro­ceries and a the­atre that hosts real per­for­mances. There is no fake bus stop or post office, there are no fake façades and sets. The restau­rant employ­ee, the handy­man, the care­tak­er, the nurse, the hair­dress­er, etc.—in short: every­one who works at The Hogeweyk uses their pro­fes­sion­al skills to actu­al­ly sup­port the res­i­dents and are, there­fore, cer­tain­ly not actors.\nPro­fes­sion­al care and sup­port goes on around the clock, but rarely takes cen­ter­stage. Nor­mal life is pri­or­i­tized.\nA vis­i­tor describes a stroll through some of the Hogeweyk’s pub­lic areas:\n\nIn the shade of one of the large trees, a mar­ried cou­ple gazes hap­pi­ly at the activ­i­ty in the the­atre square. An elder­ly gen­tle­man, togeth­er with a young lady, intent­ly study the large chess board and take turns mov­ing the pieces. At the foun­tain, a group of women chat loud­ly on colour­ful gar­den chairs. The sto­ry is clear­ly audible—it is about a mem­o­ry of a vis­it to a park in Paris which had the same chairs. Passers-by, old and young, greet the women enthu­si­as­ti­cal­ly. A lit­tle fur­ther on, a woman is talk­ing to a man oppo­site her. She is ges­tur­ing wild­ly. After a while, anoth­er woman joins the con­ver­sa­tion. The two women then walk through the open front door of Boule­vard 15. \nThe cov­ered pas­sage smells of fresh­ly-baked cook­ies. The scent is com­ing from De Bonte Hof. Amus­ing con­ver­sa­tions can be heard that pause for a moment when the oven beeps in the kitchen that has been dec­o­rat­ed in an old-fash­ioned style. A tray of fresh cook­ies is removed from the oven. Two women, one in a wheel­chair, enter the venue, obvi­ous­ly seduced by the smell. They sam­ple the cook­ies. \nThe super­mar­ket across the street is very busy. Shop­ping trol­leys loaded with gro­ceries are pushed out of the shop. The rat­tle of a shop­ping trol­ley dis­si­pates into the dis­tance as it dis­ap­pears from view towards Grote Plein. A man reluc­tant­ly push­es the full trol­ley while two women fol­low behind him arm in arm. The trio dis­ap­pear behind the front door of Grote Plein 5.\n\nA staffer’s account of a typ­i­cal morn­ing in one of Hogeweyk’s hous­es reveals more about the hands-on care that allows res­i­dents to con­tin­ue enjoy­ing their care­ful­ly designed home, and the autonomous lifestyle it makes pos­si­ble:\nMr Hen­dricks wakes up on the sofa. He unzips his fly. I jump up and escort him to the toi­let just in time. I grab a roll of med­ica­tion for him from the med­ica­tion trol­ley. He is now walk­ing to his room. We pick out clothes togeth­er and I lay them out on his bed. He wash­es him­self at the sink. I watch briefly before leav­ing. Fif­teen min­utes lat­er, I poke my head through the door. That’s not how elec­tric shav­ing works! I offer to help, but Mr. Hen­dricks is clear­ly a bit irri­tat­ed and grum­bles. He’ll be a lit­tle less shaven today. We’ll try again after break­fast…\nWe help Mrs Sti­j­nen into the show­er chair with the hoist. She is clear­ly not used to it. Dis­cussing her exten­sive Swarovs­ki col­lec­tion, dis­played in the glass case in her room, turns out to be an excel­lent dis­trac­tion. She proud­ly talks about the lat­est piece she acquired this year. On to the show­er. The two oth­er res­i­dents are still sleep­ing. Great, that gives me the chance to devote some extra time to Mrs Sti­j­nen today. \nThe door­bell rings again and my col­league, Yas­min, walks in. She’s the famil­iar face that every­one can rely on. Always present at 8 a.m., 5 days a week. What a relief for res­i­dents and fam­i­ly. She, too, puts her coat and bag in the lock­er. The wash­ing machine is ready, and Yas­min loads up the dry­er. The table in the din­ing room is then set. Yas­min puts a flo­ral table­cloth from the cup­board on the table. Mr Hen­dricks lends a hand and, with some guid­ance, puts two plates in their place, but then walks away to the sofa and sits down. A Dutch break­fast with bread, cheese, cold cuts, jam, cof­fee, tea and milk is served. Yas­min is mak­ing por­ridge for Mrs Smit. As always, she has break­fast in bed. Yas­min helps Mrs Smit. It is now 08:45 and Mr Hen­dricks and Mrs Sti­j­nen are sit­ting at the din­ing table. Yas­min push­es the chairs in and sits down her­self. They chat about the weath­er, and Yas­min lends a help­ing hand when need­ed. \nMr Hen­dricks is real­ly grumpy today and is cur­rent­ly grum­bling at Mrs Jansen. I’m won­der­ing if we’re over­look­ing some­thing?\n\n\n\t\n\nLearn more about the Hogeweyk, the world’s first demen­tia vil­lage here.\nWatch a playlist of Vox By Design episodes here.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nThe Restau­rant of Mis­tak­en Orders: A Tokyo Restau­rant Where All the Servers Are Peo­ple Liv­ing with Demen­tia\nHow Music Can Awak­en Patients with Alzheimer’s and Demen­tia\nDemen­tia Patients Find Some Eter­nal Youth in the Sounds of AC/DC\n- Ayun Hal­l­i­day is the Chief Pri­ma­tol­o­gist in NYC.\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tNovember 19th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf pressed to pick the most inter­na­tion­al art fig­ure of the past dozen years, one could do much worse than the Swedish artist-mys­tic Hilma af Klint, despite her hav­ing been dead for more than 80 years now. As evi­denced by the links at the bot­tom of the post, we’ve been fea­tur­ing her here on Open Cul­ture since 2017, first in the con­text of whether she counts as the first abstract painter. Just a few years before that, prac­ti­cal­ly no one in the world had ever heard her name, let alone beheld any of her more than 1,200 paint­ings and draw­ings. In fact, it was only in 2013, with the show Hilma af Klint — A Pio­neer of Abstrac­tion at Stock­holm’s Mod­er­na Museet, that she first became pub­licly known.\nFrom there, her can­on­iza­tion pro­ceed­ed rapid­ly. One uses that word advis­ed­ly, giv­en af Klin­t’s reli­gios­i­ty, whose inten­si­ty, eso­teri­cism, and rig­or con­sti­tute one of the themes of Alice Gre­go­ry’s recent New York­er piece on the artist’s work, lega­cy, and rel­a­tive­ly new­found pop­u­lar­i­ty, all of it col­ored by the fact that none of her pieces have ever been for sale.\nThe uncan­ni­ly mod­ern, before-its-time aes­thet­ic appeal of af Klin­t’s work is one thing; the dearth of wide­spread knowl­edge about the details of her life and thought, which has allowed many of her sud­den­ly avid twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry fans to imag­ine her into their pre­ferred artis­tic, philo­soph­i­cal, and social nar­ra­tives, is anoth­er. Yet key to the fas­ci­na­tion of her images is that, hav­ing been born in 1862, she was­n’t a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry woman.\n\n\n\t\n\nAf Klint bare­ly even belonged to the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, or indeed to any world­ly time peri­od at all. The com­plex and seem­ing­ly con­tra­dic­to­ry world­view that inspired her art­work is prac­ti­cal­ly inac­ces­si­ble to us, even if we man­age to get through the 26,000 jour­nal pages she left behind. Gre­go­ry inter­views one such (and per­haps the only) ded­i­cat­ed indi­vid­ual, a non­prof­it CEO and af Klint schol­ar ded­i­cat­ed to explod­ing the myths that have so read­i­ly accret­ed around her. One is that she worked alone: evi­dence sug­gests that some paint­ings attrib­uted to her may actu­al­ly have been exe­cut­ed by oth­er mem­bers of her spir­i­tu­al­ist cir­cle, The Five. But even if she turns out not to have been a move­ment of one after all, her name will no doubt con­tin­ue to sell out muse­um exhi­bi­tions for years to come.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nDis­cov­er Hilma af Klint: Pio­neer­ing Mys­ti­cal Painter and Per­haps the First Abstract Artist\nThe Life & Art of Hilma Af Klint: A Short Art His­to­ry Les­son on the Pio­neer­ing Abstract Artist\nNew Hilma af Klint Doc­u­men­tary Explores the Life & Art of the Trail­blaz­ing Abstract Artist\nA Short Video Intro­duc­tion to Hilma af Klint, the Mys­ti­cal Female Painter Who Helped Invent Abstract Art\nThe Com­plete Works of Hilma af Klint Get Pub­lished for the First Time in a Beau­ti­ful, Sev­en-Vol­ume Col­lec­tion\nWho Paint­ed the First Abstract Paint­ing?: Wass­i­ly Kandin­sky?

    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tNovember 19th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen wood­cut artist Kat­sushi­ka Hoku­sai made his famous print The Great Wave off Kana­gawa in 1830 — part of the series Thir­ty-six Views of Mount Fuji — he was 70 years old and had lived his entire life in a Japan closed off from the rest of the world. In the 19th cen­tu­ry, how­ev­er, “the rest of the world was becom­ing indus­tri­al­ized,” James Payne explains above in his Great Art Explained video, “and the Japan­ese were con­cerned about for­eign inva­sions.” The Great Wave shows “an image of Japan fear­ful that the sea — which has pro­tect­ed its peace­ful iso­la­tion for so long — would become its down­fall.”\nIt’s also true, how­ev­er, that The Great Wave would not have exist­ed with­out a for­eign inva­sion. Pruss­ian blue, the first sta­ble blue pig­ment, acci­den­tal­ly invent­ed around 1705 in Berlin, arrived in the ports of Nagasa­ki on Dutch and Chi­nese ships in the 1820s. Pruss­ian Blue would start a new artis­tic move­ment in Japan, aizuri‑e, wood­cuts print­ed in bright, vivid blues.\n“Hoku­sai was one of the first Japan­ese print­mak­ers to bold­ly embrace the colour,” Hugh Davies writes at The Con­ver­sa­tion, “a deci­sion that would have major impli­ca­tions in the world of art.” When the country’s iso­la­tion­ist poli­cies end­ed in the 1850s, “a show­case at the inau­gur­al Japan­ese Pavil­ion ele­vat­ed the artis­tic sta­tus of wood­block prints and a craze for their col­lec­tion quick­ly fol­lowed.”\n\nChief among the works col­lect­ed in the Euro­pean and Amer­i­can fer­vor for Japan­ese prints were those from Hoku­sai, his con­tem­po­rary Hiroshige, and oth­er aizuri‑e artists. So famous was The Great Wave in the West by 1891 that French graph­ic artist Pierre Bon­nard would sat­i­rize its styl­ish spray in an adver­tise­ment for cham­pagne. A print of The Great Wave hung on Claude Debussy’s wall, and the first edi­tion of his La Mer bore an adap­ta­tion of a detail from the print. As Michael Cirigliano writes for the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Muse­um of Art:\nCul­tur­al cir­cles through­out Europe great­ly admired Hoku­sai’s work…. Major artists of the Impres­sion­ist move­ment such as Mon­et owned copies of Hoku­sai prints, and lead­ing art crit­ic Philippe Bur­ty, in his 1866 Chefs-d’oeu­vre des Arts indus­triels, even stat­ed that Hoku­sai’s work main­tained the ele­gance of Wat­teau, the fan­ta­sy of Goya, and the move­ment of Delacroix. Going one step fur­ther in his laud­ed com­par­isons, Bur­ty wrote that Hoku­sai’s dex­ter­i­ty in brush strokes was com­pa­ra­ble only to that of Rubens.\nThese com­par­isons are not mis­placed, John-Paul Stonard explains in The Guardian: “That the Great Wave became the best known print in the west was in large part due to Hokusai’s for­ma­tive expe­ri­ence of Euro­pean art.” Not only did he absorb Pruss­ian blue into his reper­toire, but “prints from ear­ly in his career show him attempt­ing, rather awk­ward­ly, to apply the les­son of math­e­mat­i­cal per­spec­tive, learnt from Euro­pean prints brought into Japan by Dutch Traders.” By the time of The Great Wave, he had per­fect­ed his own syn­the­sis of West­ern and Japan­ese art, over two decades before Euro­pean painters would attempt the same in the explo­sion of Japanophil­ia of the late 19th and ear­ly 20th cen­turies.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2021.\nRelat­ed Con­tent: \nView 103 Dis­cov­ered Draw­ings by Famed Japan­ese Wood­cut Artist Kat­sushi­ka Hoku­sai\nGet Free Draw­ing Lessons from Kat­sushi­ka Hoku­sai, Who Famous­ly Paint­ed The Great Wave of Kana­gawa: Read His How-To Book, Quick Lessons in Sim­pli­fied Draw­ings\nHokusai’s Action-Packed Illus­tra­tions of Japan­ese & Chi­nese War­riors (1836)\nA Col­lec­tion of Hokusai’s Draw­ings Are Being Carved Onto Wood­blocks & Print­ed for the First Time Ever\nThe Evo­lu­tion of Hokusai’s Great Wave: A Study of 113 Known Copies of the Icon­ic Wood­block Print\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThrough dense thickets of florals rendered in watercolor and colored pencil, a woman attempts to find her footing. Enmeshed in vines and leaves, this nude protagonist can be seen cradling a child or tending to another matter, her surroundings obscuring the particulars of her body and actions.\nThese vibrant works are part of a semi-autobiographical series by Sarah Ann Weber, who marks two momentous occasions: the birth of her daughter and her move from Los Angeles, where she lived for a decade, to her hometown of Chicago. Titled I Know Her, this body of work refers to the artist herself, her child, and the stark differences between the two landscapes. \n“Wake up bright” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper mounted to linen over panel, 36 x 48 inches\nWeber explores these significant changes through works teeming with growth. Whereas Los Angeles is dry and warm much of the year, Chicago cycles through all four seasons, sometimes seemingly within the same week. Contrasts between these locales arise through bright, tropical palettes alongside muted, winter fields in shades of gray and blue.\nWithin these lush atmospheres, splotches of watercolor and vivid florals subsume any definitive boundaries. Drawing on the traditions of window paintings and portraits depicting mother and child, the artist nests architectural structures and tender, familial moments within her largely botanical scenes. All seem to acquiesce to the rapidly evolving environment, nodding to the inevitability of change and renewal inside and out.\nI Know Her runs through January 10 at Anat Ebgi Gallery in Los Angeles. Find more from Weber on her website and Instagram.\n“My crocus in a hidden garden” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper, framed 24.75 x 32.75 inches\n“Apple blossom” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper, framed, 24.75 x 32.75 inches\n“The era of small pleasures” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper, framed, 32.75 x 24.75 inches\n“Night Blooming Jasmine” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper, framed, 41 x 53 inches\n“A tree you come home to” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper, framed, 41 x 53 inches\n“Star up my sleeve” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper mounted to linen over panel, 72 x 36 inches\n“Keeps climbing higher” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper mounted to linen over panel, 48 x 36 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom dozens of painted mesh fabric panels, Tomislav Topić’s undulating, site-specific installations transform airy spaces into immersive experiences. Superimposed in layers that are meticulously suspended from the ceiling or between outdoor structures, the panels interact with sunlight and one another to create vibrant gradients.\nOne of Topić’s most recent interventions, Echoverse, consists of 57 different colors on 451 panels, stretching nearly 100 feet long and about 25 feet wide. It’s currently installed in a spacious former chapel home to Les 3 CHA, an art center in Châteaugiron, France, where the work flutters wave-like through the open space.\nDetail of “Echoverse”\nAdditional recent pieces include “Nexus Lucis,” which centered above the altar of a large church in Gisors, France, earlier this year. And new this fall, an outdoor installation titled “Afterburn” floats above Intendencia Street in downtown Pensacola, Florida.\nGeometry, hue, and light interact to create prismatic interactions. “Every color, every layer, every viewpoint responds to another—like lines of a poem extending one another, or like sound waves traveling through the space and refracting in the air,” Topić says in a statement. Hovering independently yet arranged with precision, the perceived effect evolves as one walks around the work. From one vantage point, the installation may appear more opaque, but from another, its faceted and translucent nature is revealed.\nTopić carefully considers the nature of spaces, how we interact within them, and how shifting light throughout the day changes how they feel. “It is important to me to create a work that introduces a deliberate contrast, yet still merges with the space,” he says. “I love this symbiosis; for me, it is essential—especially in a place that carries more than 800 years of history.”\nEchoverse continues through December 14.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDubbed “purgatory for artists,”  Quarantine is dedicated to finding freedom through constraint. The intensive residency program takes its name from its venue: an 18th-century lazaretto off the coast of Menorca, Spain.\nBuilt between 1793 and 1807, the fortress in the port of Mahón was a prison for sanitation, at which travelers would dock and be quarantined for a few weeks or until they recovered from disease. The facility closed about a century later, although the Gothic architecture and cemeteries that were once fundamental to its operations remain. Today, the secluded island is typically utilized as a tourist destination, event space, and the home of a mysterious residency.\n\nConceived in 2017 by artist Carles Gomila, the residency program has always been experimental and emerged in various iterations before debuting in its current form in 2023 with partners Joan Taltavull, Itziar Lecea, and Darren Green. Gomila is steadfast in his commitment to the ethos of Quarantine. Each spring and fall, he and his team invite about 60 people to the island, where they spend the week immersed in a rigorous program. The particulars of each edition are kept secret, and no phones are allowed.\nThis untethering allows a special kind of focus and a sense of communal vulnerability as everything that happens on the island, really does stay on the island (residents even have the opportunity to burn their work at the end of the week). The intention, the curators say, is to push artists to find their purpose, a task they undertake through a carefully crafted schedule. Gomila is quick to make the distinction that Quarantine should not be thought of as a retreat but rather a training program, one that asks participants to stretch beyond their typical limits.\nResidents rotate between art labs and sessions with a slate of high-profile mentors—this upcoming edition includes artists we’ve featured on Colossal, Yuko Shimizu and Martin Wittfooth—with a variety of programming in the evening. The specifics of the art lab activities are always evolving, allowing for surprise and novelty with each day and each edition. Contrast is key, Gomila says, as is risk. Although the structure of the program remains consistent, fewer than half of the activities and particular prompts are repeated. “I found that the more risky, the better it works,” Gomila adds. “This is quite an incentive to change things every edition.”\nBecause the program isn’t prescriptive or focused on perfecting techniques or introducing theory, it functions as an inverse of the typical courses you’d find in an art school. The labs take cues from “art, education, psychology, and strategy,” Gomila says. “I believe technique is extremely important, but we need to build something that complements it.” Instead, Quarantine focuses on mindset. “We push you to confront your fears, unlearn what’s restraining you, and rediscover the fire that makes you create,” a statement on its website says.\n\nWhile the program is focused largely on making visual works, it attracts people who might not identify first as artists. Lawyers, psychiatrists, and even a rescue dog trainer work alongside designers, art directors, and concept designers.\nThe theme of the upcoming edition is Tears in the Rain, a reference to the iconic monologue from Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. Detaching oneself from the work is a central intention, and like all of Quarantine’s editions, part of the philosophy its creators hope to foster.\nColossal will attend this spring’s program, from April 13 to 19, 2026. Find out more about joining us and the application process on Quarantine’s website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

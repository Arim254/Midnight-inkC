In a well-lit performance, Christian worship painter Vanessa Horabuena began the portrait with a bright-yellow cross and ambidextrous brush strokes as a cover of “Hallelujah” and other religious music played in the background.“There’s a young lady named Vanessa who’s one of the greatest artists anywhere in the world,” Trump reportedly told the audience. “She can paint, slowly, a beautiful portrait for the White House, or she can paint the most incredible painting in literally 10 minutes.” It is unclear what he was referring to regarding a White House portrait, but Trump replaced a depiction of President Barack Obama with a painting portraying his assassination attempt last year. At the time, Trump had not announced the name of the artist who created the replacement portrait. The president, during the New Year’s Eve performance, went on to say the artist “has done portraits” of him in the White House, and that he had “replaced a lot of people with those portraits.” The final product was a fair-skinned, light-eyed figure resembling an AI-generated rendition of the Shroud of Turin, which Trump described as “amazing.” “If I wanted a portrait I would call Vanessa,” Trump remarked to his wealthy audience.Before the bidding commenced, Trump called out to his sons, Donald and Eric, to name their favorite charities, reportedly announcing that the proceeds of the sale would go to the sheriff’s department and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Trump did not specify the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department, which has assisted the Secret Service in the president’s security. The final bid of just under $3 million came from an unnamed couple, a drastic price increase from the $15,000–$40,000 Horabuena usually sells her devotional works for.Also on New Year’s Eve, the White House projected the number \"250\" and red, white and blue shapes onto the Washington Monument to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. Similar projections will be shown nightly through January 5. The White House has repeatedly referenced the country’s 250th birthday in communications with the Smithsonian in its attempts to alter the telling of history in its exhibitions this year. In some ways, auctioning off a painting of Jesus for millions of dollars is perfectly in line with Trump’s penchant for leaning on religion when it suits him. Some religious commentators and figures have rejected Trump’s policies and actions, including mass deportations, as opposed to Christian values.Hyperallergic has reached out to Horabuena for comment. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Look, I know New Year’s resolutions are a cliché, but I want to share mine with you: This year, I’m going to finish my thesis. I completed coursework for my master’s degree in Art History years ago and wrote about half of my thesis before letting other projects, and plain old exhaustion, push it down the priority list. This made me feel guilty, and the guilt became another deterrent. Every time I sat down to write, a sense of shame loomed over the work ahead like a slowly expanding ink blot. Any writer or artist will know this feeling quite well. Yet we find a way to keep going.This week, Hyperallergic’s reporters and contributors authored pieces that spoke to resilience and momentum, like critic Seph Rodney’s moving review of a Hew Locke exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art. In Locke’s suspended sculptures of vessels, loaded with cargo as though “plucked from the sea mid-journey,” Rodney sees how vestiges of the past carry into the present. The show, he writes, “is about transitions, movement, both to and from what we might recognize as our home shores.”We also looked back at a legacy and found insights for the future. Spanish artist Cecilia Giménez, who died this week at 94, left not just the world’s most beloved botched restoration, but also the remarkable lesson that what might seem like a mistake could turn into your life’s most beautiful surprise. That’s a bit of wisdom we can all lean into — including us thesis writers …And on we go. Thank you as always for reading. — Valentina Di Liscia, senior editor\nNewsPiet Mondrian, “Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow” (1930) (photo via Wikimedia Commons)Dozens of works of art, film, literature, and music entered the public domain on January 1, including a historic painting by Piet Mondrian and Betty Boop's debut appearance.

Much ink has been spilled over Wojnarowicz’s work as a visual and performance artist, writer, and, of course, queer activist during the AIDS epidemic. But the Leslie-Lohman Museum’s new catalog, corresponding to its exhibition focusing on Wojnarowicz’s nearly 500-photograph Arthur Rimbaud in New York project, takes on particular resonance today, in an age of growing authoritarianism. Earlier this fall, federal immigration agents — masked to avoid identification — stormed Lower Manhattan in an unexpected raid, not too far from the museum. In the past few years, a whole fashion aesthetic dubbed stealth wear has sprung up, designed to resist government and corporate surveillance, including the constant presence of CCTV cameras.Rimbaud died in 1891. Unexpectedly, years later, the New York Downtown arts scene and discontented youth elsewhere rediscovered Rimbaud’s transgressive poetry and held him up as a luminary of sorts; at one point, writer and artist Dennis Cooper even held a Rimbaud “live-alike” contest. Beyond Rimbaud’s writings, Wojnarowicz likely saw himself in Rimbaud’s life, too — both men were young, queer runaways. But as critic Craig Dworkin writes in his contribution to the catalog, “On the Riverbank,” Wojnarowicz’s use of Rimbaud as a symbol was broad and uncompromising in its sweep — a protest “not just against the corporation or the state, but against the state of the world.” David Wojnarowicz, \"Arthur Rimbaud in New York (Times Square)\" (1978–79), silver printAntonio Sergio Bessa, who also curated the show, writes in his contribution to the catalog that Wojnarowicz transforms “the figure of Rimbaud into a mask of youth which anyone can identify with.” In doing so, Wojnarowicz “removed himself from the picture, so to speak, thus allowing the viewer to merge with the subject.” The current political climate asks us to take that contradiction — and Bessa’s thesis about self-removal — even further. Wojnarowicz, and anyone who cares to resist problematic power structures, should seriously consider removing themselves as a form of resistance. Certainly, the most direct way to remove one’s likeness from the surveillance state is to literally mask, maybe to pick up some stealth wear. But removal as political resistance goes beyond that. It calls for a refusal to engage in situations that take up time and energy better used elsewhere. As artists like Jenny Odell have written, doing “nothing” is a way of resisting oppressive forces, too. It calls for creativity.In her essay “Our Rimbaud Mask,” writer Anna Vitale notes elliptically that “Wojnarowicz’s Rimbaud both represents and reflects while also sabotaging reflection.” Indeed, Wojnarowicz’s use of Rimbaud reflects his specific time period and represents what artists from that era stood for — among other things, expanding formal boundaries and pushing for LGBTQ+ rights. But Wojnarowicz’s use of a mask also sabotages reflection. As Bessa writes, it “merges” the viewer and the subject. By reflecting and obscuring at once, Wojnarowicz reminds us how, in a world where governmental and corporate surveillance often blur into one another, we have to be innovative and unexpected in our resistance. This might look like traditional protesting, or preventing ICE raids before they begin, or continuing to make art in the face of institutional violence. Whichever ways we choose to resist, I think Wojnarowicz and Rimbaud would approve. David Wojnarowicz, \"Rimbaud in New York (diner)\" (1978–79), silver printDavid Wojnarowicz: Arthur Rimbaud in New York (2025), edited by Antonio Sergio Bessa, is available for purchase online and in bookstores.

The bows of “The Survivor” (2022), “The Relic” (2022), and “Desire” (2018) all point in the same direction, and all are loaded with cargo, as if they were plucked from the sea mid-journey and shrunken down to fit inside this gallery. They sway slightly on their strings, as though still remembering the rhythm of the water. They are freighted with jute sacks that have rope choking their midsections, potted plants, tied herbal sprigs dangling over the sides, wooden crates marked “fragile,” fishing nets, and other sacks that contain unrevealed supplies. Only two ships have sails, and those are no more than tattered and torn remnants. Though the hulls of “The Relic” and “The Survivor” were recently painted, most of the vessels’ parts look rusted, corroded, stained, battered by wind and briny water. Still, they resemble models of vessels that could preserve human life. “The Relic” has a two-room bungalow on stilts that’s replete with a staircase, a porch, tilting window shutters, and a corrugated metal roof in wild disrepair. The brochure for Passages, Hew Locke's survey exhibition, indicates that this structure is a replica of a British colonial plantation house. If this work is meant to convey the artist’s experience as a Guyanese expatriate who has witnessed that nation coming into independence, why take this house with you? And why make a house that’s designed to dwell on water?Installation view of Hew Locke: Passages at the Yale Center for British Art. Left: \"The Survivor\" (2022); right: \"The Relic\" (2022) (photo Seph Rodney/Hyperallergic)Locke is known for making art that deals incisively and repetitively with the legacies of empire, with its symbols of political, social, legal, and economic power, with the ramifications of nation building to combat the privations of world superpowers. The key code word used to corral all this historical complexity is “colonialism” or “postcolonialism.” I could use the rest of this review to plumb the depths of Locke’s valorous aesthetic and intellectual struggle against a tarnishing and rusting inheritance. But the boats ask me to pose different questions since they seem to carry the artist’s own belongings. Though he was born in Scotland, Locke’s family originated in Guyana, known as the “land of many waters.” He traveled there by boat, arriving in 1966, and later returned to Scotland via the same means. While in Guyana as a young child he witnessed the colony fight for and declare its independence from Britain. After returning to Britain in 1980, he settled in London. Installation view of \"Souvenir 6 (Princess Alexandra)\" (2019), mixed media on antique Parian ware, in Hew Locke: Passages at the Yale Center for British Art (photo Seph Rodney/Hyperallergic)The ships' names indicate that they are meant to meld a desire to travel, to be in constant motion, with the drive to survive. But the motion of these ships is simultaneously forward and backward. They bring the past with them in the housing forms they carry, in the sails of “The Survivor” that have images of sugarcane being cut and harvested. There are labor practices, social hierarchies, kinds of punitive violence that repeat in the present (think of the January 6 insurrection) precisely because in our movement toward a postcolonial reality, we hold onto certain habits. And what else might they bring that I cannot yet perceive, because that cargo is hidden in the holds? Survival cuts in several ways: When we survive, so too do our ghosts and our wounds. More than any other feeling, what occurs to me seeing these vessels is a sense of our precarity, precisely because what I already know about the legacy of colonialism is daunting enough and I am not aware of all the things it makes us — the children of independence fervor and colonial powers — carry. Beyond the ships, the rest of the show is visually arresting, evoking Locke’s rendering of empire’s signs of authority in his own pidgin language. “Hinterland” (2013) depicts a statue of Queen Victoria that was unveiled in the capital, Georgetown, in 1894, and later banished to a botanical garden during Guyana’s surge toward independence. Surrounding the former queen (whose nose and left arm are missing, excised during the uprisings) are mostly skeletal figures, drawn in outline, who play drums, trumpets, a flute, and banjo as if providing ghoulish musical accompaniment for a macabre dance that is both a celebration and mourning ceremony. The former British monarch, overlaid here with a patterned patina of green and red, looks ghoulish herself, which befits the machinations of a kingdom that managed its colonies through violence.Installation view of Hew Locke: Passages at the Yale Center for British Art. Foreground: \"Jumbie House 1\" (2019) (photo Seph Rodney/Hyperallergic)The exhibition also includes charcoal drawings portraying the ghostly effigies of monarchy against a backdrop of native Guyanese architecture; prints, with acrylic paint applied, that represent former plantation houses placed on the hulls of boats; and shrunken versions of the actual residences rendered in wood and metal and presented on platforms. The most beautiful works in the show are those within the three series How Do You Want Me, Natives and Colonials, and Ambassadors. The first set are chromogenic prints that portray Locke in elaborate, maximalist disguise with all sorts of dime-store regalia covering him, as if to make him into his own version of an emperor. Look at “Congo Man” from 2007. It’s a mashup of a soldier holding a long gun, with all manner of bladed weaponry on the floor radiating outward from his feet, but he is festooned with flowers, suggesting the warrior grew from the ground. The statues of Natives and Colonials present the artist intervening in public monuments, remaking them in acrylic paint applied to prints so that they become strange stalkers of the urban landscape, not quite demons, not quite demigods, but something closer to eldritch creatures who no longer belong in our world. This is what “Churchill” (2016) looks like, his towering, resolute figure covered in blue paint with prominent yellow stars. Locke transforms Winston Churchill into a figure who might have arrived on earth from some alien address.Hew Locke, \"Veni, Vidi, Vici (The Queen’s Coat of Arms)\" (2004), textile, plastic, oil stick, artificial hair, and plywood (photo Seph Rodney/Hyperallergic)Ambassadors are the show’s most terrifying and beguiling works. They consist of warrior figures astride horses, both extravagantly decorated with fabric tatters, medals, bygone currency, skulls, revolvers, and plastic faux gold chains, pearls, and flowers. The figure in “Ambassador 4” (2022), clad in black from head to the horse’s hooves, wears a huge headdress decorated with skeletons who play the same melancholy tune as they do in other works in Passages. She doesn’t seem to represent the end times, but rather the beginning of a future that is dark only because it is shrouded. Passages is an apt name for the exhibition. The collected work is about transitions, movement, both to and from what we might recognize as our home shores. I can’t tell for sure, but I suspect that part of what Locke is divulging is the secret that we sometimes need to get into a conceptual or material vehicle that can convey us away from our points of origin. If we stay on that transport long enough, we come back to where we started, unless we reach for something beyond this earth, sea, and sky.Detail of \"The Relic\" and \"The Survivor\" in Hew Locke: Passages at the Yale Center for British Art (photo Seph Rodney/Hyperallergic)Hew Locke, \"Hinterland\" (2013), acrylic on chromogenic print (photo Seph Rodney/Hyperallergic)Hew Locke, \"Wine Dark Sea BB\" (2016), wood and mixed media with embroidered textile (photo Seph Rodney/Hyperallergic)Hew Locke, \"Koh-i-noor\" (2005), mixed media on wood base (© Hew Locke, Brooklyn Museum; image courtesy Brooklyn Museum)Hew Locke: Passages continues at the Yale Center for British Art (1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, Connecticut) through January 11.

    "body": "\n            Believe it or not, the future of our nation may rest on how museums in the United States perform in 2026. We must deliver content about the 250th anniversary of our nation and its democracy that is thoughtful and comprehensive. We must make access to museums within reach of all Americans. And finally, museums must issue a challenge to the communities we serve: It’s time to know your nation’s history, if for no other reason than that it is our only path to building a more perfect union.It’s tempting to be dispirited as a museum professional these days. Headlines about a highly partisan political environment, a cynical public, and a tidal wave of industrial and cultural change driven by AI might lead one to think that museums have been relegated to the sidelines of our nation’s future.   Yet museums are among the most trusted institutions in our nation, scoring well above the government, the media, and non-governmental organizations on perceived credibility, trustworthiness, and not having a political agenda.At The New York Historical, as part of our programming to mark the 250th, we commissioned a poll to better understand how museums can leverage the trust they inspire to address the national frustration. There was much to cover — and we focused on asking Americans how they are feeling about the upcoming birthday of their nation and its democracy, as opposed to what they think of museums or what would most attract attention. Administered by Lincoln Park Strategies, it surveyed more than 2,000 US residents (with 43% identifying as moderate, 26% “liberal” or “very liberal,” and 28% “conservative” or “very conservative”). The poll results are compelling yet not surprising. Forty-two percent of Americans think the nation is hopelessly divided and will likely never be united again, and 45% say it's just a rough patch and that things will get better eventually. When it comes to living up to our democratic ideals, more respondents would give us an F (12%) than an A (11%). Merely 9% think the Founders would be very happy with how the legislative and judicial branches have evolved. Finally, most think we need to do much more to teach civics and history to schoolchildren.Discontent with today’s governance crosses generations. Asked which decade of their life was the best in terms of how the country was doing, no group chose the last 10 years, and the most overall favored decade was the 1990s (the ’80s was the narrow favorite of the Gen Xers and Boomers). We also asked how the Constitution and our government has and will serve Americans based on gender, age, and class, and there is broad agreement that White men have been favored by the current system over the last 50 years (84% says they are treated “reasonably” or “very” well), compared to people of color (48%) and lower-income Americans (38%). Respondents do not think these groups will be treated much differently by the Constitution and government over the next 50 years. It would be easy to view these figures through a negative lens, yet there is also reason to be inspired. These figures reflect an idealistic population that is frustrated, wants more unity, and understands the principles of our democracy. Facade banner of The New York Historical on Manhattan's Central Park West promoting the museum's year of 250th anniversary exhibitions (photo courtesy The New York Historical)This American idealism isn’t new. On July 9, 1776, George Washington ordered that the new Declaration of Independence be read to the Continental Army in Lower Manhattan; later that day, inspired by hearing the words spoken aloud, soldiers and sailors tore down a statue of King George III in Bowling Green. Idealism runs through our history. We currently have on display at our museum a 1774 petition written by enslaved Massachusetts residents asking for one day a week of freedom to earn their own wages. The invocation of our ideals helped fuel the turn-of-the-century women’s suffrage movement, Americans rallying to fight fascism, and even the flags and patriotism of my own progressive neighborhood in Brooklyn following September 11. America’s cultural landscape is perfectly designed for museums to harness this idealism and deepen citizens’ engagement with and knowledge of our nation’s history. With over 35,000 museums, our field is large and extremely diverse — reflecting the same of our nation — and there will be no one central place or way to celebrate. Nor should there be. In terms of content, our museums are meeting the moment. There are hundreds of major displays related to the 250th across the nation, with each institution flexing its own muscles. At The New York Historical, we are starting the year by leaning on archival items that illustrate the rhetoric and ideals that fueled the Declaration of Independence and by presenting a display of 150 years of immigration photography. The Moab Museum in Utah will soon have a 250th exhibition on the stories of the Colorado Plateau region. The Idaho State Museum will present America We Celebrate, a show on the traditions that have brought Americans, and Idahoans, together. In Massachusetts, the Concord Museum is returning to the material evidence of the Revolution itself, reexamining iconic 1775 objects. Every state has multiple contributions. And the large museums in our large cities each have compelling exhibitions, with accompanying concerts, programs, and more. Museum leaders know that just because we build it doesn’t mean that visitors will come. This is why messaging matters — as does operations – in the year ahead.We must innovate to generate visitors, including making it easier and more engaging to visit museums. We can start by staying open later. While most museums in Europe accommodate visitors' schedules and are open late on multiple evenings, many American museums follow bankers’ hours. Music, food, and booze help, too. When I was leading marketing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, two small additions — jazz music and drink specials — almost tripled Friday and Saturday evening attendance and delivered a younger, more diverse audience.When we invite visitors into our museums, we must resist the pull to simply commemorate and instead communicate the relevance of our history. We must not smooth over conflicts. The public is better served by and attracted to accurate descriptions of the challenges of building our nation.  I faced this question recently when, in a recent meeting, we needed copy for our façade banners announcing our 250th exhibitions. Bantering catchy titles on the Declaration or the 250th, we settled on a wordplay of sorts: “Democracy Lives Here.”America’s museums inspire trust in a nation where citizens are lamenting the gap between the ideals of our democracy and the actions of our government. Museums can and must provide a critical means to sustain the idealism of Americans, so that we can continue to build a more perfect union.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        Museums\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n\tKathleen Goncharov, a curator whose work included organizing shows for Just Above Midtown gallery, died at her home in Boca Raton, Florida, of natural causes on December 31. She was 73 years old. \n\n\tGoncharov served as senior curator at the Boca Raton Museum of Art in Florida from 2012 until she retired in 2025. She had previously worked as a curator at institutions throughout the US, curated exhibitions from Rio de Janeiro to Bologna and Rome, and served as the commissioner of the US Pavilion for the Venice Biennale in 2003, which that year took the form of an exhibition of Fred Wilson, “Speak of Me as I Am,” about the historical and contemporary role of Black people in Venice for the American pavilion.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“It was a great pleasure working with Kathleen Goncharov during my 11-year tenure at the Boca Raton Museum of Art,” said Irvin Lippman, who was the executive director from 2014 until 2025. “She had a fabulous curatorial eye that underscored my favorite comment ever made about our art installations — that our museum had soul, and this was due to Kathy’s talents as a curator. She possessed a natural flair for bringing exhibitions to life, in her singular style that was unmatched. At the museum, she curated more than 30 exhibitions featuring many notable artists, including: Tony Oursler, Whitfield Lovell, Phyllis Galembo, Maren Hassinger, José Alvarez (D.O.P.A.), Charles McGill, and Trine Lise Nedreaas, among others. She was also a great friend who will be greatly missed.” \n\n\tBorn in 1952 in Monroe, Michigan, Goncharov started out her career in New York in 1980 as curator at Linda Goode Bryant’s Just Above Midtown (JAM) Gallery, where she organized performances and exhibitions. She was director of exhibitions at New York public art presenter Creative Time from 1983 to 1986. \n\n\tShe went on to be art curator at the New School in New York City from 1987 to 2001, building an extensive collection and organizing public programs at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics. During that time, she also organized Wilson’s 1992 presentation at the fourth Cairo International Biennale, “Re:Claiming Egypt,” and curated a presentation at the seventh Triennale in New Delhi, India, in 1991. She was public art curator at MIT from 2001 to 2003, overseeing the school’s percent-for-art program and organizing the Venice exhibition. \n\t\n\n\tFrom 2003 to 2005 she served as adjunct curator of contemporary art at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and from 2007 to 2011 she was executive director at Brodsky Center for Innovative Editions, at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\n\tAmong the many artists she supported over the course of her long career were El Anatsui, Lynda Benglis, Petah Coyne, Grand Master Flash, Chitra Ganesh, David Hammons, Mona Hatoum, Barkley Hendricks, Isaac Julien, William Kentridge, Hew Locke, Thomas Nozkowski, Lorraine O’Grady, Tony Oursler, Martin Puryear, Duke Riley, Pat Steir, Mickalene Thomas, and Carrie Mae Weems.\n\n\tGoncharov was also, behind the scenes, a working artist for some 40 years. Her debut exhibition, “Above and Below,” appeared at New York’s Olympia gallery in 2022. “Goncharov points to artists such as Giotto, Duccio, Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesco, Masaccio, and especially the eccentric forms and colors of the Sienese painters such as Giovanni di Paolo, Sassetta, Master of the Osservanza, Sano di Pietro, and others—who approached religious subjectivity in their own distinctive fashion—as her central inspirations,” wrote the gallery in press materials.\n\n\tGoncharov is survived by her longtime partner, poet Charles Doria, her sister Janet Sterling and her sister’s husband Joseph Sterling, and nieces Ann Goff, Amy Sterling, and Emily Sterling, and their families; and by her brother Earl Shew, his wife Sharon Shew, and nephew Stephen Shew, and their family.\n",

He is the first Muslim to hold the position of Mayor of New York City.\n\n\tOne of the two Qur’ans used in the ceremony came from Mr. Mamdani’s grandfather. The other was lent by the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. According to the New York Times, the latter book was selected by Rahim and Rama Duwaji, Mamdani’s wife, with the help of Hiba Abid, curator of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at the NYPL.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tExecuted in red and black ink and thought to have been produced in the late 18th or early 19th century in Ottoman Syria, the Schomburg’s copy is modest in design and scale. As such, it was meant for everyday use, reflecting a central tenet of Mamdani’s winning campaign for mayor. “The significance of this Qur’an extends far beyond the beauty of its pages,” Abid said in a statement. “Its importance lies not in luxury, but in accessibility.”\n\n\tThe book was part of the personal collection of Arturo Alfonso Schomburg (1874–1938), the Afro–Puerto Rican scholar, writer, and bibliophile who over his lifetime amassed over 4000 books, manuscripts, and other items pertaining to Black art, culture, and religion before selling them to the NYPL. It will go on public display for the first time on January 6 at NYPL’s main branch as part of a celebration of the Schomburg’s 100th anniversary.  \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNewswire\n\t\n\n",

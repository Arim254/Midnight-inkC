    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://romainveillon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Romain Veillon</a>’s most recent body of work, <em>Secret Gardens</em>, the enigmatic allure of abandoned greenhouses takes center stage. Traveling to derelict sites to immortalize forgotten corners of the world, the French photographer invites viewers into spaces where humans are decentered.</p>\n<p>The boundaries between interior and exterior are a key element in Veillon’s approach to abandoned growing houses, where he emphasizes their convergence. “It is ironic to see that, on the contrary, nature felt imprisoned there and sought to break free from its captor, unleashing its unstoppable force,” the photographer shares in a series statement. “Now, we admire vegetation that has become one with the bars of its cage.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-960x641.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Romain Veillon of the interior of an abandoned greenhouse overtaken by dense, rollicking vegetation\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-960x641.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14.jpg 1500w\" /></figure>\n<p>Veillon’s photographs are formidable, documenting the power nature holds to eventually reclaim spaces no longer governed by human intervention. While echoes of the presence of man persist in each image—through shattered stained glass window panes, rusting pipes, and piles of unused pots—the commanding force of rollicking vegetation is a clear reminder that  in the end, nature endures beyond us.</p>\n<p>Find more on Veillon’s <a href=\"https://romainveillon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, and keep up with his practice on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/romain_veillon/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.

It was a momentous finale to a quarter-century odyssey that started at the cusp of the millennium and ended just last month. The road here was anything but straight, twisting through bureaucratic brambles and detours. Yet, isn’t every winding way toward belonging the true inheritance of wanderers at heart?</p>\n<p>Today, I stand at another crossroads. </p>\n<p>When Veken and I launched <em>Hyperallergic</em> in 2009, our venture was fueled by a love of art writing and the stubborn belief that an independent voice could thrive without the largesse of the 1%. My resolve to amplify stories untold and to champion marginalized voices ensured that we made waves in a stagnant art media pool, one where wealthy patrons preferred comfort over candor. Veken, for his part, proved naysayers wrong: Readers will rally for independent art writing, for stories rooted in fact, heart, and public good.</p>\n<p>Over 16 years, we became a home to over 2,500 voices while launching many into new fields. Together, we proved independence and criticality can flourish alongside a growing audience of readers invested in changing the landscape with thoughtful prose and electric ideas.</p>\n<p>Our work seeded new conversations. In-depth stories about archaeology, memes, social justice, protest, once peripheral, are now mainstream. Our playful candor, once ours alone among major art publications, is echoed in corporate outfits today. Authors who hatched their visions with us went on to bigger books and bolder inquiries. Through it all, we have relished the journey — sometimes after meeting a deadline, sometimes in the quiet aftermath. We are immensely proud of our role in shifting the discourse around art and its social impact and roles. It was a lot of work, but we got here.</p>\n<p>Making change in the field of contemporary art is never easy. When we began, we naïvely ignored the field’s idiosyncrasies — those invisible hands that stifle true journalism, laud superficial change or reform, and sometimes threaten to sap the joy from art’s urgent questions. But we persevered, cultivating a community of readers and writers who labor in and love the arts.</p>\n<p>Now, another transition: It’s time for a new Editor-in-Chief. Welcome, Hakim Bishara.</p>\n<p>A Palestinian writer, editor, curator, and artist, Hakim has authored some of the best reviews and opinions of the last few years, providing an unfiltered take on art that continued <em>Hyperallergic</em>’s commitment and work. Since joining <em>Hyperallergic </em>in 2019, he has woven his global and local instincts into every story. As Staff Reporter, Senior Editor, and most recently Managing Editor, he’s championed emerging and marginalized talent and encouraged us to look harder, dig deeper, and investigate issues we might have otherwise missed. His journalistic journey wound through international media, including contributions to <em>BBC</em>, <em>Euronews</em>, and more, touching on politics, art, and social change; his essays and criticism have appeared in <em>+972 Magazine</em>, the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>BOMB</em>, <em>Al Jazeera</em>, and beyond. In the last few years, Hakim has penned powerful reviews of exhibitions by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/916808/unspoken-truths-jenny-holzer-truisms-light-line-guggenheim-museum/\">Jenny Holzer</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/961351/ai-weiwei-knocks-down-the-building-blocks-of-empire/\">Ai Weiwei</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/995132/we-are-the-new-romantics-caspar-david-friedrich-met-museum/\">Caspar David Friedrich</a>, and an essay on the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1012944/the-fabricated-crisis-of-art-criticism/\">Fabricated Crisis of Art Criticism</a>,” which posited that “good art criticism <em>is</em> the crisis.”</p>\n<p>Hakim’s writing grapples with labor, funding, and representation, while maintaining a critical eye toward elitism and a heart for justice. He has received prestigious grants, holds an MFA in Art Writing from the School of Visual Arts, and studied law and international relations at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>I have a great deal of faith that Hakim will usher <em>Hyperallergic</em> into new, uncharted territories — challenging our old assumptions, forging fresh paths. Entrusting someone with the top role has long been my dream; now realized, I do so with confidence and anticipation.</p>\n<p>As for me: my role shifts to Editor-at-Large. My words, reviews, and reporting will continue on screens, in podcasts, and in more projects yet to come. But first, I’ll pause, as I step back a little to reflect on all we’ve built. In learning what it means to be an American, I am learning too to be less editor and more writer. I hope you will welcome Hakim to the helm of the best independent art publication anywhere as we continue to change and evolve. Under his watchful eye, I know <em>Hyperallergic</em> is in good hands.</p>\n\t</div>\n</article>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</section>",

The Trump administration had allegedly labeled it a “DEI program and event” and withdrawn funding for the show, which had been previously secured under the Biden administration. </p>\n<p>President Trump signed an executive order banning DEI initiatives, established to provide individuals from marginalized communities and lower socioeconomic backgrounds with equal opportunities in the workforce, on his first day in office.</p>\n<p><em>Before the Americas</em> was one of the earliest casualties in a series of art exhibitions and performances axed in the wake of the administration’s mandate.

She estimates there were “about 50 or 60 donors” who allowed for the show to continue at a different location. “It really brought us closer together as an art community,” Edwards said, “and it shows that we really understand the importance of having art and culture in our society, and that art transcends politics and orders.”</p>\n<p>When word got out that <em>Before the Americas </em>had been terminated, Donald Russell, director of Mason Exhibitions, which runs the Gillespie Gallery, immediately opened its doors for it. Edwards had previously worked with Russell in a different capacity, exhibiting his work. He had also been involved in the early stages of the exhibition in a consulting role. “I was absolutely prepared to take it on,” Russell told <em>Hyperallergic</em>.</p>\n<p>With bold color palettes and dynamic lines, the Afrocentric artworks represent the history of African-descendant artists. There’s striking power in Lois Mailou Jones’s 1996 silkscreen print of three African dancers, and subtle strength in Elizabeth Catlett’s “Niña” (1957), the profile of a young girl. </p>\n<p>“The history of African-descendant artists does not begin with slavery,” said Edwards. “That’s the whole point of this show.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=720%2C477&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=768%2C509&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1018&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1357&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=2000%2C1325&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=780%2C517&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=400%2C265&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=706%2C468&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2-1200x795.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Luis Vasquez La Roche, “The Cleanse (La Limpieza)” (2022)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p><em>Before the Americas</em> will be at Gillespie Gallery until November 15.

The show is small but tightly curated, a compressed burst of some of Pape’s most emblematic works that showcases the breadth of her experimental practice across media. In one gallery, the short film “O ovo” (The Egg, 1967) plays. In it, Pape presses against the taut skin of a white cube on a beach, tears through, and crawls into the sand — geometry giving way to flesh. Across the room, a panoramic projection of “Divisor,” performed at Rio de Janeiro’s Museu de Arte Moderna in 2010, spans the wall. In a plexiglass case sits “Livro da Criação” (Book of Creation, 1959–60), a defining piece of Pape’s Neo-Concrete period. It takes the form of 16 artist books that unfold pop-up sculptural forms such as triangles flaring into fire, a fan unfurling a wheel, and a red disc becoming a clock — a cosmos animated by our hands. </p>\n<p>On display, too, is the monumental “Livro Noite e Dia III” (Book of Night and Day III, 1963–76), comprising 365 carved wooden units arranged into a shifting field of black, white, and gray that maps the daily swing between light and dark across a year. And a gorgeous grouping of the <em>Tecelares</em>, woodcut prints she made throughout the 1950s depicting labyrinthine geometric motifs, works as an anteroom for what is undoubtedly the showstopper: the dazzling “Ttéia 1, C” (2001–7), in which hundreds of copper wires stretch across a pitch-dark room lit by spotlights, an immersive sensory experience that itself changes with our movements.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-1200x800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=720%2C480&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1333&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=780%2C520&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=400%2C267&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=706%2C471&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-1200x800.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Lygia Pape, “Livro Noite e Dia III” (Book of Night and Day III, 1963–76), tempera, latex, and acrylic on wood, 365 pieces (photo by Nicolas Brasseur/Pinault Collection, courtesy Projeto Lygia Pape)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Back on the street, “Divisor” expands that same participatory principle to a collective scale. More than 100 participants ducked under a long white sheet, their heads popping through slits, as they spilled out from the rear of La Bourse’s imposing neoclassical facade and glided like a giant white amoeba across the esplanade toward La Canopée des Halles. Phones held high, some filmed themselves and their fellow travellers. The mood was upbeat, buoyant; small children at the front gave the procession a playful air.</p>\n<p>Walking alongside this strange, lovely spectacle, it struck me that “Divisor” endures because it makes us <em>feel</em> collectivity as a physical condition rather than a concept — the brush of hair, the weight of fabric, the awkward give-and-take with strangers, freedom tested in public space. Yet this reenactment carries a trace of its own scaffolding — the museum, social media, the logic of the festival. In that sense, the Paris edition of “Divisor” felt less like a time capsule than a pulsing diagnostic: a fleeting republic stitched from cloth, bodies, and hashtags.</p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-1200x1800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1800&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1800&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=720%2C1080&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1152&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1536&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=1365%2C2048&quality=90&ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=683%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=2000%2C3000&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=780%2C1170&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=400%2C600&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=706%2C1059&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?w=1707&quality=90&ssl=1 1707w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-1200x1800.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Performance documentation of Lygia Pape, “Divisor” (2025) in Paris (photo by Souleymane Said, courtesy Projeto Lygia Pape)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pinaultcollection.com/en/boursedecommerce/lygia-pape-weaving-space\">Lygia Pape: Weaving Space</a> <em>continues at Bourse de Commerce – Pinault Collection (2 Rue de Viarmes, Paris, France) through January 26, 2026.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/milton-esterow/\">Milton Esterow</a>, an award-winning journalist who owned and edited <em>ARTnews</em> for 42 years, died on Friday at 97. His death was confirmed by his daughter Judith Esterow, who previously served as this magazine’s associate publisher. She did not state a cause.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPZQ32JjsQm/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\">a social media post</a>, Robin Cembalest, who served as executive editor of <em>ARTnews</em> under Esterow, wrote, “Milton trained generations of editors and writers, published scoop after scoop that won prize after prize, and was justly proud of the impact of the magazine’s relentless investigative journalism—particularly when it came to the restitution of Holocaust war loot.”\n\t</p>\n<section>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t</h2>\n</section>\n<p>\n\tShe added that “his passing marks the end of an era, for art magazines and for art journalism.”</p>\n<p>\n\tEsterow purchased <em>ARTnews</em> in 1972 from <em>Newsweek</em>, which at the time was a division of the Washington Post Company, and owned it until 2014, when <em>ARTnews</em> was sold in 2014 to Sergey Skaterschikov. (The publication was then acquired two years later by Peter Brant, who also owned <em>Art in America</em>; both publications have been owned by Penske Media Corporation since 2018.) During the time he owned <em>ARTnews</em>, Esterow transformed the magazine into a news-focused entity, infusing the publication with an energy it had lost in the years after its critics had helped define movements such as Abstract Expressionism and Pop during the postwar era.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>ARTnews</em> went on to gain national recognition for some of its investigative reports, some of which were authored by Esterow himself. Under his leadership, the magazine also introduced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-collectors/top-200-collectors/top-200-collectors/\">the annual <em>ARTnews</em> Top 200 Collectors list</a> in 1990, which this fall will publish its 36th edition. The closely watched list is today a cornerstone of <em>ARTnews</em>’s coverage.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Milton’s legacy of excellent journalism is hugely important to the magazine,” said Sarah Douglas, <em>ARTnews</em> Editor-in-Chief since 2014. “It has been a continual touchstone as we have moved <em>ARTnews</em> into the digital age.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOne could easily enumerate Esterow’s many achievements. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/14/insider/milton-esterow.html\" target=\"_blank\">a 2023 <em>New York Times</em> profile</a>, at age 94, he claimed to have written more than 6,000 articles in his lifetime—and he continued writing even more articles via his 1950 Royal typewriter after the piece was published. Under his leadership, <em>ARTnews</em> won one National Magazine Awards (for general excellence in 1981) and two George Polk Awards (both for cultural reporting in 1980 and 1991).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Esterow went about his job with a modesty that did not go unnoticed by outside observers: the critic Ben Davis once wrote that he was “hardly a flashy guy.” Within his newsroom, he was known as both a nurturing presence, with a habit of providing incoming hires with inspiration in the form of a printed packet of articles published by <em>ARTnews</em>. (One recipient of such a packet was this writer when he was onboarded as an intern.) </p>\n<p>\n\tA staple of that packet was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/top-ten-artnews-stories-a-modernist-manifesto-182/\">a 1957 essay on the avant-garde</a> by the art historian Meyer Schapiro published by <em>ARTnews.</em> Esterow once said was “probably the only genius I’ve known.” After taking over, Esterow tried to convince Schapiro to agree to a profile, but always received the answer that he was too busy. “Esterow repeated the request every year or two, and the response was always the same,” according to a 2007 article on <em>ARTnews</em>’s top 10 articles. Schapiro finally agreed after nearly a decade, and Esterow published the article by journalist Helen Epstein in 1983.</p>\n<p>\n\tMilton Esterow was born in 1928 in New York and was raised in Brooklyn. He showed an early predilection for journalism and even made his own newspaper when he was a kid, writing the articles by hand. </p>\n<p>\n\tHe attended Brooklyn College and, while he was a student there, got a job as a copy boy with the <em>New York Times</em>. His first task: going to Times Square to purchase horse betting sheets for the managing editor. </p>\n<p>\n\tEsterow went on to marry Jackie Esterow, with whom he had two daughters, Judith and Deborah. Milton and Jackie were together for 74 years; she died earlier this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1948, Esterow was named a reporter by the <em>Times</em>, leading him to drop out of college. “The <em>Times</em> newsroom,” Esterow would go on to recall, “was my journalism school.” He initially focused on crime, then turned his attention to the arts. </p>\n<p>\n\tEsterow’s approach, an unusual one for its era, involved treating art stories as occasions for investigative journalism. While others at the <em>Times</em> looked on at his work with befuddlement, Esterow plugged away and proved himself quite adept. In 1964, he published a story on plundered art in Europe during the years after World War II. The report made the front page of the <em>Times</em>—a rarity for an art story both during its time and now.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was promoted to assistant to the director of cultural news at the <em>Times</em> in 1968, though he went on to head up the publishing division of the Kennedy art galleries soon afterward. </p>\n<p>\n\tThen, in 1972, he led an eight-person investor group in acquiring <em>ARTnews</em>. The magazine was at the time devoted mainly to criticism. It was central to the New York art world of the 1950s, but its readership had dwindled; Esterow, knowing it needed a new focus, let go of nearly everyone at the magazine and proceeded to bring on a team of fresh hires. “The art world is fascinating and mysterious,” Esterow <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/12/archives/art-news-is-sold-to-8man-group-newsweek-divests-itself-of-monthly.html\" target=\"_blank\">told the <em>Times</em></a> on the occasion of the acquisition. “It is also underreported. There is a genuine thirst for art information that publications haven’t been satisfying.” (Not everyone was happy. Thomas B. Hess, then still the editor of <em>ARTnews</em>, said, “The loss of Art News is a loss to my alter ego.”)</p>\n<p>\n\tHis leadership of <em>ARTnews</em>, with his daughter Judith, put the magazine on a new course, and his impact was most evident in the investigatory pieces it began to publish. One from 1984 began with a tip to Esterow: an Austrian monastery held many Nazi-looted masterworks, and no one could visit it. Andrew Decker was assigned to the piece, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/artnews/news/top-ten-artnews-stories-making-a-difference-185/\">the resultant article</a> became one of many devoted to restitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tEsterow’s fascination with the behind-the-scenes goings-on of the art world was one reason he began the Top 200 Collectors list in 1990. The public knew that rich people were buying art, but there was little understanding of why, he recalled. Collectors “are of course big spenders, but at the same time there are so many different kinds of collections as there are collections,” Esterow told NPR in 2009. “Some collectors are happy, some are tormented. Some buy very little, while others can’t help themselves. Why do people collect?” He wanted to answer that question for himself and others.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter <em>ARTnews</em>’s 2014 sale, Esterow kept writing for outlets such as the <em>Art Newspaper</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>, with the latter paper continuing to publish his articles as recently as this past spring. That he continued writing well after he relinquished control of <em>ARTnews</em>—well after he vowed to “take it a little easy,” as he put it—showed his devotion to his craft.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-3VrfLEj0w\" target=\"_blank\">once said</a> he had no regrets about spending a career investigating the art world, save for one: “It hasn’t helped my tennis game, but that’s another story.”</p>\n</div>",

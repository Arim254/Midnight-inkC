    "body": "\n\tin Art, Artificial Intelligence, History |   \tDecember 15th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you want to know what it was like to live in sev­en­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don, read the diary of Samuel Pepys. While doing so, take note of his fre­quent ref­er­ences to the unclean­li­ness of the city’s streets: “very dirty and trou­ble­some to walk through,” “mighty dirty after the rain,” and dur­ing the large-scale rebuild­ing in the after­math of the Great Fire of 1666, “much built, yet very dirty and encum­bered.” If you want to know what it was like to live in nine­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don, read Charles Dick­ens. How­ev­er much-lament­ed the dif­fi­cul­ties it presents to young read­ers, the open­ing of Bleak House remains high­ly evoca­tive, set­ting the scene with “as much mud in the streets, as if the waters had but new­ly retired from the face of the earth,” “dogs, undis­tin­guish­able in mire, and “hors­es, scarce­ly bet­ter; splashed to their very blink­ers.”\nThis “mud,” an unspeak­ably foul admix­ture of sub­stances, only began to recede per­ma­nent­ly from Lon­don’s streets in the eigh­teen-fifties, after the instal­la­tion of sew­er sys­tems. So nor­mal for so long, its pres­ence would hard­ly have been down­played by the city’s observers back then, whether they record­ed their obser­va­tions on the page or on the can­vas.\nEven the painter’s ide­al­iz­ing impulse could only do so much, as evi­denced by some of the shots includ­ed in the new video tour of eigh­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don from Majes­tic Stu­dios above. Turn­ing con­tem­po­rary paint­ings and engrav­ings into cin­e­mat­ic ani­ma­tions with arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence-gen­er­at­ed video, it offers the next best thing to actu­al footage of the city as it would have been seen by the likes of Jonathan Swift, Samuel John­son, Thomas Gains­bor­ough, and Mary Woll­stonecraft.\nSev­en­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don was the cul­tur­al and com­mer­cial cen­ter of Geor­gian Eng­land, but also a city well on its way to becom­ing the cen­ter of the world. Some of its famous sights seen here in their eigh­teenth-cen­tu­ry urban con­text include St. Paul’s Cathe­dral by Sir Christo­pher Wren, mas­ter­mind of the city’s post-Great Fire recon­struc­tion; the old Lon­don Bridge, still lined with hous­es and shops; St. James’s Square after its trans­for­ma­tion from a state once con­sid­ered “mud­dy, neglect­ed, and frankly, embar­rass­ing for such pres­ti­gious address­es”; and the Tow­er of Lon­don on the bank of the Riv­er Thames. As for the riv­er itself, it hard­ly goes ignored by the works of art that shape this video, or indeed un-glo­ri­fied by them. But if you know any­thing about its con­di­tion before the turn of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, you’ll be relieved that AI can’t yet restore its smell.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Growth of Lon­don, from the Romans to the 21st Cen­tu­ry, Visu­al­ized in a Time-Lapse Ani­mat­ed Map\nTake a Vir­tu­al Tour of Shakespeare’s Globe The­atre in Lon­don\nThe Evo­lu­tion of Lon­don: 2,000 Years of Change Ani­mat­ed in 7 Min­utes\nThe Old­est Known Footage of Lon­don (1890–1920) Fea­tures the City’s Great Land­marks\nHear the Evo­lu­tion of the Lon­don Accent Over 660 Years: From 1346 to 2006\nThe Sights & Sounds of 18th-Cen­tu­ry Paris Get Recre­at­ed with 3D Audio and Ani­ma­tion\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tDecember 15th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOver the decades, Tom Jones has per­formed with the best of them. In 1969, we can find him singing “Long Time Gone” with Cros­by, Stills, Nash & Young, and tak­ing them delight­ful­ly by sur­prise. The same goes for his duet with Janis Joplin in that same year. Now fast for­ward to the 1990s. In this decade, Jones teamed up with the Swedish rock band The Cardi­gans and per­formed a rol­lick­ing ver­sion of the Talk­ing Heads “Burn­ing Down the House.” And, rather unex­pect­ed­ly, he would get paired with Pink Floy­d’s David Gilmour and croon Prince’s “Pur­ple Rain.”\nThe record­ing above comes from Jones’ show The Right Time, a six-episode tele­vi­sion series that aired in 1992. Trac­ing the evo­lu­tion of pop music, the show fea­tured appear­ances by Bob Geld­of, Cyn­di Lau­per, The Chief­tains and Ste­vie Won­der. When it comes to his ver­sion of “Pur­ple Rain,” don’t miss the Gilmour solo mid­way through.

Without color, what would you have?”Sad beige is officially over, if it ever really began. Look no further for proof than these words from 83-year-old artist Sylvia Snowden, whose paintings are live currents of electricity, organisms of paint and movement.She opens up about her childhood in New Orleans, learning from giants of Black modernism at Howard University, and the community on her street in DC that inspired an entire series in an interview with critic Jasmine Weber. Snowden has dedicated her career to capturing the humanity at the core of these paintings, and to making the people for whom she names them think, Somebody cares enough of me to represent me.It’s surreal to read this lovely interview on the one hand, and behold the truly ridiculous new TIME cover photo on the other. It’s not the first time the publication has been criticized for being out of touch with, well, the literal rest of the world. But it takes a special kind of villainy to think naming its 2025 Person of the Year simply “Architects of AI” and swapping the construction workers in the iconic “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper” photograph (1932) with odious tech billionaires was a good idea.

I've never won a single prize in my life, but I can't stop thinking about how good that little Picasso would look on my living room wall, and how humble I'd be when guests asked about it. I guess I paid for the fantasy, more than anything.Sonya Yu, a Bay Area art collector and entrepreneur, is someone who probably can afford a Picasso without a raffle. She has written off three years of admission fees for MoMA PS1 in Queens, New York, making entry to the museum free for everyone. How kind.Less fortunate are faculty members at the New School in Manhattan. A staggering 40% of them have received buyouts or early retirement offers. No wonder they went out in the cold this week to protest against the decision. The school says it has no other choice, as it faces a $48 million deficit.In better news, Jennifer Samet's popular column Beer With a Painter is back. It's a series of in-depth interviews with painters about their practice. This month, Jennifer speaks with artist Melissa Joseph, whose intimate felt paintings truly expand the medium.And as the year draws to an end, we look back on the art, books, and memes that defined 2025.

    "body": "\n\tArt Basel has released full details for its inaugural Qatar edition, which will open in Doha next February and mark the fair’s first expansion into the Middle East. \n\n\tThe new event, staged in partnership with Qatar Sports Investments and QC+, will run February 5–7, 2026, with preview days on February 3–4. It will take place across Msheireb Downtown Doha, centering on venues M7 and the Doha Design District. \n\n\tThe debut fair will bring together 87 galleries from 31 countries showing work by 84 artists, more than half from across the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. Artist Wael Shawky is leading the curatorial direction for the fair, which will take the theme “Becoming” and looks at transformation in all its many forms.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tA major component of the launch is an expansive Special Projects program, described by the fair as the most extensive suite of public works ever realized for an Art Basel show. Installed throughout Msheireb, the program includes large-scale and site-specific works by Bruce Nauman, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Nalini Malani, Hassan Khan, Rayyane Tabet, Nour Jaouda, Sumayya Vally, Khalil Rabah, and Sweat Variant (Okwui Okpokwasili and Peter Born). Projects range from Nauman’s immersive 3D video environment inside M7’s grand theatre to Cruzvillegas’s largest iteration of his long-running “autoconstrucción” series. \n\n\tThe Galleries sector features presentations from Almine Rech, Athr, David Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, Lia Rumma Gallery, Pace, Sfeir-Semler, and the Third Line, among others. Highlights include Etel Adnan works jointly presented by Anthony Meier and Waddington Custot; major paintings from Marlene Dumas’s Against the Wall series at David Zwirner; new works by Shirin Neshat at Lia Rumma; a suite of Lynda Benglis ceramics at Pace; and a presentation of studies and works-in-progress by Emirati conceptualist Hassan Sharif at Gallery Isabelle. \n\n\tThe fair coincides with a broad slate of exhibitions across Qatar Museums, including two major shows marking the 15th anniversary of Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art; retrospectives on architect I.M. Pei at both ALRIWAQ and the Museum of Islamic Art; Rirkrit Tiravanija’s participatory installation in MIA Park; and an immersive MF Husain exhibition at QM Gallery Katara.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Guggenheim Museum will this year new launch a new art prize. Titled the Jack Galef Visual Arts Award, the $50,000 prize is being endowed by the estate of Jack Galef and will be given out biennially to an artist working in sculpture, installation, and related mediums.\n\n\tThe prize’s first winner is Catherine Telford Keogh, whose sculptures consider the past lives of found materials and the connections between the environment and the global economy.\n\n\t“Being the first artist recognized by this honor is something I carry with care and don’t take for granted,” she said in an email to ARTnews. “Awards like this offer artists something increasingly rare: the time and space to explore, to follow curiosity where it leads, and to move vertically, delving deeper rather than yielding to the pressure of quick decisions. So much of my work depends on durational attention, on exploring systems through field research and collaboration, on staying with materials and processes long enough to let them reveal what they’re already doing.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tShe said she planned to use the honorarium to support two future projects: “one examines contamination and microbial life in the Gowanus Canal, a Superfund site where I’ve lived and worked for six years, exploring how bacteria have evolved to metabolize what industrial processes left behind; the other, for a solo exhibition in Portland, traces a history of instruments designed to measure, regulate, and discipline eating, from eighteenth-century fantasies of the meal-in-a-pill to contemporary technologies that optimize the body for productivity. Both projects ask how materials, and the bodies entangled with them, persist within cycles of circulation that exceed human intention or control.”\n\n\tThe newly founded Jack Galef Visual Arts Award is now the only art award facilitated by the Guggenheim, which works with LG to offer a $100,000 prize for technology-focused artists. The most recent Guggenheim LG Award went to Ayoung Kim, a Korean artist whose work is being surveyed at MoMA PS1.\n\n\tPreviously, the Guggenheim used to run the Hugo Boss Prize, a closely watched art award that came with $100,000. The award was last given out in 2020 and was declared defunct in 2022.\n",

    "body": "\n            Happy last Saturday of the year. We've spent the past few weeks rounding up the best of the best of 2025 — our favorite exhibitions and artworks, the books and films that moved us, memes that made us laugh and helped us process an increasingly dystopian reality. We also published our annual 20 Most Powerless list, a Hyperallergic tradition dating back to our founding days that parodies the market-driven media's arbitrary “most powerful” rankings. Our first-ever Powerless list, published in 2009 (!), included “assistant curators living off $27,000 salaries,” and we're afraid not much has changed ... This year, we shout out undocumented immigrants, artists who've been censored, and other unsung heroes of the art world who are fighting for rights and recognition in spite of every effort to stop them.This week, we also remembered the artistic legends who left us this year. Artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, filmmaker David Lynch, architect Frank Gehry, and photographer Nona Faustine are among the giants who will remain with us in spirit and through their outsized imprint on the world. Each week, my colleague Associate Editor Lisa Yin Zhang’s In Memoriam column offers thoughtful tributes to artists we lost, part of Hyperallergic’s commitment to honoring legacies as we look ahead. Because art never sleeps, you’ll also find below our usual mix of criticism, news, community columns, and opinions: an art worker's letter to incoming NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Wes Anderson recreation of Joseph Cornell's studio in Paris, A View From the Easel, and lots more. Finally, please take a few seconds to read this personal message from our Editor-in-Chief Hakim Bishara to learn a little more about Hyperallergic’s work and why it matters so much that you support us in this moment. —Valentina Di Liscia, senior editorBest of 2025Undocumented immigrants, censored artists, and one famous Paris museum's security system are on our powerless list this year.

    "body": "\n            I joined Hyperallergic six years ago because I was drawn to its integrity and its commitment to tell stories that no other art publication would. And then I discovered the most rewarding part of working here — the freedom to speak my mind without fear. That’s not something to take for granted in a field plagued by bad-faith journalism and subservient, uncritical thinking. Now, as editor-in-chief of Hyperallergic, these values are my north star. This is my pledge: We will always speak our minds freely to meet the moment. We will stand for truth, justice, and equal rights for all. We will fight against tyranny, racism, misogyny, anti-LGBTQ+ hate, and elitism in the art world and beyond.We will hold art institutions and power players accountable.  We will champion art workers, art teachers and students, labor organizers, community activists, and marginalized groups — and help them be seen and heard. And we will always see art as a basic human right, not an investment asset for the ultra-wealthy. We’ve proven our commitment to these values for 16 years, sometimes at the cost of our bottom line. Help me lead Hyperallergic into this next chapter of its history. There’s still so much more to do and say. So much to fight for and against. I need you by my side. Please join as a member today!   Sincerely,Hakim BisharaEditor-in-Chief\n                  \n                      \n                        Membership\n                      \n                      \n                        Newsletter\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Pro-Palestine protesters jailed. Migrants disappeared from the streets of the United States. Trans individuals persecuted and denied life-saving care. Indigenous people's rights under threat.There was no shortage of injustices in 2025. Refusing to be desensitized by the perpetual scroll of tragic images and news headlines, artists and creative activists mobilized their mediums in pursuit of change, sometimes risking their own lives and livelihoods. Below are 10 works that spoke truth to power in 2025, a decidedly non-comprehensive list of murals, protest actions, museum exhibitions, and other artistic gestures to carry us with intention and courage into the new year.Banksy’s Mural in Support of Palestine ProtestersBanksy's September mural at the Royal Courts of Justice (screenshot Hyperallergic via @Banksy on Instagram)On September 8, two days after the mass arrests of 900 people who were protesting in support of Palestinian activists in London, Banksy revealed a chilling new mural on the exterior of the city's Royal Courts of Justice building. The elusive street artist's characteristically stenciled image — which was quickly covered up by authorities — depicted a court judge beating a protester with his gavel. It was an uncompromising denunciation of the British government's ban on the activist group Palestine Action, which was designated a “terrorist” organization in July. Ironically, Banksy's image is all the more powerful because it was scrubbed from the wall, leaving a haunting silhouette that became a protest artwork in its own right. An Aerial Photo of Migrants' Cry for HelpA drone view of detainees forming the letters SOS with their bodies in the courtyard at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, April 28, 2025 (© Reuters/Paul Ratje)Photojournalist Paul Ratje, who covers immigration and border issues on the ground from the US-Mexico border, captured this rare aerial image of imprisoned migrants spelling out the letters “SOS” from the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas. The mostly Venezuelan men held at Bluebonnet, labeled \"alien enemies\" with little or no evidence by the Trump administration, feared they could be deported to the infamous maximum security prison in El Salvador, CECOT. Ratje said journalists were not given access to the detention facility and he had little face-to-face contact with anyone in the town, making his experience of taking the photograph “surreal.”“Having this exchange with the detainees, albeit through the lens of my drone, was unexpected for me,” Ratje told Hyperallergic. “In my eyes, their decision to communicate with my drone was a clear indication of the urgency and anxiety they must have been feeling, under threat of being sent to CECOT with its brutal reputation.”\"Trans Forming Liberty\" by Amy SheraldA visitor with Amy Sherald's painting “Trans Forming Liberty\" (2024) at the Whitney Museum of American Art (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic) One of the defining images of 2025 is without a doubt Amy Sherald's “Trans Forming Liberty,” her portrait of a pink-haired Black trans woman, modeled after drag performer and musician Arewà Basit, dressed as the titular symbol of freedom and hope. Though painted in 2024, the artwork took on new significance this year, when Sherald canceled her planned exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in July over fears that the piece would be censored amid Trump's crackdown on the Smithsonian Institution. “When governments police museums, they are not simply policing exhibitions,” Sherald wrote in MSNBC’s opinion blog. “They are policing imagination itself.”Duane Linklater's Buffalo SculpturesA buffalo sculpture from the installation “wallowposition” in Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)Omaskêko Ininiwak (Cree) artist Duane Linklater explored the symbiotic relationship between Native people and buffalo in his poignant exhibition 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea, anchored by seven wire and papier-mâché sculptures of the animals that are at once majestic and tender. Unlike the millions of buffalo killed by White settlers, part of a genocidal campaign to deny Indigenous people literal and spiritual sustenance, Linklater's bison roam free. They are deliberately rendered in various wallowing poses, like rolling in the dirt, which buffalo tend to assume when they feel comfortable, safe, and happy. In creating such an environment, Linklater gestures toward a future where Native life is neither contained nor threatened.A Climate Change Warning After LA FiresEddie Rodolfo Aparicio's painting at the California Common Good Rally (photo by Brooke Anderson, courtesy David Solnit)Victims of the Los Angeles fires rallied outside the Chevron oil refinery in Northern California in March, protesting the role of fossil fuels in creating the hot and dry conditions that we now know contributed to the spread of the blazes. At the center of that rally and another in Pasadena was a painting of a still-standing chimney emitting a thick cloud of black smoke, created by Eddie Rodolfo Aparicio along with David Solnit and dozens of volunteers. A call for action — “Invest in Communities, Not Fossil Fuels,” written in both English and Spanish — encircles the image, which draws on the metaphorical power of the chimneys that survived the fires. Aparicio, who lost his home in Altadena in the Eaton Fire, told Hyperallergic's LA Correspondent Matt Stromberg that he is “always looking at symbols that can hold both sides of an emotion: resilience and trauma.”The Drawing Protesters Refused to ForgetA sign at a No Kings protest in New York City (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)The drawing that President Trump reportedly gifted Jeffrey Epstein, part of a crude 50th birthday album for the convicted sex trafficker whose contents were made public earlier this year, spoke for itself. The sketch featured a cryptic imaginary conversation between the president and Epstein, typed within the outline of a woman’s body and signed “Trump” in place of her pubic hair. But a new version of the image quickly began circulating, one co-opted by concerned citizens demanding transparency and accountability. They replicated the now-infamous hourglass shape on protest placards and posters like the one above, captured by Hyperallergic co-founder and Editor-at-Large Hrag Vartanian at a “No Kings” protest in October. We resurface the damning visual amid the year-end release of a trove of new Epstein files, some containing serious allegations against Trump, and the promise of a million more to come.17,000 Children's Shoes for Gaza on Pennsylvania AvenueA shoe memorial organize by the New York City cultural advocacy organization the People’s Forum. April 5, 2025, in Washington, DC. (photo Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)In a devastating visual of the massacres committed by Israel in Gaza, the New York City-based group People’s Forum lined up approximately 17,000 pairs of kids' shoes — based on the number of Palestinian children killed between October 2023 and April 2025 — on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. Hyperallergic Staff Writer Isa Farfan captured the seemingly endless rows of tiny sandals and colorful sneakers arranged along the historic thoroughfare, a classic route of official government parades and protest marches. Israeli violence continued in Gaza despite a ceasefire agreement in October, reportedly killing hundreds of Palestinians since then. The Coming of the Lord by Fabián CháirezFábian Cháirez, \"La venida del señor\" (2018) (photo by Lalo Hermosilla Hanus/blok_studio_, courtesy the artist)Mexican artist Fabián Cháirez began creating his exquisitely painted portraits of queer priests and nuns in suggestive postures several years ago, but the works became a flashpoint of debates over artistic freedom in 2025. La venida del Señor (The coming of the Lord), Cháirez's solo exhibition at the Academia de San Carlos Centro Historico, which is affiliated with Mexico's national university, was censored in February after protests by Christian and right-wing groups. Cháirez told Hyperallergic that he perceived a “double standard” in the suppression of his works: \"I think there are other issues we should be protesting against, such as the church's abuse of power and sexual abuses within the church,\" he said.An Anti-Authoritarian Show Censored by ChinaDoc Tenzin, “Earth is Heard\" (2025) at the Bangkok Art & Culture Centre (photo courtesy the artist)An exhibition of works by artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and the Uyghur diaspora at the Bangkok Art & Culture Centre was heavily censored under pressure from Chinese authorities in August. Texts were blacked out, videos were turned off, and the flags of East Turkestan (Xinjiang) and Tibet were removed from the installation “Earth is Heard” (2025) by trans Tibetan artist Tenzin Mingyur Paldron (Doc Tenzin), among other alterations. The organizers of Constellation of Complicity: Visualising the Global Machinery of Authoritarian Solidarity, including an artist from Myanmar who reportedly fled the country in fear of persecution, said they opted to leave the show up with the covered artworks “as a statement itself.\"Nativities That Confront ICE’s CrueltyThe Nativity scene at St. Susanna Parish on December 3, 2025 (photo by Suzanne Kreiter/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)From the West Coast to the Vatican, the tradition of using Nativity scenes to convey humanitarian solidarity with migrants, displaced people, and oppressed communities is not new. The practice continued this year with particularly unflinching displays criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its record of violent aggression. One such example, the Nativity scene at St. Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, pictured above, came under attack by right-wing politicians for including a sign that read \"ICE WAS HERE\" in place of the Holy Family.Honorable Mention: The Statue of LibertyStreet artist Doug Groupp (aka Clown Soldier)'s “Attack on Liberty” graffiti (photo Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)She made appearances on protest signs and subway graffiti; on a mural in France and in marches at home, where demonstrators donned her gown, crown, and iconic torch to condemn the US government's abuses of power. From Amy Sherald's aforementioned portrait to politicians' calls for the sculpture's repatriation, Lady Liberty's remixes and resurgences reveal the public's hunger for art and symbols that rally communities and inspire action across time.\n                  \n                      \n                        Best of 2025\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

From our coverage of the Louvre heist to the rising authoritarianism in the White House, this year has generated plenty of fodder for art discourse, memes, and more.

What began as the usual background hum of disputes swelled into something grander: collectors accusing advisers, advisers suing one another, estates defending colors, sneaker companies parsing securities law, and even a SoHo garden insisting—quite earnestly—that it is a work of art entitled to federal protection. It was a year in which everyone, from billionaires to anonymous artists, seemed determined to prove that the only medium more enduring than bronze is litigation.\n\n\tPart of the spectacle—if one can call it that—was the dizzying range of conflicts. Some were baroque financial dramas in which auction houses behaved more like investment banks than cultural institutions. Others rose from the sediment of decades-old handshake deals and foggy memories involving motorcycles and Malibu property. Threading through all of them was a single contradiction the art world can no longer ignore: a market built on secrecy that now finds itself hauled, blinking, into the fluorescent glare of legal scrutiny. If 2025 had a mood, it was the realization that discretion is no defense against a motivated plaintiff.\n\n\tWhat follows is a thematically organized tour through the year’s dozen most revealing lawsuits—cases that together map the pressure points of a field undergoing a reluctant reckoning. The picture that emerges is of an industry discovering, with mounting discomfort, that mystique is a poor substitute for governance.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarket Mechanics: Billionaire Jan Koum’s Suit Pulls Acquavella, Nahmad Contemporary, and Perrotin into Discovery\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo David Ramos/Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWhen WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum accused interior designer Rémi Tessier in October of inflating invoices and pocketing improper commissions, the lawsuit quickly expanded beyond décor. Tessier’s dealings with major galleries—Acquavella, Nahmad Contemporary, and Perrotin—became central to Koum’s claim that the designer used legitimate art purchases to pad bills for unsuspecting clients.\n\n\tThe galleries, none of which are accused of wrongdoing, objected to sweeping discovery requests they say would expose confidential pricing structures and internal negotiations. Their pushback is understandable: few industries rely as heavily on discretion as the gallery world.\n\n\tYet the case raises an uncomfortable question: when billionaires litigate, how private can the art market remain? Depending on how the court rules, 2025 may be remembered as the year clients began prying open the black box.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarket Mechanics: Art Advisers Barbara Guggenheim and Abigail Asher Sue Each Other\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo Gregg DeGuire/WireImage\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tFor an industry that prides itself on discretion, nothing was more startling this year than watching two A-list advisers—Barbara Guggenheim and Abigail Asher—air decades of grievances in dueling lawsuits. Guggenheim claims Asher diverted clients and funds; Asher counters that Guggenheim torpedoed professional relationships and smeared her reputation.\n\n\tAdvisers typically operate in the genteel gray zone between confidant and broker, and the profession’s currency is trust. When that trust breaks down, the results are spectacularly unseemly.\n\n\tThe case has become an inadvertent tutorial on how advisers actually work: on relationships, not rules. Going forward, expect far fewer handshake agreements—and far more paperwork.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tMarket Mechanics: Jacob ‘Jacqui’ Safra Sues Christie’s for Bad Faith in a $100 M. Consignment\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: PA Images via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIn January, Swiss financier Jacqui Safra launched an unusually sweeping attack on Christie’s, accusing the house of mishandling a $100 million consignment that included Old Masters, antiques, and a trove of Einstein love letters. He claims the auction house failed to market the works properly, botched attributions, delayed applying proceeds, and wrongly declared him in default on a $63 million advance.\n\n\tChristie’s insists it followed the contract to the letter. Yet the allegations hit at the heart of the modern auction model, where houses play lender, marketer, expert, and seller simultaneously—a bundle of roles that works beautifully until it doesn’t.\n\n\tThe case may force courts to define where fiduciary duty ends and commercial discretion begins. For consignors—and auction houses accustomed to wide latitude—that line matters.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAuthenticity and Attribution: Pace Faces Suit Over Louise Nevelson Sculpture Pulled From Sotheby’s\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Court documents/Beloff Complaint\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tWhen a Nevelson sculpture was abruptly withdrawn from Sotheby’s in 2022 after Pace raised concerns about its authenticity, the estate of collector Hardie Beloff accused the gallery of sabotaging the sale. Most claims were dismissed, but a key one—wrongful interference—survived, keeping the gallery in the legal spotlight.\n\n\tBecause Pace has long shaped Nevelson’s market, its doubts carry unusual weight. That influence is now part of the dispute: when does due diligence become overreach? The surviving claim, which has yet to be settled, ensures the art world will continue scrutinizing how much power major galleries wield when they whisper a single, dangerous word: questionable.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAuthenticity and Attribution: Phillips Sues David Mimran Over Unpaid $14.5 M. Pollock Guarantee\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: WireImage\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIn July, Phillips alleged that film producer David Mimran failed to honor a third-party guarantee for a Pollock that sold in 2024. According to the complaint, Mimran acknowledged the debt, asked for time, and then declared he could not pay. The auction house is seeking nearly $15 million with interest.\n\n\tThird-party guarantees now underwrite a significant portion of evening auctions, and they rely on a delicate combination of bravado and liquidity. When either falters, the entire system wobbles.\n\n\tMimran told the press he simply intended to “buy it a little late.” Phillips disagrees. The courts will decide whether such lateness is a privilege or a breach.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tAuthenticity and Attribution: Steve McQueen’s Granddaughter Sues for Return of a $68 M. Pollock\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIn one of the year’s most cinematic disputes, Molly McQueen sued to recover a Jackson Pollock drip painting she says belonged to her grandfather. In the complaint, McQueen claims that Steve McQueen traded the work “in anticipated exchange for a motorcycle and Latigo Canyon property. However, one of the Borcherts crashed the motorcycle and the property never changed title.”\n\n\tThe Borchert family maintains the arrangement was informal, distant, and possibly apocryphal. Memories dating to the 1970s do not always make compelling legal evidence. Still, the case highlights a truth the market prefers to ignore: some of the most valuable works circulating today were acquired in a world far looser, hazier, and less documented than the one we now inhabit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tProvenance and Restituion: Czech Claimant Sues Christie’s for Information on Nazi-Looted Schieles\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMiloš Vávra sued Christie’s in New York seeking the locations of two Schieles connected to the Grünbaum collection, arguing that auction-house nondisclosure agreements prevent him from filing restitution claims before the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act expires in 2026.\n\n\tAuction houses consider confidentiality a core obligation; heirs consider it a stone wall. The case pits these principles against each other with unusual clarity. With the HEAR Act’s sunset approaching, Vávra’s suit could accelerate a broader reckoning: secrecy and restitution are, by definition, incompatible.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tProvenance and Restitution: Collector Sasan Ghandehari Sues Christie’s Over Picasso Once Owned by Convicted Smuggler\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tGhandehari, whose firm guaranteed a Picasso at Christie’s, claims the auction house failed to disclose that a previous owner—José Mestre Sr.—had been convicted of cocaine trafficking. Christie’s says it met all legal obligations and calls the suit a simple debt dispute.\n\n\tAs anti–money laundering rules tighten, prior ownership carries more risk than ever. Guarantors, who assume massive financial exposure, want transparency; auction houses, who protect client confidentiality, resist it. This case could set a precedent for what auction houses must reveal—not only about the work, but about the people who have owned it.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tArtists’ Rights and Cultural Property: Yves Klein Estate Wins Trademark Suit Against Stuart Semple\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo by Cat Morley/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tA French court ruled that Stuart Semple’s “Easy Klein” infringed the Yves Klein estate’s trademark, ordering him to halt sales and pay damages. Semple framed his paint as a democratic challenge to proprietary color; the court saw it as a deliberate commercial appropriation.\n\n\tThe ruling clarifies an increasingly crowded zone where parody, remix culture, and intellectual property collide. For estates guarding artistic legacies, it is a welcome line in the sand. For artists hoping to test those boundaries, it is a reminder that cheekiness does not always withstand litigation.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tArtists’ Rights and Cultural Property: Full Color Black Attempts to Cancel the ‘Banksy’ Trademark\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\tGreeting-card company Full Color Black petitioned to cancel Banksy’s trademark, arguing the anonymous artist has not used it legitimately in commerce. In their challenge, Full Color Black has taken to using Banksy’s own words and actions regarding copyright—which in the past he has flounced—to argue its case. Pest Control Office, Banksy’s firm, will try to prove in court that the artist has in fact sold merchandise of his work, and therefore retains trademark. The dispute is still unfolding.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tArtists’ Rights and Cultural Property: Manhattan Nonprofit Attempts to Protect Elizabeth Street Garden Under VARA\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Photo Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tIn February, the director of the Elizabeth Street Garden sued New York City, arguing the beloved community space is a “social sculpture” protected under the Visual Artists Rights Act. The city has plans to build affordable senior housing on the lot; supporters argue the garden’s decades-long evolution gives it artistic standing.\n\n\tThe claim is bold. VARA traditionally protects discrete works, not environments shaped by volunteers, neighbors, and time itself. Still, the suit arrives at a cultural moment when the definition of public art is expanding—and when communities increasingly use art law as a shield against development.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tTech and Securities: RTFKT Users Hit Nike with $5 M. NFT Class Action Lawsuit\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Credit: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tAfter Nike shuttered its RTFKT NFT platform, users filed a class action alleging the company sold unregistered securities by promoting NFT sneakers as investments tied to Nike’s brand power. The plaintiffs claim heavy losses; Nike has declined to comment.\n\n\tThe case sits at the messy intersection of art, collectibles, and securities law—a zone regulators are only beginning to map. Whether these NFTs qualify as securities could set an important early standard. NFTs may have cooled, but their legal fallout is only just heating up. This case is unlikely to be the last.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNewswire\n\t\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tA recently released set of files related to Jeffrey Epstein implied that the convicted sex criminal’s ties to collector Leslie Wexner ran deeper than some previously thought, placing new scrutiny on the former Victoria’s Secret CEO.\n\n\tOne email from an FBI official that was released to the public this week referred to potential “co-conspirators” who had worked with Epstein. While the email was heavily redacted, like other files released by the Department of Justice on December 23, the message clearly refers to Wexner, the namesake collector behind the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tEpstein and Wexner’s professional relationship is well-documented. Epstein managed Wexner’s finances and even acted as a trustee to the businessman’s foundation. According to the New York Times, Epstein at one point owned a home near Wexner’s estate.\n\n\tBut some have claimed that Wexner may have been aware of Epstein’s crimes. In her memoir, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, mentioned Wexner and urged readers not to “be fooled by those… who say they didn’t know.”\n\n\tSpeaking to the Columbus Dispatch, a spokesperson for Wexner said that he had participated in investigations related to Epstein. The spokesperson referred the Dispatch to a comment from an investigator who worked on the Epstein case. That investigator stated that Wexner was “neither a co-conspirator nor target in any respect” in the inquiry.\n\n\tThough best known for leading brands such as Victoria’s Secret and Abercrombie, Wexner and his wife Abigail are also recognized for their art collection, appearing on the annual ARTnews Top 200 Collectors list each year between 2003 and 2018. They have purchased major works by modernists such as Pablo Picasso, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, and more.\n",

    "body": "\n\tZahi Hawass, a well-known Egyptian archaeologist, renewed his promise to bring an ancient bust of Nefertiti home this week, claiming that his country was readier than ever to host it once more, thanks to the recent opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum near Giza.\n\n\tHe called once more for Berlin’s State Museums to return the bust of Nefertiti, which dates to ca. 1351 BCE–1334 BCE and is among the most famous ancient Egyptian artifacts held outside Egypt. It has repeatedly faced calls for repatriation across the years, and was very nearly given back to Egypt during World War II, when the Nazi regime thought that doing so would help Germany curry favor with Egyptians.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tLudwig Borchardt, a German Egyptologist, found the bust in 1912 at Tell Al-Amarna and brought it back with him. Since 2009, the bust has been on view at the Neues Museum.\n\n\tGermany has maintained that the bust was exported legally. Hawass’s position on what really happened in 1912 has changed over time. In 2010, Hawass told National Geographic that the sculpture was not looted, though he added, “I really want it back.” But in 2024, he described the bust as “brazenly stolen” in an interview with Deutsche Welle.\n\n\tIn a Washington Post interview published this week, Hawass rebutted a familiar argument against repatriation often given by Western museums: that institutions in parts of the Global South are not up to standard because they lack proper climate control systems and other measures found in American and European museums. “You cannot say that Egypt cannot protect its artifacts,” Hawass told the Washington Post. “There is no museum that has the quality of display of the Grand Museum.”\n\n\tHawass is a controversial figure in archaeology, having previously faced allegations of corruption and claims that he was overly involved with the autocratic Mubarak regime. Yet his pronouncements on Egyptian archaeology are closely followed—especially with the Grand Egyptian Museum now fully open following a partial inauguration in 2024. The 968,000-square-foot museum, known as GEM for short, has attracted at least 15,000 visitors daily, according to the Egyptian government.\n\n\tSpeaking to the Post, Hawass said GEM was the best place to view Nefertiti—and that he won’t visit Berlin to see the bust. “I refuse to go and see the bust of Nefertiti at all,” he said. “This bust should be in Egypt, and I will bring it to Egypt.”\n",

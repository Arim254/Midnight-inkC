    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHav­ing pre­vi­ous­ly con­sid­ered whether come­di­ans are the philoso­phers of our time, we must now ask whether they, too, build upon the work of oth­er philoso­phers. Few of today’s most promi­nent fun­ny men and women live a philo­soph­i­cal life — or have cul­ti­vat­ed the tem­pera­ment nec­es­sary to live a philo­soph­i­cal life — more pub­licly than Jer­ry Sein­feld. This has been sug­gest­ed by, among oth­er things, a 2012 New York Times Mag­a­zine pro­file by Jon­ah Wein­er. “Sein­feld will nurse a sin­gle joke for years, amend­ing, abridg­ing and rework­ing it incre­men­tal­ly, to get the thing just so,” writes Wein­er. “It’s sim­i­lar to cal­lig­ra­phy or samu­rai,” Sein­feld says. “I want to make crick­et cages. You know those Japan­ese crick­et cages? Tiny, with the doors? That’s it for me: soli­tude and pre­ci­sion, refin­ing a tiny thing for the sake of it.”\nOr, as Sein­feld puts it in the more recent inter­view above with pod­cast­er Gra­ham Ben­siger, he wants to know what time it is, but he wants even more to take the watch apart in order to learn how it works. This has become his life­long quest, in his pro­fes­sion­al are­na of com­e­dy and with his oth­er obses­sions as well.\nCul­ti­vat­ing both his under­stand­ing and him­self has entailed indulging his taste for dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions, or rather, chal­lenges with­in what he calls the appro­pri­ate “brack­et of strug­gle.” At this point in the jour­ney, he’s found what could at first sound like a sur­pris­ing guide: sec­ond-cen­tu­ry Roman emper­or Mar­cus Aure­lius, whose book the Med­i­ta­tions, along with Epicte­tus’ Enchirid­ion and the writ­ings of Seneca the Younger, con­sti­tute the core texts of Sto­icism.\n\n\n\t\n\nTo live Sto­ical­ly in the Aure­lian sense is to bear always in mind that, as Sein­feld puts it, “every­thing that you’re wor­ried about is going to be gone like that. The peo­ple that are crit­i­ciz­ing you, they’re going to be gone. You’re going to be gone. All this hand-wring­ing, wor­ry, and con­cern over ‘How are peo­ple view­ing me,’ ‘Some­one said some­thing bad about me’ — and you get so upset about it — is wast­ed time and ener­gy.” In the view of Mar­cus Aure­lius, “your only focus should be on get­ting bet­ter at what you’re doing. Focus on what you’re doing, get bet­ter at what you’re doing. Every­thing else is a com­plete waste of time.” It’s not hard to under­stand why such a world­view would appeal to the man Sarah Sil­ver­man, in the Times Mag­a­zine Pro­file, calls “the ulti­mate crafts­man” among come­di­ans.\nIn addi­tion to the Med­i­ta­tions, Sein­feld also relies on the prac­tice of actu­al med­i­ta­tion, which he cred­its with pro­vid­ing him both the phys­i­cal and men­tal ener­gy nec­es­sary to keep pur­su­ing his goals into his sev­en­ties. “Med­i­ta­tion is like if I said to you, ‘I’m going to need you to get in the hot tub once a day, and just sit there for five min­utes. Could you do that? That’s pret­ty easy. Med­i­ta­tion is even eas­i­er than that.” Exer­cise is the oppo­site, since it “takes more effort than any­thing,” but it’s become just as impor­tant a part of his life, the three keys to whose suc­cess he enu­mer­ates as fol­lows: “Tran­scen­den­tal med­i­ta­tion, lift weights, espres­so.” One likes to imag­ine that, had Mar­cus Aure­lius installed a Mar­zoc­co up on Pala­tine Hill, he’d have enjoyed a few shots through­out the day too.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMar­cus Aure­lius’ 9 Rules for Liv­ing a Sto­ic Life\nWhat’s the Deal with Pop Tarts?

    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 30th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nGrant­ed access to a time machine, few of us would pre­sum­ably opt first for the expe­ri­ence of skull surgery by the Incas. Yet our chances of sur­vival would be bet­ter than if we under­went the same pro­ce­dure 400 years lat­er, at least if it took place on a Civ­il War bat­tle­field. In both fif­teenth-cen­tu­ry Peru and the nine­teenth-cen­tu­ry Unit­ed States, sur­geons were per­form­ing a lot of trepa­na­tion, or removal of a por­tion of the skull. Since the Neolith­ic peri­od, indi­vid­u­als had been trepanned for a vari­ety of rea­sons, some of which now sound more med­ical­ly com­pelling than oth­ers, but the Incan civ­i­liza­tion took it to anoth­er lev­el of fre­quen­cy, and indeed sophis­ti­ca­tion.\nAny­one with an inter­est in the his­to­ry of tech­nol­o­gy would do well to study the Incas, who were remark­able in both what they devel­oped and what they did­n’t. Though there was no Incan alpha­bet, there was khipu, (or quipu), pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, a sys­tem of record-keep­ing that used noth­ing but knot­ted cords.\nThe Incas may not have had wheeled vehi­cles or mechan­i­cal devices as we know them today, but they did have pre­ci­sion mason­ry, an exten­sive road sys­tem, advanced water man­age­ment for agri­cul­tur­al and oth­er uses, high-qual­i­ty tex­tiles, and plant-derived anti­sep­tic — some­thing more than a lit­tle use­ful if you also hap­pen to be cut­ting a lot of holes in peo­ple’s skulls.\nStudy­ing the his­to­ry of trepa­na­tion, neu­rol­o­gist David Kush­n­er, along with bioar­chae­ol­o­gists John Ver­a­no and Anne Titel­baum, exam­ined more than 600 Peru­vian skulls dat­ing from between 400 BC and the mid-six­teenth-cen­tu­ry, which marked the end of the Incans’ 133-year-long run. As Sci­ence’s Lizzie Wade reports, the old­est evi­dence shows an unen­vi­able 40% sur­vival rate, but the sur­gi­cal tech­nique evolved over time: by the Inca era, the num­ber ris­es to between 75% and 83%, as against 46% to 56% in Civ­il War mil­i­tary hos­pi­tals. Some Incan skulls even show signs of hav­ing under­gone up to sev­en suc­cess­ful trepa­na­tions — or non-fatal ones, at any rate. Though that ven­er­a­ble form of surgery may no longer be prac­ticed, mod­ern neu­ro­sur­geons today use tech­niques based on the same prin­ci­ples. Should we find our­selves in need of their ser­vices, we’ll no doubt pre­fer to keep our dis­tance from the time machine.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nDis­cov­er Khipu, the Ancient Incan Record & Writ­ing Sys­tem Made Entire­ly of Knots\nBehold the Medieval Wound Man: The Poor Soul Who Illus­trat­ed the Injuries a Per­son Might Receive Through War, Acci­dent or Dis­ease\nJazz Musi­cian Plays Acoustic Gui­tar While Under­go­ing Brain Surgery, Help­ing Doc­tors Mon­i­tor Their Progress\nArti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence & Drones Uncov­er 303 New Naz­ca Lines in Peru\nHow the “First Pho­to­jour­nal­ist,” Math­ew Brady, Shocked the Nation with Pho­tos from the Civ­il War\nDown­load 100,000+ Images From The His­to­ry of Med­i­cine, All Free Cour­tesy of The Well­come Library\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Music |   \tJanuary 29th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf there’s a sil­ver lin­ing to our tumul­tuous times, it’s that musi­cians are reviv­ing the protest song, a tra­di­tion that has with­ered since the end of the Viet­nam War. Cre­dence Clear­wa­ter Revival’s “For­tu­nate Son,” Arlo Guthrie’s “Alice’s Restau­rant,” Jimi Hen­drix’s “Machine Gun”—these songs all took aim at the John­son and Nixon admin­is­tra­tions’ increas­ing­ly mis­guid­ed war effort. But it was Neil Young who wrote the most damn­ing protest song. When the Ohio Nation­al Guard shot and killed four stu­dents at Kent State in 1970, Young dis­ap­peared for a few hours and returned with the haunt­ing lyrics of “Ohio.”\nTin sol­diers and Nixon com­ing,\nWe’re final­ly on our own.\nThis sum­mer I hear the drum­ming,\nFour dead in Ohio.\nGot­ta get down to it\nSol­diers are cut­ting us down\nShould have been done long ago.\nWhat if you knew her\nAnd found her dead on the ground\nHow can you run when you know?\nWith his new song released this week, Bruce Spring­steen picks up this thread. “Streets Of Min­neapo­lis” doc­u­ments the mur­der of civil­ians in Min­neso­ta’s largest city. On Jan­u­ary 7, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Renee Good repeat­ed­ly in the head, leav­ing the moth­er of three dead. On Jan­u­ary 24, two fed­er­al agents fired at least 10 shots at Alex Pret­ti, killing the ICU nurse instant­ly. Days lat­er, the iden­ti­ty of these mur­der­ers remains hidden—something that news orga­ni­za­tions odd­ly don’t seem trou­bled by, almost as if we’re qui­et­ly accept­ing that we’re liv­ing in a police state. When was the last time Amer­i­can agents could wear masks before killing civil­ians, and then hide behind a veil of anonymi­ty after? Yeah, that’s nor­mal.\nOn social media, Spring­steen wrote: “I wrote this song on Sat­ur­day, record­ed it yes­ter­day and released it to you today in response to the state ter­ror being vis­it­ed on the city of Min­neapo­lis. It’s ded­i­cat­ed to the peo­ple of Min­neapo­lis, our inno­cent immi­grant neigh­bors and in mem­o­ry of Alex Pret­ti and Renee Good.” You can read the lyrics below.\nThrough the winter’s ice and cold\nDown Nicol­let Avenue\nA city aflame fought fire and ice\n‘Neath an occupier’s boots\nKing Trump’s pri­vate army from the DHS\nGuns belt­ed to their coats\nCame to Min­neapo­lis to enforce the law\nOr so their sto­ry goes\nAgainst smoke and rub­ber bul­lets\nBy the dawn’s ear­ly light\nCit­i­zens stood for jus­tice\nTheir voic­es ring­ing through the night\nAnd there were bloody foot­prints\nWhere mer­cy should have stood\nAnd two dead left to die on snow-filled streets\nAlex Pret­ti and Renee Good\nOh our Min­neapo­lis, I hear your voice\nSinging through the bloody mist\nWe’ll take our stand for this land\nAnd the stranger in our midst\nHere in our home they killed and roamed\nIn the win­ter of ’26\nWe’ll remem­ber the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Min­neapo­lis\nTrump’s fed­er­al thugs beat up on\nHis face and his chest\nThen we heard the gun­shots\nAnd Alex Pret­ti lay in the snow, dead\nTheir claim was self defense, sir\nJust don’t believe your eyes\nIt’s our blood and bones\nAnd these whis­tles and phones\nAgainst Miller and Noem’s dirty lies\nOh our Min­neapo­lis, I hear your voice\nCry­ing through the bloody mist\nWe’ll remem­ber the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Min­neapo­lis\nNow they say they’re here to uphold the law\nBut they tram­ple on our rights\nIf your skin is black or brown my friend\nYou can be ques­tioned or deport­ed on sight\nIn chants of ICE out now\nOur city’s heart and soul per­sists\nThrough bro­ken glass and bloody tears\nOn the streets of Min­neapo­lis\nOh our Min­neapo­lis, I hear your voice\nSinging through the bloody mist\nHere in our home they killed and roamed\nIn the win­ter of ’26\nWe’ll take our stand for this land\nAnd the stranger in our midst\nWe’ll remem­ber the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Min­neapo­lis\nWe’ll remem­ber the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Min­neapo­lis\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nLeg­endary Protest Songs from Wood­stock: Hen­drix, Jef­fer­son Air­plane, Coun­try Joe & More Per­form Protest Songs Dur­ing the Music Fes­ti­val That Launched 50 Years Ago This Week\nDavid Byrne Curates a Playlist of Great Protest Songs Writ­ten Over the Past 60 Years: Stream Them Online\nThe Pow­er­ful Mes­sages That Woody Guthrie & Pete Seeger Inscribed on Their Gui­tar & Ban­jo: “This Machine Kills Fas­cists” and “This Machine Sur­rounds Hate and Forces it to Sur­ren­der”\nNina Simone’s Live Per­for­mances of Her Poignant Civ­il Rights Protest Songs\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nRegina Silveira has spent the better part of three decades considering the relationship between media and meaning, particularly as it relates to Latin America. Based in São Paulo, Silveira is a pioneer of Brazilian conceptual art who is known for utilizing light, installation, and photos to consider how images circulate and tell stories. One of her projects working in this vein is Latin American Puzzle, a series that assembles sprawling visual narratives like jigsaws.\nFirst presented in 1997, “To Be Continued…” features 100 black-and-white reproductions of photos, newspaper clippings, propaganda, advertisements, and more. Silveira nests each image into an oversized puzzle piece, which cuts off faces and scenes to leave fragments of pop culture icons, flora and fauna, and even the occasional mugshot spliced next to one another. Rather than organizing pieces by time period, geography, or thematic context, these juxtapositions create what the artist calls “a patchwork quilt of entropic character” that leaves a more complicated view of Latin America.\n\n“To Be Continued…” is on view this month at Alexander Gray Associates alongside the latest iteration of the work, “Continued…” Together, the large-scale installations present Silveira’s evolving considerations of a region that continues to grapple with its post-colonial environment and unending interventions by world powers. \nBlack pieces and occasional white gaps suggest both loss and an opening for new additions, while the grooved edges seemingly allow for reconfiguration. Combined with titles that end in ellipses, the malleable compositions portray narratives that are always in flux.\nSee Latin American Puzzle through February 14 in New York. Find more from Silveira on her website.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation view of ‘Regina Silveira: Latin American Puzzle,’ Alexander Gray Associates, New York (2026)\n\t\n\t\n\t",

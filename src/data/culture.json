    "body": "\n\tin History, Literature, Technology |   \tDecember 2nd, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nMark Twain was, in the esti­ma­tion of many, the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca’s first tru­ly home­grown man of let­ters. And in keep­ing with what would be rec­og­nized as the can-do Amer­i­can spir­it, he could­n’t resist putting him­self forth now and again as a man of sci­ence — or, more prac­ti­cal­ly, a man of tech­nol­o­gy. Here on Open Cul­ture, we’ve pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured his patent­ed inven­tions (includ­ing a bet­ter bra strap), the type­writer of which he made pio­neer­ing use to write a book, and even the inter­net-pre­dict­ing sto­ry he wrote in 1898. Giv­en Twain’s incli­na­tions, his fame, and the time in which he lived, it may come as no sur­prise to hear that he also struck up a friend­ship with the much-roman­ti­cized inven­tor Niko­la Tes­la.\nAs it hap­pens, Tes­la had become a fan of Twain’s long before they met, hav­ing found solace in the Amer­i­can writer’s books pro­vid­ed dur­ing a long, near-fatal stretch of child­hood ill­ness. He cred­its his recov­ery with the laugh­ter that read­ing mate­r­i­al pro­vid­ed him, and one imag­ines see­ing life in the U.S. through Twain’s eyes played some part in his even­tu­al emi­gra­tion there.\nBy that point, Twain him­self was liv­ing in Europe, though his fre­quent vis­its to New York meant that he could drop by Tes­la’s lab and see how his lat­est exper­i­ments with elec­tric­i­ty were going. It was there, in 1894, that the two men took the pho­to­graph above, in which Twain holds a vac­u­um lamp engi­neered by Tes­la and pow­ered (out of frame) by the elec­tro­mag­net­ic coil that bears his name.\nAs Ian Har­vey writes at The Vin­tage News, “Tes­la was a sci­en­tist whose work large­ly revolved around elec­tric­i­ty; at that time, mak­ing your liv­ing as a sci­en­tist and inven­tor could often mean hav­ing to be some­what of a show­man,” a pres­sure Twain under­stood. His­to­ry has record­ed that Tes­la pro­vid­ed Twain with — in addi­tion to an elec­tric­i­ty-based con­sti­pa­tion cure that worked rather too well — advice against putting his mon­ey into an uncom­pet­i­tive auto­mat­ic type­set­ting machine that, unfor­tu­nate­ly, went unheed­ed. The one­time river­boat cap­tain went on to make an even more unsound invest­ment in a pow­der called Plas­mon, which promised to end world hunger. Per­haps Tes­la’s spir­i­tu­al descen­dants are to be found in today’s Sil­i­con Val­ley, invent­ing the future; Mark Twain’s cer­tain­ly are, under­writ­ing any num­ber of far-fetched schemes, if with far less of a sense of humor.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMark Twain Plays With Elec­tric­i­ty in Niko­la Tesla’s Lab (Pho­to, 1894)\nMark Twain Wrote the First Book Ever Writ­ten With a Type­writer\nMark Twain’s Patent­ed Inven­tions for Bra Straps and Oth­er Every­day Items\nMark Twain Pre­dicts the Inter­net in 1898: Read His Sci-Fi Crime Sto­ry, “From The ‘Lon­don Times’ in 1904”\nNiko­la Tesla’s Pre­dic­tions for the 21st Cen­tu­ry: The Rise of Smart Phones & Wire­less, The Demise of Cof­fee & More (1926/35)\nWhen David Bowie Became Niko­la Tes­la: Watch His Elec­tric Per­for­mance in The Pres­tige (2006)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tDecember 3rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPaul Thomas Ander­son­’s lat­est film, the loose Thomas Pyn­chon adap­ta­tion One Bat­tle After Anoth­er, serves up many a mem­o­rable scene. But for a cer­tain kind of cinephile, noth­ing — not the ter­ror­ist attacks, not the chas­es, not the swerves into askew com­e­dy — sticks in the mind quite so much as the moment in which Leonar­do diCapri­o’s stoned pro­tag­o­nist tunes in to a broad­cast of Gillo Pon­tecor­vo’s The Bat­tle of Algiers. First released in 1966 (and cur­rent­ly free to watch on YouTube in cer­tain regions), that pic­ture has now been a main­stay of film-stud­ies syl­labi long enough that one for­gets just how much it would have star­tled its ear­li­est view­ers, more than a few of whom had no idea whether they were watch­ing a war movie or gen­uine Alger­ian War news­reel footage.\n\n\n\t\n\nSome of those view­ers includ­ed major film­mak­ers, not least Stan­ley Kubrick, who lat­er described all films as “false doc­u­men­taries,” and Pon­tecor­vo’s work as an espe­cial­ly impres­sive exam­ple there­of. Antho­ny Frewin, who worked as Kubrick­’s per­son­al assis­tant, remem­bers the direc­tor telling him that “I could­n’t real­ly under­stand what cin­e­ma was capa­ble of with­out see­ing The Bat­tle of Algiers. He was still enthus­ing about it pri­or to his death.”\nThe new Stu­dioBinder video at the top of the post also includes tes­ti­mo­ni­als from a host of oth­er auteurs includ­ing Wern­er Her­zog, Steven Soder­bergh, Oliv­er Stone, Alfon­so Cuarón, Spike Lee, Mira Nair, and Christo­pher Nolan.\n\n\n\t\n\nKathryn Bigelow — who, as the direc­tor of pic­tures like The Hurt Lock­er and Zero Dark Thir­ty, knows some­thing about spin­ning recent mil­i­tary con­flicts into com­pelling, real­is­tic thrillers — pulled The Bat­tle of Algiers from the shelves on her vis­it to the Cri­te­ri­on Col­lec­tion’s clos­et. She calls it “prob­a­bly my favorite movie of all time,” adding that “the metronome of ten­sion is almost insuf­fer­able, but I say that as a com­pli­ment.” A young Roger Ebert, in his con­tem­po­rary review of the film, warned that it “may be a deep­er film expe­ri­ence than many audi­ences can with­stand: too cyn­i­cal, too true, too cru­el and too heart­break­ing. It is about the Alger­ian war, but those not inter­est­ed in Alge­ria may sub­sti­tute anoth­er war.”\n\n\n\t\n\nSuch a “uni­ver­sal frame of ref­er­ence” is also com­mon to the oth­er high­lights of the Ital­ian neo­re­al­ist move­ment, which also include Rober­to Rossellini’s Rome, Open City, Vit­to­rio De Sica’s Bicy­cle Thieves, and Luchi­no Vis­con­ti’s The Earth Trem­bles, with their stark black-and-white cin­e­matog­ra­phy, their real, often still war-torn loca­tions, and their most­ly non-pro­fes­sion­al actors. Despite their ven­er­a­bil­i­ty, these films can remind even us twen­ty-first-cen­tu­ry view­ers who feel as if we’ve seen it all just how much cin­e­mat­ic poten­tial remains untapped. As Paul Thomas Ander­son puts it, “It’s always a good idea to watch The Bat­tle of Algiers again, just as a cin­e­mat­ic exer­cise to get you excit­ed” — no alter­ation of con­scious­ness required before­hand.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nStan­ley Kubrick’s List of Top 10 Films: The First and Only List He Ever Cre­at­ed\nFear and Desire: Stan­ley Kubrick’s First and Least-Seen Fea­ture Film (1953)\nHow Post­war Ital­ian Cin­e­ma Cre­at­ed La Dolce Vita and Then the Paparazzi\nAni­mat­ed Intro­duc­tions to Edward Said’s Ground­break­ing Book Ori­en­tal­ism\nThe Film Music of Ennio Mor­ri­cone (RIP) Beau­ti­ful­ly Per­formed by the Dan­ish Nation­al Sym­pho­ny Orches­tra Play: “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” & Much More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Life |   \tDecember 3rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nWith the old joke about every gen­er­a­tion think­ing they invent­ed sex, List­verse brings us the papyrus above, the old­est depic­tion of sex on record. Paint­ed some­time in the Rames­side Peri­od (1292–1075 B.C.E.), the frag­ments above—called the “Turin Erot­ic Papyrus” because of their “dis­cov­ery” in the Egypt­ian Muse­um of Turin, Italy—only hint at the frank ver­sions of ancient sex they depict (see a graph­ic par­tial recon­struc­tion at the bot­tom of the post—probably NSFW). The num­ber of sex­u­al posi­tions the papyrus illustrates—twelve in all—“fall some­where between impres­sive­ly acro­bat­ic and unnerv­ing­ly ambi­tious,” one even involv­ing a char­i­ot. Apart from its obvi­ous fer­til­i­ty sym­bols, writes archae­ol­o­gy blog Ancient Peo­ples, the papyrus also has a “humor­ous and/or satir­i­cal” pur­pose, and prob­a­bly a male audience—evidenced, per­haps, by its resem­blance to 70’s porn: “the men are most­ly unkempt, unshaven, and bald­ing […], where­as the women are the ide­al of beau­ty in Egypt.”\n\nIn fact the erot­ic por­tion of the papyrus was only made pub­lic in the 1970s. Egyp­tol­o­gists have known of the larg­er scroll, tech­ni­cal­ly called “Papyrus Turin 55001” since the 1820s. On the right side of the papyrus (above) ani­mals per­form var­i­ous human tasks as musi­cians, sol­diers, and arti­sans. The artist meant this piece too as satire, Ancient Peo­ples alleges. Like ancient Roman and Greek satir­i­cal art, the ani­mals may rep­re­sent sup­posed arche­typ­al aspects of the artists and trades­men shown here. All very inter­est­ing, but of course the real inter­est in Papyrus Turin 55001 is of the pruri­ent vari­ety.\nEgyp­tol­ogy stu­dent Car­o­line Sea­wright points us toward the rather lurid His­to­ry Chan­nel seg­ment on the erot­ic papyrus, which calls the pic­tures “one of the most shock­ing sets of images in the whole of antiq­ui­ty.” Against a per­cep­tion of ancient Egyp­tians as “but­toned-up and repressed,” the video, and Sea­wright, detail the ways in which the cul­ture rev­eled in a styl­ized rit­u­al sex­u­al­i­ty quite dif­fer­ent from our own lim­it­ed mores.\nSacred tem­ple pros­ti­tutes held a priv­i­leged posi­tion and mytho­log­i­cal nar­ra­tives incor­po­rat­ed unbi­ased descrip­tions of homo­sex­u­al­i­ty and trans­gen­derism. Ancient Egyp­tians even expect­ed to have sex after death, attach­ing fab­ri­cat­ed organs to their mum­mies. The above applies main­ly to a cer­tain class of Egypt­ian. As archae­ol­o­gist David O’Connor points out, the Turin Erot­ic Papyrus’ high “artis­tic mer­it” marks it as with­in the prove­nance of “an elite own­er and audi­ence.” You can find more detailed images from a dif­fer­ent recon­struc­tion of the erot­ic papyrus here.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAn Ancient Egypt­ian Home­work Assign­ment from 1800 Years Ago: Some Things Are Tru­ly Time­less\n3,200-Year-Old Egypt­ian Tablet Records Excus­es for Why Peo­ple Missed Work: “The Scor­pi­on Bit Him,” “Brew­ing Beer” & More\nSex and Alco­hol in Medieval Times: A Look into the Plea­sures of the Mid­dle Ages\nSci­en­tists Dis­cov­er that Ancient Egyp­tians Drank Hal­lu­cino­genic Cock­tails from 2,300 Year-Old Mug\n\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhile Coca-Cola decided to run with generative AI for its animated Christmas ad—a holiday tradition the brand is known for—Apple leaned into the world of practical effects with a troupe of woodland puppets. Titled “A Critter Carol” and featuring the latest iPhone model, the short film takes its cues from compassion, creativity, and community.\nThe quirky, happy-go-lucky song is inspired by Flight of the Conchords’ tune “Friends” and features a ragtag group of woodland critters who happen to run across an iPhone someone dropped during a hike.\n\n\n\n“For me, it was the story of how one act of kindness can bring…lots of different people together, and I think that’s a nice message,” says director Mark Molloy in the making-of video, which you can also see below.\nMolloy was particularly interested in the timeless craft of puppetry and an emphasis on the handmade, not only in the making of the characters and miniature forest set but in the hands-on process of filming and operating the puppets, which involved several puppeteers working simultaneously.\n“There’s a reality to how we built these creatures, but also how we brought them to life, that is imperfect,” Molloy says. These so-called imperfections, however, comprise the inventive magic that makes the goofy, anthropomorphized cast of characters so relatable. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The only two words you want to hear when you’re ravenous and seated at the laminate counter of a roadside diner.\nArtist Adrienna Matzeg takes this highly anticipated call as the basis for a new trio of punch-needle works. Through nostalgic embroidered tableaux, she whips up melty grilled cheese, waffles with a pat of butter, and a banana split with puffs of cream and not just one, but three cherries nested on top. \nDetail of “Sweet as Suga'”\nLike much of her earlier work, Order Up captures Matzeg’s keen interest in nostalgia and the welcome discoveries of a long car ride. “Inspired by North American roadside diners and late-night stops, each piece captures the essence of a greasy spoon,” she adds.\nWhether a cheap paper napkin or bottomless cup of coffee, the objects all appear to pop up from the delicately mottled backdrops, the painstakingly stitched shadows hugging their forms. \nFind more about Matzeg’s work on Tacit Collective, and keep up with her practice on Instagram.\nDetail of “House Special”\n“Sundae Best”\nDetail of “Sundae Best”\n“Sweet as Suga'”\n“House Special”\n“Sundae Best”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Joy Divi­sion’s debut <em>Unknown Plea­sures </em>sold only 20,000 copies in its ini­tial peri­od of release, but the T‑shirt embla­zoned with its cov­er art — an image of radio waves ema­nat­ing from a pul­sar tak­en from an astron­o­my ency­clo­pe­dia<i> </i>— has long since con­sti­tut­ed a com­mer­cial-semi­otic empire unto itself. That speaks to the vast sub­cul­tur­al influ­ence of the band, despite their only hav­ing been active from 1976 to 1980. When we speak of the genre of post-punk, we speak, in large part, of Joy Divi­sion and the artists they influ­enced.</p>\n<p>Less than a year after the 1979 release of <em>Unknown Plea­sures</em>, Joy Divi­sion’s lead singer Ian Cur­tis com­mit­ted sui­cide. The band had already record­ed <em>Clos­er</em>, their sec­ond and last album (at least before the sub­se­quent, more suc­cess­ful ref­or­ma­tion as New Order). Scant though it may be, their stu­dio discog­ra­phy has only drawn more and more crit­i­cal acclaim over the decades.</p>\n<p>Still, fans who weren’t around to wit­ness the rise of Joy Divi­sion first-hand will sus­pect they’ve missed out on some­thing essen­tial. “Live, Joy Divi­sion were heavy,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/18/the-eternal-influence-of-joy-division-moby-killers-jon-savage-zia-anger\">remem­bers band his­to­ri­an Jon Sav­age</a>. “Per­form­ers — and David Bowie is a good exam­ple – know exact­ly what to give and what to with­hold, but Ian Cur­tis didn’t have that stage­craft. He just came on and gave every­thing.”</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/MxW4SSGB-kc?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>That sort of inten­si­ty, Sav­age adds, is “not infi­nite­ly repro­ducible”; even at the time, it seems that those who wit­nessed Joy Divi­sion in con­cert under­stood that their pecu­liar­ly com­pelling ener­gy was dri­ving toward some kind of final com­bus­tion. You can get a taste of it in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8yQE4S6pQ\">the col­lec­tion of the group’s every tele­vised per­for­mance</a>, orig­i­nal­ly aired on BBC2 and Grana­da TV in 1978 and 1979, <span>at the top of the post; just above</span>, we have a 70-minute <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxW4SSGB-kc\">com­pi­la­tion of all their filmed live shows</a>.

The close­ness pro­duced a keen appre­ci­a­tion for ani­mal behav­ior that informs the folk tales of every con­ti­nent and the pop­u­lar texts of every reli­gion. Our delight in ani­mal sto­ries sur­vives in children’s books, but in grown-up lan­guage, ani­mal com­par­isons tend to be nasty and dehu­man­iz­ing. The demean­ing adjec­tive “bes­tial” con­veys a typ­i­cal atti­tude not only toward peo­ple we don’t like, but toward the ani­mal world as well. Orwell’s <em>Ani­mal Farm</em> and Kafka’s <em>Meta­mor­pho­sis</em> have become the stan­dard ref­er­ences for mod­ern ani­mal alle­go­ry.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08215727/aberdeen2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08215727/aberdeen2.webp 1400w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08215727/aberdeen2-360x174.webp 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08215727/aberdeen2-1024x495.webp 1024w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08215727/aberdeen2-240x116.webp 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08215727/aberdeen2-768x371.webp 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Ear­ly lit­er­a­ture shows us a range of dif­fer­ent atti­tudes, where ani­mals are treat­ed as equals, with char­ac­ter traits both good and bad, or as noble mes­sen­gers of a god or gods rather than live­stock, mov­ing scenery, or exploitable resources.</p>\n<p>We might refer in an east­ern con­text to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/jataka.html\">Jata­ka Tales</a>, fables of the Buddha’s many rebirths in the human and ani­mal worlds that pro­vide their read­ers with moral lessons.

Now, the Uni­ver­si­ty of Aberdeen has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/bestiary/\">dig­i­tized the text and made it freely avail­able to read­ers online</a>. Begin­ning with the key cre­ation sto­ries from the book of Gen­e­sis, the book then dives into its descrip­tions of ani­mals, begin­ning with the lion, the pard (pan­ther), and the ele­phant.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice that these are not ani­mals that your typ­i­cal medieval Euro­pean read­er would have encoun­tered. One impor­tant dif­fer­ence between the bes­tiary and the fable is that the for­mer draws many of its beasts from hearsay, con­jec­ture, or pure fic­tion. But the intent is part­ly the same. These “were teach­ing tools,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/338199/a-lavishly-illuminated-medieval-bestiary-goes-online/\">notes Claire Voon at </a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/338199/a-lavishly-illuminated-medieval-bestiary-goes-online/\">Hyper­al­ler­gic</a>, and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/bestiary/\">Aberdeen Bes­tiary</a> con­tains illus­trat­ed “lengthy tales of moral behav­ior.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08220008/Bestiary_combined.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08220008/Bestiary_combined.jpg 730w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08220008/Bestiary_combined-360x255.jpg 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2025/10/08220008/Bestiary_combined-240x170.jpg 240w\" /></p>\n<p>Like the sto­ries of Aesop, the bes­tiary presents impor­tant lessons, mix­ing in the fab­u­lous with the nat­u­ral­ist. As Voon describes the Aberdeen Bes­tiary:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The illus­tra­tions are impres­sive­ly var­ied, depict­ing com­mon ani­mals from tiny ants to ele­phants, as well as fan­tas­tic beasts, from the leocro­ta to the phoenix. Even the moral qual­i­ties of the hum­ble sea urchin are hon­ored with para­graphs of dis­cus­sion. Beyond this array of crea­tures, the bes­tiary details the appear­ances and qual­i­ties of var­i­ous trees, gems, and humans. Some of these may seem com­i­cal to 21st-cen­tu­ry eyes: a swarm of bees, for instance, resem­bles an order­ly line of shut­tle­cocks stream­ing into their hives. Yet oth­er paint­ings are impres­sive for their near-accu­ra­cy, such as one image of a bat that shows how its mem­bra­nous wings con­nect its fin­gers, legs, and tail. All of these rich details would have helped read­ers bet­ter under­stand the nat­ur­al world as it was defined at the time of the book’s cre­ation. </em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Incred­i­bly ornate and bear­ing the marks of dozens of scrib­al hands,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/bestiary/\"> the book</a>, his­to­ri­ans believe, was orig­i­nal­ly pro­duced for a wide audi­ence, then tak­en by Henry’s librar­i­ans from a dis­solved monastery. Nev­er ful­ly com­plet­ed, it remained in the Roy­al Library for 100 years after Hen­ry. “I doubt if the Tudor mon­archs took it out for a reg­u­lar read,” says Aberdeen Uni­ver­si­ty pro­fes­sor Jane Ged­des. Now an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/bestiary/\">open pub­lic doc­u­ment</a>, it returns to its “orig­i­nal pur­pose of edu­ca­tion,” writes Voon, “although for us, of course, it illu­mi­nates more about the past than the present.” See the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/bestiary/\">high res scans here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/10/02214213/Aberdeen-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/10/02214213/Aberdeen-3.jpg 720w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/10/02214213/Aberdeen-3-97x150.jpg 97w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/10/02214213/Aberdeen-3-194x300.jpg 194w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/10/02214213/Aberdeen-3-664x1024.jpg 664w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2017/10/02214213/Aberdeen-3-300x463.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Medieval Masterpiece, the <i>Book of Kells</i>, Is Now Digitized and Available Online\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/09/the-medieval-masterpiece-the-book-of-kells-is-now-digitized-and-available-online.html\">The Medieval Mas­ter­piece, the <i>Book of Kells</i>, Is Now Dig­i­tized and Avail­able Online</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Medieval Manuscript That Features “Yoda”, Killer Snails, Savage Rabbits & More: Discover <i>The Smithfield Decretals</i>\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/04/the-medieval-manuscript-that-features-yoda-killer-snails-mischievous-devils.html\">The Medieval Man­u­script That Fea­tures “Yoda”, Killer Snails, Sav­age Rab­bits & More: Dis­cov­er <i>The Smith­field Dec­re­tals</i></a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to How to Make a Medieval Manuscript: An Introduction in 7 Videos\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/05/how-to-make-a-medieval-manuscript-an-introduction-in-7-videos.html\">How to Make a Medieval Man­u­script: An Intro­duc­tion in 7 Videos</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to When Medieval Manuscripts Were Recycled & Used to Make the First Printed Books\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/11/when-medieval-manuscripts-were-recycled-used-to-make-the-first-printed-books.html\">When Medieval Man­u­scripts Were Recy­cled & Used to Make the First Print­ed Books</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>",

Or maybe relo­cat­ing for good? Amer­i­cans would do well, even 150 years hence, to attend to Mark Twain’s satir­i­cal account of U.S. trav­el­ers jour­ney­ing through Europe and Pales­tine, <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3176\">The Inno­cents Abroad</a></em>. The “Amer­i­cans who are paint­ed to pecu­liar advan­tage by Mr. Clements” (<em>sic</em>), as fel­low Amer­i­can satirist William Dean How­ells <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1869/12/the-innocents-abroad-or-the-new-pilgrims-progress/306508/\">wrote at the time</a>, still roam the Earth—including trav­el­ers like one who “told the Eng­lish offi­cers that a cou­ple of our gun­boats could come and knock Gibral­tar into the Mediter­ranean Sea.” The tact­less­ness and bel­liger­ence Twain skew­ered do not feel his­tor­i­cal­ly so far from home.</p>\n<p>Twain’s portraits—“somewhat car­i­ca­tured… or care­ful­ly and exact­ly done”—proved so pop­u­lar with read­ers that he fol­lowed up with an unof­fi­cial sequel, 1880s <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/119\">A Tramp Abroad</a></em>, a some­what more seri­ous fic­tion­al­ized trav­el­ogue of Amer­i­cans jour­ney­ing through Europe; this time but two, Twain and his friend “Har­ris.” In the pre­vi­ous book, com­plained How­ells, the read­er learns “next to noth­ing about the pop­u­la­tion of the cities and the char­ac­ter of the rocks in the dif­fer­ent local­i­ties.” Here, with­out his com­e­dy troupe of trav­el­ing com­pan­ions, Twain directs his focus out­ward with minute descrip­tions of his sur­round­ings. He is, as usu­al, supreme­ly curi­ous, often per­plexed, but most­ly delight­ed by his expe­ri­ences. Except when it comes to the food.</p>\n<p>Grow­ing “increas­ing­ly tired of an abun­dance of what he described as ‘fair-to-mid­dling’ food,” writes Lists of Note, Twain com­ments: “The num­ber of dish­es is suf­fi­cient; but then it is such a monot­o­nous vari­ety of UNSTRIKING dish­es […] Three or four months of this weary same­ness will kill the robustest appetite.” Hav­ing nev­er spent so long a time away, I can­not speak to Twain’s gus­ta­to­ry <em>ennui</em>, but I can relate, as no doubt can you, read­er, to miss­ing one or two famil­iar com­fort foods (as well as “sin­cere and capa­ble” ice water). Twain, per­haps not as adven­tur­ous an eater as he was a traveler—and in that sense also very much a mod­ern American—made “an enor­mous list of the foods he’d missed the most, of which were to be con­sumed when he arrived home.”</p>\n<p>The list, below, is itself a kind of trav­el­ogue, through the vari­eties of 19th cen­tu­ry Amer­i­can cui­sine, East, West, North, and South, includ­ing such del­i­ca­cies as “’Pos­sum” “Can­vas-back-duck from Bal­ti­more,” “Vir­ginia bacon, broiled,” “Prairie hens, from Illi­nois,”<em> </em>and “Brook trout, from Sier­ra Nevadas.” While we might pine for a region­al del­i­ca­cy or favorite processed food, Twain con­jured up in his mind’s gut a whole con­ti­nent of food to come home to. What kinds of food do you find your­self miss­ing when you trav­el? And how long a list might you find your­self mak­ing after sev­er­al months tramp­ing around in for­eign lands? Tell us in the com­ments sec­tion below. For now, here’s Twain’s list:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Radish­es. Baked apples, with cream</em><br />\n<em>Fried oys­ters; stewed oys­ters.

Known as <a href=\"https://samlingar.shm.se/object/2E03694E-17DC-4AA1-B1A4-0B80F2035283\" target=\"_blank\">armillary rings</a>, these deceptively simple gold creations can be worn on the finger like any other band, but when removed, they open up into a sphere made of several interconnecting circular bands operated by delicate hinges.</p>\n<p>Examples of armillary rings in the British Museum and the Swedish National Museums of History have been traced to Germany, made during the Late Renaissance as the study of astronomy reached new heights. In 1543, Copernicus essentially launched the scientific revolution when he claimed that the Earth rotates around the Sun, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>A few years later, Italian polymath <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei\" target=\"_blank\">Galileo Galilei</a>, known as a pioneer of observational astronomy, built a telescope powerful enough to, for the first time, observe the stars of the Milky Way, see Jupiter’s four largest satellites, and make out Saturn’s rings, among other discoveries.</p>\n<p>The historic gold rings are based on ancient astronomical instruments called <a href=\"https://www.hsm.ox.ac.uk/armillary-sphere\" target=\"_blank\">armillary spheres</a>, which emerged from the long-disproven theory that everything in the cosmos revolved around Earth. The designs, which were used since at least the 2nd century, place our planet at the center. A group of rings rotates on an axis, providing reference points for locating other celestial bodies. Separate bands correlate to the equator, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the revolution of the Sun—a ring which also represents the constellations of the Zodiac.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-4.jpeg\" alt=\"a photo of an armillary ring shown closed with the hinges visible inside\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-4.jpeg 1395w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-4-640x474.jpeg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-4-960x712.jpeg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-4-768x569.jpeg 768w\" /><figcaption>Photo by Nina Davis, Historical Museum/SHM</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-3.jpeg\" alt=\"a photo of an armillary ring with engraved symbols and Zodiac signs\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-3.jpeg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-3-640x639.jpeg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-3-960x959.jpeg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-3-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-3-768x767.jpeg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-3-1536x1534.jpeg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Photo by Helena Bonnevier, Historical Museum/SHM</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-6.jpg\" alt=\"a photo of an armillary ring with no ornamentation\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-6.jpg 1453w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-6-640x563.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-6-960x845.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-6-768x676.jpg 768w\" /><figcaption>Image © The Trustees of the British Museum</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-5.jpg\" alt=\"a photo of an armillary ring with engraved symbols and Zodiac signs\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-5-640x617.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-5-960x926.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-5-768x741.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-5-1536x1481.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Image © The Trustees of the British Museum</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-2.jpeg\" alt=\"a photo of an armillary ring with engraved symbols and Zodiac signs\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-2.jpeg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-2-640x580.jpeg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-2-960x871.jpeg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-2-768x697.jpeg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/armillary-2-1536x1393.jpeg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Photo by Helena Bonnevier, Historical Museum/SHM</figcaption></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>",

Often weathered and tumbled-looking, a series of handbags, purses, and helmets glimpse a wonderfully weird world.</p>\n<p>“I’m in the long process of faithfully recreating various artefacts from the world of Fliffmellington,” Puck tells Colossal. “Long-term, I will be making a book and short film, as well as an anthropological exhibition of the artefacts.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/puck-9.jpg\" alt=\"two sculptural handbags by Paolo Puck shaped like a radish and a pickle\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/puck-9.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/puck-9-640x576.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/puck-9-960x864.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/puck-9-768x692.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/puck-9-1536x1383.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>The artist aims to highlight the world of Fliffmellington through its material culture, which often features motifs of expressive or abstracted animals and absurdly large vegetables. The overall costumes reference personalities like the “Gherkin God” or an enigmatic, fantastical character named Celeste, who is associated with an organization called Jezilwik Grindlewax.</p>\n<p>Puck’s approach to making detailed, wearable pieces is through the lens of archaeologist and conservator, as if the objects have been carefully excavated or recovered from a forgotten place, shedding light on an unknown culture.</p>\n<p>Enter Puck’s uncanny world via the artist’s <a href=\"https://paolopuck.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fluff.faun\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, and find tutorials and making-of insights via <a href=\"https://fliffmellington.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Substack</a>.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>With a penchant for kaleidoscopic colors and whimsy, <a href=\"https://www.yenyenchou.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yen Yen Chou</a> renders a dainty, dreamlike environment in which pastel hues and subtle gradients rule. The artist, who lives between Taipei and Brooklyn, is drawn to dualities, particularly the relationships that emerge from “the ephemeral and the physical, the micro and the macro,” she says. At <a href=\"https://kishka.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Kishka Gallery & Library</a>, Chou’s presentation of two modes of working—watercolors on paper and epoxy clay reliefs—conjures the magic of polarities.</p>\n<p><em>An Ever Changing View</em>, as its name suggests, takes transformation as its root. Water droplets recur throughout the works, descending from a long, thin line into a swirling pool in “Rippling,” for example, and appearing as anthropomorphic, dozing characters in “Leaves of Becoming.” While suspended on panel or paper, these forms connote movement, as they’ll eventually evaporate or combine with a larger body. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/yen-yen-1.jpg\" alt=\"a light blue sculptural relief by Yen Yen Chu of a straight drizzle of water droplets into a larger swirling pool\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/yen-yen-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/yen-yen-1-640x948.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/yen-yen-1-960x1422.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/yen-yen-1-768x1138.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/yen-yen-1-1037x1536.jpg 1037w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/yen-yen-1-1382x2048.jpg 1382w\" /><figcaption>“Rippling” (2025), acrylic and epoxy clay on wooden panel, 37 ½ x 25 inches</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For now, though, she depicts a whimsical world on the verge of possibility. “This new body of work continues my exploration of transformation and interconnectedness in everyday life. I’ve been thinking about dualities…and how these relationships shape the way we experience life, through our thoughts, perceptions, and emotions,” she writes.</p>\n<p><em>An Ever Changing View</em> is open through November 22 in White River Junction, Vermont.

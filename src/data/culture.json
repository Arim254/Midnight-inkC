    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nHere’s anoth­er thing you can cred­it Thomas Jef­fer­son with: being the first known Amer­i­can to record an ice cream recipe. It’s one of 10 sur­viv­ing recipes writ­ten by the found­ing father.\nAccord­ing to Monticello.org, ice cream began appear­ing “in French cook­books start­ing in the late 17th cen­tu­ry, and in Eng­lish-lan­guage cook­books in the ear­ly 18th cen­tu­ry.” And there “are accounts of ice cream being served in the Amer­i­can colonies as ear­ly as 1744.” Jef­fer­son like­ly tast­ed his fair share of the dessert while liv­ing in France (1784–1789), and it con­tin­ued to be served at Mon­ti­cel­lo upon his return to Vir­ginia. By the first decade of the 19th cen­tu­ry, ice cream became increas­ing­ly com­mon in cook­books pub­lished through­out the U.S.\nYou can see the entire recipe for Jef­fer­son­’s vanil­la ice cream here, and read a tran­script below.\n2. bot­tles of good cream.\n6. yolks of eggs.\n1/2 lb. sug­ar\nmix the yolks & sug­ar\nput the cream on a fire in a casse­role, first putting in a stick of Vanil­la.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off & pour it gen­tly into the mix­ture of eggs & sug­ar.\nstir it well.\nput it on the fire again stir­ring it thor­ough­ly with a spoon to pre­vent it’s stick­ing to the casse­role.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off and strain it thro’ a tow­el.\nput it in the Sabottiere[12]\nthen set it in ice an hour before it is to be served. put into the ice a hand­ful of salt.\nput salt on the cov­er­lid of the Sabotiere & cov­er the whole with ice.\nleave it still half a quar­ter of an hour.\nthen turn the Sabot­tiere in the ice 10 min­utes\nopen it to loosen with a spat­u­la the ice from the inner sides of the Sabotiere.\nshut it & replace it in the ice\nopen it from time to time to detach the ice from the sides\nwhen well tak­en (prise) stir it well with the Spat­u­la.\nput it in moulds, justling it well down on the knee.\nthen put the mould into the same buck­et of ice.\nleave it there to the moment of serv­ing it.\nto with­draw it, immerse the mould in warm water, turn­ing it well till it will come out & turn it into a plate\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe First Amer­i­can Cook­book: Sam­ple Recipes from Amer­i­can Cook­ery (1796)\nLeo Tolstoy’s Fam­i­ly Recipe for Mac and Cheese\nErnest Hemingway’s Favorite Ham­burg­er Recipe\nThe Recipes of Icon­ic Authors: Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath, Roald Dahl, the Mar­quis de Sade & More\nMoMA’s Artists’ Cook­book (1978) Reveals the Meals of Sal­vador Dalí, Willem de Koon­ing, Andy Warhol, Louise Bour­geois & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nHow to Actu­al­ly Cook Sal­vador Dali’s Sur­re­al­ist Recipes: Cray­fish, Prawns, and Spit­ted Eggs\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Books |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImag­ine you could talk to Hierony­mus Bosch, the authors of the Book of Rev­e­la­tion, or of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script—a bizarre 15th cen­tu­ry text writ­ten in an uncrack­able code; that you could solve cen­turies-old mys­ter­ies by ask­ing them, “what were you think­ing?” You might be dis­ap­point­ed to hear them say, as does Lui­gi Ser­afi­ni, author and illus­tra­tor of the Codex Seraphini­anus, “At the end of the day [it’s] sim­i­lar to the Rorschach inkblot test. You see what you want to see. You might think it’s speak­ing to you, but it’s just your imag­i­na­tion.”\nIf you were a long­time devo­tee of an intense­ly sym­bol­ic, myth­ic text, you might refuse to believe this. It must mean some­thing, fans of the Codex have insist­ed since the book’s appear­ance in 1981.\nIt shares many sim­i­lar­i­ties with the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, save its rel­a­tive­ly recent vin­tage and liv­ing author: both the Seraphini­anus and the Voyn­ich seem to be com­pendi­ums of an oth­er­world­ly nat­ur­al sci­ence and art, and both are writ­ten in a whol­ly invent­ed lan­guage.\n\nSer­afi­ni tells Wired he thinks Voyn­ich is a fake. “The Holy Roman Emper­or Rudolf II loved ancient man­u­scripts; some­body swin­dled him and spread the rumor that it was orig­i­nal. The idea of made-up lan­guages is not new at all.” As for his own made-up lan­guage in the Codex, he avers, “I always said that there is no mean­ing behind the script; it’s just a game.” But it is not a hoax. Though he hasn’t mind­ed the mon­ey from the book’s cult pop­u­lar­i­ty, he cre­at­ed the book, he says, “try­ing to reach out to my fel­low peo­ple, just like blog­gers do.” It is, he says, “the prod­uct of a gen­er­a­tion that chose to con­nect and cre­ate a net­work, rather than kill each oth­er in wars like their fathers did.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe Codex, writes Abe Books, who made the short video review above, is “essen­tial­ly an ency­clo­pe­dia about an alien world that clear­ly reflects our own, each chap­ter appears to deal with key facets of this sur­re­al place, includ­ing flo­ra, fau­na, sci­ence, machines, games and archi­tec­ture.” That’s only a guess giv­en the unin­tel­li­gi­ble lan­guage.\nThe illus­tra­tions seem to draw from Bosch, Leonar­do da Vin­ci, and the medieval trav­el­ogue as much as from the sur­re­al­ism of con­tem­po­rary Euro­pean artists like Fan­tas­tic Plan­et ani­ma­tor René Laloux.\n\nSer­afi­ni has been delight­ed to see an exten­sive inter­net com­mu­ni­ty coa­lesce around the book, and has had his fun with it. He “now states,” writes Dan­ger­ous Minds, “that a stray white cat that joined him while he cre­at­ed the Codex in Rome in the 1970s was actu­al­ly the real author, tele­path­i­cal­ly guid­ing Ser­afi­ni as he drew and ‘wrote.’” You can now, thanks to a recent, rel­a­tive­ly afford­able edi­tion pub­lished by Riz­zoli, pur­chase your copy of the Codex. Buy now, I’d say. First edi­tions of the book now fetch upwards of $6000, and its pop­u­lar­i­ty shows no sign of slow­ing.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:  \nA Dig­i­tal Archive of Hierony­mus Bosch’s Com­plete Works: Zoom In & Explore His Sur­re­al Art\nExplore a Dig­i­tized Edi­tion of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, “the World’s Most Mys­te­ri­ous Book”\nCarl Jung’s Hand-Drawn, Rarely-Seen Man­u­script The Red Book\nThe Foot-Lick­ing Demons & Oth­er Strange Things in a 1921 Illus­trat­ed Man­u­script from Iran\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

Co-curated by Kate Kraczon, Director of Exhibitions and Chief Curator of the Brown Arts Institute (BAI)/The Bell, and Associate Curator Thea Quiray Tagle, PhD, this show marks the project’s only presentation in the United States. It’s on view in Providence, Rhode Island, through May 31.Drawing on interviews with former political prisoners recorded on location in Palestine, Prisoners of Love: Until the Sun of Freedom explores poetry, music, and other creative practices as tools of collective survival, resistance, and remembrance within global systems of incarceration. Abbas and Abou-Rahme’s work is rooted in what they describe as the construction of a “vast counter-archive” that documents Palestinian life and political struggle, which cannot be captured by official or institutional archives.The immersive sound and video installation projects moving images onto surfaces of concrete, fabric, and weathered steel — materials that echo the architecture of prisons and other spaces of confinement. At the center of the installation is “Enemy of the Sun” (1970), a poem by acclaimed Palestinian poet Samih Al-Qasim. Found handwritten in the revolutionary George Jackson’s cell following his 1971 murder in San Quentin Prison, the poem was misattributed to him by the Black Panther newspaper, and this “mistake” remains in popular consciousness. Today, “Enemy of the Sun” survives as a poignant artifact of historical and continuing solidarity between political prisoners in Palestine and the United States.The show was commissioned by Kraczon in 2020, with Quiray Tagle joining the project in 2023. It builds on the artists’ longstanding relationship with Kraczon, who produced their first US exhibition and catalogue in 2015 at the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania.Since 2020, Abbas and Abou-Rahme have been engaged with Brown University’s academic and student communities, including collaborations with the Center for Middle Eastern Studies and archival research at the John Hay Library’s Voices of Mass Incarceration in the United States project. In Spring 2025, the artists and Quiray Tagle co-taught a research-based course that extended  Abbas and Abou-Rahme’s inquiry while inviting students to explore family archives, community-based collections, and other hidden histories of mass incarceration. At The Bell, Prisoners of Love emerges not only as an exhibition, but as an evolving site of collective research, memory, and political imagination.To learn more, visit bell.brown.edu.\n                  \n                      \n                        Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Sponsored\n                      \n                      \n                        Exhibition Announcement\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Mountbatten-Windsor, stripped of his royal title last October following allegations of his involvement with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking ring, was taken into custody on February 19 on suspicions of misconduct in public office outlined in the latest batch of released Epstein files.“He's Sweating Now,” read the impromptu wall text accompanying the guerrilla installation, pointing to the ex-Prince's 2019 claim that he was medically unable to perspire as he fervently denied having sex with the late alleged sex trafficking survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre, Epstein's primary accuser. Giuffre recalled that on the first night she was made to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor in 2001, while she was 17, they danced together at a nightclub in London where he allegedly sweated all over her. \n\nThough the scandal-studded former prince had been stripped of his titles over the allegations of sex abuse in connection to Epstein, Mountbatten-Windsor's Thursday arrest — on his 66th birthday at that — emerged following claims that he had shared confidential information with Epstein while serving as UK trade envoy. A photojournalist with Reuters captured the infamous snapshot of Mountbatten-Windsor in the back of a police vehicle, slouching with an ashen face with flash-red eyes and his fingers interlaced in front of him. “Seeing a disgusting abuser FINALLY face a bit of justice? That’s priceless,” read the Instagram post claiming credit for the action on Everyone Hates Elon's account. “We're sick of obscenely rich, powerful men thinking they can just do as they please,” another post by the campaign detailed. “So when he was arrested, we wanted to show ex-prince Andrew how the world will remember him.”Everyone Hates Elon is best known for extremely confrontational guerrilla billboards and bus station ads targeting billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Donald Trump's connection to Epstein. The campaign recently unfurled a massive photograph of Trump with Epstein at Windsor Castle and at the United States Capitol. Some commentators online noted that the Louvre was the perfect location for the intervention as Giuffre's memoir Nobody's Girl (2025), published posthumously after she took her own life in April 2025, begins with her revisiting the museum in 2021. The museum still hasn't replied to request's request for comment.  \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Prince Andrew\n                      \n                      \n                        Jeffrey Epstein\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Urban decay is the muse of the 2026 calendar, “Unknown Landmarks,” from strip malls in Highland Park to flower shops in Eagle Rock. Gordon Henderson, who goes under the pen name Nib Geebles, and Ali began collaborating via letters exchanged when they were 17. Collages, shells wrapped in envelopes, and surrealist postcards served as their first collective works, paralleling a sustained, decades-long partnership staking their practice in everyday Northeast Los Angeles. “The Happy Rose Flower Shop, Eagle Rock,” pen and paint on paper“California Donuts, Koreatown,” pen and paint on paperBoth view documenting and preservation as a central component of their work. Flipping through the calendar’s pages, Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard recede from view, replaced by often immigrant-owned or enduring local establishments. “It's transforming now, and there's gonna be a lot less of these mom and pop stores,” Henderson told Hyperallergic. “Stores that have a very personal expression, like handmade signs. It's still being done, and they still teach it, but it's valued less.”The month of May on the “Unknown Landmarks” calendar. (image courtesy Gordon Henderson and Abira Ali)The pieces’ loose lines and selective imprecision are complemented by made-up “holidays” scribbled into days on the calendar: “Rethink your cherished stereotypes,” one reads. Many of these holidays have persisted throughout the decades since the calendar’s inception in 1985, where both the messages and the medium itself testify to the mundane absurdity of the passage of time. “I was attracted to line drawings, and I liked the idea of it being subconscious-oriented,” Henderson said. “I developed this loose and free approach to drawing — I drew at first with a marker or a rapidograph, which was popular in the 1980s. But then, Abira said, ‘Why don't you try a dipping pen?’”“Taco Azteca Original, Glendale,” pen and paint on paper. The idea for the calendar project developed when Henderson was a child drawing monsters over the illustrations in his father’s chemist trade calendar. The first year, he produced 25 copies and sold all of them, encouraging his pursuit to capture both the architecturally compelling and the comical. Along with their creative practice, Ali works as an illustrator and Henderson as an announcer for NPR’s LAist, labeling himself as both an artist and entertainer. The pair distribute the calendars themselves amongst small businesses in the area, including North Figueroa Books, where they displayed pieces from the calendar for the past month. At their final showing, they promised the proceeds to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights based in Los Angeles (CHIRLA). \"Hill Eye Center in Chinatown\"Ali and Henderson see politics as integral to their calendar project, remaining protective of these establishments and the communities they serve. “We have to stand up for the place that we've lived, the city we love, we live in,” Ali said. Although described as an existentialist and slapstick art calendar, underlying the humor is both a commitment to collectivity and resistance to conformity. The artists view the act of observing as an act of care, incorporating these elements into the 2026 calendar and those to come. “This unknown landmark series’ goal really is to try to get people to just go out for walks and take a look at their neighborhood,” Hendrson said, “and see how interesting it is.”\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Los Angeles\n                      \n                      \n                        California\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

The exhibition Reimagine African American Art traces the evolution of African American culture, providing a powerful lens into the lives, achievements, and resilience of Black artists. Located in a central gallery adjacent to Diego Rivera’s iconic Detroit Industry Murals, the reinstalled galleries span nearly two centuries of artistic production — from the 1800s, when a small number of African Americans overcame tremendous obstacles to become professional artists, to the 1980s, when broader national and international recognition began to emerge.“These artists were working in the 18th century, and some even earlier,” says Valerie Mercer, Curator and Head of the DIA’s Center for African American Art. “African American history isn’t taught enough in schools. I’ve studied so much art history in my life — I received my undergraduate degree at New York University and my graduate degree at Harvard — and I’ve never had a course on African American art.”In 2001, Mercer joined the Detroit Institute of Arts as the first curator dedicated to African American art in an encyclopedic American museum. The DIA began collecting African American art in 1943, and the establishment of the Center for African American Art in 2000 further affirmed its long-term commitment to preserving and presenting this history. Today, the DIA holds one of the most significant collections of African American art in the country.Installation view of Reimagine African American Art at the Detroit Institute of ArtsFour dedicated galleries explore key historical movements such as the Harlem Renaissance, Social Realism, the Civil Rights era, and the Black Arts Movement across a wide range of media, like drawings, prints, photography, paintings, and sculpture.Featured artists include Robert S. Duncanson, Mary Edmonia Lewis, Aaron Douglas, Dox Thrash, Hale Woodruff, Hughie Lee-Smith, Allie McGhee, Wadsworth Jarrell, Vincent Smith, Bob Thompson, Charles Alston, Sam Gilliam, Edward Clark, Charles McGhee, Mavis Iona Pusey, Felrath Hines, and Alvin Loving.The galleries bring together centuries of artistic innovation, offering a deeper understanding of African American art and its central role in United States history. When the DIA’s newly reinstalled Contemporary galleries open later in 2026, African American art will be presented within a broader global context, alongside works by artists from Detroit and across Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe, and beyond.For more information, visit dia.org.Robert S.

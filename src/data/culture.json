    "body": "\n\tin History, Language |   \tOctober 14th, 2025  2 Comments\n\t\nAs schol­ars of ancient texts well know, the recon­struc­tion of lost sources can be a mat­ter of some con­tro­ver­sy. In the ancient Hebrew and less ancient Chris­t­ian Bib­li­cal texts, for exam­ple, crit­ics find the rem­nants of many pre­vi­ous texts, seem­ing­ly stitched togeth­er by occa­sion­al­ly care­less edi­tors. Those source texts exist nowhere in any phys­i­cal form, com­plete or oth­er­wise. They must be inferred from the traces they have left behind—signatures of dic­tion and syn­tax, styl­is­tic and the­mat­ic pre­oc­cu­pa­tions….\nSo it is with the study of ancient lan­guages, but since oral cul­tures far pre­date writ­ten ones, the search for lin­guis­tic ances­tors can take us back to the very ori­gins of human cul­ture, to times unre­mem­bered and unrecord­ed by any­one, and only dim­ly glimpsed through scant archae­o­log­i­cal evi­dence and observ­able aur­al sim­i­lar­i­ties between vast­ly dif­fer­ent lan­guages. So it was with the the­o­ret­i­cal devel­op­ment of Indo-Euro­pean as a lan­guage fam­i­ly, a slow process that took sev­er­al cen­turies to coa­lesce into the mod­ern lin­guis­tic tree we now know.\nThe obser­va­tion that San­skrit and ancient Euro­pean lan­guages like Greek and Latin have sig­nif­i­cant sim­i­lar­i­ties was first record­ed by a Jesuit mis­sion­ary to Goa, Thomas Stephens, in the six­teenth cen­tu­ry, but lit­tle was made of it until around 100 years lat­er. A great leap for­ward came in the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry when Ger­man lin­guist August Schle­ich­er, under the influ­ence of Hegel, pub­lished his Com­pendi­um of the Com­par­a­tive Gram­mar of the Indo-Euro­pean Lan­guages. There, Schle­ich­er made an exten­sive attempt at recon­struct­ing the com­mon ances­tor of all Indo-Euro­pean lan­guages, “Pro­to-Indo-Euro­pean,” or PIE, for short, thought to have orig­i­nat­ed some­where in East­ern Europe, though this sup­po­si­tion is spec­u­la­tive.\nTo pro­vide an exam­ple of what the lan­guage might have been like, Schle­ich­er made up a fable called “The Sheep and the Hors­es” as a “son­ic exper­i­ment.” The sto­ry has been used ever since, “peri­od­i­cal­ly updat­ed,” writes Eric Pow­ell at Archae­ol­o­gy, “to reflect the most cur­rent under­stand­ing of how this extinct lan­guage would have sound­ed when it was spo­ken some 6,000 years ago.” Hav­ing no access to any texts writ­ten in Pro­to-Indo-Euro­pean (which may or may not have exist­ed) nor, of course, to any speak­ers of the lan­guage, lin­guists dis­agree a good deal on what it should sound like; “no sin­gle ver­sion can be con­sid­ered defin­i­tive.”\nAnd yet, since Schleicher’s time, the the­o­ry has been con­sid­er­ably refined. At the top of the post, you can hear one such refine­ment based on work by UCLA pro­fes­sor H. Craig Melchert and read by lin­guist Andrew Byrd. See a trans­la­tion of Schle­icher’s sto­ry, “The Sheep and the Hors­es” below:\nA sheep that had no wool saw hors­es, one of them pulling a heavy wag­on, one car­ry­ing a big load, and one car­ry­ing a man quick­ly. The sheep said to the hors­es: “My heart pains me, see­ing a man dri­ving hors­es.” The hors­es said: “Lis­ten, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the mas­ter, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm gar­ment for him­self. And the sheep has no wool.” Hav­ing heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.\nByrd also reads anoth­er sto­ry in hypo­thet­i­cal Pro­to-Indo-Euro­pean, “The King and the God,” using “pro­nun­ci­a­tion informed by the lat­est insights into PIE.”\nSee Powell’s arti­cle at Archae­ol­o­gy for the writ­ten tran­scrip­tions of both Schleicher’s and Melchert/Byrd’s ver­sions of PIE, and see his arti­cle here to learn about the arche­o­log­i­cal evi­dence for the Bronze Age speak­ers of this the­o­ret­i­cal lin­guis­tic com­mon ances­tor.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nLis­ten to The Epic of Gil­gamesh Being Read in its Orig­i­nal Ancient Lan­guage, Akka­di­an\nHear Homer’s Ili­ad Read in the Orig­i­nal Ancient Greek\nHear What Homer’s Odyssey Sound­ed Like When Sung in the Orig­i­nal Ancient Greek\nWas There a First Human Lan­guage?: The­o­ries from the Enlight­en­ment Through Noam Chom­sky\nWhat Ancient Greek Music Sound­ed Like: Lis­ten to a Recon­struc­tion That’s “100% Accu­rate”\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe phrase “when Dylan went elec­tric” once car­ried as much weight in pop cul­ture his­to­ry as “the fall of the Berlin Wall” car­ries in, well, his­to­ry. Both events have reced­ed into what feels like the dis­tant past, but in the ear­ly 1960s, they like­ly seemed equal­ly unlike­ly to many a seri­ous Bob Dylan fan in the folk scene. They also seemed equal­ly con­se­quen­tial. To under­stand the cul­ture of the decade, we must under­stand the import of Dylan’s appear­ance at the New­port Folk Fes­ti­val in 1965, backed by Mike Bloom­field and oth­er mem­bers of the Paul But­ter­field Blues Band.\nThe death of rock and roll in the 50s is often told through the lens of tragedy, but there was also anger, dis­gust, and mass dis­af­fec­tion. The Pay­ola scan­dal had an impact, as did Elvis join­ing the army and Lit­tle Richard’s return to reli­gion. Rock and roll was bro­ken, tamed, and turned into com­mer­cial fod­der. Sim­ply put, it wasn’t cool at all, man, and even the Bea­t­les couldn’t save it sin­gle­hand­ed­ly. Their arrival on U.S. shores is mythol­o­gized as music his­to­ry Normandy—and has been cred­it­ed with inspir­ing count­less num­bers of musicians—but with­out Dylan and the blues artists he imi­tat­ed, things would very much have gone oth­er­wise.\nIn the ear­ly 60s, Dylan and the Bea­t­les’ “respec­tive musi­cal con­stituen­cies were indeed per­ceived as inhab­it­ing two sep­a­rate sub­cul­tur­al worlds,” writes Jonathan Gould in Can’t Buy Me Love: The Bea­t­les, Britain, and Amer­i­ca. “Dylan’s core audi­ence was com­prised of young peo­ple emerg­ing from adolescence—college kids with artis­tic or intel­lec­tu­al lean­ings, a dawn­ing polit­i­cal and social ide­al­ism, and a mild­ly bohemi­an style…. The Bea­t­les’ core audi­ence, by con­trast, was com­prised of ver­i­ta­ble ‘teenyboppers’—kids in high school or grade school whose lives were total­ly wrapped up in the com­mer­cial­ized pop­u­lar cul­ture of tele­vi­sion, radio, pop records, fan mag­a­zines, and teen fash­ion. They were seen as idol­aters, not ide­al­ists.”\nTo evoke any­thing resem­bling the com­mer­cial pablum of Beat­le­ma­nia, and at New­port, no less, spoke of trea­son to folk authen­tic­i­ty. Some called out “Where’s Ringo?” Oth­ers called him “Judas.” Dylan’s set “would go down as one of the most divi­sive con­certs ever”—(and that’s say­ing a lot)—“putting the worlds of both folk and rock in tem­po­rary iden­ti­ty cri­sis,” Michael Mad­den writes at Con­se­quence of Sound. The for­mer folk hero accom­plished this in all of three songs, “Maggie’s Farm,” “Like a Rolling Stone,” and “Phan­tom Engi­neer,” an ear­ly take on “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry.” Pete Seeger famous­ly “threw a furi­ous tantrum” upon hear­ing the first few bars of “Maggie’s Farm,” above, though he’s since said he was upset at the sound qual­i­ty.\nThe moment was defining—and Dylan appar­ent­ly decid­ed to do it on a whim after hear­ing Alan Lomax insult the Paul But­ter­field Band, who were giv­ing a work­shop at the fes­ti­val. He came back onstage after­ward to play two acoustic songs for the appre­cia­tive audi­ence who remained, unfazed by the vehe­mence of half the crowd’s reac­tion to his ear­li­er set. Yet the rev­o­lu­tion to return rock to its folk and blues roots was already under­way. With­in six months of meet­ing Dylan in 1964, Gould writes, “John Lennon would be mak­ing records on which he open­ly imi­tat­ed Dylan’s nasal drone, brit­tle strum, and intro­spec­tive vocal per­sona.” (Dylan also intro­duced him to cannabis.)\nIn 1965, “the dis­tinc­tions between the folk and rock audi­ences would have near­ly evap­o­rat­ed.” The two met in the mid­dle. “The Bea­t­les’ audi­ence, in keep­ing with the way of the world, would be show­ing signs of grow­ing up,” while Dylan’s fans showed signs of “grow­ing down, as hun­dreds of thou­sands of folkies in their late teens and ear­ly twen­ties” redis­cov­ered “the ethos of their ado­les­cent years.” They also dis­cov­ered elec­tric blues. New­port shows Dylan accel­er­at­ing the tran­si­tion, and also sig­ni­fied the arrival of the great elec­tric blues-rock gui­tarists, in the form of the inim­itable Mike Bloom­field, an invad­ing force all his own, who inspired a gen­er­a­tion with his licks on “Like a Rolling Stone” and on the absolute clas­sic Paul But­ter­field Blues Band debut album, released in The Year Dylan Went Elec­tric.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch Bob Dylan Play “Mr. Tam­bourine Man” in Col­or at the 1964 New­port Folk Fes­ti­val\nBob Dylan Explains Why Music Has Been Get­ting Worse\nTan­gled Up in Blue: Deci­pher­ing a Bob Dylan Mas­ter­piece\nHow Bob Dylan Kept Rein­vent­ing His Song­writ­ing Process, Breath­ing New Life Into His Music\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tOctober 15th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nNear­ly 70 per­cent of Amer­i­cans believe in angels, at least accord­ing to a sta­tis­tic often cit­ed in recent years. But what, exact­ly, comes to their minds — or those of any oth­er believ­ers around the world — when they imag­ine one? Per­son­al con­cep­tions may vary, of course, but we can be fair­ly cer­tain of one thing: most of them will bear no resem­blance to the angels actu­al­ly described in the Bible. Here to give us a sense of their appear­ance is Tom­mie Trelawny, cre­ator of the YouTube chan­nel Hochela­ga, whose video above explains “Why Bible Accu­rate Angels Are So Creepy.”\nFar from the winged, white-robed embod­i­ments of gen­tle­ness we might know from greet­ing cards, says Trelawny, the angels of the Bible, and specif­i­cal­ly the Old Tes­ta­ment, are “hor­ri­fy­ing abom­i­na­tions” who would be more at home in an H. P. Love­craft nov­el. Angel, from the Greek ange­los, which itself comes from the Hebrew mal’akh, means “mes­sen­ger.” That implies an innocu­ous-enough set of duties, but then, you may recall the sto­ry of Passover, with its angel who slaugh­tered the Egyp­tians’ first-born sons; or the angel who “struck 70,000 Israelites to death”; or the angel who “sin­gle­hand­ed­ly killed 185,000 Assyr­i­an sol­diers in one night.”\nThe Bible does­n’t say any­thing about those angels hav­ing wings. “In fact, they look like any ordi­nary per­son,” as do even the most famous exam­ples like Gabriel, Raphael, and Michael. In the grand heav­en­ly scheme of things, such humanoid angels, or Malakh, don’t rank par­tic­u­lar­ly high. Still, they’re one rung above the Cheru­bim, who turn out to be less like Cupid and more like “the myth­i­cal beasts of ancient Mesopotamia, espe­cial­ly the Baby­lon­ian Lamas­su, which has the wings of an eagle, the body of a lion, and the head of a king” — with a more-than-pass­ing resem­blance to the Egypt­ian sphinx or the Hit­tite grif­fin. Even the pop­u­lar image of the pudgy, fly­ing cherub, which emerged much lat­er, seems to have been import­ed from Greek and Roman myths.\nRanked above the Malakh are the six-winged Seraphim, or “burn­ing ones.” The ori­gins of these “care­tak­ers of God’s throne” are sug­gest­ed by the Hebrew word Saraph, mean­ing “a ven­omous ser­pent in the desert,” much like the cobra whose image adorned the head of the Egypt­ian pharaoh. As for the Ophan­im, it’s any­one’s guess where they come from. Tak­ing the form of a wheel with­in a wheel float­ing in the sky, its rims lined with eyes, an Ophan would make for an intim­i­dat­ing sight indeed: per­haps a rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the wheels of God’s char­i­ot, per­haps the result of “the prophet ingest­ing a psy­che­del­ic plant,” and per­haps — accord­ing to a fringe the­o­ry — vis­i­ta­tion by a space­craft. What­ev­er the evi­dence for those expla­na­tions, it’s safe to say they’re not quite as com­fort­ing as all those placid celes­tial harpists.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow Our Depic­tion of Jesus Changed Over 2,000 Years and What He May Have Actu­al­ly Looked Like\nThe Ori­gins of Satan: The Evo­lu­tion of the Dev­il in Reli­gion\nBehold the Codex Gigas (aka “Devil’s Bible”), the Largest Medieval Man­u­script in the World\nChris­tian­i­ty Through Its Scrip­tures: A Free Course from Har­vard Uni­ver­si­ty\nAngels & Demons: The Sci­ence Revealed\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tOctober 15th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen first we take an inter­est in movies, we must fig­ure out our own method of decid­ing what to watch next. The cen­tral fac­tor may be box office per­for­mance, the pres­ence of a favorite per­former, adher­ence to a favorite genre, or the use of a famil­iar sto­ry from oth­er media. Such paths through cin­e­ma can lead to enter­tain­ing view­ing expe­ri­ences, no doubt, but it’s safe to say that very few movie-lovers become bona fide cinephiles with­out even­tu­al­ly switch­ing their alle­giance to direc­tors. In eras past, a prop­er­ly orga­nized video store — that is, one whose tapes, Laserdiscs, or DVDs were ordered alpha­bet­i­cal­ly, by the direc­tor’s name — could pro­vide a gate­way. (Mine was Scare­crow Video.) Today’s bud­ding cinephiles have YouTube chan­nels like The House of Tab­u­la.\nFor­mer­ly known as The Cin­e­ma Car­tog­ra­phy (and before that as Chan­nel Criswell), The House of Tab­u­la has pro­duced many video essays on film pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured on Open Cul­ture. More than a few close­ly exam­ine par­tic­u­lar direc­tors: Andrei Tarkovsky, Stan­ley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Quentin Taran­ti­no, to name just four that appear in The House of Tab­u­la’s new three-and-a-half-hour video “The Mas­ters of Cin­e­ma.”\nA jour­ney through the evo­lu­tion of film as reflect­ed in the work of 78 dif­fer­ent direc­tors, it cov­ers Tarkovsky, Kubrick, Lynch, and Taran­ti­no in its lat­er chap­ters on “the Mod­ern Mas­ters” and “the New School.” The ear­li­er chap­ters exam­ine pic­tures by every­one from Georges Méliès, Sergei Eisen­stein, D.W. Grif­fith, and Char­lie Chap­lin to Alfred Hitch­cock, Aki­ra Kuro­sawa, Fed­eri­co Felli­ni, and Orson Welles.\nThis view of cin­e­ma sub­scribes to “auteur the­o­ry,” which holds the direc­tor to be the guid­ing artis­tic intel­li­gence, or “author,” of a film. Most of us accept at least a ver­sion of this idea rel­a­tive­ly ear­ly in our jour­ney into cinephil­ia, and soon there­after encounter the vari­eties of objec­tion to it that have been lodged for decades and decades. Some direc­tors may oper­ate their own cam­eras, but most don’t; a few direc­tors act in their own movies, but the vast major­i­ty would­n’t even con­sid­er it (which is prob­a­bly all to the good). With some notable excep­tions, cin­e­ma is an intense­ly col­lab­o­ra­tive art, but as House of Tab­u­la co-cre­ator Lewis Bond puts it, the direc­tor is still the “voice” of a film. Togeth­er, the voic­es of the auteur film­mak­ers like the ones fea­tured in this video define the lan­guage of cin­e­ma, or per­haps the lan­guage that is cin­e­ma — one that every cinephile spends a life­time learn­ing to under­stand.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe 30 Great­est Films Ever Made: A Video Essay\n480 Film­mak­ers Reveal the 100 Great­est Movies in the World\nHow Film­mak­ers Tell Their Sto­ries: Three Insight­ful Video Essays Demys­ti­fy the Craft of Edit­ing, Com­po­si­tion & Col­or\nPaul Schrad­er Cre­ates a Dia­gram Map­ping the Pro­gres­sion of Art­house Cin­e­ma: Ozu, Bres­son, Tarkovsky & Oth­er Auteurs\nMar­tin Scors­ese Makes a List of 85 Films Every Aspir­ing Film­mak­er Needs to See\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“New York is humanity itself. Every type of person is here—every ethnicity, every culture, every religion, every viewpoint. And somehow, despite the honking, the yelling, the shoving, we find a way to make it work,” says Brandon Stanton.\nCreating one of the most well-known archives of city life, Stanton is the photographer behind Humans of New York, the ongoing portrait project that shares the stories of everyday people. Since launching the series in 2010, Stanton has amassed 10,000 images that offer a wide-reaching narrative that spans all five boroughs. Humans of New York has long been accessible via wildly popular social media accounts and published in a few books, but now, it’s also sprawled across Grand Central Terminal.\n\nDear New York debuted earlier this month at the iconic station. Fifty-foot portraits projected in the Main Concourse, along with smaller photographs and quotes lining the underground passageway fill every spot typically reserved for advertising and transit information. This marks the first time Grand Central is completely without ads (at least in recent memory), and Stanton funded the takeover entirely on his own—a decision that cost all the money he earned from the project during the last 15 years, he said in an interview.\n“Dear New York is a living, breathing immersive art installation staged in the one place where the entire city comes together—Grand Central. It is a love letter to the people of this city, and about the people of this city,” Stanton added.\nLike Humans of New York, this installation intends to transform public space into a site for finding commonalities and recognizing our shared humanity. To emphasize its focus on community, the project also includes a display of works by 600 New York City Public School students in Vanderbilt Hall.\nDear New York is also the title of Stanton’s newest book, available from Bookshop. And if you’re in the city, stop by Grand Central to see the installation through October 19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nMost of us can imagine a time when we felt tethered to something or someone we knew wasn’t right for us. Perhaps a job takes too much energy, a loved one needs care that’s physically and emotionally demanding, or we find ourselves in a situation where we feel stuck and don’t know how to let go. That’s the universally relatable premise of the enigmatic short film “Sisters.”\nThe short animated film is directed by Andrea Szelesová and produced by Pure Shore Films. It follows the mysterious routine of a young woman. We observe a daily trip to feed and water an unusually large figure that seems to grow bigger every day, half-wedged into the earth amid an expansive meadow.\n\nAs time passes, the interaction becomes more exhausting, and it appears the monumental figure’s health is slowly fading. But what emerges in her place is just as beautiful as the tender care that the protagonist provided all along, granted she can appreciate the situation for what it has become.\n“What we love about ‘Sisters’ is that everyone can find their own meaning in it,” Pure Shore says in a comment. “Indeed, it is about ‘letting go,’ freeing ourselves from what holds us back, whatever that may be.”\nSee the full film on Vimeo.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 2016, while artist McKay Lenker Bayer was still an undergraduate, her professor assigned the class the task of exhibiting their work. Unsure about presenting her work to the public, she downsized, quite literally, showing miniature paintings with teensy-tiny labels. And the idea for a minuscule exhibition space was born.\nIn 2018, Lenker Bayer established Tiny Art Show, a community art project that utilizes unique and unexpected spaces around Provo, Utah, to show original work by numerous artists. Until this year, the project was largely nomadic, but Tiny Art Show now has its own dedicated space.\n\nInstalled at 1:6 scale, the storefront-style gallery sits inside what was originally a stairwell, accessible from street level. Its blue facade is reminiscent of retail spaces in New York City or London, and inside, it’s what Lenker Bayer describes as “a fully functional, commercial art gallery… that just happens to be tiny.” Original work is for sale, opening events draw gatherings of people who enjoy tiny snacks, and you can even grab a tiny newspaper from the vending machine near the door.\nIn addition to its miniature brick-and-mortar presentations, Tiny Art Show also facilitates a series of art projects like the Monthly Mini Mail Club, a subscription that dispatches an itty-bitty periodical called The Tiny Times, plus a booklet from that month’s gallery show. You can also purchase tiny art kits in the shop, along with prints and merchandise.\nExplore more on the project’s website, and keep an eye on Instagram for updates about forthcoming shows.\nWork by Brian Kershisnik\n\nWork by Merrilee Liddiard\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

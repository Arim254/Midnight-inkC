    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History, Politics |   \tDecember 17th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen the Nazis came to pow­er in 1933, they declared the begin­ning of a “Thou­sand-Year Reich” that ulti­mate­ly came up about 988 years short. Fas­cism in Italy man­aged to hold on to pow­er for a cou­ple of decades, which was pre­sum­ably still much less time than Ben­i­to Mus­soli­ni imag­ined he’d get on the throne. His­to­ry shows us that regimes of this kind suf­fered a fair­ly severe sta­bil­i­ty prob­lem, which is per­haps why they need­ed to put forth such a sol­id, for­mi­da­ble image. The IMPERIAL video above explores “the evil genius of fas­cist design,” focus­ing on how Hitler and Mus­soli­ni ren­dered their ide­olo­gies in art and the built envi­ron­ment, but many of its obser­va­tions can be gen­er­al­ized to any polit­i­cal move­ment that seeks total con­trol of a soci­ety, espe­cial­ly if that soci­ety has a suf­fi­cient­ly glo­ri­ous-seem­ing past.\nFas­cis­m’s visu­al lan­guage has many inspi­ra­tions, two of the most impor­tant cit­ed in the video being  Roman­ti­cism and Futur­ism. The for­mer offered “a long­ing for the past, an obses­sion with nature, and a focus on the sub­lime”; the lat­ter “wor­shiped speed, machines, and vio­lence.” Despite their appar­ent con­tra­dic­tion, these dual cur­rents allowed fas­cism “a pecu­liar abil­i­ty to look both back­ward and for­ward, to sum­mon the glo­ry of past empires while promis­ing a rad­i­cal new future.”\nIn Italy, such an empire may have been dis­tant in time, but it was nev­er­the­less close at hand. “We dream of a Roman Italy that is wise and strong, dis­ci­plined and Impe­r­i­al.” Even Hitler drew from the glo­ries of ancient Rome and Greece to shape his own aspi­ra­tional vision of an all-pow­er­ful Ger­man civ­i­liza­tion.\nHence both of those dic­ta­tors under­tak­ing large-scale Neo­clas­si­cal-style archi­tec­tur­al projects “to bring the aes­thet­ics of ancient Rome to their city streets,” includ­ing even mus­cu­lar stat­ues meant to embody the offi­cial­ly sanc­tioned human ide­al. Of course, the builders of the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca had also looked to Roman forms, but they did so at a small­er, more humane scale. Fas­cist struc­tures were designed not just to be eter­nal sym­bols but over­whelm­ing pres­ences, intend­ed “not to ele­vate the soul, but to crush the indi­vid­ual into the crowd and pro­mote con­for­mi­ty.” This, in the­o­ry, would make the cit­i­zen feel small and pow­er­less, but with an accom­pa­ny­ing qua­si-reli­gious long­ing to be part of a larg­er project: that of fas­cism, which sub­or­di­nates every­thing to the state. For the likes of Mus­soli­ni and Hitler (an artist-turned-politi­cian, as one can hard­ly fail to note), aes­thet­ics was pow­er — albeit not quite enough, in the event, to ensure their own sur­vival.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWal­ter Ben­jamin Explains How Fas­cism Uses Mass Media to Turn Pol­i­tics Into Spec­ta­cle (1935)\nYale Pro­fes­sor Jason Stan­ley Iden­ti­fies 10 Tac­tics of Fas­cism: The “Cult of the Leader,” Law & Order, Vic­tim­hood and More\nMus­soli­ni Sends to Amer­i­ca a Hap­py Mes­sage, Full of Friend­ly Feel­ings, in Eng­lish (1927)\nAre You a Fas­cist?: Take Theodor Adorno’s Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Test Cre­at­ed to Com­bat Fas­cism (1947)\nThe Sto­ry of Fas­cism: Rick Steves’ Doc­u­men­tary Helps Us Learn from the Painful Lessons of the 20th Cen­tu­ry\nUmber­to Eco’s List of the 14 Com­mon Fea­tures of Fas­cism\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Design, History |   \tDecember 18th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn the video above, Use­fulCharts cre­ator Matt Bak­er sug­gests that we not refer to the peri­od span­ning the fifth and the late fif­teenth cen­turies as the “dark ages.” In jus­ti­fi­ca­tion, he does­n’t put forth the argu­ment, now fair­ly com­mon, that the time in ques­tion was actu­al­ly full of sub­tle inno­va­tion occlud­ed by mod­ern prej­u­dice. The real prob­lem, as he sees it, is that the slow­ing, if not revers­ing, of the progress of human soci­ety that we’ve tra­di­tion­al­ly regard­ed as occur­ring in what are com­mon­ly known as the Mid­dle Ages only occurred in Europe. What’s more, there have been mul­ti­ple such eras in the world: take the ear­li­er “Greek dark ages” asso­ci­at­ed with the Bronze Age civ­i­liza­tion­al col­lapse of 1177 BC.\nAll this and more comes across at a glance on Bak­er’s Time­line of World His­to­ry, whose design is explained in the video. With char­ac­ter­is­tic Use­fulCharts clar­i­ty (also demon­strat­ed by the World Reli­gions Fam­i­ly Tree and the Evo­lu­tion of the Alpha­bet, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture), it lays out all the peri­ods of his­to­ry we may know bet­ter by their names than by their rela­tion­ship to actu­al events.\nAt the top, it begins with the end of pre­his­to­ry and the start of his­to­ry: that is, when writ­ing devel­oped around 5,300 years ago. At that point, mul­ti­ple civ­i­liza­tions had already begun to estab­lish them­selves around the world, and it is their growth and decline rep­re­sent­ed by the thick­ness of the lines run­ning down the time­line’s reg­u­lar cen­tu­ry-long divi­sions.\nAs the ear­ly Bronze Age gives way to the Bronze Age, the Bronze Age gives way to the Iron Age, and the Iron Age gives way to Clas­si­cal Antiq­ui­ty, these lines of civ­i­liza­tion thick­en into those of empire. None come thick­er than that of ancient Rome, which occu­pies the visu­al cen­ter of the poster (itself, inci­den­tal­ly, avail­able for pur­chase from Use­fulCharts’ site), but the design’s strength lies less in under­scor­ing the impor­tance of any one empire than of reveal­ing how much his­to­ry was going on all over the world at any giv­en time. Using its ver­ti­cal lines to trace the rise and fall of the Olmecs, say, or the Aksum­ite Empire or the Mis­sis­sip­pi­an Cul­ture, one can hard­ly sup­press a feel­ing of Ozy­man­di­an tran­sience. Nor, for that mat­ter, can one ignore that all of us live out our lives with­in the span of two of its hor­i­zon­tal ones.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nAn Inter­ac­tive Time­line Cov­er­ing 14 Bil­lion Years of His­to­ry: From The Big Bang to 2015\nThe His­to­ry of Civ­i­liza­tion Mapped in 13 Min­utes: 5000 BC to 2014 AD\nWorld Reli­gions Explained with Use­ful Charts: Hin­duism, Bud­dhism, Judaism, Islam, Chris­tian­i­ty & More\nThe His­to­ry of the Earth (All 4.5 Bil­lion Years) in 1 Hour: A Mil­lion Years Cov­ered Every Sec­ond\n6,000 Years of His­to­ry Visu­al­ized in a 23-Foot-Long Time­line of World His­to­ry, Cre­at­ed in 1871\nThe Writ­ing Sys­tems of the World Explained, from the Latin Alpha­bet to the Abugi­das of India\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Music, Photography |   \tDecember 18th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nA cen­tu­ry ago, the great French com­pos­er Claude Debussy sat down at a con­trap­tion called a Welte-Mignon repro­duc­ing piano and record­ed a series of per­for­mances for pos­ter­i­ty. The machine was designed to encode the nuances of a pianist’s play­ing, includ­ing ped­al­ing and dynam­ics, onto piano rolls for lat­er repro­duc­tion.\nDebussy record­ed 14 pieces onto six rolls in Paris on or before Novem­ber 1, 1913. Accord­ing to Debussy enthu­si­ast Steve Bryson’s web site, the com­pos­er was delight­ed with the repro­duc­tion qual­i­ty, say­ing in a let­ter to Edwin Welte: “It is impos­si­ble to attain a greater per­fec­tion of repro­duc­tion than that of the Welte appa­ra­tus. I am hap­py to assure you in these lines of my aston­ish­ment and admi­ra­tion of what I heard. I am, Dear Sir, Yours Faith­ful­ly, Claude Debussy.”\nThe selec­tion above is “La soirée dans Grenade” (“Grena­da in the evening”), from Debussy’s 1903 trio of com­po­si­tions titled Estam­pes, or “Prints.” Debussy was inspired by the Sym­bol­ist poets and Impres­sion­ist painters who strove to go beyond the sur­face of a sub­ject to evoke the feel­ing it gave off. “La soirée dans Grenade” is described by Chris­tine Steven­son at Notes From a Pianist as a “sound pic­ture” of Moor­ish Spain:\nDebussy’s first-hand expe­ri­ence of Spain was neg­li­gi­ble at that time, but he imme­di­ate­ly con­jures up the coun­try by using the per­sua­sive Haben­era dance rhythm to open the piece–softly and sub­tly. It insin­u­ates itself into our con­scious­ness with its qui­et insis­tence on a repeat­ed C sharp in dif­fer­ent reg­is­ters; around it cir­cles a lan­guid, Moor­ish arabesque, with nasal aug­ment­ed 2nds, and a nag­ging semi­tone pulling against the tonal cen­tre, occa­sion­al­ly inter­rupt­ed by mut­ter­ing semi­qua­vers [16th notes] and a whole-tone based pas­sage. Debussy writes Com­mencer lente­ment dans un rythme non­cha­la­m­ment gra­cieux [Begin slow­ly in a casu­al­ly grace­ful rhythm] at the begin­ning, but lat­er Tres ryth­mé [Very rhyth­mic] in a bright­ly lit A major as the dance comes out of the shad­ows, ff [Fortissimo–loudly], with the click of cas­tanets and the stamp­ing of feet.\nDebussy was 52 years old and suf­fer­ing from can­cer when he made his piano roll record­ings. He died less than five years lat­er, on March 25, 1918. Since then, his beau­ti­ful and evoca­tive music has secured a place for him as one of the most influ­en­tial and pop­u­lar com­posers of the 20th cen­tu­ry. As Roger Hecht writes at Clas­si­cal Net, “Debussy was a dream­er whose music dreamed with him.”\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn “Rio Tigre,” thick globs of fire consume a shoreline forest, while smoke clouds the skies and melts the landscape from top to bottom. Despite this catastrophic setting, there’s also a tiny man standing in a canoe, seemingly unaware or unable to grasp the destruction. \nThe unsettling scene is part of Alexis Rockman’s Conflagration series, which translates a distinctly contemporary sense of climate anxiety into eerie paintings. Made from oil paint and cold wax on wood, these pieces are chunky and gestural, placing human touch and material excess in direct proximity.\n“Karaikal Beach”\nFor nearly five decades, Rockman has rooted his practice in environmental concerns. Today, his body of work is a sort of archive of a changing climate, one in which dire warnings about a warming planet have not inspired robust action but rather entrenched us further in a cycle of denial and fatalism.\nFeedback Loop, then, is an apt title for the artist’s upcoming debut at Jack Shainman Gallery. Featuring many forest fire paintings, the exhibition will span watercolors and cinematic panoramas Rockman has made throughout his career, along with works containing soil and organic matter gathered near the Great Lakes. This presents a visual timeline of the artist’s thinking on the changing climate, and of course, the newer works feel more urgent. As the years pass, the scale of devastation grows, and the diminutive animals and figures are no match for raging fires that threaten everything in their paths.\nIn biology, feedback loops are often categorized as either positive or negative, and Rockman suggests that we’ve entrenched ourselves in an inescapable downward spiral. Given the tiny, lone figures that occupy just a few paintings—others simply feature empty boats—he presents a world in which immense damage is done and the chance of rescue is near impossible.\nBut where Rockman taps into a universal imbalance through recurring motifs of fire and smoke, he’s also interested in the particular. His works are often based on specific locations like South America’s Rio Pastaza or Lake Athabasca, which borders Saskatchewan and Alberta. In this way, he homes in on the hyperlocal, drawing our attention to real places and urgently addressing what we’re already witnessing.\nFeedback Loop runs from January 15 to February 28 in New York. Explore more of the artist’s work on his website.\n“Lake Athabasca”\n“Forest Floor”\n“Padma River”\n“Rio Pastaza”\n“Long Lake”\n“Pioneers”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nA little more than ten years ago, a particularly—shall we say—interesting painting restoration went viral, spawning memes and earning the piece the cringeworthy nickname “Monkey Christ.” The work, known as “Ecce Homo,” is a century-old portrayal of Jesus in a church in Borja, Spain, that a local octogenarian attempted to restore.\nThe attention “Ecco Homo” brought, which could be viewed as positive or not depending on your perspective, actually bolstered the town’s struggling economy and raised tens of thousands of euros for charity as people pilgrimaged to see the infamously bungled attempt. But it’s far from the only aging artwork to meet disastrous results when someone tried their hand at an update.\n\n\n\nFor Julian Baumgartner, a second-generation art restorer and owner of Baumgartner Fine Art Restoration, there’s little he hasn’t seen. Crackling varnish? Check. Deteriorating stretcher bars? Check. Stapled edges? Say no more.\nWhen an oval-shaped portrait fell into his hands, with its structural framework crumbling and its canvas stained, that wasn’t even the worst of it. This particular painting had also been unskillfully painted over to freshen it up, despite—as Baumgartner discovers—the fact that the “fix” actually completely changed the entire feel of the work. As he works, he illuminates how the amateur attempt to restore the work actually eliminated the subtle nuances of the artist’s original intention, and by extension, the sitter’s personality.\nBaumgartner is based in Chicago and runs what is now the oldest restoration studio in the city. Using archival and reversible materials, he conserves and restores artworks by removing discoloration, camouflaging cracks, repairing holes, and much more.\nVia his popular YouTube channel, Baumgartner chronicles the satisfyingly meticulous, step-by-step process he employs to breathe new life into paintings, whether made by anonymous artists or titans of art history.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe Tunicate salp, commonly referred to as a salp, looks a bit like an elongated jellyfish—minus the tentacles. These barrel-shaped creatures fall into a category of marine animals called sea squirts, which are, believe it or not, actually taxonomically closer to humans than they are to jellyfish. That’s because, despite their gelatinous-looking forms, they’re actually invertebrates with a kind of spine, known as a notochord, that runs down their back and anchors muscles.\nSalps can range from a fraction of an inch in length to more than a foot. On a dive off the coast of Indonesia, photographer Massimo Giorgetta encountered one about two inches long that had recently enjoyed a bit of a buffet. The image recently took the bronze award in the Nature/Underwater category of the Tokyo Foto Awards.\n\nIt’s a puzzle trying to understand what parts of the salp are its body and which are its prey, as its remarkably transparent flesh allows us to see everything at once. But upon closer inspection, a yellow blob looks suspiciously like a small fish, and it appears that a few larval crabs and shrimps are along for the ride.\nSalps typically eat phytoplankton, but they’ll essentially ingest anything that gets trapped in a meshy feeding net. “Inside the Tunicate salp is a box fish in juvenile form, some very small flatworms in juvenile form, then some larval Squilla mantis, some heteropods, and several animals that I cannot determine,” Giorgetta says. \nYou might also enjoy winning entries for Close-Up Photographer of the Year or Steven Kovacs’ ethereal photographs of larval fish.\n\t\n\t\n\t",

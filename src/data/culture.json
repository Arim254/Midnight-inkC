    "body": "\n\tin Business, Design |   \tNovember 21st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe humorist San­dra Tsing Loh once described her gen­er­a­tional cohort as “today’s young, high­ly trained, down­ward­ly mobile pro­fes­sion­als: ‘dump­ies.’ We’re just emerg­ing from years of col­lege only to learn that there are no jobs avail­able for peo­ple with our advanced qual­i­fi­ca­tions,” and thus no route to own­er­ship of all their hoped-for lifestyle accou­trements. No, she’s not a mil­len­ni­al, but rather what she calls a “late boomer” in an essay that dates from the mid-nineties — a few years after IKEA founder Ing­var Kam­prad “came into South­ern Cal­i­for­nia, utter­ing those five immor­tal words: ‘Halo­gen! Impos­si­ble Price: $29!’ The rest was his­to­ry. In that instant, we dump­ies found our niche. We rose up and became the IKEA Gen­er­a­tion!”\nIKEA could expand so far out of its native Swe­den thanks to the suc­cess of prod­ucts like the LACK cof­fee table, the sub­ject of the new Pri­mal Space video above. Though small in scale and high­ly unpre­pos­sess­ing in appear­ance (and, let’s face it, a visu­al byword for cheap fur­nish­ings sec­ond only to the num­ber-one-sell­ing BILLY book­shelf) it’s long been a steady sell­er the world over, not least because its price, just under the equiv­a­lent of ten euros when intro­duced in 1981, has nev­er been raised. To man­age that, IKEA has had to use every trick in its book: not just the do-it-your­self “flat-packed” design it pio­neered, but also non-warp­ing par­ti­cle board, hon­ey­comb paper struc­tures for max­i­mum strength using a min­i­mum of mate­r­i­al, and even new­ly engi­neered leg-fold­ing machines.\nHow­ev­er briskly it sells, this par­tic­u­lar prod­uct may be unfor­tu­nate­ly named in an Eng­lish-speak­ing mar­ket; “What they ‘lack’ is sta­bil­i­ty,” one inter­vie­wee says to Loh. Still, it remains emblem­at­ic enough of the cor­po­rate mis­sion once artic­u­lat­ed by Kam­prad him­self: “To cre­ate a bet­ter every­day life for the major­i­ty of peo­ple.” (“How many Repub­li­can politi­cians can say they’ve done that?” Loh adds. “How many Democ­rats?”) That extends to the design of IKEA’s stores, which offer only one path to fol­low all the way through, like an extra-large fun­house. As not­ed in the video, while this forces cus­tomers to pass every prod­uct — and thus every temp­ta­tion to impulse buy — it also turns a vis­it into an expe­ri­ence unto itself, before the cus­tomer even reach­es the cafe­te­ria. Fun­ny; I could go for a plate of meat­balls right about now.\nIf you want to take a deep dive into the ori­gin and growth of IKEA, lis­ten to this three hour episode from the Acquired pod­cast.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nIKEA Dig­i­tizes & Puts Online 70 Years of Its Cat­a­logs: Explore the Designs of the Swedish Fur­ni­ture Giant\nHans Rosling Uses Ikea Props to Explain World of 7 Bil­lion Peo­ple\nWhat Hap­pens When a Cheap Ikea Print Gets Pre­sent­ed as Fine Art in a Muse­um\nMeet the Mem­phis Group, the Bob Dylan-Inspired Design­ers of David Bowie’s Favorite Fur­ni­ture\nSpike Jonze’s Imag­i­na­tive TV Ads\nCharles & Ray Eames’ Icon­ic Lounge Chair Debuts on Amer­i­can TV (1956)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nEstablished in 2019, Tbilisi Mural Fest has a deceptively simple goal: to turn Georgia’s capital city into one huge public gallery. For the artist-organizers, who also create works under the moniker TMF Studio, contemporary murals have the ability to transform unsightly, blocky developments into giant works of art. The paintings are not only a pleasure to look at but also create a more inviting urban environment.\nWith a few exceptions, much of the recent work created for the festival is representational, showing people engaged in activities like harvesting grapes or dancing. International artists bring a variety of styles to often narrow, vertical compositions, adorning the sides of multilevel buildings. \nAfzan Pirzade and TMF Studio, part of the “Dance” series\nThrough a wide range of figurative, geometric, or abstract styles, Tbilisi’s mural program is expanded each year, engaging viewers in both commercial and residential areas.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 2019, Cornwall-based artists William Arnold and James Fergusson began paying a lot of attention to wild apple trees growing in unique and sometimes unlikely locations around the Cornish countryside. Remarkably, every apple seed is capable of producing an entirely different variety. And it’s this immense genome that inspired the pair to begin their ongoing project called Some Interesting Apples.\nApple cultivars that we often see in supermarkets, like Gala or Honeycrisp, need to be carefully produced in a process called clonal propagation, in which a cutting from a desirable tree is grafted onto a new one, creating, essentially, a copy. Because even if a Honeycrisp seed sprouted and produced a tree, it wouldn’t be another Honeycrisp!\n\n\n\nArnold and Fergusson have discovered more than 600 wild apple varieties throughout Cornwall over the past seven years. Arnold is a photographer and visually documents new types, while the duo revels in finding and sampling the wide array of “feral” varieties that grow along roadsides and in parks across the county. A new short film, produced by Ffern, rounds up some of the duo’s tasting notes.\nRather than giving individual names to hundreds of different apples, some of which are sweet and dessert-like and some of which are almost too tart to bear, Arnold and Fergusson assign them a what3words designation, using the wayfinding app popular in the U.K. that denotes specific places using three random words rather than GPS coordinates or traditional street addresses.\nThe what3words location for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, is cage.rocks.gladiators. For Some Interesting Apples, the unique codes provide a useful, sometimes absurd, and occasionally poetic way to label different varieties based on where the trees were found, like a “horse wish gossip” apple, or a “bats prefer flame” variety.\nIn 2023, in collaboration with the University of Exeter and the National Trust, Arnold and Fergusson spearheaded a unique project called The Wilding Mother Orchard, situated near Helford, which has been established with dozens of wild root stocks. The orchard is not only a celebration of the fruit’s natural diversity but also a way of broaching how the effects of the climate crisis may alter our access to varieties we take for granted in the future.\n\n“People get alarmed when they realise that the heritage apple varieties they love might not survive in a climate-changed world,” Arnold told the BBC. “They don’t appreciate that we are surrounded by unique wild apple volunteers that may be better adapted to future conditions.”\nSee the short film on Vimeo, and check out Arnold’s photographs on his website.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has come through yet again with an unprecedented image from our Solar System, this time of a unique pair of Wolf-Rayet stars known as Apep. A Wolf-Rayet is a massive, very hot star that’s in the later stages of its life, quickly losing mass with the help of strong stellar winds. Thanks to Webb, researchers were able to observe coiled shells of dust around the pair for the first time. Previous documentation collected by other telescopes had only ever shown one dust shell.\nWhat makes this observation especially interesting is that there’s actually a third fiery orb at play here, which Webb’s new data confirms is gravitationally bound to the other two in this system. A massive supergiant, this third player “slices” holes into the dust shells—which have been emitted over the last 700 years—creating a unique effect. “To find the holes the third star has cut like a knife through the dust, look for the central point of light and trace a V shape from about 10 o’clock to 2 o’clock,” NASA says.\n\n\n\nThe celestial phenomena’s name, Apep, references the Egyptian god of chaos. Because while it may appear to be moving slowly, these swirling clouds race at a remarkable speed. “The dust-producing Wolf-Rayet stars in Apep aren’t exactly on a tranquil cruise,” NASA says. “They are whipping through space and sending out dust at 1,200 to 2,000 miles per second.” Because the dust is so dense, it shows up clearly in the image.\n“Webb’s data, combined with observations from the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, confirmed that the two Wolf-Rayet stars sail past one another approximately every 190 years,” says a statement. “Over each orbit, they make a close pass for 25 years, producing and spewing amorphous carbon dust.” \nFind more on NASA’s website.\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the Karakoram Range on the northeastern border of Pakistan, a group of Indigenous women and girls is defying conventions with a seemingly simple pastime: soccer.\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan Girls Football League is a bastion of independence and autonomy amid a traditionally conservative environment. “In our culture, girls were brought up to be brides,” says Karishma, the co-founder of the league, in a short documentary about the movement. “Everybody doesn’t want to be a princess.”\n\n\n\nTitled “Girls Move Mountains,” the striking film is by Anna Huix, who visits this remote region and tags along with members of the Wakhi people as they practice and compete. As Huix shows, soccer is much more than a game for participants, who put themselves at risk in order to play. “As a child, Karishma faced harassment for wearing soccer attire, and as a woman, she battles online bullying from aggressive crowds challenging the rights of girls in the mountains,” the Barcelona-based filmmaker writes.\nWhile news clips highlight the backlash against the league, we also see Karishma’s grandmother, who supports the women and shares that she would have played the game had it been available to her.\nIf you’re in New York, you can see “Girls Move Mountains” at a screening for Dumbo Film Festival. Find more of Huix’s work on her website and Instagram. You also might enjoy Celia D. Luna’s portraits of these skateboarders.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel H. Weiss (image courtesy the Philadelphia Art Museum museum)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nChanges have been coming to the Philadelphia Art Museum (PhAM) as quickly as the leaves have fallen this month, most recently with the appointment of Daniel H. Weiss as new director and CEO today, November 21. Weiss, who served as president and CEO of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan until 2023, will start his three-year contract at PhAM on December 1, less than a month after the museum board’s highly publicized ouster of former PhAM Director and CEO Alexandra “Sasha” Suda.\nWeiss’s appointment concludes PhAM’s search for a new museum leader, following its dismissal of Suda for “cause” in an emailed notice on November 4. Suda, who was three years into a five-year contract, has since filed a lawsuit against the museum alleging multiple violations of her employment agreement after it was revealed that PhAM trustees commissioned an external investigation that recommended her resignation. In the suit, Suda also accused multiple museum officers of disparaging her to the press.\nAt the time, a PhAM representative declined to provide information about the reason for Suda’s dismissal and said its board was “focused on fulfilling the museum’s mission as we enter our 150th year.”\nWeiss also joins the institution on the heels of its controversial rebrand, steered by Suda, from the Philadelphia Museum of Art to the Philadelphia Art Museum. He noted in a press statement that he “look[s] forward to working with the Board, staff, and stakeholders to ensure the art museum continues its vital mission and advances its strategic priorities.”\nWeiss was appointed as The Met’s president in 2015, and became the museum’s interim and then tenured CEO in 2017 upon the sudden resignation of predecessor Thomas P. Campbell amid a multimillion-dollar deficit and staff cuts.\nSoon into his leadership, Weiss was credited with reducing the operating budget deficit and, in 2018, implemented a controversial change to the museum’s admission policies that obligated out-of-towners to pay $25. The Met announced record attendance numbers for that year.\nHe also steered the museum through the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and during New York City’s stringent quarantine restrictions in 2020. The Met credited him with “reengineering its budget … to retain staff” during the museum’s five-month closure to the public, though 81 employees were laid off one month into the quarantine shutdown while Weiss and Hollein took 20% salary cuts, and then another 79 were laid off, 181 were furloughed, and 93 accepted voluntary retirement three weeks before the museum reopened in late August 2o2o. \nWeiss also coordinated the end of unpaid internships at the museum through a $5 million gift in 2020, and reportedly pulled in $1.5 billion in private donations over his tenure. However, the city-based labor union Local 2110 UAW said in a press release this week that “initial conversations about unionizing started in 2020, with staff sharing concerns generated by the pandemic,” and that staff at The Met contacted the union in 2022. Museum workers cited “long-term pay inequities” and “lack of job protection” in an announcement about petitioning the National Labor Relations Board for a union election on Monday, November 17.  \nPrior to helming The Met, Weiss served as the president and a professor of art history at Haverford College from 2013 to 2015, and at Lafayette College from 2005 to 2013. Since stepping down, Weiss returned to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, as a professor of humanities for the past two years.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

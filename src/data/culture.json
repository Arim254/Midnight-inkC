    "body": "\n\tin English Language, History, Language |   \tDecember 29th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt’s easy to imag­ine the myr­i­ad dif­fi­cul­ties with which you’d be faced if you were sud­den­ly trans­port­ed a mil­len­ni­um back in time. But if you’re a native (or even pro­fi­cient) Eng­lish speak­er in an Eng­lish-speak­ing part of the world, the lan­guage, at least, sure­ly would­n’t be a prob­lem. Or so you’d think, until your first encounter with utter­ances like “þat troe is daed on gaerde” or “þa rokes for­leten urne tun.” Both of those sen­tences appear in the new video above from Simon Rop­er, in which he deliv­ers a mono­logue begin­ning in the Eng­lish of the fifth cen­tu­ry and end­ing in the Eng­lish of the end of the last mil­len­ni­um.\nAn Eng­lish­man spe­cial­iz­ing in videos about lin­guis­tics and anthro­pol­o­gy, Rop­er has pulled off this sort of feat before: we pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured him here on Open Cul­ture for his per­for­mance of a Lon­don accent as it evolved through 660 years.\nBut writ­ing and deliv­er­ing a mono­logue that works its way through a mil­len­ni­um and a half of change in the Eng­lish lan­guage is obvi­ous­ly a thornier endeav­or, not least because it involves lit­er­al thorns — the þ char­ac­ters, that is, used in the Old Eng­lish Latin alpha­bet. They’re pro­nounced like th, which you can hear when Rop­er speaks the sen­tences quot­ed ear­li­er, which trans­late to “The tree is dead in the yard” and “The rooks aban­doned our town.”\nThe word trans­late should give us pause, since we’re only talk­ing about Eng­lish. But then, Eng­lish has under­gone such a dra­mat­ic evo­lu­tion that, at far enough of a remove, we might as well be talk­ing about dif­fer­ent lan­guages. What Rop­er empha­sizes is that the changes did­n’t hap­pen sud­den­ly. Non-Scan­di­na­vian lis­ten­ers may lack even an inkling that his farmer of the year 450 is talk­ing about sheep and pigs with the words skēpu and swīnu, but his final lines, in which he speaks of pos­sess­ing “all the hot cof­fee I need” and “friends I did­n’t have in New York” in the year 2000, will pose no dif­fi­cul­ty to Anglo­phones any­where in the world. Even his list of agri­cul­tur­al wealth around the ear­ly thir­teenth cen­tu­ry — “We habben an god hus, we habben mani felds” — could make you believe that a trip 600 years in the past would be, as they said in Mid­dle Eng­lish, no trou­ble.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nTrac­ing Eng­lish Back to Its Old­est Known Ances­tor: An Intro­duc­tion to Pro­to-Indo-Euro­pean\nHear the Evo­lu­tion of the Lon­don Accent Over 660 Years: From 1346 to 2006\nWhat Shakespeare’s Eng­lish Sound­ed Like, and How We Know It\nWhere Did the Eng­lish Lan­guage Come From?: An Ani­mat­ed Intro­duc­tion\nA Brief Tour of British & Irish Accents: 14 Ways to Speak Eng­lish in 84 Sec­onds\nThe Entire His­to­ry of Eng­lish in 22 Min­utes\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe inner crit­ic cre­ates writer’s block and sti­fles adven­tur­ous writ­ing, hems it in with safe clichés and over­think­ing. Every writer has to find his or her own way to get free of that sour­puss ratio­nal­ist who insists on stran­gling each thought with log­i­cal analy­sis and fit­ting each idea into an oppres­sive pre­de­ter­mined scheme or ide­ol­o­gy. William S. Bur­roughs, one of the most adven­tur­ous writ­ers to emerge from the mid-20th cen­tu­ry, famous­ly employed what he called the cut-up method.\nDevel­oped by Bur­roughs and painter Brion Gysin, this lit­er­ary take on the col­lage tech­nique used by avant-garde artists like Georges Braque orig­i­nat­ed with Sur­re­al­ist Tris­tan Tzara, who “pro­posed to cre­ate a poem on the spot by pulling words out of a hat.” The sug­ges­tion was so provoca­tive, Bur­roughs claims in his essay “The Cut-Up Method,” that cut-ups were there­after “ground­ed… on the Freudi­an couch.”\nSince Bur­roughs and Gysin’s lit­er­ary rede­ploy­ment of the method in 1959, it has proved use­ful not only for poets and nov­el­ists, but for song­writ­ers like David Bowie and Kurt Cobain. And any frus­trat­ed nov­el­ist, poet, or song­writer may use it to shake off the habit­u­al thought pat­terns that cage cre­ativ­i­ty or choke it off entire­ly. How so?\nWell, it’s best at this point to defer to the author­i­ty, Bur­roughs him­self, who explains the cut-up tech­nique thus:\nThe method is sim­ple. Here is one way to do it. Take a page. Like this page. Now cut down the mid­dle and cross the mid­dle. You have four sec­tions: 1 2 3 4 … one two three four. Now rearrange the sec­tions plac­ing sec­tion four with sec­tion one and sec­tion two with sec­tion three. And you have a new page. Some­times it says much the same thing. Some­times some­thing quite different–(cutting up polit­i­cal speech­es is an inter­est­ing exercise)–in any case you will find that it says some­thing and some­thing quite def­i­nite. Take any poet or writer you fan­cy. Here­say, or poems you have read over many times. The words have lost mean­ing and life through years of rep­e­ti­tion. Now take the poem and type out select­ed pas­sages. Fill a page with excerpts. Now cut the page. You have a new poem. As many poems as you like.\nBur­roughs gives us “one way” to do it. There may be infi­nite oth­ers, and it’s up to you to find what works. I myself have pushed through a cre­ative funk by mak­ing mon­tages from scraps of ancient poet­ry and phras­es of mod­ern pop, clichés ripped from the head­lines and eso­teric quotes from obscure reli­gious texts—pieced togeth­er more or less at ran­dom, then edit­ed to fit the form of a song, poem, or what­ev­er. Vir­tu­al cut-and-paste makes scis­sors unnec­es­sary, but the phys­i­cal act may pre­cip­i­tate epipha­nies. “Images shift sense under the scis­sors,” Bur­roughs writes; then he hints at a synes­the­sia expe­ri­ence: “smell images to sound sight to sound sound to kines­thet­ic.”\nWho is this method for? Every­one, Bur­roughs asserts. “Cuts ups are for every­one,” just as Tzara remarked that “poet­ry is for every­one.” No need to have estab­lished some exper­i­men­tal art world bona fides, or even call one­self an artist at all; the method is “exper­i­men­tal in the sense of being some­thing to do.” In the short video at the top, you can hear Bur­roughs explain the tech­nique fur­ther, adding his occult spin on things by not­ing that many cut-ups “seem to refer to future events.” On that account, we may sus­pend belief.\nAs Jen­nie Skerl notes in her essay on Bur­roughs, cut-up the­o­ry “par­al­lels avant-garde lit­er­ary the­o­ry” like Jacques Derrida’s Decon­struc­tion. “All writ­ing is in fact cut ups,” writes Bur­roughs, mean­ing not that all writ­ing is pieced togeth­er with scis­sors and glue, but that it’s all “a col­lage of words read heard over­heard.” This the­o­ry should lib­er­ate us from oner­ous notions of orig­i­nal­i­ty and authen­tic­i­ty, tied to ideas of the author as a sui gener­is, all-know­ing god and the text as an expres­sion of cos­mi­cal­ly ordered mean­ing. (Anoth­er sur­re­al­ist writ­ing method, the game of Exquis­ite Corpse, makes the point lit­er­al.) All that meta­phys­i­cal bag­gage weighs us down. Every­thing’s been done—both well and badly—before, Bur­roughs writes. Fol­low his meth­ods and his insis­tent cre­ative max­im and you can­not make a mistake—“Assume that the worst has hap­pened,” he writes, “and act accord­ing­ly.”\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow David Bowie, Kurt Cobain & Thom Yorke Write Songs With William Bur­roughs’ Cut-Up Tech­nique\nThe “Priest” They Called Him: A Dark Col­lab­o­ra­tion Between Kurt Cobain & William S.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis past summer, Participant Inc., a Lower East Side art nonprofit, hosted an exhibition on Chloe Dzubilo, a trans woman who became an AIDS activist after contracting the disease. The show, curated by Alex Fleming and Nia Nottage, was immensely rich and important for both its historical and personal insights into the artist’s life. Through text-based works and drawings, the artist painted an intimate and sometimes painful picture of her experience living in subsidized housing for people with AIDS and discrimination at the hands of medical professionals. I reviewed the show with the hope that it would strike a nerve with readers from all walks of life who have experienced subpar healthcare, housing instability, and personal strife.It was one of a handful of New York shows this year that centered art by or about trans and gender-nonconforming people. At a moment when basic freedoms and legal protections for people who fall under the trans umbrella — even the right to be recognized — are being stripped away by the Trump administration, it’s encouraging to see some art institutions platforming artists such as Dzubilo. The art world’s support of work by or about trans and gender-nonconforming people seems to fly under the radar more than its support of many other marginalized groups. Last fall, I was able to sit in on a private conversation between two prominent artists I admire. Both identify as nonbinary and they discussed how, even in liberal circles, gender identity is often dismissed as a non-issue. Listening to them, I realized how true this often is in art and culture more broadly. I’m privileged to be in a position to help change this. This year I was grateful to raise the profile of some trans and nonbinary artists in my role as an editor and writer, and maybe to prompt some of the myriad conversations that can come out of their art.  The experiences that most stood out to me as an art critic and editor this year were those that brought attention to some of these exhibitions. In addition to my review of Dzubilo’s show, I was able to cover another historically significant show, Dueñas de la Noche: Trans Lives and Dreams in 1980s Caracas at the Institute for Studies on Latin American Art. Alexis Clements wrote about The Met’s Casa Susanna, while Emma Cieslik covered Spectrum of Desire: Love, Sex, and Gender in the Middle Ages at The Met Cloisters. Another great read is my colleague Lisa Yin Zhang’s review of Nayland Blake’s work at Matthew Marks Gallery. Through their writings, visual art, and performance, Blake has been a guiding light to LGBTQ+ artists (and others) for decades. Vaginal Davis, a pioneering LGBTQ+ artist whose work ranging from sculpture to punk music was the subject of a major survey at MoMA PS1, was covered here by Daniel Larkin.John Yau’s review of nonbinary artist Xingzi Gu’s paintings of androgynous figures illuminated the process and concepts behind the ethereal artworks. More pointed in their statements about identity but just as dreamlike was Hortensia Mi Kafchin’s recent show at PPOW Gallery, reviewed here by Cat Dawson, and Young Joon Kwak’s sparkling sculptures at the Leslie-Lohman Museum, reviewed by AX Mina.One of the year’s highlights was Tate Modern’s thorough and thoroughly compelling retrospective of Leigh Bowery, reviewed by Olivia McEwan. Bowery identified as a gay man, but his performances and handmade costumes, created amid 1980s London’s dazzling art underground, push gender-bending to new heights of complexity.Our writers covered plenty of other great shows this year, too: Aruna D’Souza’s incisive assessment of Duane Linklater at Dia Chelsea, Lori Waxman’s empathetic discussion of Chicago’s Red Line Service, a nonprofit that assists unhoused people, Carolina A. Miranda’s report on Chile’s 1980s punk underground, and Claudia Ross’s review of Burn Me at The Box in Los Angeles, which featured art and artists impacted by LA’s January fires. And I can’t sign off for the year without mentioning an exhibition that blew me away: Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg’s Only for the Wicked at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery was gorgeous and devastating.On a different note, make sure to read Senior Editor Valentina Di Liscia’s list of artworks that spoke truth to power in 2025.

    "body": "\n\tIn its 2024 Year-in-Review, ARTnews noted a widening schism in the art world, defined by a moral fault: the continued support of Israel amid the destruction of Gaza. A year later—and more than three years into what a UN commission of inquiry determined this fall to be a genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip—artists, critics, museums, gallerists, and audiences remain divided over what has become the ethical litmus test of our lifetimes. This year, that divide has shaped not just discourse but practice, determining exhibits, funding, and, in turn, what stories cultural institutions choose to tell. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThis rolling censorship crisis was further amplified in 2025 by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. His tenure so far appears like a successful second act of the marquee mission of his first presidency: The ideological overhaul of the United States’ arts and cultural landscape. Leveraging a brazen expansion of presidential power, Trump and his team have targeted museum leaders and aesthetic movements while undermining the federal government’s grant-making capabilities—leaving the local organizations that form the bedrocks of American arts floundering for funds or permanently shuttered. \n\n\tAs the year progressed, the civil struggle for America’s ideals reverberated abroad: art workers versus authoritarian intervention; institutions enforcing a controversial definition of dissidence; and an unusually politicized selection process for the forthcoming Venice Biennale. This year may go down as the dawn of a dark age for artistic expression—though artists, as ever, will insist on the light. \n\n\tBelow are several episodes of censorship and defiance that made headlines in the art world this year. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Smithsonian Institution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTrump Versus the Smithsonian\t\n\n\tIn 2025, Trump opened war on the Smithsonian Institution, the consortium of Washington, D.C. museums and archives that includes the National Museum of American History, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Museum of the American Indian, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. After retaking office in January, Trump issued an executive order intended to combat what an accompanying fact sheet called “anti-American ideology” at the Smithsonian, whose network was already in the process of disbanding its diversity offices when the order was signed. \n\t\n\n\tThe Smithsonian is not a federal agency, and as such is not under direct White House purview, however federal funding comprises nearly two-thirds of its $1 billion annual budget. Additionally, its Board of Regents includes the Chief Justice of the United States, the Vice President, three Senators, three US Representatives, and nine citizens, making it vulnerable to government overreach. \n\n\tAnd indeed, it became obvious just how vulnerable the Smithsonian really was. In May, Trump said he fired Kim Sajet, director of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, moving legal experts to question whether he had the power to make that call. Sajet then clarified in a public statement that she would depart the post she had held since 2013, closing the confusing and concerning chapter.\n\n\tJD Vance, the Vice President, had by this point already been deputized by Trump to ensure that “future appropriations” continue to flow from Congress to the Smithsonian, and by the summer, an internal review of the Smithsonian was opened. Under this directive, every aspect of the Smithsonian’s programming—including its didactics, the art itself, and grants awarded to artists—were judged to see if they aligned with the new values outlined by the executive order, which spoke of a “divisive, race-centered ideology” at the Smithsonian. \n\t\n\n\tIn response, Smithsonian leadership publicly reiterated the network’s nonpartisanship and independence, however critics alleged that the overhaul was already underway. The National Museum of American History, for example, was scrutinized for editing Trump’s two impeachments out of its related display. That institution subsequently put that display back on view—with altered text, echoing an earlier incident in which content on African American history was temporarily removed from government websites. \n\n\tDoubling down on its directive, the White House website published a list of artworks and shows that did not match the administration’s values, such as one exploring sculpture as a signifier of power at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The National Museum of African American History and Culture language regarding “white dominant culture,” already denounced in the executive order, was again blasted. \n\t\n\t\tArtists Take a Stand Against Federal Overreach at the Smithsonian\t\n\n\tMounting concerns of government overreach at the Smithsonian erupted in July when Amy Sherald, the painter who skyrocketed to fame with her 2018 portrait of Michelle Obama, canceled her exhibition set to open this fall at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, where it would’ve been the first solo presentation by a Black contemporary artist at the institution. Sherald said she made her decision after she learned that her painting of a Black transgender Statue of Liberty might be removed from the show in a bid by Smithsonian leadership to avoid President Trump’s ire. (The painting had appeared in previous versions of the show at other museums, and went on to feature on the cover of the New Yorker.)\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmy Sherald, Trans Forming Liberty, 2024.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKevin Bulluck/©Amy Sherald/Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“When governments police museums, they are not simply policing exhibitions,” Sherald wrote in a MSNBC op-ed. “They are policing imagination itself.” Her protest appears to have moved other artists to act similarly.\n\n\tIn September, another controversy hit the Smithsonian when artist Nicholas Galanin withdrew from a symposium related to “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum that Trump denounced for promoting “the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct,” a view confirmed by modern science. Galanin was to speak at the Smithsonian American Art Museum on Saturday as part of a two-day symposium, an event not publicly listed on the Smithsonian’s website at the time of its occurrence. \n\n\t“The decision to make the symposium a private event with a curated guest list and request that we not record or share it on social media effectively censors those of us who would be participating,” Galanin wrote at the time. A Smithsonian American Art Museum spokesperson denied any censorship.\n\t\n\t\tThe Whitney’s Storied ISP Program Shutters Over Pro-Palestine Performance\t\n\n\tNext to the Smithsonian, no American museum weathered a greater political storm in 2025 than the Whitney Museum in New York, which canceled a pro-Palestine performance planned as part of the Whitney’s 2025 Independent Study Program in May, then went on in June to dismiss Sara Nadal-Melsió, the program’s associate director since 2024. (Artist and writer Gregg Bordowitz had already been demoted to the status of director-at-large at the ISP, though the circumstances of that shift remain unclear.) \n\t\n\n\tAccording to a statement posted to Instagram from Nadal-Melsió, the performance, titled No Aesthetic Outside My Freedom: Mourning, Militancy, and Performance and conceived by  Fadl Fakhouri, Noel Maghathe, and Fargo Tbakhi, was canceled by the Whitney Museum after its leadership viewed a recording of its initial presentation at the Poetry Project. Originally commissioned by the leftist Jewish magazine Jewish Currents, the performance was preceded by a request that attendees only remain in the audience if they “love Palestinians wholly and completely.” Viewers should leave if they “believe in Israel in any incarnation,” they were told. According to the artists, the Whitney version did not include this call to action.\n\n\tThe Whitney said in May that its decision to cancel the performance was “clear and necessary.” Many disagreed. ISP curators and artists publicly protested the cancelation, and in July, more than 100 artists and scholars, including Emily Jacir, Hans Haacke, and Michael Rakowitz, signed an open letter in support of Nadal-Melsió, whose position was eliminated. “Her dismissal is one act of patriarchal institutional violence among many, yet another symptom of the entangled violences that suffuses the present climate of suppression in the United States,” the letter reads. Its signatories also reiterated a request from the Artists at Risk Connection (ARC) for the museum to “convene an independent investigation into the termination of the ISP’s Associate Director and its implications for academic and artistic freedoms at the museum.”\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPro-Palestine demonstrators occupying the Whitney Museum lobby on May 23. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTessa Solomon/ARTnews\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNadal-Melsió also spoke openly on the matter, publishing her own letter in which she said that the ISP “has always been unapologetically engaged with the politics of its times,” noting that participants were currently addressing “fascism at home and the relentless genocide being carried out in Gaza.” Now, she wrote, “we also face unprecedented censorship and a threat to our foundational independence because of our pursuit of the very dialogue that makes the ISP what it is.”\n\t\n\t\tSally Mann Warns of Censorship After Police Raid in Texas \t\n\n\tThe conservative campaign against the arts reached Texas at the start of 2025, when a selection of photographs by Sally Mann in a group exhibition at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth was seized by police on suspicion of child pornography. The controversy surrounded images of her rural Lexington, Virginia, home taken in the 1990s that featured her nude, underage children. The images are not sexual, however they have been characterized by conservative critics over the years as “child porn.” \n\n\tScrutiny escalated into action later in January, when Fort Worth police raided the exhibition on the basis of an investigation into the images, exacerbating tensions around freedom of artistic expression in Texas. The incident was explicitly referenced in relation to a bill proposed that April that would introduce civil penalties up to $500,000 against any museum showing “certain obscene or harmful material.” (The Texas Penal Code defines “obscene” as any kind of performance or material that depicts sexual acts without literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.)\n\t\n\n\tThe Fort Worth Police Department ultimately returned the contested photographs to Sally Mann’s gallery, Gagosian, following an investigation that cost the state nearly $7,000. Speaking later to NPR, Mann said: “We’re entering a new era of culture wars, I’m quite sure. And I think the people who are pursuing this are much more sophisticated and have many more tools at hand.” She suggested social media as one such tool.\n\t\n\t\tAustralia’s Venice Biennale Pick Is Dropped, Then Reinstated\t\n\n\tAt the world’s premier international art event, when scores of curators, collectors, and journalists descend on the lagoon city, every aspect of the artist chosen to represent a national pavilion—their identity, past accolades, and practice—becomes a proxy for the aesthetics and ideals a nation values at that moment in its history. This dynamic was illustrated with damning clarity in the case of Lebanese-born artist Khaled Sabsabi and curator Michael Dagostino, who were selected to helm Australia’s 2026 Venice Biennale pavilion, only to have the appointment abruptly rescinded by Creative Australia, the organization that makes the Australian Pavilion in Venice possible. Although the pair was ultimately reinstated, the episode spurred multiple resignations at Creative Australia, one of the largest funding bodies in the art world, and deepened fears that artists perceived as critical of Israel are subject to censorship.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCurator Michael Dagostino and artist Khaled Sabsabi.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnna Kucera\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe controversy began in February, just days after Creative Australia announced Sabsabi’s selection. A column in the Australian labeled the pavilion a “creative approach to racism,” singling out You, Sabsabi’s 2007 video installation that includes manipulated footage of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah addressing a crowd after the 2006 Lebanon-Israel war. The article also accused Sabsabi and Dagostino of having “favored boycotts of Israel,” a reference to Sabsabi’s 2022 Sydney Festival withdrawal over its Israeli government sponsorship. Days later, the board of Creative Australia unanimously reversed their selection, citing the risk of a “prolonged and divisive debate.”\n\n\tThe fallout was swift, with senior Creative Australia staffers Mikala Tai and Tahmina Maskinyar resigning in protest. Simon Mordant, formerly the international ambassador for the Australian Pavilion and a major cultural philanthropist, later tendered his own resignation, describing the situation as “a very dark day for Australia and the arts.” Artists and institutions also rallied behind Sabsabi, including Palestinian artist Emily Jacir, a former Golden Lion winner at the Biennale. “Shame on Creative Australia,” Jacir wrote on Instagram. The five shortlisted candidates for the pavilion issued an open letter demanding Sabsabi’s reinstatement. \n\t\n\n\tAmid this outpouring of support, Sabsabi told the Guardian that Creative Australia’s sudden reversal was “dismantling” his career. “Nobody should have to go through this torture,” he added. Then, on July 2, following an independent review and months of backlash, Creative Australia reinstated Sabsabi and Dagostino to Australia’s 2026 Venice Biennale pavilion. In a joint statement, the pair called the reversal “a sense of resolution” after “significant personal and collective hardship,” and thanked the creative community whose “unwavering support” made it possible.\n\t\n\t\tDocumenta Adopts a Controversial Definition of Antisemitism, Spurring Backlash\t\n\n\tIsrael’s war in Gaza has generated some of the most pressing political debates waged in Germany in recent history, pulling its cultural sector into a long-simmering existential crisis over antisemitism, racism, xenophobia, and the legacy of the Holocaust. Thus far, German cultural institutions have landed on what might generously be described as the side of caution—often opting out of the forum by canceling the condition for it all together. Throughout 2024 a wave of cancelations, defundings, and resignations rippled through the sector, including the departure of the entire Documenta 16 finding committee, following a scandal at the quinquennial’s 2022 iteration over an antisemitic artwork.\n\t\n\n\tDocumenta 15, the 2022 edition, has come to define this ongoing cultural reckoning, as underscored by a high-profile incident this December: the cancellation of an exhibition of work by Arte Povera artist Marisa Merz, which has been scheduled to open at the Fridericianum, Documenta’s historic anchor. (The institution mounts major surveys during the periods between editions.) Beatrice Merz, the artist’s daughter and the president of the Fondazione Merz in Turin, told Monopol magazine that she withdrew the exhibition in protest of Documenta’s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, a framework that artists and academics in Germany have argued is politically divisive as under its guidelines, which state that criticism of Israel or Zionism may be construed as antisemitic.  The German Bundestag formally adopted the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism in 2024, despite opposition.\n\n\t“A collaboration with the Museum Fridericianum would have meant accepting the museum’s code of conduct, which uses the IHRA definition of antisemitism—a definition with which I don’t agree in every respect,” Merz said. “In my view, it would have been more appropriate to use the JDA, the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. For this reason, as president of the Fondazione Merz, I felt it was right to cancel the exhibition project. I am convinced that art should not be restricted by borders and, above all, must be free of prejudice.” \n\t\n\n\tIn response, Andreas Hoffmann, managing director of Documenta and the Fridericianum, said in a statement that the Documenta Code of Conduct is binding for the institution’s employees, not for exhibition artists or associates: “Insofar as Documenta deems artistic expressions incompatible with the principles set out in this Code of Conduct, it reserves the right to comment on its resulting position and, if necessary, to explain it in the immediate visual context of the exhibited artworks.”\n\t\n\t\tA Curator Flees Bangkok After China Censors His Art Exhibition\t\n\n\tBeijing flexed its influence over dissident artists beyond its borders. In September, the curator of a show critiquing authoritarianism in China at the Bangkok Art and Culture Center departed for London amid fears of arrest and deportation. \n\n\tThree days after “Constellation of Complicity: Visualising the Global Machine of Authoritarian Solidarity” opened in July, Chinese embassy staff, accompanied by Bangkok city authorities, “entered the exhibition and demanded its shutdown,” the show’s curator—an artist from Myanmar who goes by the name Sai—told Reuters. The exhibition featured work by exiled artists from countries including China, Russia, Iran, and Burma, and set out to illustrate how authoritarian regimes “collaborate, affirm one another, and reproduce forms of violence under the guise of sovereignty and order,” according to the museum’s website—a goal it ultimately fulfilled, though not by the intended means. \n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe entrance to the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto by: Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe New York Times reported that the directors of the BACC told Sai in an email that the museum had received warnings from the Chinese embassy, the Thai Foreign Ministry, and Bangkok city officials that the exhibition could cause “diplomatic tensions” for Thailand with China. The show remained on view, though multiple edits were made to the display, including the redaction of names of Hong Kong, Tibetan and Uyghur artists, as well as portions of the description of their homelands. Also removed at Beijing’s behest were Tibetan and Uyghur flags, postcards featuring Chinese President Xi Jinping, and a postcard examining links between China and Israel.\n\n\tThe BACC’s directors described the locations targeted for removal as “politically sensitive places where the Chinese government has been tightening its control,” according to the Times. The museum also reportedly removed materials addressing Beijing’s treatment of ethnic minorities and Hong Kong from the show.\n\n\t“It is tragically ironic that an exhibition on authoritarian cooperation has been censored under authoritarian pressure,” said Sai, cofounder of Myanmar Peace Museum, in a statement. “Thailand has long been a refuge for dissidents. This is a chilling signal to all exiled artists and activists in the region.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tCare: It is priceless, often uncompensated, and more necessary to the continuation of human civilization as we know it than fossil fuels. It is the thing that gets us out of infancy when we cannot lift our own heads and the thing that helps us through the agonizing transition of death. In between, it preserves us, heals us, educates us, clears away our refuse, laughs at our jokes, and permits us to have options and make change. If you think you don’t need care, think again. Chances are, someone is working to care for you right now, at this very moment. It’s worth asking yourself if you deign to pay that person or even say thank you.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tWho is the preeminent figure of care? If we are speaking in secular terms (I don’t have much room to consider alternatives), the answer is mothers. Mothers care and keep us alive. It’s who they apparently are. But the mother is a tricky figure because she always seems to fail to meet our expectations or maintain the identity that society has chosen for her. The art world has recently taken “her” up as a preeminent figure of our times, dedicating numerous surveys to motherhood and emphasizing the creative-procreative roles of artists like Käthe Kollwitz and Alice Neel. The trend seems to reflect a collective anxiety not just about care and where to find it, but about vulnerability more broadly. For mothers seem at once preeminently strong and preeminently exploitable; we don’t compensate mothers, and we often criticize them irrationally and without mercy. Just consider Jung-a Kim, who had to hire private security after she failed to keep her children out of the shot during her political analyst and BBC newscaster-partner’s from-home report on the situation in North Korea in 2017. If we look to mothers now in our museums and galleries, it may be because their ambiguous and often imperiled situation mirrors that of the democratic citizen more broadly.\n\n\tSince the 2010s, there have been a growing number of exhibitions related to mothering and birth. In October 2011, performance artist Marni Kotak, having designed her ideal birthing space at Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, gave birth to her son Ajax in a public event. Two years later, artist Natalie Loveless initiated a series of events under the umbrella of what she terms “new maternalisms,” conceiving of the work of creating and caring for children as a site from which serious art can—seamlessly and unpretentiously—emerge. The art and artists Loveless brought together involved neither mere depictions of motherhood nor exemplary mothers. Rather, they and the “New Maternalisms” project understood caring (not necessarily or exclusively by women or mothers) as a profoundly generative and significant activity that is itself a form of art. As Kotak and Loveless demonstrated, perhaps taking influence from such feminist artists of the 1970s as Mierle Laderman Ukeles and Mary Kelly, it is not necessary to “do more.” Mothering is already creative.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tView of Marni Kotak’s installation “The Birth of Baby X,” 2011, at Microscope Gallery, New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Microscope Gallery, New York\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Fondazione Nicola Trussardi’s 2015 survey, “The Great Mother,” was, as its name suggests, more concerned with the objective or objectified figure of mother. Its curator, Massimiliano Gioni, may have derived some inspiration from Simone de Beauvoir’s assertion that “it was as Mother that woman was fearsome; it is in maternity that she must be transfigured and enslaved” in designing this ambivalent look at the power of maternity. Notably inflected by the work of Surrealist artists who sometimes swore off pregnancy altogether (Meret Oppenheim) or saw it as a form of machinelike productivity (almost all male Surrealists), the show was designed to compare images of motherhood across time and varying social conditions. As Gioni wrote in a catalog essay, “Analyzing the representation of motherhood therefore means asking first and foremost who has the right to make decisions regarding bodies and desires, and who has the right to represent them.” While this invocation of questions related to reproductive justice might on the surface seem like a promising starting point, it tended to turn the focus of the exhibition toward the exigencies and restrictions of fathers and governments, rather than permitting the art to speak for itself, as in Kotak and Loveless’s explorations.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tView of the exhibition “Designing Motherhood: Things That Make and Break Our Births‚” 2025–26, at the Museum of Arts and Design, New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Jenna Bascom/Courtesy Museum of Arts and Design, New York\n\t\n\n\n\n\tTHE 2020s HAVE SEEN  a new focus on the artist as a mother whose practice is apparently enriched by her experience of being a parent. This may have something to do with the way in which the Covid pandemic laid bare the West’s deprioritization of care. After all, emotional abandonment was among the pandemic’s many widespread negative effects. Each pod, or maybe each person, was on their own, an island, with the exception of the protests in the summer of 2020, when masses gathered in the streets for Black Lives Matter. Take care were the watchwords on everyone’s pixelated lips, broadcast with varying degrees of clarity via Zoom. Take care of yourself—if you can.\n\n\tIn 2021 a wildly successful Alice Neel retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art—including portraits of pregnant people, families, and children—placed mothering and care at the center of this artist’s story.Neel was the mother of four and deeply concerned with how everyday life was created and sustained by the people around her. Her thick-lined portraits reflect a form of concern that might be maternal in nature and that tends to revise our concept of artistic mastery, rendering it warmer, more casual and personal. It is likely no accident that the show was popular, coming as it did on the heels of the social deprivation of lockdown. Its humor and general air of kindness and inclusivity suggested that the domestic sphere, which had been a confining space for many people at this time, could paradoxically contain multitudes and be expansive even in its familiarity.\n\t\n\n\tSubsequent retrospectives with related goals include the Neue Galerie’s 2024 Paula Modersohn-Becker survey, the Museum of Modern Art’s 2024 Käthe Kollwitz exhibition, and the same institution’s forthcoming Ruth Asawa and Helen Frankenthaler shows (worth noting that Frankenthaler was the stepmother of two), as well as the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s recent “Mary Cassatt: At Work.” These initiatives suggest that institutions are becoming more conscious of the broad interest inherent to the practices of artists who found ways to incorporate domestic labor into their artmaking and vice versa. A traveling exhibition organized by the Hayward Gallery, “Acts of Creation: On Art and Motherhood,” on view until 2026 at the Southbank Centre, London, updates this focus by surveying more contemporary work, including that by painter Tala Madani, whose “Shit Moms” (2019–) series is a brilliant send-up of the ongoing misogynist denigration of care work.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tView of the exhibition “Good Mom/Bad Mom: Unraveling the Mother Myth,” 2025, at Centraal Museum, Utrecht.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Gert Jan van Rooij/Courtesy Centraal Museum, Utrecht\n\t\n\n\n\n\tA separate series of more critical exhibitions also center themes of pregnancy and motherhood, but attempt to use these themes to raise broader social and political questions. These include “Portraying Pregnancy: From Holbein to Social Media” (2020) at the Foundling Museum in London, “Labor: Motherhood & Art”(2020) at the New Mexico State University Art Museum, “A Perfect Power: Motherhood and African Art” (2020) at the Baltimore Museum of Art, “Picturing Motherhood Now”(2021) at the Cleveland Museum of Art, “Good Mom/Bad Mom: Unraveling the Mother Myth” (2025) at Centraal Museum in Utrecht, and “Designing Motherhood: A Century of Making (and Unmaking) Babies” (2021) at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia and opening at the Museum of Arts and Design in Manhattan this fall.Each of these forward-thinking presentations of artworks and design objects has urged visitors to consider the agency of birthing and parenting people as models for human society more generally.\n\t\n\n\tThese shows were concerned with grieving the difficulties and losses associated with birth and motherhood, as well as with describing the aspects of care that surpass restrictions of law and convention. They also sought to broaden the concept of mothering, following scholar and critic Hortense Spillers’s thought, to be a practice that all can participate in regardless of gender, sex, or biological relationship. Complex and challenging in the best ways, these exhibitions suggest how museums can support conversations around pressing social issues such as the medicalization of birth, immigration policy and the practice of family separation, and racism and ableism within care systems. “Picturing Motherhood Now” was particularly innovative in this respect, including such current work as Jacolby Satterwhite’s collaborations with his mother in which together they explore her experience of making art about schizophrenia.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTala Madani: Shit Mom (The Streakers), 2019.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom top: Photo Flying Studio/Courtesy David Kordansky Gallery, Los Angeles and New York\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAS INTRIGUING as these exhibitions are, recent publications may even surpass them in interest. MIT Press has recently published an array of books about the politics of mothering, reproductive health, and media and design in relation to parenting. The finest among these is perhaps the catalog for Designing Motherhood, edited by Michelle Millar Fisher and Amber Winick, a beautifully designed book that incorporates astonishing images from the weird and sometimes disturbing history of the engineering of objects, drugs, garments, and material and social structures designed to support and control maternal bodies. These include such dubious products as anti-radiation clothing, postpartum mesh underwear, and Carefree Panty Shields, as well as wonders like birthing furniture and Grace Jones’s 1979 constructivist maternity dress designed by Antonio Lopez. If you read one book about parenting and birth this year, this should be it.\n\t\n\n\tI have additionally been drawn to the innovative publications of Thick Press. This experimental press, founded by a social worker and a graphic designer, has been putting out a cornucopia of pamphlets and anthologies making brilliant use of inexpensive materials and addressing the scarcity of care in the contemporary United States in a head-on fashion. Thick Press’s recent An Encyclopedia of Radical Helping is a masterpiece, with A to Z entries on topics in mental health and community-building, as well as artistic practice: A is for “abundance,” “Afrofuturism,” “aging positivity,” “art therapy,” and more, while B is for “being with,” “bike and car repair collectives,” “boredom,” and “breaking the rules.” Like the critical exhibitions listed above, it points toward new ways of combining aesthetics and practice to shore up our worlds in a time of crisis.\n\n\tAs the US has become the least safe place to give birth in the industrialized world, as Black parents face outsize risks in pregnancy and birth (see LaToya Ruby Frazier’s extraordinary documentary photographs for the 2018 New York Times Magazine feature by Linda Villarosa, “Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis”), as child separation becomes a norm at our borders, some might wish to retreat into private life or minimize these harms by treating them as issues for women or, failing that, “someone else.” It’s easy to want to turn away from these facts and events and continue to think of motherhood as a sort of sacred sphere.\n\t\n\n\tBut if you ask me, a person who has given birth and is raising a child, there’s nothing that special about being a mom. Sorry if this assertion offends you. Alas, I must stand by it. All the things you might expect about motherhood are true for me: I love my child, I’ve sacrificed my body and professional life on behalf of my child, I’d gladly do this all again. Contrary to majority experience, I’m even happier being a parent than I was beforehand. In a very limited sense, I’m a pro-natalist poster child and potential trad wife myself. But I can’t pretend there is anything all that special about this, and the reason I can’t is because I know there is nothing natural about the social and political conditions that elevate my relationship with my child above all other relationships I may have in my life—and that simultaneously hold me responsible for preserving and educating my child in ways that no other person, including my child’s father, is held responsible. I am aware that there is a long-standing American tradition of forcing people to care. This understanding that people can be forced to care is, tragically, a foundational aspect of our country. And it seems we are not planning to revise this original tenet in 2025.\n\n\tSo for me, mothering opens a form of historical understanding which is, to be frank, a form of grief. It also causes me to ask questions about the present. Why is there no place for me to rest when I am carrying a child through an American city? Why is childcare so scarce? Why was I advised (I refused) to give birth on my back? Art about mothers and mothering is at its best when it acknowledges ambiguity and ambivalence. This is no easy feat, for how do you simultaneously represent the joy a person may feel that care can be given freely and the terror a person can feel that care is given freely, the terrifying vulnerability of the need to care? How do you show the alarming, exhausting, and frustrating need to support survival, alongside the joy of seeing a child thrive? The artists Louise Bourgeois and Kara Walker are two of those who best portray the heady combination of ecstasy and horror that can accompany mothering, to give you some sense of what I mean. As the best interdisciplinary work is showing, understanding mothering in our time is key to understanding the vulnerabilities of our freedoms. Mothering is not only “of” its time. It may be always ahead of its time as well.  \n",

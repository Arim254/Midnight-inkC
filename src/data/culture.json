    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tDecember 25th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nIt will no doubt come as a relief to many read­ers that San­ta Claus appears to have been a Union sup­port­er. We know this because he appears dis­trib­ut­ing gifts to sol­diers from that side of the Mason-Dixon in one of his ear­li­est depic­tions. That illus­tra­tion, “San­ta Claus in Camp” (above), first appeared in the Harper’s Week­ly Christ­mas issue of 1862, when the Amer­i­can Civ­il War was still tear­ing its way through the coun­try. Its artist, a Bavar­i­an immi­grant named Thomas Nast, is now remem­bered for hav­ing first drawn the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty as a don­key and the Repub­li­can Par­ty as an ele­phant, but he also did more than any­one else to cre­ate the image of San­ta Claus rec­og­nized around the world today: more than Nor­man Rock­well, and more, even, than the Coca-Cola Com­pa­ny.\n\nSan­ta Claus is an Angli­ciza­tion of Sin­terk­laas, a Dutch name for Saint Nicholas, who lived and died in what’s now Turkey in the third and fourth cen­turies, and who’s been remem­bered since for his kind­ness to chil­dren. Few of us would rec­og­nize him in his por­trait from 1294 that is includ­ed in the Pub­lic Domain Review’s pic­to­r­i­al his­to­ry of San­ta Claus, but with the pass­ing of the cen­turies, his images became mixed with those of oth­er fly­ing, win­ter-asso­ci­at­ed char­ac­ters from Ger­man­ic and Norse myth. In 1822, Clement Moore per­formed a defin­ing act of rhyming syn­the­sis with his poem “A Vis­it from St. Nicholas” (often called “ ‘Twas the Night Before Christ­mas”): in its vers­es we find the bun­dle of toys, the rosy cheeks, the white beard, the bel­ly shak­ing like a bowl full of jel­ly.\n\nNast clear­ly under­stood not just the appeal of Moore’s descrip­tion, but also the char­ac­ter’s pro­pa­gan­da val­ue. His very first ren­di­tions of San­ta Claus appear in the upper cor­ners of an 1862 Harper’s Week­ly illus­tra­tion of a pray­ing wife and her Yan­kee sol­dier hus­band. Near­ly two decades lat­er, Nast drew the car­toon “Mer­ry Old San­ta Claus” (imme­di­ate­ly above), whose cen­tral fig­ure remains imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able to us today, even as its moti­vat­ing polit­i­cal cause of high­er wages for the mil­i­tary has become obscure. In the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, the icon­ic Father Christ­mas would be enlist­ed again to lend pub­lic sup­port to U.S. efforts in World War I and II, in the very decades when Rock­well was fur­ther refin­ing and cement­ing his image in pop­u­lar cul­ture. The once-unlike­ly result was an Amer­i­can San­ta Claus: “the sym­bol of our empire,” in the words of The New York­er’s Adam Gop­nik, “as much as Apol­lo was of the Hel­lenic one.”\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch San­ta Claus, the Ear­li­est Movie About San­ta in Exis­tence (1898)\nDid San­ta Claus & His Rein­deers Begin with a Mush­room Trip?: Dis­cov­er the Psy­che­del­ic, Shaman­is­tic Side of Christ­mas\nHear “Twas The Night Before Christ­mas” Read by Stephen Fry & John Cleese\nJ.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Fashion |   \tDecember 26th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nUpon hear­ing the name of Sal­vador Dalí, even a total lay­man in the art world is bound to get visions of melt­ing clocks. Sur­pris­ing­ly, for an artist who showed so much self-mar­ket­ing savvy, Dalí nev­er brought an actu­al time­piece in that dis­tinc­tive­ly, even canon­i­cal­ly sur­re­al shape to mar­ket. But that hard­ly stopped Carti­er from putting out the Crash, whose dis­tort­ed shape may have always brought The Per­sis­tence of Mem­o­ry to mind, but whose name hints at the inspi­ra­tion of a watch smashed up in a car wreck. The Crash came out in swing­ing-six­ties Lon­don at its very height, by which time Dalí him­self had been design­ing real jew­el­ry for more than a quar­ter cen­tu­ry.\n\n\n\t\n\n?si=v8xd7w6Tr3ZQzIIq\nYou can see a few of Dalí’s jew­els in the 1960 British Pathé clip at the top of the post. Unsur­pris­ing­ly, they occu­py a realm apart from, or at least orthog­o­nal to, that of con­ven­tion­al jew­el­ry. Some of them move: Liv­ing Flower, for instance, which “opens to reveal sta­men and petals paved with dia­monds. The mech­a­nism is embed­ded in mala­chite from the Con­go, which to Dalí rep­re­sents the unknown, latent forces, while the gold and dia­mond flow­ers, known beau­ty and cre­ativ­i­ty.”\nAngel Cross, by con­trast, embod­ies “the hypox­i­o­log­i­cal con­cept of exis­tence — what­ev­er that means.”  Cer­tain­ly, Dalí nev­er claimed to play to the sen­si­bil­i­ty of the British, though some of them might go in for The Roy­al Heart, with its “pul­sat­ing rubies rep­re­sent­ing our queen, heart beat­ing con­stant­ly for her peo­ple, while the nugget gold sym­bol­izes the peo­ple shel­ter­ing and pro­tect­ing their ruler.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe seg­men­t’s out­takes fea­ture more footage of these pieces, giv­ing us a longer look at works like The Eye of Time, embed­ded with a small clock signed by Dalí, and the “leaf-veined hands” he described as “reach­ing out to the future.” Oth­er of his vivid jew­el­ry designs include the Medusa brooch, com­plet­ed with a nest of ruby-eyed gold snakes, and a con­struc­tion that lit­er­al­izes — and, at the same time, sur­re­al­izes — the expres­sion “ruby lips and teeth like pearls.” Real­ized in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the well-regard­ed jew­el­ers Car­los Ale­many, Eric Ert­man, and Hen­ryk Kas­ton, and often inspired by his wife and muse Gala, they may be over­shad­owed by Dalí’s paint­ings and draw­ings, but haute cou­ture does pay them occa­sion­al homage. What else — indeed, who else — could have inspired the throb­bing heart-shaped rhine­stone neck­lace seen on Schi­a­par­el­li’s mod­els last sum­mer at Paris Fash­ion Week?\nvia Messy Nessy\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nSal­vador Dalí’s Sur­re­al Cut­lery Set from 1957\nThe Tarot Card Deck Designed by Sal­vador Dalí\nWhen Sal­vador Dalí Cre­at­ed a Sur­re­al­ist Fun­house at New York World’s Fair (1939)\nWhat Makes Sal­vador Dalí’s Icon­ic Sur­re­al­ist Paint­ing “The Per­sis­tence of Mem­o­ry” a Great Work of Art\nCap­ti­vat­ing Col­lab­o­ra­tion: Artist Hubert Duprat Uses Insects to Cre­ate Gold­en Sculp­tures\nTake a Jour­ney Through 933 Paint­ings by Sal­vador Dalí & Watch His Sig­na­ture Sur­re­al­ism Emerge\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n            I joined Hyperallergic six years ago because I was drawn to its integrity and its commitment to tell stories that no other art publication would. And then I discovered the most rewarding part of working here — the freedom to speak my mind without fear. That’s not something to take for granted in a field plagued by bad-faith journalism and subservient, uncritical thinking. Now, as editor-in-chief of Hyperallergic, these values are my north star. This is my pledge: We will always speak our minds freely to meet the moment. We will stand for truth, justice, and equal rights for all. We will fight against tyranny, racism, misogyny, anti-LGBTQ+ hate, and elitism in the art world and beyond.We will hold art institutions and power players accountable.  We will champion art workers, art teachers and students, labor organizers, community activists, and marginalized groups — and help them be seen and heard. And we will always see art as a basic human right, not an investment asset for the ultra-wealthy. We’ve proven our commitment to these values for 16 years, sometimes at the cost of our bottom line. Help me lead Hyperallergic into this next chapter of its history. There’s still so much more to do and say. So much to fight for and against. I need you by my side.

    "body": "\n            Welcome to the 317th installment of A View From the Easel, a series in which artists reflect on their workspace. This week, artists make work alongside their daughter and draw inspiration from local museums.Want to take part? Check out our submission guidelines and share a bit about your studio with us through this form! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.Daniel McCoy Jr., Española, New MexicoHow long have you been working in this space?Four years.Describe an average day in your studio.I wake around 5:15am. I wake up my family and animals. We leave the house around 7, and I drive 35 miles south up to Santa Fe. I return around 9:15am from dropping my Wife Topaz, who is a teacher, son Levon, and daughter Fia at three separate schools. I begin painting around 10am. Music and coffee play an important role at this time. I work until 2:30pm then repeat the process. We will usually do something for dinner, and then I will work until late into the evening. Especially if there is a time-sensitive project that I am working on.How does the space affect your work?This is a comfortable space connected to my home. The important issue is that there is beautiful scenery outside that allows a connection to nature. Throughout the day, I see the sunrise, sunset, view the mountains, and view the stars. How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?I am near Santa Fe, which has a thriving art scene with many galleries and museums to visit for historic art. I live between the Tewa Pueblos nearby and at times I get to view what my friends are creating. I visit the gallery I am represented by, Hecho a Mano, a few times each month to gather inspiration from the current shows. My wife and I are both involved in education in the arts, so we see the beginnings of artistic growth. Plus, I have the best friends a guy could ever have, and they are all artists.What do you love about your studio?It holds my favorite books, my favorite instruments, and all my ideas. What a fortunate human I am. I am very grateful. What do you wish were different?More space, more machines, and woodworking tools. An outside area for carving. The elevation is pretty high here in the mountains and the summer sun can get pretty hot.What is your favorite local museum?SITE Santa Fe. I have had the opportunity to work with the team on various shows over the years. Very special people to me.What is your favorite art material to work with?Oil-based paints. Particularly One Shot Enamel on large surfaces. Keri Arlotta, Oakwood, OhioHow long have you been working in this space?One year.Describe an average day in your studio.A cozy, creative corner in my house is where I find myself with my easel. If I were to zoom out, you could see my four-year-old's toys surrounding my sacred corner of creativity. Her laughter and music from the bijou television above my fireplace mantle echoes amongst the walls. Beside my studio space is a large grid picture window and beyond the window, large colorful foliage illuminates colors into my zone that are so profound and beautiful. The sounds, the sights, and the peace I find here allow me to open new doors within myself. I stand, rarely sit, as I begin blending colors beside my easel. A fresh canvas awaits me and the tone of my space provides a peace within me that allows me to connect to the depths within myself. How does the space affect your work?My space is full of love and light and when I get to soak into that ambience, I am able to tap into a steady flow of creativity.How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?Oakwood is a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. Within Oakwood, large trees consume the city. It’s easy to get lost in a trail, especially in fall, as the leaves die and the colors of dying leaves captivate us. Just a few minutes down the street I am a member and frequent observer at The Contemporary Dayton. I also enjoy checking out work at The Dayton Art Institute and Rosewood Arts Centre.What do you love about your studio?I love the natural light I’m provided with in my studio. I love that the walls in my space are filled with the trials and errors of my own curiosity. I enjoy that my studio is in the heart of my home, where all the things I love gather. I'm exploring the depths of myself here while I witness my daughter explore depths of her own imagination around me. What do you wish were different?Space. I cannot stress this enough. I have a creative corner, but I often imagine what limitations the size of my studio space provides. If I had more space, maybe I could get my hands on different techniques, textures, etc. Or if I had space for a larger canvas, what could I bring to life there? What is your favorite local museum?Dayton Art Institute.What is your favorite art material to work with?Acrylics on canvas.\n                  \n                      \n                        Community\n                      \n                      \n                        A View From the Easel\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n    \n                Daily Newsletter\n                As writers and artists, we say the quiet part out loud, and we leave a record of our refusals and dreams. \n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Detail of Rose B. Simpson, \"Heights I, AP 2/2\" (2024) on the campus of the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico (photo courtesy Jason Ordaz)\n    \n        \n            Blue became my favorite color as soon as I laid eyes upon that most reproduced of artworks: Hokusai’s “The Great Wave off Kanagawa,” a framed poster of which still hangs in my grandmother’s room. Maybe you grew up with a print of this piece somewhere in your home, too.Over the last 12 months though, as blue as they’ve been, I find myself drawn more and more to the green that hooks my eye: the brushstrokes behind enthralled ballet dancers in British artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye’s “Harp-Strum” (2016), the shifting fabric in Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka’s 1931 “Young Woman in Green” and the candy paint of the Bugatti in her 1929 self-portrait, the phthalo green skin of Byron Kim’s ’90s Belly Painting series.But color is also an entrypoint — a way of changing how I see. Working with the many critics, artists, authors, and poets who have contributed to Hyperallergic this year, particularly our Opinion and Books sections, has required me to wipe my lens clean and reframe my thinking. That’s one of the gifts of editing; I love to learn and unlearn as I go along. And this year, I got to work on pieces that did what we in the arts are called to do — to respond and speak out. In New York City, artist Caitlin MacBride eulogized Kremer’s, a beloved and vital pigment shop that closed its physical storefront after three decades due, in part, to the Trump administration’s tariff policies. She describes how perusing its shelves became a meditative part of making art, grounding the process in tactility and sensation from the beginning.Among the excerpts we published, I was particularly proud to share essays drawn from Black in Blues by Imani Perry and Speculative Relations: Indigenous Worlding and Repair by Joseph M. Pierce (Cherokee). Perry writes unforgettably: “The same color could be a slur and a praise. Brown could be both luxurious and grotesque, and blue adornment could be garish or gorgeous.” What better year to read her words than this one, I wonder. Meanwhile, Pierce’s chapter begins with the bright red blanket in a haunting painting of Apache leader Geronimo, a reminder of the continuing fight for Indigenous sovereignty.In our Opinion section, artist Rose B. Simpson (Santa Clara Pueblo) took up this question in a moving statement in support of the Institute of American Indian Arts, a nexus of Native and Indigenous art of all kinds, after the Trump administration threatened its funding. Scholar Clementine Bordeaux (Sicangu Lakota Oyate) provided a true history of Mount Rushmore, first and still known as Six Grandfathers, that you won’t get from a park tour. “Our eyes are trained to see the four awful faces of settler violence,” she writes. “But I still see the Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe and all the non-human relatives that will continue to exist in the region beyond white supremacy.”\n\n                        Perhaps more than any other, this year in editing has only strengthened what artists and art writers do. We say the quiet part out loud, and we leave a record of our refusals and dreams. In 2026, Hyperallergic’s work of pushing our art worlds forward will be as important and vital as ever. Please consider supporting our work as a paying member — which, among other perks, enables you to comment on our articles.

But you don’t. Why?Because Krampus has his role and I’ve got mine! I think it’s weird that the Tooth Fairy takes teeth, but that’s not my job either.So your job is to judge people, but not to judge people for judging people.You’re making it sound like I approve of Krampus’s methods. I don’t. Just because you share a holiday with someone doesn’t mean you agree with them on everything. I love kids.Sandy Ernest Allen confronts their Harry Potter fandom as a trans person for Literary Hub (spoiler — it involves a bonfire):In reality, the number one lesson of the Harry Potter series was, ironically: We’re all humans deserving of equal rights, even the “weirdest” amongst us, even those most discarded by our families and/or by society, even those who’ve been caught up in histories we ourselves don’t yet understand. We’re all people deserving of love and respect and dignity. [...]What to do about this situation, I myself had not been sure. I was an adult and not especially “into” the series (as some adults are). I’d still comfort-binge the movies if they were marathoning on a hotel TV perhaps and I felt the right sort of depressed. But now I’d walk into my office and see her books there on my shelf—and feel sick about the whole situation.There will soon be an artist living in New York City's Gracie Mansion — Rama Duwaji, wife of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, sat for a profile and photoshoot with The Cut, and the internet is atwitter:\n\nThe best latte art in all of antiquity:\ni bet she was the best barista at the carthaginian coffee shop pic.twitter.com/ptW6bu0ll8— romanistani state-affiliated media (@djangofetts) December 17, 2025 \nIf you've been in the art world for any length of time, you know about the near-cultish obsession with Julia Cameron's 1992 self-help book The Artist's Way:\n\nThe plot twist I've been waiting for in every Hallmark Christmas movie:\n\nFinding the holiday spirit in the most unexpected of places — that's what it's all about.

David Lynch, a filmmaker so revolutionary that his style became a new standard. Frank Gehry, the sculptor of skylines. Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, the multi-hyphenate force of Indigenous aesthetics. Alonzo Davis, who was one of the first Black gallerists in this country and didn't stop there. Koyo Kouoh, who would have been the first African woman to direct the Venice Biennale. And so many more.Below are 20 luminaries we've lost this year, ordered by when they passed. Our ongoing weekly column In Memoriam offers a fuller picture of those who've gone and the marks they left. As we enter the new year, we carry them with us. — Lisa Yin Zhang, associate editorDavid Lynch (b. 1946)Filmmaker who conjured the uncannyDavid Lynch (photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)The multi-hyphenate film director and artist's work was so influential that it became integral to the tropes and aesthetics of cinematic horror, surrealism, and melodrama. He is known for classics both cult and traditional, from Blue Velvet (1986) to Mulholland Drive (2001), and many more.Read the obituaryJo Baer (b. 1929)Painter of \"radical figuration\"Jo Baer in 2020 (© Yaël Temminck)She initially rose to prominence during the burgeoning male-dominated Minimalism movement of the 1960s and '70s before rejecting the art form in favor of more experimental and figurative compositions. A sharp writer, she penned letters to editors, statements, and articles that at times ostracized her from her peers for her unswerving defense of painting.Read the obituaryJaune Quick-to-See Smith (b. 1940)Indigenous visual artist, curator, and activistJaune Quick-to-See Smith (photo by Grace Roselli, courtesy the Estate of Jaune Quick-to-See Smith and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York)Her prolific arts practice merged piercing humor and profound sociopolitical commentary with poetic depictions of Native American life. Her five-decade oeuvre spans painting, collage, drawing, print, and sculpture, exemplifying her lifelong refusal to be defined by any singular narrative.Read the obituaryAlonzo Davis (b. 1942)Artist and one of the first Black gallerists in the USA black-and-white portrait of Alonzo Davis (image courtesy Alonzo Davis Studios; all photos courtesy Parrasch Heijnen gallery)He and his brother Dale co-founded Brockman Gallery, the first major Black-owned contemporary gallery in Los Angeles, in 1967. Over a six-decade career, he continued to champion Black American art and culture, and created abstract mixed-media paintings, wall pieces, and murals.Read the obituaryMel Bochner (b. 1940)Pioneering conceptual artistMel Bochner at Villa Sciarra, Rome, 1985 (photo by Lizbeth Marano, courtesy Bochner Studio and Peter Freeman, Inc., New York/Paris)He treated language as a medium rather than a tool, upending contemporary art in the process. His vibrant thesaurus paintings and experimental installations explored the relationship between language, mathematics, and perception while challenging traditional canvas boundaries.Read the obituaryDorgham Qreiqea (b. 1997)Palestinian muralist and oil painterA photo from 2022 of Palestinian artist Dorgham Qreiqea with one of his figurative paintings (photo courtesy Dorgham Qreiqea's Facebook profile)A skilled muralist, oil painter, and portrait artist, he exhibited in Gaza's now-destroyed arts spaces, including Shababeek for Contemporary Art. Dedicated to community empowerment, he worked on a mask painting project during the COVID-19 pandemic and served as coordinator for an art-related youth group. On March 18, he was killed by an Israeli airstrike on Gaza.Read the obituaryNona Faustine (b. 1977)Photographer who confronted centuries of violenceNona Faustine (photo by Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images)Grounded in extensive research, Faustine’s photography often explored complex concepts of legacy, representation, trauma, and identity as they related to racial and gender stereotypes. She was best known for her self-portrait series White Shoes (2012–21), in which she posed nude or partially clothed in symbolic white heels at various former slave auction sites across New York.Read the obituaryMax Kozloff (b. 1933)Intrepid art critic and photographerMax Kozloff in an undated photo (photo courtesy Joyce Kozloff)A leading voice in 20th-century art criticism, Kozloff paved the way for political examinations of postwar art in his canonical essay “American Painting During the Cold War” (1973). He authored more than a dozen books, and was an editor and critic at various magazines.Read the obituaryDara Birnbaum (b. 1946)Video art’s “Wonder Woman”Dara Birnbaum in her solo show at Osservatorio Fondazione Prada in Milan, 2023 (photo by Francesca D’Amico, courtesy Marian Goodman Gallery)Over a half-century career, she spliced, resequenced, and repeated excerpts from sources as diverse as game show quizzes, sports programming, soap operas, and YouTube videos to explore and manipulate how information is disseminated, transformed, and assimilated. Read the obituaryMatthew Courtney (b. 1959)Downtown NYC artist who platformed othersCourtney making a cardboard sign at his Soho sidewalk gallery Steps to Nowhere (photo by and courtesy Fly Orr)A founding member of the grassroots Lower East Side arts nonprofit ABC No Rio, he hosted its celebrated Wide Open Cabaret series from the mid-1980s through early ’90s. He was a longtime fixture of Soho's street community, as seen in his makeshift, sidewalk-based Steps to Nowhere Gallery.Read the obituaryKoyo Kouoh (b. 1967)Cameroonian curator tapped for 61st Venice BiennaleA 2023 portrait of Koyo Kouoh at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (MOCAA) in Cape Town (photo by Marco Longari/AFP, courtesy the museum)Appointed as the next Venice Biennale's artistic director in December, Kouoh would have been the first African woman to oversee the international exhibition. She also served as the executive director and chief curator of Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (MOCAA).Read the obituaryDaniel Lelong (b. 1933)Co-founder of Galerie LelongDaniel Lelong in 2009 at Galerie Lelong in Paris (photo courtesy Galerie Lelong)He collaborated with some of the 20th century’s most well-known artists, including Joan Miró and Francis Bacon, and co-founded his namesake galleries in Paris and New York. He also made scholarly contributions to the careers of these artists, publishing a monograph of Calder’s work in 1971 and some of Miró's catalogue raisonnés. Read the obituaryJoel Shapiro (b. 1941)Sculptor of emotive figuresJoel Shapiro in 2024 (photo by Kyle Knodell, courtesy Pace Gallery)He was known for monumental bronze figures that transcended Minimalism with emotive, quasi-abstract forms resembling stick figures in motion. His work includes more than 30 public commissions and pieces in major collections worldwide.Read the obituary Raymond Saunders (b. 1934)Portrait of American artist Raymond Saunders (1970s) (photo by Anthony Barboza/Getty Images)He was a cult-like figure in the Bay Area art community. On idiosyncratic blackboard surfaces, he integrated chalk notation and assemblage to plumb the depths of lived experience and racial identity.Read the obituaryAgnes Gund (b. 1938)Champion of arts and equityAgnes Gund (photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images)A major collector and trustee at institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, she was also a staunch social justice advocate who fought for a more compassionate world. She founded the arts education nonprofit Studio in a School and launched the Art for Justice Fund to help end mass incarceration.Read the obituary Frank Wimberley (b. 1926)Endlessly experimental abstract expressionist Frank Wimberley in an undated photo (photo courtesy Berry Campbell Gallery)He was influenced by and an integral part of abstract expressionism and the Black Arts Movement, as well as a pillar of Long Island artist communities. “He explained the visions of artworks he still dreamt of making, sometimes waking him up in the night, enlivened with creative energy,” critic Jasmine Weber writes. “Into his final year, Frank Wimberley was still ripping, tearing, pasting, and painting paper to create new worlds.”Read the obituary Carla Stellweg (b. 1942)Visionary of Latin American ArtCarla Stellweg in Cuernavaca in August 2024 (photo by and courtesy Tessa Morefield)The fearless curator and writer shifted the very ground of Mexican contemporary art at a critical juncture for the country’s history and identity. From her work at Mexico's Museo de Arte Moderno in the 1970s to founding galleries in New York, she challenged institutional hierarchies throughout her career.Read the obituaryJackie Ferrara (b. 1929)Sculptor who contained chaos in geometric formsJackie Ferrara in New York on February 13, 2025 (photo by Jason Schmidt, courtesy the Jackie Ferrara Foundation)A fixture of New York’s downtown art scene, she discovered her visual language of graceful wooden structures and architectural environments while renovating her Soho loft. She saw her art as puzzles to be solved, and her public sculptures dot midwestern towns. \"Ferrara might have sought to contain the chaos of her life in precise, geometric forms,\" Zoë Lescaze writes, \"but their subtle unpredictability reflects her own.\"Read the obituary Alison Knowles (b. 1933)The first woman of FluxusAlison Knowles at home in New York in 2014 (photo by and courtesy Jason Bergman for Lucky Peach)A powerhouse of postwar experimental art and a co-founder of the Fluxus movement, she exploded the boundaries of every form she inhabited, including sculpture, process-based art, computer art, and more. She will be remembered for her radical interventions in form, her emphasis on the poetry in the physical world, and her insistence on art as a lived form.  Read the obituaryFrank Gehry (b. 1929)Sculptor of buildingsFrank Gehry on July 7, 2021 in Arles, France (photo by Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images)He made iconic postmodernist designs for museums, libraries, and concert halls, with the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao being his most instantly recognizable work. He was a \"true original,\" Mary Anne Gilmartin, an architect who worked with Gehry, told Hyperallergic. \"An artist, an architect, and a fearless visionary who changed the way we experience cities.\"Read the obituary\n                  \n                      \n                        In Memoriam\n                      \n                      \n                        Obituaries\n                      \n                      \n                        Community\n                      \n                      \n                        Best of 2025\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

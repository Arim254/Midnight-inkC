The sto­ry of the <em>Doc­tor Who</em> theme’s cre­ation is almost as inter­est­ing as the tune itself, with its “swoop­ing, hiss­ing and puls­ing” that “man­ages to be at once haunt­ing, goofy and ethe­re­al.” Just above, you can see Der­byshire and her assis­tant Dick Mills tell it in brief.</p>\n<p>What we learn from them is fas­ci­nat­ing, con­sid­er­ing that com­po­si­tions like this are now cre­at­ed in pow­er­ful com­put­er sys­tems with dozens of sep­a­rate tracks and dig­i­tal effects. The <em>Doc­tor Who</em> theme, on the oth­er hand, record­ed in 1963, was made even before basic ana­log syn­the­siz­ers came into use. “There are no musi­cians,” says Mills, “there are no syn­the­siz­ers, and in those days, we didn’t even have a 2‑track or a stereo machine, it was always mono.” (Despite pop­u­lar mis­con­cep­tions, the theme<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thereminworld.com/theremin-faq\"> does not fea­ture a Theremin</a>.) Der­byshire con­firms; each and every part of the song “was con­struct­ed on quar­ter-inch mono tape,” she says, “inch by inch by inch,” using such record­ing tech­niques as “fil­tered white noise” and some­thing called a “wob­bu­la­tor.” How were all of these painstak­ing­ly con­struct­ed indi­vid­ual parts com­bined with­out mul­ti­track tech­nol­o­gy? “We cre­at­ed three sep­a­rate tapes,” Der­byshire explains, “put them onto three machines and stood next to them and said “Ready, steady, go!” and pushed all the ‘start’ but­tons at once. It seemed to work.”</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZzTGT9k4_ow?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>The theme came about when Grain­er received a com­mis­sion from the BBC after his well-received work on oth­er series. He “com­posed the theme on a sin­gle sheet of A4 man­u­script,” writes Mark Ayres in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150206094054/http:/markayres.rwsprojects.co.uk/DWTheme.htm\">exten­sive online his­to­ry</a>, “and sent it over from his home in Por­tu­gal, leav­ing the Work­shop to get on with it.” Aware that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te\">musique con­crète</a> tech­niques Der­byshire and her team used “were very time-con­sum­ing, Grain­er pro­vid­ed a very sim­ple com­po­si­tion, in essence just the famous bass line and a swoop­ing melody,” as well as vague­ly evoca­tive instruc­tions for orches­tra­tion like “wind bub­ble” and “cloud.” Ayres writes, “To an inven­tive radio­phon­ic com­pos­er such as Delia Der­byshire, this was a gift.” Indeed “upon hear­ing it,” <em>The Atlantic</em> notes, “a very impressed Grain­er bare­ly rec­og­nized it as his com­po­si­tion. Due to BBC poli­cies at the time, Grainer—against his objections—is still offi­cial­ly cred­it­ed as the sole writer.” But the cred­it for this futur­is­tic work—which sounds absolute­ly like noth­ing else of the time and “which brought to a wide audi­ence meth­ods once exclu­sive to the high mod­ernism of exper­i­men­tal composition”—should equal­ly go to Der­byshire and her team. You can con­trast that ahead-of-its-time orig­i­nal theme with all of the iter­a­tions to fol­low in the video just above.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qsRuhCflRyg?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2015/06/hear-seven-hours-of-women-making-electronic-music-1938-2014.html\">Hear Sev­en Hours of Women Mak­ing Elec­tron­ic Music (1938- 2014)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2015/07/two-documentaries-introduce-delia-derbyshire-the-pioneer-in-electronic-music.html\">Two Doc­u­men­taries Intro­duce Delia Der­byshire, the Pio­neer in Elec­tron­ic Music</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Meet Four Women Who Pioneered Electronic Music: Daphne Oram, Laurie Spiegel, Éliane Radigue & Pauline Oliveros\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/06/4-women-who-pioneered-electronic-music-daphne-oram-laurie-spiegel-eliane-radigue-pauline-oliveros.html\">Meet Four Women Who Pio­neered Elec­tron­ic Music: Daphne Oram, Lau­rie Spiegel, Éliane Radigue & Pauline Oliv­eros</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>\n        \t</div>",

We use it to express mild sur­prise that one per­son could use both their left and right hemi­spheres equal­ly well. But in Leonardo’s day, peo­ple did not think of them­selves as hav­ing two brains, and the worlds of art and sci­ence were not so far apart as they are now.</p>\n<p>That Leonar­do was able to com­bine fine arts and fine engi­neer­ing may not have been over­ly sur­pris­ing to his con­tem­po­raries, though he was an extra­or­di­nar­i­ly bril­liant exam­ple of the phe­nom­e­non. The more we learn about him, the more we see how close­ly relat­ed the two pur­suits were in his mind.</p>\n<p>He approached every­thing he did as a tech­ni­cian. The uncan­ny effects he achieved in paint­ing were the result, as in so much Renais­sance art, of math­e­mat­i­cal pre­ci­sion, care­ful study, and first­hand obser­va­tion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2.png 765w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-240x182.png 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-360x273.png 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-300x227.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>His artis­tic projects were also exper­i­ments. Some of them failed, as most exper­i­ments do, and some he aban­doned, as he did so many sci­en­tif­ic projects. No mat­ter what, he nev­er under­took any­thing, whether mechan­i­cal, anatom­i­cal, or artis­tic, with­out care­ful plan­ning and design, as his copi­ous note­books tes­ti­fy. As more and more of those note­books have become avail­able online, both Renais­sance schol­ars and laypeo­ple alike have learned con­sid­er­ably more about how Leonardo’s mind worked.</p>\n<p>First, there was the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-codex-arundel-mapping-leonardo-s-working-life-the-british-library/5AUBtgGQK_TgJQ?hl=en\"><em>Codex Arun­del</em></a>. It is, writes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/12/leonardo-da-vinci-notebooks-art\">Jonathan Jones at <em>The Guardian</em></a>, “the liv­ing record of a uni­ver­sal mind”—but also, specif­i­cal­ly, the mind of a “technophile.” Then, the Vic­to­ria and Albert Nation­al Art Library <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html\">announced the dig­i­ti­za­tion of<em> Codex Forster</em></a>, which con­tains some of Leonardo’s ear­li­est note­books. Now The Visu­al Agency has released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">a com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em></a>, a huge col­lec­tion of the artist, engi­neer, and inventor’s fine­ly-illus­trat­ed notes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png 835w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-240x178.png 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-360x268.png 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-768x571.png 768w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-300x223.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“No oth­er col­lec­tion counts more orig­i­nal papers writ­ten by Leonar­do,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">notes Google</a>. The <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> “con­sists of 1119 papers, most of them drawn or writ­ten on both sides.” Its name has “noth­ing to do with the Atlantic Ocean, or with some eso­teric, mys­te­ri­ous con­tent hid­den in its pages.” The 12-vol­ume col­lec­tion acquired its title because the draw­ings and writ­ings were bound with the same size paper that was used for mak­ing atlases. Gath­ered in the 16th cen­tu­ry by sculp­tor Pom­peo Leoni, the papers descend­ed from Leonardo’s close stu­dent Gio­van Francesco Melzi, who was entrust­ed with them after his teacher’s death.</p>\n<p>The his­to­ry of the Codex itself makes for a fas­ci­nat­ing nar­ra­tive, much of which you can learn at Google’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">Ten Key Facts slideshow</a>. The note­books span Leonardo’s career, from 1478, when he was “still work­ing in his native Tus­cany, to 1519, when he died in France.” The col­lec­tion was tak­en from Milan by Napoleon and brought to France, where it remained in the Lou­vre until 1815, when the Con­gress of Vien­na ruled that all art­works stolen by the for­mer Emper­or be returned. (The emis­sary tasked with return­ing the Codex could not deci­pher Leonardo’s mir­ror writ­ing and took it for Chi­nese.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222010/Atlanticus3-e1557900402461.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">The Codex</a> con­tains not only engi­neer­ing dia­grams, anato­my stud­ies, and artis­tic sketch­es, but also fables writ­ten by Leonar­do, inspired by Flo­ren­tine lit­er­a­ture. And it fea­tures <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html\">Leonardo’s famed “CV,</a>” a let­ter he wrote to the Duke of Milan describ­ing in nine points his qual­i­fi­ca­tions for the post of mil­i­tary engi­neer. In point four, he writes, “I still have very con­ve­nient bomb­ing meth­ods that are easy to trans­port; they launch stones and sim­i­lar such in a tem­pest full of smoke to fright­en the ene­my, caus­ing great dam­age and con­fu­sion.”</p>\n<p>As if in illus­tra­tion, else­where in the Codex, the draw­ing above appears, “one of the most cel­e­brat­ed” of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">the col­lec­tion</a>.” It was “shown to trav­el­ing for­eign­ers vis­it­ing the Ambrosiana [the Bib­liote­ca Ambrosiana in Milan, where the Codex resides] since the 18th cen­tu­ry, usu­al­ly arous­ing much amaze­ment.” It is still amaz­ing, espe­cial­ly if we con­sid­er the pos­si­bil­i­ty that its artistry might have been some­thing of a byprod­uct for its cre­ator, whose pri­ma­ry moti­va­tion seems to have been solv­ing tech­ni­cal problems—in the most ele­gant ways imag­in­able.</p>\n<p>See the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> here.</a></p>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html\">Leonar­do da Vinci’s Ear­li­est Note­books Now Dig­i­tized and Made Free Online: Explore His Inge­nious Draw­ings, Dia­grams, Mir­ror Writ­ing & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/04/how-leonardo-da-vinci-drew-an-accurate-satellite-map-of-an-italian-city-1502.html\">How Leonar­do da Vin­ci Drew an Accu­rate Satel­lite Map of an Ital­ian City (1502)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Leonardo da Vinci’s Handwritten Resume (Circa 1482)\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html\">Leonar­do da Vinci’s Hand­writ­ten Resume (Cir­ca 1482)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Leonardo Da Vinci’s To-Do List from 1490: The Plan of a Renaissance Man\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/09/leonardo-da-vincis-to-do-list-from-1490.html\">Leonar­do Da Vinci’s To-Do List from 1490: The Plan of a Renais­sance Man</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>",

It was a momentous finale to a quarter-century odyssey that started at the cusp of the millennium and ended just last month. The road here was anything but straight, twisting through bureaucratic brambles and detours. Yet, isn’t every winding way toward belonging the true inheritance of wanderers at heart?</p>\n<p>Today, I stand at another crossroads. </p>\n<p>When Veken and I launched <em>Hyperallergic</em> in 2009, our venture was fueled by a love of art writing and the stubborn belief that an independent voice could thrive without the largesse of the 1%. My resolve to amplify stories untold and to champion marginalized voices ensured that we made waves in a stagnant art media pool, one where wealthy patrons preferred comfort over candor. Veken, for his part, proved naysayers wrong: Readers will rally for independent art writing, for stories rooted in fact, heart, and public good.</p>\n<p>Over 16 years, we became a home to over 2,500 voices while launching many into new fields. Together, we proved independence and criticality can flourish alongside a growing audience of readers invested in changing the landscape with thoughtful prose and electric ideas.</p>\n<p>Our work seeded new conversations. In-depth stories about archaeology, memes, social justice, protest, once peripheral, are now mainstream. Our playful candor, once ours alone among major art publications, is echoed in corporate outfits today. Authors who hatched their visions with us went on to bigger books and bolder inquiries. Through it all, we have relished the journey — sometimes after meeting a deadline, sometimes in the quiet aftermath. We are immensely proud of our role in shifting the discourse around art and its social impact and roles. It was a lot of work, but we got here.</p>\n<p>Making change in the field of contemporary art is never easy. When we began, we naïvely ignored the field’s idiosyncrasies — those invisible hands that stifle true journalism, laud superficial change or reform, and sometimes threaten to sap the joy from art’s urgent questions. But we persevered, cultivating a community of readers and writers who labor in and love the arts.</p>\n<p>Now, another transition: It’s time for a new Editor-in-Chief. Welcome, Hakim Bishara.</p>\n<p>A Palestinian writer, editor, curator, and artist, Hakim has authored some of the best reviews and opinions of the last few years, providing an unfiltered take on art that continued <em>Hyperallergic</em>’s commitment and work. Since joining <em>Hyperallergic </em>in 2019, he has woven his global and local instincts into every story. As Staff Reporter, Senior Editor, and most recently Managing Editor, he’s championed emerging and marginalized talent and encouraged us to look harder, dig deeper, and investigate issues we might have otherwise missed. His journalistic journey wound through international media, including contributions to <em>BBC</em>, <em>Euronews</em>, and more, touching on politics, art, and social change; his essays and criticism have appeared in <em>+972 Magazine</em>, the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>BOMB</em>, <em>Al Jazeera</em>, and beyond. In the last few years, Hakim has penned powerful reviews of exhibitions by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/916808/unspoken-truths-jenny-holzer-truisms-light-line-guggenheim-museum/\">Jenny Holzer</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/961351/ai-weiwei-knocks-down-the-building-blocks-of-empire/\">Ai Weiwei</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/995132/we-are-the-new-romantics-caspar-david-friedrich-met-museum/\">Caspar David Friedrich</a>, and an essay on the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1012944/the-fabricated-crisis-of-art-criticism/\">Fabricated Crisis of Art Criticism</a>,” which posited that “good art criticism <em>is</em> the crisis.”</p>\n<p>Hakim’s writing grapples with labor, funding, and representation, while maintaining a critical eye toward elitism and a heart for justice. He has received prestigious grants, holds an MFA in Art Writing from the School of Visual Arts, and studied law and international relations at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>I have a great deal of faith that Hakim will usher <em>Hyperallergic</em> into new, uncharted territories — challenging our old assumptions, forging fresh paths. Entrusting someone with the top role has long been my dream; now realized, I do so with confidence and anticipation.</p>\n<p>As for me: my role shifts to Editor-at-Large. My words, reviews, and reporting will continue on screens, in podcasts, and in more projects yet to come. But first, I’ll pause, as I step back a little to reflect on all we’ve built. In learning what it means to be an American, I am learning too to be less editor and more writer. I hope you will welcome Hakim to the helm of the best independent art publication anywhere as we continue to change and evolve. Under his watchful eye, I know <em>Hyperallergic</em> is in good hands.</p>\n\t</div>\n</article>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</section>",

In February, Edwards received a phone call <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/992061/show-on-artists-of-african-descent-loses-funding-amid-trump-dei-crackdown/\">informing her that the show had been terminated</a>. The Trump administration had allegedly labeled it a “DEI program and event” and withdrawn funding for the show, which had been previously secured under the Biden administration. </p>\n<p>President Trump signed an executive order banning DEI initiatives, established to provide individuals from marginalized communities and lower socioeconomic backgrounds with equal opportunities in the workforce, on his first day in office.</p>\n<p><em>Before the Americas</em> was one of the earliest casualties in a series of art exhibitions and performances axed in the wake of the administration’s mandate.

She estimates there were “about 50 or 60 donors” who allowed for the show to continue at a different location. “It really brought us closer together as an art community,” Edwards said, “and it shows that we really understand the importance of having art and culture in our society, and that art transcends politics and orders.”</p>\n<p>When word got out that <em>Before the Americas </em>had been terminated, Donald Russell, director of Mason Exhibitions, which runs the Gillespie Gallery, immediately opened its doors for it. Russell and Edwards had previously worked together in a different capacity, exhibiting her work. He had also been involved in the early stages of the exhibition in a consulting role. “I was absolutely prepared to take it on,” Russell told <em>Hyperallergic</em>.</p>\n<p>With bold color palettes and dynamic lines, the Afrocentric artworks represent the history of African-descendant artists. There’s striking power in Lois Mailou Jones’s 1996 silkscreen print of three African dancers, and subtle strength in Elizabeth Catlett’s “Niña” (1957), the profile of a young girl. </p>\n<p>“The history of African-descendant artists does not begin with slavery,” said Edwards. “That’s the whole point of this show.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=720%2C477&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=768%2C509&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1018&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1357&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=2000%2C1325&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=780%2C517&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=400%2C265&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2.jpg?resize=706%2C468&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Luis-Valdez-La-Roche2-1200x795.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Luis Vasquez La Roche, “The Cleanse (La Limpieza)” (2022)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p><em>Before the Americas</em> will be at Gillespie Gallery until November 15.

The event opened the Festival d’Automne — a three-month celebration of dance, theater, music, performance, and visual art — and marked the inauguration of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pinaultcollection.com/en/boursedecommerce/lygia-pape-weaving-space\"><em>Lygia Pape: Weaving Space</em></a>, the artist’s first solo exhibition in France at the Bourse de Commerce–Pinault Collection.</p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView-1200x846.jpg?resize=1200%2C846&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=1200%2C846&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=720%2C508&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=768%2C542&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=1536%2C1083&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=2048%2C1444&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=1024%2C722&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=2000%2C1410&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=780%2C550&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=400%2C282&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView.jpg?resize=706%2C498&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/LygiaPape_Tecelares_InstallationView-1200x846.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Installation view of Lygia Papes, works from <em>Tecelares</em> series (c. 1950s) in <em>Lygia Pape: Weaving Space</em> (photo by Eurídice Arratia/<em>Hyperallergic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>I arrived an hour before the performance and drifted through the rooms. The show is small but tightly curated, a compressed burst of some of Pape’s most emblematic works that showcases the breadth of her experimental practice across media. In one gallery, the short film “O ovo” (The Egg, 1967) plays. In it, Pape presses against the taut skin of a white cube on a beach, tears through, and crawls into the sand — geometry giving way to flesh. Across the room, a panoramic projection of “Divisor,” performed at Rio de Janeiro’s Museu de Arte Moderna in 2010, spans the wall. In a plexiglass case sits “Livro da Criação” (Book of Creation, 1959–60), a defining piece of Pape’s Neo-Concrete period. It takes the form of 16 artist books that unfold pop-up sculptural forms such as triangles flaring into fire, a fan unfurling a wheel, and a red disc becoming a clock — a cosmos animated by our hands. </p>\n<p>On display, too, is the monumental “Livro Noite e Dia III” (Book of Night and Day III, 1963–76), comprising 365 carved wooden units arranged into a shifting field of black, white, and gray that maps the daily swing between light and dark across a year. And a gorgeous grouping of the <em>Tecelares</em>, woodcut prints she made throughout the 1950s depicting labyrinthine geometric motifs, works as an anteroom for what is undoubtedly the showstopper: the dazzling “Ttéia 1, C” (2001–7), in which hundreds of copper wires stretch across a pitch-dark room lit by spotlights, an immersive sensory experience that itself changes with our movements.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-1200x800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=720%2C480&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1333&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=780%2C520&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=400%2C267&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-scaled.jpeg?resize=706%2C471&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/86fuf-1200x800.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Lygia Pape, “Livro Noite e Dia III” (Book of Night and Day III, 1963–76), tempera, latex, and acrylic on wood, 365 pieces (photo by Nicolas Brasseur/Pinault Collection, courtesy Projeto Lygia Pape)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Back on the street, “Divisor” expands that same participatory principle to a collective scale. More than 100 participants ducked under a long white sheet, their heads popping through slits, as they spilled out from the rear of La Bourse’s imposing neoclassical facade and glided like a giant white amoeba across the esplanade toward La Canopée des Halles. Phones held high, some filmed themselves and their fellow travellers. The mood was upbeat, buoyant; small children at the front gave the procession a playful air.</p>\n<p>Walking alongside this strange, lovely spectacle, it struck me that “Divisor” endures because it makes us <em>feel</em> collectivity as a physical condition rather than a concept — the brush of hair, the weight of fabric, the awkward give-and-take with strangers, freedom tested in public space. Yet this reenactment carries a trace of its own scaffolding — the museum, social media, the logic of the festival. In that sense, the Paris edition of “Divisor” felt less like a time capsule than a pulsing diagnostic: a fleeting republic stitched from cloth, bodies, and hashtags.</p>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-1200x1800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1800&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1800&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=720%2C1080&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1152&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1536&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=1365%2C2048&quality=90&ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=683%2C1024&quality=90&ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=2000%2C3000&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=780%2C1170&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=400%2C600&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?resize=706%2C1059&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-scaled.jpeg?w=1707&quality=90&ssl=1 1707w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/d0YDq-1200x1800.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Performance documentation of Lygia Pape, “Divisor” (2025) in Paris (photo by Souleymane Said, courtesy Projeto Lygia Pape)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pinaultcollection.com/en/boursedecommerce/lygia-pape-weaving-space\">Lygia Pape: Weaving Space</a> <em>continues at Bourse de Commerce – Pinault Collection (2 Rue de Viarmes, Paris, France) through January 26, 2026.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/almine-rech/\">Almine Rech</a> will close its gallery in London’s Mayfair district, Melanie Gerlis <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2025/10/03/almine-rech-closes-london-space-and-puts-uk-business-into-liquidation\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in the <em>Art Newspaper</em> on Friday. The space had been open for more than a decade, mounting shows for artists such as Javier Calleja, Chloe Wise, Jeff Koons, Esther Mahlangu, and many more.</p>\n<p>\n\tDealer Almine Rech, who founded her gallery in 1997 in Paris, told Gerlis that London remains “important” to her operation and that she “will open something” in the city in the future, without providing further specifics.</p>\n<p>\n\tGerlis also reported that Almine Rech’s London branch was put into liquidation. She referred to Companies House filings that suggest the gallery has a £6.3 million deficit. Rech said she did not owe money to artists, workers, or suppliers, and that the liquidation filing was “a technical step to restructure a lease that no longer aligned with our plans.”\n\t</p>\n<section>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t</h2>\n</section>\n<p>\n\tRech’s gallery will continue to operate the remaining eight locations, two of which are sited in Paris. The remaining six are spread across New York, Brussels, Shanghai, Monaco, and Gstaad.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer gallery opened in London in 2014 on Savile Row before moving two years later to Grosvenor Hill, placing Almine Rech next door to Gagosian, which continues to operate its space there. (Gagosian, for its  part, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/gagosian-closes-london-britannia-street-gallery-1234667513/\">closed another of its London galleries</a> in 2023 after 19 years.)</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier this year, dealer Almine Rech <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/uk-new-tax-non-dom-rules-art-market-effect-1234733561/\">told <em>ARTnews</em></a> that she had lost some of her London collectors after new tax rules were instituted in the UK. “Once people go away and settle somewhere else, usually they don’t come back—when money leaves a place, it is not good,” she said. She also added, “I believe the UK has a strong capacity to react.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTo what extent Brexit may have played a role in Rech’s decision was unclear based on Gerlis’s report. But  in 2023, some London dealers told <em>ARTnews</em> that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/london-art-market-frieze-paris-top-city-europe-1234681783/\">the British art market remained strong</a>, even as the one in France grows in prominence. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe last exhibition staged at its London gallery, a Gregor Hildebrandt solo show, closed on July 26.</p>\n</div>",

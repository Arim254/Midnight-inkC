    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nApart from a few bridges that still work, the infra­struc­tur­al achieve­ments of the Roman Empire exist, for us, most­ly as ruins. With a lit­tle imag­i­na­tion, those his­toric sites give us a clear enough sense of the empire’s sheer might, but if we want to go deep­er, we should then look into the numer­ous Roman con­struc­tions that haven’t sur­vived at all. In the video below from his chan­nel Told in Stone, ancient-his­to­ry YouTu­ber Gar­rett Ryan gives his per­son­al top sev­en “lost Roman won­ders,” begin­ning with Trajan’s Bridge, whose length of more than a kilo­me­ter across the Danube made it the longest bridge ever built at that time: a project of ambi­tions befit­ting a man that his­to­ry remem­bers as one of the “Five Good Emper­ors.”\nNo such sta­tus for Nero, though he did com­mis­sion the Subi­a­co Dams. Nec­es­sary to cre­ate a series of arti­fi­cial lakes beneath the infa­mous ruler’s vil­la, they were the high­est dams in exis­tence until the Mid­dle Ages. Hadri­an’s more pub­lic-mind­ed white-mar­ble tem­ple at Cyz­i­cus in mod­ern-day Turkey was known as unusu­al­ly splen­did even by the stan­dards of that genre of build­ing; now only its foun­da­tions remain, with archae­o­log­i­cal digs turn­ing up the occa­sion­al frag­ment.\nIn the for­mer Con­stan­tino­ple, the Church of the Holy Apos­tles is remem­bered as the sec­ond-most famous van­ished ear­ly Chris­t­ian church, after only the old St. Peter’s Basil­i­ca in Rome. Hagia Sophia may still be around, but the Col­umn of Jus­tin­ian that once stood between it and the Great Palace was melt­ed down for scrap long ago.\n\n\n\t\n\nWe only know of these lost struc­tures because we have his­tor­i­cal attes­ta­tions of their exis­tence, most vivid­ly in paint­ings: take the Pyra­mid of Romu­lus, a strik­ing tomb that appears near the Vat­i­can in The Vision of the Cross, which Raphael’s assis­tants pro­duced after his death. Oth­ers, like the Colos­sus of Nero from which the Colos­se­um takes its name, are rep­re­sent­ed on coins. In the video at the top, Ryan cov­ers three more “for­got­ten Roman megapro­jects”: Claudius’ tun­nel of record-mak­ing length through the moun­tain between the Riv­er Liris and the Fucine Lake, Tra­jan’s mil­i­tary high­way through the “Iron Gates” of the Danube, and Octa­vian’s secret har­bor at Lake Aver­nus. In our time, of course, there are no more emper­ors, Roman or oth­er­wise, and we’re sure­ly bet­ter off for it. But we can still admire — to use a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­cept — the state capac­i­ty they com­mand­ed.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Genius Engi­neer­ing of Roman Aque­ducts\nThe Roman Colos­se­um Decon­struct­ed: 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals the Hid­den Tech­nol­o­gy That Pow­ered Rome’s Great Are­na\nThe Amaz­ing Engi­neer­ing of Roman Baths\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMad­man or vision­ary? A lit­tle of both? A genius? A brand? A men­sch? David Lynch was all these things and more, and this fan-made video above serves as a quick reminder of the career and the con­sis­ten­cy of the film director/artist/transcendental med­i­ta­tor who passed away last year.\nEar­ly in the video we see one of the director’s pub­lic­i­ty stunts, when he sat in a chair on the cor­ner of La Brea and Hol­ly­wood, next to a cow and a large poster of Lau­ra Dern. No, the cow had noth­ing to do with the film he was promoting—2006’s Inland Empire—but it did stop traf­fic and draw atten­tion. Lynch didn’t have an adver­tis­ing bud­get to pro­mote Lau­ra Dern’s lead role in the film, so the cow had to do.\nLau­ra Dern appeared in a major­i­ty of Lynch’s films begin­ning with 1986’s Blue Vel­vet, and the video hon­ors their friend­ship (he called her “Tid­bit”) as well as his col­lab­o­ra­tions with Kyle MacLach­lan (who Lynch called “Kale”) and Nao­mi Watts. All three obvi­ous­ly adored him.\nThere’s also a com­pi­la­tion of Lynch swear­ing like a champ. Prod­uct place­ment in film is “bull­shit,” prob­lems on set are “fuck­ing nuts,” and for those who sat through the “peanut sweep­ing” scene in Twin Peaks The Return, you’ll under­stand his out­burst on set: “Who gives a fuc&ing $hit how long a scene is?”\nWe’ve linked pre­vi­ous­ly to Lynch’s video where he makes quinoa, and this short edit sums up that video nice­ly. It’s also nice to see atten­tion giv­en to The Straight Sto­ry, which usu­al­ly gets passed over in his fil­mog­ra­phy, despite (or maybe because of) being his sweet­est movie.\nThere’s also a reminder that Lynch made videos from quar­an­tine in his Los Ange­les home. Not only did he deliv­er the dai­ly weath­er reports like he used to, but he also announced “Today’s Num­ber,” which caused quite a lot of anx­i­ety in the YouTube com­ments. (Why no sev­en? WHY NO NUMBER 7?)\nThe video ends with Lynch’s the­o­ry about catch­ing ideas like fish—we’ve also high­light­ed this before—and then a love­ly mon­tage of title cards, remind­ing us all that “Direct­ed by David Lynch” remains a guar­an­teed sign of qual­i­ty.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nTwin Peaks Actu­al­ly Explained: A 4‑Hour Video Essay Demys­ti­fies It All\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nDavid Lynch Made a Dis­turb­ing Web Sit­com Called “Rab­bits”: It’s Now Used by Psy­chol­o­gists to Induce a Sense of Exis­ten­tial Cri­sis in Research Sub­jects\nPat­ti Smith and David Lynch Talk About the Source of Their Ideas & Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tThe British Museum in London stripped the word “Palestinian” from some of its displays about the Middle East amid pressure from a prominent pro-Israel group.\n\n\tThe Telegraph reported this weekend that UK Lawyers for Israel had written a letter to Nicholas Cullinan, the museum’s director, seeking the removal of that word, specifically in texts that referred to certain peoples as being “of Palestinian descent.”\n\n\t“Applying a single name – Palestine – retrospectively to the entire region, across thousands of years, erases historical changes and creates a false impression of continuity,” the group reportedly wrote. “It also has the compounding effect of erasing the Kingdoms of Israel and of Judea, which emerged from around 1000 BC, and of re-framing the origins of the Israelites and Jewish people as erroneously stemming from Palestine. The chosen terminology in the items described above implies the existence of an ancient and continuous region called Palestine.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe group, known as UKLFI for short, has previously been accused of taking action against individuals and institutions that have voiced support for Palestine. In August of last year, one legal complaint against the group alleged “a seeming pattern of vexatious and legally baseless correspondence aimed at silencing and intimidating Palestine solidarity efforts.”\n\n\tThe group’s advocacy has on one notable occasion targeted a museum in the past. After the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, England, showed a work by Forensic Architecture that came with a statement of solidarity in support of Palestine, UKLFI sought the ejection of the museum’s director, Alistair Hudson. He was then asked to leave and promptly departed, in what one museum-focused organization called a “forced resignation.”\n\n\tThe letter to the British Museum appears to have led to at least one change already. The Telegraph reported that that change was made to a map of the New Kingdom that previously described Egyptian forces as having “dominance in Palestine.”\n\n\t“It is understood that ‘Palestinian descent’ has been changed to read ‘Canaanite descent’ in the Hyksos panel,” the Telegraph reported.\n\n\tA museum spokesperson said in a statement, “For the Middle East galleries for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BC. We use the UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, for example Gaza, West Bank, Israel, Jordan, and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.”\n\t\n\n\tThe museum spokesperson told ARTnews that that the changes were made last year, prior to the UKLFI letter. The Telegraph report did not state when UKLFI sent its letter to Cullinan.\n\n\tWhile it remains unclear just how many changes to wall texts at the museum were made, UKLFI greeted the Telegraph report as a victory.\n\n\t“We welcome the British Museum’s willingness to review and amend terminology which is inaccurate or liable to convey an incorrect meaning today,” the UKLFI said in a statement. “The finding of its audience testing, that the term ‘Palestine’ is in some circumstances no longer meaningful is relevant to and should be taken on board by other museums and cultural institutions. Museums play a vital role in public education, and it is essential that descriptions reflect the historical record with precision and neutrality. These changes are an important step toward ensuring visitors receive an accurate understanding of the ancient Near East.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tWassily Kandinsky’s Le Rond Rouge (1939) will headline Christie’s 20th/21st Century evening sale in London on March 5. The house has slapped at £15.5 million high estimate on the Russian modernist heavyweight’s painting, which measures 35 inches by 45.7 inches.It was painted when Kandinsky lived in Paris with his wife Nina toward the end of his career. The couple moved to France from Germany in 1933 to escape the growing hostility of the Nazi regime. Kandinsky quickly immersed himself in the Paris’ avant-garde art circles and developed a new visual vocabulary that pushed his work into unexpected directions.“Le Rond Rouge is recognized as a key work from Kandinsky’s Paris period: a powerful, vibrant and large scale expression of his enduring commitment to abstraction, experimentation, and the emotional power of colour and form,” Keith Gill, Christie’s vice-chairman of 20th/21st century art, said in a statement. “It is an honour to present this masterpiece in our London season, as I remember the work well from its long-term loan to The Courtauld Gallery [from 2002 to 2018].”The composition centers on a bold red circle amid playful biomorphic forms and geometric shapes, suggesting a break from convention. Typical of Kandinsky’s late style, it blends Surrealist influences with his signature Bauhaus abstraction. Le Rond Rouge remained in Kandinsky’s personal collection until his death in 1944, passing to his widow Nina, who inherited works that he believed best represented his artistic vision. Its subsequent provenance includes Galerie Maeght, the Swiss collector Gustav Zumsteg, and the Fridart Collection, and it was last sold at Sotheby’s New York in 2018 for $20.6 millionAlso headlining Christie’s 20th/21st Century evening sale is a fresh-to-auction Henry Moore sculpture titled King and Queen (1952-53). The 64-inch-tall bronze has a £15 million ($20.5 million) high estimate. Katherine Arnold, Christie’s vice chairman of 20th/21st century art and head of post-war and contemporary art for Europe, told ARTnews that the bronze is “the most exciting sculpture I’ve ever seen brought to market.”\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tBoth works will be on public view at Christie’s London from February 25. \n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\tHenrike Naumann, a sculptor whose installations composed of furniture and design objects associated with East Germany’s troubled past made her a star of the German art scene, died on Saturday at 41.\n\n\tHer death preceded one of her biggest projects to date: the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, where the Berlin-based artist is set to represent the nation alongside Sung Tieu this year. The Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen (ifa), the organization that facilitates the German Pavilion, said in a statement that she died of a “short, serious illness.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“With Henrike Naumann’s passing, we have lost not only a significant figure in contemporary German art, but also a warm-hearted, insightful, and highly committed individual,” ifa said. “Her legacy lives on – in her works, in the numerous international collaborations she initiated, and in the many people who were inspired by her thinking and work.”\n\n\tNaumann’s art was by turns disturbing, intriguing, and heartfelt, attesting to a Germany that remains unsettled well after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Often working with ready-made objects that she acquired and assembled to form installations, she produced art that seemed ordinary, perhaps even a little banal, which was by design. Her “aesthetic of reunification,” as she termed it, was intended to feel eerily familiar.\n\n\tShe sourced many of the objects through eBay Kleinanzeigen, a website through which Germans can sell their goods to one another. “I read and research a lot as part of my process, but I really start to create the language to express a certain idea in an installation by looking at what people do, at how they post their furniture—usually on my phone,” she told Pin-Up in 2022.\n\n\tIn another interview conducted that same year for Bomb, she said, “I love to look for things that I think cannot exist. And then it often turns out they do exist. And then I need to get them.”\n\n\tThe objects she acquired sometimes had histories that seemed impossibly rich. For one 2018 show at the Museum Abteiberg in Mönchengladbach, Germany, she featured a painted portrait of the conservative politician Birgit Breuel, who served as president of the controversial Treuhandanstalt, a holding firm that supervised East German assets following reunification. Naumann discovered the painting in the archives for Expo 2000, a World Expo held in Hanover that Breuel helped lead. Critic Kito Nedo reported in Frieze that the painting had been gifted by the United Arab Emirates to the German Pavilion at that event. “In this weird, telling picture, the capitalist manager is depicted as a force in the ‘wilderness’ of an empty, postsocialist landscape,” Nedo wrote.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHenrike Naumann, 14 Words, 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy the artist and MMK Frankfurt\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnother memorable installation from 2018, titled 14 Words, involved the acquisition of the entire interior of a flower shop. Shown at the MMK Frankfurt museum that year, the installation may have seemed innocent to those unfamiliar with the history surrounding it, which was decidedly dark. The piece’s title obliquely referred to the slogan used by a neo-Nazi; Naumann connected that white supremacist to the National Socialist Underground, a German group whose racist killings targeted such people as Enver Şimşek, a Turkish-born German who operated a flower shop in Nuremberg when he was murdered in 2000.\n\n\tYet the vast majority of the objects Naumann’s installations did not appear to contain objects imbued with narratives like that one. Ostalgie (Urgesellschaft), from 2019, featured a carpet, a couch, a rotary phone, and other objects that would have been familiar to most residents in the GDR. Naumann placed these objects on the wall of KOW gallery, where items that normally might have appeared on a wall—framed portraits and the like—were exhibited on the floor. With this exhibition, Naumann created “spaces that mixed Nazi lineages and ecstatic rave culture, the Stone Age and the GDR, to refute simplistic characterizations of the East before and after reunification,” Emily Watlington wrote in Art in America.\n\t\n\n\tHenrike Naumann was born in 1984 in Zwickau, East Germany. She spent much of her early years with her grandparents while her parents continued their studies. Her grandfather, Karl Heinz Jakob, worked in the GDR, and so, she told Bomb, “my early art education was impacted by a socialist understanding of art and education as things that should be accessible for everyone in society.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstallation of “Henrike Naumann: Re-education,” 2022, at SculptureCenter, New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy SculptureCenter\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRather than studying painting or sculpture, as artists tend to do, she instead enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts Dresden’s program for costume and stage design. Then, at the Film University Potsdam-Babelsberg, she studied set design for film and television productions, graduating in 2012. She attributed her artistic approach to her education. “I want to make sense of every angle, conceptually and literally,” she told Pin-Up.\n\n\tOne of her earliest mature works was an installation about the National Socialist Underground, the group that killed Şimşek, the subject of 14 Words. Some of the NSU’s members lived in Zwickau, the city where Naumann was born, though this didn’t come to light until 2011. The year afterward, Naumann produced Triangular Stories (2012), an installation containing what purported to be home videos belonging to NSU members. In fact, even though they seemed to have been shot in 1992, these videos had been newly produced by Naumann.\n\t\n\n\tIn the decade and a half after that installation, Naumann ascended quickly in Germany’s art scene. In 2022, she exhibited at Documenta 15 via the Ghetto Biennale, a participant that was nominated to bring on other artists of its choosing. This year, she will become one of the few East German artists ever to represent Germany at the Venice Biennale.\n\n\tInternationally, she was also beginning to receive greater exposure, thanks in part to her US debut at SculptureCenter in 2022. That show featured the installation Horseshoe Theory (2022), in which Naumann arranged chairs, stools, and other pieces of furniture in a U shape, referencing the theory that the right and the left wings are more aligned the further one moves from the political center. The work also alluded to a memeified version of this thinking that applied to chair design.\n\n\tViewers who knew little about the GDR might have struggled to keep up with Naumann’s references, but she insisted that her work remained legible to those audiences, if not on an intellectual level, then on an emotional one. “You can obviously bring in aspects of theory to be decoded, but furniture, to me, belongs to public, political memory,” she told Pin-Up.\n",

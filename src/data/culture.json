We use it to express mild sur­prise that one per­son could use both their left and right hemi­spheres equal­ly well. But in Leonardo’s day, peo­ple did not think of them­selves as hav­ing two brains, and the worlds of art and sci­ence were not so far apart as they are now.</p>\n<p>That Leonar­do was able to com­bine fine arts and fine engi­neer­ing may not have been over­ly sur­pris­ing to his con­tem­po­raries, though he was an extra­or­di­nar­i­ly bril­liant exam­ple of the phe­nom­e­non. The more we learn about him, the more we see how close­ly relat­ed the two pur­suits were in his mind.</p>\n<p>He approached every­thing he did as a tech­ni­cian. The uncan­ny effects he achieved in paint­ing were the result, as in so much Renais­sance art, of math­e­mat­i­cal pre­ci­sion, care­ful study, and first­hand obser­va­tion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2.png 765w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-240x182.png 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-360x273.png 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14221936/Atlanticus2-300x227.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>His artis­tic projects were also exper­i­ments. Some of them failed, as most exper­i­ments do, and some he aban­doned, as he did so many sci­en­tif­ic projects. No mat­ter what, he nev­er under­took any­thing, whether mechan­i­cal, anatom­i­cal, or artis­tic, with­out care­ful plan­ning and design, as his copi­ous note­books tes­ti­fy. As more and more of those note­books have become avail­able online, both Renais­sance schol­ars and laypeo­ple alike have learned con­sid­er­ably more about how Leonardo’s mind worked.</p>\n<p>First, there was the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-codex-arundel-mapping-leonardo-s-working-life-the-british-library/5AUBtgGQK_TgJQ?hl=en\"><em>Codex Arun­del</em></a>. It is, writes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/12/leonardo-da-vinci-notebooks-art\">Jonathan Jones at <em>The Guardian</em></a>, “the liv­ing record of a uni­ver­sal mind”—but also, specif­i­cal­ly, the mind of a “technophile.” Then, the Vic­to­ria and Albert Nation­al Art Library <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html\">announced the dig­i­ti­za­tion of<em> Codex Forster</em></a>, which con­tains some of Leonardo’s ear­li­est note­books. Now The Visu­al Agency has released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">a com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em></a>, a huge col­lec­tion of the artist, engi­neer, and inventor’s fine­ly-illus­trat­ed notes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4.png 835w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-240x178.png 240w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-360x268.png 360w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-768x571.png 768w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222024/Atlanticus4-300x223.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“No oth­er col­lec­tion counts more orig­i­nal papers writ­ten by Leonar­do,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">notes Google</a>. The <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> “con­sists of 1119 papers, most of them drawn or writ­ten on both sides.” Its name has “noth­ing to do with the Atlantic Ocean, or with some eso­teric, mys­te­ri­ous con­tent hid­den in its pages.” The 12-vol­ume col­lec­tion acquired its title because the draw­ings and writ­ings were bound with the same size paper that was used for mak­ing atlases. Gath­ered in the 16th cen­tu­ry by sculp­tor Pom­peo Leoni, the papers descend­ed from Leonardo’s close stu­dent Gio­van Francesco Melzi, who was entrust­ed with them after his teacher’s death.</p>\n<p>The his­to­ry of the Codex itself makes for a fas­ci­nat­ing nar­ra­tive, much of which you can learn at Google’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">Ten Key Facts slideshow</a>. The note­books span Leonardo’s career, from 1478, when he was “still work­ing in his native Tus­cany, to 1519, when he died in France.” The col­lec­tion was tak­en from Milan by Napoleon and brought to France, where it remained in the Lou­vre until 1815, when the Con­gress of Vien­na ruled that all art­works stolen by the for­mer Emper­or be returned. (The emis­sary tasked with return­ing the Codex could not deci­pher Leonardo’s mir­ror writ­ing and took it for Chi­nese.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2019/05/14222010/Atlanticus3-e1557900402461.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">The Codex</a> con­tains not only engi­neer­ing dia­grams, anato­my stud­ies, and artis­tic sketch­es, but also fables writ­ten by Leonar­do, inspired by Flo­ren­tine lit­er­a­ture. And it fea­tures <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html\">Leonardo’s famed “CV,</a>” a let­ter he wrote to the Duke of Milan describ­ing in nine points his qual­i­fi­ca­tions for the post of mil­i­tary engi­neer. In point four, he writes, “I still have very con­ve­nient bomb­ing meth­ods that are easy to trans­port; they launch stones and sim­i­lar such in a tem­pest full of smoke to fright­en the ene­my, caus­ing great dam­age and con­fu­sion.”</p>\n<p>As if in illus­tra­tion, else­where in the Codex, the draw­ing above appears, “one of the most cel­e­brat­ed” of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">the col­lec­tion</a>.” It was “shown to trav­el­ing for­eign­ers vis­it­ing the Ambrosiana [the Bib­liote­ca Ambrosiana in Milan, where the Codex resides] since the 18th cen­tu­ry, usu­al­ly arous­ing much amaze­ment.” It is still amaz­ing, espe­cial­ly if we con­sid­er the pos­si­bil­i­ty that its artistry might have been some­thing of a byprod­uct for its cre­ator, whose pri­ma­ry moti­va­tion seems to have been solv­ing tech­ni­cal problems—in the most ele­gant ways imag­in­able.</p>\n<p>See the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> here.</a></p>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html\">Leonar­do da Vinci’s Ear­li­est Note­books Now Dig­i­tized and Made Free Online: Explore His Inge­nious Draw­ings, Dia­grams, Mir­ror Writ­ing & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/04/how-leonardo-da-vinci-drew-an-accurate-satellite-map-of-an-italian-city-1502.html\">How Leonar­do da Vin­ci Drew an Accu­rate Satel­lite Map of an Ital­ian City (1502)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Leonardo da Vinci’s Handwritten Resume (Circa 1482)\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html\">Leonar­do da Vinci’s Hand­writ­ten Resume (Cir­ca 1482)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to Leonardo Da Vinci’s To-Do List from 1490: The Plan of a Renaissance Man\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/09/leonardo-da-vincis-to-do-list-from-1490.html\">Leonar­do Da Vinci’s To-Do List from 1490: The Plan of a Renais­sance Man</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>",

The sto­ry of the <em>Doc­tor Who</em> theme’s cre­ation is almost as inter­est­ing as the tune itself, with its “swoop­ing, hiss­ing and puls­ing” that “man­ages to be at once haunt­ing, goofy and ethe­re­al.” Just above, you can see Der­byshire and her assis­tant Dick Mills tell it in brief.</p>\n<p>What we learn from them is fas­ci­nat­ing, con­sid­er­ing that com­po­si­tions like this are now cre­at­ed in pow­er­ful com­put­er sys­tems with dozens of sep­a­rate tracks and dig­i­tal effects. The <em>Doc­tor Who</em> theme, on the oth­er hand, record­ed in 1963, was made even before basic ana­log syn­the­siz­ers came into use. “There are no musi­cians,” says Mills, “there are no syn­the­siz­ers, and in those days, we didn’t even have a 2‑track or a stereo machine, it was always mono.” (Despite pop­u­lar mis­con­cep­tions, the theme<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thereminworld.com/theremin-faq\"> does not fea­ture a Theremin</a>.) Der­byshire con­firms; each and every part of the song “was con­struct­ed on quar­ter-inch mono tape,” she says, “inch by inch by inch,” using such record­ing tech­niques as “fil­tered white noise” and some­thing called a “wob­bu­la­tor.” How were all of these painstak­ing­ly con­struct­ed indi­vid­ual parts com­bined with­out mul­ti­track tech­nol­o­gy? “We cre­at­ed three sep­a­rate tapes,” Der­byshire explains, “put them onto three machines and stood next to them and said “Ready, steady, go!” and pushed all the ‘start’ but­tons at once. It seemed to work.”</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZzTGT9k4_ow?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>The theme came about when Grain­er received a com­mis­sion from the BBC after his well-received work on oth­er series. He “com­posed the theme on a sin­gle sheet of A4 man­u­script,” writes Mark Ayres in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150206094054/http:/markayres.rwsprojects.co.uk/DWTheme.htm\">exten­sive online his­to­ry</a>, “and sent it over from his home in Por­tu­gal, leav­ing the Work­shop to get on with it.” Aware that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te\">musique con­crète</a> tech­niques Der­byshire and her team used “were very time-con­sum­ing, Grain­er pro­vid­ed a very sim­ple com­po­si­tion, in essence just the famous bass line and a swoop­ing melody,” as well as vague­ly evoca­tive instruc­tions for orches­tra­tion like “wind bub­ble” and “cloud.” Ayres writes, “To an inven­tive radio­phon­ic com­pos­er such as Delia Der­byshire, this was a gift.” Indeed “upon hear­ing it,” <em>The Atlantic</em> notes, “a very impressed Grain­er bare­ly rec­og­nized it as his com­po­si­tion. Due to BBC poli­cies at the time, Grainer—against his objections—is still offi­cial­ly cred­it­ed as the sole writer.” But the cred­it for this futur­is­tic work—which sounds absolute­ly like noth­ing else of the time and “which brought to a wide audi­ence meth­ods once exclu­sive to the high mod­ernism of exper­i­men­tal composition”—should equal­ly go to Der­byshire and her team.

There would be plen­ty of oth­er women, but none who played quite the same role in his life as Mar­ić, not only the moth­er of his chil­dren, but also — accord­ing to some his­to­ri­ans — a col­lab­o­ra­tor on some of his accom­plish­ments in physics. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lostwomenofscience.org/post/does-mileva-einstein-maric-deserve-credit-for-albert-einsteins-discoveries\">Accord­ing to Lost Women of Sci­ence</a>, “there is lit­tle tan­gi­ble evi­dence to sup­port the claims that Mar­ić was a co-author of Einstein’s first major work.

Antho­ny Burgess’ har­row­ing, lin­guis­ti­cal­ly inven­tive nov­el of a grim near future has come out on top in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pen.org/banned-books-list-2025/\">PEN Amer­i­ca’s lat­est rank­ing of banned books</a>: that is, books removed or pre­vent­ed even from enter­ing pub­lic school libraries, most com­mon­ly in the state of Flori­da, with Texas and Ten­nessee as run­ners-up. Fur­ther down the list appears anoth­er wide­ly known dystopi­an saga, Mar­garet Atwood’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4oc8i6x\"><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></a>; Toni Mor­rison’s tale of Depres­sion-era race rela­tions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nBZyGG\"><em>The Bluest Eye</em></a>; and even such long-pop­u­lar “young adult” stan­dards as Judy Blume’s <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/42uR1wW\">For­ev­er</a>…</em> and Stephen Chbosky’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/42w4NPP\"><em>The Perks of Being a Wall­flower</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Since its pub­li­ca­tion in 1962, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3IJzMRV\"><em>A Clock­work</em> <em>Orange</em></a> has faced mul­ti­ple book ban­ning attempts due to the sex­u­al vio­lence it depicts,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bannedbooks.library.cmu.edu/a-clockwork-orange/\">says Carnegie Mel­lon Uni­ver­si­ty’s Banned Books Project</a>. “In 1973, a book­seller in Orem, Utah, was arrest­ed for sell­ing the nov­el along with two oth­er ‘obscene’ books.”</p>\n<p>Bans fol­lowed “in 1976 in Auro­ra, Col­orado, in 1977 in West­port, Con­necti­cut, and in 1982 in Annis­ton, Alaba­ma. As recent­ly as 2019, mem­bers of the Flori­da Cit­i­zens Alliance” — in yet anoth­er exam­ple of the sur­pris­ing ten­den­cy toward cul­tur­al author­i­tar­i­an­ism in the Sun­shine State — “have lob­bied to ban the book along with almost one hun­dred oth­er ‘porno­graph­ic’ nov­els.”</p>\n<p>The noto­ri­ety of <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3IJzMRV\">A Clock­work Orange</a> </em>in this regard prob­a­bly owes some­thing to the steely lurid­ness of Stan­ley Kubrick­’s film adap­ta­tion, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/when-stanley-kubrick-banned-a-clockwork-orange.html\">which was banned in Eng­land by Kubrick him­self</a>. It makes, in any case, for an iron­ic object of a book ban, giv­en its themes. Burgess was inspired to write this nov­el of juve­nile ultra-delin­quen­cy, as he explains in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jYOqu4b9BY\">the inter­view clip above</a>, by “talk in the nine­teen-six­ties of the pos­si­bil­i­ty of get­ting these young thugs and not putting them in jail, because jail is need­ed for pro­fes­sion­al crim­i­nals, but rather putting them through a course of con­di­tion­ing” to make them behave less like organ­isms than machines: the “clock­work oranges” of the title. The state, it seemed, “was all too ready to take over our brains and turn us into good lit­tle cit­i­zens with­out the pow­er of choice” — a process that plau­si­bly begins by restrict­ing the choice of read­ing mate­r­i­al.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/03/anthony-burgess-lists-his-five-favorite-dystopian-novels.html\"><em>A Clock­work Orange</em> Author Antho­ny Burgess Lists His Five Favorite Dystopi­an Nov­els: Orwell’s 1984, Huxley’s Island & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/10/anthony-burgess-names-the-99-best-novels-in-english.html\">Antho­ny Burgess Names the 99 Best Nov­els in Eng­lish Between 1939 & 1983: Orwell, Nabokov, Hux­ley & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/02/why-maya-angelous-memoir-i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-became-one-of-the-most-banned-books-of-all-time.html\">Why Maya Angelou’s Mem­oir <em>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</em> Became One of the Most Banned Books of All Time</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/01/the-brooklyn-public-library-gives-every-teenager-in-the-u-s-free-access-to-censored-books.html\">The Brook­lyn Pub­lic Library Gives Every Teenag­er in the U.S. Free Access to Cen­sored Books</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/09/americas-first-banned-book-discover-the-1637-book-that-mocked-the-puritans.html\">America’s First Banned Book: Dis­cov­er the 1637 Book That Mocked the Puri­tans</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/04/the-new-york-public-library-provides-free-online-access-to-four-banned-books-catcher-in-the-rye-stamped-more.html\">The New York Pub­lic Library Pro­vides Free Online Access to Banned Books: <em>Catch­er in the Rye</em>, <em>Stamped</em> & More</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Crouching down to reach her, the military fatigue-clad Volodimir stands on a train headed for the city of Kramatorsk in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. He’s on his way to the battlefield to fight Russia’s invasion.</p>\n<p>Taken by Ilvy Nijokiktijen, the photo capturing this heartwrenching moment is one of nearly 200 included in a book and large-scale exhibition at <a href=\"https://www.fenix.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Fenix,</a> a new art museum in Rotterdam that focuses entirely on migration. <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/96/9789464941562\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Family of Migrants</em></a> takes a broad look at human movement from 1905 to the present day, citing a wide array of reasons someone might relocate from war and economic crises to exile and internment to a search for opportunities abroad.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5.jpg\" alt=\"a photo by Ilvy Nijokiktijen of a young woman crying while she holds the hand of a soldier on a train\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Ilvy Nijokiktijen, Ukraine, 2022.

Courtesy of VII / Redux</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Spanning documentary, portraits, and photojournalism, the included images emerge from 136 photographers in 55 countries across 120 years. Providing such an expansive perspective of movement connects myriad experiences—from a Ukrainian soldier off to war to a young Afghan refugee to a poverty-stricken mother and her children—and is an attempt to broaden how we think of migration.</p>\n<p>“In every era, there has been movement of people, be it out of free will, out of necessity, or under pressure. Migration shapes the world, separating and connecting people, but when we talk about migration, the focus all too quickly shifts to figures or politics,” curator Hanneke Mantel says.</p>\n<p>The title references the 1955 Museum of Modern Art exhibition, <em>The Family of Man</em>. Curated by Edward Steichen, the bold exhibition included hundreds of photos that presented a narrative of global solidarity after World War II. Steichan wanted to depict “the gamut of life from birth to death,” a task Mantel seems to take on at Fenix by sharing a fuller story of migration today.</p>\n<p><em>The Family of Migrants</em>, published by <a href=\"https://hannibalbooks.be/en/soon\" target=\"_blank\">Hannibal Books</a>, includes photos by icons like Dorothea Lange and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/01/ernest-cole-the-true-america/\">Ernest Cole</a>, along with those working today like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/04/world-press-photos-2024/\">Alejandro Cegarra</a>.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>With its roots in the conceptual and immersive experiments of the Dadaists and Surrealists in the early 20th century, installation art emerged as its own genre in the late 1950s. The approach gained momentum during the next couple of decades, usually revolving around site-specific responses to interior spaces. Taking many forms, installations sometimes incorporate light, sound, projections, performances, and participatory or immersive elements.</p>\n<p>“While many of these works were made by women, histories of art have<br />tended to focus on male artists,” says a statement from <a href=\"https://www.mplus.org.hk/en/\" target=\"_blank\">M+</a> in Hong Kong, which is currently presenting <em>Dream Rooms: Environments by Women Artists 1950s-Now</em>. The show “addresses this imbalance by foregrounding the visionary contributions of women artists.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dream-9.jpg\" alt=\"a cushion filled room\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dream-9.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dream-9-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dream-9-960x641.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dream-9-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dream-9-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Pinaree Sanpitak, “The House Is Crumbling” (2017/2025), © Pinaree Sanpitak</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Dream Rooms</em> features 12 room-scale installations created by artists located across four continents. Originating at Haus der Kunst München in 2023 with the title <em>Inside Other Spaces, </em>the exhibition then traveled to M+, where the artworks have been reconstructed.</p>\n<p>Some pieces date back several decades, like Yamazaki Tsuruko’s “Red (shape of mosquito net)” from 1956 and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/Aleksandra-Kasuba\">Aleksandra Kasuba</a>’s “Spectral Passage” from 1975. “The exhibition explores forms and ideas that speak to their time, while also encouraging visitors to explore, laugh, wonder, or embrace feelings of unease,” the museum says.</p>\n<p>Three new works have been commissioned from three Asian artists specifically for this exhibition. These include Pinaree Sanpitak’s “The House Is Crumbling,” which was first conceived in 2017 and is reimagined for <em>Dream Rooms. </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/chiharu-shiota\">Chiharu Shiota</a>’s “Infinite Memory” features a cascade of the artist’s signature red string, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/Kimsooja\">Kimsooja</a>’s atmospheric “To Breathe” is composed of translucent film on window that diffracts the light into prismatic patterns around the museum.</p>\n<p><em>Dream Rooms </em>continues through January 18, 2026.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>When it comes to knitting complex motifs, a pattern is a needleworker’s best friend. But what if you want to customize one yourself? What about text? Fortunately, Zurich-based designer Rüdiger Schlömer wondered the same thing, resulting in a series of typefaces for knitting. Under the project umbrella of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/05/type-knitting-rudiger-schlomer/\">Typeknitting</a>, his new font is called <a href=\"https://www.knithello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Knit Hello</a>, which works by typing the digital letters into a word processing program like you would with any other font. As you go, a knitting pattern develops at the same time, making it easy to create a beginner-friendly design that you can endlessly customize.</p>\n<p>Download free trial fonts on the Typeknitting <a href=\"https://typeknitting.net/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, or purchase a style that meets the kind of knitting you do, whether on a machine or by hand. And say “hey” to two patterns for full fan scarves, available via Ravelry, on the Knit Hello <a href=\"https://www.knithello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6.jpg\" alt=\"a knitted, patchworked fabric that read \"HELLO\" in different languages\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2.jpg\" alt=\"a composite image of a knitted fabric that reads \"HI\" next to type that reads \"KNIT\" and \"TYPE\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-640x452.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-960x679.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-1536x1086.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4.jpg\" alt=\"digital typeface examples that read \"HEY,\" \"HOLA,\" \"CIAO,\" \"HI\" and \"SALUT,\" which double as knitting patterns\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-640x454.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-960x681.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-768x545.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-1536x1090.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1.jpg\" alt=\"a small knitted fabric piece that reads \"HELLO\" in red and white yarn, with knitting needles and yarn around it\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-640x452.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-960x679.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-1536x1086.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3.jpg\" alt=\"an image of a knitted alphabet in blue-and-white yarn next to a digital typeface that doubles as a knitting pattern\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-640x454.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-960x681.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-768x545.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-1536x1090.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7.jpg\" alt=\"a knitted red-and-white scarf with the word \"HELLO\" in numerous languages\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-640x445.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-960x668.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-768x534.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-1536x1068.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>",

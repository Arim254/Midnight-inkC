A remark­able col­lec­tion of this often reviled but end­less­ly fas­ci­nat­ing area of the Eng­lish lan­guage, it cov­ers slang from the past five cen­turies right up to the present day, from all the dif­fer­ent Eng­lish-speak­ing coun­tries and regions. Total­ing 10.3 mil­lion words and over 53,000 entries, the col­lec­tion pro­vides the def­i­n­i­tions of 100,000 words and over 413,000 cita­tions. Every word and phrase is authen­ti­cat­ed by gen­uine and ful­ly-ref­er­enced cita­tions of its use, giv­ing the work a lev­el of author­i­ty and schol­ar­ship unmatched by any oth­er pub­li­ca­tion in this field.”\nIf you head over to Ama­zon, that’s how you will find Green’s Dic­tio­nary of Slang pitched to con­sumers. The dic­tio­nary is an attrac­tive three-vol­ume, hard-bound set. But it comes at a price. $1,327.78.\nNow comes the good news. Green’s Dic­tio­nary of Slang has become avail­able as a free web­site, giv­ing you access to an even more updat­ed ver­sion of the dic­tio­nary. Col­lec­tive­ly, the web­site lets you trace the devel­op­ment of slang over the past 500 years. And, as Men­tal Floss notes, the site “allows lookups of word def­i­n­i­tions and ety­molo­gies for free, and, for a well-worth-it sub­scrip­tion fee, it offers cita­tions and more exten­sive search options.” If you’ve ever won­dered about the mean­ing of words like kid­ly­wink, gol­lier, and lint­head, you now know where to begin.\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nA parrot confined to a too-small cage, jellyfish floating above fungi and ferns, and a spotted octopus resting as the centerpiece to a flourishing bouquet are a few of the surreal scenes in the works of Martin Wittfooth. The artist is known for his enigmatic paintings that meld flora and fauna to consider interconnection and nature’s endurance.\nWittfooth currently splits his time between Savannah and Brockville, although he plans to relocate permanently to the latter this year. Before he begins preparing for a solo exhibition in spring 2027 with Hashimoto Contemporary, the artist is completing a few larger commissions. \n“Dam”\nHe enjoys the balance between larger bodies of work and singular pieces: “A unified field of concepts and vibes, to have all of the pieces in an exhibition have a kind of kindred dialogue going on between one another, and then when the dust settles in between shows, to have singular works to focus on, where I can slow down just a bit and let the new ideas start to form for the next show,” he says.\nAlong with Yuko Shimizu, Wittfooth will also mentor at the unique Quarantine residency this April. This is his third time participating in the program, and it’s one that informs much of the way he thinks about connection. He’s always impressed by “how quickly bonds form between the students, between the mentors, between the students and the mentors, and with the whole crew that runs the show,” he says, adding: \n\nThere’s been a lot of emphasis on this notion that community is important—as a species, we’ve appreciated this in our various ways for as long as we’ve been around—but for artists, this is often a bit of a struggle to develop and to maintain, considering the isolating nature of how we work. It’s also something that seems to have become more broadly murky and confused in this era of social media, with person-to-person contact being replaced by virtual interactions and projection of virtual selves—methods of communication that I personally feel are missing the essential ingredient of connection.\n\nYou can find more about the program on Colossal, and explore Wittfooth’s work on his website and Instagram.\n“Parallelism Jellyfish 2”\n“The Alchemist”\n“Parallelism Paradise”\n“Liberty”\n“Parallelism 9”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The show was co-curated by Eve Straussman-Pflanzer, who has since become the curator and head of Italian and Spanish Paintings at the NGA. Gentilischi created this work at the apex of her career upon her return to Rome. In an email to Hyperallergic, Straussman-Pflanzer stated that the artist's “strongest, and arguably most important” paintings were made in the early 1620s.“In this period, Artemisia Gentileschi offers the viewer her most confident pictures, including our newly acquired ‘Mary Magdalene,’ where the figures, male or female, are fully realized, sentient human beings,” she said.  The composition evokes Caravaggio's earlier rendition — stripped of the skull, cross, and ointment jar that usually accompanied the disciple in favor of depicting her cave-dwelling life in solitude after the ascension of Christ. Against the sparse backdrop of a dark cavern, Mary Magdalene is reclining with her eyes closed, her head tilted back to expose her neck. Gentileschi imbues the work's spiritual context with a sensual essence by showing Mary's unbound hair, exposed shoulder, and the crease between her underarm and breast. In her state of divine ecstasy, Mary Magdalene appears totally ignorant of the spectator, in spite of the forced proximity employed by the framing. \"Judith Slaying Holofernes\" (1620) by Artemisia Gentileschi (public domain via Wikimedia Commons)Gentileschi frequently interacted with viewers through her figurative subjects and self-portraits, often commanding authority through direct gaze, life-size scale, and confrontational depictions of biblical heroines. A celebrated artist throughout her life and long afterwards, Gentileschi is best known for combining feminine assertion and vulnerability through dramatic works such as “Judith Beheading Holofernes” (c. 1620) and “Susanna and the Elders” (1610). In the work recently acquired by the NGA, however, Mary Magdalene's fidelity and spiritual euphoria don't necessarily separate her from the viewer. “We feel and experience this conversion/change along with her,” Straussman-Pflanzer said.Acknowledging the significance of the acquisition, the curator emphasized the importance of conveying to the public that “women artists in the 17th-century were extremely accomplished.”“They were able to capture the power of human emotion and human experience — in this case religious conversion — and transmit it in a vivid and powerfully evocative picture that captures the complexity of human experience, especially that of a woman undergoing a profound emotional and mental change,” she continued. “This is Artemisia Gentileschi's gift,” Straussman-Pflanzer said.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        National Gallery of Art\n                      \n                      \n                        Artemisia Gentileschi\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

(all screenshots via Department of Justice)In a document containing photographs sent to Jeffrey Epstein’s personal email address, the Department of Justice (DOJ) made a curious redaction, placing a black square on the face of one of the most ubiquitous portraits in the world. While the DOJ faces intense scrutiny for releasing sensitive information about Epstein's victims, including social security numbers and uncensored nude photos, in its recent document release, the federal agency decided to cover the face of what appears to be a reproduction of Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.”The altered “Mona Lisa” appears in a document containing photographs emailed to Epstein in 2009, with the subject line “simply paris.” Several photos in the email portray a young couple, including a woman whose face is redacted and an unnamed man. Photos in the email show the young couple at famous tourist destinations in Paris, including the Arc de Triomphe and inside the Louvre Museum.Redacted photos in a July 2009 email to Epstein titled \"simply paris\"The redacted image of Mona Lisa appears to be a reproduction of the artwork, not the actual painting, though in another photograph in the email, an individual can be seen walking past the glass-covered painting hanging in the Louvre. “We just walked around all over the city not just the sight seeing [sic]... we took like 1500 pictures so was really difficult to decide wich [sic] to send!” the email, sent by a redacted contact, said.The email is dated July 3, 2009, weeks before Epstein was released from jail following his Florida conviction for charges including soliciting prostitution from a minor. The redaction of the Mona Lisa feels particularly misguided as the DOJ faces accusations of releasing identifying information about about 100 Epstein survivors in their latest release of documents related to the convicted child sex offender. One lawyer for a survivor claimed his client was named over 500 times in the files. According to the New York Times, 40 images contained unredacted nude photos and the faces of seven individuals. After the publication notified the DOJ, a spokesperson said it was in the process of making proper redactions. The most recent tranche of Epstein files has also revealed new connections between the disgraced financier and art world figures. David A. Ross, the former chair of the School of Visual Arts MFA Art Practice Department, resigned from his post following the release of his email exchanges with Epstein. Emails also showed that Jeff Koons attended a dinner at Epstein's home years after his conviction.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Jeffrey Epstein\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Eshun became the first Black leader of a major British arts institution when he took the helm of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. Asked what is most exciting to him about curating a biennial in New Mexico, Eshun told Hyperallergic that the region's art is “inseparable from a long history of imaginative reaching toward different possible futures.”“Here I’m thinking of the many visionary artists and alternative communities that have established themselves in the state across the decades. But I’m also thinking of how New Mexico holds within its landscape deep Indigenous histories and layered legacies of migration that continue to unsettle and complicate ideas of nation, identity, and belonging,” Eshun said.“Art is a means not of smoothing over those contradictions, but of widening our sense of what is possible within them,” Eshun continued. “Of imagining new forms of connection in a region that has always been open to different ways of seeing and being.”Mnuchin Gallery Calls ItNew York City's Mnuchin Gallery announced it will shutter this month following the death of its founder, investment banker Robert Mnuchin, at the end of last year. Despite its unpleasant associations (Robert's son Steven Mnuchin served as treasury secretary during Trump's first term), the gallery put on some incredible shows, including a truly mind-blowing Willem de Kooning survey in 2019. The gallery's swan song was an exhibition of ... Julian Schnabel plate paintings? Kind of an anticlimactic coda if you ask us.What Else Happened?Chelsea Bighorn at Anderson Ranch (photo by Evan Soroka, courtesy Walker Youngbird Foundation)Chelsea Bighorn is the recipient of the Walker Youngbird Foundation's 2026 Emerging Native Arts Grant. The Lakota, Dakota, and Shoshone-Paiute artist is pictured above working on one of her textile pieces, which often fuse elements from her Native American and Irish-American heritage.The Tulsa Artist Fellowship announced its 2026–2028 cohort, comprising Myiesha Gordon Beales, Derrick Estrada / Baseck, Amy Hoagland, Rebecca Nagle, Aaron Robertson, Amir Saadiq, Sabrina Saleha, Leonard Suryajaya, Dustin Tahmahkera, and Loren Waters. The Asian American Arts Alliance announced the 2026 recipients of its What Can We Do? grant, which provides $1,500 stipends to artists supporting New York's Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. Japanese sculptor Yuko Mohri won the $50,000 Calder Prize.Conny Maier is now represented by Société gallery in collaboration with Hauser & Wirth. Ulrike Al-Khamis will retire from her role as director and chief executive officer of the Aga Khan Museum after nine years.The Warhol Foundation is expanding its grant program to support visual arts projects at organizations with budgets under $200,000, citing “dramatic shifts in the national funding landscape” as one of its motivations.Put Your Money Where Your Foot IsMichelangelo, \"Study for a foot of the Libyan Sibyl (recto); Study of a leg with knee bent (verso)\" (photo by Max Touhey, courtesy Christie’s)What if you had a chance to acquire a piece of history? What if that piece of history was a study for one of the most famous artworks of all time — Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes? The catch: It's a five-by-five-inch drawing of a foot, and it'll cost you $27 million. Those were seemingly minor details for today's winning buyer at Christie's, who, undeterred by a 45-minute bidding war that catapulted the work's price to 20 times its low estimate, proudly took home the red chalk sketch and set a new record for the Italian Renaissance artist.

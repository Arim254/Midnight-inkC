    "body": "\n\tin Literature |   \tOctober 31st, 2025  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOf the many read­ings and adap­ta­tions of Edgar Allan Poe’s clas­sic moody-broody poem “The Raven,” none is more fun than The Simp­sons’, in which Lisa Simpson’s intro tran­si­tions into the read­ing voice of James Earl Jones and the slap­stick inter­jec­tions of Homer as Poe’s avatar and Bart as the tit­u­lar bird. Jones’ solo read­ing of the poem is not to be missed and exists in sev­er­al ver­sions on YouTube.\nBut Jones is not the only clas­si­cal­ly creepy actor to have mas­tered Poe’s dic­tion. Above, we have Christo­pher Walken, whose unset­tling weird­ness is always tinged with a cer­tain wry humor, per­haps an effect of his clas­si­cal New York accent.\nAccom­pa­ny­ing Walken’s read­ing are the stan­dard eerie wind sounds and the unusu­al addi­tion of some dis­tort­ed met­al gui­tar: per­haps an intru­sion, per­haps a unique dra­mat­ic effect. The visu­al com­po­nent, a mon­tage of expres­sive pen­cil draw­ings, also may or may not work for you.\n\n\n\t\n\nYou may wish to con­trast this pro­duc­tion with what may be the locus clas­si­cus for tele­vi­su­al inter­pre­ta­tions of “The Raven.” Of course I mean the ham­my Vin­cent Price read­ing (above), which lent so much aes­thet­i­cal­ly to The Simp­sons par­o­dy. One of my favorite lit­tle in-jokes in the lat­ter occurs dur­ing Bart and Lisa’s intro­duc­tion. Bart whines, “that looks like a school-book!” and Lisa replies, “don’t wor­ry, Bart. You won’t learn any­thing.”\nLisa’s rejoin­der is a sly ref­er­ence to Poe’s con­tempt for lit­er­a­ture meant to instruct or mor­al­ize, a ten­den­cy he called “the heresy of the Didac­tic.” Poe’s the­o­ry and prac­tice grew out of his desire that lit­er­a­ture have a “uni­ty of effect,” that it pro­duce an aes­thet­ic expe­ri­ence sole­ly through the author’s skill­ful use of lit­er­ary form. Poe may have antic­i­pat­ed and direct­ly influ­enced the French sym­bol­ists and oth­er aes­thetes like Oscar Wilde, but his assured place in high cul­ture has thank­ful­ly not got­ten in the way of pop appro­pri­a­tions of his more odd­ball tales, like “The Raven.” A peren­ni­al favorite read­ing of the poem is clas­sic hor­ror actor Christo­pher Lee’s (below), which may be the most straight­for­ward­ly creepy of them all.\n\n\n\t\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEdgar Allan Poe’s the Raven: Watch an Award-Win­ning Short Film That Mod­ern­izes Poe’s Clas­sic Tale\nÉdouard Manet Illus­trates Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven, in a French Edi­tion Trans­lat­ed by Stephane Mal­lar­mé (1875)\nHear Lou Reed’s The Raven, a Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe Fea­tur­ing David Bowie, Ornette Cole­man, Willem Dafoe & More\nThe Grate­ful Dead Pays Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” in a 1982 Con­cert: Hear “Raven Space”\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMichael Jack­son’s Thriller is the best-sell­ing album of all time, and not by a par­tic­u­lar­ly slim mar­gin. The most recent fig­ures have it reg­is­tered at 51.3 mil­lion copies, as against the 31.2 mil­lion notched by the run­ner up, AC/DC’s Back in Black. But it would sure­ly be a clos­er call with­out the title song’s cel­e­brat­ed music video, thir­teen John Lan­dis-direct­ed min­utes full of not just singing and danc­ing, but also clas­sic-style Hol­ly­wood mon­sters, some of them doing that singing and danc­ing them­selves. Hal­loween night is, of course, the best time to revis­it Michael Jack­son’s Thriller, as it’s offi­cial­ly titled. This year, why not chase it with the behind-the-scenes doc­u­men­tary below, Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller?\nYounger fans may not know that “Thriller” was­n’t even released as a sin­gle until Novem­ber of 1983: about a year after the album itself, which had already spun off six songs, includ­ing enor­mous hits like “Bil­lie Jean” and “Beat It.” In fact, Jack­son’s unprece­dent­ed vision for the album had been that every song could be a hit, with no filler in between.\nThe high­er-ups at Epic Records felt that its pop­u­lar­i­ty, how­ev­er sen­sa­tion­al to that point, had just about run its course. That made them unwill­ing, at first, to put out “Thriller” on its own, as did the song’s campy scary-movie lyrics, sound effects, and “rap” by none oth­er than Vin­cent Price, the embod­i­ment of old-Hol­ly­wood hor­ror. (This sort of thing was­n’t with­out prece­dent: with his sib­lings, Jack­son had cre­at­ed a sim­i­lar spooky atmos­phere in “This Place Hotel,” from 1980.)\n\n\n\t\n\nStill, at that point in his rise to the kind of fame no cul­tur­al fig­ure may ever know again, Jack­son under­stood much that the old guard did­n’t. He knew that “Thriller” could suc­ceed, not just as a song on the radio, but a mul­ti­me­dia cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­non. It would, of course, need a music video, but not one that mere­ly met the (still fair­ly lax) stan­dards of MTV. Impressed by the hor­ror, com­e­dy, and visu­al effects of John Lan­dis’ An Amer­i­can Were­wolf in Lon­don, Jack­son called up Lan­dis and asked him to direct what he’d been envi­sion­ing for “Thriller” at fea­ture-film pro­duc­tion val­ues. The $500,000 bud­get came from tele­vi­sion net­works like MTV and Show­time, offi­cial­ly for broad­cast­ing rights to Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller.\nThe doc­u­men­tary cap­tures var­i­ous aspects of the video’s cre­ation, from cast­ing to chore­og­ra­phy to shoot­ing to make­up, that last being an espe­cial­ly painstak­ing process over­seen by indus­try mas­ter Rick Bak­er. What­ev­er the rig­ors of the pro­duc­tion, Jack­son dis­plays undis­guised enjoy­ment of it all in this footage, per­haps fore­see­ing that it would cul­mi­nate in the kind of expres­sion that could come from no oth­er artist. Though an intense­ly col­lab­o­ra­tive effort, Michael Jack­son’s Thriller is true to its name in ulti­mate­ly being the prod­uct of a sin­gle, guid­ing per­for­ma­tive sen­si­bil­i­ty, some­how both uni­ver­sal­ly appeal­ing and high­ly idio­syn­crat­ic at the same time. Jack­son’s insis­tence on call­ing his music videos “short films” may have been regard­ed as a typ­i­cal eccen­tric­i­ty, but nev­er was the label more appro­pri­ate than when he brought back the old-school mon­ster movie one last, funky time.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” Video Changed Pop Cul­ture For­ev­er: Revis­it the 13-Minute Short Film Direct­ed by John Lan­dis\nHear “Starlight,” Michael Jackson’s Ear­ly Demo of “Thriller”: A Ver­sion Before the Lyrics Were Rad­i­cal­ly Changed\nWhen Mar­tin Scors­ese Direct­ed Michael Jack­son in the 18-Minute “Bad” Music Video & Paid Cin­e­mat­ic Trib­ute to West Side Sto­ry (1986)\nHow Michael Jack­son Wrote a Song: A Close Look at How the King of Pop Craft­ed “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough”\nJohn Lan­dis Decon­structs Trail­ers of Great 20th Cen­tu­ry Films: Cit­i­zen Kane, Sun­set Boule­vard, 2001 & More\nWhere Zom­bies Come From: A Video Essay on the Ori­gin of the Hor­ri­fy­ing, Satir­i­cal Mon­sters\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThroughout her practice, Renée Condo draws on the philosophical tenets of her Mi’gmaq ancestry. The Montreal-based artist works with wooden beads that she sands, paints in bold acrylic, and nests into energetic compositions depicting juicy fruits, raindrops, and brilliant, golden suns.\nCondo is interested in mntu, or spirit, and what she refers to as heart knowledge, acts that emerge from empathy and love. Through sculptural pieces that emphasize interconnection and flow, the artist draws on Indigenous creation stories and myths, considering her beadwork a reimagining of various traditions.\n“Giju'” (2024), wood beads, acrylic paint, epoxy on wood panel, 72 × 60 inches\nCondo often engages the relationship between the component and composition, emphasizing the ways in which a singular piece would appear abstract without a broader context. “The bead as fundamental entity, as infinite potentiality, can appear as divided, as unit, as part,” she says, “but is at once whole and all-encompassing, holding secrets of the world and to the nature of reality.”\nThis fall, Condo will have work on view at GAVLAK, where she’s represented.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJacky Connolly, “The Mineral Kingdom (Dark Green)” (2025),\nvideo installation, color, sound, light, 37 min, looped, dimensions variable (courtesy the artist, image courtesy Taipei Fine Arts Museum)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe 14th edition of the Taipei Biennial, Whispers on the Horizon, opens on November 1 at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM). Curated by Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath (Directors of Hamburger Bahnhof – Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart, Berlin), the exhibition brings together about 150 works by 72 artists from 37 cities, featuring 34 new commissions and site-specific installations spanning painting, sculpture, film, photography, and performance. \nWhispers on the Horizon explores yearning as an enduring human drive that reaches beyond the possible, speaking of the future through quiet insistence rather than proclamation. Its conceptual framework centers on three modest yet charged objects drawn from Taiwan’s literary and cinematic works — absent from the galleries but shaping the exhibition’s emotional and temporal arc. The puppet from Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s The Puppetmaster (1993) embodies perseverance through eras of occupation and renewal; the diary in Chen Yingzhen’s My Kid Brother Kangxiong (1960) captures a generation’s struggle between conviction and disillusion; and the bicycle in Wu Ming-Yi’s The Stolen Bicycle (2015) evokes loss, inheritance, and belonging. Together, they form an invisible architecture for the Biennial: the puppet as continuity, the diary as interiority, and the bicycle as pursuit — three intertwined expressions of yearning.\nThe Biennial weaves contemporary works with around 30 pieces from the Taipei Fine Arts Museum’s collection. In dialogue with the new art, these collection pieces act not as static artifacts but as living agents of yearning, bridging past and present to foster intergenerational conversation. Suspended textile partitions replace solid walls in an echo of the exhibitions themes, creating permeable thresholds and open sightlines that foster a rhythm of visibility and connection. \n“We want to create a Biennial that could only exist here — one that listens to the histories, languages, and contradictions that make Taipei what it is. Our dialogue with TFAM’s collection was not an act of nostalgia but of grounding: an insistence that the local, when deeply engaged, becomes a lens for the world. In Whispers on the Horizon, yearning is that bridge — it begins in the intimacy of memory and extends into a shared horizon where the local turns universal,” said Bardaouil and Fellrath.\nExhibition Highlights\nThe ground floor features works devoted to craft, memory, and care as acts of survival, including Ciou Zih-Yan’s “Fake Airfield” (2025), which reconstructs a decoy airstrip from the Japanese colonial era. Also on view are “Out in the Fields” (1934) by Chen Chin, whose paintings of elegant women came to symbolize a Taiwan in search of its identity, and Afra Al Dhaheri’s “Weighted PAUSE” (2025), in which meditative looped rope arrangements invite viewers to contemplate slowness as a form of resistance.\nThe basement level centers on the body as both witness and vessel of transformation. Through rhythmically crushed stone and glass vessels, Ivana Bašić shapes the act of breathing into sculpture in “Passion of Pneumatics” (2020–24) and “Metanoia” (2025). A 1956 photograph by the late Syu Ching-Pwo, “Confidence,” captures two men leaning close in conversation, separating and connecting at once, while Jacky Connolly’s “The Mineral Kingdom (Dark Green)” (2025) uses dreamlike imagery to merge memory with virtual terrain, turning personal grief into digital landscapes.\nOn the upper level, the works trace an artistic lineage driven by the desire to perceive, interpret, and connect — collectively reimagining the world through the lens of yearning. Liu Kuo-Sung breaks from traditional ink painting to develop new abstract forms in “Floating Mountain” (1971) as Eva Jospin constructs a mirrored forest in “Ici” (2025), inspired by the classical Huang Gongwang painting “Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains” (1348–50). With “Skeleton” (2025), P. Staff turns the gallery into an exploration of control and resistance, layering infrared imagery and poetic narration to examine how bodies are regulated and liberated.\nLi-chen Loh, Director of the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, remarks: “Since its inception, the Taipei Biennial has embraced diversity of voices. This edition reflects on the ties between local experience and global context, inviting visitors to reconsider their place in an interconnected world.”\nFor more information, visit taipeibiennial.org/2025 or follow TFAM’s Facebook and Instagram.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\nNight at the Biennial. Get the kids and run. (all images by Damien Davis)\nPrologue: Doors\nThe champagne flutes rattled as The Museum’s grand atrium doors groaned shut. At first, no one noticed. The art world rarely notices when the walls start closing in. The collectors were too busy air-kissing. The curators were trading gossip about Venice. The artists were adjusting their name tags to catch the light just right for photographs.\nThen the sound came. A metallic clang echoed through the atrium, reverberating off marble floors and neon sculptures. Security gates descended like guillotines. The crowd laughed nervously.\n“Probably a glitch,” said The Museum Director, adjusting his lapel pin. He raised his glass. “Enjoy yourselves. You are perfectly safe.”\nHis smile stretched too wide, like vinyl warped under a heat lamp.\nHe was the first to go.\nAct I: The First Cut\nThe opening speeches had barely ended when the first scream tore through the galleries.\nThe MFA Darling did not even get a chance to finish his artist’s statement. One moment, he was explaining his practice — something about recontextualizing laundry detergent pods through a queer phenomenology of surfaces — and the next, he was gone. Pulled into the shadows behind his own installation.\nOnly a smudge of wall text remained, peeling at the edges.\nPeople gasped. Collectors whispered. Someone muttered that this had to be a performance. A few Instagram influencers posed beside the bloodstain, hashtags already prepared: #biennial #soedgy #performanceart.\n“This is not a drill,” said The Nerd, clutching a battered biennial catalogue from 2013. Her glasses were fogged with panic. “I have seen this before. I wrote about this. The architecture is cursed. The walls are feeding.”\nNo one listened. They never do.\nBefore the tension eased, The Black Artist was gone as well. His monumental work on surveillance and joy had been placed under the atrium skylight, surrounded by collectors repeating the word “urgent.” The crowd clapped too long, chanted too loudly, and swallowed him whole. When the applause stopped, only an empty crate stamped RETURN TO STORAGE remained.\n“Representation,” someone whispered, “is exhausting.”\n“Representation,” someone whispered, “is exhausting.”\nAct II: The Killers Unmasked\nThe museum shifted around them. Corridors looped back into themselves. Wall labels rearranged their text in real time. Paintings bled into sculptures. Video installations flickered with scenes from previous fairs.\nThen he appeared.\nThe Killer.\nHe wore a bespoke suit, shoes so polished they reflected the exit signs, but his face was hidden behind a stainless steel mask. On its mirrored surface shimmered the logos of every mega-gallery in Chelsea. His voice was soft, soothing, almost parental.\n“Representation is forever.”\nIn one hand, he carried a contract. In the other, he held an invitation to a collector’s dinner. The crowd shivered as he advanced.\nThe Jock, drunk from the opening bar, staggered forward. “I have Basel next month,” he boasted. “Venice after that. You think you can kill me? I am the future.”\nThe Killer tilted his head. The Jock turned, and his own mirrored installation collapsed on top of him. Glass sliced through his limited-edition sneakers. He died in a spray of glitter and fake fog, an Instagram-ready corpse.\n“Guess not the future,” whispered a curator.\nThe Collector moved silently, a phantom in couture. One moment, she was praising an artist, calling their work brilliant. The next thing, she was gone, dragging their piece into the secondary market. Auction hammers fell like axes, draining value from careers. She left no blood, only resale records and ruin.\nThe Doomed Authority Figure fared no better. The Director who had dismissed the danger was cornered in the boardroom. Protesters smashed through skylights, brandishing banners: No War Profiteers on Boards. Abolish Dirty Money.\nHe tried to insist he was innocent, but his resignation letter was written in blood.\nMeanwhile, the Nerd scribbled furiously in her notebook. “It is the system itself,” she cried. “The biennial is alive. The market is the monster. The walls—”\nBut her voice was swallowed by the hum of an ambient sound installation. No one heard her. Not until it was too late.\nAct III: The Body Count Rises\nBy two in the morning, the atrium had thinned. Shadows pooled in the corners. A video piece of an endlessly looping sunset suddenly showed the Jock’s corpse, projected at monumental scale.\nComic Relief tried to keep spirits up. They were a scrappy collective who had once turned a supply closet into a gallery. They told jokes about landlords and foundations that paid for exposure.\n“We will start our own fair in Bushwick,” they said. “We will do it better. No hierarchies. No vampires.”\nThe walls answered by collapsing on them. They were crushed beneath unpaid invoices, grant rejections, and fire code violations. The rustle of shredded checks replaced their laughter.\nThe Virgin wandered quietly. She had no collectors, no market frenzy, no scandals. She kept her head down, her practice modest. She had never touched NFTs, nor had she courted a blue-chip dealer. She clutched a sketchbook like a rosary.\nBecause she refused to play, the killers barely noticed her. She slipped through the carnage invisible, untouched.\nThe Nerd fought to survive. She waved her catalogue like a weapon, citing footnotes and quoting Hal Foster. “We have to resist the spectacle,” she shouted.\nThe walls swallowed her whole. All that remained was her tote bag: ART IS RESISTANCE.\n“We have to resist the spectacle,” she shouted.\nThe Final Girl watched it all in silence. She was not glamorous. She was not loud. She had spent decades overlooked, dismissed as solid but unspectacular, talented but unlikable.\nBut she carried a tote of her own: duct tape, spackle, leftover grant funds, a residency meal card. The tools of survival.\nWhen the Mega-Gallery Killer lunged, she patched the wall shut. When the Collector tried to flip her work, she quietly withdrew it from auction. When the institution roared, she ducked into her practice, biding her time.\nShe did not fight for glory. She fought to endure.\nAct IV: Dawn\nBy dawn, only she and the Virgin remained. The Virgin whispered, “How did you survive?”\nThe Final Girl shrugged. “I never stopped working.”\nThe atrium doors creaked open, sunlight spilling through. The Final Girl stepped into the cold morning, her clothes flecked with acrylic dust. Behind her, the museum groaned, collapsed, and began rebuilding itself for next year’s cycle.\nShe did not look back.\nEpilogue\nWeeks later, the art press published their reviews:\n\n“The biennial was a triumph of resilience.”\n“The market shows no signs of slowing.”\n“The Director’s replacement promises reform.”\n\nNo one mentioned the blood. No one mentioned the bodies.\nOnly the Final Girl remembered. She carried the memory back into her studio, knowing the cycle would start again. Because in the art world, survival is not victory. Survival is just another practice.\n\t",

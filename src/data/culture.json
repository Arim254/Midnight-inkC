    "body": "\n\n\t\nBy marrying the realistic with the fantastical and uncanny, Stephanie Temma Hier conjures tension: there’s a calf-hair necktie that morphs into a table fan, popcorn surrounding pink ballet shoes, and a rapt snake framed by orange igneous rocks.\nThe Brooklyn-based artist is formally trained as a painter and self-taught as a ceramicist, and she fuses the two modes of working into a complementary practice. Hier begins by sculpting a wide range of forms, and after several rounds of firing with both handmade and commercially available glazes, she adds a painting. The pairings arise intuitively, sometimes through free association, trial and error, or by homing in on a color.\n\nEarlier works include a decadent, three-tiered cake piped not with pillowy buttercream but instead trimmed with olives, sausages, and thin slices of prosciutto. There’s also a thick head of green cabbage that reveals a trio of ravenous chicks roosted in its core. While the artist’s depictions in both clay and paint are lifelike, the juxtapositions push the works firmly into the realm of the surreal and ambiguous.\nMany of the works shown here will debut this month at Anton Kern Gallery for Hier’s solo exhibition, Swan Song. Nodding to the ancient Greek belief that the otherwise “mute” birds sing just before their deaths, the exhibition takes transformation as its starting point. Elements of Dutch still lifes appear, too, as flowers bloom and pastries and coffee are consumed across a picnic-esque surface.\nHier created the Swan Song pieces simultaneously, allowing motifs and themes to recur throughout. The titular bird, for example, appears in several works, from the feathered chair with thick, stocky webbed legs to the intimate portrait encircled by an array of speckled shoes. Together, the mixed-media pieces create a sort of domestic tableau that unsettles in its familiarity, presenting a fantastic world in which the only inevitabilities are the unexpected and change.\nSwan Song is on view from January 14 to February 21 in New York. Find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The group is perhaps best known for hosting the World Summit on Arts and Culture, whose 10th edition last year gathered artists and industry leaders to discuss topics including artificial intelligence, Indigenous knowledge, and fair working conditions.Members of IFACCA include representatives for more than 70 countries, including the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the US arts funding agency that Trump has sought to dismantle. As of today, the NEA is still listed as a member on IFACCA's website. Hyperallergic has contacted IFACCA's executive director, Magdalena Moreno Mujica, as well as the NEA for comment. Established in 1959 in response to mass cultural heritage loss during World War II, the ICCROM focuses on disaster risk management and conservation of historic sites, monuments, museum collections, and other forms of artistic patrimony. Its work includes training experts, leading research, and encouraging international bodies to cooperate on preservation. In September 2024, ICCROM partnered with the US State Department to help safeguard Ukrainian cultural sites under threat from Russian attacks. In a statement shared with Hyperallergic, ICCROM said the US had been a member since 1971 and that its withdrawal “will have a direct impact on ICCROM’s core capacities, with consequences for the Organization’s ability to deliver on its mandate.”Hermann Parzinger, executive president of the pan-European cultural heritage group Europa Nostra, also decried the move, particularly in light of Trump's “deplorable withdrawal” from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) last July.“This sweeping retreat from multilateral cooperation of a major global player seems to signal a troubling misunderstanding of the essential role that culture and heritage play in fostering peace, mutual respect, resilience, innovation, and shared prosperity across the globe,” Parzinger said.Around half of the entities in the White House memo are connected to the United Nations, and several address clean energy and the environment, including the high-profile UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the basis of international efforts to address global warming. But the list also includes a multilateral counterterrorism body, a UN office dedicated to preventing violence against children, and a coalition working to protect internet freedom, suggesting a broad criteria and unclear priorities.Advocates and officials warned that Trump's mass exodus from these efforts could have disastrous consequences for human rights worldwide. The president's distancing from global cooperation on urgent issues such as the climate emergency comes just a week after the US attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, and in the wake of Trump's renewed threats to seize Greenland from Denmark.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            South Africa has scrapped a performance mourning victims of Israel's genocide in Gaza that was selected for the country's 2026 Venice Biennale pavilion. In a statement to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for the nation's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture said the pavilion “should not be used to amplify similarly divisive global disputes that do not center South Africa’s own story,” adding: “We need to use our platforms to sell our country to the world.”Artist Gabrielle Goliath and curator Ingrid Masondo's proposal for the South African presentation, titled Elegy after Goliath's decade-long vocal performance series, had been chosen for the Biennale by an independent committee in December. According to reporting by the South African publication Daily Maverick, the decision to reject the artwork originated from the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture's minister, Gayton McKenzie, the founder of the right-wing Patriotic Alliance party. Goliath's pavilion performance would have addressed the \"unfolding crisis of displacement and death in Gaza,\" according to a representative of her studio, reached via email by Hyperallergic. The performance was also expected to address the Israeli military's killing of the Palestinian poet Hiba Abu Nada, the femicide in South Africa, and the Herero and Nama genocide perpetuated by Germans in Namibia in the early 20th century. However, according to the Daily Maverick, McKenzie took issue with the proposal's content regarding Israel and Gaza, writing in an internal letter in December that the subject was \"highly divisive in nature and relates to an ongoing international conflict that is widely polarising.” He then reportedly threatened to withdraw South Africa from the international art event if the work was not removed, a move decried by the country's pavilion selection committee as unconstitutional. In a January 8 open letter, the members of the appointed Biennale selection committee defended their decision to accept Elegy.\"We affirm our continued and unequivocal support for the artist, the curator, and their project in the face of political pressure and attempts to silence free expression and compromise artistic integrity,\" reads the statement, signed by Greer Valley, Molemo Moiloa, Nomusa Makhubu, Sean O’Toole, and Tumelo Mosaka.“We further reject all forms of censorship and intimidation that seek to curtail critical artistic practice or undermine the autonomy of cultural production,” the letter continues. The group characterized Elegy as concerning “intimacy, care, and listening, [and] creating space for reflection on loss and remembrance.\"Organizers of the country's pavilion were reportedly notified of McKenzie's request to remove the performance series on January 2. The South African government had appointed the organization Art Periodic to lead the fundraising and production of the pavilion; however, the nonprofit said in a statement that it no longer \"holds a mandate to proceed with the project.\" Art Periodic had appointed the selection committee that chose Elegy.South Africa Friends of Israel posted a video on Facebook that apparently shows McKenzie rejecting that a genocide was unfolding in Gaza, a claim that contradicts the official characterization of the United Nations and several human rights groups. He also vowed to \"stop the ICJ case,\" likely referring to South Africa's genocide charge against Israel in the United Nations' International Court of Justice, if he were to become president. (Hyperallergic has not independently verified the video clip.)In an email statement sent to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture rejected the allegations of censorship and stated that McKenzie wished for the pavilion not to become a “proxy arena for geopolitical conflicts.\"\"His concern relates solely to the fact that South Africa is currently the subject of highly contested and politically charged narratives internationally, including being falsely labelled a 'genocidal state,'\" the spokesperson said, possibly referring to comparisons between Israel and Apartheid-era South Africa.The spokesperson also claimed that a \"foreign country was funding or partly funding this exhibition,\" but did not immediately clarify which nation they were referring to. Goliath and Masondo have appealed the decision to the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation, the artist's studio told Hyperallergic in an email.According to the Maverick, communications from McKenzie suggested he would favor works for the pavilion that portray South Africa more positively. The United States Department of State issued a similar nationalistic requirement for its pavilion proposal guidelines last year. “I have said it many times: my work is not about violence, but rather foregrounds practices of mourning, survival, and repair, within and despite this normative disregard,\" Goliath told the Maverick. \"At a moment in which sustaining hope is a political imperative, I think it is all the more crucial to emphasise my work as life-work rather than death-work, and as rooted in a decolonial black feminist project of care and radical love.”The spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture said the nation will still participate in the upcoming Venice Biennale, but that the department had retained control of “administration and curation.”Hyperallergic has contacted Art Periodic and the Venice Biennale for comment. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        South Africa\n                      \n                      \n                        Venice Biennale\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Although it is LA’s longest-running art fair, the show is somewhat of an outcast, snubbed as pedestrian, too commercial, and out of touch with the cutting edge of the global art world. But at the rear of the cavernous exhibition hall, a pair of projects organized by curator Marisa Caichiolo gives visitors a sense of the fair’s cultural and political relevance.Caichiolo organized the first Latin American Pavilion at the fair, a modest group of three booths: Artier Gallery from Palm Springs, Verse Gallery from Ft. Lauderdale, and Building Bridges Art Exchange, the LA-based nonprofit she founded in 2005. The display also features selections from the Pangue International Video Art Festival, with video works by 20 contemporary artists from Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Chile, and elsewhere. “They’re artists that people here may not know, but they're so powerful in their own communities,” Caichiolo told Hyperallergic.Artier Gallery's booth at the 2026 LA Art Show with works by Natasha Grey, Carlos Luna James, and Dario OrtizAlthough the fair is international in scope, with a strong focus on Asia, there has historically been less representation from Latin America, something Caichiolo hopes to begin to correct with this first pavilion and expand upon in subsequent editions.The entrance of Artier Gallery’s booth is framed by Mexico City-based artist Natasha Grey’s linen pastel and charcoal drawing “Mutable Sun” (2025), depicting a jaguar and Ixchel, the Maya goddess of the moon. On either side are vibrant, futuristic masks by Carlos Luna James, who lives in Ciudad Juárez, on the United States-Mexico border. Colombian artist Dario Ortiz updates traditional stories in his meticulously painted canvases, portraying mythological figures as contemporary border crossers making their way along the riverbank.Works by Johnny Lopez near selections from the Pangue International Video Art FestivalVerse Gallery has brought artists primarily from Colombia and Ecuador, including Johnny Lopez, whose slick resin sculptures mix Indigenous and European motifs with elements of pop culture and street art. Ecuadorian artist Maca Viva slyly challenges male power icons with her uncanny paintings of furry crowns. Colombian artist Alejandro Sanchez’s sculptures are composed of miniature storage containers, sparking a playful dialogue with Minimalist aesthetics.Works by Maquiamelo (left) and Maca Viva (right) at the booth of Verse Gallery Caichiolo also curated the fair’s non-commercial section, DIVERSEartLA, which is centered around the theme of biennials this year. She tapped several curators to select work from the Casablanca Biennial (Morocco), Gwangju Biennial (Korea), and the World Textile Art Biennial (Miami), among other recent exhibitions. The highlight is a mini-retrospective of biennials that have featured the work of artist Marcos Ramírez, who goes by ERRE, curated by Alma Ruiz. A cross-border artist who operates between Tijuana and San Diego, ERRE has long engaged with issues of Latine identity, immigration, and nationalism, with provocative works like his monumental \"Toy-an Horse\" (1997), placed at the dividing line between Mexico and the US. Artist Marcos Ramirez (ERRE) with his work \"Democracy\" (2000)His major installation “187 Pairs of Hands” (1996–97), represented here by a small section, consists of 187 photographs of people performing various examples of manual labor, accompanied by information about each subject. The work was a response to California Proposition 187, an anti-immigration ballot initiative that excluded undocumented immigrants from receiving public services such as education and healthcare. “They tried to suppress us, surround us, and cage the workers, but everybody's still working, right now,” ERRE said, noting the connection between the bill and current ICE raids. “How can you stop a waterfall? You can't. You need to freeze the whole river.” The artist’s works feel especially urgent in the wake of the brutal killing of Renee Nicole Macklin Good by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis just days ago.In addition to these focused presentations, this year’s fair features an international roster of over 90 exhibitors, including Epicentrum Gallery from Poland and Paris with prints by Picasso, Chagall, and Dali; London’s Rebecca Hossack Gallery with collaged paintings by Spanish artist Mersuka Dopazo; and motorcycle-inspired paintings by Clash bassist Paul Simonon at John Martin Gallery’s booth. There’s something for everyone, so if you've heard the LA Art Show is unhip in comparison to next month’s fairs, it might just be worth a trip over this weekend to see for yourself.

    "body": "\n\tAs part of its upcoming spring program, the Barbican in London will stage a major commission by artist Delcy Morelos, her first in the United Kingdom.\n\n\tFor the commission, on view May 15 to July 31, Morelos will construct her most ambitious sculptural installation to date. Measuring around 78 feet in circumference, the new work, to be sited in the Barbican’s outdoor sculpture courtyard, will take the form of an oval-shaped pavilion made of soil, clay, spices, and plant materials.\n\n\tMorelos’s commission is the third by the Barbican to be staged in its public areas and the first to be done in its Sculpture Court. “Our public realm commissions invite artists to respond to the Barbican’s iconic brutalist architecture, whilst inviting our audiences to experience new work across our spaces. Morelos’ installation brings back our Sculpture Court to its original purpose in the most incredible way,” Devyani Saltzman, the Barbican’s director for arts and participation, said in a statement.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe London-based Bukhman Foundation, founded by Anastasia Bukhman, a new addition to 2025 edition of ARTnews’s Top 200 Collectors list, is the commission’s lead philanthropic supporter.\n\n\tIn a statement, Bukhman said that Morelos’s work, “rooted in earth, materiality, and ancestral wisdom, finds a perfect home in this exceptional space. Through her immersive vision, she invites us not only to see, but to feel and inhabit the very substance of the world. We believe that access to art that is bold, ambitious, and profound is essential to widening creative opportunity, nurturing the next generation of artists and cultural leaders, and inspiring the wider public.”\n\n\tOver the past few years, Morelos has become known for creating such installations, as she did for the 2022 Venice Biennale and for a solo installation at the Dia Art Foundation in New York in 2023. For the latter exhibition, Morelos was awarded the inaugural ARTnews Award in the category Established Artist of Year.\n\n\tOne of the works in her Dia exhibition was titled El abrazo (The embrace). For that installation, viewers would enter a V-shaped alcove and seemingly be given a hug by the earth. Viewers were encouraged to touch the earth that was embedded in it.\n\t\n\n\t“This is made of earth—it’s so fragile. It has size and magnitude, but it also has a humility in the materials and a fragility,” she told ARTnews of that exhibition. “There’s something very feminine, very delicate. The embrace happens literally when you get closer and feel the earth surround you.”\n",

Digital image: Wikimedia Commons.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\tHolland’s Mauritshuis museum in The Hague announced on Thursday that the best-known work in its collection, Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, will travel to Japan this fall. The news was reported by the Japan Times.\n\n\tThe 17th-century masterpiece will be on temporary loan to the Nakanoshima Museum of Art in Osaka while the Dutch museum is closed for renovations in August and September. The painting was last loaned to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam for its 2023 Vermeer retrospective.\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“Girl with a Pearl Earring is one of the most famous paintings in the world,” the museum said, “and is a key reason for many people to visit the Mauritshuis. It is therefore loaned to other institutions only in highly exceptional circumstances.”\n\t\n\n\tOne of only 34 known paintings by Vermeer, Girl with a Pearl Earring depicts a young woman, wearing exotic headgear and the titular bauble, looking back at the viewer with her lips parted. It received global attention after inspiring a best-selling novel of the same name, which was adapted into a 2003 film starring Scarlett Johansson.\n\n\tThe Osaka presentation will be underwritten by Japanese media conglomerate The Asahi Shimbun Company, which will also serve as a project partner to the Mauritshuis for the next four years. The museum will use The Asahi Shimbun Company’s support to fund alterations to its properties, including a new education center slated to open in 2028.\n\n\t“For the Mauritshuis, the Girl’s trip to Japan is an unique opportunity for us to share her with the Japanese public, perhaps for the very last time,” said Martine Gosselink, general director of the Mauritshuis, in a statement.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNewswire\n\t\n\n",

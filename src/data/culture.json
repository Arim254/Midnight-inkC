    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe arboreal designs featured in TASCHEN’s new book aren’t your dad’s Home Depot box variety. Uniquely stunning, all 62 structures in Modern Tree Houses respond to the surrounding environment, whether a tiny, winterized pod for escaping the snow or a split-level playground complete with climbing ropes and nests. Built by architects and amateurs alike, each dwelling is varied in material, layout, purpose, and aesthetic, although all thrive because of their proximity to nature’s beauty.\n“Modern tree houses are proof that happiness doesn’t have to be built big—just built right,” author Florian Siebeck says, presenting an array of spaces from luxurious escapes to children’s hideouts.

Curated by Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath (Directors of Hamburger Bahnhof – Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart, Berlin), the exhibition brings together about 150 works by 72 artists from 37 cities, featuring 34 new commissions and site-specific installations spanning painting, sculpture, film, photography, and performance. \nWhispers on the Horizon explores yearning as an enduring human drive that reaches beyond the possible, speaking of the future through quiet insistence rather than proclamation. Its conceptual framework centers on three modest yet charged objects drawn from Taiwan’s literary and cinematic works — absent from the galleries but shaping the exhibition’s emotional and temporal arc. The puppet from Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s The Puppetmaster (1993) embodies perseverance through eras of occupation and renewal; the diary in Chen Yingzhen’s My Kid Brother Kangxiong (1960) captures a generation’s struggle between conviction and disillusion; and the bicycle in Wu Ming-Yi’s The Stolen Bicycle (2015) evokes loss, inheritance, and belonging. Together, they form an invisible architecture for the Biennial: the puppet as continuity, the diary as interiority, and the bicycle as pursuit — three intertwined expressions of yearning.\nThe Biennial weaves contemporary works with around 30 pieces from the Taipei Fine Arts Museum’s collection. In dialogue with the new art, these collection pieces act not as static artifacts but as living agents of yearning, bridging past and present to foster intergenerational conversation. Suspended textile partitions replace solid walls in an echo of the exhibitions themes, creating permeable thresholds and open sightlines that foster a rhythm of visibility and connection. \n“We want to create a Biennial that could only exist here — one that listens to the histories, languages, and contradictions that make Taipei what it is. Our dialogue with TFAM’s collection was not an act of nostalgia but of grounding: an insistence that the local, when deeply engaged, becomes a lens for the world. In Whispers on the Horizon, yearning is that bridge — it begins in the intimacy of memory and extends into a shared horizon where the local turns universal,” said Bardaouil and Fellrath.\nExhibition Highlights\nThe ground floor features works devoted to craft, memory, and care as acts of survival, including Ciou Zih-Yan’s “Fake Airfield” (2025), which reconstructs a decoy airstrip from the Japanese colonial era. Also on view are “Out in the Fields” (1934) by Chen Chin, whose paintings of elegant women came to symbolize a Taiwan in search of its identity, and Afra Al Dhaheri’s “Weighted PAUSE” (2025), in which meditative looped rope arrangements invite viewers to contemplate slowness as a form of resistance.\nThe basement level centers on the body as both witness and vessel of transformation. Through rhythmically crushed stone and glass vessels, Ivana Bašić shapes the act of breathing into sculpture in “Passion of Pneumatics” (2020–24) and “Metanoia” (2025). A 1956 photograph by the late Syu Ching-Pwo, “Confidence,” captures two men leaning close in conversation, separating and connecting at once, while Jacky Connolly’s “The Mineral Kingdom (Dark Green)” (2025) uses dreamlike imagery to merge memory with virtual terrain, turning personal grief into digital landscapes.\nOn the upper level, the works trace an artistic lineage driven by the desire to perceive, interpret, and connect — collectively reimagining the world through the lens of yearning. Liu Kuo-Sung breaks from traditional ink painting to develop new abstract forms in “Floating Mountain” (1971) as Eva Jospin constructs a mirrored forest in “Ici” (2025), inspired by the classical Huang Gongwang painting “Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains” (1348–50). With “Skeleton” (2025), P. Staff turns the gallery into an exploration of control and resistance, layering infrared imagery and poetic narration to examine how bodies are regulated and liberated.\nLi-chen Loh, Director of the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, remarks: “Since its inception, the Taipei Biennial has embraced diversity of voices. This edition reflects on the ties between local experience and global context, inviting visitors to reconsider their place in an interconnected world.”\nFor more information, visit taipeibiennial.org/2025 or follow TFAM’s Facebook and Instagram.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

The exhibition is curated by Nicolas Bourriaud, who coined the term “relational aesthetics.”\nThe artists cited a collaboration between MAXXI and Eni, an Italian company, on a series of artworks on view at the company’s complex in Rome. The energy firm has reportedly received an Israeli offshore oil exploration license, which the artist’s letter claims allows it to drill in the waters off the coast of Gaza.\nMAXXI has not responded to Hyperallergic’s inquiries, and it is unclear whether the artists’ works have been removed from the show. Hyperallergic has attempted to contact all of the artist signatories as well as the exhibition’s curator for comment.\nLast month, protesters targeted Eni’s oil-exporting vessels in Taranto, Italy, which were believed to be intended for Israel. The letter also names and accuses MAXXI of having “a history of partnerships” with Leonardo S.p.A., a European arms manufacturer; its foundation for culture Med-Or; the geospacial information company e-GEOS; and satellite company Telespazio. The letter did not specify what collaborations the museum had undertaken with the companies.\nThe artists said collaborations with the named entities are part of a “broader and persistent pattern of institutional choices which reveal the museum’s role in legitimizing zionist propaganda and narratives that enable the systematic erasure of Palestinian culture, history, and life.”\nIn a separate letter published in the same Nero article, the Palestine activist groups Galassia Antisionista, Vogliamo Tutt’Altro, BDS Roma, Il Campo Innocente, and ANGA stated their intent to “expose the complicity of art institutions with the military industrial complex.” \nThe groups have been boycotting cultural institutions, including MAXXI, in solidarity with Palestine, the letter said.\n“This decision underscores our conviction that, as artists, we must take responsibility for the injustices our work might otherwise be used to justify, legitimize, and art-wash,” the artists wrote.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVincent van Gogh, “Olive Picking” (1889) (public domain via Wikimedia Commons)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA lawsuit claims that the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a Greek foundation should not have acquired a Vincent van Gogh oil painting stolen by the Nazis, and should return the work to the relatives of its rightful owners.\nThe heirs to a German-Jewish family say they were forced to abandon van Gogh’s 1889 painting “Olive Picking” in Munich when they fled Nazi rule and are suing The Met and the Basil and Elise Goulandris Foundation for allegedly purchasing the work without fully researching its provenance.\n“In the decades since the end of World War II, this Nazi-looted painting has been repeatedly and secretly trafficked, purchased and sold in and through New York,” reads the complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court by Judith Anne Silver, administrator of the Estate of Hedwig E. Stern. The heirs are seeking the restitution of the painting or its equivalence in value as well as damages over $75,000.\nIn a statement to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for The Met said the institution believes the work entered its collection and was sold “legally and well within all guidelines and policies,” but welcomed any new information about the piece.\nThe painting’s controversial provenance remains in dispute.  \nThe Dutch Post-Impressionist artist created the work, which depicts three women using a ladder to pluck olives from a grove, a year before he died. Fritz and Hedwig Stern purchased the painting in 1935, but the Nazi government declared it “German cultural property” and prevented them from bringing it with them when they fled with their six children to California the following year, the suit said.\nInstead, the Nazis appointed a “trustee” to sell the painting in 1938, put the funds in a blocked account, and later confiscated the money, the suit claimed. The painting made its way to Tübingen, then part of the French Zone, and eventually New York by way of dealer Justin Thannhauser, who had played a role in the sale of the work in Berlin and sought the approval of the French government to have it sent to him. (Although Thannhauser, who was Jewish, was also forced to flee Germany, he is “now widely known to have trafficked in art that was looted from or sold under duress by Jewish families,” the suit states.)\nAround 1948, Thannhauser sold the work to the wealthy businessman Vincent Astor, allegedly without disclosing its connection to the Sterns. \nBy 1955, Astor’s wife, the philanthropist Brooke Astor, consigned the painting to the Knoedler Gallery, which sold it to the Met the following year for $125,000. Museum curator Theodore Rousseau, Jr. approved the purchase but failed to realize that the Nazis had taken the painting despite serving as an officer on the Art Looting Investigation Unit in the Office of Strategic Services during the war, the suit claims.\n“Rousseau and the Met knew or should have known that the painting had probably been looted by Nazis,” the suit said.\nIn 1972, the museum sold the work via Marlborough Gallery to the Greek shipping magnate Basil Goulandris and his wife Elise. It is currently on display in an Athens museum run by the Greek couple’s foundation, which does not mention the Stern family’s role in its ownership. The lawsuit further accuses the Gouladris family and its entities of deliberately concealing the painting’s provenance via a series of transfers.\nHyperallergic has contacted the Goulandris Foundation for comment.\nThe lawsuit questions the Met’s reasons for deaccessioning the work, alleging that “it was concerned that another institution would report the painting as looted.”\nAs for The Met, museum officials say that the painting met the museum’s “strict criteria for deaccessioning” since it was determined to be of lesser importance than other van Gogh works in its collection. They added that the museum published the artwork’s known ownership history in a 1967 catalogue of French paintings in the collection.\n“At no time during The Met’s ownership of the painting was there any record that it had once belonged to the Stern family — indeed, that information did not become available until several decades after the painting left the Museum’s collection,” the Met spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe artwork’s provenance and The Met’s intentions will soon be debated in Manhattan federal court, a forum where pilfered artworks and antiquities have frequently been re-examined and expatriated (the Stern heirs pursued litigation to return the painting in California in 2022, but the suit was dismissed for jurisdiction reasons).\nThe Met established a new position last year responsible for researching the provenance of 1.5 million works in its collection. Dozens of works of art and artifacts have been seized by the Manhattan district attorney’s office since 2017 over concerns about their acquisition. The museum now has a team of 11 analysts.\n“The Metropolitan Museum of Art takes seriously its longstanding commitment to address Nazi-era claims and has a long and well documented history of leading research initiatives and seeking resolution for any object that has been identified as illegally appropriated without subsequent restitution,” a Met spokeswoman said.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAaron Short is a Brooklyn-based journalist covering politics, criminal justice, real estate, the environment, and the arts.

Her death was confirmed by James Fuentes gallery, which represented her. \nKnowles worked not only between disciplines but between media, seemingly exploding the boundaries of every form she inhabited. Over a six-decade career, she was a pioneer in process-based art, relational aesthetics, computer-based art, and more, incorporating both chance and sound while drawing upon the political resonances of everyday objects. She rejected not only the boundaries of the art world, but also the borders between art object and outside world. “People don’t touch art,” she said in a 2010 oral history with the Archives of American Art. “That’s one of the problems.” Indeed, as critic Sally Deskins wrote in Hyperallergic in 2016, “Knowles asks us to physically experience the now.”\nAlison Knowles, “Music by Alison,” performed during Fully Guaranteed 12 Fluxus Concerts, New York on May 23, 1964, gelatin silver print (© Alison Knowles; photo courtesy Hannah Higgins)\nKnowles was born in the Westchester suburb of Scarsdale, New York, in 1933. She attended Middlebury College in Vermont before transferring to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, studying under painter Richard Lindner and abstract expressionist Adolph Gottlieb, as well as Color Field pioneer Josef Albers during a summer course at Syracuse University. \nIn New York in the 1950s, she found herself dabbling in all arenas of contemporary and experimental art. She both attended and performed in Allan Kaprow’s “Happenings.” She joined the New York Mycological Society, where she met luminaries like composer John Cage and artist, historian, and organizer George Maciunas. Along with those two, she was a founding member of the Fluxus movement, participating in its first performance in 1962 alongside artists like Nam June Paik as the only woman in the group. \nNewspaper clipping depicting Alison Knowles performing “The Big Book” (1967) (photo courtesy Hannah Higgins)\nKnowles married fellow Fluxus artist Dick Higgins in 1960, with whom she had twin daughters Hannah and Jessica, described in a 2002 interview as “my sisters as well as my children.” In 1963, the pair founded Something Else Press, which published intermedia book art meant to be broadly accessible. There, she would design and co-edit John Cage’s Notations (1969), a book of music manuscripts. (She and Higgins divorced in 1970.)\nAlison Knowles (center) performing “Make a salad” at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, on October 24, 1962 (photo courtesy Hannah Higgins)\nShe continued to experiment with the form in individual works, such as large-scale installations like “The Boat Book” (1979), in which “readers” could walk through pages, and works like “Bean Rolls” (1963) — a favored material for their affordability and universality — which reconstituted everyday items into books. She turned pages into instruments and worked with master papermaker Coco Gordon to create a book in which sections correspond to parts of the body (Loose Pages, 1983).\nKnowles took up Event Scores, the participatory performance form devised by George Brecht, and would go on to produce more than 100 of these works. Among her most iconic are “Make a Salad” (1962), “The Identical Lunch” (1960), and “Newspaper Music” (1962). The first, originally conceived at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, consists only of its title directive, leaning on performers to interpret and enact it. \n“It was our own way of scoring our actions or performances in a manner as serious as a score by Satie,” she told the New York Times in 2022. “A sentence like ‘Make a salad,’ that’s the event score.”\nAlison Knowles, “The House of Dust” (1967/2021) (photo by Wolfgang Günzel via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nShe was also credited for co-creating what is now considered one of the world’s first computer-generated poems with composer James Tenney. “The House of Dust” (1967), made in an early programming language on an IBM computer, will be restaged as part of the New Museum’s inaugural exhibition for its reopening.\nHer work is held in major collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Tate Modern in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.\nKnowles will be remembered for her radical interventions in form, her emphasis on the poetry in the physical world, and her insistence on art as a lived form. As the artist put it in a 2011 interview, art, for her, “was about having an excuse to get to talk to people, to notice everything that happened, to pay attention.”\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\nThe artist Jackie Ferrara, who died last week in Basel, Switzerland, at the age of 95, liked to describe herself as a methodical drone. A sculptor of graceful wooden structures and architectural environments, Ferrara didn’t mess around with materials or half-baked ideas. She only ever began building her geometric pyramids, platforms, and tapered towers after she had meticulously plotted out every angle, line, corner, and curve. Her work was born on graph paper. She loved numbers, lists, and the stark economy of Morse code.\nFerrara planned her death with the same dispassionate logic. \nThe artist was neither terminally ill nor in unbearable pain when she booked a one-way trip to Pegasos, a Swiss nonprofit specializing in physician-assisted deaths. It was the prospect of losing her independence she found intolerable. Ferrara was frail and, in her final months, rarely left the spare, spacious loft in downtown New York where she’d lived alone since 1971. She moved stiffly with a walker and, when she fell earlier this year, she was too weak to stand. The month Ferrara spent recovering in a rehab facility gave her a glimpse of what the future held in store. \n“It’s not good,” she told me when we met this summer, blinking hard and pursing her lips. “I mean, do you want to end up in bed with a bedpan?” she asked. “I gotta get outta here before that happens.” \nJackie Ferrara, “Corridor Watch” (1996), temporary installation at Michael Klein Gallery, New York \nFerrara kept a folder on her computer desktop labeled “death.” Inside, there was nothing but a link to the Pegasos website. Before she fell, she would occasionally click on the link, then close the window. One day after the stint in rehab, Ferrara thought “fuck it,” and began bushwhacking through the paperwork. No, she didn’t have any pets. No, she wouldn’t like any music. Yes, she was sure. \nThe artist chose Switzerland because it’s one of the only places in the world where people who aren’t gravely ill can arrange physician-assisted deaths. “If I could go to Second Avenue and Houston or something, I would,” she said. Ferrara would have done it sooner if she could. October 22, 2025, was the first available appointment. Some people with limited time think about bucket lists; Ferrara thought about toilet paper. “How do I figure out how much I might need in the next three months at most?” she wondered aloud. \nBorn in Detroit in 1929, Ferrara achieved a rare level of renown for a woman artist of her generation. Entirely self-taught, she arrived at her mature work — geometric structures she built by stacking strips of plywood and planks of poplar, pine, basswood, and birch — in the early 1970s. Over the next several decades, dozens of major museums acquired her work, and she completed monumental commissions across the country: an amphitheater for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a tiled floor for the Pittsburgh International Airport, and mosaics for the Grand Central subway station, to name only a few.\nJackie Ferrara, “302 Grand Central: Towers, Arches, Pyramids” (1997–2000/2021)\nBut the way Ferrara told it, her career was a gigantic fluke. A prominent figure on the downtown scene in an overwhelmingly male art world, Ferrara tended to dismiss her achievements as chance accidents or state them so matter-of-factly they seemed banal. She only began making sculptures, she claimed, because Mary Frank (wife of the photographer Robert Frank) gave her some wax to play with one summer in Provincetown, Massachusetts. How her early, figurative works became the cerebral, mathematical structures for which she’s known didn’t inspire much reflection from Ferrara. One early seven-foot sculpture was “just a pyramid,” and when it appeared in a summer group show at the A.M. Sachs Gallery, the press it received was happenstance. “There’s not much happening during the summer,” she told an interviewer in 2012. Even her revels with giants of contemporary art history — poker games with Sol LeWitt, shuffleboard with Carl Andre, late nights that bled into early mornings with Robert Smithson — were always someone else’s idea. “I never initiated it,” she said. “I just happened to be somewhere with somebody and tagged along.” \nFerrara’s self-deprecation went beyond modesty or coy understatement. Her insistence on being a passenger in her own life was maddening. It also wasn’t true. Despite everything she said, Ferrara had a firm hold on her destiny.\nJackie Ferrara, “Norwalk Platform” (1984) in Memorial Lake Park, Norwalk, Ohio (courtesy the Jackie Ferrara Foundation)\nRaised in Detroit during the Great Depression, Ferrara dreamed of moving to New York from a young age. It seemed like she might not make it there when she married the first guy who asked and dropped out of Michigan State University after one desultory year. She was pregnant almost immediately. “I was incredibly ignorant,” she said. “I would have had an abortion, but I didn’t know such a thing existed.” Her son, Brit, was born in 1951. Ferrara was miserable. Late one night, she brought her baby to “some place that boarded children,” left her husband a note letting him know where he could find their child, and boarded a red-eye flight to New York. \nThis was not a sacrifice Ferrara made to pursue her art. She had no real ambitions at the time. When she landed in New York, she figured she’d be a go-go dancer. Perhaps it’s not surprising that when Ferrara did become an artist years later, she built ramparts — literal towers and walls — to shield this reckless woman from view. Insisting on her own lack of imagination (she often said she possessed “the soul of a file clerk”), Ferrara contained the destructive mayhem of her life behind aloof, systematic sculptures.\n“I came here actually thinking at some point that I would go back and get Brit and live with him here,” she said. “But,” she added in a whisper, “I didn’t.” Once it came up, Ferrara often spoke about leaving her son. She was talking about the artists Mel Bochner and Dorothea Rockburne one day when she suddenly broke off. “All these people who love their children, and here’s me who abandoned mine,” she said. Some of these interjections were so random, it seemed like Ferrara was still wrapping her head around being the kind of person who chooses personal happiness over her child. If Ferrara was ashamed of her decision, though, she didn’t seem to regret it.\nJackie Ferrara, “266 Stone Court” (1988) at the General Mills Sculpture Garden in Minneapolis\nSometime in the early 1990s, Ferrara made a sculpture called “Arena 7.” Blond plywood walls frame a central, rectangular space with a doorway at either end. Ferrara said she’d been thinking about Frank R. Stockton’s short story “The Lady, or the Tiger?” (1882), in which a young man trapped in the arena of a barbaric king must choose between two doors. Behind one lies happiness in the form of a beautiful maiden; behind the other, certain death by savage tiger. The man’s lover, the princess, gestures to the right, but the story ends before we learn whether she was saving him or sending him to his death. When Ferrara was in junior high, she wrote a different ending. In her version, the young man knows the princess “wasn’t to be trusted,” and escapes through the opposite door. In many ways, Ferrara was that ruthless princess, but she was also the young man — the one who, in her telling, escaped his doom by taking a colossal risk.\nThe last time I saw Ferrara was in August. She was giddy. Her trip to Switzerland was only two months away. “I’m looking forward to it,” she said. “I’m going to be their jolliest customer.” Sunlight flooded the corner where Ferrara sat behind a pale wooden desk beside her neatly made bed. She wore a loose red T-shirt under navy blue overalls, red slippers, and her silver hair in a mop of curls. Blue and purple veins shone through her skin. It was weird, she said, knowing she wouldn’t be around for New York City’s mayoral election or live to see the garden her neighbors were planning on the roof she’d looked down on for 54 years. Not weird enough, though, to make her question her decision. “None of this makes me feel bad, truly,” she said, holding my gaze with her large dark eyes. \nNear us, a dozen of Ferrara’s small wooden sculptures sat on tables and shelves. In static photos, they can seem rigid and impersonal, but that afternoon, in the golden summer light, they looked almost alive. The radiant slats of rosy wood and bands of shadow between them seemed to flicker and strobe. Walking around them, they appeared to rotate, warp, tilt, and skew. The artist Laurie Anderson put it succinctly in a 1974 review for Artforum: “They are more about verbs than nouns.” Although Ferrara’s sculptures emerged from clinical diagrams on paper, their physical presence in the world is unruly. Ferrara might have sought to contain the chaos of her life in precise, geometric forms, but their subtle unpredictability reflects her own.\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe Renais­sance did not, strict­ly speak­ing, occur in Chi­na. Yet it seems that the Mid­dle King­dom did have its Renais­sance men, so to speak, and in much ear­li­er times at that. We find one such illus­tri­ous fig­ure in the Han dynasty of the first and sec­ond cen­turies: a states­man named Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), who man­aged to dis­tin­guish him­self across a range of fields from math­e­mat­ics to astron­o­my to phi­los­o­phy to poet­ry. His accom­plish­ments in sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy include invent­ing the first hydraulic armil­lary sphere for observ­ing the heav­ens, improv­ing water clocks with a sec­ondary tank, cal­cu­lat­ing pi fur­ther than it had been in Chi­na to date, and mak­ing dis­cov­er­ies about the nature of the moon. He also, so records show, put togeth­er the first-ever seis­mo­scope, a device for detect­ing earth­quakes.\nA visu­al expla­na­tion of Zhang’s design appears in the Sci­ence­World video above. His seis­mo­scope, its nar­ra­tor says, “was called hòufēng dìdòngyí, which means ‘instru­ment for mea­sur­ing sea­son­al winds and move­ments of the earth,’ ” and it could “deter­mine rough­ly the direc­tion in which an earth­quake occurred.”\nEach of its eight drag­on heads (a com­bi­na­tion of num­ber and crea­ture that, in Chi­na, could hard­ly be more aus­pi­cious) holds a ball; when the ground shook, the drag­on point­ing toward the epi­cen­ter of the quake drops its ball into the mouth of one of the dec­o­ra­tive toads wait­ing below. At one time, as his­to­ry has record­ed, it “detect­ed an earth­quake 650 kilo­me­ters, or 400 miles away, that was­n’t felt at the loca­tion of the seis­mo­scope.”\nNot bad, con­sid­er­ing that nei­ther Zhang nor any­one else had yet heard of tec­ton­ic plates. But as all engi­neers know, prac­ti­cal devices often work just fine even in the absence of com­plete­ly sound the­o­ry. Though no con­tem­po­rary exam­ples of hòufēng dìdòngyí sur­vive from Zhang’s time, “researchers believe that inside the seis­mo­scope were a pen­du­lum, a bronze ball under the pen­du­lum, eight chan­nels, and eight levers that acti­vat­ed the drag­ons’ mouths.” Mov­ing in response to a shock wave, the pen­du­lum would release the ball in the oppo­site direc­tion, which would roll down a chan­nel and release the mouth at the end of it. How­ev­er inno­v­a­tive it was for its time, this scheme could, of course, pro­vide no infor­ma­tion about exact­ly how far away the earth­quake hap­pened, to say noth­ing of pre­dic­tion. For­tu­nate­ly, cen­turies of Renais­sance men still lay ahead to fig­ure all that out.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Greeks Invent­ed the First Com­put­er: An Intro­duc­tion to the Antikythera Mech­a­nism (Cir­ca 87 BC)\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nBehold Col­or Pho­tographs Tak­en Dur­ing the After­math of San Francisco’s Dev­as­tat­ing 1906 Earth­quake\nChina’s 8,000 Ter­ra­cot­ta War­riors: An Ani­mat­ed & Inter­ac­tive Intro­duc­tion to a Great Archae­o­log­i­cal Dis­cov­ery\nWhat Ancient Chi­nese Phi­los­o­phy Can Teach Us About Liv­ing the Good Life Today: Lessons from Harvard’s Pop­u­lar Pro­fes­sor, Michael Puett\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nJoy Machine is thrilled to present World in My Eyes, a duo exhibition of Chicago artists Kayla Mahaffey and Joseph Perez, a.k.a. Sentrock.\nWorld in My Eyes is, first and foremost, rooted in the lives of everyday people. Both Sentrock and Mahaffey have long depicted friends and neighbors in their own Chicago neighborhoods, exploring how our city shapes its youngest residents. How are children cared for? How are their imaginations and dreams nurtured? These questions recur throughout both artists’ practices and always hinge on another: how do children thrive amid turmoil, whether political, cultural, or personal?\nSentrock, “Better days ahead” (2026), spray paint and latex paint on canvas, 36 x 48 inches\nIn World in My Eyes, Sentrock’s signature bird character meets Mahaffey’s energetic cast. Each artist confronts an underlying struggle—whether an unrealized dream or a physical need—not through an unrealistic swaddle of optimism but rather through the often-repeated idea that hope is a practice. For children, and for all of us seeking a better tomorrow, hope starts with courage.\nAn opening reception will be held from 6 to 9 p.m. on January 30. RSVP.

Traveling to the Okinawa prefecture in the hopes of encountering a scarcely documented species of larval goosefish, Kovacs spent nearly two weeks blackwater diving before photographing the rare moment. \n“Unfortunately, this beautiful little fish turned out to be incredibly uncooperative and difficult to photograph,” Kovacs says. “After spending some time with it, I was very fortunate that, for one brief moment, it decided to yawn while facing the camera.” The resulting image is aptly titled “Tired fish.”\nSteven Kovacs, “Tired Fish,” Kumejima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan\nThis past year, the annual contest saw thousands of entries spanning more than 90 countries. From silky sharks in Cuba to small pipefish in Indonesia, each photograph highlights unique, fleeting underwater moments that often go unseen.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn his forthcoming solo exhibition, Building Identities Through Style, Glenn Hardy Jr. excavates the strata of fashion, especially how identities are shaped and perceived through appearance. \nBased in Washington, D.C., Hardy is a self-taught painter whose bold portraits emphasize Black life “liberated from the burdens of racial stereotypes and conflict,” says Charlie James Gallery, which is currently presenting the show. The figures in Hardy’s compositions often engage in everyday leisure activities or settle into places of refuge and camaraderie, like studios, athletic courts, and domestic spaces.\n“Mannequin | Cherry Blossoms” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 40 x 30 inches\nBuilding Identities Through Style emphasizes fashion as more than simply personal expression or “self-celebration,” as described in a statement. Hardy examines the complexities of garments, trends, and luxury through the lens of desire and access, juxtaposing elements of reality and fantasy—especially in a series of paintings of mannequins topped with realistic visages, like individual characters being pieced together as their tailored apparel takes shape.\nThe artist is interested in how sartorial choices nod to complex systems of negotiation and judgment that inform our understanding of conformity, difference, and a sense of belonging. “Hardy not only interrogates the manner in which Black bodies are seen and assessed, but also the ways in which stylistic excellence has become both reputational armor and a source of joy, experimentation, and play,” the gallery says.\n“Soar Thumb,” for example, portrays a group of men in an elevator, all but one of whom are dressed in nearly identical suits and sport short haircuts. The outlier is a tall individual with bold dreadlocks and a white tank top, standing confidently with his arms crossed and gazing directly at the viewer. \n“Soar Thumb” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 36 x 36 inches\nHardy frames the contrast not as an act of rebellion but as a means of parsing how, within a shared space, some find conformity to bring a sense of safety or comfort, while others view individual expression to be—in addition to its liberating nature—a kind of buffer or armor.\n“The suited figures are not antagonists but participants in the same system of social evaluation, using uniformity as protection,” says a statement. “The outlier is neither hero nor foil; he is exposed. The work asks not which presentation is more authentic, but what each form of visibility costs.”\nBuilding Identities Through Style continues through February 7 in Los Angeles.

    "body": "\n            The city of Philadelphia is suing the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the National Park Service (NPS) after officials removed wall text and illustrations describing slavery from a historical park on Thursday, January 22. The removal of exhibits about slavery from Independence National Historical Park comes months after Trump named the site in an executive order calling for reviews of exhibits at the Smithsonian and the National Parks system. Footage captured by the Philadelphia Inquirer shows staff dismantling labels from an exhibition about slavery within the park, which houses the Liberty Bell and the residence of the first United States presidents. The Constitution and Declaration of Independence were also signed on the site’s grounds.In his March 2025 executive order, Trump ordered the DOI, which oversees the NPS, to “take action” to ensure displays at its sites do not “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”A close-up shot of a removed panel describing the history of slaveryAccording to Philadelphia’s lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court, the removed items were part of the $8.5 million outdoor exhibition Freedom and Slavery in Making a New Nation, created in 2009 on the park’s President's House. The exhibition commemorated the lives of nine enslaved individuals whom George Washington brought to his residence. One panel, titled “The Dirty Business of Slavery,” described the Constitution’s failure to outlaw slavery, including its designation of enslaved individuals as three-fifths of a person. It also contained a graphic depicting the routes of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The panel further stated that after the US outlawed the importation of enslaved people, the enslaved population still grew, in part due to forced breeding resulting from the rape of enslaved women by White men.

The spokesperson condemned the City of Philadelphia for “filing frivolous lawsuits in the hopes of demeaning our brave Founding Fathers who set the brilliant road map for the greatest country in the world.” A close-up shot of a removed panel describing the history of slaveryExpecting drastic modifications to the country’s National Park signage, the Minnesota-born project Save Our Signs has already documented the contents of Independence National Historical Park exhibit and others across the country in a public database containing thousands of images. “We at Save Our Signs are angered and disappointed to learn about the removal of the President's House exhibit,” librarian Molly Blake, a founding member of Save Our Signs, told Hyperallergic. “[...] The administration's removal of this exhibit is an act of top-down censorship of history that makes those who agree with this administration's ideology uncomfortable.” Photos from the exhibition collected by Save Our Signs, before its alteration, show detailed text of the removed signage, as well as other exhibits, including a video work accompanied by a text describing how George Washington kept a rotation of enslaved individuals in and out of the state so that they would not become free under Pennsylvania law. In court, Philadelphia argued that the NPS did not have the authority to remove the exhibits, which the city had commissioned in partnership with the federal government. \"The whole site was the result of many years of community organizing and dialogue between local activists, historians, civic leaders, artists, political leaders, and government workers from the city, state, and federal government,\" Massiah told Hyperallergic.An exhibition item documented by Save Our SignsBlake noted that “while we have some photographs of this exhibit, these photographs can never replace the interpretive panels that have been removed.”“The photos help us remember what has been lost, but they are not a replacement for the exhibit, which belongs at the President's House,” Blake said.The extent to which the NPS dismantled the exhibition is unclear. The lawsuit requests the court to stop further removal of “any exhibits, panels, artwork, or other items from the President’s House Site” and asks the DOI “to ensure the safety, security, and preservation of any such items removed from the President’s House Site.” \"In remembering the nine enslaved Africans brought to that house from Virginia by the Washingtons, [the exhibition] allows all of us to understand the presence and crucial role played by Black Americans in the early years of this country,\" Massiah told Hyperallergic. “And also the decisions made about citizenship that have continued to be a major vector in shaping the American experiment.”\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                      \n                        Philadelphia\n                      \n                  \n        ",

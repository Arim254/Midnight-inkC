    "body": "\n\tin History, Literature |   \tOctober 13th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nMy Pen­guin Clas­sics copy of Mark Twain’s Life on the Mis­sis­sip­pi sits alone atop an over­full shelf. There is a book­mark on page 204, exact­ly halfway through, torn from an in-flight duty-free catalog—whiskey and fan­cy pens. It tells me “hey, you for­got to fin­ish this, you [var­i­ous obscen­i­ties].” And I shrug. What can I say? I went to grad school, where I learned to read ten books at once and nev­er fin­ish one. Good thing Mark Twain didn’t write that way, or we might not have Life on the Mis­sis­sip­pi.\nTwain was a dili­gent and con­sci­en­tious writer with a mem­o­ry like a bear trap, or at least that’s what he want­ed us to think. But some­where in his rem­i­nis­cence he may have been con­fused. Twain wrote in his 1904 auto­bi­og­ra­phy that his first nov­el writ­ten on a type­writer—the first type­writ­ten nov­el at all—was Tom Sawyer.\nWas this so? Twain pur­chased his first type­writer (which prob­a­bly looked like the Sholes and Glid­den seen here) in 1874 for $125. In 1875, he writes in a let­ter to the Rem­ing­ton com­pa­ny that he is no longer using his type­writer; it cor­rupts his morals because it makes him want to swear. He gives the infer­nal machine away, twice. It returns to him each time.\nThe year after Twain’s moral trou­ble with his Rem­ing­ton, Tom Sawyer is pub­lished from hand­writ­ten man­u­script, not typed. Then, sev­en years lat­er, Life on the Mis­sis­sip­pi (1883) comes to the pub­lish­er in type­script. Twain did not type it himself—he had pre­sum­ably renounced the act—but he dic­tat­ed the mem­oir to a typ­ist from a hand­writ­ten draft. Now, I can hear you quib­bling…  Life on the Mis­sis­sip­pi isn’t a nov­el at all! Well, okay, fair enough. Let’s just say it’s the first type­writ­ten book and call it a day, eh? Go read this excel­lent New York­er piece on the ear­ly life of the type­writer and leave me alone. I’ve got a book to fin­ish.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\n\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn 1973, Peter Tomp­kins and Christo­pher Bird’s The Secret Life of Plants became a best­seller. Draw­ing from the results of sci­en­tif­ic stud­ies about whose replic­a­bil­i­ty we may now feel cer­tain doubts, the book sug­gest­ed that emo­tion, and indeed sen­tience, belong not just to humans and ani­mals, but also to, say, the pot­ted fern in your liv­ing room. Many of Tomp­kins and Bird’s read­ers must have owned such a plant, and prob­a­bly a vari­ety of oth­ers besides, giv­en the nine­teen-sev­en­ties’ fad for domes­tic veg­e­ta­tion. Though ridiculed in the major media, The Secret Life of Plants proved suf­fi­cient­ly in tune with its time to inspire a fea­ture-length doc­u­men­tary film with a high-tech sound­track by none oth­er than Ste­vie Won­der.\nDid Won­der ever hear the album Moth­er Earth­’s Plan­ta­sia? Sub­ti­tled Warm Earth Music for Plants… and the Peo­ple Who Love Them, the album also fea­tures elec­tron­ic com­po­si­tions — exclu­sive­ly elec­tron­ic com­po­si­tions, in fact, per­formed entire­ly with a Moog syn­the­siz­er. Its com­pos­er Mort Gar­son had been a ver­sa­tile pro­fes­sion­al in the world of what was then called “easy lis­ten­ing,” and worked on the writ­ing, arrange­ment, or pro­duc­tion of pop­u­lar songs like Bren­da Lee’s “Dyna­mite,” Ruby & The Roman­tics’ “Our Day Will Come,” The Sand­pipers’ “Guan­tanam­era,” and Bill With­ers’ “Three Nights and a Morn­ing.” Upon meet­ing Robert Moog him­self at a con­ven­tion in 1967, Gar­son seems to have under­gone a con­ver­sion, becom­ing one of the first com­posers to ded­i­cate him­self to explor­ing the musi­cal poten­tial of the then-nov­el syn­the­siz­er tech­nol­o­gy.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe music Gar­son went on to make with his Moog reflects the zeit­geist: there was Elec­tron­ic Hair Pieces, with ver­sions of num­bers from the musi­cal Hair, a series of twelve discs based on the signs of the zodi­ac, and even the score that accom­pa­nied the Apol­lo 11 moon land­ing broad­cast. Of par­tic­u­lar inter­est to ear­ly elec­tron­ic music buffs is Black Mass, for which Gar­son took the pseu­do­nym Lucifer, and which ought to be worth adding to one’s library with Hal­loween com­ing up.\nMoth­er Earth­’s Plan­ta­sia was released in 1976, three years before the Secret Life of Plants movie, though released may not be the right word: it could only be obtained free with pur­chase of either a house­plant from a shop called Moth­er Earth on Mel­rose Avenue in Los Ange­les or a Sim­mons mat­tress from Sears. As music YouTu­ber David Hart­ley explains in his lat­est video, Gar­son was asked to cre­ate an album of music con­ducive to plant growth by Moth­er Earth­’s own­ers, Lynn and Joel Rapp.\n\n\n\t\n\nFor decades there­after, Moth­er Earth­’s Plan­ta­sia could pre­sum­ably be encoun­tered by seri­ous crate-dig­gers: the Phar­cyde, for exam­ple, sam­pled one of its tracks on “Guestlist” in 2000. But it was only in the twen­ty-tens, after the estab­lish­ment of YouTube and its obscure-music-upload­ing cul­ture, that the album found an audi­ence appre­cia­tive enough to inspire a prop­er release. (Its redis­cov­ery played out sim­i­lar­ly to that of Mariya Takeuchi’s “Plas­tic Love,” the gold­en tip of the Japan­ese city pop revival.) Its tracks even­tu­al­ly even appeared in ad cam­paigns for Tur­b­o­Tax and the French super­mar­ket chain Inter­marché. To lis­ten­ers today, they may sound uncan­ni­ly like video game music as it would take shape in the eight­ies, albeit with a soft-edged ana­log tex­ture. As far as whether it actu­al­ly helps plants grow, even Joel Rap­p’s lin­er notes can only man­age the promise that “it could­n’t pos­si­bly hurt.” But I can report that it does a decent job putting my infant twins to sleep.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow the Moog Syn­the­siz­er Changed the Sound of Music\nGraph­ic Shows the House Plants That Nat­u­ral­ly Clean the Air in Your Home, Accord­ing to a NASA Study\nMoog This!: Hear a Playlist Fea­tur­ing 36 Hours of Music Made with the Leg­endary Ana­log Syn­the­siz­er\nPlants Emit High-Pitched Sounds When They Get Cut, or Stressed by Drought, a New Study Shows\nWendy Car­los’ Switched on Bach Turns 50 This Month: Learn How the Clas­si­cal Synth Record Intro­duced the World to the Moog\nA Shaz­am for Nature: A New Free App Helps You Iden­ti­fy Plants, Ani­mals & Oth­er Denizens of the Nat­ur­al World\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor Lydia Ricci, a broken pencil, outdated forms, long-ago paid bills, and tattered bits of fabric are prime materials for her elaborate, small-scale worlds. The artist credits her parents’ obsession with collecting as the beginning of what’s grown into a scrap-centric process. \n“My mother was an immigrant from the Ukraine who could improvise anything when we didn’t have exactly what we needed, which was most of the time. And my Italian father hasn’t ever thrown anything away because one day it might be useful, or some day he might get around to fixing it,” she writes.\nDetail of “It’s What’s Inside” (2025), collected scrap materials, 10 x 38 x 13 centimeters\nToday, Ricci pieces together bits and baubles collected for the past 30 years that many other artists might relegate to the trash. Cardboard, candy wrappers, vintage tumblers, and so much more form uncanny miniatures that she refers to as “observations of what people anticipate, complain about, or muse over. Fleeting, unscripted exchanges—mundane yet deeply human—are a continual source of inspiration.”\nMeticulous and playful, the resulting sculptures retain a messy, raw quality that is itself a collection of the original materials. Rather than mask irregularities and signs of wear, Ricci leaves traces of chaos and disorder that capture an authentic quality of modern life.\nFind much more from the artist on Instagram.\n“It’s What’s Inside” (2025), collected scrap materials, 10 x 38 x 13 centimeters\n“That’s Everything” (2024), collected scrap materials, 30 x 35 x 16 centimeters\n“They Were Just Playing” (2024), vintage red Pizza Hut tumblers and collected scrap materials, 90 x 40 x 40 centimeters\nDetail of “They Were Just Playing” (2024), vintage red Pizza Hut tumblers and collected scrap materials, 90 x 40 x 40 centimeters\nDetail of “They Made It Look So Easy” (2024), collected scrap materials, 22 x 26 x 15 centimeters\n“We Should Have Taken Better Care of It” (2023), collected scrap materials, 8  x 8 x 10 centimeters\n“How Did You Get So Good?” (2024), Ukrainian embroidery and collected scrap materials, 8 x 8 x 21 centimeters\n“Take a Turn” (2025), collected scrap materials, 80 x 46 x 5 centimeters\nDetail of “Take a Turn” (2025), collected scrap materials, 80 x 46 x 5 centimeters\n“I Think We Got Disconnected” (2025), collected scrap materials, 22 x 32 x 20 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJaune Quick-to-See Smith, \"Indian Map\" (1992) in the exhibition Memory Map at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2023 (photo Hrag Vartanian, Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThis summer, I took Diné Bizaad (Navajo language) and Diné history classes at Diné College in Tsaile, Arizona, on the Navajo Nation. My time there reminded me of Indigenous tenacity — the quiet, daily work of Native language and history professors, art teachers, staff, and students who sustain culture from within. Their commitment keeps Indigenous languages, knowledge systems, and creative practices alive for future generations. \nAs Native American people, many of our ancestors survived their own versions of erasure under colonial rule. This Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we are witnessing another chapter of that same violence unfold in Palestine — an all-too-familiar attempt at genocide, streamed to us in real time. At home, the ongoing American colonial project continues to meet resistance, a presence I felt in the classrooms of Diné College. My Diné grandparents were forced to leave their Diné Bizaad-speaking families as young children to attend Christian, English-speaking boarding schools sanctioned by the United States government. Shimásání (my grandmother) always encouraged me to learn Diné Bizaad and Diné history. Our ancestors’ strength laid the road for us, and it’s our responsibility to walk it with that same courage. \nFrom the classrooms of tribal colleges to the galleries of major museums, Indigenous perseverance continues to shape art and culture. Building on generations of resilience, contemporary Native artists are asserting their presence boldly across institutions. Jeffrey Gibson’s (Mississippi Choctaw/Cherokee) bronze animal sculptures currently line The Met’s facade, and his exhibition An Indigenous Present — co-curated with others — features works by 15 Indigenous artists spanning the past century. It’s now on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and will tour nationally. Before she passed earlier this year, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith (Citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nation) curated Indigenous Identities: Here, Now & Always at Rutgers University’s Zimmerli Art Museum, featuring 97 living Indigenous artists. Andrea Carlson’s (Grand Portage Ojibwe and European settler descent) first museum survey, A Constant Sky, opened recently at the Denver Art Museum. Kent Monkman (Fisher River Cree Nation) recently opened his largest solo exhibition, History is Painted by the Victors, at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Dyani White Hawk’s (Sičáŋǧu Lakota) Love Language, a major survey of her work, opens October 18 at the Walker Art Center. It’s an exhilarating moment for Native art, as Indigenous voices shape institutions and audiences on a national and international scale.\nFrom left to right: Sháńdíín Brown, Sarah Biscarra Dilley of Forge Project, Laurent Bergeron, and his partner, artist Kent Monkman (photo courtesy Sháńdíín Brown)\nThis Indigenous Peoples’ Day, I encourage readers to support Native-led, non-profit art organizations like Ma’s House, the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), the Aquinnah Cultural Center, the Tomaquag Museum, Forge Project, the Native Arts + Cultures Foundation (NACF), or your local tribal cultural center, museum, or college. These organizations nurture Native artists, thinkers, and culture bearers. Indigenous art and culture are not only surviving, they’re thriving. But sustaining that future requires support. Acknowledging Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Indigenous survivance is a start, but there’s a critical need to turn recognition into tangible action. The next Jeffrey Gibson might be sitting in a classroom at IAIA right now. IAIA’s federal funding remains unstable, a consequence of budget policies initiated under the Trump administration. This instability underscores a larger truth: after generations of using education to erase Native languages, arts, and knowledge systems, today’s federal support for Indigenous-led tribal colleges — spaces now viewed as “DEI” — isn’t an act of goodwill: it’s a legal and treaty-bound obligation. With all the violence and uncertainty in the world, we need Native-led art and culture spaces. Even $10 helps — the price of an iced coffee in New York City. For readers who may not be able to donate, following these organizations on social media and advocating for their funding is another meaningful way to engage. \nAt the past Santa Fe Indian Market, I volunteered with Forge Project to supply free food and cold drinks to vendors. We handed out 1,000 burritos that day. It was a hopeful moment — one rooted in care, kinship, and action. Like the classrooms at Diné College, it reminded me that Indigenous perseverance lives in both the grand moments and smaller, collective acts of generosity. Being together, learning together, and acting together keep my hope strong. A common phrase in Diné Bizaad is “T’áá hó’ájitéégóó,” which loosely translates to “it’s up to you,” a reminder of our personal agency amid the challenges we inherit and the futures we are building.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSháńdíín Brown is a curator, creative, and citizen of the Navajo Nation from Arizona.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJudy Ledgerwood, \"Golden Hour\" (2025),\noil on canvas, 84 × 96 inches (~2.1 × 2.4 m) (all photos courtesy Gray Gallery)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nIt was immediately apparent when I walked into Gray Gallery’s spacious, living room-like uptown space that the dimensions of the four paintings in Judy Ledgerwood’s exhibition were determined by those of the walls on which they hung. A single work occupied two of the walls, while two equally sized canvases held a dialogue on the third.  \nLedgerwood’s manipulation of formal structure within individual works accelerated my appreciation of her play with dimensions, from the skewed linear grid of unequal triangles occupied by a hand-drawn trefoil in “Vitamin C” (all works 2025) to the vibrant opticality of different trefoils, some of them mirrored, dispersed across a monochromatic ground in “Crepuscolo.” Hung on opposite walls, this pairing made me look more closely at how each of the four paintings talked to each other as well as held their own ground.\n\nJudy Ledgerwood, “Alpen Glow” (2025), oil on canvas, 84 × 96 inches (~2.1 × 2.4 m) \nI have always thought of Ledgerwood as a consummate painter who transformed the rigidity of Pattern and Decoration’s reliance on repetition into a mode of improvisation and surprise. The eye-opener was the manner in which she undid the movement’s decorous decorum into something fanciful, forthright, and frankly vulgar. This goes back to Willem de Kooning’s ostentatious nudes and their trace of misogyny, which Ledgerwood also upends. The quatrefoils and trefoils we see in her paintings are comical evocations of female genitalia, a bad boy’s graffiti on a bathroom wall. I once compared them to “Henri Matisse’s cut-outs […] romanced by anthropomorphic cartoon mice.” And yet, what we see is not vulgarity, but the frank celebration of female sexuality. I am reminded of something the painter David Reed once said to his dealer, Nicholas Wilder: “My ambition in life is to be a bedroom painter.”\n“Crepusculo” is a pulsating field of mauve quatrefoils and distorted variations on an orange field. Ledgerwood has painted an orange rectangle whose top and bottom edge sags in the middle against the strict edges of her stretched canvas. With rivulets of orange and mauve dripping along the bottom edge, the irregular rectangle becomes a cloth, like the cerulean blue and yellow one we see draped over a turquoise screen in Henri Matisse’s “The Pink Studio” (1911). The difference is that Ledgerwood’s cloth is made of paint, drips and all. I think the artist wanted to extricate this piece of decorative fabric from the harem, a space both private and public, to the intimate space of the bedroom. Seeing is private.\n\nJudy Ledgerwood, “Crepusculo” (2025), oil on canvas, 84 ¼ × 92 inches (2.1 × 2.3 m)\nWhile disegno (drawing), embodied by “Vitamin C,” and colore (color), embodied by “Crepuscolo,” were considered rival aesthetic approaches in Renaissance Italy, Ledgerwood complicates the matter with the pairing of the identically sized rectangles “Alpen Glow” and “Golden Hour” on the same wall. Made of a crazy quilt of mostly triangles in colors such as pale pink, blue, violet, and orange, as well as solid lines and stained areas, “Golden Hour” transports different strains of American painting, such as Minimalism’s grid, stain painting, and Pattern and Decoration, into a feminist worldview without becoming didactic. Some triangles are aligned so that they flip between flat shapes and two sides of a pyramid — that is, two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality. Lines of her trefoils meet across triangles and become quatrefoils, proving that odd numbers can fit into even ones. Some trefoils resemble graffiti penises and balls, while others look like the monochromatic silhouette of a cartoon rodent. Antic humor, joyful irreverence, aesthetic disquisition, and art history embrace each other.\nLedgerwood draws many of the trefoils in a line of thick paint, as in the saturated colors of “Alpen Glow.” Some drip. In the open space where two meet, we see a thick twist of paint whose evocative ambiguity brought to mind lines from Gertrude Stein’s erotic masterpiece, Tender Buttons (1914): “Light blue and the same red with purple makes a change. It shows that there is no mistake. Any pink shows that and very likely it is reasonable.” Working within a limited vocabulary, Ledgerwood keeps finding ways to open up new doors to visually sensuous pleasures.\n\nJudy Ledgerwood, “Vitamin C” (2025), oil on canvas, 90 × 144 inches (~2.3 × 3.7 m)\nJudy Ledgerwood: Twilight in the Wilderness continues at Gray New York (1018 Madison Avenue, Floor 2, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through November 1. The exhibition was organized by the gallery. \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Yau is an award winning poet, critic, curator, and publisher of Black Square Editions.

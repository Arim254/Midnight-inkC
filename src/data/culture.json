    "body": "\n\tin Psychology |   \tNovember 17th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn the two-thou­sands, the magi­cian-come­di­ans Penn and Teller host­ed a tele­vi­sion series called Bull­shit! In it, they took on a vari­ety of cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­na they regard­ed as wor­thy of the tit­u­lar epi­thet, from ESP to Area 51, exor­cism to cre­ation­ism, feng shui to haute cui­sine. Their sar­don­ic argu­ments were enriched by clips of assort­ed inter­vie­wees —speak­ing in defense of the top­ic of the day. Penn once addressed the view­ers, say­ing that we might won­der why any­one agrees to come on the show, giv­en how they must know it will make them come off. But every­one, he explained, con­fi­dent­ly believes that their own ideas are the cor­rect ones.\nThat episode came right to mind while watch­ing the new Ver­i­ta­si­um video above, which deals with the phe­nom­e­non of over­con­fi­dence. Like the oft-cit­ed 93 per­cent of Amer­i­cans who believe them­selves bet­ter dri­vers than the medi­an, we all fall vic­tim to that afflic­tion at one time or anoth­er, to one degree or anoth­er; the more inter­est­ing mat­ter under inves­ti­ga­tion is why that should be so.\nOne can always point to what T. S. Eliot called “the end­less strug­gle to think well of them­selves”: want­i­ng to believe that we know it all, we take pains to present our­selves as if we do. But as explained by the pro­fes­sors inter­viewed here, Carnegie Mel­lon’s Baruch Fis­chhoff and Berke­ley’s Don A. Moore (author of Per­fect­ly Con­fi­dent: How to Cal­i­brate Your Deci­sions Wise­ly), the research has also revealed oth­er poten­tial fac­tors in play.\nOne impor­tant can­di­date is, as ever, stu­pid­i­ty. Much has been made of the Dun­ning-Kruger effect, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, which holds that the less com­pe­tent peo­ple are at a task, the more con­fi­dent they tend to be about their abil­i­ty to per­form it. That would seem to accord with much of our every­day expe­ri­ence, but we should also con­sid­er the role played by the basic cog­ni­tive lim­i­ta­tions that apply to us all. Our brains can only process so much at once, and when they come up against capac­i­ty, they default to sim­pli­fied, and often too-sim­pli­fied, ver­sions of the prob­lem before them. It all becomes more dif­fi­cult if we’re insu­lat­ed from direct, objec­tive feed­back, a con­di­tion that often results from the kind of suc­cess and esteem that can be achieved by pro­ject­ing — you guessed it — con­fi­dence.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhy Incom­pe­tent Peo­ple Think They’re Com­pe­tent: The Dun­ning-Kruger Effect, Explained\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tNovember 17th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPunk rock and heavy met­al were two gen­res that evolved over the ‘70s, but seemed to run par­al­lel to each oth­er, despite shar­ing com­mon fash­ion, sounds, and atti­tudes. But then there are moments in his­to­ry, where every­body plays togeth­er in the same sand­box. For exam­ple, the above remas­tered audio, which cap­tures the Aus­tralian band AC/DC on their first Amer­i­can tour, play­ing New York’s CBGB, syn­ony­mous now with punk and new wave music.\nThe date is August 24, 1977, and AC/DC were on a cross-coun­try trip that had tak­en in both club dates and are­nas, where they supported—yes, hard to believe, I know—REO Speed­wag­on. Their album Let There Be Rock had just dropped in June. The band would be in the States until the win­ter.\nThis CBGB gig finds them on the same bill as Talk­ing Heads and the Dead Boys, accord­ing to a poster from the time. And while there’s no video for this show, you can find a few pho­tos that doc­u­ment the con­cert here. You can feel the mug­gy New York sum­mer in these pho­tos, but also the excite­ment of an unfor­get­table gig.\nAt 15 min­utes, the set is short, but still three min­utes longer than the Ramones’ first set at the same club three years ear­li­er. That’s pret­ty met­al, man.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nNYC’s Icon­ic Punk Club CBG­Bs Comes Alive in a Bril­liant Short Ani­ma­tion, Using David Godlis’ Pho­tos of Pat­ti Smith, The Ramones & More\nCBGB’s Hey­day: Watch The Ramones, The Dead Boys, Bad Brains, Talk­ing Heads & Blondie Per­form Live (1974–1982)\nLis­ten to Pat­ti Smith’s Glo­ri­ous Three Hour Farewell to CBGB’s on Its Final Night\nThe Talk­ing Heads Play CBGB, the New York Club That Shaped Their Sound (1975)\nWatch an Episode of TV-CBGB, the First Rock ‘n’ Roll Sit­com Ever Aired on Cable TV (1981)\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThrough dense thickets of florals rendered in watercolor and colored pencil, a woman attempts to find her footing. Enmeshed in vines and leaves, this nude protagonist can be seen cradling a child or tending to another matter, her surroundings obscuring the particulars of her body and actions.\nThese vibrant works are part of a semi-autobiographical series by Sarah Ann Weber, who marks two momentous occasions: the birth of her daughter and her move from Los Angeles, where she lived for a decade, to her hometown of Chicago. Titled I Know Her, this body of work refers to the artist herself, her child, and the stark differences between the two landscapes. \n“Wake up bright” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper mounted to linen over panel, 36 x 48 inches\nWeber explores these significant changes through works teeming with growth. Whereas Los Angeles is dry and warm much of the year, Chicago cycles through all four seasons, sometimes seemingly within the same week. Contrasts between these locales arise through bright, tropical palettes alongside muted, winter fields in shades of gray and blue.\nWithin these lush atmospheres, splotches of watercolor and vivid florals subsume any definitive boundaries. Drawing on the traditions of window paintings and portraits depicting mother and child, the artist nests architectural structures and tender, familial moments within her largely botanical scenes. All seem to acquiesce to the rapidly evolving environment, nodding to the inevitability of change and renewal inside and out.\nI Know Her runs through January 10 at Anat Ebgi Gallery in Los Angeles.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nUpon entering Cannupa Hanska Luger’s new exhibition, Dripping Earth at the Joslyn Art Museum, visitors find themselves, in a sense, underwater. Frames of bull boats sail overhead, referencing the small vessels that some Plains tribes historically used and orienting us within the context of the Joslyn’s location in Omaha along the Missouri River, the museum’s art collection, and Luger’s Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, and Lakota lineage.\nLuger is known for his interdisciplinary explorations of his Northern Plains ancestry through clay, sculpture, performance, textiles, video, and more. For Dripping Earth, the artist took inspiration from a source with a close connection to both the Joslyn’s holdings and his own observations of art in his youth: the work of Swiss artist Karl Bodmer (1809–1893).\n“Thunder as Remarkable Landscape” (2025) from the series ‘Future Ancestral Technologies,’ eight-color lithograph, edition of 7, sheet: 38 x 26 inches. Photo by Wendy McEahern, courtesy of the artist and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York\nBetween 1832 and 1834, Bodmer accompanied German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied on a North American expedition. Bodmer served as official documentarian, visually detailing the landscapes and people they encountered in numerous drawings and watercolors, many of which were later reproduced in Europe as lithographs. His portraits, which often emphasize ceremonial regalia, are a valuable record of Indigenous American tribal identity during this time.\nDrawn to the nature of artifacts—how, for instance, Bodmer’s work can become an artifact of an artifact within the context of printmaking and reproductions—Luger considers how narratives are both conveyed and received. When Bodmer’s paintings were translated into lithographs in the 19th century, the printmakers took liberties with “correcting” some of what they viewed as mistakes or incompletions, changing anatomical anomalies or missing details. But in some cases, these corrections weren’t actually a reflection of reality, which the original watercolors reveal.\nLuger is interested in how, over time, what is set into print becomes fixed, sometimes misconstrued, and inflexible. On the other hand, oral traditions like those of Northern Plains tribes are always evolving. For Dripping Earth, the artist focuses on this fluidity within the broader context of how American history is told.\n“As a Native person growing up in North America, you go to school, you learn the history of the country, and you have a contrary story,” the artist said during an opening talk for Dripping Earth. His ongoing series Future Ancestral Technologies is a way of collapsing time—of bringing both the past and the future together in a way that addresses how Indigenous American material and visual culture has been shown in museums—as something ancient, primitive, and dark, when in fact it is ever-present and always evolving.\n“Midéegaadi – Light” (2022) from the series ‘Future Ancestral Technologies,’ mixed-media bison regalia, installation dimensions variable. © Cannupa Hanska Luger. Photo by Brandon Soder, courtesy of the artist and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York\nFor this show, Luger scaled up, making some of his largest work to date. A monumental figure of steel and black clay looms over a number of ceramic vessels, carved wooden objects, and multi-media installations. A socially engaged work comprising steel poles with handmade clay beads also evokes a giant, three-dimensional abacus in the shape of a buffalo, illustrating data of wild buffalo returning to the plains. A few workshops facilitated by the museum invite visitors to create their own clay beads, which are then added to the sculpture to complete the animal’s form over time.\nCentral to Dripping Earth are a number of dancers sporting crocheted fabrics, padded gloves, and headdresses evocative of bison. These comprise Luger’s Midéegaadi series, the title of which is derived from the Hidatsa word for buffalo. A new group of limited-run prints combine these colorful figures—complete with Ben-Day dots that nod to the act of printmaking itself—with landscapes Bodmer sketched around the Missouri River region. \nInterestingly, although Bodmer made landscape paintings, too, the backgrounds of his portraits are typically left blank. Luger delves into how most 19th-century landscape painting of so-called “virgin territory” simply left out the presence of the Indigenous people who already lived there. “Oh, but we were there!” Luger says. Bodmer’s paintings are almost like the landscapes in reverse, with emphasis only on people. For a new series of Midéegaadi prints, Luger incorporates Bodmer’s landscapes into the background.\nNotably, many of the landforms the Swiss artist chronicled are now submerged in the Missouri River following the construction of major dams. But Luger considers this to be a part of a bigger story, in which these land forms—created by the river—weren’t “lost” but instead reclaimed by it. Which brings us again to how we approach Luger’s show, as though moving through a timeless, watery realm representative of the past, present, and future all at once—a speculative future that brims with the past.\nKarl Bodmer, “Leader of the Mandan Beróck-Óchatä,” watercolor and graphite on paper, 17 × 11 15/16 inches.

White (2019)\nLuger’s Midéegaadi dancers have made a number of appearances throughout 2025, including a large-scale installation for Times Square’s nightly Midnight Moment public art program. The video work took over more than 90 giant LED screens in the Manhattan intersection throughout the month of April, running for three minutes starting at 11:57 p.m.\nLast month, one character called “Midéegaadi – Fire” also debuted in an unsanctioned digital group exhibition called ENCODED in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s American Wing, during which the figure danced across Thomas Cole’s 1836–37 painting “View on the Catskills – Early Autumn” in an augmented reality performance.\nDripping Earth continues through March 8, 2026, in Omaha. And ENCODED runs through December 21 in New York City.

Photo: Olympia Shannon)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nUman’s practice is interdisciplinary and ever-evolving. Comprising painting, drawing, murals, mosaic, sculpture, and glass, her work is rooted in the tangibility of color and the transportive power of images. Shaped by memories, dreams, and the constant flux of life around her, Uman’s visual language is intuitive and multilayered, adaptable and free; it is neither exclusively abstract nor metaphorical — it grows out of what is indeterminate and into the transcendent. Her many inspirations range broadly, from her childhood in East Africa and diasporic experiences in Europe and the US to a love for textiles and transcontinental fashion. Her subject matter evokes the flamboyant fabrics worn by women in Somali bazaars, the slanted flourishes of Arabic calligraphy taught in madrasas, and the vast countryside of Kenya and Upstate New York.\nOn view at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, through May 10, 2026, Uman: After all the things … includes new and recent paintings, works on paper, video, and a sculpture. Created with oil, acrylic, spray paint, oil stick, and even sometimes incorporating elements of collage and sewing as well, Uman’s compositions dance with animated hues and phantasmagoric patterns. Working on many pieces simultaneously, Uman builds her pictorial arrangements — many of which reference 19th-century French painting, surrealism, and visionary abstraction alongside the natural world — with energetic mark-making methods, using dry brushes and even her fingers and palms, resulting in surface treatments that disrupt the conventional distinction between paintings and drawing. Fusing art history with autobiography and spirituality with reality, Uman’s work pursues the metaphorical through a close attention to, and reverence for, the natural world.\nUman: After all the things … is accompanied by the artist’s first museum publication, co-published by Gregory R. Miller & Co., featuring an essay by the curator, images of the work on view, and installation images.\nFor more information, visit thealdrich.org.\nUman: After all the things … is organized by Amy Smith-Stewart, Diana Bowes Chief Curator.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStriking union members on the picket line at the staff entrance of the Tate Modern on August 18, 2020 (photo by Guy Smallman/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nMonths after the Tate Museums in England cut 7% of their workforce, citing a post-pandemic slump, workers have vowed to go on strike for a week starting November 26.\nMore than 150 workers at Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool, and Tate St. Ives plan to strike over wages, citing “below-inflationary” pay raise offers over the last two years, a union spokesperson told Hyperallergic. \nThe striking staff members belong to Tate Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS Tate United), one of the three unions representing museum employees. In a ballot held on November 11, 98% of union staff members voted in favor of striking. The move comes after the museum cut a reported 40 jobs in March, attributing the downsizing to pandemic-related deficits. The strike is expected to end on December 2.\nThe union said in a press release that based on a recent survey, 72.2% of its members could not afford basic living costs with their salaries. The BBC reported this week that prices rose by 3.8% in the United Kingdom in 2025.\nA union spokesperson rebuked the museum’s 2% pay raise offer for 2024, which was later increased to 3% for 2025–2026. According to PCS Tate United, the pay raise offer “does not address ongoing issues of low pay at the institution.”\nThe union also said in a press release that the job cuts earlier this year led to the closure of a subsidized dining hall for staff.\n“The dispute is primarily focused on pay, with the last two years seeing below-inflationary offers,” a union spokesperson told Hyperallergic in an email. “This is in addition to a sustained period of cutbacks and restructures, with a series of voluntary redundancies, the closure of the subsidised staff canteen and the redundancies of some of the canteen staff.”\nIn response to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment, a Tate spokesperson said directors at the museum were not offered salary increases this year as part of institutional attempts to maintain a “balanced budget,” and added that the offer of a 3% pay increase was accepted by Tate’s other two unions.\n“Tate has made careful savings this year in order to invest in staff pay and still achieve a balanced budget,” the spokesperson said. “It is only by creating and maintaining a sustainable financial model that we can continue to invest in our staff in the long term.”\nWorkers previously went on strike in 2020, when the museum announced it intended to cut 313 jobs, or about half of its workforce.\n“With many Tate directors receiving six-figure pay packages and five-figure bonuses while staff are condemned to in-work poverty, it is no wonder we have seen such an overwhelming vote for strike action,” PCS General Secretary Fran Heathcote said in a statement. “Our members have rightly rejected another insulting pay offer from senior Tate management, and now stand ready to take strike action that will severely impact gallery operations.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn a world this absurd and disastrous, do we gravitate toward cynicism or levity? For the artist duo known as Murmure (previously), both are the only option.\nThe Caen, France-based pair presents a new body of paintings and charcoal drawings in their plainly titled exhibition, La fête est finie, or The party is over. Through a unique sense of wit and irony, they transform astronauts into runway models, the moon into a nuclear power plant, and a birthday cake into a raging forest fire. \n“Moon Walk” (2025), carbon pencil on paper, 50 x 40 centimeters\nWhere there could be commonplace sights or moments of joy and frivolity, Murmure instead presents an unsettling composition. Every ill-advised choice—whether baking in front of a UV screen or watching cows graze on an ice floe—becomes a spectacular confrontation with our collective obsessions with consumerism, ecological wreckage, and self-serving gluttony.\nLa fête est finie is on view through November 22 at Galerie LJ in Paris. Find more from the artists on their website and Instagram.\n“UV #2” (2025), carbon pencil on paper, 35 x 35 centimeters\n“Nuclear Moon” (2025), carbon pencil on paper, 50 x 70 centimeters\n“A Mushroom Story” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 200 x 150 centimeters\n“Happy Birthday” (2025), carbon pencil on paper, 55 x 40 centimeters\n“UV #1” (2025), carbon pencil on paper, 180 x 130 centimeters\n“Cooler Age” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 50 x 70 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t"

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for his squishy flowers and foliage made of polyurethane-coated fabrics, often encased-slash-smushed behind panels of clear acrylic, Ant Hamlyn has a sense of humor when it comes to art history.\nNodding to genres in Western art like vanitas still-life paintings, he creates textile reliefs that tap into our contemporary condition. From fast food to houseplants to a vibrant bar cart, his compositions playfully explore themes of indulgence, impermanence, beauty, and the quotidian.\n“Greasy Spoon”\nUntil recently, Hamlyn has focused predominantly on cartoonish botanicals, and he now delves further into the still-life genre. Works like “Greasy Spoon,” “Shelf Life,” and “Drive-Thru” incorporate motifs of food and trendy home decor evocative of quirky snapshots one might see on Instagram, with people just out of frame.\nThe works seen here were recently presented by Moosey, and you can find more of Hamlyn’s work on his website and Instagram.\n“Potwash (I Ought to Give You a Lesson in How to Clean Tables, Boy!”\n“Drive-Thru”\n“Berry and Rye”\n“Shelf Life”\n“Soft Vanitas”\n“Megadeal”\n“Houseplant”\n\t\n\t\n\t"

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the famous first stanza of the 17th-century poem “Auguries of Innocence,” William Blake writes:\n\nTo see a world in a grain of sandAnd a heaven in a wild flower,Hold infinity in the palm of your handAnd eternity in an hour.\n\nPerhaps Blake didn’t intend us to literally hold infinity in our hands, but he may have been aware that there was, in a manner of speaking, a way to don the entire known universe.\nPhoto by Ulf Bruxe, Historical Museum/SHM\nCombining the elegance of gold jewelry with the meticulous craftsmanship of intricate timepieces, a unique style of ring emerged from a fashion for the cosmos during the 16th and 17th centuries. Known as armillary rings, these deceptively simple gold creations can be worn on the finger like any other band, but when removed, they open up into a sphere made of several interconnecting circular bands operated by delicate hinges.\nExamples of armillary rings in the British Museum and the Swedish National Museums of History have been traced to Germany, made during the Late Renaissance as the study of astronomy reached new heights. In 1543, Copernicus essentially launched the scientific revolution when he claimed that the Earth rotates around the Sun, not the other way around.\nA few years later, Italian polymath Galileo Galilei, known as a pioneer of observational astronomy, built a telescope powerful enough to, for the first time, observe the stars of the Milky Way, see Jupiter’s four largest satellites, and make out Saturn’s rings, among other discoveries.\nThe historic gold rings are based on ancient astronomical instruments called armillary spheres, which emerged from the long-disproven theory that everything in the cosmos revolved around Earth. The designs, which were used since at least the 2nd century, place our planet at the center. A group of rings rotates on an axis, providing reference points for locating other celestial bodies. Separate bands correlate to the equator, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the revolution of the Sun—a ring which also represents the constellations of the Zodiac.\nPhoto by Nina Davis, Historical Museum/SHM\nPhoto by Helena Bonnevier, Historical Museum/SHM\nImage © The Trustees of the British Museum\nImage © The Trustees of the British Museum\nPhoto by Helena Bonnevier, Historical Museum/SHM\n\t\n\t\n\t"

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“Street photography is a way of life,” Jamel Shabazz says, a sentiment he’s embodied and shared with the public for the past half century. The legendary photographer is best known for documenting the style, culture, and political landscape of his native Brooklyn from the 1980s onward, part of which is now collected in a new book published by Prestel.\nProspect Park: Photographs of a Brooklyn Oasis, 1980 to 2025 contains 120 color and black-and-white images captured within the urban enclave. At 585 acres, the public park offers a vast area for gathering, exercising, and engaging with nature, and for Shabazz, it’s always been a refuge from life’s realities.\nProspect Park, 1995, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nHe began taking the photos in this collection after returning to New York following a 36-month service in the U.S. Army and while he worked for the Department of Corrections at the notorious Riker’s Island facility. For Shabazz, Prospect Park became a site of joy and community and a small escape from these everyday horrors.\nIncluded in the monograph are several portraits that show what a fixture the photographer has been in the park. Warm, easy smiles and confident poses abound, and while the popular fashions and technology may change, so much of life depicted stays the same. The images glimpse how vital the outdoor space has remained over the years, as several generations climb trees, gather to look out over one of the lakes, or simply find joy in each other’s company.\nFind more of Shabazz’s archive on Instagram, and pick up a copy of Prospect Park on Bookshop.\nProspect Park, 1981, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nJamel Shabazz’s father at Prospect Park, 1990, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2010, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2014, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 1982, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2012, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2012, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nJamel Shabazz, © Michael McCoy, 2016\nImage © Prestel / Jamel Shabazz, 2025\n\t\n\t\n\t"

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Philadelphia Museum of Art is now the Philadelphia Art Museum with a new brand identity and logo. (photo by Rob Cusick, courtesy the museum)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nSay goodbye to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and hello to … hold onto your hats … the Philadelphia Art Museum! *crickets*\nOn Wednesday, October 8, the historic arts institution announced a major overhaul of its brand, including a new logo with a serif typeface and a slightly slimmer name that has some nodding in approval and others scratching their heads. It’s the latest museum rebranding to cause a public stir, following controversial campaigns by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Brooklyn Museum over the past decade. \nFor those outside of Philly, the redesign may not seem like a significant change (after all, “Philadelphia Museum of Art” and “Philadelphia Art Museum” are both big mouthfuls). But for local residents, many of whom already knew the institution as simply “the Art Museum,” it may come as a natural step.\n“When I mention to folks who aren’t engaged in the arts and culture community and I say the PMA, they have no idea what I’m talking about,” the museum’s director and chief executive officer Sasha Suda told public radio station WHYY-FM. Under its new name, the museum now takes on the George Michael-esque acronym, “PhAM” (hold the exclamation point), which has already been incorporated into the URL of its redesigned website.\nNot everyone is as enthusiastic about the change. “The #phart museum? You gotta be kidding me!” quipped costume designer Rita Squitiere on X. “We had no problem calling it the Philadelphia Museum of Art … We’re smart people, we can handle words.”\nWhile some have welcomed the rebranding, others have voiced criticism of the new design. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via @philamuseum on Instagram)\nFor the brand redesign, the museum worked with Brooklyn-based design studio Gretel, whose clients include the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas. Its portfolio also lists the New York City Football Club as a previous customer, which will not be surprising to critics who took issue with PhAM’s new logo depicting the museum’s longstanding symbolic griffin.\n“It looks like a soccer team logo,” wrote one user above a congratulatory comment from the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, on Instagram. The sentiment was echoed by art media outlet The Arts District in a post claiming that the logo resembled an athleisure ad campaign.\n“It feels both oppressive and bland, not like the charming treasure trove that is PMA’s collection,” commented artist and filmmaker Lex Brown on Instagram. \nSome also lambasted the museum for hiring a NYC design firm as opposed to a company rooted in Philadelphia. “For a museum filled with so much beautiful and creative art, they really approached this branding shift with the energy and thought process of a NYC design agency working with a soon-to-be-open Fishtown coffee shop,” fumed artist Rushawn Stanley on Instagram.\n\"It's been rebranded as the PMA!\"\"A Brooklyn design firm has rebranded it's logo as a lion's crest\"\"We're not your grandfather's museum\"\"We're digital-first\" pic.twitter.com/inguT0LpyS— Michael (@phillymike223) October 8, 2025\nGreg Hahn, founder of Gretel, told Hyperallergic that the company sees the public’s reactions to the museum’s redesign as “a strong response to changing things that they have grown to love.”\n“Any brand (person, place, or thing) develops an audience, and if they’re lucky, a following. When that’s the case, there will always be opinions on any changes made, sometimes founded and sometimes simply reactionary,” Hahn said.\nStill others opined that the brand’s new custom typeface, a font known as Fairmount Serif, appeared too dystopian. (Gretel noted in its announcement that the type pulls from the museum’s origins as the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Arts, as well as architectural details like its original seal and wall engravings.)\n“The logo looks like some kind of Cold War monstrosity,” said illustrator Bonnie Watts, citing the institution’s recent disputes with its staff union. In June 2023, unionized workers accused leadership of backtracking on agreed-upon provisions for longevity pay. The allegations were made not even a year after workers held a 19-day strike in demand of wage increases, paid family leave, and more affordable healthcare.\n“Do better for the people who actually make a difference at the museum,” Watts said on Instagram. “Then maybe people will actually want to visit.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaya Pontone (she/her) is a Staff News Writer at Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThis fall, Philadelphia’s leading progressive art studio, the Center for Creative Works (CCW), has partnered with Haverford College’s Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery to present LOOK HERE, a dynamic, multisensory exhibition illuminating the nuanced and revelatory perspectives represented in the work of neurodivergent artists. Ranging from colorful illustrations that meticulously catalogue differences in categories of food, transit, and appliances, to found object sculptures that form relics of a world understood through touch, the show invites visitors to look, listen, smell, and touch to connect with a diversity of ways of “looking” at the world.\nLOOK HERE features six artists with studio practices based out of CCW – Kelly Brown, Cindy Gosselin, Clyde Henry, Tim Quinn, Brandon Spicer-Crawley, and Allen Yu. Curated by Jennifer Gilbert alongside two CCW artists  — Mary T. Bevlock and Paige Donovan — the exhibition emphasizes art’s ability to communicate across different sensory channels.\nThe show’s design integrates many elements to enhance accessibility for a variety of audiences, including braille, videos about the artists with American Sign Language (ASL) embedded, touch panels featuring artists’ materials, sensory backpacks, an Easy Read guide, a quiet room, and tours led by neurodivergent artists.\nLOOK HERE is complemented by a series of related events, including two satellite exhibitions – one at Haverford’s VCAM gallery, LOOK THERE, featuring a single work from a larger group of 99 CCW artists, and another at Philadelphia’s Atelier Gallery through October, LOOK EVERYWHERE, which highlights works from 33 artists from 30 progressive art studios around the United States. \nThese exhibitions will coincide with the sixth annual Creating Community Symposium, happening October 20–23. Originally founded by California’s Creative Growth Art Center, the symposium brings together professionals from progressive art studios around the US to discuss best practices, advocacy, and the evolving intersection of art and disability. This is the first time the gathering will be held on the East Coast.\nLOOK HERE and LOOK THERE are open through December 13, 2025. LOOK EVERYWHERE closes on October 31.\nTo learn more, visit hav.to/lookhere.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t"

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tNovember 24th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nNew York isn’t the old­est city in the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca, and it cer­tain­ly isn’t the newest. But it is, quite pos­si­bly, the Amer­i­can city where more lay­ers of his­to­ry coex­ist than any oth­er, a qual­i­ty that man­i­fests most vivid­ly in its built envi­ron­ment. Even the most casu­al tourist can sense the sheer vari­ety of time peri­ods embod­ied in the build­ings around them on, say, a stroll down Broad­way — one of the streets fea­tured in the ten-part walk­ing tour com­piled in the new Archi­tec­tur­al Digest video above. As a whole, it offers a two-hour jour­ney through the city begin­ning in Cen­tral Park and end­ing on Wall Street.\nIn between come on-foot exam­i­na­tions of every­thing from the fin-de-siè­cle “apart­ment hotels” of the Upper West Side to the recent­ly built “super-tall” res­i­den­tial tow­ers of West 57th Street to the devel­op­ments atop the buried Grand Cen­tral Sta­tion to the dis­used indus­tri­al rail­way now known — and imi­tat­ed around the world — as a lin­ear park called the High Line. \nTend though long­time New York­ers may to regard each part of the city as more or less a nation unto itself, a per­spec­tive with a bit more dis­tance reveals signs of the nev­er-end­ing social, eco­nom­ic, and aes­thet­ic exchange between them: an impor­tant fac­tor in how the use of and role played by even the city’s most august struc­tures has been sub­ject to change after unan­tic­i­pat­ed change.\nHelp­ing us to under­stand all this are archi­tects Michael Wyet­zn­er and Nick Potts, both pro­fes­sion­al­ly well placed to explain both the big pic­ture of New York’s evo­lu­tion and the sig­nif­i­cance of the var­i­ous odd­i­ties and eccen­tric­i­ties on its streets. Even an archi­tec­tur­al lay­man would take impressed notice while pass­ing, say, the man­sions once inhab­it­ed by Alexan­der Hamil­ton and Aaron Burr; the jagged bunker that has housed the Whit­ney Muse­um of Amer­i­can Art, the Met Breuer, and Frick Madi­son; the impos­si­bly skin­ny-look­ing sky­scrap­ers of the so-called “Bil­lion­aire’s Row”; or the Dako­ta, John Lennon’s final res­i­dence. But to learn what such build­ings have to tell us about the his­to­ry and nature of New York, we must look at them, as anoth­er famous rock star once sang, thru’ these archi­tects’ eyes.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Lost Neigh­bor­hood Buried Under New York City’s Cen­tral Park\nA Whirl­wind Archi­tec­tur­al Tour of the New York Pub­lic Library — “Hid­den Details” and All\nArchi­tect Breaks Down the Design Of Four Icon­ic New York City Muse­ums: the Met, MoMA, Guggen­heim & Frick\nEvery Hid­den Detail of New York’s Clas­sic Sky­scrap­ers: The Chrysler, Empire State & Wool­worth Build­ings\nA Walk­ing Tour of Los Ange­les Archi­tec­ture: From Art Deco to Cal­i­for­nia Bun­ga­low\nA 5‑Hour Walk­ing Tour of Paris and Its Famous Streets, Mon­u­ments & Parks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImages cour­tesy of the Library of Con­gress.\nActor George Takei was once best known as Star Trek’s Mr. Sulu. He still is, of course, but over the last cou­ple decades his friend­ly, intel­li­gent, and wicked­ly fun­ny pres­ence on social media has land­ed him a new pop­u­lar role as a civ­il lib­er­ties advo­cate. Takei’s activist pas­sion is informed not only by his sta­tus as a gay man, but also by his child­hood expe­ri­ences. At the age of 5, Takei was round­ed up with his Amer­i­can-born par­ents and tak­en to a Japan­ese intern­ment camp in Arkansas, where he would live for the next three years. In an inter­view with Democ­ra­cy Now, Takei spoke frankly about this his­to­ry:\nWe’re Amer­i­cans…. We had noth­ing to do with the war. We sim­ply hap­pened to look like the peo­ple that bombed Pearl Har­bor. But with­out charges, with­out tri­al, with­out due process—the fun­da­men­tal pil­lar of our jus­tice system—we were sum­mar­i­ly round­ed up, all Japan­ese Amer­i­cans on the West Coast, where we were pri­mar­i­ly res­i­dent, and sent off to 10 barb wire intern­ment camps—prison camps, real­ly, with sen­try tow­ers, machine guns point­ed at us—in some of the most des­o­late places in this coun­try.\nTakei and his fam­i­ly were among over 100,000 Japanese-Americans—over half of whom were U.S. cit­i­zens—interned in such camps.\n\nInto one of these camps, Man­za­nar, locat­ed in the foothills of the Sier­ra Nevadas, cel­e­brat­ed pho­tog­ra­ph­er Ansel Adams man­aged to gain entrance through his friend­ship with the war­den. Adams took over 200 pho­tographs of life inside the camp.\nIn 1965, he donat­ed his col­lec­tion to the Library of Con­gress, writ­ing in a let­ter, “The pur­pose of my work was to show how these peo­ple, suf­fer­ing under a great injus­tice, and loss of prop­er­ty, busi­ness and pro­fes­sions, had over­come the sense of defeat and dis­pair [sic] by build­ing for them­selves a vital com­mu­ni­ty in an arid (but mag­nif­i­cent) envi­ron­ment.”\n\nAdams had anoth­er pur­pose as well—as schol­ar of the peri­od Frank H. Wu describes it—“to doc­u­ment some aspects of the intern­ment camp that the gov­ern­ment didn’t want to have shown.” These include “the barbed wire, and the guard tow­ers, and the armed sol­diers.” Pro­hib­it­ed from doc­u­ment­ing these con­trol mech­a­nisms direct­ly, the pho­tog­ra­ph­er “cap­tured them in the back­ground, in shad­ows,” says Wu: “In some of the pho­tos when you look you can see just faint­ly that he’s tak­ing a pho­to of some­thing, but in front of the pho­to you can see barbed wire, or on the ground you can see the shad­ow of barbed wire. Some of the pho­tos even show the blur­ry out­line of a soldier’s shad­ow.”\n\nThe pho­tographs doc­u­ment the dai­ly activ­i­ties of the internees—their work and leisure rou­tines, and their strug­gles to main­tain some sem­blance of nor­mal­cy while liv­ing in hasti­ly con­struct­ed bar­racks in the harsh­est of con­di­tions.\n\nThough the land­scape, and its cli­mate, could be des­o­late and unfor­giv­ing, it was also, as Adams couldn’t help but notice, “mag­nif­i­cent.” The col­lec­tion includes sev­er­al wide shots of stretch­es of moun­tain range and sky, often with pris­on­ers star­ing off long­ing­ly into the dis­tance. But the major­i­ty of the pho­tos are of the internees—men, women, and chil­dren, often in close-up por­traits that show them look­ing var­i­ous­ly hope­ful, hap­py, sad­dened, and resigned.\n\nYou can view the entire col­lec­tion at the Library of Con­gress’ online cat­a­log. Adams also pub­lished about 65 of the pho­tographs in a book titled Born Free and Equal: The Sto­ry of Loy­al Japan­ese Amer­i­cans in 1944. The col­lec­tion rep­re­sents an impor­tant part of Adams’ work dur­ing the peri­od. But more impor­tant­ly, it rep­re­sents events in U.S. his­to­ry that should nev­er be for­got­ten or denied.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Dis­ney Fought Fas­cism with Pro­pa­gan­da Car­toons Dur­ing World War II & Avert­ed Finan­cial Col­lapse\nDr. Seuss’ World War II Pro­pa­gan­da Films: Your Job in Ger­many (1945) and Our Job in Japan (1946)\nAnsel Adams Reveals His Cre­ative Process in 1958 Doc­u­men­tary\nDis­cov­er Ansel Adams’ 226 Pho­tos of U.S. Nation­al Parks (and Anoth­er Side of the Leg­endary Pho­tog­ra­ph­er)\nDr. Seuss Draws Anti-Japan­ese Car­toons Dur­ing WWII, Then Atones with Hor­ton Hears a Who!\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCombining hand-carved Japanese cypress with crystal-clear acrylic resin, Ayako Kita sculpts tender, emotive figures. For her current exhibition, The End of the Day Begins at FUMA Contemporary Tokyo, she focuses on the transitional moment of returning home, in which seemingly mundane tasks like switching on a light or opening a curtain are imbued with consequence, frozen in time.\nKita’s work emphasizes an often introspective world, where a young woman or girl’s consciousness, emotions, and anxieties manifest in uncanny scenarios. The titles usually offer important clues, too. In “me & me,” for example, an extra pair of legs is literally tethered to the character’s own limbs, as if another half-formed parallel version of her person is always present. And change is in the air in “Premonition,” where a slightly apprehensive expression is accompanied by a gust of wind.\n“Premonition” (2022), Japanese cypress and acrylic resin, 29 x 17 x 11 centimeters\nIn her most recent work, the figures exhibit expressions of curiosity, thoughtfulness, and faint concern, gazing directly at the viewer, as if seeing us unexpectedly across a room or out a window. “When I began to think about creating a world in which all the pieces would connect as one continuous story, this series naturally came to mind,” Kita says in a statement.\nThe End of the Day Begins includes works the artist has made throughout the past five years. Her newest pieces combine figures with furnishings and architectural elements, a theme she first explored when she was a student. “Rather than a return to my origins, this production became a time to reaffirm that these scenes still exist vividly within me,” she says.\nThe End of the Day Begins continues through November 29 in Tokyo.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetail of Elvira Clayton, \"Indigo Bess and Her Children\" (2024), six sculptures: indigo-dyed osnaburg, cotton, wire, jute, sequins, mini glass bottles, cotton bolls, shells, twigs, screen-printed archival text and photographs, embroidery hoops, acrylic, handwoven, and crochet (all photos Lisa Yin Zhang/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nHistory isn’t made in stirring individual moments — an election, speech, or protest — just remembered by them. An Incomplete Haunting, an exhibition at 601Artspace curated by Rachel Raphaela Gugelberger, is part of Fall of Freedom, a decentralized series of events across the United States on November 21 and 22 opposing growing authoritarianism and censorship. Three of its 14 artists and collectives — Kris Grey, Miguel Luciano, and Dread Scott — co-organized Fall of Freedom and are listed as initiators of the exhibition. But curator Gugelberger submitted the curatorial proposal for An Incomplete Haunting two years ago, before Trump’s reelection. Indeed, its themes — that we are the ghosts of history, products of systems and decisions that continue to reverberate — suggest ideas that have long been percolating in the ether as the country barrels toward fascism. But in an increasingly numbed world, where atrocities are scrolled past and claims about power and resistance are further leeched of meaning with each successive repetition, the exhibition’s greatest success is in making those ideas viscerally and urgently present. \nThis exhibition trades in art’s auratic power; its objects assert the power of collective memory. Kenneth Tam’s “Why Do You Abuse Me” (2022) consists of the earth from sites along the Transcontinental Railroad, where many Chinese laborers died amid perilous working conditions and low wages in the 1860s. Embedded with dried fruits, seeds, mushrooms, and other sources of physical and spiritual nourishment, and standing almost preternaturally erect on one coin-edge to block your path, the piece feels almost alive. Meanwhile, Kris Grey’s “Capital T” (2025) consists of weathered wooden beams that I initially read as a crucifix; I could feel their weariness, the burden of persecution. Only upon reading the curatorial essay did I learn that it was salvaged from the dance floor of the original Stonewall Inn, the site of one of the most pivotal rebellions in queer history. Suddenly, an event I’d encountered only through repeated historical reference was startlingly, physically present. \nInstallation view of Kenneth Tam, “Why Do You Abuse Me” (2022), epoxy resin, dirt, sand, dried mushrooms, dried seaweed, dried bamboo shoots, dried jujube, dried goji berries, preserved apricots, sunflower seeds, dried roots, dried sweet potato, and steel\nOne notable — and slightly unusual — emphasis in this show is on recreations and reenactments, suggesting that there are more impactful ways to tell the truth than simply recounting what happened and offering another channel to feel history in the now. The late Nona Faustine’s “Dorothy Angola, Stay Free, In Land of the Blacks, Minetta Lane, the Village, NYC” (2021), for instance, brings the deeply buried history of one of the first enslaved women trafficked here by the Dutch West India Company in the 1600s back to the fore by embodying her ghost: Faustine stands in the center of a former semi-free Black settlement in all white, looking straight into the camera. Mark Tribe’s Port Huron Project (2006–8) documents reenactments of iconic protest speeches on location; hearing the same words spoken in the same space, you feel the presence of past audiences and part of the same movement as them — a thread continued by Andrea Ray’s “The Sound of Women’s Rights” (2020/25), which interweaves voices from the 1970s with those of the past decade. \nThat may be An Incomplete Haunting and Fall of Freedom’s most important act: bringing us together to feel history as a shared, living force, and refusing to let that feeling dissipate when we leave.\n\nInstallation view of An Incomplete Haunting\n\nInstallation view of An Incomplete Haunting\n\nKris Grey, “Capital T” (2025), salvaged wooden joists from Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center\n\nInstallation view of An Incomplete Haunting\n\nMark Tribe, “The Liberation of Our People: Angela Davis” (1969/2008)\n\nInstallation view of Andrea Ray, “The Sound of Women’s Rights” (2020/2025), stoneware with glaze, steel with finish, speaker, audio equipment, 5-minute audio on loop\nAn Incomplete Haunting continues at 601Artspace (88 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, Manhattan) through February 22, 2026.

    "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO — In an unassuming back room in the Catherine Clark Gallery in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, among stored canvases, sits a 2,000-pound replica of the White House. Step closer, and you’ll notice the unmistakable cylindrical form of a bullet, and then of many, many bullets.\nThe rust-colored replica, over six feet wide, was made in 2018 from repurposed bullets, gun parts, shell casings, and glass by sculptor Al Farrow, based in San Rafael, a town about 20 minutes north of San Francisco. “White House” is priced at $500,000 and is on view indefinitely at the Catherine Clark Gallery, years after its creation and museum tour, reappearing to the public in time for the Fall of Freedom series of nationwide art and protest actions this weekend. The artist spoke at the gallery on Friday, November 21, during a special viewing, one of hundreds of cultural events across the country opposing authoritarianism.\nIn a phone interview with Hyperallergic, Farrow said he felt the work took on a renewed significance under the second Trump administration.\n“Trump got elected and I just said, ‘Look, I think the White House is more relevant now than when I made it, and it’s more relevant than anything else I have to show,’” Farrow recalled of his conversation with his gallerist when they decided to display the work again.\nThe work is on view indefinitely in a room at the Catherine Clark Gallery\nFarrow said the idea first occurred to him during George W. Bush’s presidency, but when Barack Obama was elected in 2008, he stopped planning the work, citing a feeling of hope. Nearly a decade later, when Trump was elected in 2016, he picked it back up. \nThe recreation of the White House marks a thematic departure from many of Farrow’s other sculptures, which include models of synagogues, mosques, and Christian churches comprised of munitions.\nIn these religious architectural renderings, Farrow critiques a hypocritical connection between religion and violence. Farrow, who comes from a Jewish background and describes himself as an atheist, has been critical of Israel’s violence against Palestinians in Gaza and has included Uzi guns, a weapon once used by the Israeli military, in his works. His cathedral sculpture “The Spine and Tooth of Santo Guerro” (2008), titled after a fictional saint, is also comprised of gun parts and bullets and resides in the collection of San Francisco’s de Young Museum.\n\nRear view of White House\nIn the 2000s, though, Farrow wanted to move away from religious iconography. Farrow said “White House” was one of his original secular concepts, and also the largest sculpture he’s made since he got his start in the 1970s.\nRather than scaling the work based on the White House, Farrow based the dimensions of his presidential residence on the barrels of machine guns, 18 of which he used to create columns.\n“I am not a shooter. I don’t own guns. I don’t shoot for hobby or hunt or and I was never in the military. I’ve always been the social commentary artist,” Farrow said of his relationship to his medium of choice. Under Trump’s second presidency, restrictions on who can buy a gun, including those who have active arrest warrants, have eased.\nHis first works featuring gun parts were inspired by Catholic reliquaries, containers for relics that were sometimes fashioned into the form of body parts to store remains of saints during the Middle Ages. \nFrom 1999 until earlier this year, it was illegal to purchase more than one firearm a month in California, per state law, but that prohibition was struck down in June of this year after a challenge from a pro-gun organization. When asked how he procured gun parts on a large scale, Farrow said he obtained them “a variety of ways,” and left it there.\n\nDetailed side-view shot of “White House”\nOriginally, his model of the White House was painted black, but Farrow decided to chemically rust the model to make it appear “corroded.”\n“And that rust, for me, is symbolic of the corrosion, the degeneration of the presidency in our system,” Farrow said.\nFarrow, who is in his mid-80s, said he has never seen this level of fear of artistic censorship in his decades-long career.\n“This is above and beyond anything that’s come before. We’re really facing a steep decline,” Farrow said. “I’m really thinking that it might be a really long time until things get back to good.”\nFarrow still spends six days a week working on his art, but has shifted his focus away from architecture. He finished a sculpture of a violin this week, based on Violins of Hope, a musical project that collects instruments owned by Jewish people before and during World War II. Farrow’s version comprises four handguns, and the neck of the instrument is a double-barreled shotgun in a critique comparing Israel’s actions in Gaza with the Holocaust.\n“I’m very aware that I don’t have that many years left,” Farrow said. “I’m just allowing myself total freedom to make anything that I’m looking at. My piles and piles of guns and gun parts and stuff.”\n\nA door comprised of gun parts\n\nFarrow said he intentionally chemically rusted the house to symbolize corrosion of demogracy.\n\nThe columns on the White House replica are made from machine gun barrels.\t",

Crumb has a new comic book! After a 23-year hiatus, Tales of Paranoia comes out this month, published by Fantagraphics, and the underground comic guru is exhibiting original drawings from the book at David Zwirner gallery.\nThe exhibition comprises original illustrated panels included in the comic book along with a few other recent drawings and excerpts from his sketchbooks. Now a widowed octogenarian based in France, his latest work demonstrates the same masterful rendering of his subjects, sans his prurient material. However, his witty humor, self-deprecation, paranoia, narcissism, anti-establishment commentary, and self-proclaimed neurosis — almost to a point of pride — have reached a new level of darkness. Clearly, he misses his wife and collaborator, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, who passed away in 2022. Her absence seems to have heightened his self-awareness and self-reflection. Left to his own devices, he explores his afflictions — and now mortality. “What does it all mean at this point in life?” he seems to muse.\n\nPage from R. Crumb, “What is Paranoia?” (2025) (© Robert Crumb, 2025, courtesy the artist, Paul Morris, and David Zwirner)\nA panel made in collaboration with Aline and their daughter, Sophie, “Crumb Family Covid Exposé” (2021), shows how the pandemic threw him into a tailspin, as he tunneled down a rabbit hole of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. He is an anti-vaxxer who deeply mistrusts the government and freaks out behind his wife’s back as she makes sure to get her vaccines. The two of them draw themselves in each panel from their own perspectives. \nIn “The Very Worst LSD I Ever Had” (2023) — one of the most disturbing stories — Crumb revisits a bad acid trip that has haunted him since it happened in 1966. What bothered him most about the experience was how it was blocked from his memory. Crumb was no stranger to psychedelics, but this trip left him paranoid. He and his first wife, Dana, had visited a house they heard was giving out the drug; after taking it, he became convinced that they were part of a science project. When Crumb explained his feelings to Peter Cornell, who doled out the drug, Cornell responded, “And now you’re going to die.” \nWith a long history in the comic world, Crumb caught national attention in the 1960s through his unique art. His crosshatching, done with his favorite tool, the Rapidograph pen, soon established his signature style, while album and book covers brought his work into mainstream pop culture, particularly the iconic 1968 Janis Joplin album Cheap Thrills.\nInstallation view of R. Crumb: Tales of Paranoia at David Zwirner, Los Angeles (photo Angel Xotlanihua, courtesy David Zwirner)\nCrumb’s work has long been embraced by the fine art world. This latest series of comics are now neatly matted and framed in Zwirner’s second gallery. To break up the monotony of the presentation, the back wall is painted a bright mustard yellow, with the title of the show, and a seating area is set up with a few of his books to peruse. (Too bad one can’t rip a drawing off the wall to sit with and read; standing for hours reading the comics can become challenging, if not straight-up tiring.)\nMany of Crumb’s personality traits don’t exactly match up: He’s liberal-minded but against vaccines; self-doubting but confident; a monogamist with a wandering eye. He is a mixed-up guy and is not afraid to put it all on display — perhaps for his own catharsis. In this new series he mainly concentrates on his paranoia with the vaccine and the political overseers, not trusting anyone. Two panels of “Conspiracy Theories!” (2025) are just text, spelling out the dire situation of today’s political climate. It’s difficult to get through the dense text, but a few gems stand out: “Large numbers of people now harbor suspicions that there was something phony or rigged about the whole pandemic narrative,” “What’s really going on?,” “Where does one turn for reliable sources of information,” and in big black block lettering, “QUESTION AUTHORITY.” One could easily walk away from this exhibition with a sense of doom.\nWhat is unusual about this new work, especially for me, is that I find myself sympathizing with him. The authenticity of his emotions — his feelings of helplessness and paranoia — can get to you. A cover line on his comic book, Tales of Paranoianstallation , says in a big yellow starburst, “Batshit Crazy or True Persception — Who Can Tell?” That pretty much sums it up. Welcome to Crumb’s world of 2025 — it’s not a pretty picture.\n\nPage from R.

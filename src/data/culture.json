    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tDecember 5th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt would be impos­si­ble to under­stand West­ern civ­i­liza­tion with­out under­stand­ing the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ty. But in order to do that, it may serve us well to think of it as the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ties, plur­al. So sug­gests Hochela­ga cre­ator Tom­mie Trelawny in the new video above, which explains the Gnos­tic Gospels, the “for­bid­den teach­ings of Jesus.” As a sys­tem of beliefs, Gnos­ti­cism is a fair­ly far cry from the main­stream forms of Chris­tian­i­ty with which most of us are famil­iar today. But its sur­viv­ing texts may sound uncan­ni­ly famil­iar, despite also involv­ing out­landish-sound­ing ele­ments that seem to belong to anoth­er civ­i­liza­tion entire­ly. Gnos­tic teach­ings have long been con­sid­ered heresy by Chris­tians, but do they real­ly rep­re­sent just a dif­fer­ent evo­lu­tion­ary branch of the faith: anoth­er Chris­tian­i­ty?\nReli­gious schol­ars of many stripes have con­cerned them­selves with few mat­ters as inten­sive­ly as they have with theod­i­cy, that is, the mat­ter of how to square the notion of a good, omnipo­tent deity with the obvi­ous exis­tence of evil down here in the world. Since its loose coali­tion of beliefs came togeth­er in the late first cen­tu­ry, Gnos­ti­cism has pro­posed an ele­gant solu­tion: that the deity is not, in fact, good, or rather, that under the tran­scen­dent, unknow­able God is a much more poor­ly behaved “demi­urge” who dis­plays an indif­fer­ence, at best, to the lot of human­i­ty. In this view, our result­ing world is less a per­fect cre­ation than a cos­mic mis­take — a propo­si­tion that would account for cer­tain of its qual­i­ties we expe­ri­ence on the day-to-day lev­el, even if we have no par­tic­u­lar reli­gious pro­cliv­i­ties.\nThanks to the dis­cov­ery of Egyp­t’s Nag Ham­ma­di library in 1945, we can direct­ly access many of the teach­ings of the so-called “Gnos­tic Gospels.” They tell us, to make a few grand sim­pli­fi­ca­tions, that our real­i­ty is illu­so­ry and that we can only come to grasp the true nature of both it and our­selves through eso­teric learn­ing, gno­sis being the ancient Greek term for knowl­edge. This world­view may bring to mind that of cer­tain Greek philoso­phers, or indeed that of The Matrix, a near-oblig­a­tory ref­er­ence for a video like this. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry on from that movie, it’s not hard to under­stand why it res­onat­ed with the siz­able-enough pro­por­tion of human­i­ty who feel alien­at­ed from who they real­ly are or what the world real­ly is — and who, any mil­len­ni­um now, would make rea­son­ably promis­ing can­di­dates to bring about a Gnos­tic revival.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n3,500 Occult Man­u­scripts Will Be Dig­i­tized & Made Freely Avail­able Online, Thanks to The Da Vin­ci Code Author Dan Brown\nBehold the Codex Gigas (aka “Devil’s Bible”), the Largest Medieval Man­u­script in the World\nThe Phi­los­o­phy of The Matrix: From Pla­to and Descartes, to East­ern Phi­los­o­phy\nThe Ancient Greeks Who Con­vert­ed to Bud­dhism\nDis­cov­er Thomas Jefferson’s Cut-and-Paste Ver­sion of the Bible, and Read the Curi­ous Edi­tion Online\nHow Our Depic­tion of Jesus Changed Over 2,000 Years and What He May Have Actu­al­ly Looked Like\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne of the top comments on a new video from the Victoria and Albert Museum reads as follows: “I think it is time to have a renaissance of mourning. In this age of sanitized and hidden grief, it would be a welcomed relief for a more refined mourning experience.”\nThis commenter is responding to two V&A curators unboxing a collection of 19th-century objects common in Victorian mourning traditions. Through a variety of garments, ephemera, and photos, the pair showcases the elaborate rituals and rites people once used to honor the dead.\n\n\n\nThe video highlights a black, silk gown with tiny pleats, delicate lace, and sequins, along with jewelry made from semi-precious jet stones, and brooches containing human hair. The curators also present several printed artifacts, like mourning cards and portraits of the dying.\nWhat becomes clear throughout the video is how much our contemporary culture of grief and loss has turned inward and is something managed privately rather than shared with a community. “Mourning objects can be personal, portable, ostentatious, sentimental, or even a little bit grizzly,” the curators add. “Is it too much? Or do you think we should mourn the passing of these poignant and fascinating trappings of grief?”\nFind the unboxing on YouTube, along with several additional adventures in the museum’s collections.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLocated in the Yangtze River Delta, Hangzhou is enmeshed in waterways. The city’s center abuts a large lake and sits just north of the Qiantang River, infamous for its magnificent tidal bore that sweeps through the region each fall.\nFor their latest project presented in the Hangzhou Triennial of Fiber Art at Zhejiang Art Museum, Jin Choi and Thomas Shine merged aspects of this local environment and culture with their distinctive process. The artists, who work as Choi + Shine Architects, often create sweeping lace isntallations crocheted in partnership with local communities. Choi typically designs the motif, while Shine focuses on the structure itself. \n\nSuspended above reflective surface mimicking a dark body of water, “Distance” comprises crocheted sculptures representing all 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac. “As society evolves, [the zodiac] continues to find relevance, connecting to the wisdom of the past and the shared narratives that shape our identities today,” the artists write. “Its legacy, with its rich symbolism, cultural significance and unifying power, will endure as a navigational tool in the current and future social shifts.”\nRather than depict a dog or rabbit in its entirety, Choi isolated elements of each animal—find preliminary sketches and reference imagery on the artists’ website. The ox, for example, is represented through a slender tube evocative of a horn, while the rooster can be spotted through a fan-like plume. \nThe installation’s structure is circular and appears to shift depending on the viewer’s perpseicve. “The composition loses its legible visual order and the elements start to form different relations, allowing for varying compositions,” the artists say. This emphasizes “one’s power to position oneself in reference to others, to actively define different connections and relationships.”\nAs for the making-of, Choi + Shine know that community members come to their collaborative process with varying levels of craft experience. Their projects often become educational sessions in addition to community gatherings, as participants demonstrate a particular stitch or help troubleshoot issues. \n\n“Many volunteers are actually novices in crochet, and there are many complex patterns. They may not be very good at crochet, so we are in the process of communicating and collaborating. Beginners and skilled volunteers help each other,” said Wu Qin, who led volunteer efforts for this isntallation.\n“Distance” is now permanently isntalled at the Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum.

Pfaff, whose last solo show at a New York gallery was in 2019, has always assembled her sculptures out of diverse materials, from the store-bought and found to the fabricated. In Light Years, we encounter plastic flowers and fruit, a birds’ and a wasps’ nest, recycled plastic carpets, polyurethane foam, steel tubing, and LED and neon light. Pfaff’s bricolage approach combines surgical precision with Surrealist chance, as exemplified by Comte de Lautréamont’s famous statement, “As beautiful as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table.” The difference is that no matter what Pfaff juxtaposes, none of it seems arbitrary. It is as if her materials magically dictate how they should come together. Pfaff’s mastery of radically different scales and diverse materials is a rare achievement. Of the 13 works in Light Years, the largest, “finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions” (2025), is more than 8 feet high, 40 feet in length, and 14 inches deep, while “Purple” (2025), one of a group of small works, measures 19 by 26 by 11 inches. Pfaff’s attunement to heterogeneous objects and materials suggests that she has no agenda; after exhibiting for more than 50 years, she has never settled into a signature style and continues to remain open to different, unexpected possibilities. Installation view of Judy Pfaff: Light Years at Cristin Tierney Gallery. Right: “blue is for sky, yellow is for wheat” (2025)Installation view of Judy Pfaff: Light Years at Cristin Tierney GalleryThree works on view incorporate a recycled woven plastic carpet: “Travels to Bisnegar,” “Rood en Groen (voor Sjorsje),” and “CARPETRIGHT” (all 2025). Yet each work differs from the others based on the way Pfaff has arranged the carpet — from a surface undulating across the wall to a coiled plane folding in on itself. “Travels to Bisnegar” evokes mythological flying carpets and the sprawling network of the Silk Road that connected Asia with the Mediterranean and Europe. The red and green carpet in “Rood en Groen (voor Sjorsje)” establishes the overall palette that guides her toward the sculpture’s other elements, which include plastic flowers, epoxy resin, and LED lights. More than activating the inert matter of her sculptures, tubes of neon light act as a kind of drawing that is connected to the sculpture yet seems to express a desire to become independent. That tension suggests that Pfaff herself has a desire to break free of material bonds and use light to make squiggly lines in space. The neon plays an integral role in the compositions of the small wall works, while in the larger pieces it illuminates from without and within, pulling us closer to the junctures of various forms. It encourages us to go beyond just looking and to discover what she has placed in the works' nooks and crannies. Seeing and wonderment overlap in these sculptures. Judy Pfaff, \"Rood en Groen (voor Sjorsje)\" (2025), steel, epoxy resin, acrylic, imitation flowers, recycled plastic carpet, neon, LED light, polyurethane foamPfaff also recognizes that color isn’t a purely formal phenomenon — it is understood culturally as well. While the title “blue is for sky, yellow is for wheat” refers to the Ukrainian flag, the individual objects transform the flag’s symbolic colors into tangible facts. The thick tree branches, imitation flowers, and fruits brings to mind Ukraine’s importance as a major global supplier of sunflower oil and various grains. Pfaff’s sensitivity to both the identity and color of her materials allows her to address a wide range of subjects without becoming didactic. She doesn’t tell viewers how to think about Ukraine, but invites us to remember the connection between its flag and its rich, productive landscape. The work celebrates the nation’s fertility in the face of its devastation.Pfaff is able to achieve a remarkable balance between the specific subjects she tackles and the open-ended response her art engenders. While she worked in the aftermath of Minimalism and conceptual art, she went her own way and never subscribed to the literal. It is time a New York City institution pays her — a longtime resident of Lower Manhattan, now living in the Hudson Valley — the attention she has long deserved. Serious, whimsical, tender, elegiacal, fantastical, and dreamy, she is a one-person movement — influential but always inimitable.Installation view of Judy Pfaff: Light Years at Cristin Tierney Gallery.

Central to her approach is the conviction that line possesses an animating energy — each brushstroke, drawn gesture, or fusion of color embodies a sense of momentum and fluidity, as if capturing the choreography of nature itself.Throughout the decades, Blitt has consistently drawn inspiration from nature, family, music, and movement, aiming to transform the everyday beauty of neighborhood gardens and trees into expansive contemplations on growth, renewal, and the cyclical nature of life. Through painting, she turns fleeting glimpses of the everyday into meditations on the universal, hoping to remind viewers of nature’s endless potential for artistic transformation. Blitt’s signature style, where movement and color form a contrapuntal interdependence, intends for the local to become universal and the transient to become enduring.“Thinking of Trees IV” (2025) encapsulates these ideas. In this painting, Blitt’s commitment as a colorist is evident: radiant hues envelop energetic lines, echoing her landscapes of the 1960s and the luminous “Ovals” of the 1980s. “Thinking of Trees IV” demonstrates how she infuses color to create atmosphere, layering tones to evoke the shifting light and changing seasons. Sinuous lines suggest tree branches swaying in the breeze, their energy extending beyond the canvas. A visual symphony, harmonies of line and color resonate with the emotional and sensory registers of the natural world, reaffirming Blitt’s effort to translate the essence of nature into vibrant visual music.Find more information on the exhibition at leedy-voulkos.com, and learn about the artist at ritablitt.com.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSponsored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExhibition Announcement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMissouri\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

When letters were found etched on the surface of Oldenburg's “Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks” (1969) last month, the university announced that after 50 years in the Morse College courtyard, the public work would be moved to the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) for “conservation and care,” the Yale Daily News reported.In an email to Hyperallergic, YUAG spokesperson Roland Coffey confirmed that the piece was deinstalled this week and said that “following additional offsite conservation, the sculpture will be displayed in the Gallery’s outdoor sculpture garden in March 2026.” Late artist and Yale alumnus Claes Oldenburg's “Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks” (1969) at the Morse College courtyard on campus (photo courtesy Yale University Art Gallery)Oldenburg, who graduated from Yale in 1950, created the 24-foot steel sculpture in collaboration with a group of the university's architecture students as a surprise gift to the school in 1969 — the same year the school began accepting women to study. It was originally installed with an inflatable lipstick crayon at the university's Beinecke Plaza to serve as a speaking platform during a series of anti-Vietnam War protests, but after severe vandalism, Oldenburg and the students removed and refabricated it for durability before giving it back to Yale. The school shifted the work's ownership to YUAG and re-installed it at the Morse College courtyard in 1974, where it became the campus residential community's emblem for the last half-century. Per an update from Yale Daily News, University President Maurie McInnis clarified that the Lipstick sculpture will be moved to the “back courtyard of YUAG,” to keep it safe from sun damage and vandalism. A minute memorial for a monumental loss (photo by and courtesy Alexa Martindale)While the Morse College community mourns the beloved Lipstick sculpture, Architecture alumni Stuart Wrede and Sam Callaway, who were part of the group that commissioned Oldenburg for the project, have long argued that the sculpture was designed specifically as a public protest work for Beinecke Plaza, and it should be returned there. “I’m sorry, but I find this hilarious as a reason,” Wrede told the college newspaper in response to McInnis citing sun protection among the reasons to move the work. The Lipstick sculpture was selected for a funded restoration over the summer through the Bank of America Art Conservation Project, during which it had been repainted and recoated after years of environmental exposure. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Claes Oldenburg\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tin History, Maps |   \tNovember 7th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nEvery­where you look, you can find traces of the ancient Roman civ­i­liza­tion from which the mod­ern West descends. That’s espe­cial­ly true if you hap­pen to be look­ing in Europe, though echoes of Latin make them­selves heard in major lan­guages used all over the world. Take, for exam­ple, the com­mon Eng­lish word itin­er­ary, mean­ing a planned route for trav­el, which descends from iter, the Latin word for a jour­ney, route, or path. The Romans even­tu­al­ly spoke of itin­er­aria, which meant more or less the same thing as we do when we speak of our trav­el itin­er­aries. Now, bridg­ing these dis­tant eras, we have Itiner‑e, a new online map of ancient Rome’s road net­work, the most com­pre­hen­sive yet.\nOrig­i­nal­ly envi­sioned as a kind of “Google Maps for Roman roads,” Itiner‑e is a project of Tom Brugh­mans of Aarhus Uni­ver­si­ty, and Pau de Soto Caña­mares and Adam Pažout of the Autonomous Uni­ver­si­ty of Barcelona. Its users can dig­i­tal­ly explore near­ly 300,000 kilo­me­ters of roads laid across the vast Roman Empire at its height in the mid-sec­ond cen­tu­ry — or at least as much of that net­work as edu­cat­ed guess­es can recon­struct.\nResearchers can only be sure about less than three per­cent of the net­work, with anoth­er sev­en per­cent of ancient Roman roads doc­u­ment­ed in exis­tence if not in pre­cise loca­tion. Regard­less, Itiner‑e is based on an unprece­dent­ed­ly wide (and open) dataset, which incor­po­rates topo­graph­ic map­ping, satel­lite imagery and cen­turies of his­tor­i­cal records.\n\n\n\t\n\nAmong Itin­er-e’s many fea­tures is a con­fi­dence rat­ing, which shows just how con­fi­dent we can be that any giv­en road actu­al­ly looked like it does on the map. You can also view the whole thing in 3D to get a sense of the ele­va­tions involved in con­struc­tion and trav­el of the net­work; use a rout­ing tool to deter­mine sug­gest­ed routes around the empire “by foot, ox cart or don­key”; and even check satel­lite imagery to find still-extant parts of Roman roads and draw com­par­isons with the same parts of the world today. Though a fair few major Roman roads have evolved into cur­rent routes for trains and auto­mo­biles, we can’t exact­ly trav­el on them in the same way the Romans did. Still, when next you plan a Euro­pean itin­er­ary of your own, con­sid­er punch­ing it in to Itiner‑e and see­ing how the jour­ney most like­ly would’ve been made 1,875 years ago.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Roads of Ancient Rome Visu­al­ized in the Style of Mod­ern Sub­way Maps\nA Map Show­ing How the Ancient Romans Envi­sioned the World in 40 AD\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nThe Roman Roads and Bridges You Can Still Trav­el Today\nPlan Your Trip Across the Roads of the Roman Empire, Using Mod­ern Web Map­ping Tech­nol­o­gy\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nSet against glowing backdrops of desert, city skylines, skate parks, and anonymous interiors, Gerwyn Davies’ vibrant photographs merge fashion photography with elaborate and sometimes bizarre handmade costumes. His practice harkens back to some of his first experiments with photography, when he and a group of friends would stage collaborative portraits in which they’d take turns operating the camera, posing, and searching the house for lamps to light the scene.\n“It was Vogue magazine on a B-horror film budget,” Davies says. “I was transfixed by the potential to fabricate fantasy through photography and from that point I was very excited about what else I could do with it.” He credits those early, playful experiments with his continued fascination with readymades and a highly constructed approach to making a photo.\n\nDavies describes his practice as “queer photographic self-representation.” He designs and creates the costumes himself, transforming the human figure into a sculptural form. Sometimes garments envelop his entire body, but even if his legs or arms are visible, the head is always obscured. When he takes the photo, Davies works blind, snapping a sequence of automatic shots while he quickly performs for the camera. From these, he later selects a final image.\nWhether made of sequined fabric, vinyl, or faux fur, Davies’ costumes border on the quirky, humorous, and even absurd, as he explores the fluid relationship between fantasy and reality. He also plays with notions of what portrait photography is—or it’s intended to reveal about the sitter. In this case, “the subject, which is always me, is conspicuous in the frame,” the artist says, but the nature of concealment adds a playful, sometimes slightly unsettling layer of complexity. He continues: \n\nThe use of elaborate costumes, often fabricated with shimmering and sparkling materials, makes the subject almost hyper-visible. At the same time however, the specifics of the subject are unable to be seen. The face is always obstructed by fabric and the precise dimensions of the figure wildly distort, meaning the subject is impossible to take in fully…the subject is both there and not there, seen and unseen, they are hidden in plain sight.\n\nDavies’ work is featured in Exposure: Contemporary Photographers in Australia and New Zealand, and you can find more on his website and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetroit Institute of Arts Workers United (DIAWU) standing in solidarity outside of the DIA on Tuesday, November 4, 2025. (photo courtesy DIAWU and AFSCME)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nDozens of employees at the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) have gone public with their cross-departmental push to unionize through AFSCME Cultural Workers United this week, hopping on the years-long wave of arts and culture institution workforces organizing nationwide. Under the title DIA Workers United, the group presented the museum with a letter requesting recognition of its union on Tuesday, November 4.\nA spokesperson for AFSCME Michigan told Hyperallergic that they’re “working towards voluntary recognition, and the relationship with the museum has been very positive,” also noting that DIA Workers United represents a “strong majority that is growing every single day.” \nSarah Burger, one of the organizers for DIA Workers United who has worked at the museum as a preparator for 20 years now, told Hyperallergic over the phone that serious conversations about unionizing started towards the end of 2024, and now  “almost every single department within the museum is being represented at this point.”\n Burger explained that like many other cultural worker unions, DIA Workers United comes together out of love for the museum and the work being done within it, telling Hyperallergic that staff are “passionate about their work, but they just wanna make ends meet.”\n“ I personally have been priced out of two neighborhoods,” Burger stated. She said she’s lived in Detroit for 25 years, and that the city is in the midst of a major development and revitalization effort that has already led to rising rents and housing costs. \nThe worker also lauded the DIA’s board and administration for the museum’s growing endowment, as well as the stable operations budget secured through the Tri-County millage (in which 0.2% property taxes from Macomb, Wayne, and Oakland counties go toward funding the museum) in 2012 and again 2021, but noted that “in a financially secure institution, there’s no reason that that full-time employees should be working a second job.”\n“ I do think that people at the ‘top’ ought to be compensated well for those efforts, but the people at the ‘bottom’ are also very important and all deserve to be getting a living wage,” Burger continued. She pointed out that the lowest wage at the museum is $16.50 an hour; the museum is currently advertising roles in visitor experience, security, and retail sales at this rate. \nDIA has not yet replied to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment. \nBurger also alleged that DIA has left certain positions vacant for over a year, and had employees in subordinate roles assume the responsibilities of said positions without providing them with title changes, promotions, or increases in compensation. \n“We don’t want this to be an ‘us versus them’ situation,” Burger said of DIA Workers United’s relationship with the museum, alluding to how the Los Angeles County Museum of Art recently declined to recognize its staff’s union this week. \n“ We want to work with [the museum], we want to negotiate. I think we’ll be able to strike a balance with the administration and truly have a partnership,” Burger explained. “I think that’s exciting, because if your employees are thriving, then the museum is really going to be thriving.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nJean Auguste Dominique Ingres’ “The Princesse de Broglie” at the Met Museum in New York may have been damaged by a rogue visitor. (1825–1860 (courtesy the Metropolitan Museum of Art)\nOn Halloween, while dressed as Dakota Johnson from her Architectural Digest home tour, I was approached by a blond man in all black clothing, a safety vest, and a tiara who needed directions.\n“Louvre thief!” I shouted at him. “I thought you were arrested.” Drunk twenty-somethings in safety vests buzzed around us in the East Village, as if they’d answered some sort of casting call. It was official: the Louvre thief was 2025’s NPC (Non-Playable Character for those unfamiliar with Gen-Z English) costume of the year.\nThis major art heist extended its reach far beyond the art world and into the cultural vernacular as a low-budget costume option. While the Louvre break-in might be the most ubiquitous art-involved criminal behavior in the news right now, there are a few other thefts and petty vandalisms that Hyperallergic is keeping tabs on, including an incident at the Metropolitan Museum of Art this week and a 1,000-item heist in Oakland, California. I have the latest for you.\n\nA Social Media Star among the Louvre suspects?\nParisian media reported that one of the four Louvre heist suspects in custody was a local social media “star” and motorbike enthusiast named Abdouldaye N, who goes by the alias “Doudou Cross Bitume” online and was once a security guard at the Centre Pompidou. “Star” might be a generous label, however, as accounts on YouTube and Instagram matching the name and description have less than 1,000 followers combined. If that’s the case, I guess you can call me a social media star too.\nThe Guardian observed that in several of Mr. Bitume’s uploads, he is “shown riding a Yamaha TMax, the particularly powerful make of mega-scooter used in the Louvre thieves’ getaway.” Equally ridiculous is the revelation that the password to the museum’s security system was, wait for it, “Louvre,” according to reports.\nThe Galerie d’Apollon at the Louvre Museum (photo by Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images)\nA splash at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEight minutes before the Met Museum closed on Monday, November 3, a 19-year-old “damaged multiple exhibits,” the New York Police Department confirmed in an email. The museum has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s requests for information on which works were damaged, but tabloids reported that the individual threw water at “The Princesse de Broglie” (1851-53) by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and “Madonna and Child with Saints” (c. 1520) by Girolamo dai Libri. He was charged with criminal mischief, police said.\nGoogly Eyes in Australia\nAnother 19-year-old in Australia reportedly stuck googly eyes on a recently installed public sculpture by architects Tom Proctor and Mitch Walker, nicknamed “Blue Blob,” the BBC reported. She appeared this week in court for property damage to the $89,000 sculpture, which is really called “Cast in Blue.” But the real damage seems to have been committed by the people who removed the googly eyes, tearing away the blue paint.\nThe 19-year-old charged with putting googly eyes on a sculpture in Australia made the altered artwork her Facebook profile photo. (screenshot Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic via Facebook)\nHow did they steal 1,000 collection items?\nLast month, suspected thieves took around 1,000 collection items from the Oakland Museum of California that were stored at an off-site location. Police released video footage this week of two individuals apparently scoping out what appears to be a storage facility. It does not, however, show the thieves making off with the absurd number of objects.  \nItty-bitty Picasso Found\nRemember the iPhone-sized painting by Pablo Picasso that went missing in Spain last month, ahead of its scheduled shipment to a Granada museum? Turns out, a neighbor named Dolores had accidentally picked up the package, and it never made it onto the delivery van in the first place. Case closed for everyone except for Dolores, who anxiously gave an interview to El País last week to clear her name.\nLost and found: Pablo Picasso’s “Naturaleza muerta con guitarra (Still life with a guitar)” (1919) (courtesy CajaGranada Fundación)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

(all images courtesy Madalyn Drewno)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThree free speech groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, have accused the History Colorado Center, a nonprofit museum linked to the state’s Department of Higher Education, of censoring an artwork that contained pro-Palestine symbols and criticism of ICE and two United States senators.\nThe allegedly censored painting, Denver-based illustrator Madalyn Drewno’s “None of Us Are Free Until All of Us Are Free” (2025), was commissioned by a local organization for the museum’s exhibition Big Dreams in Little Saigon, which examines aspects of the city’s Vietnamese enclave. Drewno’s painting portrayed Ivy Ha, a community member who fled the Vietnam War, and her daughter Joie, against a background of collaged figures, including Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two foreign students in the US who had been detained for their views on Gaza. The work also features Palestinian flags, anti-ICE slogans, Colorado Governor Jared Polis with a red hand over his mouth, and accuses the state’s Democratic Senator Michael Bennett of “fund[ing] genocide.” \nDrewno said she was notified that the museum could not show her work in compliance with Colorado’s Fair Campaign Practices Act, which prohibits state agencies from financially contributing to candidates running for public office.\nHowever, in a letter sent to the History Colorado’s president on Monday, November 3, the ACLU’s Colorado chapter, National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) wrote that the work’s removal “seems more likely related to the pointed political sentiments present in the background of the painting.” The groups are urging the museum to reinstate the artwork and apologize to Drewno.\n\n“Letting Go and Holding On” (2025), part of the three-painting series, was not removed from the show. \nFour days ahead of the show’s October 21 opening, Drewno told Hyperallergic in a phone interview, she was notified that one of her three paintings would not be included in the show.\nIn an October 16 email reviewed by Hyperallergic, the Colorado Asian Pacific United (CAPU), a local cultural nonprofit that co-organized the show with the museum, told Drewno that History Colorado decided not to show “None of Us Are Free Until All of Us Are Free” because doing so could subject the institution to “legal risk” related to campaign finance laws.\nThe museum’s Chief Creative Officer, Jason Hanson, told Hyperallergic in a statement that the museum had not expected the artwork it received.\n“The artwork delivered through our community partner shortly before the exhibition’s opening was significantly different than the artwork proposed, and we do not use public funds or resources to platform opinions that could be perceived as campaigning for or against current candidates or ballot issues,” Hanson said. According to a contract commissioning the artworks reviewed by Hyperallergic, CAPU, not the museum, paid Drewno $2,500 for the three paintings. \nIn their November 3 letter, the free speech organizations called the museum’s citation of campaign finance laws “not credible.”\n“The mere display of an artwork that is critical of public officials — regardless ofwhether or not they seek future election — cannot be understood as a campaign ‘contribution’ favoring a specific political candidate,” the groups wrote.\nDrewno explained that the paintings were inspired by Ha’s story of fleeing Vietnam, but over the course of the series, more broadly incorporated themes of resilience in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities and future generations.\n ”It was my intention to start a discussion around our interconnected struggles with what’s going on in the world currently, and that includes ICE and their violence against the immigrant community and how that is also connected to Palestine,” Drewno told Hyperallergic.\nJoie Ha, depicted in the work alongside her mother Ivy, told Hyperallergic in an email that she and her mother have asked the speech groups not to be involved in the dispute over the artwork. “My mother is upset by this misuse of her refugee story, and has expressed that she does not want any association with their campaign,” Ha wrote.\nA spokesperson for CAPU said that while the organization commissioned Drewno’s work for the show, it ” did not have a role in the decision to remove the artwork.” The spokesperson said the organization attempted to reach a compromise with the museum, but was unable to.\nDrewno said she decided to reach out to freedom of speech organizations about her work after she spoke to Húŋkpapȟa Lakȟóta artist Danielle SeeWalker, whose pro-Palestine painting led to a First Amendment lawsuit against the town of Vail last year.\n“ In the same way that Danielle SeeWalker inspired me,” Drewno said, “I also want to encourage other artists to speak up and show that it can be done and that there is support.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\tin Design, History, Religion |   \tJanuary 6th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt was long ago that poly­the­ism, as the sto­ry comes down to us, gave way to monothe­ism. Human­i­ty used to have many gods, and now almost every reli­gious believ­er acknowl­edges just one — though which god, exact­ly, does vary. Some pop­u­lar the­o­ries of “big his­to­ry” hold that, as the scale of a soci­ety grows larg­er, the num­ber of deities pro­posed by its faiths gets small­er. In that scheme, it makes sense that the grow­ing Roman Empire would even­tu­al­ly adopt Chris­tian­i­ty, and also that the gods it first inher­it­ed from the city-states of ancient Greece would be so numer­ous. Through our mod­ern eyes, the var­i­ous immor­tals invoked so read­i­ly by the Greeks look less like holy fig­ures than a cast of char­ac­ters in a long-run­ning tele­vi­sion dra­ma.\nOr maybe it would have to be a soap opera, giv­en that most of them belong to one big, often trou­bled clan. Hence the struc­ture of Use­fulCharts’ Greek Mythol­o­gy Fam­i­ly Tree, explained in the video above. Also avail­able for pur­chase in poster form, it clear­ly dia­grams the rela­tion­ships between every­one in the Greek pan­theon, from the high­est “pri­mor­dial gods” like Eros Elder and Gaia down to the chil­dren of Zeus and Posei­don.\nHow­ev­er pow­er­ful they could be — and some were pow­er­ful indeed — none of these gods act­ed like the infal­li­ble, omni­scient enti­ties of the major reli­gions we know today. They could act capri­cious­ly, venge­ful­ly and even non­sen­si­cal­ly, a reflec­tion of the often capricious‑, vengeful‑, and non­sen­si­cal-seem­ing nature of life in the ancient world.\nFor the Greeks them­selves, these myth­i­cal gods and mon­sters offered not just an explana­to­ry mech­a­nism, but also a form of enter­tain­ment, giv­en that noth­ing could go on in their ele­vat­ed world with­out high dra­ma. For us, they remain present in leg­ends from which we still draw inspi­ra­tion for our own larg­er-than-life sto­ries of hero­ism and vil­lainy, but also in our very lan­guage. Con­sid­er the ways in which we con­tin­ue to evoke the likes of the time-rul­ing Chronos, the love-bring­ing Cupid, the androg­y­nous Her­maph­ro­di­tus, or the mul­ti-head­ed Hydra in every­day speech. Though we may no longer need them to orga­nize our soci­eties, some of them have kept play­ing roles in the age of monothe­ism — which, what­ev­er its oth­er advan­tages, does­n’t require us to con­sult dia­grams to know who’s who.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMythos: An Ani­ma­tion Retells Time­less Greek Myths with Abstract Mod­ern Designs\nMythol­o­gy Expert Reviews Depic­tions of Greek & Roman Myths in Pop­u­lar Movies and TV Shows\nHow the Ancient Greeks Built Their Mag­nif­i­cent Tem­ples: The Art of Ancient Engi­neer­ing\n18 Clas­sic Myths Explained with Ani­ma­tion: Pandora’s Box, Sisy­phus & More\nCon­cepts of the Hero in Greek Civ­i­liza­tion (A Free Har­vard Course)\nA Visu­al Time­line of World His­to­ry: Watch the Rise & Fall of Civ­i­liza­tions Over 5,000 Years\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Audio Books, Literature |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHav­ing not revis­it­ed The Hob­bit in some time, I’ve felt the famil­iar pull—shared by many readers—to return to Tolkien’s fairy-tale nov­el itself. It was my first expo­sure to Tolkien, and the per­fect book for a young read­er ready to dive into moral com­plex­i­ty and a ful­ly-real­ized fic­tion­al world.\nAnd what bet­ter guide could there be through The Hob­bit than Tolkien him­self, read­ing (above) from the 1937 work? In this 1952 record­ing in two parts (part 2 is below), the ven­er­a­ble fan­ta­sist and schol­ar reads from his own work for the first time on tape.\nTolkien begins with a pas­sage that first describes the crea­ture Gol­lum; lis­ten­ing to this descrip­tion again, I am struck by how much dif­fer­ent­ly I imag­ined him when I first read the book. The Gol­lum of The Hob­bit seems some­how hoari­er and more mon­strous than many lat­er visu­al inter­pre­ta­tions. This is a minor point and not a crit­i­cism, but per­haps a com­ment on how nec­es­sary it is to return to the source of a myth­ic world as rich as Tolkien’s, even, or espe­cial­ly, when it’s been so well-real­ized in oth­er media. No one, after all, knows Mid­dle Earth bet­ter than its cre­ator.\n\n\n\t\n\nThese read­ings were part of a much longer record­ing ses­sion, dur­ing which Tolkien also read (and sang!) exten­sive­ly from The Lord of the Rings. A YouTube user has col­lect­ed, in sev­er­al parts, a radio broad­cast of that full ses­sion, and it’s cer­tain­ly worth your time to lis­ten to it all the way through. It’s also worth know­ing the neat con­text of the record­ing. Here’s the text that accom­pa­nies the video on YouTube:\nWhen Tolkien vis­it­ed a friend in August of 1952 to retrieve a man­u­script of The Lord of the Rings, he was shown a “tape recorder”. Hav­ing nev­er seen one before, he asked how it worked and was then delight­ed to have his voice record­ed and hear him­self played back for the first time. His friend then asked him to read from The Hob­bit, and Tolkien did so in this one incred­i­ble take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2012.\nRelat­ed Con­tent\nLis­ten to J.R.R.

    "body": "\n\tin Life, Philosophy |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEach cul­ture has its own say­ings about the unique­ness and tran­sience of the present moment. In recent years, the Eng­lish-speak­ers have often found them­selves remind­ed, through the expres­sion “YOLO,” that they only live once. (The ques­tion of whether that should real­ly be “YLOO,” or “You Live Only Once,” we put aside for the time being.) In Japan, unsur­pris­ing­ly, one some­times hears a much more ven­er­a­ble equiv­a­lent: “ichi-go ichi‑e,” which some read­ers acquaint­ed with the Japan­ese lan­guage should be assured has noth­ing to do with straw­ber­ries, ichi­go. Rather, the say­ing’s under­ly­ing Chi­nese char­ac­ters (一期一会) can be trans­lat­ed as “one time, one meet­ing.”\nThe Bud­dhis­ti­cal­ly inflect­ed “ichi-go ichi‑e” is just one in the vast library of yoji­juku­go, high­ly con­densed apho­ris­tic expres­sions writ­ten with just four char­ac­ters. (Oth­er coun­tries with Chi­nese-influ­enced lan­guages have their ver­sions, includ­ing sajaseon­geo in Korea and chéngyǔ in Chi­na itself.) It descends, as the sto­ry goes, from a slight­ly longer say­ing favored by the six­teenth-cen­tu­ry tea mas­ter Sen no Rikyū, “ichi-go ni ichi-do” (一期に一度).\nOne must pay respects to the host of a tea cer­e­mo­ny because the meet­ing would only ever occur once — which, of course, it would, even if the cer­e­mo­ny was a reg­u­lar­ly sched­uled event. For we nev­er, to bor­row an ancient Greek take on this whole sub­ject, step into the same riv­er twice; no two events, sep­a­rat­ed in time, can ever tru­ly be iden­ti­cal.\n\n\n\t\n\nOne impli­ca­tion, as not­ed in the explana­to­ry videos above from the BBC and Einzel­gänger, is that we should savor what­ev­er moment we hap­pen to find our­selves in, how­ev­er imper­fect, because we won’t get a sec­ond chance to do so. And if it offers lit­tle or noth­ing to enjoy, we can find solace in the fact that its par­tic­u­lar dis­plea­sure, too, can nev­er revis­it us. With the past gone and the future nev­er guar­an­teed, the present moment, in any case, is the only time that actu­al­ly exists for us, so we’d bet­ter make our­selves com­fort­able with­in it. Though these ideas have per­haps found their most ele­gant and mem­o­rable expres­sion in Japan, they’re hard­ly con­sid­ered exclu­sive cul­tur­al prop­er­ty there.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Nature, Photography, Science |   \tJanuary 6th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nAre we tru­ly in the midst of a human-caused sixth mass extinc­tion, an era of “bio­log­i­cal anni­hi­la­tion”? Many sci­en­tists and pop­u­lar sci­ence writ­ers say yes, using terms like “Holocene” or “Anthro­pocene” to describe what fol­lows the Ordovi­cian, Devon­ian, Per­mi­an, Tri­as­sic, and Cre­ta­ceous peri­ods. Peter Bran­nen, the author of extinc­tion his­to­ry The Ends of the Earth has found at least one sci­en­tist who thinks the con­cept is “junk.” But Bran­nen quotes some alarm­ing sta­tis­tics. Chill­ing, even. “Until very recent­ly,” he writes, “all ver­te­brate life on the plan­et was wildlife. But astound­ing­ly, today wildlife accounts for only 3 per­cent of Earth’s land ani­mals; human beings, our live­stock, and our pets take up the remain­ing 97 per­cent of the bio­mass… almost half of the Earth’s land has been con­vert­ed into farm­land.”\n\nThis state of affairs does not bode well for the mil­lions of remain­ing species get­ting edged out of their envi­ron­ments by agribusi­ness and cli­mate change. We learn from extinc­tions past that the plan­et rebounds after unimag­in­able cat­a­stro­phe. Life real­ly does go on, though it may take mil­lions of years to recov­er. But the cur­rent forms of life may dis­ap­pear before their time. If we want to under­stand what is at stake besides our own frag­ile fos­sil-fuel-based civ­i­liza­tions, we need to con­nect to life emo­tion­al­ly as well as intel­lec­tu­al­ly. Short of globe-hop­ping phys­i­cal immer­sion in the Earth’s bio­di­ver­si­ty, we could hard­ly do bet­ter than immers­ing our­selves in the tra­di­tion of nat­u­ral­ist writ­ing, art, and pho­tog­ra­phy that brings the world to us.\n\nThe Bio­di­ver­si­ty Her­itage Library (BHL), an “open access dig­i­tal library for bio­di­ver­si­ty lit­er­a­ture and archives,” has for many years been mak­ing it easy for peo­ple to con­nect to nature through nature writ­ing and illus­tra­tion. On Flickr, you can find 319,000 care­ful­ly curat­ed images. The col­lec­tion itself is sub­di­vid­ed into dif­fer­ent pho­to albums drawn from his­tor­i­cal pub­li­ca­tions. For exam­ple, The Fresh­wa­ter Fish­es of the British Isles (1911), The Bird (1869), and The Insect Book (1901).\n\nThis image archive offers expan­sive views of human­i­ty’s encounter with the nat­ur­al world, not only through sta­tis­tics and aca­d­e­m­ic jar­gon, but through the artis­tic record­ing of won­der, sci­en­tif­ic curios­i­ty, and deep appre­ci­a­tion.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the early 20th century, Russia underwent a series of drastic and devastating changes. After centuries of imperial rule, the 1917 Russian Revolution put an end to the Romanov dynasty and hailed the start of a new era under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, head of the Bolshevik Party. This government body eventually became known as the Communist Party, and Russia was dubbed the Union of Soviet Social Republicans, or the U.S.S.R.\nIn 1927, everything changed again. Lenin died that year, and a new leader maneuvered into power: Joseph Stalin. Fundamentally a dictator, Stalin ruled through terror and used violence and oppressive tactics to instill a government-controlled society. His approach essentially defines totalitarianism, in which the state asserts absolute dominance over every aspect of people’s lives and livelihoods.\n\n\n\nIn 1937, 10 years into the Stalinist period, the short film “Father’s Letters” opens. Written and directed by Alexey Evstigneev, the animation traces a narrative of correspondence between a real-life father, Professor Vangengheim, and his daughter Eleonora, who he calls Elya.\nVangengheim was a weather forecaster for Stalin, and he headed up the U.S.S.R.’s meteorology department—a role that had great implications for the success of socialist agriculture practices. When a ruinous famine hit between 1932 and 1933, Vangengheim was scapegoated with a claim that he had falsified weather forecasts to sabotage the crops. In January 1934, he was arrested and transported to the remote Solovetsky Islands, near the Arctic Circle.\nEleonora, who lived in Moscow, witnessed nationalist demonstrations and was largely shielded from the knowledge that her father was banished to a remote outpost of the Soviet Gulag. In his letters, written on cigarette-rolling paper, Vangengheim details his “expedition,” describing how he is researching plant life in the Arctic. The real letters were preserved by Eleonora and later published.\n\nThe Gulag system was established shortly after the Russian Revolution, and Stalin actively expanded it. It’s estimated that around 18 million people passed through the Gulag, and more than than a quarter did not survive. The film’s emphasis on 1937 marks a particularly terrible time during Stalin’s rule known as the Great Purge, or the Great Terror, of which the sole purpose was eradicating people who disagreed with the dictator’s philosophy.\nThose thought to be traitors of the state were arrested, imprisoned, and executed—often without trial—in a wholesale expulsion of people who threatened Communist ideals and Stalin’s absolute power. This included persecuting political rivals, bureaucrats, and intellectuals—because only the state could determine what information, art, or “truths” the public had access to.\nStalin’s secret police, known as the NKVD, officially counted more than 680,000 individuals who were shot between 1937 and 1938, but scholars estimate that the entire number of fatalities during the Great Purge could be double that.\n\nFor Evstigneev, this horrific period sets the stage for a poignant tale of love, innocence, and hope as well as a stark reflection of the cruelty of the Gulag. A team of animators and producers worked with the director to create a painterly world that combines hand-drawn pastel elements, a two-dimensional vector-based technique, and stop-motion. \nWhile imprisoned, Vangengheim is forced to work on a portrait of Stalin made of dandelions, however when he damages the tribute, he meets a grisly fate. In real life, his family didn’t learn of his death until nearly two decades later.\nIn Evstigneev’s film, Elya reads of her father’s “explorations” in the north and is reminded of the life cycle of flowers and their floating seeds, encouraging her to focus on future growth.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCombining a variety of fabrics, buttons, shells, and beads, Stephen Towns’ mixed-media textile pieces draw on the rich heritage of quilts made especially by Black women in the American South. Tableaux reminiscent of family portraits and vacation snapshots lend themselves to an exploration of the power of pleasure and community during an era when the South was still racially segregated.\nTowns’ solo exhibition, Safer Waters: Picturing Black Recreation at Midcentury at the Wichita Art Museum, is an extension of the artist’s ongoing series exploring Black leisure in the era of Jim Crow.\n“And it Was Joy That Covered Us” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, and glass beads, 55 x 65 1/2 inches\nLarge-scale compositions sing with vibrant color, portraying families and groups of friends in the midst of dance parties, sunbathing, boating, and swimming at a resort in Florida called Paradise Park. It wasn’t until 1968, with the passing of the Civil Rights Act, that desegregation laws finally negated the need for Black-only businesses and destinations, and Paradise Park, which was advertised “for colored people,” closed in 1969.\nTowns examines the nature of not only relaxation but escape, celebrating the vibrancy of Black joy despite a period of unabashed oppression toward people of color. He emphasizes child-like innocence, togetherness, and leisure as a form of resistance.\nSafer Waters expands his ongoing body of work with the addition of seven new works, shown here. The exhibition continues through June 14, and you can see more by Towns on Instagram.\n“And the Jukebox Played On” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, and rhinestones, 56 1/2 x 67 1/2 inches\n“You are the Meditation of My Heart” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, rhinestones, and metal and glass buttons, 57 1/2 x 69 1/2 inches\n“Until the Flames Burn Out” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, rhinestones,and glass button, 56 x 64 inches\n“All We Knew Was Joy” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, glass beads, and shell, 55 x 65 1/2 inches\n“Luncheon on the Sand” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, glass beads, and button, 71 1/2 x 59 1/2 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

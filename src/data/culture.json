    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tFebruary 17th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe appear­ance of the Dead Sea Scrolls was the most impor­tant doc­u­ment dis­cov­ery of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry. Yet, in some sense, they did­n’t deliv­er what many assumed to be promised with­in: that is, the basis for a com­plete revi­sion of every­thing we thought we knew about Chris­tian­i­ty. The real­i­ty of the Dead Sea Scrolls’ con­tent is less sim­ple, but also stranger — which makes it an ide­al sub­ject for the YouTube chan­nel Hochela­ga, giv­en its pen­chant for explor­ing the obscure byways of reli­gious his­to­ry. And indeed, as host Tom­mie Trelawny says in his new video above, they are the “old­est Bib­li­cal writ­ings ever found,” a sta­tus that, what­ev­er their specifics, cer­tain­ly jus­ti­fies the great scruti­ny paid to them over the past eight decades.\nFor it was only in 1946 that the Scrolls were found, by a Bedouin shep­herd look­ing for his lost goat in a series of caves in the vicin­i­ty of ancient ruins by the Dead Sea. Or so the sto­ry goes, any­way, and Trelawny explains some of the com­pli­ca­tions that emerge when it’s exam­ined more close­ly.\nBut the fact remains that those caves did con­tain, tight­ly rolled up and for the most part well-pre­served, a set of scrolls adding up to “around 900 indi­vid­ual man­u­scripts: 40 per­cent of them “resem­bled books found in the Bible”; 30 per­cent, apoc­ryphal writ­ings “banned” from the Bible; and anoth­er 30 per­cent, “writ­ings pre­vi­ous­ly unknown to schol­ar­ship.” Those last include “texts that described a secre­tive reli­gious com­mu­ni­ty and apoc­a­lyp­tic visions of a great heav­en­ly war.”\nMost intrigu­ing­ly, there was also “a scroll made entire­ly of cop­per that lists the loca­tions of lost trea­sure.” None of it has ever been found, much as the con­tent of the oth­er texts has­n’t forced a great rethink­ing of the reli­gion at the cen­ter of so much of West­ern civ­i­liza­tion. In fact, as Bib­li­cal schol­ar Robert Alter writes in the Lon­don Review of Books, “the notion that these sec­tar­i­an writ­ings are actu­al­ly Chris­t­ian has no schol­ar­ly cred­i­bil­i­ty,” though some researchers argue that “the blue­print for the Gospel nar­ra­tives,” mes­si­ah fig­ure and all, “was laid out in the Scrolls and fol­lowed by the first Chris­t­ian writ­ers.” They do, how­ev­er, reveal a great deal about the world­view of the par­tic­u­lar fringe faith­ful who took to the desert to keep their unortho­dox beliefs safe from the harsh judg­ment of main­stream soci­ety — and, for about twen­ty cen­turies, safe they remained.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nGoogle Puts The Dead Sea Scrolls Online (in Super High Res­o­lu­tion)\nGoogle Dig­i­tizes Ancient Copies of the Ten Com­mand­ments and Gen­e­sis\n2,000-Year-Old Man­u­script of the Ten Com­mand­ments Gets Dig­i­tized: See/Download “Nash Papyrus” in High Res­o­lu­tion\nHow Ancient Scrolls, Charred by the Erup­tion of Mount Vesu­vius in 79 AD, Are Now Being Read by Par­ti­cle Accel­er­a­tors, 3D Mod­el­ing & Arti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence\nThe Gnos­tic Gospels: An Intro­duc­tion to the For­bid­den Teach­ings of Jesus\nIntro­duc­tion to the Old Tes­ta­ment: A Free Yale Course\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nApart from a few bridges that still work, the infra­struc­tur­al achieve­ments of the Roman Empire exist, for us, most­ly as ruins. With a lit­tle imag­i­na­tion, those his­toric sites give us a clear enough sense of the empire’s sheer might, but if we want to go deep­er, we should then look into the numer­ous Roman con­struc­tions that haven’t sur­vived at all. In the video below from his chan­nel Told in Stone, ancient-his­to­ry YouTu­ber Gar­rett Ryan gives his per­son­al top sev­en “lost Roman won­ders,” begin­ning with Trajan’s Bridge, whose length of more than a kilo­me­ter across the Danube made it the longest bridge ever built at that time: a project of ambi­tions befit­ting a man that his­to­ry remem­bers as one of the “Five Good Emper­ors.”\nNo such sta­tus for Nero, though he did com­mis­sion the Subi­a­co Dams. Nec­es­sary to cre­ate a series of arti­fi­cial lakes beneath the infa­mous ruler’s vil­la, they were the high­est dams in exis­tence until the Mid­dle Ages. Hadri­an’s more pub­lic-mind­ed white-mar­ble tem­ple at Cyz­i­cus in mod­ern-day Turkey was known as unusu­al­ly splen­did even by the stan­dards of that genre of build­ing; now only its foun­da­tions remain, with archae­o­log­i­cal digs turn­ing up the occa­sion­al frag­ment.\nIn the for­mer Con­stan­tino­ple, the Church of the Holy Apos­tles is remem­bered as the sec­ond-most famous van­ished ear­ly Chris­t­ian church, after only the old St. Peter’s Basil­i­ca in Rome. Hagia Sophia may still be around, but the Col­umn of Jus­tin­ian that once stood between it and the Great Palace was melt­ed down for scrap long ago.\n\n\n\t\n\nWe only know of these lost struc­tures because we have his­tor­i­cal attes­ta­tions of their exis­tence, most vivid­ly in paint­ings: take the Pyra­mid of Romu­lus, a strik­ing tomb that appears near the Vat­i­can in The Vision of the Cross, which Raphael’s assis­tants pro­duced after his death. Oth­ers, like the Colos­sus of Nero from which the Colos­se­um takes its name, are rep­re­sent­ed on coins. In the video at the top, Ryan cov­ers three more “for­got­ten Roman megapro­jects”: Claudius’ tun­nel of record-mak­ing length through the moun­tain between the Riv­er Liris and the Fucine Lake, Tra­jan’s mil­i­tary high­way through the “Iron Gates” of the Danube, and Octa­vian’s secret har­bor at Lake Aver­nus. In our time, of course, there are no more emper­ors, Roman or oth­er­wise, and we’re sure­ly bet­ter off for it. But we can still admire — to use a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­cept — the state capac­i­ty they com­mand­ed.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Genius Engi­neer­ing of Roman Aque­ducts\nThe Roman Colos­se­um Decon­struct­ed: 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals the Hid­den Tech­nol­o­gy That Pow­ered Rome’s Great Are­na\nThe Amaz­ing Engi­neer­ing of Roman Baths\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMad­man or vision­ary? A lit­tle of both? A genius? A brand? A men­sch? David Lynch was all these things and more, and this fan-made video above serves as a quick reminder of the career and the con­sis­ten­cy of the film director/artist/transcendental med­i­ta­tor who passed away last year.\nEar­ly in the video we see one of the director’s pub­lic­i­ty stunts, when he sat in a chair on the cor­ner of La Brea and Hol­ly­wood, next to a cow and a large poster of Lau­ra Dern. No, the cow had noth­ing to do with the film he was promoting—2006’s Inland Empire—but it did stop traf­fic and draw atten­tion. Lynch didn’t have an adver­tis­ing bud­get to pro­mote Lau­ra Dern’s lead role in the film, so the cow had to do.\nLau­ra Dern appeared in a major­i­ty of Lynch’s films begin­ning with 1986’s Blue Vel­vet, and the video hon­ors their friend­ship (he called her “Tid­bit”) as well as his col­lab­o­ra­tions with Kyle MacLach­lan (who Lynch called “Kale”) and Nao­mi Watts. All three obvi­ous­ly adored him.\nThere’s also a com­pi­la­tion of Lynch swear­ing like a champ. Prod­uct place­ment in film is “bull­shit,” prob­lems on set are “fuck­ing nuts,” and for those who sat through the “peanut sweep­ing” scene in Twin Peaks The Return, you’ll under­stand his out­burst on set: “Who gives a fuc&ing $hit how long a scene is?”\nWe’ve linked pre­vi­ous­ly to Lynch’s video where he makes quinoa, and this short edit sums up that video nice­ly. It’s also nice to see atten­tion giv­en to The Straight Sto­ry, which usu­al­ly gets passed over in his fil­mog­ra­phy, despite (or maybe because of) being his sweet­est movie.\nThere’s also a reminder that Lynch made videos from quar­an­tine in his Los Ange­les home. Not only did he deliv­er the dai­ly weath­er reports like he used to, but he also announced “Today’s Num­ber,” which caused quite a lot of anx­i­ety in the YouTube com­ments. (Why no sev­en? WHY NO NUMBER 7?)\nThe video ends with Lynch’s the­o­ry about catch­ing ideas like fish—we’ve also high­light­ed this before—and then a love­ly mon­tage of title cards, remind­ing us all that “Direct­ed by David Lynch” remains a guar­an­teed sign of qual­i­ty.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nTwin Peaks Actu­al­ly Explained: A 4‑Hour Video Essay Demys­ti­fies It All\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nDavid Lynch Made a Dis­turb­ing Web Sit­com Called “Rab­bits”: It’s Now Used by Psy­chol­o­gists to Induce a Sense of Exis­ten­tial Cri­sis in Research Sub­jects\nPat­ti Smith and David Lynch Talk About the Source of Their Ideas & Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor all of the “progress” associated with advancing technologies and the purported conveniences of having tiny, powerful computers at our fingertips, there are certainly some drawbacks. Smartphones today—and their millions of apps—are data-collecting devices as much as they are portals to search engines, maps, social media, the news, and anything else on the internet. And the market for regular hardware upgrades and software updates can trap us in a perpetual loop, spending big money for faster speeds and the newest features.\nThere’s certainly some merit in phones and gear that are a bit “less smart.” Just as the Luddite Club, members of which prefer to switch off or use “dumb phones,” citing the value of building real-life friendships rather than spending a ton of time on social apps. For a lot of Millennials who came of age as cell phones rolled out, they’re just old enough to remember AOL Instant Messenger, chatrooms, basic flip phones, and pixelated Game Boys. The generation can recall an earlier, simpler era of digital tech and the World Wide Web despite being the first to enter adulthood and careers that have been indelibly shaped by its transformations.\n“Never Mess With a Bitch With a Blackberry” (2026), acrylic crochet mounted on wood\nFor one such Millennial, Nicole Nikolich, a.k.a. Lace in the Moon, throwback devices from the early 2000s like the Blackberry, T9 phones, and Nokia’s “Bricks” are sources of reminiscence, play, and inspiration. Through the medium of crochet, itself a craft practice deeply entwined with comfort and nostalgia, the artist has created a series of larger-than-life fiber portraits of iconic digital objects and icons for her solo exhibition user_history at Paradigm Gallery + Studio.\nCrochet—and by extension, craft—might be seen as something of an antithesis to the digital or virtual realm. One must use their hands to do a timeless, manual activity, and it doesn’t get much more analog than physical yarn and a needle or two. A stitch may also be likened to a pixel, as one tiny component is a building block that can add up to an entire image or object when combined with thousands of others.\nBy translating old phones, handheld video games, and outdated application icons into stitched fiber, Nikolich emphasizes the power of concentration, imperfection, and the handmade—not only in terms of making but in our daily interactions and relationships with ourselves and others. “In her largest body of work to date, Nikolich reminds us of the varied methods of human connection while combining traditional craft and the digital world,” the gallery says.\nuser_history runs from March 6 to 29 in Philadelphia.

The writer and poet Ocean Vuong, for instance, is the sort of person one could reasonably describe in a press release as “one of the defining voices of his generation” without raising any eyebrows. It’s not surprising, then, that when Vuong publicly revealed that he’s a photographer, too, he soon landed a solo exhibition at the Center for Photography at Woodstock, the Hudson Valley photo mecca now housed in a lovingly restored four-story factory building. Without having seen the show, one might assume that Vuong’s photography is the nepo baby of his writing. That question is unavoidable — let’s just say that most artists’ first exhibitions aren’t in spacious galleries at venues like this. But, to be fair, most artists’ first exhibitions don’t look like this: The photographs come out swinging. It’s genuinely a great show. Vuong has apparently been taking pictures ever since he was a teenager, when a friend handed him a Nikon camera to shoot flash photos of their basement punk show. Something clicked, and he kept photographing, the images developing in tandem with his writing. This first exhibition, Sống — Vietnamese for “to live” — captures the New England immigrant experience of Vuong’s writing, and more specifically the connection he forged with his brother, Nicky, in the wake of their mother’s death in 2019. The exhibition is accompanied by a sold-out artist book that reveals Vuong’s fluency with photo history — referencing figures from Nicéphore Niépce to Garry Winogrand to Raymond Meeks — and will make you cry by page three. Though he doesn’t state the obvious, the work participates in photography’s longstanding tradition of contemplating death, particularly the death of one’s mother.Ocean Vuong, \"Rose and Phuong (ii)\" (2009)Interestingly, Vuong’s portraits of Nicky are visually beautiful but at times verge on feeling a little trite — telling more than showing and posed in ways that feel familiar, as when he lies in a field at an angle that pointedly echoes that of the river behind him in \"Nicky after 12 hour shift\" (2025). \"Nicky (slide)\" too, is a perfectly composed photograph that captures the awkward melancholy of being no-longer-child but not-quite-adult, but its neatness arrests the weight of its subject matter. Photographing a loved one can be hard — painful, even — but some of these images are a little too frictionless, leaving the viewer at a distance.Indeed, what makes the rest of the work great is its particularity. Vuong has an eye for quotidian details that punch you in the stomach when stated plainly: the crumpled Dunkin’ Donuts bag framed by Buddhist statues in his mother’s nail salon, the hand grasping a doorway by a stickered whiteboard with five handwritten life goals. The fleeting ephemera of real people in real places and the quiet specificity of all they leave behind. Looking at Vuong’s gorgeously worn landscapes as a fellow New Englander who took up photography because of the pull I felt toward the postindustrial corners of my hometown, I was overcome with recognition. He captures the texture of those in-between places that are both rundown and lushly wild, their accumulation of a deep and unknowable history — the overgrown path, the graffitied brick building whose original purpose you can only guess at now. Vuong’s mother found his photographs sad (and so did mine), but I’ve always felt there was more to it than that. In the artist book, he captures it perfectly: “I ask the ghosts to show us what to make of their lives.”Ocean Vuong, \"life goals (i)\" (2021)Ocean Vuong, \"Nicky dumpster diving\"Ocean Vuong, \"Turners Falls\" (2024)Ocean Vuong, \"bridge, Turners Falls\" (2025)Ocean Vuong, \"sea bird\" (2024)Installation view of photographs by Ocean VuongInstallation view of Ocean Vuong: SốngOcean Vuong: Sống continues at the Center for Photography at Woodstock (25 Dederick Street, Kingston, New York) through May 10.

    "body": "\n    \n                Art Review\n                After a stint in 1950s New York, the LA-based artist abandoned abstraction and painting in favor of dreamlike, sexually charged drawings. \n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            John Altoon, “Untitled (ABS-52)” (1965), airbrush, pastel, and ink on board (all images courtesy Franklin Parrasch Gallery)\n    \n        \n            I first saw John Altoon’s paintings in 1984 at the now-defunct Edward Thorp Gallery. Since then, I have learned as much about him as possible, by both looking at his work and talking with people who knew him — particularly the poet Robert Creeley, who collaborated with him on an artist’s book and portfolio titled About Women (1966), and the dealer Nicholas Wilder, who first exhibited his work in 1965. I have long wondered why Altoon, a brilliant and beloved maverick in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and ’60s, who died at age 43 in 1969, has generally flown under the radar outside of California. John Altoon: Drawings, a small, thoughtful exhibition at Franklin Parrasch Gallery, offered some clues. While he lived in New York in the early 1950s and was in contact with the Abstract Expressionists, he returned to LA and eventually abandoned abstraction and painting in favor of dreamlike, sexually charged drawings. On this path, Altoon rejected the formalist belief that drawing hindered the evolvement of modern art, which was prevalent at the time. He further set himself apart by flouting decorum and working from dreams and imagination. John Altoon, \"Untitled (F-39)\" (1966), pastel on paperThe exhibition’s seven works, all done between 1963 and ’68, speak to the range of Altoon’s drawing practice and use of diverse materials. There are the linear, feverish, sexual figure drawings done in ink and graphite that still cause consternation among some viewers and institutions (even museums with works by Hans Bellmer in their collection). The women in Altoon’s drawings are often larger than the men. They’re not vying for male attention, and often seem to be looking inward. The men, all seemingly uniform and undistinguished figures, come across as helpless dweebs. Altoon does not provide a context, which would help locate the drawing in the realm of the imagination. His frenetic line work, resulting in an image that is not immediately decipherable, makes us conscious of our looking — he confronts us with our voyeurism, anticipating the internet and private chatrooms. His infusion of humor into the erotic adds a note of absurdity to it all.In “Untitled (ABS-81A)” (1966), Altoon depicts, in dark violet, a form that looks like the bottom half of an ostrich floating on a mottled ground of faint blue and green circles. Three bulbous, tan-inflected plumes radiate from the central form while a square in the middle of it, which we read as a screen, shows a red, linear nude whose pose recalls Gustave Courbet’s infamous “Origin of the World” (1866) and Marcel Duchamp’s unsettling nude in “Étant donnés” (1946–66). Seeing this on what could be a bird’s backside sends a jolt of weird humor through the drawing. Are we to focus on the whole image or the nude? It’s a question also raised by Courbet and Duchamp.John Altoon, “Untitled (ABS-81A)” (1966), ink on boardAltoon composed the more abstract “Untitled (ABS-52)” (1965) using an airbrush, pastel, and ink. Four overlapping, amorphous shapes outlined in red and khaki green sit atop a sunburst composed of blue and yellow rays. In each of the outlined shapes, he drew something that is palpable but still remains beyond comprehension — an invented thing.When Altoon died, he was just coming into the height of his powers. He had mastered drawing and color, worked in different media, including pastel and airbrush, and developed a constantly morphing vocabulary. His openness to dreams and imagination made his work unpredictable (as in the drawing of an ostrich’s backside as the container for a screen). This is what drawing makes possible. Altoon believed that it could still be inventive after Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Arshile Gorky. I love that he was right. John Altoon, \"Untitled\" (1963), pastel on boardJohn Altoon: Drawings continues at Franklin Parrasch Gallery (19 East 66th Street, Floor Three, Lenox Hill, Manhattan) through February 27.

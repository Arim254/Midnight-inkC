    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for addressing issues of censorship and inequality, Iranian artist Arghavan Khosravi (previously) has long utilized her bold, fragmented works to confront large-scale problems relevant around the world. Her alluring color palettes and delicate motifs catch the eye and are paired with distinct symbols of tension: a chain lock, cords binding body parts, and roiling flames.\nWhile her concerns are global, Khosravi has always considered her practice somewhat of a balm that helps her cope with trying times. And so the inward turn of her latest body of work perhaps ventures farther into this territory as she allows herself to delve deep into a personal and collective subconscious.\n\nThe past year has engendered a period of introspection, which the artist translates into a collection of smaller, altar-esque pieces. She refers to them as “intimate constructions where interior space carries its own symbolism. It’s been a way to move inward for a moment, allowing ideas to surface without a predetermined destination.” \nBoth the subconscious and symbolic have long figured prominently in her work, and recent pieces are similar. Many layer seemingly disparate components into surreal scenes, with recurring imagery of long, flowing hair, bright orbs of light, birds, and patterns from historic Persian architecture and design. Whereas earlier works frequently incorporated windows, doorways, and other portal-like structures, Khosravi’s newer pieces peer outward from inside, inviting the viewer into a new realm.\nThe artist is in the early stages of preparing for an upcoming solo show at Uffner & Liu in New York next year. Until then, follow her practice on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAfter six momentous leaps from a small aircraft, skydiver Gabriel C. Brown completed his mission. Brown is friends with astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy and now, also one of his collaborators. Together, the pair created a stunning image that shows the adventurous subject falling in front of the sun.\nMcCarthy is known for his incredible patience and planning, which has led him to capture an array of striking photos and composites detailing cosmic phenomena. This most recent piece, titled “The Fall of Icarus,” details the roiling, fiery surface of the sun with his friend’s upside-down silhouette. The pair undertook this project this past weekend in Arizona.\n\nLike much of his work, this image is a composite that stitches together a collection of high-resolution captures. McCarthy and Brown had to coordinate the jump and subsequent shots to reveal the latter’s free fall, footage of which they share on Instagram. \n“The Fall of Icarus” is available as a limited-edition print in McCarthy’s shop, where you can find more of his work.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLi Songsong (previously) has long centered his practice around translating archival imagery, whether it be a portrait printed in a newspaper or still from a film. The Chinese artist is broadly interested in the ways that memories morph over time and how, when we’re reflecting on a moment well in the past, our clarity over the particulars can be hazy.\nHis new body of work, History Painting, takes a similar technical approach, although rather than interpret a specific scene, Li ventures into the abstract. Wide, impasto layers of oil paint cloak the large-scale canvas, creating a cacophony of color and texture that seems to swell upward while simultaneously pulling downward. As a filmed studio visit shows, the artist works from top down, adding one thick mark atop another in a sort of grid. \n“History VII: Snake Year” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nPace Gallery, which represents Li, shares that History Painting reflects more on his relationship to the medium than any specific visual source, although, given his past work, it’s difficult not to try to find definition within the composition. The clustered ridges of paint, for example, might evoke bodies huddled together in mass, their backs to the viewer as they move toward an unknown destination. For Li, these brushstrokes, while abstract, do retain a sense of action and autonomy, and he describes them as “agentive and idiosyncratic” even as they’re covered again and again.\nHistory Painting is on view through December 20 in New York.\n“Revolution” (2025), oil on canvas, 210 x 210 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n“History IX: Mercy” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\n“History IV: Sacrifice” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArtist Andres Serrano with his exhibition \"Portraits of America\" at the Maillol Museum in Paris on April 24, 2024 (photo by Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, newly released by the House Oversight Committee this week, revealed an exchange between the deceased sex offender and artist-provocateur Andres Serrano.\nOn October 10, 2016, less than a month before Donald Trump was elected to the presidency for the first time, Serrano discussed his voting intentions with Epstein.\n“I was prepared to vote against Trump for all the right reasons,” Serrano wrote to Epstein. “But I’m so disgusted by the outrage over ‘grab them by the pussy’ that I may give him my sympathy vote.”\nIn the same email exchange, Serrano tells Epstein that he had just returned from Ireland for his exhibition Torture. The artist shares a photo of himself posing with a photograph from the eponymous series, depicting a hooded individual.\nSerrano has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s request for comment through a publicist and direct channels.\nSerrano, born in New York, rose to prominence in the late 1980s for “Piss Christ” (1987), a photograph of a crucifix that he submerged in his own urine that was included in an exhibition funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. The work upset conservative evangelists and members of Congress. He’d described the work as exploring “being drawn to Christ yet resisting organized religion.”\nEpstein posed in a portrait for Serrano in 2019, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor and only months before the disgraced former financier was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial. Serrano also photographed Trump in 2004.\nScreenshot of an email exchange between Andres Serrano and Jeffrey Epstein that was released by the House Oversight Committee\nIn 2019, the artist displayed his collection of 1,000 Trump memorabilia items at a gallery in Chelsea in the installation The Game: All Things Trump. Earlier this year, Serrano proposed a Trump altar for the United States pavilion at the Venice Biennale with the same title.\nIn July, when Hyperallergic asked Serrano through a publicist if he thought his Trump pavilion proposal met the State Department’s criteria of “non-political” character for the Biennale competition, he replied in a statement, “Of course, I’m not political. I don’t judge, I observe.”\nThough couched in the language of satire, Serrano’s artworks and public statements have often veered into offensive territory. Grantmakers for the Arts in 2022 labeled a recorded keynote address by Serrano with a content warning: “We acknowledge that some viewers may find Andres Serrano’s remarks hurtful and harmful. While Grantmakers in the Arts respects Serrano’s artistry, we do not endorse the views or tenor of his keynote remarks.”\nThe most recent trove of the so-called Epstein files sheds further light on Epstein’s art dealings and connections within the art world. \nIn one conversation, Epstein and journalist Michael Wolff discussed the provenance of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi,” which became the most expensive painting sold at auction when it fetched $450.3 million at Christie’s in 2017. It was consigned by Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev and reportedly purchased by Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, believed to be a proxy buyer for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman; the work’s whereabouts are currently unknown.\n“Is it a coincidence that the Russian who bought the house in Palm Beach and knows all, is the same guy who sold a painting last year to mbs for 450 million dollars,” wrote Epstein, according to the email exchange, referring to Rybolovlev, who purchased a Florida home once owned by Trump. “That was only worth 1.5m?” \n“So MBS was paying him off? Why? Ideas?” Wolff pressed. \n“reminder trump overuled congress on yemen,” Epstein responded, before adding that his “art guyd [sic] said the painting wasn’t very good.”\nHyperallergic has contacted Wolff for comment on the conversation.\nIn other emails from February 2017, Epstein discussed acquiring works from artists in Los Angeles and Berlin with an individual, Etienne Binant, who appeared to be advising him on collecting pieces. In one exchange, Binant assures Epstein that they “never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or anything of the kind” and promises to take Epstein only to artists’ studios or homes.\nWhen Binant asked if they were “still on,” Epstein wrote: “yes, lets [sic] start. . yes we are on. sorry with trump around it been very crazy busy.” \nHyperallergic has attempted to reach Etienne Binant for comment.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

The university made the change, despite receiving litigation threats from the campaign group Freedom in the Arts (FITA).\n\n\tThe 44-page document in question was “regularly reviewed and kept up to date”, the university told Arts Professional, following a series of updates last month.\n\n\tEarlier this year, in an August 7 letter, FITA threatened to sue the university over “misleading” guidance on furthering transgender inclusion in museums and galleries and demanded that it remove “Trans-Inclusive Culture” guidelines from its website. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tFITA’s argument echoes a ruling by the UK Supreme Court earlier this year, claiming that “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer only to biological women and biological sex.\n\n\tThe guidelines, which were published by the university’s Research Center for Museums and Galleries (RCMG) two years ago, offer a framework to “generate inclusive public spaces and workplaces.” It also addresses legal and ethical questions about trans inclusion.\n\n\tThe university guidelines are backed by the support of twenty-two cultural and heritage groups, including the International Council of Museums UK (ICOM UK) and the Association of Independent Museums (AIM).\n\n\tA second letter, sent by FITA on November 3, argues that the new guidance is “unlawful”, objecting to the guideline’s bathroom etiquette, which states, “trans visitors should be free to use the bathroom that they feel most comfortable using.”\n\n\tIn response, a University of Leicester spokesperson told Arts Professional, “The university is considering the latest correspondence from FITA, and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe HeadlinesSTAY CALM AND KARAT ON. As auction houses increasingly lean on the luxury market to offset sluggish art sales, Christie’s incoming global head of jewellery, Max Fawcett, is optimistic. The house kicks off its London Jewels sale on Friday, and he predicted it will be “one of the best London sales we’ve had in a long time,” crediting the strength of the pieces offered online, including period jewels worn by Alice, Viscountess Wimborne, in portraits by Sir Cecil Beaton, the Financial Times reports. Fawcett said the sale arrives during a “purple patch” for Christie’s jewellery division: in June, the company achieved its highest total for a various-owner sale in the Americas—$87.7 million in New York—following a sold-out Magnificent Jewels sale in Geneva in May. Fawcett, who officially steps into his new role on January 1, noted that while sales soared between 2012 and 2014 amid post-crisis exuberance, the following decade proved more challenging. Now, he believes the cycle has shifted again: “We’re having our moment.” Christie’s isn’t alone in its success. Heritage Auctions reached a record $9.2 million for a fine jewellery sale in September, while Phillips and Sotheby’s hosted major watch auctions in Geneva this week. Sotheby’s also reported record jewellery results this year in New York, Paris, and Milan. According to Quig Bruning, global head of jewellery at Sotheby’s, demand is now “significantly outstripping supply.”(ART) LENDING LIBRARY. The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) has launched an experimental art-lending program alongside its new exhibition, “Letters for the Future,” created with the artist-led Department of Transformation, Artnet News reports. It opened earlier this month and places works by 35 artists throughout the library’s Grand Lobby, encouraging visitors to encounter moving images, prints, and sculptural objects as part of their everyday library experience. Films by Asad Raza and Ilana Harris-Babou screen continuously, while Be Oakley/GenderFail Press presents a suite of 12 risograph prints accompanied by 10 downloadable, open-source typefaces. Several artists have contributed works that blur boundaries between art, ritual, and public engagement. The artist duo Hilma’s Ghost, comprised of Sharmistha Ray and Danielle Tegeder, contributed Enchantments: Bottled Devotionals of Divine Feminine Spirits (2023), a wooden apothecary box containing 12 glass spell jars. This piece functions simultaneously as an artwork within the exhibition and an object patrons can borrow and take home. In total, 20 artworks, including prints, magnets, banners, and original works on paper, are available for checkout.The DigestThis summer a team of archaeologists resumed their work on a site in southern Italy dating back to around 600 B.C.E., known for its three well-preserved Doric temples.

Irving Sandler, the celebrated art historian and critic, once said in the 1950s that “you could do the whole art world in an afternoon.” Back then, New York’s galleries were concentrated around 57th Street, making it easy to see everything in a single sweep. That era is long gone. Today, more than 700 galleries stretch across Chelsea, Tribeca, Chinatown, the Upper East Side, and parts of Brooklyn and Queens. The handwritten checklists people once used for weekend gallery crawls have largely been replaced by smartphone apps, the New York Times writes.

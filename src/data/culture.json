    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe inner crit­ic cre­ates writer’s block and sti­fles adven­tur­ous writ­ing, hems it in with safe clichés and over­think­ing. Every writer has to find his or her own way to get free of that sour­puss ratio­nal­ist who insists on stran­gling each thought with log­i­cal analy­sis and fit­ting each idea into an oppres­sive pre­de­ter­mined scheme or ide­ol­o­gy. William S. Bur­roughs, one of the most adven­tur­ous writ­ers to emerge from the mid-20th cen­tu­ry, famous­ly employed what he called the cut-up method.\nDevel­oped by Bur­roughs and painter Brion Gysin, this lit­er­ary take on the col­lage tech­nique used by avant-garde artists like Georges Braque orig­i­nat­ed with Sur­re­al­ist Tris­tan Tzara, who “pro­posed to cre­ate a poem on the spot by pulling words out of a hat.” The sug­ges­tion was so provoca­tive, Bur­roughs claims in his essay “The Cut-Up Method,” that cut-ups were there­after “ground­ed… on the Freudi­an couch.”\nSince Bur­roughs and Gysin’s lit­er­ary rede­ploy­ment of the method in 1959, it has proved use­ful not only for poets and nov­el­ists, but for song­writ­ers like David Bowie and Kurt Cobain. And any frus­trat­ed nov­el­ist, poet, or song­writer may use it to shake off the habit­u­al thought pat­terns that cage cre­ativ­i­ty or choke it off entire­ly. How so?\nWell, it’s best at this point to defer to the author­i­ty, Bur­roughs him­self, who explains the cut-up tech­nique thus:\nThe method is sim­ple. Here is one way to do it. Take a page. Like this page. Now cut down the mid­dle and cross the mid­dle. You have four sec­tions: 1 2 3 4 … one two three four. Now rearrange the sec­tions plac­ing sec­tion four with sec­tion one and sec­tion two with sec­tion three. And you have a new page. Some­times it says much the same thing. Some­times some­thing quite different–(cutting up polit­i­cal speech­es is an inter­est­ing exercise)–in any case you will find that it says some­thing and some­thing quite def­i­nite. Take any poet or writer you fan­cy. Here­say, or poems you have read over many times. The words have lost mean­ing and life through years of rep­e­ti­tion. Now take the poem and type out select­ed pas­sages. Fill a page with excerpts. Now cut the page. You have a new poem. As many poems as you like.\nBur­roughs gives us “one way” to do it. There may be infi­nite oth­ers, and it’s up to you to find what works. I myself have pushed through a cre­ative funk by mak­ing mon­tages from scraps of ancient poet­ry and phras­es of mod­ern pop, clichés ripped from the head­lines and eso­teric quotes from obscure reli­gious texts—pieced togeth­er more or less at ran­dom, then edit­ed to fit the form of a song, poem, or what­ev­er. Vir­tu­al cut-and-paste makes scis­sors unnec­es­sary, but the phys­i­cal act may pre­cip­i­tate epipha­nies. “Images shift sense under the scis­sors,” Bur­roughs writes; then he hints at a synes­the­sia expe­ri­ence: “smell images to sound sight to sound sound to kines­thet­ic.”\nWho is this method for? Every­one, Bur­roughs asserts. “Cuts ups are for every­one,” just as Tzara remarked that “poet­ry is for every­one.” No need to have estab­lished some exper­i­men­tal art world bona fides, or even call one­self an artist at all; the method is “exper­i­men­tal in the sense of being some­thing to do.” In the short video at the top, you can hear Bur­roughs explain the tech­nique fur­ther, adding his occult spin on things by not­ing that many cut-ups “seem to refer to future events.” On that account, we may sus­pend belief.\nAs Jen­nie Skerl notes in her essay on Bur­roughs, cut-up the­o­ry “par­al­lels avant-garde lit­er­ary the­o­ry” like Jacques Derrida’s Decon­struc­tion. “All writ­ing is in fact cut ups,” writes Bur­roughs, mean­ing not that all writ­ing is pieced togeth­er with scis­sors and glue, but that it’s all “a col­lage of words read heard over­heard.” This the­o­ry should lib­er­ate us from oner­ous notions of orig­i­nal­i­ty and authen­tic­i­ty, tied to ideas of the author as a sui gener­is, all-know­ing god and the text as an expres­sion of cos­mi­cal­ly ordered mean­ing. (Anoth­er sur­re­al­ist writ­ing method, the game of Exquis­ite Corpse, makes the point lit­er­al.) All that meta­phys­i­cal bag­gage weighs us down. Every­thing’s been done—both well and badly—before, Bur­roughs writes. Fol­low his meth­ods and his insis­tent cre­ative max­im and you can­not make a mistake—“Assume that the worst has hap­pened,” he writes, “and act accord­ing­ly.”\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow David Bowie, Kurt Cobain & Thom Yorke Write Songs With William Bur­roughs’ Cut-Up Tech­nique\nThe “Priest” They Called Him: A Dark Col­lab­o­ra­tion Between Kurt Cobain & William S.

    "body": "\n\tin English Language, History, Language |   \tDecember 29th, 2025  21 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt’s easy to imag­ine the myr­i­ad dif­fi­cul­ties with which you’d be faced if you were sud­den­ly trans­port­ed a mil­len­ni­um back in time. But if you’re a native (or even pro­fi­cient) Eng­lish speak­er in an Eng­lish-speak­ing part of the world, the lan­guage, at least, sure­ly would­n’t be a prob­lem. Or so you’d think, until your first encounter with utter­ances like “þat troe is daed on gaerde” or “þa rokes for­leten urne tun.” Both of those sen­tences appear in the new video above from Simon Rop­er, in which he deliv­ers a mono­logue begin­ning in the Eng­lish of the fifth cen­tu­ry and end­ing in the Eng­lish of the end of the last mil­len­ni­um.\nAn Eng­lish­man spe­cial­iz­ing in videos about lin­guis­tics and anthro­pol­o­gy, Rop­er has pulled off this sort of feat before: we pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured him here on Open Cul­ture for his per­for­mance of a Lon­don accent as it evolved through 660 years.\nBut writ­ing and deliv­er­ing a mono­logue that works its way through a mil­len­ni­um and a half of change in the Eng­lish lan­guage is obvi­ous­ly a thornier endeav­or, not least because it involves lit­er­al thorns — the þ char­ac­ters, that is, used in the Old Eng­lish Latin alpha­bet. They’re pro­nounced like th, which you can hear when Rop­er speaks the sen­tences quot­ed ear­li­er, which trans­late to “The tree is dead in the yard” and “The rooks aban­doned our town.”\nThe word trans­late should give us pause, since we’re only talk­ing about Eng­lish. But then, Eng­lish has under­gone such a dra­mat­ic evo­lu­tion that, at far enough of a remove, we might as well be talk­ing about dif­fer­ent lan­guages. What Rop­er empha­sizes is that the changes did­n’t hap­pen sud­den­ly. Non-Scan­di­na­vian lis­ten­ers may lack even an inkling that his farmer of the year 450 is talk­ing about sheep and pigs with the words skēpu and swīnu, but his final lines, in which he speaks of pos­sess­ing “all the hot cof­fee I need” and “friends I did­n’t have in New York” in the year 2000, will pose no dif­fi­cul­ty to Anglo­phones any­where in the world. Even his list of agri­cul­tur­al wealth around the ear­ly thir­teenth cen­tu­ry — “We habben an god hus, we habben mani felds” — could make you believe that a trip 600 years in the past would be, as they said in Mid­dle Eng­lish, no trou­ble.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nTrac­ing Eng­lish Back to Its Old­est Known Ances­tor: An Intro­duc­tion to Pro­to-Indo-Euro­pean\nHear the Evo­lu­tion of the Lon­don Accent Over 660 Years: From 1346 to 2006\nWhat Shakespeare’s Eng­lish Sound­ed Like, and How We Know It\nWhere Did the Eng­lish Lan­guage Come From?: An Ani­mat­ed Intro­duc­tion\nA Brief Tour of British & Irish Accents: 14 Ways to Speak Eng­lish in 84 Sec­onds\nThe Entire His­to­ry of Eng­lish in 22 Min­utes\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAs we reflect on 2025, we’re taking a peek into our archive to spotlight some of the stories we’re still thinking about. It’s a joy and a privilege to share so much creativity with you each day, and we’re grateful to know you’re out there reading. \nIn case you missed it, check out our favorite art books of the year. \n—Christopher, Grace, Kate, and Jackie\n“Bosch Beast No. 14” (2025), paper, paperboard, glue, wire, and crepe paper, 33 × 19 × 14 inches\nUncanny Papier-Mâché Creatures by Roberto Benavidez Mingle in ‘Bosch Beasts’\nFor Los Angeles-based artist Roberto Benavidez, the art of the piñata is a central tenet of a practice exploring intersecting themes of race, sexuality, humor, sin, and beauty. He draws upon the paper art form’s early religious significance in Mexico, when Spanish missionaries used a seven-pointed version as a tool for converting Indigenous people to Christianity. This motif, which appears in some of Benavidez’s distinctive sculptures, nods to its past colonial use.\n© Marcel Heijnen\nMarcel Heijnen Captures Loving Portraits of Feisty, Feral Felines in ‘City Cats of Istanbul’\nIn some parts of the world, stray animals are nearly as beloved as pets. Thousands of dogs roam the streets of Cusco, Peru, for example, and cats pretty much rule the night in places like Athens, Valletta, and Japan’s “cat islands.” Residents often feed and provide shelter for these roving colonies, and for Dutch photographer Marcel Heijnen, this human-animal connection provides endless opportunities to experience urban centers.\nFrom a performance by the Bavarian Junior Ballet\nEnjoy the Brilliant Ballet that Brought Dance to the Bauhaus Movement\nGiven the emphasis on functionality and design for industrial production, the Bauhaus movement is rarely associated with disciplines like dance. But for Oskar Schlemmer (1888-1943), translating its principles into movement and performance was as compelling as a well-conceived chair or building.\nBasket stars, a type of echinoderm, are abundant on seamounts and rocky outcroppings\nAmong Newly Discovered Ocean Species, a Baby Colossal Squid Is Filmed for the First Time\nAn archipelago in the South Atlantic known as the South Sandwich Islands is home to some of the most remote landmasses in the world. Uninhabited except for occasional scientific research, their volcanic makeup highlights the geological and ecological diversity of this part of the world, and we still have much to learn. In 2025, Schmidt Ocean Institute completed a 35-day trek on the Falkor (too) to the remote island chain and discovered new hydrothermal vents, coral gardens, and what researchers suspect to be entirely new species. During this expedition, the team also confirmed the sighting of a juvenile colossal squid, capturing one on film for the first time.\nFrance Leclerc, “Head Ball”\nBlink and You’d Miss the Moments Topping This Year’s Pure Street Photography Awards\nCoincidence is around every corner, and immortalizing a split second of fleeting chaos takes a special eye. Since 2020, Pure Street Photography—an initiative focused on connecting international photographers—has commended visual storytellers through an annual competition.\nLeft: Nick Cave and Bob Faust, “Wallwork,” (2024), wall vinyl, 157 x 367 1/4 inches. Right: Nick Cave, “A·mal·gam” (2021), bronze, 122 x 94 x 85 inches\nNick Cave’s Nearly 26-Foot Bronze Stands for Resistance Amid Oppression\nWhether weaving plastic pony beads into a monumental sculpture, adorning figures with mother-of-pearl buttons, or mosaicing ceramic tile across a New York subway station, Nick Cave has continually returned to one question: how does this material help bring people into the work?\nAlice Austen, “The Darned Club, October 29, 1891” \nMore than 7,500 Prints and Negatives by Trailblazing Photographer Alice Austen Return Home\nWith its panoramic views of New York Harbor, the house that trailblazing photographer Alice Austen (1866-1952) called home for most of her life is a sprawling, two-story, elegant Victorian Gothic waterfront property known as Clear Comfort. From here, she captured thousands of incredible photographs throughout her lifetime. In 2025, the entire archive of Austen’s photos returned to Clear Comfort after being held by a local historical society, thanks to a landmark acquisition.\nStephanie H. Shih, “Nuclear Family” (2024). Photo by Robert Bredvad\nThrough Ceramics, Stephanie Shih Considers the Disillusioning Price of Domestic Bliss\nNothing says true love like arguing about who left the cap off the toothpaste, right? From a darkly comedic perspective, Stephanie Shih explores the multiple meanings of “domestic bliss” in a social landscape fraught with consumerism and clashing politics.\nInstallation view of ‘Yuji Agematsu: 2023-2024’, 101 Spring Street, Judd Foundation, New York. Photo by Timothy Doyon, © Judd Foundation\nYuji Agematsu Arranges Street Debris into Tiny Daily Sculptures\nEach day, Yuji Agematsu takes a walk for the explicit purpose of scouring the streets. The dried leaf, lost toy, and even the wad of gum discarded on a park bench are his treasures, which he retrieves and places in the clear cellophane that wraps a pack of cigarettes. Although Agematsu no longer smokes, this habit of wandering and collecting has been harder to break: he’s been committed to it since 1996.\n“The Minotaur Room”\nNear Liverpool, a One-of-a-Kind Art Environment by Ron Gittins Is Saved\nBehind the unassuming red brick facade of a gable-roofed flat in Birkenhead, England, sits a home like no other. The only clue passersby would have had, until recently, was a pair of hand-sculpted figurative columns that flanked the wooden front door. But to step inside this corner flat near Liverpool is to be transported into the imaginative world of Ron Gittins.\n© Yuge Zhou, courtesy of Times Square Arts\nAcross 92 Screens in Times Square, Yuge Zhou’s ‘Trampoline Color Exercise’ Celebrates Global Unity\nSpanning a gridded background of rectangular, pink trampolines, hundreds of gymnasts mesmerizingly flip and twist, shapeshifting as they tuck and tumble. “Trampoline Color Exercise,” a monumental digital video collage installation by Chicago-based artist Yuge Zhou, takes a bird’s-eye view of athletes at peak form while abstracting their bodies and movements into undulating ripples of color.\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis past summer, Participant Inc., a Lower East Side art nonprofit, hosted an exhibition on Chloe Dzubilo, a trans woman who became an AIDS activist after contracting the disease. The show, curated by Alex Fleming and Nia Nottage, was immensely rich and important for both its historical and personal insights into the artist’s life. Through text-based works and drawings, the artist painted an intimate and sometimes painful picture of her experience living in subsidized housing for people with AIDS and discrimination at the hands of medical professionals. I reviewed the show with the hope that it would strike a nerve with readers from all walks of life who have experienced subpar healthcare, housing instability, and personal strife.It was one of a handful of New York shows this year that centered art by or about trans and gender-nonconforming people. At a moment when basic freedoms and legal protections for people who fall under the trans umbrella — even the right to be recognized — are being stripped away by the Trump administration, it’s encouraging to see some art institutions platforming artists such as Dzubilo. The art world’s support of work by or about trans and gender-nonconforming people seems to fly under the radar more than its support of many other marginalized groups. Last fall, I was able to sit in on a private conversation between two prominent artists I admire. Both identify as nonbinary and they discussed how, even in liberal circles, gender identity is often dismissed as a non-issue. Listening to them, I realized how true this often is in art and culture more broadly. I’m privileged to be in a position to help change this. This year I was grateful to raise the profile of some trans and nonbinary artists in my role as an editor and writer, and maybe to prompt some of the myriad conversations that can come out of their art.  The experiences that most stood out to me as an art critic and editor this year were those that brought attention to some of these exhibitions. In addition to my review of Dzubilo’s show, I was able to cover another historically significant show, Dueñas de la Noche: Trans Lives and Dreams in 1980s Caracas at the Institute for Studies on Latin American Art. Alexis Clements wrote about The Met’s Casa Susanna, while Emma Cieslik covered Spectrum of Desire: Love, Sex, and Gender in the Middle Ages at The Met Cloisters. Another great read is my colleague Lisa Yin Zhang’s review of Nayland Blake’s work at Matthew Marks Gallery. Through their writings, visual art, and performance, Blake has been a guiding light to LGBTQ+ artists (and others) for decades. Vaginal Davis, a pioneering LGBTQ+ artist whose work ranging from sculpture to punk music was the subject of a major survey at MoMA PS1, was covered here by Daniel Larkin.John Yau’s review of nonbinary artist Xingzi Gu’s paintings of androgynous figures illuminated the process and concepts behind the ethereal artworks. More pointed in their statements about identity but just as dreamlike was Hortensia Mi Kafchin’s recent show at PPOW Gallery, reviewed here by Cat Dawson, and Young Joon Kwak’s sparkling sculptures at the Leslie-Lohman Museum, reviewed by AX Mina.One of the year’s highlights was Tate Modern’s thorough and thoroughly compelling retrospective of Leigh Bowery, reviewed by Olivia McEwan. Bowery identified as a gay man, but his performances and handmade costumes, created amid 1980s London’s dazzling art underground, push gender-bending to new heights of complexity.Our writers covered plenty of other great shows this year, too: Aruna D’Souza’s incisive assessment of Duane Linklater at Dia Chelsea, Lori Waxman’s empathetic discussion of Chicago’s Red Line Service, a nonprofit that assists unhoused people, Carolina A. Miranda’s report on Chile’s 1980s punk underground, and Claudia Ross’s review of Burn Me at The Box in Los Angeles, which featured art and artists impacted by LA’s January fires. And I can’t sign off for the year without mentioning an exhibition that blew me away: Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg’s Only for the Wicked at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery was gorgeous and devastating.On a different note, make sure to read Senior Editor Valentina Di Liscia’s list of artworks that spoke truth to power in 2025.

Art acquisitions can say a lot about a person, but what can they say about an institution, where such decisions are often influenced by trustees and big-money donors? A great deal, it turns out.For instance, the Louvre did not own a single video artwork until this year, when Mohamed Bourouissa's piece documenting the Tuileries Garden made its way into the collection. Acquisitions also illustrate networks of power and exchange in the art world. One of Tate Modern’s big gets, a stunning Joan Mitchell triptych, came from none other than Miami-based developer and museum founder Jorge Pérez and his wife Darlene. We rounded up 15 museum acquisitions from 2025, including a moving tribute to trans and nonbinary life, sprawling collections of Indigenous and Latin American art, and even a Frank Lloyd Wright home.High Museum of Art — A Newly Discovered Jacob Lawrence PaintingLast exhibited publicly when it was created in 1943, this recently discovered watercolor is number 12 of 30 from Jacob Lawrence's Harlem series, portraying vignettes and moments from the New York City neighborhood. Lawrence is best known for The Migration Series (1940–41), an iconic 60-panel work that explores the migration of millions of Black Americans from the South, often considered his chef d’oeuvre. In \"Night (And then they go to sleep),\" the painter explores a more intimate yet no less poignant scene, depicting a Harlem family snuggled under a block-patterned quilt rendered in lush hues. The dreamy composition is slated to go on display at the High Museum’s American Art galleries in 2026 as part of the institution’s centennial programming.Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and Art Bridges Foundation — A Trove of Indigenous ArtDyani White Hawk's \"Tapun Sa Win\" (2017) is one of the works acquired by the Art Bridges Foundation in 2025 (image courtesy Art Bridges)Following an acquisition made in partnership with Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, Indigenous art now comprises one-third of the collection of the Art Bridges Foundation, an organization that lends works to museums across the country at no cost. Crystal Bridges and Art Bridges acquired nine and 81 artworks, respectively, from the John and Susan Horseman Collection, a move intended to increase visibility of contemporary Indigenous artists. Among the works now held by Art Bridges are Dyani White Hawk’s multimedia “Tapun Sa Win” (2017) and George Morrison’s painting “Traversal” (1958). In 2026, Crystal Bridges will display three of its new acquisitions, including TC Cannon’s “It’s A Good Day to Die” (1970).Tate Modern — A Revered Triptych by Joan MitchellJoan Mitchell, \"Iva\" (1973) (© Estate of Joan Mitchell, courtesy Tate)One of the most significant donations to London’s Tate Modern to date brings an enormous Joan Mitchell triptych down from the bedroom wall of collectors Jorge and Darlene Pérez to join the museum’s Rothko room. “Iva” (1973), named after Mitchell’s beloved German Shepherd, aptly encapsulates the artist’s monumental practice in Abstract Expressionism, though its palette and color-blocking are moodier than her more explosive works. Musée du Louvre — First-Ever Video Art AcquisitionMohamed Bourouissa, film still from Les 4 Temps (2025)(© Mohamed Bourouissa; courtesy Musée du Louvre)The Musée du Louvre has purchased French-Algerian photographer Mohamed Bourouissa’s Les 4 Temps (2025), a year-long project in which the artist observed and filmed the Jardin des Tuileries just beyond the museum palace. Compiled from 52 weekly videos closely examining the garden’s ecosystem, visitors, and care team, as well as day-to-day events and seasonal changes, Les 4 Temps is the first video artwork acquired by the Louvre, and is currently screening at the museum through January 19.  Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art — A Bronze Sculpture by Young Joon KwakYoung Joon Kwak, \"To Refuse Looking Away from our Trans-Temporal Bodies (Charlie)\" (2025) (images courtesy Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art)In poetic gestures that bear the trace of human experience, Young Joon Kwak creates alternative representations of queer and trans embodiment. This bronze, included in their solo exhibition at the Leslie-Lohman Museum in New York City this year, belongs to a series of evocative cast portraits of the artist's friends and collaborators. The sculpture's convex side depicts studio assistant Charlie's chest after top surgery, while the concave surface shows his chest pre-surgery, wearing a compression garment known as a binder. Kwak told Hyperallergic that the museum’s acquisition of the work is “a way of saying we’re here, we’ve always been here, and we’re not going anywhere.”“It means so much to me and to Charlie that other trans people can see another transitioning body as a counter-monument to all the other idealized bronze bodies, and know they’re not alone — now and long into the future,” Kwak said.Brooklyn Museum — An Impractical Instrument by Richard ArtschwagerRichard Artschwager, “Piano” (1965) (image courtesy Brooklyn Museum)The Brooklyn Museum has expanded its collection by 600 works this year. Among them is Barbara Bertozzi Castelli’s gift of a quintessential work by Richard Artschwager, whose thought-provoking practice bridged furniture design, painting, and sculpture without conforming to art-world trends. “Piano” (1965), crafted from wood laminated with Formica, toys with both dimensionality and decoration as it stands upright, outfitted with flat and functionless keys and pedals. The utilitarian finish becomes seductive, stimulating a fruitless urge to touch what’s inherently inoperable.Toledo Museum — The Oldest Known Kiddush CupThe Toledo Museum of Art purchased \"Cup of Joy,\" the oldest known Kiddush cup, in a Sotheby's sale (courtesy Sotheby's)In an October Sotheby’s auction, the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio purchased the oldest known Kiddush cup, a wine vessel used in Jewish tradition, for a reported $4 million in October. Dubbed the “Cup of Joy,” it is believed to have been produced in the 11th or 12th century around the Khorasan region in modern-day Central Asia, making it the oldest known Medieval Jewish artifact. Before Sotheby’s announced the sale, the silver cup had never been exhibited to the public. The acquisition coincides with a major renovation of the museum’s galleries, “expanding the narrative to highlight a wider range of artists,” according to the institution.The Getty Museum — A Hilma af Klint Watercolor LandscapeHilma af Klint, “A Sunlit Grove of Birch and Pine Trees” (c. 1903) (image courtesy Getty Museum) The J. Paul Getty Museum has added a watercolor and gouache forest scene by Hilma af Klint to its collection of 19th- and 20th-century landscapes this year. The Hilma af Klint Foundation retains ownership of nearly all of the late artist’s spiritually imbued artworks. As such, the acquisition of af Klint’s skillful and naturalistic “A Sunlit Grove of Birch and Pine Trees” (c. 1903) comes as a rare occurrence amid an ongoing argument about who controls the visibility, accessibility, and commercialization of her body of work.New York Historical — Bill Cunningham’s ArchiveA page from one of Bill Cunningham's scrapbooks (photo by and courtesy New York Historical)Through a gift from trustee Sally Klingenstein Martell, the New York Historical announced its acquisition of legendary street and fashion photographer Bill Cunningham’s archive from his estate this past summer. Equipped with his bicycle, a blue jacket, and his camera, the late fashion journalist was revered for spotting budding trends on the runways, at high-profile galas, and throughout the streets of New York City before they blossomed on the market. Cunningham’s archive, which comprises 50 years of photographs, notes, and sketches from his milliner days, as well as fashion show details scrawled from his time in Paris, among other items, reunites with several of his personal belongings at the Patricia D. Klingenstein Library.MALBA — Hundreds of Works by Latin American Art ArtistsBelkis Ayón, \"La cena\" (1993) (image via MALBA) A total of 1,233 works by 117 artists from Latin America and the Caribbean, including Belkis Ayón, Lygia Clark, Ana Mendieta, and Julio Le Parc, found a permanent home at the Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires (MALBA) with founder Eduardo F. Costantini's acquisition of the Daros Collection’s trove of art from the region. The purchase brings Jesús Rafael Soto, Carlos Cruz-Diez, and Doris Salcedo into MALBA’s holdings for the first time. Notably, it also elevates Colombia and Cuba to two of the most represented countries in the museum’s collection, alongside Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil.The Metropolitan Museum of Art — Scores of Dada and Surrealist WorksMan Ray's \"Le violon d’Ingres\" (1924) is among a large selection of Dada and Surrealist pieces gifted to the Met by trustee John Pritzker (photo Ian Reeves © Man Ray 2015 Trust / Artists Rights Society (ARS), courtesy Metropolitan Museum of Art) Man Ray’s image \"Le violon d'Ingres” (1924), featuring the bare back of model Kiki de Montparnasse marked by violin f-holes, will soon belong to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The piece is part of a promised gift of 188 Dada and Surrealist works by 37 artists from Met Trustee John Pritzker. They come from Pritzker’s Bluff Collection, which includes paintings and photographs by artists such as Ray, Marcel Duchamp, and Jean Arp. The gift also encompasses financial support for the Bluff Collaborative for Research on Dada and Surrealist Art, which is intended to serve as an interdisciplinary incubator for discussions on art and society.  Mississippi Museum of Art — A Home Designed by Frank Lloyd WrightThe Mississippi Museum of Art acquired a home known as \"Fountainhead\" by Frank Lloyd Wright. (photo G. Douglas Adams, courtesy Mississippi Museum of Art)With approval from the Jackson city council, the Mississippi Museum of Art purchased a single-family home designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, which had been listed for sale for a reported $2.5 million. Located in the city’s Fondren neighborhood, the home, called “Fountainhead,” was designed in 1948 for local oil businessman J. Willis Hughes. The Mississippi Museum of Art will open the property to the public via tours that can be booked in advance. The institution said the purchase would aid in its efforts to embed itself in the Jackson community. Los Angeles County Museum of Art — 17th-Century Painter Virginia Vezzi’s Self-PortraitThe Los Angeles County Museum purchased “Self-Portrait as St. Catherine of Alexandria” (c. 1624–26) by overlooked artist Virginia Vezzi. (image public domain via Wikimedia Commons)In April, the Los Angeles County Museum raised over $2.5 million for collection acquisitions during an annual two-day fundraiser. Among the six artworks purchased this year was “Self-Portrait as St. Catherine of Alexandria” (c. 1624–26) by the often overlooked painter Virginia Vezzi. Also known as Virginia da Vezzo, the artist’s career was largely eclipsed by that of her husband, Simon Vouet, who became the painter to the French King Louis XIII in the 1620s. Until recently, Vezzi’s artistic accomplishments in Paris and Rome — including her acceptance to the prestigious Accademia di San Luca and time spent teaching at the Louvre — were neglected by historians. Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris — Glimpses Into Henri Matisse’s Relationship With His Daughter\"Marguerite endormie\" (1920) is among the works by Matisse gifted to the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris. (public domain via Wikimedia Commons) The wife of Henri Matisse’s grandson, Barbara Dauphin Duthuit, gifted 61 artworks by the painter to the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris. The significant selection captures Matisse’s affections for his eldest daughter, Marguerite, who appears across decades of his work. The Parisian museum announced the acquisition following its exhibition Matisse et Marguerite, an exhibition of 110 works, including Matisse’s drawings and portraits, that portray vignettes of his daughter’s life, some of which had never before been on public view. Pérez Art Museum Miami — Guan-Hong Lu’s Apocalyptic AbsurdityGuan-Hong Lu, “Apocalypse Now: From Cradle to Grave” (2024) (image courtesy Nunu Fine Art)In an effort to expand the reach of its international and contemporary art collection, the Pérez Art Museum Miami acquired a painting from emerging Taiwanese artist Guan-Hong Lu. In “Apocalypse Now: From Cradle to Grave” (2024), Lu stages a searing, absurdist composition juxtaposing a faceless journalist reporting from outside of a burning banquet hall as a party continues, an armed individual whose identity is redacted, and two men at work despite the chaos unfolding. “Guan-Hong Lu touches on subjects that are universal but from the perspective of someone born in Taiwan — weaving his own personal history with images that can be interpreted and recognized by viewers around the world,” said Maritza Lacayo, associate curator at the museum, in a statement about the acquisition. \n                  \n                      \n                        Best of 2025\n                      \n                      \n                        Acquisitions\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tFrance’s Bayeux Tapestry is set to be covered by a UK Treasury guarantee of around £800 million ($1 billion) when it goes on loan to the British Museum in 2026.\n\n\tThat means British taxpayers will ultimately foot the bill to protect the 230-foot-long tapestry against damage or loss during its journey from France to the UK. It’s part of the UK government’s indemnity scheme, which acts as the insurer instead of paying for commercial insurance. However, nothing will be paid upfront; the £800 million is a contingent liability, only coming into play if something goes wrong.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe Treasury says the scheme has already saved UK museums about £81 million and has covered loans such as Vincent van Gogh’s The Bedroom (1888) at the National Gallery in 2024-25.\n\n\tUK ministers believe the risk of damage to the tapestry is very low, thanks to strict transport and display measures. The Treasury told the Financial Times it had “received an estimated valuation” of the tapestry, which has been “provisionally approved.” Sources expect the final figure to be roughly £800 million. While the Treasury didn’t dispute that, it refused to comment on the exact valuation.\n\n\tBefore the indemnity can go ahead, it needs approval from chancellor Rachel Reeves. It’s part of a broader cultural agreement between Britain and France, announced by President Emmanuel Macron during his state visit to London in July.\n\n\tNot everyone is happy about moving the nearly 1,000-year-old wool embroidery, though; some figures in the French art world are worried it could be damaged on the way to the UK.\n\n\tA recently released six-page agreement between the British and French culture ministries lays out exactly how the tapestry will travel and be displayed. It’s described as a “fragile and degraded thousand-year-old textile” and must be transported in a specially designed crate and displayed behind a protective screen. France will also oversee a trial run of the transfer using a replica fitted with vibration-monitoring equipment. Officials expect the tapestry to travel by truck via the Channel Tunnel.\n\n\tOnce it’s in London, the British Museum will take care of it until July 2027 and will fund a condition report when it goes back to Bayeux. George Osborne, former chancellor and now British Museum chair, has called it potentially “the blockbuster show of our generation,” comparing it to the Tutankhamun exhibition of 1972.\n\t\n\n\tThe tapestry, thought to have been made in 11th-century England, possibly by nuns, tells the story of the Norman invasion of 1066 in a comic-strip style. The museum expects the exhibition to generate plenty of merchandising revenue.\n\n\tThe loan will also coincide with restoration work at Bayeux. As part of the deal, British artifacts, including the Sutton Hoo treasures, will be sent to museums in Normandy in exchange.\n",

The indemnity values the 230-foot-long, nearly 1,000-year-old embroidery at more than twice the price paid for the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction, Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi, which sold for $450 million in 2017. The loan was agreed during President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit to the UK earlier this year, and the show is expected to be the British Museum’s largest-ever. Government backing is required because private insurance would be prohibitively expensive, ministers said. Some conservators have criticized the decision to move the fragile tapestry from Bayeux, fearing damage during transport. The tapestry will travel by truck through the Channel Tunnel and remain in London until July 2027, while its home museum undergoes renovation. In exchange, British treasures such as the Sutton Hoo artifacts will be loaned to France.\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t LGBTQ+  IN TIMES OF CONFLICT. London’s Imperial War Museum has been accused of sidelining Victoria Cross recipients in favor of highlighting transgender and wider LGBTQ+ history, the Telegraph reported. Its upper floor previously housed the world’s largest public display of Victoria Cross medals, Britain’s highest military honor, on loan from Lord Ashcroft. Earlier this year, however, the museum closed the gallery and returned the medals, prompting criticism that curators were shifting priorities. The museum has since launched a virtual, self-guided trail titled “Refracted Histories: Exploring LGBTQ+ Stories in Times of Conflict,” which examines LGBTQ+ experiences during wartime. Lord Ashcroft, who donated £5 million ($6.7 million) to open the gallery in 2010, said he was not warned of its closure and described the decision as “beyond parody.”The Digest\n\n\tTwo exhibitions in Germany are showing olfaction’s growing presence in the art world, with Artnet News asking, “Is smell the next big thing in art?” [Artnet News]\n\t\n\n\tThe Natural History Museum, one of London’s oldest museums, is planning to open two spaces, one of which has been closed to the public since World War II.

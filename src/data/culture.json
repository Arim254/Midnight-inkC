    "body": "\n\tin Psychology |   \tNovember 17th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn the two-thou­sands, the magi­cian-come­di­ans Penn and Teller host­ed a tele­vi­sion series called Bull­shit! In it, they took on a vari­ety of cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­na they regard­ed as wor­thy of the tit­u­lar epi­thet, from ESP to Area 51, exor­cism to cre­ation­ism, feng shui to haute cui­sine. Their sar­don­ic argu­ments were enriched by clips of assort­ed inter­vie­wees —speak­ing in defense of the top­ic of the day. Penn once addressed the view­ers, say­ing that we might won­der why any­one agrees to come on the show, giv­en how they must know it will make them come off. But every­one, he explained, con­fi­dent­ly believes that their own ideas are the cor­rect ones.\nThat episode came right to mind while watch­ing the new Ver­i­ta­si­um video above, which deals with the phe­nom­e­non of over­con­fi­dence. Like the oft-cit­ed 93 per­cent of Amer­i­cans who believe them­selves bet­ter dri­vers than the medi­an, we all fall vic­tim to that afflic­tion at one time or anoth­er, to one degree or anoth­er; the more inter­est­ing mat­ter under inves­ti­ga­tion is why that should be so.\nOne can always point to what T. S. Eliot called “the end­less strug­gle to think well of them­selves”: want­i­ng to believe that we know it all, we take pains to present our­selves as if we do. But as explained by the pro­fes­sors inter­viewed here, Carnegie Mel­lon’s Baruch Fis­chhoff and Berke­ley’s Don A. Moore (author of Per­fect­ly Con­fi­dent: How to Cal­i­brate Your Deci­sions Wise­ly), the research has also revealed oth­er poten­tial fac­tors in play.\nOne impor­tant can­di­date is, as ever, stu­pid­i­ty. Much has been made of the Dun­ning-Kruger effect, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, which holds that the less com­pe­tent peo­ple are at a task, the more con­fi­dent they tend to be about their abil­i­ty to per­form it. That would seem to accord with much of our every­day expe­ri­ence, but we should also con­sid­er the role played by the basic cog­ni­tive lim­i­ta­tions that apply to us all. Our brains can only process so much at once, and when they come up against capac­i­ty, they default to sim­pli­fied, and often too-sim­pli­fied, ver­sions of the prob­lem before them. It all becomes more dif­fi­cult if we’re insu­lat­ed from direct, objec­tive feed­back, a con­di­tion that often results from the kind of suc­cess and esteem that can be achieved by pro­ject­ing — you guessed it — con­fi­dence.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhy Incom­pe­tent Peo­ple Think They’re Com­pe­tent: The Dun­ning-Kruger Effect, Explained\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tNovember 17th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPunk rock and heavy met­al were two gen­res that evolved over the ‘70s, but seemed to run par­al­lel to each oth­er, despite shar­ing com­mon fash­ion, sounds, and atti­tudes. But then there are moments in his­to­ry, where every­body plays togeth­er in the same sand­box. For exam­ple, the above remas­tered audio, which cap­tures the Aus­tralian band AC/DC on their first Amer­i­can tour, play­ing New York’s CBGB, syn­ony­mous now with punk and new wave music.\nThe date is August 24, 1977, and AC/DC were on a cross-coun­try trip that had tak­en in both club dates and are­nas, where they supported—yes, hard to believe, I know—REO Speed­wag­on. Their album Let There Be Rock had just dropped in June. The band would be in the States until the win­ter.\nThis CBGB gig finds them on the same bill as Talk­ing Heads and the Dead Boys, accord­ing to a poster from the time. And while there’s no video for this show, you can find a few pho­tos that doc­u­ment the con­cert here. You can feel the mug­gy New York sum­mer in these pho­tos, but also the excite­ment of an unfor­get­table gig.\nAt 15 min­utes, the set is short, but still three min­utes longer than the Ramones’ first set at the same club three years ear­li­er. That’s pret­ty met­al, man.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nNYC’s Icon­ic Punk Club CBG­Bs Comes Alive in a Bril­liant Short Ani­ma­tion, Using David Godlis’ Pho­tos of Pat­ti Smith, The Ramones & More\nCBGB’s Hey­day: Watch The Ramones, The Dead Boys, Bad Brains, Talk­ing Heads & Blondie Per­form Live (1974–1982)\nLis­ten to Pat­ti Smith’s Glo­ri­ous Three Hour Farewell to CBGB’s on Its Final Night\nThe Talk­ing Heads Play CBGB, the New York Club That Shaped Their Sound (1975)\nWatch an Episode of TV-CBGB, the First Rock ‘n’ Roll Sit­com Ever Aired on Cable TV (1981)\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThrough dense thickets of florals rendered in watercolor and colored pencil, a woman attempts to find her footing. Enmeshed in vines and leaves, this nude protagonist can be seen cradling a child or tending to another matter, her surroundings obscuring the particulars of her body and actions.\nThese vibrant works are part of a semi-autobiographical series by Sarah Ann Weber, who marks two momentous occasions: the birth of her daughter and her move from Los Angeles, where she lived for a decade, to her hometown of Chicago. Titled I Know Her, this body of work refers to the artist herself, her child, and the stark differences between the two landscapes. \n“Wake up bright” (2025), watercolor and colored pencil on paper mounted to linen over panel, 36 x 48 inches\nWeber explores these significant changes through works teeming with growth. Whereas Los Angeles is dry and warm much of the year, Chicago cycles through all four seasons, sometimes seemingly within the same week. Contrasts between these locales arise through bright, tropical palettes alongside muted, winter fields in shades of gray and blue.\nWithin these lush atmospheres, splotches of watercolor and vivid florals subsume any definitive boundaries. Drawing on the traditions of window paintings and portraits depicting mother and child, the artist nests architectural structures and tender, familial moments within her largely botanical scenes. All seem to acquiesce to the rapidly evolving environment, nodding to the inevitability of change and renewal inside and out.\nI Know Her runs through January 10 at Anat Ebgi Gallery in Los Angeles.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDubbed “purgatory for artists,”  Quarantine is dedicated to finding freedom through constraint. The intensive residency program takes its name from its venue: an 18th-century lazaretto off the coast of Menorca, Spain.\nBuilt between 1793 and 1807, the fortress in the port of Mahón was a prison for sanitation, at which travelers would dock and be quarantined for a few weeks or until they recovered from disease. The facility closed about a century later, although the Gothic architecture and cemeteries that were once fundamental to its operations remain. Today, the secluded island is typically utilized as a tourist destination, event space, and the home of a mysterious residency.\n\nConceived in 2017 by artist Carles Gomilla, the residency program has always been experimental and emerged in various iterations before debuting in its current form in 2023 with partners Joan Taltavull, Itziar Lecea, and Darren Green. Gomilla is steadfast in his commitment to the ethos of Quarantine. Each spring and fall, he and his team invite about 60 people to the island, where they spend the week immersed in a rigorous program. The particulars of each edition are kept secret, and no phones are allowed.\nThis untethering allows a special kind of focus and a sense of communal vulnerability as everything that happens on the island, really does stay on the island (residents even have the opportunity to burn their work at the end of the week). The intention, the curators say, is to push artists to find their purpose, a task they undertake through a carefully crafted schedule. Gomilla is quick to make the distinction that Quarantine should not be thought of as a retreat but rather a training program, one that asks participants to stretch beyond their typical limits.\nResidents rotate between art labs and sessions with a slate of high-profile mentors—this upcoming edition includes artists we’ve featured on Colossal, Yuko Shimizu and Martin Wittfooth—with a variety of programming in the evening. The specifics of the art lab activities are always evolving, allowing for surprise and novelty with each day and each edition. Contrast is key, Gomilla says, as is risk. Although the structure of the program remains consistent, fewer than half of the activities and particular prompts are repeated. “I found that the more risky, the better it works,” Gomilla adds. “This is quite an incentive to change things every edition.”\nBecause the program isn’t prescriptive or focused on perfecting techniques or introducing theory, it functions as an inverse of the typical courses you’d find in an art school. The labs take cues from “art, education, psychology, and strategy,” Gomilla says. “I believe technique is extremely important, but we need to build something that complements it.” Instead, Quarantine focuses on mindset. “We push you to confront your fears, unlearn what’s restraining you, and rediscover the fire that makes you create,” a statement on its website says.\n\nWhile the program is focused largely on making visual works, it attracts people who might not identify first as artists. Lawyers, psychiatrists, and even a rescue dog trainer work alongside designers, art directors, and concept designers.\nThe theme of the upcoming edition is Tears in the Rain, a reference to the iconic monologue from Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. Detaching oneself from the work is a central intention, and like all of Quarantine’s editions, part of the philosophy its creators hope to foster.\nColossal will attend this spring’s program, from April 13 to 19, 2026. Find out more about joining us and the application process on Quarantine’s website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nUpon entering Cannupa Hanska Luger’s new exhibition, Dripping Earth at the Joslyn Art Museum, visitors find themselves, in a sense, underwater. Frames of bull boats sail overhead, referencing the small vessels that some Plains tribes historically used and orienting us within the context of the Joslyn’s location in Omaha along the Missouri River, the museum’s art collection, and Luger’s Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, and Lakota lineage.\nLuger is known for his interdisciplinary explorations of his Northern Plains ancestry through clay, sculpture, performance, textiles, video, and more. For Dripping Earth, the artist took inspiration from a source with a close connection to both the Joslyn’s holdings and his own observations of art in his youth: the work of Swiss artist Karl Bodmer (1809–1893).\n“Thunder as Remarkable Landscape” (2025) from the series ‘Future Ancestral Technologies,’ eight-color lithograph, edition of 7, sheet: 38 x 26 inches. Photo by Wendy McEahern, courtesy of the artist and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York\nBetween 1832 and 1834, Bodmer accompanied German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied on a North American expedition. Bodmer served as official documentarian, visually detailing the landscapes and people they encountered in numerous drawings and watercolors, many of which were later reproduced in Europe as lithographs. His portraits, which often emphasize ceremonial regalia, are a valuable record of Indigenous American tribal identity during this time.\nDrawn to the nature of artifacts—how, for instance, Bodmer’s work can become an artifact of an artifact within the context of printmaking and reproductions—Luger considers how narratives are both conveyed and received. When Bodmer’s paintings were translated into lithographs in the 19th century, the printmakers took liberties with “correcting” some of what they viewed as mistakes or incompletions, changing anatomical anomalies or missing details. But in some cases, these corrections weren’t actually a reflection of reality, which the original watercolors reveal.\nLuger is interested in how, over time, what is set into print becomes fixed, sometimes misconstrued, and inflexible. On the other hand, oral traditions like those of Northern Plains tribes are always evolving. For Dripping Earth, the artist focuses on this fluidity within the broader context of how American history is told.\n“As a Native person growing up in North America, you go to school, you learn the history of the country, and you have a contrary story,” the artist said during an opening talk for Dripping Earth. His ongoing series Future Ancestral Technologies is a way of collapsing time—of bringing both the past and the future together in a way that addresses how Indigenous American material and visual culture has been shown in museums—as something ancient, primitive, and dark, when in fact it is ever-present and always evolving.\n“Midéegaadi – Light” (2022) from the series ‘Future Ancestral Technologies,’ mixed-media bison regalia, installation dimensions variable. © Cannupa Hanska Luger. Photo by Brandon Soder, courtesy of the artist and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York\nFor this show, Luger scaled up, making some of his largest work to date. A monumental figure of steel and black clay looms over a number of ceramic vessels, carved wooden objects, and multi-media installations. A socially engaged work comprising steel poles with handmade clay beads also evokes a giant, three-dimensional abacus in the shape of a buffalo, illustrating data of wild buffalo returning to the plains. A few workshops facilitated by the museum invite visitors to create their own clay beads, which are then added to the sculpture to complete the animal’s form over time.\nCentral to Dripping Earth are a number of dancers sporting crocheted fabrics, padded gloves, and headdresses evocative of bison. These comprise Luger’s Midéegaadi series, the title of which is derived from the Hidatsa word for buffalo. A new group of limited-run prints combine these colorful figures—complete with Ben-Day dots that nod to the act of printmaking itself—with landscapes Bodmer sketched around the Missouri River region. \nInterestingly, although Bodmer made landscape paintings, too, the backgrounds of his portraits are typically left blank. Luger delves into how most 19th-century landscape painting of so-called “virgin territory” simply left out the presence of the Indigenous people who already lived there. “Oh, but we were there!” Luger says. Bodmer’s paintings are almost like the landscapes in reverse, with emphasis only on people. For a new series of Midéegaadi prints, Luger incorporates Bodmer’s landscapes into the background.\nNotably, many of the landforms the Swiss artist chronicled are now submerged in the Missouri River following the construction of major dams. But Luger considers this to be a part of a bigger story, in which these land forms—created by the river—weren’t “lost” but instead reclaimed by it. Which brings us again to how we approach Luger’s show, as though moving through a timeless, watery realm representative of the past, present, and future all at once—a speculative future that brims with the past.\nKarl Bodmer, “Leader of the Mandan Beróck-Óchatä,” watercolor and graphite on paper, 17 × 11 15/16 inches.

White (2019)\nLuger’s Midéegaadi dancers have made a number of appearances throughout 2025, including a large-scale installation for Times Square’s nightly Midnight Moment public art program. The video work took over more than 90 giant LED screens in the Manhattan intersection throughout the month of April, running for three minutes starting at 11:57 p.m.\nLast month, one character called “Midéegaadi – Fire” also debuted in an unsanctioned digital group exhibition called ENCODED in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s American Wing, during which the figure danced across Thomas Cole’s 1836–37 painting “View on the Catskills – Early Autumn” in an augmented reality performance.\nDripping Earth continues through March 8, 2026, in Omaha. And ENCODED runs through December 21 in New York City.

Photo: Olympia Shannon)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nUman’s practice is interdisciplinary and ever-evolving. Comprising painting, drawing, murals, mosaic, sculpture, and glass, her work is rooted in the tangibility of color and the transportive power of images. Shaped by memories, dreams, and the constant flux of life around her, Uman’s visual language is intuitive and multilayered, adaptable and free; it is neither exclusively abstract nor metaphorical — it grows out of what is indeterminate and into the transcendent. Her many inspirations range broadly, from her childhood in East Africa and diasporic experiences in Europe and the US to a love for textiles and transcontinental fashion. Her subject matter evokes the flamboyant fabrics worn by women in Somali bazaars, the slanted flourishes of Arabic calligraphy taught in madrasas, and the vast countryside of Kenya and Upstate New York.\nOn view at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, through May 10, 2026, Uman: After all the things … includes new and recent paintings, works on paper, video, and a sculpture. Created with oil, acrylic, spray paint, oil stick, and even sometimes incorporating elements of collage and sewing as well, Uman’s compositions dance with animated hues and phantasmagoric patterns. Working on many pieces simultaneously, Uman builds her pictorial arrangements — many of which reference 19th-century French painting, surrealism, and visionary abstraction alongside the natural world — with energetic mark-making methods, using dry brushes and even her fingers and palms, resulting in surface treatments that disrupt the conventional distinction between paintings and drawing. Fusing art history with autobiography and spirituality with reality, Uman’s work pursues the metaphorical through a close attention to, and reverence for, the natural world.\nUman: After all the things … is accompanied by the artist’s first museum publication, co-published by Gregory R. Miller & Co., featuring an essay by the curator, images of the work on view, and installation images.\nFor more information, visit thealdrich.org.\nUman: After all the things … is organized by Amy Smith-Stewart, Diana Bowes Chief Curator.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

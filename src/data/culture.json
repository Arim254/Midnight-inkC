    "body": "\n\tin Life, Psychology |   \tOctober 17th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry so far may seem light on major tech­no­log­i­cal break­throughs, at least when com­pared to the twen­ti­eth. An arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence boom (per­haps a bub­ble, per­haps not) has been tak­ing place over the past few years, which at least gives us some­thing to talk about. Before that, most of us would have named the smart­phone, for bet­ter or for worse, as the defin­ing devel­op­ment of our time. Relat­ed­ly, we could also zoom out and declare that humankind has elim­i­nat­ed bore­dom. But unlike, say, get­ting rid of small­pox, that achieve­ment has yield­ed mixed bless­ings at best. The rea­son is that, as Har­vard Busi­ness School pro­fes­sor Arthur C. Brooks puts it in the Har­vard Busi­ness Review video above, you need to be bored.\n“Bore­dom is a ten­den­cy for us not to be occu­pied oth­er­wise, cog­ni­tive­ly, which switch­es over our think­ing sys­tem to use a part of our brain that’s called the default mode net­work,” Brooks says. In that mode, which kicks in absent any oth­er stim­u­la­tion, we must face “big ques­tions of mean­ing” — by their very nature, uncom­fort­able ones — in our lives. “One of the rea­sons we have such an explo­sion of depres­sion and anx­i­ety in our soci­ety today is because peo­ple actu­al­ly don’t know the mean­ing of their lives, much less so than in pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions.” What has insu­lat­ed us so com­plete­ly from the need even to con­sid­er it? Why, “that thing in your pock­et with the screen, which you take out even when you’re stand­ing on the street cor­ner, wait­ing for the light to change.”\n“We all have pock­et-sized com­put­ers now,” wrote the jour­nal­ist Kaleb Hor­ton, who died last month, in a blog post from ear­li­er this year addressed to his own father in the nine­teen-eight­ies. “You can look up ency­clo­pe­dia arti­cles and stuff but you’ll most­ly use it for check­ing the stock mar­ket and play­ing a game called Can­dy Crush. It’s real­ly just some­thing to do with your hands, like cig­a­rettes.” To those suf­fer­ing the kind of strange malaise he sens­es beset­ting so many of us here in the hyper-con­nect­ed twen­ty-twen­ties, he offers rec­om­men­da­tions includ­ing the fol­low­ing: “Log off as hard as you can. Go out­side, talk to peo­ple in real life where it’s actu­al­ly kind of rude to talk about the news, try to actu­al­ly see the friends you usu­al­ly just text mes­sage. Go for a long dri­ve and turn the phone off while you do it. Get back into your hob­bies or pick one and learn it for a while.”\nIn oth­er words, get offline and “try out some of those nor­mal things you hear about and if you get bored that’s won­der­ful because we’re not sup­posed to get bored any­more. It turns out bore­dom is the Cadil­lac of feel­ings.” With­out it, we’re liable to find our­selves on the way to the junk­yard: “If every time you’re slight­ly bored, you pull out your phone,” Brooks says, “it’s going to get hard­er and hard­er for you to find mean­ing, and that’s the recipe for depres­sion and anx­i­ety and a sense of hol­low­ness, which, by the way, are all through the roof.” If you delib­er­ate­ly and reg­u­lar­ly go with­out check­ing your phone, or indeed expos­ing your­self to any oth­er source of elec­tron­ic stim­u­la­tion, you’ll build “the skill of bore­dom,” which will enable you not only to con­front life’s grand ques­tions, but also to be less bored with ordi­nary life — some­thing we should all learn to savor while we still can.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Ben­e­fits of Bore­dom: How to Stop Dis­tract­ing Your­self and Get Cre­ative Ideas Again\nLyn­da Bar­ry on How the Smart­phone Is Endan­ger­ing Three Ingre­di­ents of Cre­ativ­i­ty: Lone­li­ness, Uncer­tain­ty & Bore­dom\nHow to Take Advan­tage of Bore­dom, the Secret Ingre­di­ent of Cre­ativ­i­ty\nDavid Lynch Explains How Med­i­ta­tion Boosts Our Cre­ativ­i­ty (Plus Free Resources to Help You Start Med­i­tat­ing)\nBored at Work?

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne of the most iconic figures of the mid-20th century, trailblazing Japanese-American artist Ruth Asawa led a prolific life of art-making, advocacy, and civic engagement. Over a decade after her passing, the last year has ushered in a momentous wave of exhibitions for Asawa—appearing at David Zwirner in her first solo exhibition in Greater China, followed by two major showings of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective.\nIn a tale of two MoMAs, the enormous exhibition recently traveled from its point of origin in San Francisco, where the artist fostered a deep, lifelong connection to the city. Its arrival in New York City now marks the largest show dedicated to a woman artist in the museum’s history. \nPhotograph by Laurence Cuneo. © 2025 Ruth Asawa Lanier, Inc., courtesy of David Zwirner\nFeaturing more than 300 of Asawa’s artworks spread across a whopping 16,000 square feet, the expansive collection documents the artist’s six-decade-long career. You can expect to get a close look at her groundbreaking wire sculptures, intimate paintings, drawings, and prints, as well as bronze casts and monumental public works.\nRuth Asawa: A Retrospective opens at the Museum of Modern Art on October 19, where it will be on view until February 7, 2026.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetail of Moses Ros, “Echoes of Nature” (2025), acrylic on canvas\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nBorn in New York City in 1958, the Bruce Museum’s 2025 artist-in-residence, Moses Ros, has always found that nature offers inspiration for his art. In HUMAN / NATURE — produced in response to the exhibition Blanche Lazzell: Becoming an American Modernist (Bruce Museum, February 6–April 27, 2025) — Ros marshals color and its absence to call attention to issues around environmental loss. Like Lazzell, whose white-line woodcuts fracture the world into chromatic planes separated by contours of exposed white paper, Ros divides his compositions into a series of amorphous, interlocking forms. Across his paintings, mobiles, and sculptures, this brilliantly colored, camouflage-like pattern is punctuated by cut-outs of recognizable wildlife, making further reference to Lazzell’s signature white-line approach.\nWhile the luminous hues that pervade the show at the Bruce Museum communicate Ros’s joyous appreciation of nature, they also act as a secondary form of camouflage, obscuring the darker realities that underlie his work. Developed in the service of war and hunting, camouflage mimics and manipulates the appearance of the landscape to conceal the destructive forces lying in wait. As a result of these and other human interventions, the species Ros depicts here — the passenger pigeon, dodo bird, and the regal fritillary butterfly, among others — are either endangered or already extinct. By positioning viewers within an immersive environment of the artist’s making, this exhibition seeks to celebrate nature’s beauty while also revealing humanity’s irrevocable impact on the natural world.\nAbout the ArtistMoses Ros is a sculptor, painter, and printmaker of Dominican descent who lives and works in New York City. He creates artworks to lift the human spirit, using bright colors, dynamic shapes, and interactive elements. Ros has had solo exhibitions at the Sugar Hill Museum, the Bronx Museum of the Arts, and the Yeshiva University Museum in New York, as well as the Paterson Museum in New Jersey. He has also exhibited in the Yoryi Morel Gallery of the Institute of Culture and Art in Santiago, Dominican Republic.\nRos has received several public sculpture commissions from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, the Bronx Council on the Arts, and the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority. His artwork is part of public and corporate collections, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, El Museo del Barrio, and the AT&T Collection.\nTo learn more, visit brucemuseum.org.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

(image courtesy CajaGranada Fundación)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA miniature gouache painting by Pablo Picasso has gone missing in Spain, according to CajaGranada Fundación, a cultural center and museum in Granada. \nIn a statement shared with Hyperallergic, the institution said that its staff discovered that Picasso’s “Naturaleza muerta con guitarra (Still life with a guitar)” (1919) was missing from a shipment of items for an upcoming exhibition. The painting, about the size of an iPhone SE at 5 by 3.9 inches (12.7 by 9.8 centimeters), had been expected by the museum from a private collection for its exhibition Bodegón: La eternidad de lo inerte (Still Life: The Eternity of the Inert), which opened on October 9.\nHowever, when unpacking a delivery of works for the exhibition originating from Madrid on October 6, just three days before the exhibition’s opening, the institution said its curator and exhibition manager discovered that the Picasso painting, reportedly worth €600,000 (~$700,500), was not among the items.\nA delivery company, the institution said, had arrived days earlier on October 3, and the packages sat over that weekend under video surveillance, which showed no disruption. The statement did not name the company.\nAt 10 am on October 3, the museum said its staff met a van carrying the works and instructed them to bring them inside in a single forklift transfer. The works were then moved from the van to a freight elevator into an area with video surveillance. According to the museum, the packages arrived improperly numbered, so a thorough check of the works was impossible without unpacking everything. Before the delivery employees left an hour and a half later, the museum said staff checked the provenance information on the packages, but did not verify the works physically before dismissing the individuals who delivered the packages.\nThe Spanish newspaper El País reported that two individuals were on board the van and stopped overnight not far from Granada. Nobody has been arrested yet, according to the El País, and police are focused on determining at what point during the journey the work disappeared. It is unclear if the painting was initially confirmed to have been on the delivery van.\nIn its statement, CajaGranada Fundación said that it filed a report with Spain’s national police and will cooperate in the investigation. Hyperallergic has not yet heard back from the Policía Nacional.\nPicasso’s work has long been targeted by thieves, including in a 2012 heist at a Dutch museum in which “Tête d’Arlequin” (1971) was swiped. In 2019, a French court found that the Spanish artist’s electrician and his wife had stolen 271 Picasso paintings and kept them hidden in their garage for 40 years. \n“We have filed a report of the disappearance with the National Police; we have made all our resources available for the investigation, fully confident that the proceedings will proceed smoothly and resolve the case,” the museum said in its statement.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

Wood’s portrait both references and complements Aidan Zamiri’s photos of Charli XCX for the singer’s October cover story with the magazine. (image courtesy Issy Wood/Vanity Fair)\n“I don’t really get to decide when [brat]’s over or not,” Charli XCX told Contributing Editor Anna Peele during an extended interview for Vanity Fair‘s cover story this month — “I think that’s up to the world.” If VF has a say, brat (2024) and the career evolution it has imposed on the singer and producer are still relevant over a year later, especially since the magazine commissioned contemporary artist Issy Wood for a portrait of the British pop star for the cover of its first art issue in 20 years publishing this November.\nThough Charli is intentionally absent from the award-winning album’s iconic, retina-singing green and blurry text cover art, Wood brings her front and center again in a simultaneously fuzzy and edgy oil portrait on equally shocking orange velvet. Depicting Charli from her cupid’s bow to the crown of her head, the painter captures the arched brows and hooded eyes of the party princess’s lethal stare piercing from beneath her buoyant waves. \nFor the portrait, the American-born British painter told VF that she drew from “the length and quality of [Charli’s] career prior to the global success of brat, the throwaway candor of her lyrics, [and] the Britishness we both share.” But not without adding her own flourishes of yellow twinkles and sweeping white lines that loop and bounce across the singer’s face, elements that walk the line between a fun Instagram face filter and doodles on the margins of one’s ruled notebook and push a surreal intimacy throughout the painting.\nWood’s portrait both references and complements Aidan Zamiri’s photos of Charli XCX for the singer’s October cover story with the magazine.\n\nIssy Wood, “Charli 2” (2025) (© Issy Wood 2025;  photo by Damian Griffiths, courtesy the artist, Carlos/Ishikawa, London, and Michael Werner Gallery)\nWood, who also produces her own music in addition to her established visual arts practice, appears to understand at its core what Charli XCX means when she pronounces that “Everything is Romantic.” Perhaps not necessarily through “bad tattoos on leather-tanned skin,” as the singer emphasizes on the track, but in other similarly quotidian yet captivating sights and scenes: canker sores and tightened braces, rippling back muscles and shiny challah bread, car interiors and shiny revolvers.\nHer paintings, some of which are currently on view through January in a solo show at Schinkel Pavilion in Berlin, flutter between alluring and unsettling as they tap into forgettable moments and sensations, buried desires or suppressed fears, and curiosity beyond one’s control.\nWood noted to the magazine that it was a challenge to capture one of the most famous faces of the 2020s compared to the nature of her own practice, but accepted any labels of the work reading as fan art because that is “one of the purest and most tender art forms we have.” \nLike Wood, Charli herself is markedly expressing interest in new artistic endeavors, from establishing herself and the fans who attended her impromptu album remix concert at Storm King Art Center last year as “fine art bitches now” to going on to star in forthcoming films.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

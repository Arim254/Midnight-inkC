    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tDecember 24th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOne can hard­ly con­sid­er the Christ­mas sea­son for long, at least in the Eng­lish-speak­ing world, with­out the work of Charles Dick­ens com­ing to mind. That owes for the most part, of course, to A Christ­mas Car­ol, the novel­la that revived the pub­lic cul­ture of a hol­i­day that had been falling into desue­tude by the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry. What­ev­er its lit­er­ary short­com­ings, the book offers a host of mem­o­rable images, not least culi­nary ones: Mrs. Cratchit’s pud­ding, for instance, which Dick­ens likens to “a speck­led can­non-ball, so hard and firm, blaz­ing in half or half-a-quar­tern of ignit­ed brandy, and bedight with Christ­mas hol­ly stuck into the top.”\n\n\n\t\n\nIn the Tast­ing His­to­ry video at the top of the post, host Max Miller teach­es you how to make just such a hol­i­day pud­ding — and indeed a fig­gy one, a con­fec­tion whose name we all rec­og­nize from no less a stan­dard car­ol than “We Wish You a Mer­ry Christ­mas,” even if we don’t know that pud­ding, in the Vic­to­ri­an sense, refers to a kind of cake.\nThe fig­gy pud­ding Miller makes from an orig­i­nal 1845 recipe looks, and seems to taste, more like an alco­hol-soaked ver­sion of the fruit­cakes many of us still receive come Christ­mas­time. Despite its rep­u­ta­tion for lead­en unde­sir­abil­i­ty, rein­forced by decade after decade of John­ny Car­son gags, the fruit­cake has a rich his­to­ry, which Miller reveals in the video just above, and culi­nary strengths beyond its extreme shelf life.\n\n\n\t\n\nThis playlist of 20 Christ­mas-themed videos offers many more such delights: Turk­ish delight, for instance, as well as Vic­to­ri­an sug­ar plums, medieval gin­ger­bread, and his­tor­i­cal ver­sions of such still-com­mon com­forts and joys as eggnog and pump­kin pie. And if you’ve ever won­dered to what was­sail — as a noun or a verb — actu­al­ly refers, have a look at the video above, in which Miller explains it all while mak­ing a pot of the stuff, which turns out to be a kind of apple­sauce-enriched ale. Was­sail, too, is a favorite Dick­ens ref­er­ence, and not just in A Christ­mas Car­ol. His first nov­el The Pick­wick Papers includes a Christ­mas feast with “a mighty bowl of was­sail, some­thing small­er than an ordi­nary wash-house cop­per, in which the hot apples were hiss­ing and bub­bling with a rich look, and a jol­ly sound, that were per­fect­ly irre­sistible”: the kind of image that, near­ly two cen­turies lat­er, still makes read­ers want to go a‑wassailing.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nEudo­ra Welty’s Hand­writ­ten Eggnog Recipe, and Charles Dick­ens’ Recipe for Hol­i­day Punch\nTry George Orwell’s Recipe for Christ­mas Pud­ding, from His Essay “British Cook­ery” (1945)\nCharles Min­gus’ “Top Secret” Eggnog Recipe Con­tains “Enough Alco­hol to Put Down an Ele­phant”\nHow Eat­ing Ken­tucky Fried Chick­en Became a Christ­mas Tra­di­tion in Japan\nTast­ing His­to­ry: A Hit YouTube Series Shows How to Cook the Foods of Ancient Greece & Rome, Medieval Europe, and Oth­er Places & Peri­ods\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tDecember 25th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nIt will no doubt come as a relief to many read­ers that San­ta Claus appears to have been a Union sup­port­er. We know this because he appears dis­trib­ut­ing gifts to sol­diers from that side of the Mason-Dixon in one of his ear­li­est depic­tions. That illus­tra­tion, “San­ta Claus in Camp” (above), first appeared in the Harper’s Week­ly Christ­mas issue of 1862, when the Amer­i­can Civ­il War was still tear­ing its way through the coun­try. Its artist, a Bavar­i­an immi­grant named Thomas Nast, is now remem­bered for hav­ing first drawn the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty as a don­key and the Repub­li­can Par­ty as an ele­phant, but he also did more than any­one else to cre­ate the image of San­ta Claus rec­og­nized around the world today: more than Nor­man Rock­well, and more, even, than the Coca-Cola Com­pa­ny.\n\nSan­ta Claus is an Angli­ciza­tion of Sin­terk­laas, a Dutch name for Saint Nicholas, who lived and died in what’s now Turkey in the third and fourth cen­turies, and who’s been remem­bered since for his kind­ness to chil­dren. Few of us would rec­og­nize him in his por­trait from 1294 that is includ­ed in the Pub­lic Domain Review’s pic­to­r­i­al his­to­ry of San­ta Claus, but with the pass­ing of the cen­turies, his images became mixed with those of oth­er fly­ing, win­ter-asso­ci­at­ed char­ac­ters from Ger­man­ic and Norse myth. In 1822, Clement Moore per­formed a defin­ing act of rhyming syn­the­sis with his poem “A Vis­it from St. Nicholas” (often called “ ‘Twas the Night Before Christ­mas”): in its vers­es we find the bun­dle of toys, the rosy cheeks, the white beard, the bel­ly shak­ing like a bowl full of jel­ly.\n\nNast clear­ly under­stood not just the appeal of Moore’s descrip­tion, but also the char­ac­ter’s pro­pa­gan­da val­ue. His very first ren­di­tions of San­ta Claus appear in the upper cor­ners of an 1862 Harper’s Week­ly illus­tra­tion of a pray­ing wife and her Yan­kee sol­dier hus­band. Near­ly two decades lat­er, Nast drew the car­toon “Mer­ry Old San­ta Claus” (imme­di­ate­ly above), whose cen­tral fig­ure remains imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able to us today, even as its moti­vat­ing polit­i­cal cause of high­er wages for the mil­i­tary has become obscure. In the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, the icon­ic Father Christ­mas would be enlist­ed again to lend pub­lic sup­port to U.S. efforts in World War I and II, in the very decades when Rock­well was fur­ther refin­ing and cement­ing his image in pop­u­lar cul­ture. The once-unlike­ly result was an Amer­i­can San­ta Claus: “the sym­bol of our empire,” in the words of The New York­er’s Adam Gop­nik, “as much as Apol­lo was of the Hel­lenic one.”\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch San­ta Claus, the Ear­li­est Movie About San­ta in Exis­tence (1898)\nDid San­ta Claus & His Rein­deers Begin with a Mush­room Trip?: Dis­cov­er the Psy­che­del­ic, Shaman­is­tic Side of Christ­mas\nHear “Twas The Night Before Christ­mas” Read by Stephen Fry & John Cleese\nJ.

Around me are those cutting wreaths down to size, taking selfies, begging their parents for a bigger tree, and lugging them away. Despite the cold, the uncertainty, the relentlessness of the news cycle, it makes me feel grounded, in community — which is what the holiday season is about. I'd like to take a moment to thank you for being part of our community, whether you are a reader, a subscriber, or a paid member.We're in an interesting time of the year — not just the holiday season, but also that in-between time when we've elected a new mayor, but he hasn't been sworn in. It's the season for gratitude, but if I know anything about New York, it's that it always looks forward. In that spirit, I beseech you to read Sami Abu Shumays's open letter to the next mayoral administration. One stat I simply can't get over: The city currently gives The Met more money each year than every single institution in Queens and Staten Island combined. Let's see city government put our money where its mouth is. Wherever you're headed this week, whether you're just hopping on the subway or taking a flight, we hope it's absolutely lovely.

Crucially, Shumays emphasizes that he's not asking for special carve-outs for artists — funding culture more equitably is part and parcel of the general affordability reforms Mamdani's championing.

    "body": "\n            Welcome to the 317th installment of A View From the Easel, a series in which artists reflect on their workspace. This week, artists make work alongside their daughter and draw inspiration from local museums.Want to take part? Check out our submission guidelines and share a bit about your studio with us through this form! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.Daniel McCoy Jr., Española, New MexicoHow long have you been working in this space?Four years.Describe an average day in your studio.I wake around 5:15am. I wake up my family and animals. We leave the house around 7, and I drive 35 miles south up to Santa Fe. I return around 9:15am from dropping my Wife Topaz, who is a teacher, son Levon, and daughter Fia at three separate schools. I begin painting around 10am. Music and coffee play an important role at this time. I work until 2:30pm then repeat the process. We will usually do something for dinner, and then I will work until late into the evening. Especially if there is a time-sensitive project that I am working on.How does the space affect your work?This is a comfortable space connected to my home. The important issue is that there is beautiful scenery outside that allows a connection to nature. Throughout the day, I see the sunrise, sunset, view the mountains, and view the stars. How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?I am near Santa Fe, which has a thriving art scene with many galleries and museums to visit for historic art. I live between the Tewa Pueblos nearby and at times I get to view what my friends are creating. I visit the gallery I am represented by, Hecho a Mano, a few times each month to gather inspiration from the current shows. My wife and I are both involved in education in the arts, so we see the beginnings of artistic growth. Plus, I have the best friends a guy could ever have, and they are all artists.What do you love about your studio?It holds my favorite books, my favorite instruments, and all my ideas. What a fortunate human I am. I am very grateful. What do you wish were different?More space, more machines, and woodworking tools. An outside area for carving. The elevation is pretty high here in the mountains and the summer sun can get pretty hot.What is your favorite local museum?SITE Santa Fe. I have had the opportunity to work with the team on various shows over the years. Very special people to me.What is your favorite art material to work with?Oil-based paints. Particularly One Shot Enamel on large surfaces. Keri Arlotta, Oakwood, OhioHow long have you been working in this space?One year.Describe an average day in your studio.A cozy, creative corner in my house is where I find myself with my easel. If I were to zoom out, you could see my four-year-old's toys surrounding my sacred corner of creativity. Her laughter and music from the bijou television above my fireplace mantle echoes amongst the walls. Beside my studio space is a large grid picture window and beyond the window, large colorful foliage illuminates colors into my zone that are so profound and beautiful. The sounds, the sights, and the peace I find here allow me to open new doors within myself. I stand, rarely sit, as I begin blending colors beside my easel. A fresh canvas awaits me and the tone of my space provides a peace within me that allows me to connect to the depths within myself. How does the space affect your work?My space is full of love and light and when I get to soak into that ambience, I am able to tap into a steady flow of creativity.How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?Oakwood is a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. Within Oakwood, large trees consume the city. It’s easy to get lost in a trail, especially in fall, as the leaves die and the colors of dying leaves captivate us. Just a few minutes down the street I am a member and frequent observer at The Contemporary Dayton. I also enjoy checking out work at The Dayton Art Institute and Rosewood Arts Centre.What do you love about your studio?I love the natural light I’m provided with in my studio. I love that the walls in my space are filled with the trials and errors of my own curiosity. I enjoy that my studio is in the heart of my home, where all the things I love gather. I'm exploring the depths of myself here while I witness my daughter explore depths of her own imagination around me. What do you wish were different?Space. I cannot stress this enough. I have a creative corner, but I often imagine what limitations the size of my studio space provides. If I had more space, maybe I could get my hands on different techniques, textures, etc. Or if I had space for a larger canvas, what could I bring to life there? What is your favorite local museum?Dayton Art Institute.What is your favorite art material to work with?Acrylics on canvas.\n                  \n                      \n                        Community\n                      \n                      \n                        A View From the Easel\n                      \n                  \n        ",

His influential shadow boxes, lovingly composed from mementos, curios, images clipped from their literature, and ordinary or ephemeral objects that he came across, became dimensional worlds of wonder that laid the foundations for assemblage and installation art.The source material of those worlds, squirreled away in storage boxes or stacked on nearly every surface in Cornell's basement studio at his home along Utopia Parkway in Queens, is reconvened in a new devotional exhibition that recreates the late artist's workspace. Gagosian curator Jasper Sharp and filmmaker Wes Anderson co-developed the exhibition at the gallery's storefront location in Paris, the city Cornell knew intimately and deeply longed for, but ultimately never visited.

Now, through Anderson's fastidious eye and exhibition designer Cécile Degos's expertise, The House on Utopia Parkway has reunited some of Cornell's most noteworthy shadow boxes with his meticulously restaged studio filled with over 300 original objects he collected over his lifetime. Works including “Pharmacy” (1943),  “A Dressing Room for Gille” (1939), and “Flemish Princess” (c. 1950) physically command visitors' attention as they sit below eye level on scrappy wooden tables up front. In the background, dozens upon dozens of cardboard boxes labeled in Cornell's painted lettering are crammed into a ceiling-high bookshelf. At another corner of the studio below shelves of collected curios, inspirational ephemera are haphazardly strewn across a table equipped with a typewriter, wood glue, ink jars, and a painted wooden parrot, among other needful tools.

In an ultimate act of appreciation for the artist's practice, The House on Utopia Parkway itself becomes a shadow box, viewed only through the windows of Gagosian's softly lit storefront. The exhibition is free to visit at Gagosian's rue de Castiglione location in the city's 1st arrondissement.

They jaunt through her stories, printed on pages and quilts, their bright, succinct language as engaging as their visual counterparts. The late artist was a storyteller and visual artist in equal measure — her knack for prose and her herculean visual skills go hand in hand. She utilized craft to experiment with form, medium, and message, challenging the parameters of fine art, demanding equal attention for her textiles and her striking canvases. I was first introduced to Ringgold as a girl, through her children’s books. Cozied into library nooks, I read Tar Beach (1991), her tale of a Harlem girl dreaming of flight. Years later, her work can conjure in me similar feelings of joy, which re-emerged this November when I saw her current exhibition at Jack Shainman Gallery. Her story quilts and prints drew me in, featuring poems and stories that resurfaced the nostalgic sensation of appreciating history and learning through art, again awed by Ringgold’s aptitude for braiding the visual and narrative arts.Installation view of Faith Ringgold at Jack Shainman Gallery. Pictured: Two works from Jazz Stories quilt series (2004–7) (© Faith Ringgold, courtesy the Anyone Can Fly Foundation and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York. Photo Dan Bradica Studio)Born in 1930 in New York City, Ringgold was a child of the Harlem Renaissance.  This is evident in her artworks, stylistically informed by the politics and aesthetics of the landmark cultural era. Her affinity for Black history at large — its music, literature, and art — appears with regularity across her oeuvre. Her 1973 Slave Rape series comprises gutting interpretations of sexual violence, based on the likenesses of Ringgold and her daughters, painted on tapestries inspired by Tibetan thangkas. Her Jazz Stories quilts (2004–7) honor the music genre’s creative power, depicting sensuous clubs swirling with smoke and stages led by curvaceous women rapt in song. On quilts dominated by black, red, and green, she honored the words and likenesses of revolutionary luminaries Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, and Martin Luther King Jr. Faith Ringgold, \"Coming to Jones Road Part II #4 Aunt Emmy and Uncle Tate\" (2010), acrylic on quilted fabricIn her Coming to Jones Road series, developed over a decade, from 1999 to 2010, Ringgold adeptly tackled the topic of domestic life under enslavement and emancipation. Iterations from this mixed media series appear across the galleries. Some wordless, and others integrating brief but mighty tales, they are a highlight of the exhibition. Text circles the perimeter of “Coming to Jones Road Part II #4 Aunt Emmy and Uncle Tate” (2010). “Aunt Emmy could be in two places at the same time — outback cuttin up wood for the fire and tendin to them kids stirrin up trouble in the field and Uncle Tate could vanish in a flash and show up in the same way,” Ringgold wrote. “Well one day they just up and walk to freedom an nobody see ’em go. Not nobody. Nobody. Not nobody but Jesus.” It’s a work of profound microfiction — fantastical, concise, and haunting. On paper and fabric, Ringgold returned to these narratives of a family blighted by slavery but buoyed by love, centered on Aunt Emmy and Uncle Tate, and their journey to freedom on the Underground Railroad. Also on view is one of Ringgold’s famed story quilts, always a delight to behold, relating funny and heart-wrenching accounts in a colloquial, stream-of-consciousness tone. “The Bitternest #3: Lovers in Paris” (1987) follows two ill-fated lovers, from their meeting to their demise. It packs a punch in 14 panels, amusing, erotic, romantic, and tragic all at once. Ringgold’s hybrid text-and-image artworks reach inside of you and require a response, whether titillation, empathy, or something else. She was generous with her gifts, at times witty in her social commentary, sometimes scathing in her critique, periodically self-reflective, and always innovative. Through her creative lives as author, illustrator, painter, quilter, sculptor, and activist, she deployed potent personal and political messages that speak to the urgency, vulnerability, and tenderness of life. Ringgold responded and reacted to the world around her, conjuring new, emotive ways to tell stories as a Black artist.Faith Ringgold, \"Study for Coming to Jones Road: Under a Blood Red Sky #1\" (n.d.), marker and acrylic on paper (© Faith Ringgold, courtesy the Anyone Can Fly Foundation and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York.

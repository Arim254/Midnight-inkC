Look, I know New Year’s resolutions are a cliché, but I want to share mine with you: This year, I’m going to finish my thesis. I completed coursework for my master’s degree in Art History years ago and wrote about half of my thesis before letting other projects, and plain old exhaustion, push it down the priority list. This made me feel guilty, and the guilt became another deterrent. Every time I sat down to write, a sense of shame loomed over the work ahead like a slowly expanding ink blot. Any writer or artist will know this feeling quite well. Yet we find a way to keep going.This week, Hyperallergic’s reporters and contributors authored pieces that spoke to resilience and momentum, like critic Seph Rodney’s moving review of a Hew Locke exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art. In Locke’s suspended sculptures of vessels, loaded with cargo as though “plucked from the sea mid-journey,” Rodney sees how vestiges of the past carry into the present. The show, he writes, “is about transitions, movement, both to and from what we might recognize as our home shores.”We also looked back at a legacy and found insights for the future. Spanish artist Cecilia Giménez, who died this week at 94, left not just the world’s most beloved botched restoration, but also the remarkable lesson that what might seem like a mistake could turn into your life’s most beautiful surprise. That’s a bit of wisdom we can all lean into — including us thesis writers …And on we go. Thank you as always for reading. — Valentina Di Liscia, senior editor\nNewsPiet Mondrian, “Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow” (1930) (photo via Wikimedia Commons)Dozens of works of art, film, literature, and music entered the public domain on January 1, including a historic painting by Piet Mondrian and Betty Boop's debut appearance.

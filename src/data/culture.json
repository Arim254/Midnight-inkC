    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tNovember 10th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nIn addi­tion to the icon­ic scene in Jim Henson’s Labyrinth, or appear­ances in ani­mat­ed TV shows and video games, M.C. Esch­er’s work has adorned the cov­ers of albums like Mott the Hoople’s 1969 debut and the spec­u­la­tive fic­tion of Ita­lo Calvi­no and Jorge Luis Borges. A big hit with hip­pies and 1960s col­lege stu­dents, writes Heavy Music Art­work, his mind-bend­ing prints became asso­ci­at­ed with “ques­tion­ing accept­ed views of nor­mal expe­ri­ence and test­ing the lim­its of per­cep­tion with hal­lu­cino­genic drugs.” While he appre­ci­at­ed his cult fol­low­ing, Esch­er “did not encour­age their mys­ti­cal inter­pre­ta­tions of his images.” Reply­ing to one enthu­si­as­tic fan of his print Rep­tiles, who claimed to see in it an image of rein­car­na­tion, Esch­er replied, “Madame, if that’s the way you see it, so be it.”\n\nRather than illus­trate high­er states of con­scious­ness or meta­phys­i­cal enti­ties, Bruno Ernst writes in The Mag­ic Mir­ror of M.C. Esch­er, the artist intend­ed to cre­ate prac­ti­cal, “pic­to­r­i­al rep­re­sen­ta­tion of intel­lec­tu­al under­stand­ing.” Illus­tra­tions, that is, of philo­soph­i­cal and sci­en­tif­ic thought exper­i­ments. The son of a civ­il engi­neer, Esch­er began his stud­ies in archi­tec­ture before mov­ing to draw­ing and print­mak­ing.\nThe chal­lenge of cre­at­ing built environments—even seem­ing­ly impos­si­ble ones—always seemed to occu­py his mind. Along with themes from the nat­ur­al world, a high per­cent­age of his works cen­ter on buildings—inspired by for­ma­tive ear­ly years in Rome and his admi­ra­tion for Islam­ic art and Span­ish archi­tec­ture.\n\nIn the 50s and 60s Escher’s art piqued the inter­est of aca­d­e­mics and math­e­mati­cians, an audi­ence he found more con­ge­nial to his vision. He cor­re­spond­ed with sci­en­tists and incor­po­rat­ed their ideas into his work, mean­while claim­ing to be “absolute­ly inno­cent of train­ing or knowl­edge in the exact sci­ences.” In the 50s, Esch­er “daz­zled” the likes of math­e­mati­cians like Roger Pen­rose and HSM Cox­eter. In turn, notes Maev Kennedy, he “was inspired by Penrose’s per­spec­ti­val tri­an­gle and Coxeter’s work on crys­tal sym­me­try.”\n\nFor all the excite­ment he cre­at­ed among math­e­mati­cians, it took a bit longer for Esch­er to get noticed in the art world. When Penrose’s uncle showed Escher’s ver­sion of the per­spec­ti­val tri­an­gle to Picas­so, “Picas­so had heard of the British math­e­mati­cian but not of the Dutch artist.” Escher’s fame spread out­side of the sci­ences in part through the inter­ests of the coun­ter­cul­ture. He may have shrugged off mys­ti­cal and psy­che­del­ic read­ings of his prints, but he had an innate pen­chant for the mar­velous­ly weird (see his copy of a scene, for exam­ple, from Hierony­mus Bosch, above, or his sur­re­al print Grav­i­ty, below).\n\nSee the prints pic­tured here and a few dozen more dig­i­tized in high res­o­lu­tion at Dig­i­tal Com­mon­wealth, cour­tesy of Boston Pub­lic Library, who scanned their Esch­er col­lec­tion and made it avail­able to the pub­lic. Zoom into the fine details of prints like Inside Saint Peter’s, fur­ther up—a fine­ly ren­dered but oth­er­wise not-espe­cial­ly-Esch­er-like work—and the labyrinthine Ascend­ing and Descend­ing at the top. Whether—as Har­vard Library cura­tor John Over­holt confesses—you’re a “nerd who loves M.C. Esch­er” for his math­e­mat­i­cal mind, an artist with a mys­ti­cal bent who loves him for his hal­lu­ci­na­to­ry qual­i­ties, or some mea­sure of both, you’ll find exact­ly the Esch­er you’re look­ing for in this dig­i­tal gallery.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2018.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEnter an Online Inter­ac­tive Doc­u­men­tary on M.C.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tNovember 10th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs many as a mil­lion peo­ple crossed the Gold­en Gate Bridge on foot to cel­e­brate the 50th anniver­sary of its con­struc­tion in 1987. More than a few of them would have remem­bered San Fran­cis­co as it was before it had its most icon­ic struc­ture — and indeed, some would even remem­ber walk­ing across it once before, on its inau­gur­al “Pedes­tri­an Day” in 1937. Bar­ring the pos­si­bil­i­ty of unusu­al­ly vig­or­ous super­cente­nar­i­ans, that won’t be the case 12 years from now, on the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s 100th anniver­sary. But we’ll still be able to appre­ci­ate the enor­mous ambi­tion of its builders, not least its chief design engi­neer Joseph Strauss, who, along with Charles Alton Ellis, made pos­si­ble a project long assumed impos­si­ble.\nThe video from Sabin Civ­il Engi­neer­ing at the top of the post explains every stage of the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s design and con­struc­tion. Build­ing a sus­pen­sion bridge over the Gold­en Gate, the deep strait between San Fran­cis­co Bay and the Pacif­ic Ocean, posed for­mi­da­ble chal­lenges. The dis­tinc­tive shape we know from so many pho­tographs emerged in part from the need to anchor the bridge in such a way as to bal­ance out the mas­sive forces that would oth­er­wise bend its tow­ers inward, and the steel-on-steel con­struc­tion of its sus­penders and deck was nec­es­sary to pre­vent cat­a­stroph­ic crack for­ma­tion.\nThe deck hangs from 250 pairs of cables, and each of the main cables that run the length of the bridge actu­al­ly con­sists of 27,000 steel wires wound togeth­er. A sys­tem of ther­mal expan­sion joints accom­mo­dates reg­u­lar elon­ga­tion and shrink­age of near­ly four feet.\n\n\n\t\n\nAnd we haven’t even got into the under­wa­ter blast­ing and ter­ri­fy­ing-look­ing drilling work required to put up the tow­ers in the first place. In any case, the painstak­ing efforts of the engi­neers and labor­ers alike have sure­ly been vin­di­cat­ed by the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s func­tion­al­i­ty and pop­u­lar­i­ty over the past 88 years. Nat­u­ral­ly, it’s had to under­go con­sid­er­able main­te­nance and retro­fitting in that time, and it would take a true roman­tic to ignore its lim­i­ta­tions entire­ly. (Take its lack of rail capac­i­ty, which was nei­ther tech­ni­cal­ly nor eco­nom­i­cal­ly fea­si­ble to incor­po­rate dur­ing the Great Depres­sion.) Still, when 300,000 peo­ple jammed them­selves onto its deck at once on its 50th anniver­sary, it may have bent in the mid­dle, but it did­n’t break. That was a tes­ta­ment to the civ­il engi­neer­ing acu­men of Strauss and com­pa­ny — but let’s hope the cen­te­nary fes­tiv­i­ties are bet­ter orga­nized.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n“The Bay Lights,” the World’s Largest LED Light Sculp­ture, Debuts in San Fran­cis­co\nThe 5 Inno­v­a­tive Bridges That Make New York City, New York City\nHow the Brook­lyn Bridge Was Built: The Sto­ry of One of the Great­est Engi­neer­ing Feats in His­to­ry\nA Mes­mer­iz­ing Trip Across the Brook­lyn Bridge: Watch Footage from 1899\nWhy There Isn’t a Bridge from Italy to Sici­ly – And Why the 2,000-Year-Old Dream of Build­ing the Bridge May Soon Be Real­ized\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for her perplexing compositions of domestic interiors, Cinta Vidal continues to mesmerize with a new body of paintings at Thinkspace Projects. The artist’s solo show, Inward, continues her exploration of what she describes as “un-gravity constructions,” in which space and time appear folded or warped.\nIn Vidal’s dizzying compositions, people occupy different areas of invented apartments and homes. Perhaps each tableau represents a different period of time; perhaps they are parallel universes. “For Vidal, depicting macro and micro levels of inverted apartment buildings and city structures illustrates the various ways the world is experienced by a mass population,” the gallery says.\n“Flat” (2025), acrylic on wood, 31.5 x 31.5 inches\n“The word ‘inward’ speaks to both layers of interiority: the shared indoor spaces we inhabit and the private, inward-facing state we enter when we disconnect from what surrounds us,” Vidal says. A sofa, for example, can be a place of togetherness or quiet retreat. “These scenes reflect that subtle coexistence: being together, yet each within their own space,” she adds.\nInward continues through November 29 in Los Angeles. And as a complement to the exhibition, Vidal painted a new mural on the side of a local frame shop called Sherman Gallery in Marina del Rey. See more on the artist’s website and Instagram.\n“Side by Side” (2025), acrylic on wood, 23.6 x 23.6 inches\n“Meet Up” (2025), oil on wood, 31.5 x 31.5 inches\n“Condominium” (2025), acrylic on wood, 31.5 x 31.5 inches\n“Bond” (2025), oil on wood, 27.5 x 27.5 inches\n“Brerhen” (2025), oil on wood, 27.5 x 27.5 inches\n“Sofascape 1” (2025), acrylic on wood, 35.4 x 35.4 inches\n“Attic” (2025), acrylic on wood, 31.5 x 31.5 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAt the Center for Art & Advocacy, a solo exhibition by Gilberto Rivera meditates on the material conditions of both confinement and liberation. Jailbirds presents a series of mixed-media collages that map the prison cell onto wood panel, with a variety of avian species as their protagonists.\nIncarcerated for two decades himself, Rivera draws on the concept of recidivism and the derogatory term for someone who’s habitually imprisoned. He invokes a sort of cyclical migration pattern that entraps people and returns them to carceral facilities again and again. The titles of the works—”Jailbird #12″ and “Jailbird #13,” for example—similarly nod to the dehumanization of the penal system, which refers to people as numbers rather than their names.\n“Jailbird #12” (2022), acrylic, mixed media, and collage on wood, 38 1/2 x 39 5/8 x 2 inches\nGiven their ability to fly, birds are often symbols of freedom, with a special status reserved for the eagle as the national emblem of strength and pride in the U.S. On the other hand, fowl are also kept in cages when domesticated or bred for consumption or commercial use, making the creatures an apt representation of incarceration.\nIn Jailbirds, Rivera presents parrots, herons, pelicans, pigeons, and others in architectural environments teeming with activist imagery. Snippets of magazines, newspapers, protest signs, archival footage, and even text clipped from an Instagram story cover the walls of each cell, transforming the otherwise austere concrete-and-steel setting into a space of possibility.\nFor many people inside, world-building of the kind the artist visualizes is a necessary act of survival. Books, magazines, and other materials are often passed from one person to another with imagery displayed within the cells as a stark contrast to the drab interiors. Liberation, for Rivera, is rooted in both this act of creation and the material conditions that make up our lives, whether inside or out. Through his layered, typographic paintings, he envisions the possibilities of imagination within confinement and the fundamental need to create the world we want to live in.\nJailbirds, Rivera’s first solo exhibition, is on view in Brooklyn through February 15.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 2016, a high school student in Charlottesville, Virginia, launched a petition to remove a number of statues from public view. These included Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, Thomas Jefferson, and others, a majority of which a businessman named Paul Goodloe McIntire commissioned in the early 20th century. Over time, these monuments were seen as glorifications of men who furthered Manifest Destiny and condoned slavery, and they continued as emblems of white supremacy.\nWhen the Charlottesville city council approved removing some statues, counterprotestors filed a lawsuit to keep them. And in 2017, during a Unite the Right rally, tensions grew deadly when a man accelerated his vehicle into a group of people, killing one and injuring dozens. The tragedy was an inflection point, but the statues remained until the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, spurred by George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, again amplified the conflict on a national scale.\n\nIn July 2021, 100 years after its initial unveiling, Charlottesville removed the sculptures of Lee and Jackson. The former was melted down, and the latter was deeded to artist Kara Walker by way of a Los Angeles nonprofit called The Brick. It’s here, as part of the exhibition MONUMENTS, that Walker has boldly re-envisioned the statue as a potent symbol of transformation.\nWalker is known for making work, often on a large scale, that engages with symbols and stereotypes of racism. Her monumental piece “A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby,” installed in a former Domino sugar factory in Brooklyn in 2014, comprised a giant sculpture of a woman-sphinx. \nWith a kerchief evocative of Aunt Jemima, viewers were face-to-face with an architectonic, stereotypically racist interpretation of Southern Black women, especially the notion of the “mammy,” a loyal servant. Walker turned the tables on this image, monumentalizing her into not only a giant decorative confection but also a deity.\nFor the piece at The Brick, Walker similarly transfigures a symbol of oppression into a compelling, retributive, enigmatic form. “At 13 feet high and 16 feet long, the bronze statue portrayed Jackson spurring his steed, ‘Little Sorrel,’ into the heat of battle,” says a statement.\n\nThe reimagined statue, “Unmanned Drone,” dissects the original sculpture created by artist Charles Keck into an unsettling, Hieronymus Bosch-like composition. “Altered beyond recognition, it is, however, still horse and rider,” the gallery says. “Instead of charging into battle, Walker’s headless horseman wanders in Civil War purgatory, dragging its sword over a ruined battlefield.”\nThe Brick is curated by Hamza Walker—no relation to Kara—who has been collecting decommissioned Confederate monuments from cities around the U.S. Today, the statue of Jackson takes an entirely new form, recontextualized in a way that spins the power to harm into the power to heal. Taken apart limb by limb and reconstructed into a surreal, fragmented, spectral reflection on how the past is woven into the present, Walker contends with the relationship between history and legend.\nThe title, “Unmanned Drone,” refers simultaneously to aircraft controlled remotely and a kind of low, humming, almost physical sound. The artist is interested in the way that, like a device flying overhead or a deep, reverberating sound, the sculpture also “presses on you…it looms.”\nIn an interview with Hamza Walker, Kara describes the impetus for memorial statues as rooted in myth. These sculptures are “all about these sometimes misapplied desires—a desire for heroism in a time of poverty and abysmal lack of faith,” she says. “I wanted to deal with the material in a way that was also about the act of separation—separating man from horse and man from myth.”\nMONUMENTS is a major group exhibition running concurrently at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA and The Brick, which pairs decommissioned historical monuments with contemporary artists as a response to the layered and living histories post-Civil War. The show continues in Los Angeles through May 3.\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo C. Stanley Photography)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe mission of the Roman J. Witt Residency Program is to support the production of new work at the University of Michigan. Open to both established and emerging artists and designers, the program awards one residency each academic year. Witt Residents receive an honorarium of $20,000 for up to 12 weeks in residence, plus housing, studio space, and up to $10,000 in materials, research, and development funding.\nThe 2026–27 Witt Residency is organized in partnership with the University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities (IH). During the Witt Residency, it is expected that the resident actively engages with the Stamps School of Art & Design and the IH communities. To this end, a portion of the resident’s time at the university will be spent in direct interaction with students and faculty. \nThe Institute for the Humanities will provide their renowned contemporary gallery as an installation and project space. The gallery has long been a nimble and progressive place for critical inquiry, with the ability to respond to complex and timely issues. Each exhibition offers a point of accessibility for public engagement, making more visible the connection between humanities research and real-world problems, with a deliberate commitment to social practice.\nThe 2026–2027 resident will conduct planning sessions remotely during the Fall 2026 academic semester. They will be on-site in Ann Arbor during the Winter 2027 academic semester, with their exhibition opening in Fall 2027. The artist will also give a lecture/presentation in the Penny Stamps Speaker Series.\nPerformance artist Stacey Kirby was the 2025 artist-in-residence, and interdisciplinary artist Holly Bass is the artist-in-residence for 2026. \nProposals for the 2026–27 Witt Residency Program can be submitted through January 15, 2026. The Witt Residency program’s application process is conducted using the online review system SlideRoom. A nominal $15 submission fee applies, which goes directly to SlideRoom for providing hosting services.\nFor more information, visit stamps.umich.edu.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

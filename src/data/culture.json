    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt felt, for quite some time there, like the age of Frank Gehry would nev­er end. But now that the lat­est defin­ing fig­ure of Amer­i­can archi­tec­ture — or tech­ni­cal­ly, Cana­di­an-Amer­i­can archi­tec­ture — has died at the age of 96, the time has come to ask when, exact­ly, his age began. Or rather, with which build­ing: Walt Dis­ney Con­cert Hall in Los Ange­les? The Louis Vuit­ton Foun­da­tion in Paris? The rad­i­cal ren­o­va­tion of his own hum­ble San­ta Mon­i­ca home often cit­ed at the ori­gin point of the metal­lic, delib­er­ate­ly incon­gru­ous, often near­ly alien aes­thet­ic now rec­og­nized around the world? Accord­ing to the B1M video above, it is to the Guggen­heim Muse­um Bil­bao we must look to if we wish to under­stand the archi­tec­ture of Frank Gehry — and much else besides.\nThe Guggen­heim Bil­bao was a chal­leng­ing project when it was first con­ceived in the ear­ly nine­teen-nineties, but then, Bil­bao was a chal­lenged set­ting. Once a pros­per­ous port city, the Basque metrop­o­lis had fall­en on hard times indeed, rapid­ly dein­dus­tri­al­iz­ing with­out much in the way of alter­na­tive appeal. Bil­bao’s slight his­to­ry with tourism went back to the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry, but for many Spaniards, the prospect of turn­ing the place into an inter­na­tion­al des­ti­na­tion seemed remote at best. Still, an ambi­tious devel­op­ment plan was devised involv­ing new infra­struc­ture, includ­ing the city’s first metro sys­tem, cen­tered around a branch of New York’s Solomon R. Guggen­heim Muse­um.\nWith its orig­i­nal Fifth Avenue loca­tion designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (Gehry’s pre­de­ces­sor in the cul­tur­al role of the one archi­tect, or “star­chi­tect,” of whom every­one has heard), that insti­tu­tion had a cer­tain degree of expe­ri­ence with dar­ing build­ing designs. Famil­iar though the look of its gleam­ing sculp­tur­al curves may be today, actu­al­ly con­struct­ing their non-Euclid­ean geo­met­ric forms in real­i­ty required tech­nolo­gies nev­er before wide­ly employed in archi­tec­ture, includ­ing the ear­ly 3D-mod­el­ing sys­tem CATIA (this video’s spon­sor, inci­den­tal­ly). Nor was the search for the right exte­ri­or tex­ture to reflect Bil­bao’s dis­tinc­tive­ly cloudy skies espe­cial­ly straight­for­ward, but it did ben­e­fit from good tim­ing: Gehry deter­mined that tita­ni­um could do the job, where­upon the mass decom­mis­sion­ing of Sovi­et sub­marines hap­pened to dump a great deal of that mate­r­i­al on the mar­ket.\nIn these tech­no­log­i­cal, polit­i­cal, and eco­nom­ic ways, the Guggen­heim Bil­bao was a prod­uct of its time. As it hap­pened, it and the asso­ci­at­ed rede­vel­op­ments did, in fact, breathe new life into the city, which has inspired a decades-long “Bil­bao effect” on projects around the world with sim­i­lar goals, some of them also fea­tur­ing Gehry-designed cul­tur­al insti­tu­tions. As the B1M host Fred Mills puts it, “Telling a sto­ry like this real­ly is like read­ing out a list of things that we, today, take for grant­ed: the idea that a muse­um could be an inter­na­tion­al tourist attrac­tion, the tech­nol­o­gy, the 3D design.” And, like most archi­tects, Gehry is sur­vived by not just his built lega­cy, but also a series of projects not yet com­plete — includ­ing the Guggen­heim Abu Dhabi, sched­uled to open its doors next year.\nYou can see a pho­to gallery of Gehry’s oth­er ground­break­ing archi­tec­tur­al projects at The Guardian.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nGehry’s Vision for Archi­tec­ture\nAn Archi­tec­tur­al Tour of Sagra­da Família, Antoni Gaudí’s Auda­cious Church That’s Been Under Con­struc­tion for 142 Years\nOn the Impor­tance of the Cre­ative Brief: Frank Gehry, Maira Kalman & Oth­ers Explain its Essen­tial Role\nHow Zaha Hadid Rev­o­lu­tion­ized Archi­tec­ture & Drew Inspi­ra­tion from Russ­ian Avant-Garde Art\nTake an Online Course on Design & Archi­tec­ture with Frank Gehry\nFrank Lloyd Wright Thought About Mak­ing the Guggen­heim Muse­um Pink\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nPho­to via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nThe his­to­ry of sci­ence, like most every his­to­ry we learn, comes to us as a pro­ces­sion of great, almost exclu­sive­ly white, men, unbro­ken but for the occa­sion­al token woman—well-deserving of her hon­ors but seem­ing­ly anom­alous nonethe­less. “If you believe the his­to­ry books,” notes the Time­line series The Matil­da Effect, “sci­ence is a guy thing. Dis­cov­er­ies are made by men, which spur fur­ther inno­va­tion by men, fol­lowed by acclaim and prizes for men. But too often, there is an unsung woman genius who deserves just as much cred­it” and who has been over­shad­owed by male col­leagues who grabbed the glo­ry.\nIn 1993, Cor­nell Uni­ver­si­ty his­to­ri­an of sci­ence Mar­garet Rossiter dubbed the denial of recog­ni­tion to women sci­en­tists “the Matil­da effect,” for suf­frag­ist and abo­li­tion­ist Matil­da Joslyn Gage, whose 1893 essay “Woman as an Inven­tor” protest­ed the com­mon asser­tion that “woman… pos­sess­es no inven­tive or mechan­i­cal genius.” Such asser­tions, Gage pro­ceed­ed to demon­strate, “are care­less­ly or igno­rant­ly made… although woman’s sci­en­tif­ic edu­ca­tion has been gross­ly neglect­ed, yet some of the most impor­tant inven­tions of the world are due to her.”\nOver 100 years lat­er, Rossiter’s tena­cious work in unearthing the con­tri­bu­tions of U.S. women sci­en­tists inspired the His­to­ry of Sci­ence Soci­ety to name a pres­ti­gious prize after her. The Time­line series pro­files a few of the women whom it describes as prime exam­ples of the Matil­da effect, includ­ing Dr. Lise Meit­ner, the Aus­tri­an-born physi­cist and pio­neer of nuclear tech­nol­o­gy who escaped the Nazis and became known in her time as “the Jew­ish Moth­er of the Bomb,” though she had noth­ing to do with the atom­ic bomb. Instead, “Meit­ner led the research that ulti­mate­ly dis­cov­ered nuclear fis­sion.” But Meit­ner would become “lit­tle more than a foot­note in the his­to­ry of Nazi sci­en­tists and the birth of the Atom­ic age.”\nInstead, Meitner’s col­league Otto Hahn received the acco­lades, a Nobel Prize in Chem­istry and “renown as the dis­cov­er­er of nuclear fis­sion. Meit­ner, who direct­ed Hahn’s most sig­nif­i­cant exper­i­ments and cal­cu­lat­ed the ener­gy release result­ing from fis­sion, received a few essen­tial­ist head­lines fol­lowed by decades of obscu­ri­ty.” (See Meit­ner and Hahn in the pho­to above.) Like­wise, the name of Alice Augus­ta Ball has been “all but scrubbed from the his­to­ry of med­i­cine,” though it was Ball, an African Amer­i­can chemist from Seat­tle, Wash­ing­ton, who pio­neered what became known as the Dean Method, a rev­o­lu­tion­ary treat­ment for lep­rosy.\nBall con­duct­ed her research at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Hawaii, but she trag­i­cal­ly died at the age of 24, in what was like­ly a lab acci­dent, before the results could be pub­lished. Instead, Uni­ver­si­ty Pres­i­dent Dr. Arthur Dean, who had co-taught chem­istry class­es with Ball, con­tin­ued her work. But he failed “to men­tion Ball’s key con­tri­bu­tion” despite protes­ta­tions from Dr. Har­ry Holl­mann, a sur­geon who worked with Ball on treat­ing lep­rosy patients. Dean claimed cred­it and pub­lished their work under his name. Decades lat­er, “the scant archival trail of Alice Ball was redis­cov­ered…. In 2000, a plaque was installed at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Hawaii com­mem­o­rat­ing Ball’s accom­plish­ments.”\nOth­er women in the Matil­da effect series include bac­te­r­i­al geneti­cist Esther Leder­berg, who made amaz­ing dis­cov­er­ies in genet­ics that won her hus­band a Nobel Prize; Irish astro­physi­cist Joce­lyn Bell Bur­nell, who dis­cov­ered the first radio pul­sars in 1967, but was exclud­ed from the Nobel award­ed to her the­sis super­vi­sor Antony Hewish and astronomer Mar­tin Ryle. A sim­i­lar fate befell Dr. Ros­alind Franklin, the chemist exclud­ed from the Nobel award­ed to her col­leagues James Wat­son, Fran­cis Crick, and Mau­rice Wilkins for the dis­cov­ery of DNA.\nThese promi­nent exam­ples are but the tip of the ice­berg when it comes to women who made sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tions to sci­en­tif­ic his­to­ry and were reward­ed by being writ­ten out of it and denied awards and recog­ni­tion in their life­time. For more on the his­to­ry of U.S. women in sci­ence and the social forces that worked to exclude them, see Mar­garet Rossiter’s three-vol­ume Women Sci­en­tists in Amer­i­ca series: Strug­gles and Strate­gies to 1940, Before Affir­ma­tive Action, 1940–1972, and Forg­ing a New World since 1972.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nPastoral scenes and still lifes from the 18th and 19th centuries often brim with visual metaphors of prestige and masculinity, from men on horseback to game birds or other spoils of the hunt strung up and ready to be cooked. Dogs, symbols of fidelity and obedience, are often accomplices in these scenes, serving as both companions and workers.\nFor Scott Csoke, the canines portrayed in these historical genre paintings provide the basis for a series of acrylic works in which they and other animals interact “as expressive avatars of queer experience,” says a statement from Sargent’s Daughters, which recently exhibited the artist’s work.\n“Puppies Fighting Over Homosexuality” (2025), acrylic on panel, 12 x 12 inches\nCsoke’s brushstrokes are looser and airier than the refined, smooth texture academic oil painters would strive for. And his addition of slender rainbows—a symbol of the LGBTQ+ unity and pride—infuses an element that seems playfully at odds with the paintings’ original intent to show the owner’s status or virility. Instead, the scenes’ secondary characters take the main stage, emotionally dealing with what it means to not only come to terms with one’s own sexuality but the nature of queer community.\nFor example, in “Puppies Fighting Over Homosexuality,” a diverse group of dogs, ostensibly showing strength and loyalty, gnash at one another. A diminutive rainbow hovers between them, the tiny emblem embodying joy and pride while also being a source of division and misunderstanding—just like the way sexual orientation and gender continue to be important yet schismatic issues in society today.\nCsoke explores a wide range of queer emotional and social experiences, summoning emotions and narratives that range from grief to glee. “A Concert of Gay Birds,” for one, celebrates the avians’ togetherness, despite their differences, beneath a slender rainbow. In “Dead Gay Crane” or “Dead Gay Bird (Hanging),” he strikes a more somber note, nodding to violence perpetrated against LGBTQ+ people with rainbows that take on a halo-like quality.\n“Dead Gay Crane” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 60 x 48 inches\nWhile the original purpose of the historical paintings were meant as decoration, Csoke leans into this as a positive attribute rather than something to be dismissed. “Csoke’s work reveals that decoration carries profound meaning, as it has often been the area in which queer people are able to present themselves most authentically,” the gallery says.\nFind more on the artist’s website and Instagram.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom Iceland’s Arctic Henge to snowy forests, the vistas represented in the 2025 Northern Lights Photographer of the Year contest highlight the visual symphony of geomagnetic light phenomena. Paired with distinctive landscapes, the images illuminate our planet’s unique relationship with the sun.\nWhile photographers captured some scenes in subarctic regions where the northern lights are vivid and common, others created images farther south or in the opposite hemisphere, where the phenomenon is known as aurora australis. For example, Jeff Cullen’s portrait of two sea stacks on the coast of Victoria, Australia, is veiled by a bright pink display.\nRoi Levi, “Corona Blast Aurora Geomagnetic Storm”\n2025 was a great year for spotting the auroras, marked by high levels of geomagnetic activity as the sun reached what’s known as solar maximum. Lasting approximately 12 months, the phase was part of a regular 11-year cycle in which the magnetic poles flip on our Solar System’s star. During this period, the orb transitions from a state of relative calm to stormy turbulence, and the latter is when the auroras become particularly intense, frequent, and visible in more parts of the world.\nOn Earth, the auroras are created when charged solar particles interact with the planet’s atmosphere, assuming myriad illuminated shapes and motion patterns in magenta, green, purple, red, and blue. Curtain-like stretches may swoop across the sky twist into spiraling forms, while others may appear more like rays or starbursts.\nThe Northern Lights Photographer of the Year competition aims to showcase both established and emerging photographers, along with highlighting locations where the auroras are less common. Organized by Capture the Atlas, the contest shares the top 25 images of the year on its website.\nYou might also enjoy perusing the winners of the 2025 Milky Way Photographer of the Year.\nMarc Rassel, “Auroral Cinnamon Roll”\nJeff Cullen, “Gibson Steps Aurora”\nMari Jääskeläinen, “The Northern Crown”\nSadeq Hayati, “Nightscape”\nNikki Born, “Frozen Silence Beneath the Lights”\nVirgil Reglioni, “Twisting Turn”\nVictor Lima, “A Cathedral of Green Light Rising Over Skógafoss”\nVincent Beudez, “Arctic Rain”\nPablo Ruiz Garcia, “Sueños en Eystrahorn”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo by Nelson Almeida/AFP via Getty Images)\n    \n        \n            Thieves in Brazil snatched 13 artworks from a municipal library in São Paulo on Sunday, December 7, including eight engravings by French painter Henri Matisse and five works by Brazilian artist Candido Portinari, as initially reported by local outlet Globo.A spokesperson for the São Paulo state government told Hyperallergic that civil police had identified one suspect in the robbery of the Mário de Andrade Library, but did not confirm that works by Matisse or Portinari were among the stolen items. Investigators located the vehicle the thieves used to escape, the spokesperson said, and a second suspect has not yet been identified.\"Investigations continue to identify the second suspect and locate the stolen works of art,\" the spokesperson told Hyperallergic. Brazilian authorities said the suspects held up a security guard and an elderly couple visiting the museum during the heist. Video released by Globo reportedly shows a suspect carrying several works in public in broad daylight. The suspect appears to place the works next to a pile of trash and walk away.According to ABC News, the stolen artworks were part of the exhibition Do Livro ao Museu (From the Book to the Museum), held in partnership with the Museum of Modern Art of São Paulo. The exhibition, which explored the production of art books and tensions over abstraction in modern art in Brazil, closed on Sunday. An exhibition checklist suggests that the stolen works came from a limited-edition copy of Matisse's book Jazz, published by the Parisian Tériade Editions in 1947, held in the library's collection.The book contains 20 plates with 16 3/4-by-25 3/5-inch (42.5-by-65 cm) stencil on paper artworks Matisse created during a time of medical immobility, leading the artist to \"draw with scissors,\" according to the exhibition's catalogue. An edition of the art book sold for $774,000 at Christie's in 2022, and a copy is on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Several etchings by Portinari, considered a pivotal figure of Latin American modernism, are also listed in the Do Livro ao Museu catalogue. The works come from the artist's 1943 book titled after the 1881 novel Memorias Postumas De Bras Cubas (The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas) by Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. The Museum of Modern Art of São Paulo has not yet responded to Hyperallergic's inquiry regarding the stolen items. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        São Paulo\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Tompkins Rivas declined to comment.The news comes just weeks after the institution announced September 22, 2026, as its official opening date, which the museum had pushed back several times, citing pandemic- and supply chain-related delays. It also comes amid a series of staff departures that have raised questions about the museum’s leadership and mission.A crane outside the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, set to open September 2026 (photo Eric Thayer/LA Times via Getty Images)In February, the museum announced that its inaugural Director and CEO Sandra Jackson-Dumont would be stepping down, and in May, the institution laid off 15 full-time and seven part-time employees, mostly from the Learning and Engagement and Museum Services teams. Among them was Bernardo Rondeau, the museum’s curator of film programs, who learned of the layoffs while attending the Cannes Film Festival.Before joining the Lucas in 2020, Tompkins Rivas was the director and chief curator of the Vincent Price Art Museum (VPAM) at East Los Angeles College, where she organized several notable exhibitions, including Tastemakers & Earthshakers: Notes From Los Angeles Youth Culture, 1943-2016 in 2016 and Regeneración: Three Generations of Revolutionary Ideology in 2018. Under her leadership, the modest regional museum became widely recognized as a vibrant hub for contemporary art.“Pilar is a visionary curator and a luminary in our city. Throughout her career, she has opened real pathways for artists, colleagues, and community members to have a seat at the table,” Joseph Daniel Valencia, VPAM’s curator of exhibitions, told Hyperallergic.On Instagram, artist Beatriz Cortez cited the enduring impact of the 2015 Getty symposium “Place and Practice,” which was co-organized by Tompkins Rivas. “She helped bring so many Latinx artists together, which unfolded into collaborations and community,” she wrote, adding that Tompkins Rivas organized the first museum shows of several artists, including herself.In addition to recounting her accolades, colleagues expressed dismay and concern about her sudden and unexplained exit from the museum. “I’ve known Pilar for ten years,” Valencia said. “She’s never been one to throw in the towel. Her departure is truly alarming.” Artist Mario Ybarra flagged that the exit of Tompkins Rivas, who is Mexican American, is particularly distressing against the backdrop of the US government’s increasingly xenophobic and anti-immigrant policies.“As one of a handful of Latinx women in the USA to be leading museums at this critical moment of racist discrimination against brown people, her removal from her post is an insult,” Ybarra told Hyperallergic. (The Lucas Museum did not confirm to Hyperallergic whether Tompkins Rivas was laid off or stepped down.)As the LA Times noted, when Tompkins Rivas was hired in 2020, she was one of six women hired to fill leadership roles, five of whom were women of color. With her departure, only two of them remain.For many, Tompkins Rivas’s exit is just the latest upheaval pointing to more serious issues behind the scenes at the $1 billion museum. In 2017, when the LA City Council approved a site for the Lucas in Exposition Park, a key selling point was the museum’s purported commitment to educational programming, which would serve some 100 schools in the surrounding South LA area. With the dismantling of virtually the whole educational department, it is unclear how that mission will be fulfilled. \"This absolutely raises questions about how exactly this private museum on public land is supposed to be serving the community,” culture writer Carolina Miranda told Hyperallergic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLos Angeles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalifornia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLucas Museum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n",

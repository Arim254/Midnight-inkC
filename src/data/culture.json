Studio Ghibli’s PONYO debuts February 14 at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, which opened in 2021 with a Miyazaki retrospective. This show aims to convey the film’s whimsy and wonder while examining its profound significance through Miyazaki’s drawings and other elements behind its production.“He set out to do a simple film with a simple storyline for young children,” exhibition curator Jessica Niebel told Hyperallergic. “He achieved that, but Ponyo is also very multi-layered and complex.”Art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida are on view in the exhibition. (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)After creating films for a slightly older audience, such as Princess Mononoke (1997) and Spirited Away (2001), Miyazaki had younger children in mind with Ponyo, which was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Little Mermaid. In keeping with this, the sight lines of much of the exhibition are intentionally lowered, said Shraddha Aryal, executive VP of exhibitions at the Academy Museum. She and her team also designed interactive elements, such as a movable figure of Ponyo running across the waves and a large-scale green bucket based on the one that Sosuke keeps Ponyo in, which smaller visitors can crawl into.There is also an interactive animation table, featuring colorful sea-creature cut-outs designed by Studio Ghibli. Using their phone and an app, guests can rearrange squid, crabs, sharks, and a pufferfish to create their own stop-motion film.The show includes a large-scale green bucket, a reference from the film, which smaller visitors can crawl into. (© Academy Museum Foundation, photo by Emily Shur)To reference the organic forms of Ponyo’s nautical world, Miyazaki was adamant that only curved lines be used in the film’s animation. “Get rid of straight lines. Use gently warped lines that allow the possibility of magic to exist, liberating us from the curse of perspective drawing. A world where even the horizon swells, dips, and sways,” he intones from a wall panel in the exhibition. Aryal echoed this sentiment in the exhibition design, even fabricating circular frames for the watercolor and pastel art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida.Ponyo is significant in part because it was completely hand-drawn, a return to form after some computer animation was used in previous Ghibli films. The exhibition features over 100 objects donated by Studio Ghibli, including several drawings by Miyazaki, highlighting the analog aspect of the film’s creation. The works are staged around a modest wooden desk used by Ghibli animators.A wooden desk used by Ghibli animators (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)These objects, with their distinctly human traces, will perhaps be even more deeply appreciated by audiences today, amid an onslaught of digitally generated images often indistinguishable from reality. Studio Ghibli’s Ponyo is not an exhaustive cinematic overview of the film, but rather an evocative experience that channels some of its captivating enchantment. “The film has these moments of slowing down, contemplative, mesmerizing moments,” Niebel said, adding that the oversized bucket offers an entry point into this calm, cool world. “Originally, we wanted to make it a little smaller, and then our director Amy Homma asked, ‘What if adults want to crawl in, too?’”Installation view of Studio Ghibli’s PONYO at the Academy Museum (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Los Angeles\n                      \n                      \n                        Studio Ghibli\n                      \n                      \n                        Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

(all photos by Studio Kukla, courtesy Participant Inc., unless otherwise noted)\n    \n        \n            Upon entering Participant Inc. gallery in Manhattan's Chinatown, a pitch-black embrace invites us find one another in the dark. As our eyesight adjusts, a constellation of works illuminates [minna|منا]of us, a group exhibition open through March 15 featuring queer artists of the Palestinian, Jordanian, Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian diasporas. Wafts of burning incense mingle with the instrumentals of a commissioned sound mix by Palestinian musician Falyakon to direct visitors through the show, which Palestinian-Jordanian-Egyptian artist Ridikkuluz curated as a space for anti-colonial futurism across tradition and geography.“The show is about giving the pen back to the writer, giving the paintbrush back to the artist, during this time of genocide,” Ridikkuluz told Hyperallergic in an interview at the gallery. “And when there's been so much censorship, these are artists that might not have been able to do this anywhere else.”Across from “Triumvirate” (2023) are three photos by Elias Rischmawi and their family members. (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)While [minna|منا]of us centers the narratives of queer artists with roots in the region, Ridikkuluz emphasized that those identity markers are not the exhibition's sole focus. The show comes at a time when the oppression of LGBTQ+ Arabs has been weaponized in support of Israel's genocide in Gaza, but it intentionally avoids dwelling on collective trauma. “Regarding the work that I'm showing, people are always asking me, 'Is your family okay with you being trans?' And I really hate that question in a way,” said Elias Rischmawi, a multimedia artist of Palestinian descent. “I show that I'm so connected with my family through my work. Even if we might be distant, or if we have our differences, I'm still celebrated in my community. And it's like a 'fuck you' to that.”Elias Jesús Rischmawi, “Triumvirate” (2023)In the exhibition, Rischmawi presents five archival and contemporary photographs depicting family members in Florida, Beit Sahour in the Occupied West Bank, and San Fernando in Chile. In one diptych, a black-and-white photo shows Rischmawi laying their head on their mother's knee, mirroring the adjacent print of a now-lost painting of the artist's mother and great-grandmother in a similar pose.Similarly reaching into tradition and lineage, queer identical twins André and Evan Lenox-Samour work collaboratively and meticulously with mother of pearl — a reference to intricate family heirlooms that were safeguarded during the Nakba in Palestine. Their shimmering sculptures pay homage to these precious objects and to the storied mother-of-pearl artisans of the Hazboun family in Bethlehem through motifs like arrows and eight-pointed stars, evoking themes of direction, migration, and placelessness.André and Evan Lenox-Samour, “The Sky's Assault on the Reality of Men” (2026) (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)André and Evan Lenox-Samour, “The Salmon’s Return (Awdat Al-Samak)” (2019–2024)The exhibition also includes a mixed-media installation by trans Palestinian artist Xaytun Ennasr, a stone bust referencing Egyptian funerary sculptures by Alex Khalifa, and a contemplative film, “Congress of Idoling Persons” (2021), by Beirut-born artist Basyma Saad. On the next floor, home to exhibition co-organizer SALMA gallery, hangs Syrian-Canadian artist Anka Kassabji's poised self-portrait. Relaxing in an icy bath, she gazes over her shoulder with authority while her legs, crossed at the ankle, jut out from the water — resembling the neck of a chilled champagne bottle.Anka Kassabji, “Syrienne Delamer” (2026)“I may be not as confident as my paintings are, but I always want to represent extremely fierce feminine energy in my work,” she told Hyperallergic. “The work has this effect of really icy weather that can be uncomfortable, but I'm still very much in control, and I wanted to celebrate what I've achieved throughout those hard times.”Across the gallery hang three vibrant paintings by Palestinian-Jordanian artist Fares Rizk that portray his better-known alter ego: Sultana, New York's first Palestinian drag queen. Blonde and buxom, Sultana day-dreams, eats knafeh, and snaps a selfie before date night with her devoted boyfriend — channeling her vivacity from the stage to the canvas.Fares Rizk (Sultana), “Date Night“ (2018)Rizk, who has lived in New York for 40 years and debuted Sultana in 1996, told Hyperallergic that his mother heavily encouraged his interests in dance, art, and makeup. Though his siblings have been less supportive, Rizk says that nothing can get between Sultana and her place under the spotlight. “When I belly-dance on stage and the people clap and the light is on me, it's healing all the anxiety,” Rizk said.Exhibition view of Xaytoun Ennasr's “I Want the Land, Not the Sky” (2026)Alex Khalifa, “Bust“ (2026)\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            New York politicians and activists hoisted a large Pride flag to the Stonewall National Monument’s flagpole on Thursday afternoon, February 12, in defiance of a federal directive to take down any flags or pennants that aren’t the United States flag or from the Department of the Interior.It takes a lot to get New Yorkers to stand outdoors in subfreezing temperatures for more than an hour, but the Trump administration’s onslaught on an iconic gay rights symbol in the West Village mobilized a crowd to Christopher Park.“Whose streets? Our streets! Whose park? Our park! Whose neighborhood? Our neighborhood!” chanted several hundred people, who spilled into Christopher and Grove streets.National Park Service (NPS) employees had quietly removed the rainbow Pride flag on Monday, almost exactly a year after scrubbing multiple references to transgender and queer people from descriptions on its website of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising and the birth of the modern LGBTQ+ movement. On Wednesday, federal employees reportedly installed a US flag on the pole where the Pride flag had flown.Crowds filled the park for the impromptu ceremony. (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)The move was part of the White House’s widespread campaign to whitewash American history in displays at museums and national historic sites, including the Smithsonian Institution and Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia.  But the agency’s decision to pull down the Pride flag prompted a swift backlash from Mayor Zohran Mamdani, Governor Kathy Hochul, and dozens of Democratic leaders across the city, who immediately vowed to return it to its rightful place.“Our city has a duty not just to honor this legacy, but to live up to it,” Mamdani tweeted on Tuesday. “I will always fight for a New York City that invests in our LGBTQ+ community, defends their dignity, and protects every one of our neighbors—without exception.”A Trans Pride flag is seen on the \"Gay Liberation\" sculpture by George Segal. (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)Three days after the flag’s removal, Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal organized an impromptu flag-raising ceremony at the site with nearly every elected official in Lower Manhattan, drawing several hundred activists and onlookers who spilled out onto Christopher, Grove, and West Fourth streets.Their plan was to attach the Pride flag on a smaller aluminum pole, carry it toward the permanent flagpole in the center of Christopher Park, and affix it to the flagpole with several black plastic zip ties.It did not go smoothly. “Why are the politicians up there and the people are back here?” one activist shouted. “History is not a f–ing photo-op!” another said.A temporary flag was raised by local politicians, only to be taken down moments later by activists, who put it on the permanent flagpole with the US flag. (photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A pair of activists approached the crowd of elected officials and had a brief discussion with them while some in the crowd chanted, “Raise the flag!” and “Do it proper!” The officials slowly retreated toward the Christopher Street side of the park while activists took several minutes to cut the zip ties and lower the US flag, before threading the Pride flag through the halyard that attached the American flag and raising them together. “I don’t know what happened,” Manhattan Assemblyman Tony Simone told Hyperallergic. “We didn’t want to take the US flag down. That wasn’t the goal. We wanted both of them side by side.”A half hour later, both flags waved vigorously in the wind, satisfying much of the crowd, which headed across the street to the Stonewall Inn for happy hour.Bronx-based artist and drag queen Timothy French poses at the Stonewall ceremony. (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)Timothy French, a Bronx trans non-binary artist and drag queen, brought their own trans pride flag to the event. They told Hyperallergic that the Trump administration's attack on the gay pride flag was devastating, but nothing new.“Today there's more understanding within the LGBTQIA+ community, but as society, especially in areas throughout Middle America, they don't know trans people,” French said. “We're just 1% of the population, and there's that lack of real-life exposure, so you have conservative media, you have the religious leaders, and so on that are demonizing the trans community when they don't really even know what they're saying.”Before Trump’s second term, visitors to Christopher Park could sometimes find the Trans Pride flag flying alongside the Pride rainbow flag. But last year, caretakers were reportedly told that only the traditional rainbow flag, initially designed in 1978 by Gilbert Baker, was allowed.“It's just another way to erase people in society and their right to exist and live their lives,” French said.Some attendees raised handmade signs and chanted. (photo Aaron Short/Hyperallergic)Newly elected State Senator Erik Bottcher, who represented the West Village and led the City Council’s LGBTQIA+ caucus, said the monument and its history were too important to the community to let the Trump administration attempt to erase their significance.“When I was growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains, I felt so alone, so hopeless, I didn’t want to be alive, but when I learned about Stonewall and its proud history, it gave me hope,” he told Hyperallergic.Hoylman-Sigal said it was important for all New Yorkers to celebrate the site of the birthplace of the LGBTQ+ rights movement.“I predict if [NPS] tries to take it down, we will return, but they may want to keep it up,” Hoylman-Sigal said.Hyperallergic has contacted the National Park Service for comment.Rhea Nayyar contributed reporting.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Stonewall\n                      \n                  \n        ",

It is an enduring question — and one I rarely hear asked of the medieval world. Looking to the Middle Ages for answers to the perennial puzzles of life can seem quaint, even artificial, a long reach across centuries marked by violence, hierarchy, and exclusion. And yet medieval culture offers a way of thinking about love that still speaks to the present. If love is most urgently tested in moments of strain and upheaval, then it is in those moments — where care is stressed or obscured — that its meaning comes most clearly into view.In our own moment, we are living amid forms of exhaustion that make sustained attention difficult: humanitarian emergencies reduced to statistics, social care systems hollowed out by austerity, and digital economies that reward speed over responsibility. Care is not absent so much as continually deferred, obscured by scale, distance, and a growing insistence that vulnerability should be managed rather than answered.Medieval European visual culture returns to moments of strain and trial again and again, often figuring them through blackness: through bodies marked by humility, penitence, and spiritual testing. Images of Black figures in the Western tradition are not rare, but love — in its fullest, most generous sense — is rarely what they seem to offer at first glance. In depictions of figures such as Saint Maurice, blackness often functions as a site of moral recognition, inviting viewers to identify with sanctity by confronting their own sin and insufficiency. Other familiar figures, such as Balthazar, likewise position blackness as meaningful primarily for what it signifies to the viewer — distance, universality, or the far reaches of Christendom — rather than as an interior condition. These images open space for identification and self-scrutiny, but they stop short of imagining blackness as generative: not merely a mirror of sin, but the ground from which love itself might take shape.Gerard David, \"The Adoration of the Magi\" (c. 1520), oil on wood (image public domain CC0 via the Metropolitan Museum of Art)One image, in the 15th-century alchemical manuscript Aurora consurgens (Rising Dawn), complicates this way of seeing: a late medieval angel with black skin, green wings, and a body cut open to reveal a glowing red interior. In medieval theological and devotional writing, moral goodness was conventionally imagined through the language of light and whiteness. As the 6th-century theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite writes in The Celestial Hierarchy, divine goodness overflows with light, illuminating all things according to their capacity to receive it — a formulation that shaped centuries of Christian thought about purity, hierarchy, and visibility. White garments, lightly colored hair, and white luminous flesh became visual shorthand for innocence, obedience, and sanctity.As an angel, she is meant to embody these virtues. And yet her skin is black. Set against the warmth of the light that radiates from within, her blackness unsettles how goodness is meant to appear. What kind of love could take shape here?The Aurora consurgens is a late medieval alchemical manuscript that combines dense, allegorical prose with striking images meant to guide the reader through a process of inner transformation. Attributed to a pseudo-Aquinas, the text reimagines alchemy not as the pursuit of material gold, but as a spiritual discipline concerned with humility, self-knowledge, and the gradual reformation of the soul. In the Aurora consurgens, nigredo, rubedo, and albedo are described as distinct stages within the alchemical process of spiritual transformation — but not as a simple ascent from darkness to light. Nigredo names a condition of contrition and unmaking; rubedo intensifies and exposes this state through heat, incision, and inner transformation; and albedo appears as a fragile, receptive condition rather than a final resolution.Crucially, the text repeatedly warns that whiteness can be false or destructive if severed from what precedes it. Transformation here does not proceed by erasing blackness, but by carrying it forward, integrating it into a changed interior life capable of receiving love.Angels, planets, and bodies recur throughout the manuscript as allegories for interior conditions, making this black angel not an isolated curiosity, but part of a larger visual system devoted to becoming, rather than achieving perfection.To envision nigredo — the first stage of the transformation of the soul — as the skin and hair of the angel is to translate a spiritual condition of contrition, brokenness, and humility into the most material and inescapably human surface of the body. In the late Middle Ages, skin was understood as revelatory: it registered character, disclosed interior disposition, and marked one’s place in the world. Though affected by climate, labor, or emotion, it could not simply be shed. By locating nigredo on the skin rather than in atmosphere, shadow, or dress, the illuminator signals that this stage of the soul’s conversion is constitutive rather than peripheral, enduring rather than temporary — not a stain to be erased, but a condition one inhabits. Blackness here becomes visible on the body’s most exposed surface, rendering nigredo not as abstraction but as something shared, embodied, and recognizably human. It was this move — blackness understood as an enduring, human condition rather than a symbolic overlay — that first unsettled me and drew me to the image.In the Middle Ages, blackness did not function primarily as a marker of identity. As scholars of the Middle Ages have shown, it operated on more than one register: both as a symbolic language rich with meanings tied to repentance and salvation, and as a framework through which racial thinking gradually emerged. As Geraldine Heng has shown in her study of Black holy figures, medieval imagery often used black skin as a surface of moral recognition: a visible sign through which viewers were invited to confront sin and spiritual vulnerability. Yet even within this hermeneutical tradition, blackness is often treated as static — the mark of sin awaiting purification, the darkness meant to be washed into white.What distinguishes the Aurora consurgens is that blackness is not erased in the process of transformation. It is inscribed on the body itself, redefining transformation not as the removal of blackness but as the condition that makes the soul capable of receiving love. In the Aurora, love is not imagined as purity already achieved, nor as transcendence beyond the human condition. It appears instead as a capacity, one that becomes possible only after the self has been unmade. The black angel embodies this logic. Her black skin does not signal a condition to be overcome, but the necessary ground through which love takes shape. Stripped of mastery and self-sufficiency, the soul becomes capable of receiving rather than possessing, of recognizing rather than judging. The image does not imagine love as reward or resolution, but as a capacity that follows unmaking — one that becomes possible only once the self has been broken open. The angel does not love despite blackness, but through it.Taken seriously, this medieval image shows that the soul’s supposed “darkness” — its faltering, its confrontation with its own fragility — is not an obstacle to change but the condition that makes transformation possible. To say that we are all, in this sense, marked by blackness is not to erase racial specificity or historical difference. It is to name a shared movement through unmaking, the breakdown that precedes any genuine capacity for love. In a moment defined by turmoil and a staggering failure of empathy, the image invites us to understand love not as something reserved for the pure or the obedient, but as something that takes root precisely in vulnerability. Blackness here is not an ending, nor a condemnation. It is the space where love becomes possible in the first place.Editor's Note: This essay was based in part on a lecture delivered at the Love: A RaceB4Race Symposium organized by Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, on January 24.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

My partner and I are both passionate, hard-headed people (I'm an Aries, he's a Taurus, pray for us), and when we're at odds, neither of us is good at surrendering. But in our shared experiences of art — in conversation and in quiet reflection — we bare the soulful sensitivity that is the fertile soil of empathy. Our edges soften; our breath deepens. We make room for nuance. Art, as Agnes Martin so precisely said, “is the concrete representation of our most subtle feelings.”In this week's edition, artist and educator Mónica Palma shares her own discoveries in art and making through her work with children, finding inspiring expressions in their intimate, often physical engagements with the world.

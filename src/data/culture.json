    "body": "\n\tin Business, Design |   \tNovember 21st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe humorist San­dra Tsing Loh once described her gen­er­a­tional cohort as “today’s young, high­ly trained, down­ward­ly mobile pro­fes­sion­als: ‘dump­ies.’ We’re just emerg­ing from years of col­lege only to learn that there are no jobs avail­able for peo­ple with our advanced qual­i­fi­ca­tions,” and thus no route to own­er­ship of all their hoped-for lifestyle accou­trements. No, she’s not a mil­len­ni­al, but rather what she calls a “late boomer” in an essay that dates from the mid-nineties — a few years after IKEA founder Ing­var Kam­prad “came into South­ern Cal­i­for­nia, utter­ing those five immor­tal words: ‘Halo­gen! Impos­si­ble Price: $29!’ The rest was his­to­ry. In that instant, we dump­ies found our niche. We rose up and became the IKEA Gen­er­a­tion!”\nIKEA could expand so far out of its native Swe­den thanks to the suc­cess of prod­ucts like the LACK cof­fee table, the sub­ject of the new Pri­mal Space video above. Though small in scale and high­ly unpre­pos­sess­ing in appear­ance (and, let’s face it, a visu­al byword for cheap fur­nish­ings sec­ond only to the num­ber-one-sell­ing BILLY book­shelf) it’s long been a steady sell­er the world over, not least because its price, just under the equiv­a­lent of ten euros when intro­duced in 1981, has nev­er been raised. To man­age that, IKEA has had to use every trick in its book: not just the do-it-your­self “flat-packed” design it pio­neered, but also non-warp­ing par­ti­cle board, hon­ey­comb paper struc­tures for max­i­mum strength using a min­i­mum of mate­r­i­al, and even new­ly engi­neered leg-fold­ing machines.\nHow­ev­er briskly it sells, this par­tic­u­lar prod­uct may be unfor­tu­nate­ly named in an Eng­lish-speak­ing mar­ket; “What they ‘lack’ is sta­bil­i­ty,” one inter­vie­wee says to Loh. Still, it remains emblem­at­ic enough of the cor­po­rate mis­sion once artic­u­lat­ed by Kam­prad him­self: “To cre­ate a bet­ter every­day life for the major­i­ty of peo­ple.” (“How many Repub­li­can politi­cians can say they’ve done that?” Loh adds. “How many Democ­rats?”) That extends to the design of IKEA’s stores, which offer only one path to fol­low all the way through, like an extra-large fun­house. As not­ed in the video, while this forces cus­tomers to pass every prod­uct — and thus every temp­ta­tion to impulse buy — it also turns a vis­it into an expe­ri­ence unto itself, before the cus­tomer even reach­es the cafe­te­ria. Fun­ny; I could go for a plate of meat­balls right about now.\nIf you want to take a deep dive into the ori­gin and growth of IKEA, lis­ten to this three hour episode from the Acquired pod­cast.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nIKEA Dig­i­tizes & Puts Online 70 Years of Its Cat­a­logs: Explore the Designs of the Swedish Fur­ni­ture Giant\nHans Rosling Uses Ikea Props to Explain World of 7 Bil­lion Peo­ple\nWhat Hap­pens When a Cheap Ikea Print Gets Pre­sent­ed as Fine Art in a Muse­um\nMeet the Mem­phis Group, the Bob Dylan-Inspired Design­ers of David Bowie’s Favorite Fur­ni­ture\nSpike Jonze’s Imag­i­na­tive TV Ads\nCharles & Ray Eames’ Icon­ic Lounge Chair Debuts on Amer­i­can TV (1956)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tNovember 20th, 2025  11 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAny­one who keeps an eye on Hol­ly­wood knows — indeed, has been ever more fre­quent­ly and anx­ious­ly informed — that the the­ater busi­ness is in trou­ble. If few­er of us than ever have been going out to the movies, one rea­son must have to do with the easy avail­abil­i­ty of home stream­ing, to say noth­ing of all the pro­lif­er­at­ing dig­i­tal dis­trac­tions pre­ci­sion-engi­neered to cap­ture our atten­tion. But could it also have to do with a change in the pic­tures them­selves? With more than two mil­lion views racked up in just four days, the new Like Sto­ries of Old video essay above ven­tures an expla­na­tion as to “Why Movies Just Don’t Feel ‘Real’ Any­more.”\nIn recent years, even long, colos­sal­ly bud­get­ed, and cease­less­ly mar­ket­ed spec­ta­cles feel strange­ly insub­stan­tial on any screen, big or small. The video’s cre­ator Tom van der Lin­den points to a vari­ety of fac­tors, begin­ning with a wors­en­ing lack of cor­re­spon­dence between the cin­e­mat­ic image and our per­cep­tion of real­i­ty.\nOne clear­ly — or rather, read­i­ly — notice­able con­tribut­ing trend is the preva­lence of shal­low focus, which keeps the char­ac­ters in the fore­ground sharp but lets all the details of the back­ground go blur­ry: not the way we see the real world, unless we mis­place our glass­es. Because we live in deep focus, deep focus cin­e­matog­ra­phy feels more real to us.\nOf course, not every movie can be Lawrence of Ara­bia. But there was a time when prac­ti­cal­ly all of them did deliv­er what’s called “hap­tic visu­al­i­ty,” the word hap­tic relat­ing to the con­cept of our sense of touch. Old­er films have a tan­gi­bil­i­ty about them in large part because the film­mak­ers had no choice: work­ing only or pri­mar­i­ly with ana­log tools, they could only do so much to detach images from our phys­i­cal expe­ri­ence. Dig­i­tal pho­tog­ra­phy, post-pro­duc­tion CGI, and now the open abyss of AI have made any­thing tech­ni­cal­ly pos­si­ble, though as van der Lin­den under­scores, those tech­nolo­gies by them­selves don’t guar­an­tee that the result­ing movie won’t feel real. Ulti­mate­ly, unre­al­i­ty is a choice, and one we movie­go­ers should hope the indus­try will stop mak­ing — if not for our sat­is­fac­tion, then for its own sur­vival.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Dark Knight: Anato­my of a Flawed Action Scene\nThe Impor­tance of Film Edit­ing Demon­strat­ed by the Bad Edit­ing of Major Films: Bohemi­an Rhap­sody, Sui­cide Squad & More\nWhy Mar­vel and Oth­er Hol­ly­wood Films Have Such Bland Music: Every Frame a Paint­ing Explains the Per­ils of the “Temp Score”\nWhy We All Need Sub­ti­tles Now\nWhy Do Wes Ander­son Movies Look Like That?\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nI’ve just start­ed read­ing J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hob­bit to my daugh­ter. While much of the nuance and the ref­er­ences to Tolkien­ian deep time are lost on her, she eas­i­ly grasps the dis­tinc­tive charms of the char­ac­ters, the nature of their jour­ney, and the per­ils, won­ders, and Elven friends they have met along the way so far. She is famil­iar with fairy tale dwarfs and myth­ic wiz­ards, though not with the typol­o­gy of insu­lar, mid­dle-class, adven­ture-averse coun­try gen­try, thus Hob­bits them­selves took a bit of explain­ing.\nWhile read­ing and dis­cussing the book with her, I’ve won­dered to myself about a pos­si­ble his­tor­i­cal rela­tion­ship between Tolkien’s fairy tale fig­ures and those of the Walt Dis­ney com­pa­ny which appeared around the same time. The troupe of dwarves in The Hob­bit might pos­si­bly share a com­mon ances­tor with Snow White’s dwarfs—in the Ger­man fairy tale the Broth­ers Grimm first pub­lished in 1812. But here is where any sim­i­lar­i­ty between Tolkien and Dis­ney begins and ends.\nIn fact, Tolkien most­ly hat­ed Disney’s cre­ations, and he made these feel­ings very clear. Snow White debuted only months after The Hob­bit’s pub­li­ca­tion in 1937. As it hap­pened, Tolkien went to see the film with lit­er­ary friend and some­time rival C.S. Lewis. Nei­ther liked it very much. In a 1939 let­ter, Lewis grant­ed that “the ter­ri­fy­ing bits were good, and the ani­mals real­ly most mov­ing.” But he also called Dis­ney a “poor boob” and lament­ed “What might not have come of it if this man had been educated—or even brought up in a decent soci­ety?”\nTolkien, notes Atlas Obscu­ra, “found Snow White love­ly, but oth­er­wise wasn’t pleased with the dwarves. To both Tolkien and Lewis, it seemed, Disney’s dwarves were a gross over­sim­pli­fi­ca­tion of a con­cept they held as precious”—the con­cept, that is, of fairy sto­ries. Some might brush away their opin­ions as two Oxford dons gaz­ing down their noses at Amer­i­can mass enter­tain­ment. As Tolkien schol­ar Trish Lam­bert puts it, “I think it grat­ed on them that he [Dis­ney] was com­mer­cial­iz­ing some­thing that they con­sid­ered almost sacro­sanct.”\n“Indeed,” writes Steven D. Grey­danus at the Nation­al Catholic Reg­is­ter, “it would be impos­si­ble to imag­ine” these two authors “being any­thing but appalled by Disney’s sil­ly dwarfs, with their slap­stick humor, nurs­ery-moniker names, and singsong musi­cal num­bers.” One might counter that Tolkien’s dwarves (as he insists on plu­ral­iz­ing the word), also have fun­ny names (derived, how­ev­er, from Old Norse) and also break into song. But he takes pains to sep­a­rate his dwarves from the com­mon run of children’s sto­ry dwarfs.\nTolkien would lat­er express his rev­er­ence for fairy tales in a schol­ar­ly 1947 essay titled “On Fairy Sto­ries,” in which he attempts to define the genre, pars­ing its dif­fer­ences from oth­er types of mar­velous fic­tion, and writ­ing with awe, “the realm of fairy sto­ry is wide and deep and high.” These are sto­ries to be tak­en seri­ous­ly, not dumb­ed-down and infan­tilized as he believed they had been. “The asso­ci­a­tion of chil­dren and fairy-sto­ries,” he writes, “is an acci­dent of our domes­tic his­to­ry.”\nTolkien wrote The Hob­bit for young peo­ple, but he did not write it as a “children’s book.” Noth­ing in the book pan­ders, not the lan­guage, nor the com­plex char­ac­ter­i­za­tion, nor the grown-up themes. Disney’s works, on the oth­er hand, rep­re­sent­ed to Tolkien a cheap­en­ing of ancient cul­tur­al arti­facts, and he seemed to think that Disney’s approach to films for chil­dren was espe­cial­ly con­de­scend­ing and cyn­i­cal.\nHe described Disney’s work on the whole as “vul­gar” and the man him­self, in a 1964 let­ter, as “sim­ply a cheat,” who is “hope­less­ly cor­rupt­ed” by prof­it-seek­ing (though he admits he is “not inno­cent of the prof­it-motive” him­self).\n…I rec­og­nize his tal­ent, but it has always seemed to me hope­less­ly cor­rupt­ed. Though in most of the ‘pic­tures’ pro­ceed­ing from his stu­dios there are admirable or charm­ing pas­sages, the effect of all of them is to me dis­gust­ing. Some have giv­en me nau­sea… \nThis expli­ca­tion of Tolkien’s dis­like for Dis­ney goes beyond mere gos­sip to an impor­tant prac­ti­cal upshot: Tolkien would not allow any of his works to be giv­en the Walt Dis­ney treat­ment. While his pub­lish­er approached the stu­dios about a Lord of the Rings adap­ta­tion (they were turned down at the time), most schol­ars think this hap­pened with­out the author’s knowl­edge, which seems a safe assump­tion to say the least.\nTolkien’s long his­to­ry of express­ing neg­a­tive opin­ions about Dis­ney led to his lat­er for­bid­ding, “as long as it was pos­si­ble,” any of his works to be pro­duced “by the Dis­ney stu­dios (for all whose works I have a heart­felt loathing).” Astute read­ers of Tolkien know his seri­ous intent in even the most com­ic of his char­ac­ters and sit­u­a­tions. Or as Vin­tage News’ Mar­tin Cha­lakos­ki writes, “there is not a speck of Dis­ney in any of those pages.”\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2018.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nJ.R.R.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen Manuela Solano delineates a cheekbone or shapes the chiseled torso of a cowboy standing tall, precisely placed nails, tape, and pipe cleaners offer guidance. The artist, who is blind, works intuitively, feeling out the areas she and her team have marked and trusting that together, the desired imagery will emerge. “I try to force myself to keep [the shapes] faster and looser, which feels great,” she adds. “It makes the process more playful.”\nAt just 26, medical malpractice in her HIV treatments caused Solano to lose her sight. She’s since adapted to new ways of working, as she taps into both her memory and imagination to produce paintings that reflect her concerns and joys. “My work is always, on some level, about myself. I make work about either my taste, my yearnings, or something I see of myself in someone else,” she says.\n\n  \n  \n\nA beautiful film by Barbara Anastacio for T Magazine—which was made in 2018 before the artist’s gender transition—visits Solano’s then-studio in Mexico City and glimpses her process in detail. We see the artist flip through work made before she lost her sight in 2014 as she traces her practice from art school to the present.\nSnowy scenes and portraits appear throughout the sketchbook and offer a visual throughline to her work today. Recent paintings like “Walking on Water” retain the vast landscapes of her earlier pieces as ripples pulse across the sea’s surface. “Me and my team are constantly figuring out the best way to paint textures or effects we haven’t painted before. In that way, we are continually learning,” she adds.\nSimilarly, a collection of self-portraits presented in her solo show Egogénsis, held earlier this year in Madrid, reflects a complex evolution of identity through a variety of tender portraits. Gender is fluid in this body of work, and the connection between humans and nature is intrinsic, as parts of the environment seem to imprint themselves onto her figures. \nWhile Solano does pull from memory, she’s quick to clarify that this process isn’t unique to her practice. “I’ve heard that memories change every time we revisit them,” she says. “This means everybody faces the problem of remembering things a different way than they actually look.”\n“Dinosaurio” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 215 x 215 centimeters\nHaving recently relocated to Berlin, Solano incorporates parts of her daily life into much of her practice, allowing her ongoing experiences and dreams to mix with imagery from the past and produce new compositions. She explains:\n\nNowadays, I am making a lot of work about my current comings and goings, all of it things I obviously have never seen. I think there is a common misinterpretation that my work is perhaps about memory, that I am painting the things I saw. And this often comes with the rather ableist worry that someday I might run out of memories to paint. But this is not the case at all. I am originating new images and putting them in my work all the time.\n\nSolano is also a writer and often pens poems and stories to accompany her paintings. A recent piece, which she refers to as a manifesto, will accompany her new Blind Transgender and Wild series. If you’re in Mexico City, you can see the artist’s pop-culture works through January 4 at Museo Tamayo, before the exhibition travels to CAAC Sevilla in 2026.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nEaster egg-like clouds, glowing sunrise gradients, and myriad vibrant patterns are just a few of the elements comprising David Brian Smith’s otherworldly landscapes.\nSmith grew up in rural Shropshire, England, and his ancestral ties to the region’s agricultural traditions became a major influence on his work after he relocated to London. His works evoke British landscape painting of the likes of the Norwich School of painters, a group of self-taught, working-class artists who self-organized an art society in the early 19th century.\n“All around the Wrekin” (2025), oil on linen, 78 3/4 x 70 7/8 inches\nSmith departs from historically more academic styles of oil painting to create works “re-envisioned through a hallucinatory, technicolor lens,” says Ross + Kramer Gallery, which presents the artist’s solo exhibition, All around the Wrekin. In his starkly contrasted rolling hills, farm buildings, and bulbous trees, Smith also evokes the bucolic yet faintly uncanny paintings of American Regionalist artist Grant Wood (1891-1942).\n“Rooted in the English pastoral tradition yet boldly contemporary in vision, Smith’s paintings explore ideas of place, belonging, and time through radiant color, intricate brushwork, and layered symbolism,” the gallery says. The title of the show references the name of a hill in Shropshire called the Wrekin, distinctive for its conical shape and a popular place to take walks.\nWithin the sky, fields, rivers, and forests, hundreds of little hatch marks, flowers, starbursts, and other thematic motifs dance across the surface. He also often incorporates gold and silver leaf to add an even further ethereality to the large-scale, luminous canvases, tapping into the power of color and light to evoke nostalgia and a kind of psychedelic utopianism.\nAll around the Wrekin continues through November 22 in San Francisco. Smith’s work is also on view as part of Inner and Outer Worlds, an exhibition of international contemporary painting that runs through April 12 at the Ju Ming Museum in Taiwan.

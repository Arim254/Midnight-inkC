    "body": "\n\tin Music, Television |   \tJanuary 16th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nMTV still exists. At least, it still exists in the Unit­ed States, or in cer­tain of that coun­try’s mar­kets, for the time being. A flur­ry of pre­ma­ture obit­u­ar­ies recent­ly blew through the inter­net after the announce­ment that the net­work had shut down in oth­er parts of the world, Europe includ­ed. But even there, some expressed the sen­ti­ment that MTV had already died long before. And indeed, in the U.S., where it orig­i­nal­ly launched, ask­ing who remem­bers when MTV actu­al­ly used to play music videos has been a com­mon lament for decades, aired even by gen­er­a­tions too young to remem­ber those days them­selves. But mem­bers of any gen­er­a­tion can now relive them — or live them for the first time — through a new site called MTV Rewind.\nThe first music video that greets the vis­i­tor is The Bug­gles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star,” and appro­pri­ate­ly so, since it inau­gu­rat­ed MTV itself when it went live on August 1st, 1981. What fol­lows are all the rest of the videos played on that first day, like Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight,” Blondie’s “Rap­ture,” David Bowie’s “Boys Keep Swing­ing,” and Kate Bush’s “Wuther­ing Heights.”\n(Oth­er, less wide­ly remem­bered entries include no few­er than three songs by Cliff Richard, which speaks to the then-incom­plete for­ma­tion of the kind of pop-musi­cal cul­ture we still asso­ciate with MTV.) The site’s oth­er playlists recre­ate oth­er eras and genre-spe­cif­ic pro­grams, from 120 Min­utes to Total Request Live, Head­banger’s Ball to Yo! MTV Raps.\nCur­rent­ly, MTV Rewind’s music video count comes to about 40,000, enough to ensure any for­mer addict of the net­work a stream of nos­tal­gia hits. But the site’s cre­ator (a 43-year-old Amer­i­can res­i­dent in Alba­nia, accord­ing to the New York Times, known pseu­do­ny­mous­ly as “Flex”) has also incor­po­rat­ed vin­tage sta­tion IDs and com­mer­cials, many of them liable to trig­ger down­right Prous­t­ian sen­sa­tions in the right view­er. What may feel refresh­ing even to curi­ous younger vis­i­tors is that, whichev­er chan­nel they choose, the next video that plays is deter­mined not by an algo­rithm attempt­ing to pre­dict their per­son­al tastes. Rather, each playlist is shaped by the pop­u­lar cul­ture of a par­tic­u­lar era, with enough left-field selec­tions to keep it inter­est­ing: just the sort of thing in hopes of which we used to flip over to MTV, back when the idea of stream­ing video on our com­put­ers still sound­ed like sheer­est fan­ta­sy.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom cheese wedges and leafy greens to loaves of bread and freshly picked zucchini, Eléonore Joulin has a tendency for playing with her food. In the Brussels-based artist’s work, a loaf of challah transforms into a vase, while a melting round of Raclette—a cheese originating in Switzerland that’s scraped right off the wheel onto baguettes or potatoes—transforms into a lighting fixture.\nJoulin is known for her lighthearted lamps and vessels resembling vegetables, sausages, and other foods. She enjoys experimenting with glazes, handcrafting her own in order to find finishes and hues that create a trompe-l’œil effect—as if, for example, cabbage leaves were simply folded into the shape of shoes. The durability of ceramics adds a playful tension to her subject, as we expect greens to wither and bread to turn moldy, yet these never will.\n\nMost recently, Joulin spent nearly six months trying to create a glaze-and-texture combination that would mimic wood. “I tried a lot of different ways, including an oxide juice technique and a fake wood rubber tool used by carpenters, but I ended with a combination of three matte glazes,” she tells Colossal. “I’m thinking of doing a cuckoo clock now—stay tuned!”\nExplore even more on Joulin’s Instagram. You might also enjoy Stephanie Shih’s nods to “domestic bliss” and Naomi Peterson’s confectionary-inspired “cup-cakes.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nBefore he was a titan of Renaissance art history, Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) was a 12-year-old, although his childhood looked quite a bit different from what we associate with that age today. Already deeply invested in drawing and painting, he studied others’ work, such as an engraving titled “Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons,” created by 15th-century German artist Martin Schongauer. Unlike most tweens, though, when he set out to recreate the scene in tempera paint on a wood panel, he worked with a particular style that strongly hinted at the young boy’s preternatural talent.\nThis is the very first known painting by Michelangelo, titled “The Torment of Saint Anthony,” which was completed around 1487-88 at the age of 12 or 13. It wasn’t attributed to him until after the painting sold at auction in 2008 and a conservationist at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York removed yellowed varnish and some unskillful overpaint to reveal a unique color palette and attention to depth.\n\nArt historians such as Everett Fahy, a longtime curator at The Met, asserted that the painting had been made by Michelangelo, even though when the work went to auction, it was attributed more generally to the large Florentine workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, with which Michelangelo joined as an apprentice in 1488.\nFahy’s convictions were bolstered by the unique composition that emerged after its restoration at the hands of conservator Michael Gallagher, backed by art historian and restorer Giorgio Bonsanti’s expert opinion that it was indeed made by Michelangelo.\nWith no one else able (at least yet) to provide credible enough evidence that it was not, the work was acquired by the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, making it the only painting by the Renaissance master in a public collection in North America.\n“The rare subject is found in the life of Saint Anthony the Great, written by Athanasius of Alexandria in the 4th century, which describes how the Egyptian hermit-saint had a vision that he levitated into the air and was attacked by demons, whose torments he withstood,” says the Kimbell, adding that historians like Ascanio Condivi and Giorgio Vasari—Michelangelo’s contemporaries—recounted that “to give the demonic creatures veracity, he studied the colorful scales and other parts of specimens from the fish market.”\n\nIt’s possible that the famously exacting Michelangelo wouldn’t have chosen to have his name associated with this “amateur” work, which may help explain its attribution to the workshop instead. But for art historians and enthusiasts alike, it’s a wonderful insight into some of the artist’s earliest creative explorations. \nBelow, enjoy a video from art historian Erick Giraldo, who runs a channel called Inspiraggio on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen a 65-year-old tree succumbed to a fungus known as oak wilt, Steve Parker wanted to pay tribute. The wooded habitat had previously loomed above Parker’s front yard and provided refuge to migratory birds. Rather than turn its limbs and trunk into mulch, though, Parker did as he often does with a material that’s no longer primed for its original purpose: he created a sound sculpture.\nRecently on view at Ivester Contemporary in Austin, “Funeral for a Tree” is a sprawling and poetic ode to the oak. Parker cut slices from the trunk that he then carved like vinyl, encoding bird song into the grain. When placed on a Victrola-style turntable, the records play the avian soundscapes.\n\n\n\nTo accompany these dirges, Parker also constructed a suspended brass and copper sculpture with tubing that splays like roots, some of which display blue-bag ventilators at their tips. These medical devices appear alongside CPAP machines in another installation of bark-clad limbs and vintage instruments known as shengs sourced from a Taipei flea market. \nEmphasizing breath and the rhythmic pulse of life, these additions also reference the artist’s late father. “The project emerged from Parker’s recognition that his grief for the tree echoed the loss of his father to cancer—both slow, inevitable declines where care could not prevent loss,” a statement says.\nWatch “Funeral for a Tree” in the video above, and find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nTwo decades ago, a man named Rick Canty lost his mother and was shortly thereafter evicted from their home in Barry, Wales, due to bankruptcy charges he vehemently claimed were fraudulent. In protest against being forced to move, he climbed on top of the house and settled into a new routine on the rooftop, not just for a few days or weeks but for more than two years. Practically overnight, he became a local legend, and he inspired a unique sense of neighborly support that people still talk about in Barry.\nWelsh filmmaker Isaac Atkin-Mayne, who grew up in Barry and heard much about Canty over the years, was inspired to tell a story of community, camaraderie, and the extraordinary things that ordinary people are capable of in the face of adversity.\n\n\n\nAtkin-Mayne describes his short documentary, “Rick on the Roof,” as a glimpse inside of Canty’s “resolute and bit mad protest, but it’s also about a search for a kind of community that can feel rare today.” He especially responded to the notion of “strangers who are willing to support you through your struggle and make it their own, and 20 years later, remember those days as the most meaningful of their lives.”\nThe collaborative project includes archival footage captured by a local named Steven Toozer, who had initially planned to make a short film about Canty’s protest. Along with additional footage from news sources and other individuals, Atkin-Mayne adds a further dimension by including interviews with those who knew Canty personally. “This is a homegrown film about collective memory, retracing Rick’s story through the voices of those closest to him as a kind of visualised oral history,” Atkin-Mayne says.\nReleased amid the ongoing cost-of-living crisis in the U.K., “Rick on the Roof” delves into a story of how a quiet neighborhood rallied around an individual facing a truly unique set of circumstances. Neighbors sent food and essentials up to him via a bucket-and-pulley system, and even though the house was sold at auction in the summer of 2007, he continued to stay on the roof until he was forced off in late 2008.\n“Barry, like much of the U.K., is facing a stark rising cost of living that’s quietly affecting people in many different ways,” Atkin-Mayne says. “Our goal in remembering Rick’s story is to to renew a sense of togetherness through hardship and remind ourselves that we’re never alone.”\nRick Canty and his mother in front of their home in Barry, Wales\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen I retire, I plan to read every morning and bake bread from scratch. I’d like to resume Spanish classes and finally become fluent. And I plan to see movies mid-afternoon, take long, leisurely walks leading nowhere in particular, and travel as much as possible. Does this sound familiar? \nDreaming of retirement is one coping mechanism many of us tap into, including director John Kelly. Along with his co-writer Tara Lawall, Kelly created a charming animated “Retirement Plan” detailing all the things he’d finally like to do as an older person no longer tethered to the office. He intends to play a single song impeccably on the piano, finally organize the pantry, and take a hike—or better yet, understand what the point of taking a hike is. \n\n\n\nWith the ability to make viewers both laugh and cry, the short film captures both the excitement of anticipation and the sometimes lackluster reality of finally diving in. As one commenter points out, the animation also checks a particular item off the protagonist’s list: “write a devastating yet optimistic piece of poetry.”\nWatch “Retirement Plan” above, and spend the rest of the day envisioning all the things you plan to do in that dreamworld we call retirement. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo by Tiffany Camusci, courtesy Local 2110 UAW)\n    \n        \n            Staff at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City are officially unionized following a successful National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election, workers announced today, Friday, January 16.The formation of the Met Union under United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2110, which represents workers at cultural organizations across the city and elsewhere, comes months after staff first announced their intent to organize, cutting the need for pay parity, increased representation, and more transparency. Workers filed a petition with the NLRB, a step sometimes taken to form a union when the employing organization does not voluntarily recognize it, in November. The union will represent workers across 50 departments at the museum, including curators, librarians, conservators, visitor experience staff, and archivists. Originally, the union filed to represent 1,000 employees of the museum’s approximately 2,000-person workforce. Staff voted to form the union by a margin of 76%, with 542 voting in favor, 172 voting in opposition, and 100 not counted because the museum disputed their eligibility to belong to the union, according to UAW Local 2110.”We won because we were able to convince our colleagues that they don't have to accept whatever is offered to them, that their experience and hard work have earned them a seat at the table,” Rebecca Capua, a Met conservator, said in a statement released by UAW Local 2110.In a statement, a spokesperson for The Met said the institution “look[s] forward to engaging with the UAW as we pursue The Met’s mission to connect all people to creativity, knowledge, ideas, and one another.”“As one of the world’s leading art museums, The Met has long been committed to supporting its exceptional staff with highly competitive salaries and benefit packages that surpass industry standards; robust professional development opportunities; and a culture that values inclusivity, creativity, collaboration and excellence,” the spokesperson said. The institution said that over 600 of its employees earn more than $100,000 per year, and added that salaries have increased by 4% over the past five years. Alison Clark, a collections manager in the Asian Art Department, said in a statement that unionizing “is only our first step.”“We look forward to negotiating a fair and equitable contract that reflects staff needs and priorities,” Clark said.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Metropolitan Museum of Art\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Lat­er still, in 1972, that piece of music was adopt­ed by the Coun­cil of Europe as the con­ti­nen­t’s anthem; in 1985, the Euro­pean Union made it offi­cial as well.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/p5favl2Qtx0?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a sense, “Ode to Joy” is a nat­ur­al choice for a musi­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Europe, not just for its explic­it themes, but also for the obvi­ous ambi­tion of the sym­pho­ny that includes it to cap­ture an entire civ­i­liza­tion in musi­cal form.</p>\n<p>Its com­plex­i­ty and con­tra­dic­tion may be eas­i­er to appre­ci­ate through these videos, which con­sti­tute <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL865A414178BA4B6F\">a visu­al­iza­tion by Stephen Mali­nows­ki</a>, cre­ator of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/11/watch-classical-music-come-to-life-in-artfully-animated-scores.html\">Music Ani­ma­tion Machine</a>, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture for his ani­mat­ed scores of every­thing from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/?p=1122099\">Vivaldi’s <em>Four Sea­sons</em></a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/05/bachs_brandenburg_concerto_4_visualized_by_the_great_music_animation_machine.html\">Bach’s Bran­den­burg Con­cer­to no. 4</a> to Debussy’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/10/debussys-clair-de-lune.html\"><em>Clair de lune</em></a>.

Though already deaf, Beethoven nev­er­the­less com­posed this final com­plete sym­pho­ny with lay­er after ever-chang­ing yet inter­lock­ing lay­er, draw­ing from a vari­ety of musi­cal tra­di­tions as well as pieces he’d already writ­ten for oth­er pur­pos­es.

Final­ly, a chance to catch up on all the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/07/how-to-read-many-more-books-in-a-year.html\">read­ing</a> we’ve been mean­ing to do. Final­ly, an envi­ron­ment con­ducive to this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/09/meditation-for-beginners.html\">med­i­ta­tion</a> thing about whose ben­e­fits we’ve heard so much. (Per­haps we made those very assur­ances to our­selves when the COVID-19 pan­dem­ic set in.) But accord­ing to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USW8yf4L-R4\">the ani­mat­ed TED-Ed les­son above</a>, writ­ten by psy­chi­a­trist and cor­rec­tion­al men­tal health expert Ter­ry Kupers, the neg­a­tives of the expe­ri­ence would well out­weigh the pos­i­tives. It all comes by way of answer­ing the ques­tion, “What hap­pens to your brain with­out any social con­tact?”</p>\n<p>Unsur­pris­ing­ly, per­haps, iso­la­tion takes its great­est toll when imposed against the will of the iso­lat­ed, and even more so when imposed for an indef­i­nite dura­tion. “Ear­ly on, stress hor­mones may spike, and as time pass­es, that stress can become chron­ic,” says the video’s nar­ra­tor.</p>\n<p>With­out the avail­abil­i­ty of social inter­ac­tions as “a sound­ing board where we can gauge how ratio­nal our per­cep­tions are,” one’s “sense of iden­ti­ty and real­i­ty becomes threat­ened.” The stage is there­fore set for “depres­sion, obses­sions, sui­ci­dal ideation, and, for some, delu­sions and hal­lu­ci­na­tions.” Sleep­ing dif­fi­cul­ties can man­i­fest on the more strict­ly phys­i­cal end, poten­tial­ly accom­pa­nied by “heart pal­pi­ta­tions, headaches, dizzi­ness, and hyper­sen­si­tiv­i­ty.”</p>\n<p>While trav­el­ing in the Unit­ed States, Charles Dick­ens bore wit­ness to the pun­ish­ment by soli­tary con­fine­ment already in effect in Amer­i­can pris­ons, com­ing away with the impres­sion that it was “worse than any tor­ture of the body.” He wrote that after a vis­it to a Philadel­phia pen­i­ten­tiary, whose very name reflects the the­o­ry, held by the Quak­er groups who intro­duced the prac­tice in the late eigh­teenth cen­tu­ry, that it could “bring about reflec­tion and pen­i­tence.” After much research on the mat­ter, Kupers has come to the con­clu­sion that, in fact, it “does immense dam­age that is con­trary to reha­bil­i­ta­tion, while fail­ing to reduce prison vio­lence.” If you’re read­ing this, you may not be espe­cial­ly like­ly to be sen­tenced to invol­un­tary con­fine­ment. But the next time you start feel­ing out of sorts for rea­sons you can’t pin down, con­sid­er how long it’s been since you’ve spent real time with real peo­ple.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/11/what-happens-when-you-spend-weeks-months-or-years-in-solitary-confinement.html\">What Hap­pens When You Spend Weeks, Months, or Years in Soli­tary Con­fine­ment</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/01/how-loneliness-is-killing-us-a-primer-from-harvard-psychiatrist-zen-priest-robert-waldinger.html\">How Lone­li­ness Is Killing Us: A Primer from Har­vard Psy­chi­a­trist & Zen Priest Robert Waldinger</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2014/10/when-modern-art-was-used-as-torture-during-the-spanish-civil-war.html\">Mod­ern Art Was Used As a Tor­ture Tech­nique in Prison Cells Dur­ing the Span­ish Civ­il War</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/09/what-an-85-year-long-harvard-study-says-is-the-real-key-to-happiness.html\">What an 85-Year-Long Har­vard Study Says Is the Real Key to Hap­pi­ness</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/08/on-the-power-of-teaching-philosophy-in-prisons.html\">On the Pow­er of Teach­ing Phi­los­o­phy in Pris­ons</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

But the life to which Borges attach­es his labyrinths is a librar­i­an’s life; the strands that anchor his fic­tions are the obscure schol­ar­ly ref­er­ences he weaves through­out his text. Borges brings this ten­den­cy to whim­si­cal employ in his non­fic­tion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3auGKng\"><em>Book of Imag­i­nary Beings</em>,</a> a het­ero­ge­neous com­pendi­um of crea­tures from ancient folk­tale, myth, and demonolo­gy around the world.</p>\n<p>Borges him­self some­times remarks on how these ancient sto­ries can float too far away from rati­o­ci­na­tion. The “absurd hypothe­ses” regard­ing the myth­i­cal Greek Chimera, for exam­ple, “are proof” that the ridicu­lous beast “was begin­ning to bore peo­ple…. A vain or fool­ish fan­cy is the def­i­n­i­tion of Chimera that we now find in dic­tio­nar­ies.” Of  what he calls “Jew­ish Demons,” a cat­e­go­ry too numer­ous to parse, he writes, “a cen­sus of its pop­u­la­tion left the bounds of arith­metic far behind.</p>\n<p>Through­out the cen­turies, Egypt, Baby­lo­nia, and Per­sia all enriched this teem­ing mid­dle world.” Although a less­er field than angelol­o­gy, the influ­ence of this fas­ci­nat­ing­ly diverse canon only broad­ened over time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“The natives record­ed in the Tal­mud” soon became “thor­ough­ly inte­grat­ed” with the many demons of Chris­t­ian Europe and the Islam­ic world, form­ing a sprawl­ing hell whose denizens hail from at least three con­ti­nents, and who have mixed freely in alchem­i­cal, astro­log­i­cal, and oth­er occult works since at least the 13th cen­tu­ry and into the present. One exam­ple from the ear­ly 20th cen­tu­ry, a 1902 trea­tise on div­ina­tion from Isfa­han, a city in cen­tral Iran, draws on this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/demons-and-demonology\">ancient thread</a> with a series of water­col­ors added in 1921 that could eas­i­ly be mis­tak­en for illus­tra­tions from the ear­ly Mid­dle Ages.</p>\n<p>As <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/persian-demons-from-a-book-of-magic-and-astrology-1921\">the Pub­lic Domain Review notes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The won­der­ful images draw on Near East­ern demono­log­i­cal tra­di­tions that stretch back mil­len­nia — to the days when the rab­bis of the Baby­lon­ian Tal­mud <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/109188/the-talmuds-many-demons\">assert­ed</a> it was a bless­ing demons were invis­i­ble, since, “if the eye would be grant­ed per­mis­sion to see, no crea­ture would be able to stand in the face of the demons that sur­round it.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The author of the trea­tise, a <em>ram­mal</em>, or sooth­say­er, him­self “attrib­ut­es his knowl­edge to the Bib­li­cal Solomon, who was known for his pow­er over demons and spir­its,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ajammc.com/2017/10/31/demons-licking-toes/\">writes Ali Kar­joo-Ravary</a>, now an assis­tant pro­fes­sor of Islam­ic his­to­ry at Colum­bia Uni­ver­si­ty. Pre­dat­ing Islam, “the depic­tion of demons in the Near East… was fre­quent­ly used for mag­i­cal and tal­is­man­ic pur­pos­es,” just as it was by occultists like Aleis­ter Crow­ley at the time these illus­tra­tions were made.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“Not all of the 56 paint­ed illus­tra­tions in the man­u­script depict demon­ic beings,” the Pub­lic Domain Review points out. “Amongst the horned and fork-tongued we also find the archangels Jibrāʾīl (Gabriel) and Mikāʾīl (Michael), as well as the ani­mals — lion, lamb, crab, fish, scor­pi­on — asso­ci­at­ed with the zodi­ac.” But in the main, it’s demon city. What would Borges have made of these fan­tas­tic images? No doubt, had he seen them, and he had seen plen­ty of their like before he lost his sight, he would have been delight­ed.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>A blue man with claws, four horns, and a pro­ject­ing red tongue is no less fright­en­ing for the fact that he’s wear­ing a can­dy-striped loin­cloth. In anoth­er image we see a mous­ta­chioed goat man with tuber-nose and pol­ka dot skin mani­a­cal­ly con­coct­ing a less-than-appetis­ing dish. One recur­ring (and wor­ry­ing) theme is demons vis­it­ing sleep­ers in their beds, scenes involv­ing such pleas­ant activ­i­ties as tooth-pulling, eye-goug­ing, and — in one of the most engross­ing illus­tra­tions — a bout of foot-lick­ing (per­formed by a rep­til­ian feline with a shark-toothed tail).</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s a play­ful Boschi­an qual­i­ty to all of this, but while we tend to see Bosch’s work from our per­spec­tive as absurd, he appar­ent­ly took his bizarre inven­tions absolute­ly seri­ous­ly. So too, we might assume, did the illus­tra­tor here. We might won­der, as Woolf did, about this work as the prod­uct of “suf­fer­ing human beings… attached to gross­ly mate­r­i­al things, like health and mon­ey and the hous­es we live in.” What kinds of ordi­nary, mate­r­i­al con­cerns might have afflict­ed this artist, as he (we pre­sume) imag­ined demons goug­ing the eyes and lick­ing the feet of peo­ple tucked safe­ly in their beds?</p>\n<p>See many more of these strange paint­ings at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/persian-demons-from-a-book-of-magic-and-astrology-1921\">the Pub­lic Domain Review</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-293x360.jpg 293w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-195x240.jpg 195w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-300x369.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-293x360.jpg 293w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-195x240.jpg 195w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-300x369.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-300x379.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-300x379.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/04/persian-manuscripts-spanning-700-years-now-digitized-and-available-online.html\">700 Years of Per­sian Man­u­scripts Now Dig­i­tized and Avail­able Online</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to 2,178 Occult Books Now Digitized & Put Online, Thanks to the Ritman Library and <i>Da Vinci Code</i> Author Dan Brown\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/08/2178-occult-books-now-digitized-put-online.html\">2,178 Occult Books Now Dig­i­tized & Put Online, Thanks to the Rit­man Library and <i>Da Vin­ci Code</i> Author Dan Brown</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/12/160000-pages-of-glorious-medieval-manuscripts-digitized.html\">160,000 Pages of Glo­ri­ous Medieval Man­u­scripts Dig­i­tized: Vis­it the Bib­lio­the­ca Philadel­phien­sis</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>",

That artist is known for her immersive <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/chiharu-shiota\">string installations</a>, inviting us into emotive, atmospheric experiences that tap into both universal and deeply personal narratives.</p>\n<p>In <em>Two Home Countries</em>, viewers enter a vivid world shaped by red thread, redolent of intertwined veins and blood vessels that attach to the floor, take on the shapes of houses, and spread through an entire room with a cloud-like aura of red—filled with written pages. Themes of memory, mortality, connection, identity, and belonging weave through Shiota’s pieces, exploring “how pain, displacement, boundaries, and existential uncertainty shape the human condition and our understanding of self,” the gallery says.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of a full-room installation of red fiber and paper pages by Chiharu Shiota\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-640x461.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-960x692.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-768x554.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-1536x1107.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Diary” (2025) in ‘Chiharu Shiota: Two Home Countries’ at Japan Society Gallery, New York, 2025</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An expansive, room-sized work titled “Diary,” which is based on an <a href=\"https://www.chiharu-shiota.com/diary-1\" target=\"_blank\">earlier installation</a> and commissioned anew for <em>Two Home Countries, </em>incorporates a dense web of yarn in which float pages of journals that once belonged to Japanese soldiers. Some were also penned by German civilians in the post-war era. “The accumulated pages reveal an expansive record of shared human existence across national boundaries,” the gallery says.</p>\n<p>“When the body is gone, the objects which surrounded them remain behind,” Shiota says in a statement. “As I wander the stalls of the markets in Berlin, I find especially personal items like photographs, old passports, and personal diaries. Once, I found a diary from 1946, which was an intimate insight into the person’s life and experiences.” For Shiota, the power of these objects are revealed in how she feels the presence of writer’s “inner self.”</p>\n<p><em>Two Home Countries </em>is on view through January 11 in New York City.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Throughout history, those who wield the most power or resources are typically the ones whose stories are represented in textbooks, passed down through generations, and etched into our collective consciousness. Without intentional effort, it can be difficult to hear more than a single narrative.</p>\n<p>In art history, the reality is much the same. The canon has always privileged white male artists, from titans of the Renaissance like Michelangelo to bad-boy American Modernists like Jackson Pollock. The foundations of 19th-century American landscape painting, for example, are inextricable from the belief in Manifest Destiny, as the American government violently expanded westward. And Western painting and sculpture have historically reigned supreme in the market-driven hallows of galleries and auction houses. But what of the incredible breadth of—namely Indigenous—art forms that have long been overlooked?</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8.jpg\" alt=\"a columnar, geometric sculpture by Dyani White Hawk coated in patterns of beadwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-1366x2048.jpg 1366w\" /><figcaption>“Visiting” (2024), acrylic, glass beads, thread, and synthetic sinew on aluminum panel with a quartz base, 120 x 15.5 x 15.5 inches (base 5 x 24 x 24 inches).

White Hawk draws a similar parallel between the 20th-century Color Field and Minimalism movements to highlight the influence of Native American art forms in the evolution of these styles. She prompts viewers to consider how these notions shape our aesthetic perceptions and judgment while also considering the role of cultural memory and community.</p>\n<p>White Hawk’s work spans painting, sculpture, photography, performance, and installations. Alongside oil and acrylic paint, she incorporates materials commonly used in Lakota art forms, like beads, porcupine quills, and buckskin.</p>\n<p>“I strive to create honest, inclusive works that draw from the breadth of my life experiences,” White Hawk says in a statement, merging influences from Native and non-Native, urban, academic, and cultural education systems. She continues: “This allows me to start from center, deepening my own understanding of the intricacies of self and culture, correlations between personal and national history, and Indigenous and mainstream art histories.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5.jpg\" alt=\"a geometric patterned wall installation by Dyani White Hawk of a Native American pattern\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-640x368.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-960x552.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-768x442.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-1536x884.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Nourish” (2024), ceramic tile installation of handmade tiles by Mercury Mosaics, 174 x 369 1/2 inches.

Vibrant geometric patterns are direct and visceral in a way that “unsettles the categories of Eurocentric art history,” the galleries say.</p>\n<p>White Hawk notes that her mixed-media canvases honor “the importance of the contributions of Lakota women and Indigenous artists to our national artistic history…as well as the ways in which Indigenous artists helped shape the evolution of the practices of Western artists who were inspired by their work.”</p>\n<p>“Nourish,” an installation that spans nearly 31 feet wide and 14.5 feet tall, comprises thousands of handmade ceramic tiles that visually reference Lakota beadwork and quillwork. Permanently installed at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the piece enters into a dialogue with the history of American Modernism through painters such as Marsden Hartley and Pollock, who are credited as trailblazers of American abstraction and yet were indelibly influenced by Native American art.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of a geometric sculpture by Dyani White Hawk coated in patterns of beadwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-1366x2048.jpg 1366w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Visiting.” Collection of the Denver Art Museum. Photo by Rik Sferra</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“At its core, White Hawk’s practice is sustained by ancestral respect and guided by value systems that center relationality and care for all life,” the galleries say. “By addressing inequities affecting Native communities, she creates opportunities for cross-cultural connection and prompts a critical examination of how artistic and national histories have been constructed. Her work invites viewers to evaluate current societal value systems and their capacity to support equitable futures.”</p>\n<p>Minneapolis-based Bockley Gallery, which has represented White Hawk for more than a decade, has recently announced co-representation of the artist with New York City-based Alexander Gray Associates, where she’ll present a solo exhibition in fall 2026. If you’re in Minneapolis, <em>Love Language </em>opens on October 18 at the <a href=\"https://walkerart.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Walker Art Center</a> and continues through February 15. The show then travels to <a href=\"https://remaimodern.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Remai Modern</a> in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where it will be on view from April 25 to September 27, 2026.

While Craig is based in New York, and Karl is based in London, the two collaborate across the pond—and around the world—to produce multimedia installations that revitalize urban spaces and celebrate the power of play.</p>\n<p>As part of the 2025 <a href=\"https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Brisbane Festival</a>, Craig & Karl created a pair of large-scale inflatable interventions on two of the city’s bridges, both riffing on the idea of the arch as passageway. Additionally, numerous illustrations, interactive sculptures, and inflatable “Mateys” — a series of quirky characters with expressive faces — pop up on buildings and sidewalks to enable joyful encounters as part of the expansive, city-wide exhibition titled <em>Rear Vision.</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg\" alt=\"colorful, inflatable arches by Craig & Karl are installed on a long bridge in Bisbrane, illuminated at night\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Walk This Way” (2025), Kangaroo Point Bridge, Brisbane. Photo by JD Lin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Collectively<em> </em>titled “Walk This Way,” the bridge installations encourage Brisbanites to see their city with fresh eyes. The expressive, flexible characters are also immanently relatable for viewers of all ages. “The Mateys serve as companions that help foster community and shared experiences, welcoming us into different corners of the city,” says a festival statement.</p>\n<p>Craig & Karl are known for their vivid participatory projects, which range from mini-golf courses to playgrounds to murals. The artists initially met 30 years ago while studying at Griffith University in Brisbane, and since, their collaborative practice has included partnerships with global brands and publications like Adidas, Nike, Apple, Chanel, <em>The New Yorker, Variety, </em>and more.</p>\n<p>While the bridge installations came to a close at the end of September, you can still stroll along the <em>Public Art Trail</em> through October 20 to spot Craig & Karl’s sculptures and installations in unexpected places. Then, drop by the exhibition <em>Double Vision </em>at the Griffith University Art Museum, which continues through January 7.</p>\n<p>Plot your course on the Brisbane Festival <a href=\"https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, and see more of the artists’ projects on <a href=\"https://www.craigandkarl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">their site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/craigandkarl\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449.jpg\" alt=\"a woman stands in front of an inflatable sculpture by Craig & Karl of abstract, worm-like forms with smiley faces\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-640x823.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-960x1235.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-768x988.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-1194x1536.jpg 1194w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-7-e1759328500449-1592x2048.jpg 1592w\" /><figcaption>“Mateys” (2025), part of ‘Rear Vision’ Public Art Trail, Brisbane.

    "body": "\n\tin Film, Technology |   \tJanuary 19th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen Net­flix launched around the turn of the mil­len­ni­um, it was received as a god­send by many Amer­i­can cinephiles, espe­cial­ly those who lived nowhere near diverse­ly pro­grammed revival hous­es or well-curat­ed video stores. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry lat­er, it’s safe to say that those days have come to an end. Not only does the stream­ing-only Net­flix of the twen­ty-twen­ties no longer trans­mit movies on DVD through the mail (a ser­vice its younger users have trou­ble even imag­in­ing), it ranks approx­i­mate­ly nowhere as a pre­ferred cinephile des­ti­na­tion. That has to do with a selec­tion much dimin­ished since the DVD days — espe­cial­ly as regards movies more than a decade or so old — but also with a brand debased by too many bland, for­mu­la­ic orig­i­nal pro­duc­tions.\nUnlike the plat­for­m’s var­i­ous acclaimed mul­ti-episode dra­mat­ic series, the “Net­flix movie” com­mands no crit­i­cal respect. But it can, at least if you trust the com­pa­ny’s own view­er­ship data, com­mand a large audi­ence, if not an espe­cial­ly atten­tive one. The gen­er­al semi-engage­ment of Net­flix view­ers, as argued in the Nerd­stal­gic video at the top of the post, is reflect­ed in the qual­i­ty of the “movie-shaped prod­uct” now served to them. \nFar from the slapped-togeth­er approx­i­ma­tions of Hol­ly­wood we once expect­ed from films made for TV, the stream-chart-top­ping likes of Red Notice and The Elec­tric State are mega-bud­get­ed pro­duc­tions brim­ming with big stars and large-scale visu­al effects. They’re also tis­sues of algo­rithm-approved nar­ra­tive ele­ments, bor­rowed imagery, and third-hand quips, all of them for­got­ten as soon as the next piece of con­tent begins auto-play­ing.\n\n\n\t\n\nOn the lat­est Joe Rogan Expe­ri­ence pod­cast, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon turned up to pro­mote their own Net­flix movie, The Rip. They don’t take long to open up about the dis­tinc­tive chal­lenges of work­ing for that plat­form in this era. Damon men­tions that, where­as action movies once saved their explo­sion-inten­sive set pieces for after the sto­ry gets in motion, Net­flix asks, “Can we get a big one in the first five min­utes? We want peo­ple to stay tuned in. And it wouldn’t be ter­ri­ble if you reit­er­at­ed the plot three or four times in the dia­logue because peo­ple are on their phones while they’re watch­ing.” Accord­ing to the film­mak­ers who speak about it, the needs of these so-called “sec­ond screen” view­ers have assumed great impor­tance in the stu­dio notes offered by Net­flix — which has, at this point, become a major stu­dio in itself.\n\n\n\t\n\nSat­is­fy­ing the appar­ent demands of Net­flix’s met­rics results in what Nerd­stal­gic calls “visu­al muzak,” geared to hold out just enough famil­iar­i­ty and pres­tige to get users to press play, with­out ever call­ing so much atten­tion to itself that they press stop. This makes the stu­dio pic­tures of the nineties, when Affleck and Damon broke out, look like the stuff of a gold­en age. “There were a lot of real­ly good inde­pen­dent movies that were being made,” Damon remem­bers. “They were mak­ing dar­ing movies, and every­one just got way more con­ser­v­a­tive.” On one lev­el, stream­ing plat­forms have great­ly widened access to film in gen­er­al; on anoth­er, they’ve sti­fled artis­tic indi­vid­u­al­i­ty and risk-tak­ing on the part of actu­al films. As Quentin Taran­ti­no has point­ed out, tech­nol­o­gy and eco­nom­ics put main­stream cin­e­ma into peri­ods of cre­ative retrench­ment every so often: the fifties, for exam­ple, or the eight­ies. Whether anoth­er sev­en­ties or nineties lies ahead, today’s cinephiles can only hope.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWho Is Killing Cin­e­ma?: A Mur­der Mys­tery Iden­ti­fies the Cul­tur­al & Eco­nom­ic Cul­prits\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Like Movies Any­more: The Rise of Meta­mod­ernist Films, and How They Grew Out of Mod­ernism & Post­mod­ernism\nHow the “Mar­veliza­tion” of Cin­e­ma Accel­er­ates the Decline of Film­mak­ing\nThe Decay of Cin­e­ma: Susan Son­tag, Mar­tin Scors­ese & Their Lamen­ta­tions on the Decline of Cin­e­ma Explored in a New Video Essay\nWhy We All Need Sub­ti­tles Now\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nI have tak­en more out of alco­hol than alco­hol has tak­en out of me. — Win­ston Churchill\nWin­ston Churchill had a rep­u­ta­tion as a bril­liant states­man and a prodi­gious drinker.\nThe for­mer prime min­is­ter imbibed through­out the day, every day.  He also burned through 10 dai­ly cig­ars, and lived to the ripe old age of 90.\nHis come­back to Field Mar­shal Bernard Mont­gomery’s boast that he nei­ther smoked nor drank, and was 100 per­cent fit was “I drink and smoke, and I am 200 per­cent fit.”\nFirst Lady Eleanor Roo­sevelt mar­veled “that any­one could smoke so much and drink so much and keep per­fect­ly well.”\nIn No More Cham­pagne: Churchill and His Mon­ey, author David Lough doc­u­ments Churchill’s dis­as­trous alco­hol expens­es, as well as the bot­tle count at Chartwell, his Ken­tish res­i­dence. Here’s the tal­ly for March 24,1937:\n180 bot­tles and 30 half bot­tles of Pol Roger cham­pagne\n20 bot­tles and 9 half bot­tles of oth­er cham­pagne\n100+ bot­tles of claret\n117 bot­tles and 389 half bot­tles of Barsac\n13 bot­tles of brandy\n5 bot­tles of cham­pagne brandy\n7 bot­tles of liqueur whisky\n\nAll that liquor was not going to drink itself.\nDid Churchill have a hol­low leg?  An extra­or­di­nar­i­ly high tol­er­ance? An uncan­ny abil­i­ty to mask his intox­i­ca­tion?\nWhiskey som­me­li­er Rex Williams, a founder of the Whiskey Tribe YouTube chan­nel, and pod­cast host Andrew Heaton endeav­or to find out, above, by ded­i­cat­ing a day to the British Bulldog’s drink­ing reg­i­men.\nThey’re not the first to under­take such a fol­ly.\nThe Dai­ly Telegraph’s Har­ry Wal­lop doc­u­ment­ed a sim­i­lar adven­ture in 2015, wind­ing up queasy, and to judge by his 200 spelling mis­takes, cog­ni­tive­ly impaired.\nWilliams and Heaton’s on-cam­era exper­i­ment achieves a Drunk His­to­ry vibe and tell­tale flushed cheeks.\nHere’s the drill, not that we advise try­ing it at home:\nBREAKFAST\nAn eye open­er of John­nie Walk­er Red — just a splash — mixed with soda water to the rim.\nFol­low with more of the same through­out the morn­ing.\nThis is how Churchill, who often con­duct­ed his morn­ing busi­ness abed in a dress­ing gown, man­aged to aver­age between 1 — 3 ounces of alco­hol before lunch.\nAppar­ent­ly he devel­oped a taste for it as a young sol­dier post­ed in what is now Pak­istan, when Scotch not only improved the fla­vor of plain water, ‘once one got the knack of it, the very repul­sion from the fla­vor devel­oped an attrac­tion of its own.”\nAfter a morn­ing spent sip­ping the stuff, Heaton reports feel­ing “play­ful and jokey, but not yet vio­lent.”\nLUNCH\nTime for “an ambi­tious quo­ta of cham­pagne!”\nChurchill’s pre­ferred brand was Pol Roger, though he wasn’t averse to Giesler, Moet et Chan­don, or Pom­mery,  pur­chased from the upscale wine and spir­its mer­chant Ran­dolph Payne & Sons,  whose let­ter­head iden­ti­fied them as sup­pli­ers to “Her Majesty The Late Queen Vic­to­ria and to The Late King William The Fourth.”\nChurchill enjoyed his impe­r­i­al pint of cham­pagne from a sil­ver tankard, like a “prop­er Edwar­dian gent” accord­ing to his life­long friend, Odette Pol-Roger.\nWilliams and Heaton take theirs in flutes accom­pa­nied by fish sticks from the freez­er case. This is the point beyond which a hang­over is all but assured.\nLunch con­cludes with a post-pran­di­al cognac, to set­tle the stom­ach and begin the diges­tion process.\nChurchill, who declared him­self a man of sim­ple tastes — I am eas­i­ly sat­is­fied with the best — would have insist­ed on some­thing from the house of Hine.\nRESTORATIVE  AFTERNOON NAP\nThis seems to be a crit­i­cal ele­ment of Churchill’s alco­hol man­age­ment suc­cess. He fre­quent­ly allowed him­self as much as 90 min­utes to clear the cob­webs.\nA nap def­i­nite­ly pulls our re-enac­tors out of their tail spins. Heaton emerges ready to “bluff (his) way through a meet­ing.”\nTEATIME\nI guess we can call it that, giv­en the tim­ing.\nNo tea though.\nJust a steady stream of extreme­ly weak scotch and sodas to take the edge off of admin­is­tra­tive tasks.\nDINNER\nMore cham­pagne!!! More cognac!!!\n“This should be the apex of our wit,” a bleary Heaton tells his belch­ing com­pan­ion, who fess­es up to vom­it­ing upon wak­ing the next day.\nTheir con­clu­sion? Churchill’s reg­i­men is unmanageable…at least for them.\nAnd pos­si­bly also for Churchill.\nAs fel­low Scotch enthu­si­ast Christo­pher Hitchens revealed in a 2002 arti­cle in The Atlantic, some of Churchill’s most famous radio broad­casts, includ­ing his famous pledge to “fight on the beach­es” after the Mir­a­cle of Dunkirk, were voiced by a pinch hit­ter:\nNor­man Shel­ley, who played Win­nie-the-Pooh for the BBC’s Children’s Hour, ven­tril­o­quized Churchill for his­to­ry and fooled mil­lions of lis­ten­ers. Per­haps Churchill was too much inca­pac­i­tat­ed by drink to deliv­er the speech­es him­self.\nOr per­haps the great man mere­ly felt he’d earned the right to unwind with a glass of Graham’s Vin­tage Char­ac­ter Port, a Fine Old Amon­til­la­do Sher­ry or a Fine Old Liquor brandy, as was his wont.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nWin­ston Churchill Gets a Doctor’s Note to Drink Unlim­it­ed Alco­hol While Vis­it­ing the U.S. Dur­ing Pro­hi­bi­tion (1932)\nWin­ston Churchill’s Paint­ings: Great States­man, Sur­pris­ing­ly Good Artist\nOh My God!

In the side gallery, black and white dots drift across the walls, orbiting “and it’s the thing again” (2025) and “ayoyo’s warmness” (2025) like dust motes or scattering seeds. The former, a painting of a creature with a black snakelike body, a white circular head, and a bright orange eye against frantic red and yellow marks, formally echoes the nearby “the thing #1” (2023), a sculpture of a streetlight springing out of a mound of soil, its body marked with a knotted silk scarf that seems to suggest anthropomorphism. In the latter, red dots dance on geometrically divided zones of densely colored, largely monochrome blocks, evoking patterns of East African tapestry. A line of black tassels hangs from the painted linen, recalling the artist’s earlier years in the fashion world.In this room, other smaller works extend that sense of fluidity with quick, brutish charm. Blunt, almost childish brushstrokes, made without any evidence of hesitation, create free forms vaguely recognizable — the tilt of a house’s roof, the triangular silhouette of a mountain, the circle of a sun. A line lunges, reverses, and turns into a wing; a smear of green and blue pushes against a fog of pink; orange orbs hover as if arranged by chance. Rather than posturing toward an encrypted biography, these works turn outward, as if capturing and sharing a slippery memory before it evaporates. The paintings’ red borders — soft, hazy, sometimes glowing — give the impression of aura or heat, the emotional fringe of an image distantly recalled rather than observed. For Uman, images don’t hold still. They are expressions of restless meanings, always slipping into other territories moments later.Uman, \"and it’s the thing again\" (2025), acrylic, enamel, oil, and oil stick on canvasUman’s looping, colliding marks build toward a messiness that feels both impulsive and deliberate, but the paintings never chase virtuosity, sidestepping the sense of transcendence promised by abstract artists like Rothko. It doesn’t feel like she is painting toward escape, but rather toward the world as she carries it: the irrevocable loss of childhood Somalia; the landscapes of Upstate New York that both recall and forestall that original home, performing both delights and failures; and private interior terrains. These paintings suggest to me finding home in places far from the land that first formed her.In “melancholia in a snowy walk” (2025), for instance, a field of spiraling curls and morphing spines form a swirling pastoral scene that feels nearly cosmic. It, along other larger canvases, is installed against deep red walls that infuse the room with a primordial atmosphere that seems to expand the smaller works’ searching energy into vast, surreal compositions. In “first class, window seat” (2025), wavy grids ripple and bend, behaving like an ecstatic meadow of primal colors and suggesting woven textiles, irrigated fields, and the impossible geometry stitching together a life across continents. Up close, stars and cells emerge but never cohere into a realist observation. “melancholia in a fall breeze” (2025) turns fully toward dream logic, immediate yet also mysterious: Pink tides rise beside fluctuating planets. Red circles congregate and reproduce wildly. A wheel-like form glows with neon precision. In “amazing grace glorious morning” (2025), four red circular forms bloom in a row. Are they drums, fruits, or breasts? Nothing is literal, but everything feels inhabited, longingly reconstructed from art-historical fragments, stories, and inherited memories. Across the exhibition, Uman’s symbols remain deliberately opaque. Circles, spirals, arrows, and nests of marks flirt with legibility but refuse translation. That refusal feels not like coyness, but protection — keeping the complexity of diasporic experience intact, unflattened, and unclaimed. Ultimately, what lingers is how these paintings inhabit the space between recognition and estrangement. A sun looks like an eye. A hill looks like a shoulder. A memory looks like weather. Uman paints the distance between the homeland one loses and the homeland one tries, again and again, to dream back into existence. In her hands, abstraction becomes not an escape from history but a vessel for carrying what official records refuse or cannot speak aloud.Uman, \"melancholia in a snowy walk\" (2025), acrylic, oil, oil stick on canvasUman, \"amazing grace glorious morning\" (2025), acrylic, oil, oil stick on canvasUman, \"ayoyo’s warmness\" (2025), oil, oil stick, and mixed media on linenUman, \"diamonds in the sky\" (2024–25), acrylic, enamel, oil, and oil stick on canvasUman, \"tear it all up\" (2024–25), acrylic, enamel, oil, and oil stick on canvasUman: After all the things ... continues at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (258 Main Street, Ridgefield, Connecticut), through May 10.

Like the freedoms we often take for granted, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was hard-won. The designation of the third Monday in January as an official holiday commemorating the legacy of this momentous civil rights leader came after a 15-year battle waged by activists and grassroots groups who, despite pushback from Congress, refused to back down. They knew that there was something powerful about coming together to reflect on the lessons Dr. King left us, and that inscribing a dedicated day in the federal calendar was a way of agreeing, collectively, that he cannot be forgotten.Today, Hyperallergic celebrates Dr. King's outsized contributions as well as the labor and perseverance of those who ensured his remembrance.

But we shouldn't be surprised that San Francisco's tech titans didn't step in to save it, writes Christian L. Frock: The loss of CCA should be considered in relation to staggering wealth disparities and lack of social investment, primarily perpetuated by the technology sector, much of which has tight alliances with today’s leadership in Washington, DC.

Born in Santiago, Chile, in 1943, Rosenfeld came of age under conditions that made such interference urgent. Her most iconic action, “Una milla de cruces sobre el pavimento\" (One Mile of Crosses on the Pavement, 1979), was first carried out on Avenida Manquehue across the presidential palace in the early years of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. She attached white tape and bandages onto dashed traffic lines, transforming them into a trail of accumulated crosses. Grainy black-and-white footage follows Rosenfeld's slow processional march, her body bending forward to inscribe a disobedient line. The marks read sequentially as a tally — one that adds up the dead, the disappeared, the state’s sanctioned silences. But it is also an improbable insistence that something additive and charged with possibility might still emerge from the negative. Rosenfeld repeated the action throughout the 1980s and beyond, from the Atacama Desert (March 1981) to outside the White House in Washington, DC (June 1982), letting the line migrate across sociopolitical contexts while retaining its unruly charge.Installation view of Lotty Rosenfeld, \"I - +\" (1987), video with color and sound. 14 min. 51 sec.The line that is made to misbehave shows up across many works, like in the video “I - +” (1987), in which a horizontal band plays footage of her street crossings, slicing through a vertical column of state-controlled broadcast — including Pinochet rallies and Reagan-era posturing — to form a luminous cross. On a small TV monitor, the split screen reads as a quiet hijacking of the state’s visual field, punctuated by the intermittent scroll of the phrase “Esta línea es mi arma” (This line is my weapon), a caption that names Rosenfeld’s register of breach.Disobedient Spaces emphasizes the networks of exchange and mutual support that shaped Rosenfeld’s practice. Moments when Rosenfeld worked alongside Cecilia Vicuña and writer Diamela Eltit situate her within a network where activism and poetry were mutually sustaining. Archival posters, pamphlets, and correspondence document Rosenfeld’s work as a founding member of Colectivo Acciones de Arte (CADA), including \"Para no morir de hambre en el arte\" (How not to die of hunger in art, 1979), when the group redistributed bags of milk in low-income neighborhoods of Santiago. Milk carried particular weight in Chilean public life. It was central to Allende’s nutrition programs, and under Pinochet’s dictatorship, it transformed into a marker of scarcity and a symbol of the rapid dismantling of social welfare. Left: CADA, \"Bolsa de leche vacía con intervención\" (1979/2025), photograph; right: CADA, \"Bolsa de leche vacía con intervención\" (1979/2025), photographCADA coordinated further actions across the city, from a procession of milk trucks to full-page newspaper ads and interventions at cultural institutions, eventually sealing 100 milk bags and a manifesto inside an acrylic box, to be reopened only when the public regained access to their unmet basic needs. The title “How not to die of hunger in art” might read at first as a familiar problem of artists’ precarity, but it signals that survival under authoritarian rule requires both sustenance and nerve — both something to live on and something to stand for.For CADA, that meant refusing to let artistic discourse remain insulated from the social urgencies surrounding it and instead moving directly into the street — inviting participation, unsettling routines, and demanding visibility. This is most clearly seen in the national spread of the NO+ (“No more”) campaign, a slogan designed to be completed by citizens with their own demands and circulated across Chile through collective use. The exhibition echoes this distributive spirit by offering reprinted flyers and small NO+ pin — objects that demonstrate how the work gained force by being passed hand to hand.Across these works, what emerges most forcefully is that Rosenfeld’s resistance was never simply oppositional, but built on collective methods. Her actions slipped past the state’s mechanisms of control, carving out fissures where dissent could take root, and making visible how disobedience often begins with the smallest breach: the refusal to let a line point only in one direction.Left: CADA, \"1/2 litre leche envelope (Para no morir)\" (1979), empty milk bag with stamp; right: Cecilia Vicuña, \"HAMBRE (HUNGER)\" (1979), pen on paper drawing Photo documentation of CADA, \"Para no morir de hambre en el arte\" art actions (1979)Photo documentation of different iterations of Lotty Rosenfeld, \"Una Milla de Cruces Sobre el Pavimento\" (One mile of crosses on the pavement, 1981–85).Installation view of Lotty Rosenfeld, \"Una herida Americana\" (1982), 35mm slides from original color videotape on 3/4\" cassette, 5 min.Photo documentation of CADA, \"No+ art\" actions (1981–89)Lotty Rosenfeld: Disobedient Spaces continues at Wallach Art Gallery (615 West 129th Street, West Harlem, Manhattan) through March 15.

    "body": "\n            A group of artists, preservationists, and activists is sounding the alarm against Trump’s potential demolition of a prominent federal office building next to the National Mall, and the treasured artworks inside it — including several New Deal-era murals that speak to the value of Social Security in the United States.Alex Lawson, executive director of the advocacy organization Social Security Works, co-authored a petition to save the works with local muralist Absurdly Well. Released earlier this week, the missive demands that the Trump administration cease its plans to sell the Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building, described in the petition as the “Sistine Chapel of New Deal art.”In an interview with Hyperallergic, Lawson called Trump’s proposed transaction “authoritarianism 101.”“Erasing art culture and history is how authoritarians make it seem there’s nothing better than the thin gruel of cruelty they are offering,” Lawson said. “We couldn’t stop them from destroying the East Wing of the White House, but I pledge we’ll stop them from destroying the Wilbur Cohen building.”It would have been unthinkable merely a year ago that any president would willingly erase a visible symbol of America’s national heritage.The facade of the Cohen Federal Building in Washington, DC (photo Sabrina Davis/Social Security Works)But these are unprecedented times. After tearing down the East Wing to build a new ballroom without approvals from a national planning commission or Congress and affixing his name on the Kennedy Center, President Trump is seeking to liquidate four federal buildings by auctioning them to private developers.One of them is the Wilbur Cohen building, a block-long office on Independence Avenue that houses the headquarters of the Social Security Administration and Voice of America’s offices. The Charles Klauder-designed Egyptian Revivalist structure has been a historically designated landmark in Washington, DC, since 1978 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places nearly two decades ago.The building interiors, which feature works by Ben Shahn, Philip Guston, Seymour Fogel, and Ethel and Jenne Magafan, are also landmarked and arguably even more significant. The most famous of them is Shahn’s stark yet emotional fresco-secco “The Meaning of Social Security” (1942), depicting how the federal financial safety net lifted American families out of the poverty they endured during the Great Depression. Shahn once called the fresco, which he painted on dry plaster, “the best work I’ve done.”Main panel of Ben Shahn's \"The Meaning of Social Security\" (photo by Carol Highsmith via Library of Congress)Fogel’s works “Security of the People” (1942) and “Wealth of the Nation” (1942) show Americans raising their families and working in scientific labs and factories to build an equitable society in the 20th century. Preservationist Judy Chesser, head of the nonprofit land use and planning group Committee of 100 on the Federal City, said the works symbolized the importance of the American worker through history and would be “very difficult and expensive to remove.”“The art and architecture of these endangered properties manifest the good that happens when the government puts the American worker first, as it did when these were conceived in the Works Progress Administration,” Chesser said in a statement to Hyperallergic. That hasn’t stopped President Trump from razing historically prominent artworks. In 1979, the Trump Organization executive purchased the Bonwit Teller building on 5th Avenue and 56th Street for $15 million and promised to donate two limestone Art Deco friezes to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Instead, workers destroyed the panels while demolishing the building to make way for Trump Tower. Trump reportedly told the press at the time that the art had no intrinsic value.When the White House published a list of hundreds of federal properties across the country it sought to close down or potentially sell two months into Trump’s tenure, few in Washington took the downsizing seriously until bulldozers began dismantling the East Wing in October. Now Trump’s plan is clear. The General Services Administration (GSA), which owns and operates most of the nation’s federal office buildings, listed the Wilbur Cohen property as an asset for accelerated disposition last year for the purpose of selling it off to a private owner. The building has more than 1 million square feet of rentable office space, but a developer would more likely prefer to tear it down and build their own project, preservationists said.Detail of “Benefits of Social Security” (1941) by Henry Kreis (photo Sabrina Davis/Social Security Works)That revelation sparked fear among activists who have been mobilizing to defend the landmark. Lawson has been reaching out to his email list of 4 million Social Security recipients, whom he said overwhelmingly oppose such a move, while artists and preservationists, including FDR’s grandson Jim Roosevelt, have signed a letter to save the building.The GSA’s move even drew attention from Congress. Maine Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree, co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Arts Caucus, vowed to “fight this reckless plan and to protect our cultural institutions from this inconsiderate and destructive Administration.” “The building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, and its art belong to the American people and represent a unique era when our government recognized the importance of investing in public art and memorializing landmark legislative accomplishments like the Social Security Act,” Pingress said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “Demolition would be a devastating and irreversible loss.”Artist Absurdly Well, who co-authored the recent petition, said the Trump administration was seeking to erase the country’s memory and history as it seeks to dismantle the anti-poverty systems Americans have relied on for generations. “Artists everywhere should be enraged by this. That rage needs to go back into studios, apartments, and then back into the streets. We need art in public space that says: You do not get to erase this narrative,” he said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “This history matters.”\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Washington, DC\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        ",

While the curatorial team can’t be faulted for this, it remained fresh on my mind as I considered the powers we are beholden to in the United States. The exhibition begins unexpectedly with a small selection of landscapes on fire or caught in an impending storm — moments of chaos not typically associated with the famed centenarian artist whose work harkened back to rural, idyllic depictions of the US during an era of rapid modernization. The excitement these flames stirred in me was quickly extinguished by the exhibition’s safe presentation of Grandma Moses's work. Its main accomplishment is its scale, which allows visitors to enjoy an astounding quantity of this seminal artist’s oeuvre. But rather than presenting any novel or nuanced readings of the artist, or even justifying the exhibition’s evocative title, it lays out a thorough biography of the artist that is didactic as opposed to substantial.This lack of discursive rigor is disappointing, given that the exhibition catalog brims with wonderfully researched essays that complicate the scholarship on Moses. While it’s easy — and true — to point to Trump’s executive order “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” as the reason for this risk-averse approach, the discrepancy reveals a deeper issue: the costs of preserving the myths that embody US exceptionalism. Grandma Moses’s trajectory as arguably the most famous artist in the United States is certainly notable; however, her vast, complex body of work warrants more careful aesthetic critique. The seemingly benign narrative presented in the galleries must be deconstructed, as it also embodies detrimental values the United States holds.  Grandma Moses, \"Early Springtime on the Farm\" (1945), oil on high-density fiberboard Anna Mary Robertson Moses was born in 1860 in the farmland of Washington County, New York. She was briefly educated in a one-room schoolhouse and then sent to work full-time for a wealthy couple as a preteen. Through that difficult experience, Moses learned skills in domestic farm labor that she would carry to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley after marrying her husband, Thomas Salmon Moses, as they tried to make a fortune in the Reconstruction-era South. Although they founded a life there, having 10 children, 5 of whom survived to adulthood, Moses and her family eventually moved back to Upstate New York after 18 years in 1905, where they bought a small, successful farm. In 1938, Moses was discovered by Louis Caldor, an art collector who saw her paintings in a drugstore. She gradually entered the limelight, becoming an endearing figure who graced the cover of Time magazine and whose work was reproduced in memorabilia, making her a ubiquitous grandmother figure. While Moses’s age is often pointed out biographically in the show, it is never given credence as an artistic factor, despite its formal importance to her painting. In fact, it was the impetus for her artistic output, as she switched from crafting pictures out of yarn to painting because of rheumatoid arthritis. In her catalog essay, “Age, Race, and Memory,” Erika Doss articulates that the increase in life expectancy in the 20th century marginalized older Americans, leading to false perceptions that they were burdens on their families and society. Doss then frames Moses as the antithesis: a symbol of the strong, self-sufficient American spirit. Grandma Moses, \"White Birches\" (1961), oil on pressed woodMoses’s age manifests in ways that are never acknowledged in the exhibition, though. Made 16 years apart and displayed side-by-side, “Early Springtime on the Farm” (1945) and “White Birches” (1961) evidence the deterioration of the artist’s fine motor skills. The springtime scene, still covered in a blanket of snow, is made up of bold, controlled applications of paint, while the green, vivacious scene surrounding nine birches has a soft, splotchy, expressionistic quality that suggests a loss of technical dexterity. Rather than exploring the reality of old age changing our bodies, the show and catalog reinforce the notion of Moses as a figure who beat time. The artist still experienced the effects of aging, and the omission perpetuates the idea that any bodily flaws are a burden to society — a larger ableist tendency prevalent in the United States.The exclusive presence of White figures in Moses’s scenes on display is another issue that the exhibition skirts. The racial bias is especially evident when considering her depictions of Virginia, where she is known to have hired Black domestic and farm laborers for years. “Calhoun” (1955), for instance, depicts a beautiful brick farmhouse and surrounding fertile farmland happily tended by White workers, betraying the historical reality. The artist herself never publicly acknowledged this disparity, and although the show references the “predominantly light-skinned” subjects, that is the extent of its critical analysis. Several essays in the catalog do tackle the issue of the racial dynamics of land ownership in the South, yet the absence is glaring in the galleries. Grandma Moses, \"Calhoun\" (1955), oil on pressed woodIronically, race is also tied to the weakest part of Moses’s practice: painting figures. Moses’s amorphous people, with crude smiley-face lines as expression, often detract from her skillfully rendered, serene landscapes. The quality of Moses's work as a painter has always been central to the artist’s discourse: “Serious” formalist critics of the 20th century derided her work for perceived fluffiness and its inconsequentiality to Modernism, while populists believed her achievements to be extraordinary. Why can’t both be true? Many of Moses’s paintings are formally spectacular, but aesthetically unpleasant flaws plague others. Take “July Fourth” (1951), which shows a White community parading down a town’s main road, waving flags as a group of kids play baseball under another flag. The mass of figures amplifies how awkward the faces, with their black dots and lines, are. Both this and the nationalism are cloying, lacking the poise of Moses’s more sparse and contemplative scenes. Grandma Moses: A Good Day’s Work feels frozen in time. While the catalog does admirable heavy lifting, it’s a massive disservice to both a public familiar and unfamiliar with her rich history to offer a show with little new. The most unfortunate part of the show is that refusing to complicate her legacy actually flattens it. Instead, more profound truths can be uncovered within her work to debunk harmful mythologies endemic to the US, while still upholding the magnitude of Moses’s achievement as one of the most famous and delightful American artists.Grandma Moses: A Good Day’s Work continues at the Smithsonian American Art Museum (G Street Northwest & 8th Street Northwest, Washington, DC) through July 12.

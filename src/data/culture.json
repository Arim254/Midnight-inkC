    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tDecember 24th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOne can hard­ly con­sid­er the Christ­mas sea­son for long, at least in the Eng­lish-speak­ing world, with­out the work of Charles Dick­ens com­ing to mind. That owes for the most part, of course, to A Christ­mas Car­ol, the novel­la that revived the pub­lic cul­ture of a hol­i­day that had been falling into desue­tude by the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry. What­ev­er its lit­er­ary short­com­ings, the book offers a host of mem­o­rable images, not least culi­nary ones: Mrs. Cratchit’s pud­ding, for instance, which Dick­ens likens to “a speck­led can­non-ball, so hard and firm, blaz­ing in half or half-a-quar­tern of ignit­ed brandy, and bedight with Christ­mas hol­ly stuck into the top.”\n\n\n\t\n\nIn the Tast­ing His­to­ry video at the top of the post, host Max Miller teach­es you how to make just such a hol­i­day pud­ding — and indeed a fig­gy one, a con­fec­tion whose name we all rec­og­nize from no less a stan­dard car­ol than “We Wish You a Mer­ry Christ­mas,” even if we don’t know that pud­ding, in the Vic­to­ri­an sense, refers to a kind of cake.\nThe fig­gy pud­ding Miller makes from an orig­i­nal 1845 recipe looks, and seems to taste, more like an alco­hol-soaked ver­sion of the fruit­cakes many of us still receive come Christ­mas­time. Despite its rep­u­ta­tion for lead­en unde­sir­abil­i­ty, rein­forced by decade after decade of John­ny Car­son gags, the fruit­cake has a rich his­to­ry, which Miller reveals in the video just above, and culi­nary strengths beyond its extreme shelf life.\n\n\n\t\n\nThis playlist of 20 Christ­mas-themed videos offers many more such delights: Turk­ish delight, for instance, as well as Vic­to­ri­an sug­ar plums, medieval gin­ger­bread, and his­tor­i­cal ver­sions of such still-com­mon com­forts and joys as eggnog and pump­kin pie. And if you’ve ever won­dered to what was­sail — as a noun or a verb — actu­al­ly refers, have a look at the video above, in which Miller explains it all while mak­ing a pot of the stuff, which turns out to be a kind of apple­sauce-enriched ale. Was­sail, too, is a favorite Dick­ens ref­er­ence, and not just in A Christ­mas Car­ol. His first nov­el The Pick­wick Papers includes a Christ­mas feast with “a mighty bowl of was­sail, some­thing small­er than an ordi­nary wash-house cop­per, in which the hot apples were hiss­ing and bub­bling with a rich look, and a jol­ly sound, that were per­fect­ly irre­sistible”: the kind of image that, near­ly two cen­turies lat­er, still makes read­ers want to go a‑wassailing.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nEudo­ra Welty’s Hand­writ­ten Eggnog Recipe, and Charles Dick­ens’ Recipe for Hol­i­day Punch\nTry George Orwell’s Recipe for Christ­mas Pud­ding, from His Essay “British Cook­ery” (1945)\nCharles Min­gus’ “Top Secret” Eggnog Recipe Con­tains “Enough Alco­hol to Put Down an Ele­phant”\nHow Eat­ing Ken­tucky Fried Chick­en Became a Christ­mas Tra­di­tion in Japan\nTast­ing His­to­ry: A Hit YouTube Series Shows How to Cook the Foods of Ancient Greece & Rome, Medieval Europe, and Oth­er Places & Peri­ods\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tDecember 25th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nIt will no doubt come as a relief to many read­ers that San­ta Claus appears to have been a Union sup­port­er. We know this because he appears dis­trib­ut­ing gifts to sol­diers from that side of the Mason-Dixon in one of his ear­li­est depic­tions. That illus­tra­tion, “San­ta Claus in Camp” (above), first appeared in the Harper’s Week­ly Christ­mas issue of 1862, when the Amer­i­can Civ­il War was still tear­ing its way through the coun­try. Its artist, a Bavar­i­an immi­grant named Thomas Nast, is now remem­bered for hav­ing first drawn the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty as a don­key and the Repub­li­can Par­ty as an ele­phant, but he also did more than any­one else to cre­ate the image of San­ta Claus rec­og­nized around the world today: more than Nor­man Rock­well, and more, even, than the Coca-Cola Com­pa­ny.\n\nSan­ta Claus is an Angli­ciza­tion of Sin­terk­laas, a Dutch name for Saint Nicholas, who lived and died in what’s now Turkey in the third and fourth cen­turies, and who’s been remem­bered since for his kind­ness to chil­dren. Few of us would rec­og­nize him in his por­trait from 1294 that is includ­ed in the Pub­lic Domain Review’s pic­to­r­i­al his­to­ry of San­ta Claus, but with the pass­ing of the cen­turies, his images became mixed with those of oth­er fly­ing, win­ter-asso­ci­at­ed char­ac­ters from Ger­man­ic and Norse myth. In 1822, Clement Moore per­formed a defin­ing act of rhyming syn­the­sis with his poem “A Vis­it from St. Nicholas” (often called “ ‘Twas the Night Before Christ­mas”): in its vers­es we find the bun­dle of toys, the rosy cheeks, the white beard, the bel­ly shak­ing like a bowl full of jel­ly.\n\nNast clear­ly under­stood not just the appeal of Moore’s descrip­tion, but also the char­ac­ter’s pro­pa­gan­da val­ue. His very first ren­di­tions of San­ta Claus appear in the upper cor­ners of an 1862 Harper’s Week­ly illus­tra­tion of a pray­ing wife and her Yan­kee sol­dier hus­band. Near­ly two decades lat­er, Nast drew the car­toon “Mer­ry Old San­ta Claus” (imme­di­ate­ly above), whose cen­tral fig­ure remains imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able to us today, even as its moti­vat­ing polit­i­cal cause of high­er wages for the mil­i­tary has become obscure. In the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, the icon­ic Father Christ­mas would be enlist­ed again to lend pub­lic sup­port to U.S. efforts in World War I and II, in the very decades when Rock­well was fur­ther refin­ing and cement­ing his image in pop­u­lar cul­ture. The once-unlike­ly result was an Amer­i­can San­ta Claus: “the sym­bol of our empire,” in the words of The New York­er’s Adam Gop­nik, “as much as Apol­lo was of the Hel­lenic one.”\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch San­ta Claus, the Ear­li­est Movie About San­ta in Exis­tence (1898)\nDid San­ta Claus & His Rein­deers Begin with a Mush­room Trip?: Dis­cov­er the Psy­che­del­ic, Shaman­is­tic Side of Christ­mas\nHear “Twas The Night Before Christ­mas” Read by Stephen Fry & John Cleese\nJ.

    "body": "\n    \n                Daily Newsletter\n                From Christo's billowing flags to forgotten oral histories, this year reminded me why art matters: it gives voice, refuses erasure, and makes something beautiful from the wreckage.\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Film still of Patty Chang, \"Melons (at a loss)\" (1998), on view in Monstrous Beauty (2025) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (image courtesy the artist)\n    \n        \n            This Christmas, I’m grateful — it’s a sentimental time of year, OK? I’m about to hit my two-year mark as an associate editor here at Hyperallergic, where my bread and butter is New York City: a weekly newsletter (my baby), and exhibition reviews — dispatches from the center of the art world (I may be biased). And it’s certainly been an eventful year, from museum reopenings to blockbuster exhibitions to a brand-new mayor, who brought a groundswell of hope and a bounty of memes. To me, though, it's been a year of deepening my relationship to the city — not getting caught up in that never-ending tide that is New York, but finding the stillness beneath the current.“Anchoring” to me means grounding myself in the true, the felt, the tangible. The art world prizes in-person communion — the irreplaceable experience of seeing a work in person — yet increasingly trades in digital surrogates: press releases, Instagram posts, installation views. Coupled with the rise of AI, we’re in danger of losing touch with what's embodied, what's real. The city’s the exact kind of place that interrupts that — you're scrolling peacefully on your phone on the train platform, for instance, and then someone's elbow is in your ribs. The real — if buried and bygone — New York surfaced more pleasantly for me when I got to work with Lower East Side stalwart Arthur Nersesian, whose book The Fuck-Up (1997), a hilarious jaunt through the degenerate ’90s, was one of my favorites of the year. His review of an oral history of the Pyramid Club, now known as Nightclub 101, is steeped in memory and drawn from a deep wellspring of lived history. Meanwhile, I never thought I'd get my heart broken at The Shed, but the Christo show there undid me for similar reasons — I was suddenly seven years old again, looking upon the billowing neon-orange flags reflected in the snow in Central Park.But as far as deepening my relationship with our community goes, meeting so many of you at our Halloween party at Francis Kite Club — particularly in costume — was a highlight of the year. So was our coverage of MFA thesis shows — which most art publications completely ignore, even though students are integral to our community, and its future. But just as important as looking forward is remembering: It is my deepest honor to write the weekly In Memoriam column, in which we memorialize those we lost. Working with our writers is by far the best part of a great gig. I look forward to corresponding with Taliesin Thomas for the Upstate guide every month — both her presence and her emails are just as ebullient as her writing, and it’s infectious enough to melt even my cynical heart. Working with the colossus that is John Yau has sharpened the way that I look at painting and abstraction, and editing the brilliant, broad-minded, and astonishingly erudite Ed Simon on the radical egalitarianism of nativity scenes, the visual history of No Kings, the tackiness and historical backing of Trump’s aesthetic, and so much else has informed my own writing. Our writers enrich my understanding of the world even from afar: Claudia Ross on the way history reverberates surprisingly, painfully, and generatively into the present in her review of the Monuments exhibition in Los Angeles. Noah Angell on the artist who’s been giving voice to the musical instruments languishing in museum storage, dying to be heard. Cristiana Grigore’s deeply personal and moving piece on the Roma artists all of us should know. Anne Anlin Cheng on a show spanning half a millennium of chinoiserie that transforms objectification into something stranger, more insurgent, almost human. And Jad Salfiti on the little Berlin institute that dares to speak up in a country where Palestinian solidarity is nearly verboten. This is what art can do: give voice, refuse erasure, make something beautiful from the wreckage. That’s our work here, too. Thank you for reading, for subscribing, for being part of our community. If you’re not already, please consider supporting our work as a paying Hyperallergic Member — it’d make a great very-last-minute gift, if you’re a procrastinator like me. Happy holidays — and here’s to another year! —Lisa Yin Zhang, associate editorThe options are endless.

(all screenshots Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic via r/WhatIsMyCookieCutter)\n    \n        \n            'Tis the season of over-the-top cookie decorating, and while shaped cookie cutters are normally sold in themed sets, many of them go astray and lose their context entirely. In a Reddit community devoted to figuring out what those unidentified cookie cutters might depict, many of its members are finding that the obscure outlines are the perfect tool to spark their imagination. The subreddit, r/WhatIsMyCookieCutter, carved out its own community during the holiday season in 2022 after years of Reddit users flocking the r/baking forum to get help in figuring out what their rogue cookie cutters are supposed to be. The space started out as a fun guessing game to help solve years-long household mysteries born of many a Christmas past, but it turns out it's much more fun for people to propose the most absurd, niche, and outlandish possibilities, complete with accompanying digital drawings that fit those odd shapes. Alligator flying out of an ice hole? Your guess is as good as mine ...A shape as innocuous as the one pictured above yields myriad interpretations — a testament to the diversity of the human experience. Actually, these guesses are all better than mine. As it turns out, the cookie cutter was identified as the shape of Finland, but never let reality get in the way of your imagination.The community has exploded over the last three years, with over 350,000 weekly visitors. It's also one of the more wholesome spaces on the website. We're all thinking it ... This one was never solved, but the user insisted on no NSFW ideas, so feast thine eyes on this array of family-friendly interpretations.If you give a Redditor a cookie cutter ... Voila!Some of the cookie cutter shapes become blindingly obvious once they're correctly identified, but one must ask why they exist in the first place. For example, this one illustrating a KitchenAid standing mixer: I never would have guessed it, but now I can't unsee it. But those ones only serve to fan the flames of web-based creativity ...All worthy contenders!Many tropes have come about in the community — cats in bizarre poses, weed paraphernalia, Halloween ghosts, the Saddam Hussein hiding place meme, and there's even one user who has become a meme in the subreddit because he interprets every shape as a rose. He's since been dubbed “rose guy,” and many users pay homage to him through their own posts. A top post from the 2025 holiday seasonChoose your fighter, cartoon mammal edition. Sometimes, however, the cookie cutter shape is exactly what it is, and nothing else.There really is something for everyone out there. What are the odds? All of that is to say that the r/WhatIsMyCookieCutter community serves to remind us that there are cathedrals everywhere for those with eyes to see. It's a place to come together, have a laugh, and, for many who may not be art-aligned, a space to exercise the brain's creative side once again. Some users have said that this subreddit has been more helpful for inspiring daily drawing than other communities specifically for art.Or perhaps, the whole endeavor shows us that maybe we shouldn't have done away with the Rorschach test after all. Happy holidays everyone, and may your iced cookies be as unique and creative as each of us. \n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

I think it’s weird that the Tooth Fairy takes teeth, but that’s not my job either.So your job is to judge people, but not to judge people for judging people.You’re making it sound like I approve of Krampus’s methods. I don’t. Just because you share a holiday with someone doesn’t mean you agree with them on everything. I love kids.Sandy Ernest Allen confronts their Harry Potter fandom as a trans person for Literary Hub (spoiler — it involves a bonfire):In reality, the number one lesson of the Harry Potter series was, ironically: We’re all humans deserving of equal rights, even the “weirdest” amongst us, even those most discarded by our families and/or by society, even those who’ve been caught up in histories we ourselves don’t yet understand. We’re all people deserving of love and respect and dignity. [...]What to do about this situation, I myself had not been sure. I was an adult and not especially “into” the series (as some adults are). I’d still comfort-binge the movies if they were marathoning on a hotel TV perhaps and I felt the right sort of depressed. But now I’d walk into my office and see her books there on my shelf—and feel sick about the whole situation.There will soon be an artist living in New York City's Gracie Mansion — Rama Duwaji, wife of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, sat for a profile and photoshoot with The Cut, and the internet is atwitter:\n\nThe best latte art in all of antiquity:\ni bet she was the best barista at the carthaginian coffee shop pic.twitter.com/ptW6bu0ll8— romanistani state-affiliated media (@djangofetts) December 17, 2025 \nIf you've been in the art world for any length of time, you know about the near-cultish obsession with Julia Cameron's 1992 self-help book The Artist's Way:\n\nThe plot twist I've been waiting for in every Hallmark Christmas movie:\n\nFinding the holiday spirit in the most unexpected of places — that's what it's all about.

David Lynch, a filmmaker so revolutionary that his style became a new standard. Frank Gehry, the sculptor of skylines. Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, the multi-hyphenate force of Indigenous aesthetics. Alonzo Davis, who was one of the first Black gallerists in this country and didn't stop there. Koyo Kouoh, who would have been the first African woman to direct the Venice Biennale. And so many more.Below are 20 luminaries we've lost this year, ordered by when they passed. Our ongoing weekly column In Memoriam offers a fuller picture of those who've gone and the marks they left. As we enter the new year, we carry them with us. — Lisa Yin Zhang, associate editorDavid Lynch (b. 1946)Filmmaker who conjured the uncannyDavid Lynch (photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)The multi-hyphenate film director and artist's work was so influential that it became integral to the tropes and aesthetics of cinematic horror, surrealism, and melodrama. He is known for classics both cult and traditional, from Blue Velvet (1986) to Mulholland Drive (2001), and many more.Read the obituaryJo Baer (b. 1929)Painter of \"radical figuration\"Jo Baer in 2020 (© Yaël Temminck)She initially rose to prominence during the burgeoning male-dominated Minimalism movement of the 1960s and '70s before rejecting the art form in favor of more experimental and figurative compositions. A sharp writer, she penned letters to editors, statements, and articles that at times ostracized her from her peers for her unswerving defense of painting.Read the obituaryJaune Quick-to-See Smith (b. 1940)Indigenous visual artist, curator, and activistJaune Quick-to-See Smith (photo by Grace Roselli, courtesy the Estate of Jaune Quick-to-See Smith and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York)Her prolific arts practice merged piercing humor and profound sociopolitical commentary with poetic depictions of Native American life. Her five-decade oeuvre spans painting, collage, drawing, print, and sculpture, exemplifying her lifelong refusal to be defined by any singular narrative.Read the obituaryAlonzo Davis (b. 1942)Artist and one of the first Black gallerists in the USA black-and-white portrait of Alonzo Davis (image courtesy Alonzo Davis Studios; all photos courtesy Parrasch Heijnen gallery)He and his brother David co-founded Brockman Gallery, the first major Black-owned contemporary gallery in Los Angeles, in 1967. Over a six-decade career, he continued to champion Black American art and culture, and created abstract mixed-media paintings, wall pieces, and murals.Read the obituaryMel Bochner (b. 1940)Pioneering conceptual artistMel Bochner at Villa Sciarra, Rome, 1985 (photo by Lizbeth Marano, courtesy Bochner Studio and Peter Freeman, Inc., New York/Paris)He treated language as a medium rather than a tool, upending contemporary art in the process. His vibrant thesaurus paintings and experimental installations explored the relationship between language, mathematics, and perception while challenging traditional canvas boundaries.Read the obituaryDorgham Qreiqea (b. 1997)Palestinian muralist and oil painterA photo from 2022 of Palestinian artist Dorgham Qreiqea with one of his figurative paintings (photo courtesy Dorgham Qreiqea's Facebook profile)A skilled muralist, oil painter, and portrait artist, he exhibited in Gaza's now-destroyed arts spaces, including Shababeek for Contemporary Art. Dedicated to community empowerment, he worked on a mask painting project during the COVID-19 pandemic and served as coordinator for an art-related youth group. On March 18, he was killed by an Israeli airstrike on Gaza.Read the obituaryNona Faustine (b. 1977)Photographer who confronted centuries of violenceNona Faustine (photo by Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images)Grounded in extensive research, Faustine’s photography often explored complex concepts of legacy, representation, trauma, and identity as they related to racial and gender stereotypes. She was best known for her self-portrait series White Shoes (2012–21), in which she posed nude or partially clothed in symbolic white heels at various former slave auction sites across New York.Read the obituaryMax Kozloff (b. 1933)Intrepid art critic and photographerMax Kozloff in an undated photo (photo courtesy Joyce Kozloff)A leading voice in 20th-century art criticism, Kozloff paved the way for political examinations of postwar art in his canonical essay “American Painting During the Cold War” (1973). He authored more than a dozen books, and was an editor and critic at various magazines.Read the obituaryDara Birnbaum (b. 1946)Video art’s “Wonder Woman”Dara Birnbaum in her solo show at Osservatorio Fondazione Prada in Milan, 2023 (photo by Francesca D’Amico, courtesy Marian Goodman Gallery)Over a half-century career, she spliced, resequenced, and repeated excerpts from sources as diverse as game show quizzes, sports programming, soap operas, and YouTube videos to explore and manipulate how information is disseminated, transformed, and assimilated. Read the obituaryMatthew Courtney (b. 1959)Downtown NYC artist who platformed othersCourtney making a cardboard sign at his Soho sidewalk gallery Steps to Nowhere (photo by and courtesy Fly Orr)A founding member of the grassroots Lower East Side arts nonprofit ABC No Rio, he hosted its celebrated Wide Open Cabaret series from the mid-1980s through early ’90s. He was a longtime fixture of Soho's street community, as seen in his makeshift, sidewalk-based Steps to Nowhere Gallery.Read the obituaryKoyo Kouoh (b. 1967)Cameroonian curator tapped for 61st Venice BiennaleA 2023 portrait of Koyo Kouoh at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (MOCAA) in Cape Town (photo by Marco Longari/AFP, courtesy the museum)Appointed as the next Venice Biennale's artistic director in December, Kouoh would have been the first African woman to oversee the international exhibition. She also served as the executive director and chief curator of Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (MOCAA).Read the obituaryDaniel Lelong (b. 1933)Co-founder of Galerie LelongDaniel Lelong in 2009 at Galerie Lelong in Paris (photo courtesy Galerie Lelong)He collaborated with some of the 20th century’s most well-known artists, including Joan Miró and Francis Bacon, and co-founded his namesake galleries in Paris and New York. He also made scholarly contributions to the careers of these artists, publishing a monograph of Calder’s work in 1971 and some of Miró's catalogue raisonnés. Read the obituaryJoel Shapiro (b. 1941)Sculptor of emotive figuresJoel Shapiro in 2024 (photo by Kyle Knodell, courtesy Pace Gallery)He was known for monumental bronze figures that transcended Minimalism with emotive, quasi-abstract forms resembling stick figures in motion. His work includes more than 30 public commissions and pieces in major collections worldwide.Read the obituary Raymond Saunders (b. 1934)Portrait of American artist Raymond Saunders (1970s) (photo by Anthony Barboza/Getty Images)He was a cult-like figure in the Bay Area art community. On idiosyncratic blackboard surfaces, he integrated chalk notation and assemblage to plumb the depths of lived experience and racial identity.Read the obituaryAgnes Gund (b. 1938)Champion of arts and equityAgnes Gund (photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images)A major collector and trustee at institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, she was also a staunch social justice advocate who fought for a more compassionate world. She founded the arts education nonprofit Studio in a School and launched the Art for Justice Fund to help end mass incarceration.Read the obituary Frank Wimberley (b. 1926)Endlessly experimental abstract expressionist Frank Wimberley in an undated photo (photo courtesy Berry Campbell Gallery)He was influenced by and an integral part of abstract expressionism and the Black Arts Movement, as well as a pillar of Long Island artist communities. “He explained the visions of artworks he still dreamt of making, sometimes waking him up in the night, enlivened with creative energy,” critic Jasmine Weber writes. “Into his final year, Frank Wimberley was still ripping, tearing, pasting, and painting paper to create new worlds.”Read the obituary Carla Stellweg (b. 1942)Visionary of Latin American ArtCarla Stellweg in Cuernavaca in August 2024 (photo by and courtesy Tessa Morefield)The fearless curator and writer shifted the very ground of Mexican contemporary art at a critical juncture for the country’s history and identity. From her work at Mexico's Museo de Arte Moderno in the 1970s to founding galleries in New York, she challenged institutional hierarchies throughout her career.Read the obituaryJackie Ferrara (b. 1929)Sculptor who contained chaos in geometric formsJackie Ferrara in New York on February 13, 2025 (photo by Jason Schmidt, courtesy the Jackie Ferrara Foundation)A fixture of New York’s downtown art scene, she discovered her visual language of graceful wooden structures and architectural environments while renovating her Soho loft. She saw her art as puzzles to be solved, and her public sculptures dot midwestern towns. \"Ferrara might have sought to contain the chaos of her life in precise, geometric forms,\" Zoë Lescaze writes, \"but their subtle unpredictability reflects her own.\"Read the obituary Alison Knowles (b. 1933)The first woman of FluxusAlison Knowles at home in New York in 2014 (photo by and courtesy Jason Bergman for Lucky Peach)A powerhouse of postwar experimental art and a co-founder of the Fluxus movement, she exploded the boundaries of every form she inhabited, including sculpture, process-based art, computer art, and more. She will be remembered for her radical interventions in form, her emphasis on the poetry in the physical world, and her insistence on art as a lived form.  Read the obituaryFrank Gehry (b. 1929)Sculptor of buildingsFrank Gehry on July 7, 2021 in Arles, France (photo by Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images)He made iconic postmodernist designs for museums, libraries, and concert halls, with the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao being his most instantly recognizable work. He was a \"true original,\" Mary Anne Gilmartin, an architect who worked with Gehry, told Hyperallergic. \"An artist, an architect, and a fearless visionary who changed the way we experience cities.\"Read the obituary\n                  \n                      \n                        In Memoriam\n                      \n                      \n                        Obituaries\n                      \n                      \n                        Community\n                      \n                      \n                        Best of 2025\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

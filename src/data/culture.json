    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Economics |   \tFebruary 1st, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs men­tioned here last week, Scott Gal­loway argued that Amer­i­cans have one way to reverse the vio­lent over­reach of the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment: launch a one-month eco­nom­ic strike aimed at major tech and AI com­pa­nies, with the goal of reduc­ing Amer­i­ca’s GDP and mak­ing the mar­kets wob­ble. When the mar­kets gyrat­ed after “Lib­er­a­tion Day,” Pres­i­dent Trump imme­di­ate­ly rolled back many tar­iffs. Now, if Amer­i­cans can flex their eco­nom­ic mus­cles in Feb­ru­ary, Gal­loway wagers the admin­is­tra­tion will rethink whether it wants to keep arrest­ing jour­nal­ists and let­ting masked ICE agents shoot civil­ians in the streets—with impuni­ty.\nToday, Gal­loway has launched a new web­site, Resist and Unsub­scribe, that pro­vides an action plan for a month­long strike. In the “Ground Zero” sec­tion of the site, Gal­loway lists sub­scrip­tion ser­vices from America’s largest tech­nol­o­gy companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple, Net­flix, Ope­nAI, and Microsoft—and pro­vides links that let users unsub­scribe quick­ly. He also sug­gests hold­ing off on buy­ing new hard­ware and prod­ucts from these com­pa­nies (e.g. iPhones). If you use Feb­ru­ary to review your sub­scrip­tions and find ones to cut, you’ll clean up your per­son­al finances. You’ll also get the atten­tion of the major tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies that account for one-third of the S&P 500. When the tech CEOs get “yip­py,” so too will Trump.\nIn the “Blast Zone” sec­tion of Resist and Unsub­scribe, Gal­loway lists consumer‑facing com­pa­nies he has “iden­ti­fied as active enablers of ICE,” nam­ing AT&T, Com­cast, Lowe’s, Mar­riott, and Spo­ti­fy among oth­ers. He explains how these com­pa­nies sup­port ICE and rec­om­mends spe­cif­ic ser­vices you can can­cel or avoid. Scroll down the page to see these sug­ges­tions.\nVis­it Resist and Unsub­scribe, find some ser­vices to can­cel (it’s not a large sac­ri­fice), and spread the word. You can also find more infor­ma­tion about the Resist and Unsub­scribe move­ment on Gal­loway’s blog, “No Mercy/No Mal­ice.”\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nScott Gal­loway Explains How YOU Can Stop Gov­ern­ment Over­reach Using the Pow­er of Your Purse\nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Life, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen the his­to­ry books are writ­ten, we’ll remem­ber the politi­cians, law firms, and CEOs who quick­ly bent the knee to Don­ald Trump. We’ll also remem­ber the scant few Amer­i­can fig­ures who refused to back down. Bruce Spring­steen will be high on that short list.\nTour­ing in Europe last sum­mer, Spring­steen warned his audi­ence: “The Amer­i­ca that I love, the Amer­i­ca I have writ­ten about, that has been a bea­con of hope and lib­er­ty for 250 years, is cur­rent­ly in the hands of a cor­rupt, incom­pe­tent and trea­so­nous admin­is­tra­tion.” Those words seem par­tic­u­lar­ly pre­scient giv­en the chaos and vio­lence now unfold­ing in Min­neso­ta.\nFol­low­ing the shoot­ings of Renee Good and Alex Pret­ti, Spring­steen made his voice heard again—this time through music. Last week, he released the protest song “Streets of Min­neapo­lis” and soon after­ward trav­eled to Min­neso­ta to per­form the song live at a ben­e­fit con­cert arranged by Tom Morel­lo. Speak­ing to the crowd, Spring­steen said, “I wrote Streets of Min­neapo­lis and record­ed it the next day.” When he won­dered if the song sound­ed too ‘soap­boxy,’ he turned to Morel­lo, and the Rage Against the Machine gui­tarist replied, “Bruce, nuance is won­der­ful, but some­times you need to kick them in the teeth.” We’ll say amen to that.\nAfter “Streets of Min­neapo­lis,” Spring­steen and Morel­lo per­formed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” Watch it above. The start of the show began with “Killing In The Name Of.” Catch it below.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\nScott Gal­loway Unveils “Resist and Unsub­scribe,” an Action Plan for Con­sumers to Push Back Against Gov­ern­ment Over­reach\nTom Morel­lo Responds to Angry Fans Who Sud­den­ly Real­ize That Rage Against the Machine’s Music Is Polit­i­cal: “What Music of Mine DIDN’T Con­tain Polit­i­cal BS?”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough his movies may have ben­e­fit­ed great­ly from for­eign audi­ences and back­ers, David Lynch was one of the most thor­ough­ly Amer­i­can of all film­mak­ers. “Born Mis­soula, MT,” declared his Twit­ter bio, yet one nev­er real­ly asso­ciates him with a par­tic­u­lar place in the Unit­ed States (at least no extant one). From Mon­tana, the Lynch fam­i­ly moved to Ida­ho, then Wash­ing­ton, then North Car­oli­na, then Vir­ginia. The tim­ing of that last stint proved cul­tur­al­ly for­tu­itous indeed: liv­ing in the city of Alexan­dria, the eigh­teen-year-old Lynch was close enough to the nation’s cap­i­tal to attend the very first con­cert the Bea­t­les played in North Amer­i­ca, at the Wash­ing­ton Col­i­se­um on Feb­ru­ary 11, 1964.\n“I was into rock and roll music, main­ly Elvis Pres­ley.” Lynch recalls this unsur­pris­ing fact in the clip above (which would have been among the last inter­views he gave before his death a year ago) from Bea­t­les ’64, the Mar­tin Scors­ese-pro­duced doc­u­men­tary on the Fab Four’s first U.S. tour.\n“I didn’t have any idea how big this event was. And it was in a gigan­tic place where they had box­ing match­es. The Bea­t­les were in the box­ing ring. It was so loud, you can’t believe. Girls shud­der­ing, cry­ing, scream­ing their heart out. It was phe­nom­e­nal.” That deaf­en­ing crowd noise fig­ures into most every account of the group’s Beat­le­ma­nia-era shows — and played a deci­sive role in their per­ma­nent retreat into the stu­dio a cou­ple of years lat­er.\nLynch sure­ly would have under­stood the desire for artis­tic explo­ration and con­trol that drove the Bea­t­les’ con­cen­tra­tion on mak­ing records. Even the sen­si­bil­i­ties of his work and theirs had some­thing in com­mon, exhibit­ing as they both did the unlike­ly com­bi­na­tion of pop­u­lar­i­ty and exper­i­men­ta­tion.  Some­how, David Lynch’s films and the Bea­t­les’ albums could ven­ture into bewil­der­ing obscu­ri­ty and sen­ti­men­tal kitsch with­out los­ing coher­ence or crit­i­cal respect. And dare one imag­ine that the expe­ri­ence of wit­ness­ing the Amer­i­can debut of what would become the most influ­en­tial rock band of all time has giv­en Lynch his appre­ci­a­tion — evi­dent in his movies, but also his own record­ings — for the pow­er of music, which he calls “one of the most fan­tas­tic things”? Even if not, it must have been, well… sur­re­al.\n\n\n\t\n\nvia Wel­come to Twin Peaks\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nAnge­lo Badala­men­ti Reveals How He and David Lynch Com­posed the Twin Peaks’ “Love Theme”\nWhen the Bea­t­les Refused to Play Before Seg­re­gat­ed Audi­ences on Their First U.S. Tour (1964)\nDavid Lynch Directs a New Music Video for Dono­van\nWatch the Bea­t­les Per­form Their Famous Rooftop Con­cert: It Hap­pened 50 Years Ago Today (Jan­u­ary 30, 1969)\nDavid Lynch Talks Med­i­ta­tion with Paul McCart­ney\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDecades before the advent of photography, when European scientists and explorers were undertaking global expeditions and collecting flora and fauna from around the world, art and science converged in fields of medicine, anthropology, and natural history. During the Enlightenment, artists like Elizabeth Blackwell, John Gould, and Elizabeth Gould—among many, many others—documented botanicals, avians, insects, marine species, and more, many of which were published in hefty volumes and archived in museum collections.\nSarah Stone (1759-1844) was a British illustrator and the daughter of a fan painter, whose rich depictions of birds and artifacts highlight a singular talent during an era when women weren’t even permitted to be members of London’s prestigious Royal Academy. Nevertheless, she was invited to exhibit four drawings as an “Honorary Exhibitor” when she was 21.\nGoldfinch (Carduelis carduelis)\nIn the 1770s, British businessman and collector Sir Ashton Lever commissioned Stone to paint items in his museum chock-full of natural and ethnographic objects he called the Holophusikon, also known as the Lever Museum. Stone painted objects at Lever’s Holophusikon well into the 1780s, creating a visual chronicle of objects and fauna acquired from all over the world.\nAristocratic private museums were a phenomenon of the Enlightenment, when Britain enjoyed wealth, prestige, and influence, much of which was derived from other parts of the empire and the transatlantic slave trade. Many of today’s institutions, such as the British Museum, began with individuals’ private collections.\nNearly two dozen of the artist’s paintings are currently on view in Sarah Stone’s Unseen World: A Rare Collection of 18th Century Ornithological Watercolours as part of the Master Drawings New York art fair. Surveying a wide range of incredible birds, from the Bornean peacock pheasant to the distinctive orange-and-black rufous treepie.\nThe exhibition shares its title with a book co-authored by Errol Fuller and art dealer Craig Finch of Finch & Co., which presents the paintings this month. “Like many women painters of her time, Stone produced exquisite watercolour landscapes,” says a statement. “However, she was exceptional in her commercial success, with her paintings sought after by connoisseurs and collectors. In an era when women’s contributions were often overlooked, Stone defied the norm and stood out as a prominent figure.” \nSarah Stone’s Unseen World continues at Peter Harrington Rare Books in Manhattan through February 7.\nBarn Owl (Tyto alba)\nUnidentified Pheasant\nBornean Peacock Pheasant (Polyplecton schleirmacheri)\nDemoiselle Crane (Anthopoides virgo)\nRufous Treepie (Dendrocitta vagabunda)\nUnidentified Parakeets\nGuianan Cock of the Rock (Rupicola rupicola)\n\t\n\t\n\t",

And how is solidarity practiced on the day after?Two stories in today's newsletter prompt readers to ask difficult questions. The first is an in-depth report about tensions between art galleries and street vendors in a Manhattan art hub. The other is artist Damien Davis's opinion piece about the art world's performative allyship.

(photo Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)Tribeca Galleries Discuss Reporting Street Vendors, Drawing CriticismA group of galleries in Tribeca met in January to discuss “issues of safety and accessibility” related to street vendor presence on and near Broadway, raising concerns among activists who say these sellers — many of them immigrants — are already under threat from local and federal officials. Staff Writer Isa Farfan spoke with street vendor advocates and local galleries for this deeply reported story, which illuminates the need for more education and information when it comes to the most vulnerable members of our community.After the Strike, Will Art Galleries Be Allies?Remember the black squares of 2020, shared on social media as a gesture of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement? Recent posts from arts organizations loudly announcing their participation in Friday's anti-ICE strike reminded Damien Davis of these and other often “frictionless” acts of allyship.

    "body": "\n\tThe latest batch of documents released by the Department of Justice as part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act includes references to two leading art collectors, Steve Tisch and Jean Pigozzi. The DOJ’s library of documents have been added to over the past several days, with the latest update occurring on Saturday, January 31.\n\n\tThe documents, primarily in the form of emails sent around 2013, appear to show convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein connecting Tisch, a film producer and co-owner of the New York Giants, with multiple women. The news was first reported on by the Athletic.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tIn one email chain, from April 2013, which has the subject line “Ukrainian Girl,” Tisch asks Epstein if he knows any information about his “assistant’s friend,” who he recently had lunch with. Epstein replied that he “will get all the info,” with Tisch later saying “pro or civilian?” Epstein replies at one point, “civilian, but Russian, and rarely tells the full truth, but fun.”\n\n\tIn a different set of emails, from May 1, 2013, Tisch and Epstein correspond about meeting up that evening. At one point, Tisch writes, “Can I expect ‘trouble’?” Epstein replies, “I can invite the russian [redacted] to meet if you like?” Tisch writes back, “Is she fun?” Later in the chain, Epstein writes, “she is free after 1030 she said, you can meet her, you can come over first.”\n\n\tIn an email chain from May 15–16, 2013, Tisch asks a woman whose name has been redacted if she would be interested in meeting in Boston. Tisch doesn’t receive a reply and forwards the correspondence to Epstein, who replies, “she is traveling. not sure when she returns to florida. she is a micro biology major and is still in university, so i doubt that she could travel during the week, but we’ll see. you should also make it clear that you will orgaznie her ticket.” Tisch later writes back, “Never heard back from her / Oh well…”\n\n\tIn a 2017 email chain, Tisch writes to Epstein, asking how he is and that he hopes Epstein is “having a great Summer.” Epstein replied, “Come visit.” Other documents point to Tisch inviting Epstein to Giants games as well as other meetings over meals.\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement sent to the Athletic about his affiliations with Epstein, Tisch said, “We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.”\n\n\tTisch is also a major collector of contemporary art, having appeared on ARTnews’s Top 200 Collectors list from 2016 to 2024. A 2016 New York Times article revealed that he had created a 4,5000-square-foot private museum to host his collection in the backyard of his Los Angeles home. Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where Tisch is a trustee, curated the initial hang. In 2011, he also donated funds to help LACMA acquire Christian Marclay’s 24-hour video work The Clock (2010).\n\n\tPigozzi’s connections to Epstein are currently circulating online via a 2009 email between Epstein and publicist Peggy Siegal, in which Siegal writes, “Just left Ghislaine’s townhouse…after party for film.  Bill Clinton and Jeff Bezos were there…Jean Pigozzi, director Mira Nair…etc.”\n\n\tThe correspondence, also made in 2013, between Epstein and Pigozzi ranges from emails in which Pigozzi asks if Epstein is planning to visit the south of France that summer to emails where the discuss the appearance of different women. In the latter email chain, Pigozzi wrote, “I like the red head. Seem fun and smart.” Epstein replied, “german jew.” Pigozzi then replied, “I like her / No tits. Small problem / Did Leon like her ?” (Pigozzi appears to be referring to fellow art collector Leon Black, whose connections to Epstein have been well documented.)\n\t\n\n\tIn another email chain, Pigozzi responds to an email from Epstein in which he sent an image (the image is not reproduced in the file): “Looks amazing / Can’t see any girls ???”\n\n\tThe documents also include a 2010 email chain between Pigozzi and “Gmax,” most likely Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime associate who was convicted of child sex trafficking in 2021. “Gmax” asks Pigozzi if he is planning to sell his properties in Panama and France, adding “If so price. Have potential interested party”; Pigozzi asks for a phone call before writing that the France property is 22.5 acres and that it “MUST BE OVER EURO 300M,” while for the Panama property, his asking price would be “OVER $ 150 M  JUST THE ISLAND 270 ACRES.”\n\n\tIn a phone call, Pigozzi told ARTnews that he did not remember any correspondence between him and Epstein about a “red head.” Regarding the prices for his Panama and France properties, he said he was not interested in selling it at the time, adding “I gave him some ridiculous price.”\n\n\tOf his connections with Epstein, Pigozzi said, “I never had anything to do with him and girls. Zero. Nothing. I also regret that I met him and Ghislaine.”\n\n\tPigozzi told ARTnews that he found his work in the art world a more interesting topic of conversation than “these stupid emails. I don’t find it so fascinating.” Pigozzi is a major collector of African art, with a focus on photography from the continent. He first started collecting in 1989 after seeing the Centre Pompidou’s influential “Magiciens de la Terre” exhibition that year.\n\t\n\n\tIn the decades since, he has amassed thousands of works from more than 160 artists from 22 sub-Saharan African countries, according to the collection’s website. The collection is currently based in Geneva but does not have a permanent exhibition space, though he told ARTnews he is currently at work building a space in Cannes.\n\n\tIn 2019, Pigozzi donated 45 works of contemporary African art to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The gift included pieces by Seydou Keïta, Romuald Hazoumè, Bodys Isek Kingelez, Moké, Chéri Samba, Ambroise Ngaimoko/Studio 3Z, and Frédéric Bruly Bouabré. At the time, MoMA called the donation “transformative” as it would make the museum “a unique institutional leader in this aspect of contemporary African art.”\n\n\tPigozzi’s holdings include dozens of photographs by Keïta, many of which are currently on view in a survey of the late photographer’s work at the Brooklyn Museum. The Jean Pigozzi African Art Collection is specifically thanked in the exhibition’s credits.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEarlier this month, Christie’s promoted Kimberly Miller to global managing director of its luxury operation, a move that comes as the category continues to outpace much of the auction market. \n\n\tIn December, the house reported that in the first half of last year, luxury sales jumped 30 percent, compared to the same period in 2024. The jump came as the house’s overall first-half results remained flat. That momentum carried through the rest of the year. In Geneva in November, the Mellon Blue—a hulking diamond—sold for $25.6 million, making it the most expensive jewel to sell at auction in 2025. The result helped push that week’s sales up 24 percent compared with 2024. Taken together, Christie’s luxury sales reached $795 million in 2025, a 17 percent increase from the prior year. That increase well outpacing its overall growth last year of 7 percent.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tMiller steps into the global role after serving as regional managing director for luxury in the Americas, where she oversaw strategy and performance across jewelry, watches, wine, and handbags. During that time, she helped integrate California-based automotive auction house Gooding & Company into Christie’s following its acquisition in 2022, expanding the house’s footprint in high-end collectibles and luxury vehicles. She also led the relaunch of wine auctions in New York, including the sale of billionaire Bill Koch’s cellar, which brought in nearly $30 million and became the most successful single-collection wine sale in North American history.\n\n\tJewelry has been another key driver. Christie’s sold nine of the ten most expensive jewels at auction last year, including a sold-out “Magnificent Jewels” sale in Geneva this May that totaled $72 million.\n\n\tAfter over 15 years at Christie’s, Miller now oversees the auction house’s global luxury business, collaborating with teams in Geneva, Hong Kong, London, New York, and Paris. ARTnews sat down with Miller to discuss her plans to push the luxury business even further.\n\n\tThe interview has been edited lightly for clarity and concision.\n\n\tARTnews: Art sales have softened in recent years, even as luxury categories continue to perform strongly. How does Christie’s see luxury fitting into its broader business model?\n\t\n\n\tKimberly Miller: Christie’s views luxury as both a stabilizer and a strategic growth engine within our broader business model. It has consistently remained a critical entry point for new client engagement and acquisition. Our categories of jewelry, watches, wine, and handbags have a broader cultural familiarity and span a range of price points, which tend to make them more approachable for first-time buyers. For many, bidding on a bottle of wine or a piece of jewelry feels like a more accessible first step into the auction world than acquiring a higher-value work of art.\n\n\tAs a result, luxury serves as an effective on-ramp into the Christie’s ecosystem, from which clients can migrate into fine and decorative art, among other categories. Luxury also continues to perform strongly relative to other sectors, even though this segment, too, has undergone a recalibration following the 2022 market peak. While macro- and microeconomic factors have driven a broader correction, the category remains meaningfully above 2020 levels and has demonstrated resilience year on year. This consistency helps offset softness in some art segments and contributes to overall revenue stability during cyclical downturns.\n\n\tChristie’s has said many new and younger clients are entering through luxury. What’s driving that shift?\n\t\n\n\tThe shift is twofold. First, luxury is a broad and approachable entry point for many novice collectors. Second, it is a market particularly well suited to a digitally driven environment—a trend that accelerated notably in 2020. When the world went into lockdown during Covid, many novice and younger clients used that time to self-educate in areas of personal interest, with luxury categories proving especially engaging.\n\n\tAt the same time, there was a rapid transformation of the digital ecosystem. Confidence in online purchasing increased, platforms became more intuitive, and as a result, many Gen Z and Millennial collectors now come to Christie’s well informed, valuing digital engagement and speed alongside the access, expertise, and transparency that auctions provide.\n\n\tReflecting this shift, the number of online luxury auctions has more than doubled compared with pre-Covid levels and continues to deliver our most consistent sell-through rates. Christie’s has always emphasized education and specialist expertise to build bidder confidence, and we are increasingly supporting self-directed online learning through category-specific collecting guides.\n\n\tSustainability is also increasingly important among Gen Z and Millennial collectors and is integral to Christie’s business practices today. We are aligned with leading climate organizations, are SBTi approved with targets to reduce emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, and are members of the Gallery Climate Coalition. Across luxury, we’ve expanded digital offerings and reduced the printing and distribution of catalogs, while introducing more sustainable packaging for purchased lots.\n\t\n\n\tAre luxury buyers increasingly overlapping with art collectors?\n\n\tThere has historically been strong overlap—it’s fundamentally a community galvanized by a shared passion for quality, authenticity, storytelling, and stewardship. At the highest levels of collecting, that crossover is particularly strong, as these clients are motivated to acquire the best and rarest objects across multiple categories.\n\n\tAt the same time, luxury categories remain highly individualized, with distinct client bases and motivations. That makes it an interesting and challenging problem to solve, so we tailor content, marketing, and experiences to specific audiences rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach. That might mean a moderated panel discussion on independent makers in jewelry and watches one day, a highly curated wine dinner the next, or a private gallery tour for fine art clients. This allows us to foster cross-category engagement where it’s natural, while preserving the integrity of each category.\n\n\tSotheby’s has expanded aggressively in the Middle East. How is Christie’s approaching the region?\n\n\tChristie’s has always taken a very client-centric approach to growth, and that philosophy guides how we think about the Middle East. Rather than building initiatives for their own sake, we focus on meeting collectors where they are and supporting them in ways that feel authentic to the region.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to watch auctions and category sponsorships in Dubai, we opened an office in Saudi Arabia last year, led by Nour Kelani—the first time a major international auction house established a presence in the Kingdom. That move reflects both the depth of engagement we’re seeing and our commitment to serving clients locally. While we’re exploring future programming across auctions and private sales, nothing is ready to be announced.\n\n\tChristie’s acquisition of Gooding brought cars into the mix. How important is that category?\n\n\tAt just one year post-acquisition, the car category has quickly become a meaningful contributor to Christie’s overall luxury sales and an important growth area. In our first year of car sales as Gooding Christie’s, the department delivered its highest-grossing year since 2003, realizing more than $234 million across four auctions. Looking ahead, we’re excited about expanding Gooding Christie’s into EMEA in 2026.\n\n\tYou led the relaunch of wine auctions in New York. What did that reveal about collector behavior?\n\n\tRelaunching wine sales underscored how intrinsically wine collecting is tied to community and shared experiences. The Collection of William I. Koch achieved a record-setting $28.8 million and reflected strong demand across regions and price points, with a clear preference for online bidding due to speed and convenience. We’re also seeing continued appetite for experiential lots that pair wine or spirits with access to producers and makers.\n\t\n\n\tAs luxury grows, how do you ensure it doesn’t overshadow Christie’s identity as an art institution?\n\n\tLuxury complements rather than competes with Christie’s identity as an art institution. When we maintain the same level of scholarship, provenance, and connoisseurship across every category, luxury broadens our audience and deepens engagement with Christie’s as a whole.And finally, how might the news about LMVH’s shares dropping—and the slower than expected recovery of the luxury market—impact Christie’s luxury business?\n\n\tI would say the likelihood of a material impact on Christie’s Luxury business is medium to low. Auction dynamics differ from the primary market, and while LVMH and Kering are industry bellwethers, their recent results were shaped largely by fashion, leather goods, and exposure to China. By contrast, their Jewelry and Watch segment—more comparable to Christie’s auction categories—was up 8 percent for the quarter. Christie’s Luxury also delivered strong sales and sell-through rates in the second half of the year, with auctions up 17 percent versus FY 2024.\n\n\tMuch of Christie’s Luxury business is driven by the top end of the market, where demand for ultra-rare, high-value objects remains strong. The Marie-Thérèse Pink Diamond, which sold for $14 million in New York this June against a $5–7 million estimate, is a clear example. Provenance, quality, rarity, and aesthetics continue to drive competitive bidding, alongside a strong year for Luxury Private Sales. While growth has moderated since 2022, the market remains above 2020 levels, and despite ongoing economic uncertainty, I remain cautiously optimistic for the year ahead.\n",

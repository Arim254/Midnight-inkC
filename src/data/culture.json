    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMad­man or vision­ary? A lit­tle of both? A genius? A brand? A men­sch? David Lynch was all these things and more, and this fan-made video above serves as a quick reminder of the career and the con­sis­ten­cy of the film director/artist/transcendental med­i­ta­tor who passed away last year.\nEar­ly in the video we see one of the director’s pub­lic­i­ty stunts, when he sat in a chair on the cor­ner of La Brea and Hol­ly­wood, next to a cow and a large poster of Lau­ra Dern. No, the cow had noth­ing to do with the film he was promoting—2006’s Inland Empire—but it did stop traf­fic and draw atten­tion. Lynch didn’t have an adver­tis­ing bud­get to pro­mote Lau­ra Dern’s lead role in the film, so the cow had to do.\nLau­ra Dern appeared in a major­i­ty of Lynch’s films begin­ning with 1986’s Blue Vel­vet, and the video hon­ors their friend­ship (he called her “Tid­bit”) as well as his col­lab­o­ra­tions with Kyle MacLach­lan (who Lynch called “Kale”) and Nao­mi Watts. All three obvi­ous­ly adored him.\nThere’s also a com­pi­la­tion of Lynch swear­ing like a champ. Prod­uct place­ment in film is “bull­shit,” prob­lems on set are “fuck­ing nuts,” and for those who sat through the “peanut sweep­ing” scene in Twin Peaks The Return, you’ll under­stand his out­burst on set: “Who gives a fuc&ing $hit how long a scene is?”\nWe’ve linked pre­vi­ous­ly to Lynch’s video where he makes quinoa, and this short edit sums up that video nice­ly. It’s also nice to see atten­tion giv­en to The Straight Sto­ry, which usu­al­ly gets passed over in his fil­mog­ra­phy, despite (or maybe because of) being his sweet­est movie.\nThere’s also a reminder that Lynch made videos from quar­an­tine in his Los Ange­les home. Not only did he deliv­er the dai­ly weath­er reports like he used to, but he also announced “Today’s Num­ber,” which caused quite a lot of anx­i­ety in the YouTube com­ments. (Why no sev­en? WHY NO NUMBER 7?)\nThe video ends with Lynch’s the­o­ry about catch­ing ideas like fish—we’ve also high­light­ed this before—and then a love­ly mon­tage of title cards, remind­ing us all that “Direct­ed by David Lynch” remains a guar­an­teed sign of qual­i­ty.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nTwin Peaks Actu­al­ly Explained: A 4‑Hour Video Essay Demys­ti­fies It All\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nDavid Lynch Made a Dis­turb­ing Web Sit­com Called “Rab­bits”: It’s Now Used by Psy­chol­o­gists to Induce a Sense of Exis­ten­tial Cri­sis in Research Sub­jects\nPat­ti Smith and David Lynch Talk About the Source of Their Ideas & Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nApart from a few bridges that still work, the infra­struc­tur­al achieve­ments of the Roman Empire exist, for us, most­ly as ruins. With a lit­tle imag­i­na­tion, those his­toric sites give us a clear enough sense of the empire’s sheer might, but if we want to go deep­er, we should then look into the numer­ous Roman con­struc­tions that haven’t sur­vived at all. In the video below from his chan­nel Told in Stone, ancient-his­to­ry YouTu­ber Gar­rett Ryan gives his per­son­al top sev­en “lost Roman won­ders,” begin­ning with Trajan’s Bridge, whose length of more than a kilo­me­ter across the Danube made it the longest bridge ever built at that time: a project of ambi­tions befit­ting a man that his­to­ry remem­bers as one of the “Five Good Emper­ors.”\nNo such sta­tus for Nero, though he did com­mis­sion the Subi­a­co Dams. Nec­es­sary to cre­ate a series of arti­fi­cial lakes beneath the infa­mous ruler’s vil­la, they were the high­est dams in exis­tence until the Mid­dle Ages. Hadri­an’s more pub­lic-mind­ed white-mar­ble tem­ple at Cyz­i­cus in mod­ern-day Turkey was known as unusu­al­ly splen­did even by the stan­dards of that genre of build­ing; now only its foun­da­tions remain, with archae­o­log­i­cal digs turn­ing up the occa­sion­al frag­ment.\nIn the for­mer Con­stan­tino­ple, the Church of the Holy Apos­tles is remem­bered as the sec­ond-most famous van­ished ear­ly Chris­t­ian church, after only the old St. Peter’s Basil­i­ca in Rome. Hagia Sophia may still be around, but the Col­umn of Jus­tin­ian that once stood between it and the Great Palace was melt­ed down for scrap long ago.\n\n\n\t\n\nWe only know of these lost struc­tures because we have his­tor­i­cal attes­ta­tions of their exis­tence, most vivid­ly in paint­ings: take the Pyra­mid of Romu­lus, a strik­ing tomb that appears near the Vat­i­can in The Vision of the Cross, which Raphael’s assis­tants pro­duced after his death. Oth­ers, like the Colos­sus of Nero from which the Colos­se­um takes its name, are rep­re­sent­ed on coins. In the video at the top, Ryan cov­ers three more “for­got­ten Roman megapro­jects”: Claudius’ tun­nel of record-mak­ing length through the moun­tain between the Riv­er Liris and the Fucine Lake, Tra­jan’s mil­i­tary high­way through the “Iron Gates” of the Danube, and Octa­vian’s secret har­bor at Lake Aver­nus. In our time, of course, there are no more emper­ors, Roman or oth­er­wise, and we’re sure­ly bet­ter off for it. But we can still admire — to use a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­cept — the state capac­i­ty they com­mand­ed.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Genius Engi­neer­ing of Roman Aque­ducts\nThe Roman Colos­se­um Decon­struct­ed: 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals the Hid­den Tech­nol­o­gy That Pow­ered Rome’s Great Are­na\nThe Amaz­ing Engi­neer­ing of Roman Baths\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

All works \"Untitled\" (2025), acrylic-painted MDF (image courtesy the Art Institute of Chicago)\n    \n        \n            CHICAGO — Seeing a sculpture by Diane Simpson is nothing like seeing a sculpture by any other artist. Chicagoans can currently experience this in person on the rooftop terrace of the Art Institute of Chicago, where her first three outdoor sculptures ever are on display, and at the gallery Corbett vs. Dempsey, which features two classics in a group show.Sculpture in the round traditionally proceeds in logically continuous increments. As you circle a baroque Bernini or modern Rodin or postmodern Charles Ray, you and the sculpture are on the same three-dimensional plane of existence. Not so with a Simpson. From one angle it appears deep, but from another flat; here it looks angled, there not. The different sides of her constructions simply do not agree with one another. The technical reason for this confusion is that Simpson first finds inspiration in a three-dimensional object — samurai armor, chairs, and bonnets have all been prompts — and then drafts some aspect of her source using isometric projection, a drawing style common in engineering diagrams and geometry classes, as well as historical Chinese and Japanese scrolls. It employs parallel projection and consistent angles, such that objects at a distance do not appear smaller than close ones, as in single-point perspective. So far so good. But then Simpson does something crazy — she transposes her drawing into a three-dimensional sculpture while maintaining those angles and parallels, thereby creating an artwork that makes no sense in real space. Encountering her constructions is like walking around inside a drawing. Other writers have had great fun with comparisons, my favorite being to the scene in Pixar’s Inside Out, when Bing-Bong, Sadness, and Joy take a shortcut through the world of abstract thought and temporarily become fragmented, deconstructed, two-dimensional, and then linear.Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Rocket Launcher\" (2025), acrylic-painted MDF (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Born in 1935 in Joliet, a small city on the outskirts of Chicago, Simpson has been at this for a long time. Is she having a moment? Sort of, at least relative to her age — 90 — and the career’s worth of milestones she’s achieved in the past decade or so: Her first inclusion in the Whitney Biennial, first retrospective, first international shows, first museum solo shows, first outdoor commission, first multi-gallery representation. Before that, Simpson exhibited primarily in Chicago, more or less frequently, depending on trends and connections and luck, good and bad. Her longevity has more than made up for her late start (she delayed the completion of her BFA at the School of the Art Institute for 10 years and three children). While her peers’ MFA studios were downtown, hers was in the dining room of her family’s home in Wilmette, a suburb north of Chicago. That’s where she first began to experiment with large sheets of corrugated cardboard, easy to pack flat and transport into the city, then assemble out of interlocking planes. Those sculptures filled her first gallery show, held in 1979 at the women’s co-op Artemisia, and most were not seen again until her 2020 solo exhibition at Wesleyan University. Simpson still lives and works in that suburban house, her art spread out through the attic, garage, spare bedroom, and basement. Her late husband, Ken, a pioneering medical ethicist and all-around champion of his wife’s art practice, made her studio tables, lunch, and much else. Now her grandsons do the installation. Artists need all kinds of support to succeed professionally, from the emotional to the administrative; most often, it’s been men who’ve had it in the form of their spouses. Over the course of her career, Diane Simpson flipped more than just two and three dimensions. Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Neckline - extended\" (2011), LDF, aluminum, enamel, colored pencil, on view at Corbett vs. Dempsey gallery, Chicago (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Thinly Veiled\" (1985), oil stain on MDF, fiberglass screening, pencil, on view at Corbett vs. Dempsey gallery, Chicago (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Simpson divides her oeuvre into multi-year series. Each grouping has a common starting point, from headgear to window dressing. After the initial drawings comes translation into three dimensions using an ever-evolving array of unexpected materials — which generally have zero connection to the original inspiration: linoleum, various types of wood, metal sheeting, meshes, copper tubing, leather, corrugated plastic, foam board, printed fabrics. Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is a longtime favorite. Fabricating everything fastidiously and from scratch, without assistants, out of components not designed to do what she asks of them, has resulted in years of inventiveness. Her joints are especially clever, accomplished through rivets, lacing, wrapping, and interlocking. Curvatures are achieved by scoring and bending, or, as in a roll-top desk, by affixing bands of a hard material to textile backing. In a group show at Corbett vs. Dempsey, Simpson has two neutral-toned sculptures that bear this all out delightfully. “Thinly Veiled” (1985) belongs to a series inspired by historical European dress, including a man’s pantaloon and cape circa 1562 and a whalebone underskirt, or “pannier,” of about 1750. From a certain angle, “Thinly Veiled” echoes the form of a woman’s head covering, but to me it mostly reads as a model for a tropical apartment building, ship-like, with plentiful halfmoon balconies swathed in mosquito netting. Architecture studios used to present their proposals like this, out of light brown MDF, on a simple base, with pencilled-in details and tacked on fiberglass screening. “Neckline – extended” (2011), part of a grouping devoted to bibs, vests, collars, and tunics, stands seven feet tall and cascades like a hard waterfall down a series of thin ledges. Back up far enough and squint, and those aluminum ledges become the silhouette of a neck and shoulders, the beige LDF waterfall a high collar connected to a plunging V-neck. From the side, what it is is anyone’s guess. From behind, I spy a curio shelf with curved brackets and, above it, a shelf holding an upright open book.Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Grenade\" (2025), acrylic-painted MDF (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic) (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Note that the outline of neck and shoulders does not define a person, but a garment. Likewise, under that veil is empty space. Simpson, for all her interest in clothing, never includes bodies. Think exoskeleton, the thing that shapes a body, and not the other way around. From there it’s not a far leap to her latest work, devoted to the applied arts of furniture and architectural detailing. Good for Future, her exhibit of three new commissions on the roof of the Art Institute, belongs to this set. The irresistible title was a note-to-self Simpson wrote in the 1980s on a roll of drawings of unrealized sculptures. Here they are now, in alternating shades of periwinkle, sky blue, and olive, doing many of the things her artworks always do, plus a few novelties. The newest is being made with the help of an assistant, due to the heaviness of exterior-grade MDF. The bases have a fresh treatment, painted with black lines that coordinate with their skewed planes, like the graph paper of her preparatory drawings. Set outdoors against the Chicago skyline, the work invites comparison with a century and a half of high-rises, whose forms reverberate in Simpson’s, at least from certain angles. From others, I glimpse a giant perfume bottle, a seesaw, a Japanese roofline, and maybe an elephant. Also: a monumental grenade, a rocket launcher, and a fortress.

The piece, a massive 22-by-32-foot installation, will transform the museum’s floor-to-ceiling window in the Sunley Gallery overlooking Margate’s beaches and the North Sea.Running from April 1 to November 1, the window work depicts a sunrise in Normandy, based on an iPad painting Hockney created in 2020. Clarrie Wallis, the director of Turner Contemporary, said in a statement that “illuminated at night, the work becomes a point of light on the seafront.”\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tTurner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and welcomed over 322,000 visitors in the 2023-24 year, is inspired by the life and work of JMW Turner. Hockney has said he draws inspiration from the iconic landscape painter; back in 2007, the Bradford-born artist co-curated an exhibition of Turner’s watercolours at Tate Britain.\n\t\n\n\tHockney fever shows no sign of slowing down in the UK. Next month, London’s Serpentine Galleries opens its first-ever show by the octogenarian artist from March 12 to August 23. The exhibition will feature a new body of work, including five still lifes and five portraits of people close to Hockney, including family members to carers.\n\n\tVisitors will also get a glimpse of A Year in Normandy (2020–21), a 90-metre-long frieze inspired by the Bayeux Tapestry that tracks the changing seasons at Hockney’s former Normandy studio. The Bayeux Tapestry itself is set to go on display at the British Museum later this year. Earlier this year, Hockney described moving the tapestry to London as “madness,” warning that the “beautiful as well as historically important” piece could be damaged. However, the British Museum’s director Nicholas Cullinan has disputed the claim.Hockey continues to be a huge draw. His 2017 retrospective at Tate Britain saw over 478,000 visitors, while last year the largest-ever exhibition of his work at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris was also a hit.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tHenrike Naumann, a sculptor whose installations composed of furniture and design objects associated with East Germany’s troubled past made her a star of the German art scene, died on Saturday at 41.\n\n\tHer death preceded one of her biggest projects to date: the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, where the Berlin-based artist is set to represent the nation alongside Sung Tieu this year. The Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen (ifa), the organization that facilitates the German Pavilion, said in a statement that she died of a “short, serious illness.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“With Henrike Naumann’s passing, we have lost not only a significant figure in contemporary German art, but also a warm-hearted, insightful, and highly committed individual,” ifa said. “Her legacy lives on – in her works, in the numerous international collaborations she initiated, and in the many people who were inspired by her thinking and work.”\n\n\tNaumann’s art was by turns disturbing, intriguing, and heartfelt, attesting to a Germany that remains unsettled well after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Often working with ready-made objects that she acquired and assembled to form installations, she produced art that seemed ordinary, perhaps even a little banal, which was by design. Her “aesthetic of reunification,” as she termed it, was intended to feel eerily familiar.\n\n\tShe sourced many of the objects through eBay Kleinanzeigen, a website through which Germans can sell their goods to one another. “I read and research a lot as part of my process, but I really start to create the language to express a certain idea in an installation by looking at what people do, at how they post their furniture—usually on my phone,” she told Pin-Up in 2022.\n\n\tIn another interview conducted that same year for Bomb, she said, “I love to look for things that I think cannot exist. And then it often turns out they do exist. And then I need to get them.”\n\n\tThe objects she acquired sometimes had histories that seemed impossibly rich. For one 2018 show at the Museum Abteiberg in Mönchengladbach, Germany, she featured a painted portrait of the conservative politician Birgit Breuel, who served as president of the controversial Treuhandanstalt, a holding firm that supervised East German assets following reunification. Naumann discovered the painting in the archives for Expo 2000, a World Expo held in Hanover that Breuel helped lead. Critic Kito Nedo reported in Frieze that the painting had been gifted by the United Arab Emirates to the German Pavilion at that event. “In this weird, telling picture, the capitalist manager is depicted as a force in the ‘wilderness’ of an empty, postsocialist landscape,” Nedo wrote.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHenrike Naumann, 14 Words, 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy the artist and MMK Frankfurt\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAnother memorable installation from 2018, titled 14 Words, involved the acquisition of the entire interior of a flower shop. Shown at the MMK Frankfurt museum that year, the installation may have seemed innocent to those unfamiliar with the history surrounding it, which was decidedly dark. The piece’s title obliquely referred to the slogan used by a neo-Nazi; Naumann connected that white supremacist to the National Socialist Underground, a German group whose racist killings targeted such people as Enver Şimşek, a Turkish-born German who operated a flower shop in Nuremberg when he was murdered in 2000.\n\n\tYet the vast majority of the objects Naumann’s installations did not appear to contain objects imbued with narratives like that one. Ostalgie (Urgesellschaft), from 2019, featured a carpet, a couch, a rotary phone, and other objects that would have been familiar to most residents in the GDR. Naumann placed these objects on the wall of KOW gallery, where items that normally might have appeared on a wall—framed portraits and the like—were exhibited on the floor. With this exhibition, Naumann created “spaces that mixed Nazi lineages and ecstatic rave culture, the Stone Age and the GDR, to refute simplistic characterizations of the East before and after reunification,” Emily Watlington wrote in Art in America.\n\t\n\n\tHenrike Naumann was born in 1984 in Zwickau, East Germany. She spent much of her early years with her grandparents while her parents continued their studies. Her grandfather, Karl Heinz Jakob, worked in the GDR, and so, she told Bomb, “my early art education was impacted by a socialist understanding of art and education as things that should be accessible for everyone in society.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstallation of “Henrike Naumann: Re-education,” 2022, at SculptureCenter, New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy SculptureCenter\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRather than studying painting or sculpture, as artists tend to do, she instead enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts Dresden’s program for costume and stage design. Then, at the Film University Potsdam-Babelsberg, she studied set design for film and television productions, graduating in 2012. She attributed her artistic approach to her education. “I want to make sense of every angle, conceptually and literally,” she told Pin-Up.\n\n\tOne of her earliest mature works was an installation about the National Socialist Underground, the group that killed Şimşek, the subject of 14 Words. Some of the NSU’s members lived in Zwickau, the city where Naumann was born, though this didn’t come to light until 2011. The year afterward, Naumann produced Triangular Stories (2012), an installation containing what purported to be home videos belonging to NSU members. In fact, even though they seemed to have been shot in 1992, these videos had been newly produced by Naumann.\n\t\n\n\tIn the decade and a half after that installation, Naumann ascended quickly in Germany’s art scene. In 2022, she exhibited at Documenta 15 via the Ghetto Biennale, a participant that was nominated to bring on other artists of its choosing. This year, she will become one of the few East German artists ever to represent Germany at the Venice Biennale.\n\n\tInternationally, she was also beginning to receive greater exposure, thanks in part to her US debut at SculptureCenter in 2022. That show featured the installation Horseshoe Theory (2022), in which Naumann arranged chairs, stools, and other pieces of furniture in a U shape, referencing the theory that the right and the left wings are more aligned the further one moves from the political center. The work also alluded to a memeified version of this thinking that applied to chair design.\n\n\tViewers who knew little about the GDR might have struggled to keep up with Naumann’s references, but she insisted that her work remained legible to those audiences, if not on an intellectual level, then on an emotional one. “You can obviously bring in aspects of theory to be decoded, but furniture, to me, belongs to public, political memory,” she told Pin-Up.\n",

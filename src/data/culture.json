    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 2019, Cornwall-based artists William Arnold and James Fergusson began paying a lot of attention to wild apple trees growing in unique and sometimes unlikely locations around the Cornish countryside. Remarkably, every apple seed is capable of producing an entirely different variety. And it’s this immense genome that inspired the pair to begin their ongoing project called Some Interesting Apples.\nApple cultivars that we often see in supermarkets, like Gala or Honeycrisp, need to be carefully produced in a process called clonal propagation, in which a cutting from a desirable tree is grafted onto a new one, creating, essentially, a copy. Because even if a Honeycrisp seed sprouted and produced a tree, it wouldn’t be another Honeycrisp!\n\n\n\nArnold and Fergusson have discovered more than 600 wild apple varieties throughout Cornwall over the past seven years. Arnold is a photographer and visually documents new types, while the duo revels in finding and sampling the wide array of “feral” varieties that grow along roadsides and in parks across the county. A new short film, produced by Ffern, rounds up some of the duo’s tasting notes.\nRather than giving individual names to hundreds of different apples, some of which are sweet and dessert-like and some of which are almost too tart to bear, Arnold and Fergusson assign them a what3words designation, using the wayfinding app popular in the U.K. that denotes specific places using three random words rather than GPS coordinates or traditional street addresses.\nThe what3words location for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, is cage.rocks.gladiators. For Some Interesting Apples, the unique codes provide a useful, sometimes absurd, and occasionally poetic way to label different varieties based on where the trees were found, like a “horse wish gossip” apple, or a “bats prefer flame” variety.\nIn 2023, in collaboration with the University of Exeter and the National Trust, Arnold and Fergusson spearheaded a unique project called The Wilding Mother Orchard, situated near Helford, which has been established with dozens of wild root stocks. The orchard is not only a celebration of the fruit’s natural diversity but also a way of broaching how the effects of the climate crisis may alter our access to varieties we take for granted in the future.\n\n“People get alarmed when they realise that the heritage apple varieties they love might not survive in a climate-changed world,” Arnold told the BBC. “They don’t appreciate that we are surrounded by unique wild apple volunteers that may be better adapted to future conditions.”\nSee the short film on Vimeo, and check out Arnold’s photographs on his website.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInstallation view of R. Crumb: Tales of Paranoia at David Zwirner, Los Angeles (photo Tulsa Kinney/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nLOS ANGELES — R. Crumb has a new comic book! After a 23-year hiatus, Tales of Paranoia comes out this month, published by Fantagraphics, and the underground comic guru is exhibiting original drawings from the book at David Zwirner gallery.\nThe exhibition comprises original illustrated panels included in the comic book along with a few other recent drawings and excerpts from his sketchbooks. Now a widowed octogenarian based in France, his latest work demonstrates the same masterful rendering of his subjects, sans his prurient material. However, his witty humor, self-deprecation, paranoia, narcissism, anti-establishment commentary, and self-proclaimed neurosis — almost to a point of pride — have reached a new level of darkness. Clearly, he misses his wife and collaborator, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, who passed away in 2022. Her absence seems to have heightened his self-awareness and self-reflection. Left to his own devices, he explores his afflictions — and now mortality. “What does it all mean at this point in life?” he seems to muse.\n\nPage from R. Crumb, “What is Paranoia?” (2025) (© Robert Crumb, 2025, courtesy the artist, Paul Morris, and David Zwirner)\nA panel made in collaboration with Aline and their daughter, Sophie, “Crumb Family Covid Exposé” (2021), shows how the pandemic threw him into a tailspin, as he tunneled down a rabbit hole of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. He is an anti-vaxxer who deeply mistrusts the government and freaks out behind his wife’s back as she makes sure to get her vaccines. The two of them draw themselves in each panel from their own perspectives. \nIn “The Very Worst LSD I Ever Had” (2023) — one of the most disturbing stories — Crumb revisits a bad acid trip that has haunted him since it happened in 1966. What bothered him most about the experience was how it was blocked from his memory. Crumb was no stranger to psychedelics, but this trip left him paranoid. He and his first wife, Dana, had visited a house they heard was giving out the drug; after taking it, he became convinced that they were part of a science project. When Crumb explained his feelings to Peter Cornell, who doled out the drug, Cornell responded, “And now you’re going to die.” \nWith a long history in the comic world, Crumb caught national attention in the 1960s through his unique art. His crosshatching, done with his favorite tool, the Rapidograph pen, soon established his signature style, while album and book covers brought his work into mainstream pop culture, particularly the iconic 1968 Janis Joplin album Cheap Thrills.\nInstallation view of R. Crumb: Tales of Paranoia at David Zwirner, Los Angeles (photo Angel Xotlanihua, courtesy David Zwirner)\nCrumb’s work has long been embraced by the fine art world. This latest series of comics are now neatly matted and framed in Zwirner’s second gallery. To break up the monotony of the presentation, the back wall is painted a bright mustard yellow, with the title of the show, and a seating area is set up with a few of his books to peruse. (Too bad one can’t rip a drawing off the wall to sit with and read; standing for hours reading the comics can become challenging, if not straight-up tiring.)\nMany of Crumb’s personality traits don’t exactly match up: He’s liberal-minded but against vaccines; self-doubting but confident; a monogamist with a wandering eye. He is a mixed-up guy and is not afraid to put it all on display — perhaps for his own catharsis. In this new series he mainly concentrates on his paranoia with the vaccine and the political overseers, not trusting anyone. Two panels of “Conspiracy Theories!” (2025) are just text, spelling out the dire situation of today’s political climate. It’s difficult to get through the dense text, but a few gems stand out: “Large numbers of people now harbor suspicions that there was something phony or rigged about the whole pandemic narrative,” “What’s really going on?,” “Where does one turn for reliable sources of information,” and in big black block lettering, “QUESTION AUTHORITY.” One could easily walk away from this exhibition with a sense of doom.\nWhat is unusual about this new work, especially for me, is that I find myself sympathizing with him. The authenticity of his emotions — his feelings of helplessness and paranoia — can get to you. A cover line on his comic book, Tales of Paranoianstallation , says in a big yellow starburst, “Batshit Crazy or True Persception — Who Can Tell?” That pretty much sums it up. Welcome to Crumb’s world of 2025 — it’s not a pretty picture.\n\nPage from R.

An Incomplete Haunting, an exhibition at 601Artspace curated by Rachel Raphaela Gugelberger, is part of Fall of Freedom, a decentralized series of events across the United States on November 21 and 22 opposing growing authoritarianism and censorship. Three of its 14 artists and collectives — Kris Grey, Miguel Luciano, and Dread Scott — co-organized Fall of Freedom and are listed as initiators of the exhibition. But curator Gugelberger submitted the curatorial proposal for An Incomplete Haunting two years ago, before Trump’s reelection. Indeed, its themes — that we are the ghosts of history, products of systems and decisions that continue to reverberate — suggest ideas that have long been percolating in the ether as the country barrels toward fascism. But in an increasingly numbed world, where atrocities are scrolled past and claims about power and resistance are further leeched of meaning with each successive repetition, the exhibition’s greatest success is in making those ideas viscerally and urgently present. \nThis exhibition trades in art’s auratic power; its objects assert the power of collective memory. Kenneth Tam’s “Why Do You Abuse Me” (2022) consists of the earth from sites along the Transcontinental Railroad, where many Chinese laborers died amid perilous working conditions and low wages in the 1860s. Embedded with dried fruits, seeds, mushrooms, and other sources of physical and spiritual nourishment, and standing almost preternaturally erect on one coin-edge to block your path, the piece feels almost alive. Meanwhile, Kris Grey’s “Capital T” (2025) consists of weathered wooden beams that I initially read as a crucifix; I could feel their weariness, the burden of persecution. Only upon reading the curatorial essay did I learn that it was salvaged from the dance floor of the original Stonewall Inn, the site of one of the most pivotal rebellions in queer history. Suddenly, an event I’d encountered only through repeated historical reference was startlingly, physically present. \nInstallation view of Kenneth Tam, “Why Do You Abuse Me” (2022), epoxy resin, dirt, sand, dried mushrooms, dried seaweed, dried bamboo shoots, dried jujube, dried goji berries, preserved apricots, sunflower seeds, dried roots, dried sweet potato, and steel\nOne notable — and slightly unusual — emphasis in this show is on recreations and reenactments, suggesting that there are more impactful ways to tell the truth than simply recounting what happened and offering another channel to feel history in the now. The late Nona Faustine’s “Dorothy Angola, Stay Free, In Land of the Blacks, Minetta Lane, the Village, NYC” (2021), for instance, brings the deeply buried history of one of the first enslaved women trafficked here by the Dutch West India Company in the 1600s back to the fore by embodying her ghost: Faustine stands in the center of a former semi-free Black settlement in all white, looking straight into the camera. Mark Tribe’s Port Huron Project (2006–8) documents reenactments of iconic protest speeches on location; hearing the same words spoken in the same space, you feel the presence of past audiences and part of the same movement as them — a thread continued by Andrea Ray’s “The Sound of Women’s Rights” (2020/25), which interweaves voices from the 1970s with those of the past decade. \nThat may be An Incomplete Haunting and Fall of Freedom’s most important act: bringing us together to feel history as a shared, living force, and refusing to let that feeling dissipate when we leave.\n\nInstallation view of An Incomplete Haunting\n\nInstallation view of An Incomplete Haunting\n\nKris Grey, “Capital T” (2025), salvaged wooden joists from Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center\n\nInstallation view of An Incomplete Haunting\n\nMark Tribe, “The Liberation of Our People: Angela Davis” (1969/2008)\n\nInstallation view of Andrea Ray, “The Sound of Women’s Rights” (2020/2025), stoneware with glaze, steel with finish, speaker, audio equipment, 5-minute audio on loop\nAn Incomplete Haunting continues at 601Artspace (88 Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, Manhattan) through February 22, 2026.

    "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO — In an unassuming back room in the Catherine Clark Gallery in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, among stored canvases, sits a 2,000-pound replica of the White House. Step closer, and you’ll notice the unmistakable cylindrical form of a bullet, and then of many, many bullets.\nThe rust-colored replica, over six feet wide, was made in 2018 from repurposed bullets, gun parts, shell casings, and glass by sculptor Al Farrow, based in San Rafael, a town about 20 minutes north of San Francisco. “White House” is priced at $500,000 and is on view indefinitely at the Catherine Clark Gallery, years after its creation and museum tour, reappearing to the public in time for the Fall of Freedom series of nationwide art and protest actions this weekend. The artist spoke at the gallery on Friday, November 21, during a special viewing, one of hundreds of cultural events across the country opposing authoritarianism.\nIn a phone interview with Hyperallergic, Farrow said he felt the work took on a renewed significance under the second Trump administration.\n“Trump got elected and I just said, ‘Look, I think the White House is more relevant now than when I made it, and it’s more relevant than anything else I have to show,’” Farrow recalled of his conversation with his gallerist when they decided to display the work again.\nThe work is on view indefinitely in a room at the Catherine Clark Gallery\nFarrow said the idea first occurred to him during George W. Bush’s presidency, but when Barack Obama was elected in 2008, he stopped planning the work, citing a feeling of hope. Nearly a decade later, when Trump was elected in 2016, he picked it back up. \nThe recreation of the White House marks a thematic departure from many of Farrow’s other sculptures, which include models of synagogues, mosques, and Christian churches comprised of munitions.\nIn these religious architectural renderings, Farrow critiques a hypocritical connection between religion and violence. Farrow, who comes from a Jewish background and describes himself as an atheist, has been critical of Israel’s violence against Palestinians in Gaza and has included Uzi guns, a weapon once used by the Israeli military, in his works. His cathedral sculpture “The Spine and Tooth of Santo Guerro” (2008), titled after a fictional saint, is also comprised of gun parts and bullets and resides in the collection of San Francisco’s de Young Museum.\n\nRear view of White House\nIn the 2000s, though, Farrow wanted to move away from religious iconography. Farrow said “White House” was one of his original secular concepts, and also the largest sculpture he’s made since he got his start in the 1970s.\nRather than scaling the work based on the White House, Farrow based the dimensions of his presidential residence on the barrels of machine guns, 18 of which he used to create columns.\n“I am not a shooter. I don’t own guns. I don’t shoot for hobby or hunt or and I was never in the military. I’ve always been the social commentary artist,” Farrow said of his relationship to his medium of choice. Under Trump’s second presidency, restrictions on who can buy a gun, including those who have active arrest warrants, have eased.\nHis first works featuring gun parts were inspired by Catholic reliquaries, containers for relics that were sometimes fashioned into the form of body parts to store remains of saints during the Middle Ages. \nFrom 1999 until earlier this year, it was illegal to purchase more than one firearm a month in California, per state law, but that prohibition was struck down in June of this year after a challenge from a pro-gun organization. When asked how he procured gun parts on a large scale, Farrow said he obtained them “a variety of ways,” and left it there.\n\nDetailed side-view shot of “White House”\nOriginally, his model of the White House was painted black, but Farrow decided to chemically rust the model to make it appear “corroded.”\n“And that rust, for me, is symbolic of the corrosion, the degeneration of the presidency in our system,” Farrow said.\nFarrow, who is in his mid-80s, said he has never seen this level of fear of artistic censorship in his decades-long career.\n“This is above and beyond anything that’s come before. We’re really facing a steep decline,” Farrow said. “I’m really thinking that it might be a really long time until things get back to good.”\nFarrow still spends six days a week working on his art, but has shifted his focus away from architecture. He finished a sculpture of a violin this week, based on Violins of Hope, a musical project that collects instruments owned by Jewish people before and during World War II. Farrow’s version comprises four handguns, and the neck of the instrument is a double-barreled shotgun in a critique comparing Israel’s actions in Gaza with the Holocaust.\n“I’m very aware that I don’t have that many years left,” Farrow said. “I’m just allowing myself total freedom to make anything that I’m looking at. My piles and piles of guns and gun parts and stuff.”\n\nA door comprised of gun parts\n\nFarrow said he intentionally chemically rusted the house to symbolize corrosion of demogracy.\n\nThe columns on the White House replica are made from machine gun barrels.\t",

    "body": "\nIn an ArtNews report from September, Daniel Cassady asks if art market writers are getting it wrong, arguing that the market is not as distressed as reported ad nauseam. He quotes Kenny Schachter, who suggests that the data is skewed; some noteworthy gallery closures in New York City do not represent a market that is doing just fine. Cassady points out that all these articles of doom and gloom may be feeding the downturn.\nThe lead market writers for Artnet News and ArtNews have been thorough and accurate, but they are looking at only a restricted subset of data, as I will explain. In fact, the market is far worse. \nI started collecting art in my early 20s in medical school, buying by working weekend jobs and taking out loans. There were no art databases, nothing to check auction history. I overpaid substantially for our first contemporary purchase — Kenneth Noland’s “Shift” (1966). The third purchase my wife, Livia, and I made was Ellsworth Kelly’s “Chatham VIII” (1971), which required a three-year bank loan. How was I to understand the reasoning behind its price when we were the only buyers of the 14 new Chatham works? How did galleries determine prices? I set out to learn this and the intricacies of auctions: hidden reserves, chandelier bids, guarantees, authenticity, and iffy condition reports.  \nLivia and I were offered Donald Judd’s first stacks, standing at 10 feet (~3 meters) high. The issue was price — swinging $12,000 while living in a med school dorm; a new artist at the time with a price equivalent to over $250,000 today.\nThe ’70s saw a lethargic market and in 1981, as though a spark was lit, the art market began a long, steep ascent. It became international with 10 times as many collectors by the end of the decade. Galleries proliferated, the East Village was a vibrant scene, and Soho was the epicenter. Prices soared. When a young artist was included in the Whitney Biennial, prices might have tripled. Works in 1989 were selling for $100,000 to $200,000 by artists with thin resumes. It was a seller’s market. \n\nEllsworth Kelly, “Chatham VIII” (1971), oil on canvas (image courtesy Marc Straus Gallery)\nThen, in 1990, the market completely crashed. It started with the withdrawal of all Japanese collectors at once, and the tinder was Japan’s financial crisis, paired with a vastly overpriced market and speculation. At Sotheby’s in 1991, there was not a single bid on the 13 lots that came up before the one I hoped to get at a bargain. By 1995, the market slowly became energized and rose episodically until 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed and everything stopped for about nine months, with many job losses in galleries and then a market reset about 40% lower. The market progressively rose until May 2022, when the malaise set in and gradually intensified.\nWhat are the causes of this current decline? \n\nIrrational speculation pre- and post-COVID as never before, as evidenced by Asian collectors buying untested young American works that, in some cases, went from $30,000 to over $1 million in just three years. \nThe Chinese real estate crisis, with a devaluation of perhaps $60 trillion and a tightening of moving money offshore.\nPost-COVID money spent on works never seen, listening to poor advice and algorithms that don’t have heartbeats nor an eye for quality. \nPrimary market prices were often too high to sustain such a downturn. It was the equivalent of an all-time high price/earnings ratio.\nAuction houses soon struggled and adapted to offer easier online buying and made many more online sales.\n\nQuality consignments are increasingly more difficult to realize in a down market. Auction houses strive for high throughput rates, selling over 90% of works offered. To achieve that, they have forced estimates often below half the primary market, promising that by starting at a “bargain,” there would be more bidding and better results. But in fact, for most recent auctions, average prices were nearer low estimates — meaning far below retail. And that has fueled distrust in primary prices.\nAuction houses have increasingly made sales in which many of the works have no reserves. Take the important Mallin Collection at Sotheby’s — toward the final iterations of sales in 2024 and 2025, scores of works could be had at $1. And many did sell for less than the cost of the paint. The optics of such sales are devastating.\nAuctions charge around 27% commissions, which in a down market make consignors far more resistant. \nWhen auction prices of newer high-flyers started collapsing, the bottom fell out. Some artists’ prices dropped from $1.8 million to $30,000. Almost no one was going to chase the newest high-flyer. Those who bought into the speculation became jaded and most withdrew. \nNo longer were galleries protecting secondary sales. Auction guarantees and chandelier bids camouflaged the weakness. \n\n\nArtsy has a huge presence now. It’s a marketplace with tens of thousands of works for sale. It is part of the democratization of art sales, and also at this moment plays a role in the downturn. For many artists, there are simply too many works being offered for sale. It diminishes many important conversations between the gallery and buyer. \nArt fairs — there are far too many and, yes, they are very expensive. Fewer American collectors went to Basel this past June than in previous years. \n\nOne very prominent collector who has averaged buying some 300 works a year recently told me that she is going to wait this out; prices had become senseless. \nThis declining market is worsened by a doubling and tripling of art shipping costs and higher rents, especially in NYC. Spaces on Grand Street, where my gallery has our flagship location, can cost as much as $200 per square foot. The worst of this is not the closure of Blum in July. It is some 60 mostly younger galleries that went under in the past three and a half years that almost no one has written about. Just look at the gallery maps of the Lower East Side in 2020 compared to now.\nWhat art market analysts are writing is factually true, but the data are not fully representative. Gallery sales are almost always private, and only a small percentage truthfully reveal their sales and profits. Where it’s public, as with the eminent Sadie Coles gallery in London, we see examples of over 50% sales drops. Average gallery sales are reported to be down 8 or 10%. That would hardly have caused closures. It is far, far worse. \nReports at art fairs trumpet the triumphs. Auction data tell us that the total sales of contemporary art are down 15% and then 27%. Sales of the highest-priced works are said to be down far more. A half-year report from September says the average price of a work at auction is down 7%. But these reports hardly address the selection of works and quality. Auction houses focus on what they think will sell. They turn down many pieces, and in a slow market, they are offered less good work. Auctions are taking many fewer sculptures because more buying is online, and appreciating a 3D work through a screen is challenging. Lately, there is much more abstraction and much less Black figuration. They try to find the trends, and as a result, so many artists with reasonable auction prices four years ago are not accepted for auction now in the belief that they won’t sell. Thus, we aren’t seeing much of the large market declines because works are rejected. Furthermore, to have an artwork accepted by a lead auction house for the May or November New York day sales, they want to realize a minimum, often $25,000.\n\nMarie Watt, “Skywalker/Skyscraper (Portrait)” (202), Livia Straus family blankets, I-beam, cedar (image courtesy Marc Straus)\nOne well-known barometer of the art market is the Mei Moses Art Index acquired by Sotheby’s, quoted by many as authoritative. It is a database of over 30,000 artworks that have sold at least twice at auction, establishing a time interval and two prices. It is tremendously valuable, but consider that only a small percentage of artworks come to auction, a minuscule percentage come up twice, and those that do are often more desirable. \nWe love to blame the auction houses. They are businesses driven by profit. They don’t represent artists and need not have fealty to them. They cut the best deals that they can for themselves. When markets soar, obtaining consignments of good works at acceptable reserves becomes easier. Who wants to sell at a bad time and when pushed to low reserves? \nThe gallery business is the worst model for a business that I have ever known. I ran both small and very large medical practices; not easy in our complicated insurance environment but doable. A gallery, on the other hand, is a seasonal business. They may sell little or nothing at expensive fairs. Rent is up. Foot traffic is down. A downturn such as this one is truly difficult for this industry. It has only one product: Art.\nAs with every downturn, there will be a correction, and this one is imminent. A sustained slowdown like this engenders necessary changes. It is a market truism that galleries can never lower prices. But they can, carefully and reasonably. It’s happening. After all, auction sales go to the highest bidder. \nThe speculators are nearly gone. Galleries are promoting lower-priced works, readjusting some prices. Artists are more attentive to the new market realities. A leveling off is occurring. The disposition of estates cannot easily legally be put off, and sooner or later, several major estates will come to auction. \nIn the wake of this week’s auctions, with capacity crowds again at night sales, there was a great sense of relief and some optimism. The Pauline Karpidas sale did very well earlier this fall. The Robert F. and Patricia G. Ross Weis, Leonard Lauder, and Cindy and Jay Pritzker Collections just sold and boldly make the case that quality rules. A-plus works often broke records, and the Lauder sale buoyed the Sotheby’s sale that followed. Hundreds of works offered of lesser quality either didn’t sell or sold for low prices. For the most part, there was little recovery of prices for artists whose market had been battered. But it was a truly good week.\nAs curator Alex Feim noted recently, a whole bunch of new galleries are opening. The Armory Show this September was packed with people. One can feel hesitancy but also renewed enthusiasm. The newer collectors are learning the value of looking in person, of feeling the thrill of seeing an artwork they fall in love with, of the back-and-forth repartee with gallerists. More seasoned collectors are coming back in. \nI just bought a fabulous sculpture from a gallery that for years had a hard rule that it didn’t offer discounts. Apparently, that changed. I purchased a painting by a newish artist from another gallery offering it at a very reasonable price. Signs of a healthier market.\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tEarlier this month, Sasha Suda, the former director and CEO of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, filed a civil suit against the institution, alleging wrongful termination, unfair treatment, and abuse. On Thursday, the museum filed its response.\n\n\tIn a new motion to compel arbitration, the museum denied Suda’s claims and asserted that the 12-member Executive Committee voted unanimously to terminate her for cause following “an extensive investigation.” That investigation, the motion states, concluded that Suda had “misappropriated funds from the Museum and lied to cover up her theft.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe filing further claims that Suda “repeatedly asked the Compensation Committee” for raises above her agreed-upon $720,000 annual salary and, after being denied, “awarded herself the salary increase the Committee had just declined,” allegedly doing so on three separate occasions without informing the board. In September, according to the motion, the committee discovered these increases, prompting the formation of a special board committee to investigate, assisted by outside counsel.\n\n\t“After reviewing the evidence and evaluating their fiduciary duties to the Museum, the Executive Committee determined that the evidence overwhelmingly established that Suda violated her Agreement by misappropriating Museum funds and engaging in repeated acts of dishonesty,” the motion states.\n\n\tThe museum’s motion also contends that Suda’s employment contract requires all claims to be resolved through “private, confidential arbitration.” An employment agreement attached to the filing includes that clause. Suda’s complaint argues that she is entitled to litigate in court under the “injunctive relief” exception in the agreement. The museum denies the applicability of that exception.\n\n\tIn an emailed statement, the museum confirmed it had filed the petition but declined further comment.\n\n\tLuke Nikas, a lawyer for Suda, told ARTnews via email that the museum’s allegations are false. “These are the same recycled allegations from the sham investigation that the Museum manufactured as a pretext for Suda’s wrongful termination,” he wrote.\n\n\t“The motion, as well as its false narrative, fits the Philadelphia Museum’s longstanding pattern of trying to cover up its misconduct and mistreatment of staff,” Nikas continued. “We expected the Museum would prefer to hide the sordid details about its unlawful treatment of Sasha Suda in a confidential arbitration. If the Museum had nothing to hide, it would not be afraid to litigate in state court where we filed the case.”\n\n\n\tSuda joined the museum in 2022 after serving as director and CEO of the National Gallery of Canada. Her tenure there was described as “marked by controversy” by Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. Shortly after taking the post in 2019, Suda led what the newspaper called a “wholesale reimagining” of the institution aimed at correcting “historical wrongs.” The Globe and Mail estimated that 30 to 40 staff members, including several senior leaders, left the museum under her leadership.\n\n\tAt the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Suda also faced challenges. The museum had recently weathered a scandal involving then director Timothy Rub, who was accused of mishandling sexual harassment complaints. When Suda arrived, the museum was in the midst of a long and acrimonious negotiation with unionized workers, who began striking shortly after her tenure began.\n",

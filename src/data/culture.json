(photo via Wikimedia Commons, CC0 1.0 Universal)\n    \n        \n            A controversial monument to \"victims of communism\" in downtown Ottawa will no longer include the names of specific people after the Canadian government reportedly discovered potential Nazi affiliations among the commemorated individuals. The memorial, \"Canada, a Land of Refuge,\" originally proposed under conservative former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, was inaugurated last December by the government of Canada and Tribute to Liberty, an organization formed to build a monument honoring those \"affected by communism.\" Over 500 specific names were reportedly expected to be engraved on the memorial within a year of its unveiling, though Jewish groups and historians raised concerns for years that over half of the individuals could have been Nazi collaborators in the Holocaust. The monument's unveiling was delayed amid the controversy. This week, one year after the memorial's unveiling, the Department of Canadian Heritage said that it no longer planned to etch specific names into the memorial.“The Government of Canada has emphasized that all aspects of the Memorial to the Victims of Communism must align with Canadian values of democracy and human rights,” Caroline Czajkowski, a spokesperson for the Department of Canadian Heritage, told Hyperallergic in a statement. “The Wall of Remembrance will now solely feature thematic content that conveys the broader commemorative and educational intent of the Memorial.” When Hyperallergic asked Tribute to Liberty about reports that Nazi connections were discovered among the commemorated, the organization provided a statement alleging that \"Kremlin-aligned activists and commentators in Canada have relentlessly spread disinformation targeting Central and Eastern European diaspora communities.\"The monument comprises 4,000 metal rods designed by Paul Raff Studio, a central element of the memorial called the “Arc of Memory,” and is \"intended to express the vastness of people who suffered under communist regimes,\" according to the Department of Canadian Heritage.According to government records obtained by the Ottawa Citizen under freedom of information laws, the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a local Holocaust education organization, warned the Canadian government in 2021 that one individual whose name was to be included, Ukrainian nationalist Roman Shukhevych, was connected to the killings of Jews. Some names had already been engraved on the monument, including that of Janis Niedra, who was reportedly connected to a massacre of 350 Jews in Latvia. These names had been reportedly previously removed from the monument. Hyperallergic has contacted Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        ",

(photo courtesy NEA)\n    \n        \n            Political consultant Mary Anne Carter, who served as the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) during the first Trump administration, will lead the agency again following Senate approval this week. Carter's appointment comes almost a year after Maria Rosario Jackson, a former Biden-appointed chair of the agency, stepped down from the post one day after Trump was inaugurated for a second term. Jackson was the first African American and the first Mexican-American person to lead the federal arts agency. In the 11 months since Jackson stepped down, the NEA rescinded arts grants en masse, notifying awardees that their projects were cancelled as the agency refocused on promoting “skilled trade jobs,” “AI competency,” “support [for] the military and veterans.” The NEA also terminated a longstanding grant program, Challenge America, that was geared toward \"underserved communities.\" Senior officials within the NEA resigned in May amid the cuts. Trump had also threatened to eliminate the agency entirely in a budget proposal earlier this year. In September, the American Civil Liberties Union won a lawsuit it filed against the NEA for asking applicants to abstain from funding anything that could be considered to be \"gender ideology,\" as defined by the Trump administration.After Carter's first appointment in 2018, reporters pointed out that she had served on Trump's presidential inaugural committee. A public LinkedIn account also notes that she served as director for Republican Rick Scott's transition to governor in 2011, later becoming his office's chief policy advisor. Her LinkedIn also includes experiences as a radio talk show host and campaign strategist. Notably, in the 1990s, she worked for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, which helped shape Trump's Project 2025 far-right policy agenda. \"The arts are essential to creating, innovating, healing, and recovery, and they provide vital economic stability to communities across the nation,\" Carter said in a press release. \"I look forward to the many celebrations that will take place in 2026 in honor of America’s 250th anniversary, as well as to the agency’s continued research into the powerful role the arts play in healing—from illness to trauma to natural disasters.” There is no indication that Carter has any specific experience working in fields related to arts and culture, aside from her previous tenure at the NEA. When Jackson was appointed in 2021, she served as a tenured professor at Arizona State University’s Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts. Carter was first nominated to lead the NEA in May, but was not officially approved by the Senate until yesterday, December 18. Her approval comes as the board of the Kennedy Center for the Arts, which is chaired by Trump, voted to rename the Washington, DC, organization the “Trump-Kennedy Center.” Trump’s name was affixed to the center’s facade this morning. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

(Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n    \n        \n            Dear Mayor-Elect Mamdani and members of the Arts & Culture Transition Team:As you remake New York into a better home for all those forgotten by the politics of our city, a place where working people and immigrants truly feel the power that belongs in their hands, remember this: Arts and culture are the very vehicles through which we express the power to shape our destinies. We must ensure that every member of our communities can actively participate in artistic and cultural creation and access affordable, local arts programs.Tragically, artists in all disciplines (be it visual arts, dance, film, music, theater, or writing) who are recognized and fairly compensated for their work increasingly come from rich and privileged backgrounds, as the leisure time and resources to learn and practice the arts become scarce or unavailable to working-class people. For that reason, the cultural sector, and working-class artists and cultural workers in particular, will benefit from the core transformations you are proposing: rent freezes, free buses, and universal childcare. We in the arts and culture sector must recognize that what you are proposing is cultural policy and support you in it, rather than asking for special affordability carve-outs for artists that end up pitting them against their own communities.Yet we also need you to enact a bold vision for the role of city government in fostering the arts and helping communities thrive by uplifting their cultures. This vision must start with the understanding that the arts are a public good on the same level as education, healthcare, housing, transportation, and public safety. As a democratic socialist, you already understand the importance of generous public sector support for core public goods to ensure universal access and equity.Global Mashup: Celebrate Mexico! Linda EPO Meets Mariachi Tapatio de Alvaro Paulino performance at Flushing Town Hall on November 1, 2025 (all photos by and courtesy Gus Philippas)Through that lens, the current glaring inequities in public funding for the arts, reflected in the budget of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), must be addressed urgently, rather than swept under the rug as previous administrations have done. This has never been more urgently needed, as highlighted in the Center for an Urban Future’s latest report, Creative New York 2025. If a neighborhood in central Brooklyn or southeast Queens lacks the same quality of schools as neighborhoods on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, or the same access to transportation or quality hospitals, these injustices must be recognized and repaired. The same is true of arts and culture; some neighborhoods receive generous public support, while others get scraps.We must start by saying — shouting! — that DCLA gives more funding annually to the Metropolitan Museum of Art than it does to every cultural institution in Queens and Staten Island combined. The per-capita DCLA funding in Manhattan is 10 times the per-capita funding in Queens and 5 times the per-capita funding in Brooklyn, and that 80% of the DCLA’s budget goes to 39 organizations, while 20% goes to the remaining 1,000 funded organizations in the city.For many years, the larger members of the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG) — 39 cultural institutions on city-owned land that receive direct operating and energy support from the city, including The Met, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center — have silenced this conversation in sector-wide cultural advocacy. Some of these institutions have misinterpreted the many calls for funding equity as an attack on their funding.Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Public funding for The Met — $25 million or so annually, reflecting approximately 10% of the DCLA budget — is a shining example of the ways that public support for cultural institutions can go toward addressing the well-being of entire communities and neighborhoods; their funding shouldn’t be cut, it should be replicated in every city council district. To say that The Met alone shouldn’t receive 10% of the DCLA budget, or that the American Museum of Natural History shouldn’t receive 8% of it, is not to say that their funding should be cut. It is to say that the DCLA budget must be massively expanded so that these types of investments in the public good can be available to all New Yorkers.The Metropolitan Museum of Art (photo by Shinya Suzuki via Flickr, image CC BY-ND 2.0)Cities such as Paris and London spend billions on arts and culture, while New York City only allocates a mere quarter of one percent of its annual budget to it — approximately $250 million. That this pittance makes DCLA the largest arts funder in the United States is not something for New Yorkers to be proud of. It is something for Americans to be embarrassed by. If you want to make New York a bold model for other cities, I urge you to make a plan to rectify this in your first 100 days in office.For years, countless voices have called for DCLA’s budget to be increased to one percent of the City’s total budget. This would be a modest investment in a sector that brings an eight-fold return on public funding in economic activity and provides a wide range of public and community goods. That modest investment could easily rectify the inequities mentioned above, while preserving much-needed support for large institutions like the Brooklyn Museum or the New York Botanical Garden. One percent of the budget could mean over $20 million in every city council district, which would be a game-changer for New York’s poorest and most underserved neighborhoods.Yet many funders, including the DCLA, have massive blind spots and a narrow view of how arts funding should be distributed: The priority is always for them to give funding to well-established 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations with “capacity” to manage that funding. With that restriction in mind, there do not appear to be enough eligible cultural organizations in Queens or Staten Island or certain neighborhoods of Brooklyn or the Bronx to receive the types of funding increases I’m talking about — yet it is stable funding that generates capacity in the first place. Significant new investments in underfunded neighborhoods could, yes, go to existing small and mid-sized cultural organizations, giving them massive increases in capacity — but they could also go to unincorporated arts organizations, collectives, small businesses, and, most importantly, to individual artists. HueArts and other advocacy organizations like it have called for arts funding to go to these types of non-traditional grantees as a way to ensure greater equity in the sector. The model of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, which is the core of the mainstream White arts sector, is not always a good fit for communities of color. A necessary policy change to generate true cultural equity is to radically expand the types of recipients who can receive public funding.Relatedly, another important policy change is to shift most of DCLA’s grantmaking through the Cultural Development Fund (CDF) from project-based grants to baselined general operating support. Project-based grants may seem flashier on the surface, but they place significant burdens on grantees by systematically underfunding the true costs of the everyday realities and labor of administering projects. As a result, small organizations and individual artists often rely on uncompensated labor to carry out their projects; mid-sized organizations struggle to raise enough operating support to subsidize these costs, and even larger organizations can get themselves into significant debt by taking on too great a volume of contracts that allow for only 10%, 15%, or 20% overhead, when the true costs are at least 25% to 35% or more.Furthermore, the constant changes in CDF funding for small organizations that result from the vicissitudes of annual grant panels cause great harm. These organizations are not able to plan effectively if they don’t know what their funding will be in the next year, and when they are zeroed out, they usually have to eliminate or significantly reduce important programs that serve the public. Dance/NYC and A.R.T./New York have carried out CDF impact surveys over the last three years that have demonstrated these harms; and Flushing Town Hall (of which I am the deputy director), through its cultural mapping of Queens, has found that these systemic issues with annual applications and project support prevent small organizations from thriving and growing. That, in turn, continues to prevent under-resourced communities from having the same access to cultural resources that wealthier communities enjoy.The New York Arabic Chorus and Toshi Reagon performing at Flushing Town Hall as part of the Songs of the Living series, October 30, 2025, with author Sami Abu Shumays playing violin in the top right cornerIf the Cultural Development Fund is to be true to its name, it must be completely reimagined. The good news is that the longstanding CIG model demonstrates the benefits of baselined general operating support for organizations — and it would be simple to replicate this model for the other organizations currently in the CDF portfolio. Doing so would save significant money and labor time for both grantees as well as DCLA itself by eliminating the need for them to write and read thousands of cumbersome grant applications on an annual basis. This is a no-brainer and would be transformative for art and culture workers, especially if done in conjunction with other significant new investments in under-resourced communities described above.All of these changes, though, must begin with a detailed acknowledgment of the present state of DCLA funding. Despite pledges initially made by Former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, DCLA’s data is still not fully transparent and public. Reporting on the city’s Open Data website is late and incomplete, and there is no tracking of the most important metrics we need to see to ensure that the DCLA makes progress toward delivering more equitable funding to the city: namely, its funding distributions by geography, by organization size and type, by discipline, and by communities served. During the prior two mayoral administrations, DCLA continued to claim that it was making moves toward equity, while failing to publish the data to back it up and cherry-picking anecdotal successes to tell a story at odds with the broader funding trends. We need you, Mr. Mamdani, to publicly commit to making DCLA’s funding distributions fully transparent, public, and comprehensible to everyone.The three reforms proposed above — funding transparency, an overhaul of the CDF grantmaking process, and significant budget increases to create citywide funding equity — would ensure that our cultural sector is able to thrive and serve our communities. I echo the calls made by the LatinX Arts Consortium of New York and the Cultural Equity Coalition of New York (both of whose steering committees I am on), whose letters to the previous administration garnered the support of hundreds of organizations in our sector. I want to emphasize that what arts and culture needs is not more public-private partnerships — the neoliberal model that has made our sector a pawn of real estate and other industries — but greater public support and funding. By creating special housing and workspaces for artists or community spaces for organizations, developers have been empowered to build more unaffordable units and price out existing residents from many neighborhoods. The arts sector has unfortunately been complicit in the gentrification of our own city over the last several decades, falling under the category of “artwashing,” but we New Yorkers deserve better.All of the problems that these public-private partnerships claim to address, especially the lack of space and affordability, could be solved more effectively by public action. Many city-owned properties have been kept off the market, which has the effect of artificially inflating the value of the housing stock for developers, as Former Comptroller Scott Stringer identified as early as 2016. Through a combination of activating these city-owned properties, enacting proven solutions to homelessness, and following through on your own proposals for controlling the rising cost of living, you could radically alter the fabric of our city in ways that would benefit all New Yorkers. These efforts would have a much greater effect on artists and the arts sector at large than any market-based solutions. The People’s Cultural Plan, which I helped to draft, addressed all these issues in 2017: Housing reform, cultural funding equity, and fair wages for artists and cultural workers must all be tackled intersectionally to enable our sector to thrive.Mr. Mamdani, by combining housing affordability reforms with these proposed DCLA changes, you have the potential to bring new life to our vibrant arts and culture sector, the indisputable backbone of our city. Thank you for considering making these important reforms a reality for the benefit of all New Yorkers.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Zohran Mamdani\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe British Museum is sending some of its prized art and artifacts on long-term loan to countries that the British Empire previously colonized. While those nations have long called for the repatriation of objects they consider stolen, the institution may be hoping to blunt some of those criticisms by sending valuable historical items—though not always those that come from the recipients of the loans. \n\n\tA Mumbai museum, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS), is now host to a loan of some 80 artifacts, including an ancient wooden model of an Egyptian riverboat and devotional Sumerian statues from 2200 BCE, as well as a Roman mosaic from London and a marble bust of Roman emperor Augustus, the Telegraph reports, noting that it is the largest ever loan of ancient material to India and the first deal of its kind between the British Museum and a non-Western museum.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“You don’t have to embarrass your own country to do something positive with another country,” British Museum director Nicholas Cullinan told the Telegraph. “It can actually be very beneficial. Cultural diplomacy, that’s what museums should do.”\n\n\tThe artifacts are on view in a gallery that disputes “colonial misinterpretation” by highlighting India’s contributions to civilization, says the paper.\n\n\t“All cultures are great cultures and we need to respect all cultures,” said Sabyasachi Mukherjee, director general of the CSMVS museum. “Through this exhibition, there is decolonisation, an attempt is made to decolonise the narrative. We suffered for many years and colonisation penetrated into our education, our culture. There is a kind of emergence. I’m going to use the word ‘revolt’, but we are emerging with dignity and are very proud of history.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya or Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, the main museum in Bombay (Mumbai), India, 1972.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHarvey Meston/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe British Museum holds many contested artworks, including a number of bronze sculptures from the African kingdom of Benin, known as the Benin Bronzes, and the Parthenon Marbles (formerly known as the Elgin Marbles), from Athens. The British Museum Act of 1963 forbids the institution from turning over such contested items, though talks have long been underway between British and Greek authorities about a possible loan of the marbles. The museum also previously lent some looted Asante artworks to a museum show in Ghana.\n\t\n\n\tOne notorious example of misappropriated treasures from India’s colonial era is the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which originated in the Kollur mine in current-day Andhra Pradesh, India, and now part of the Crown Jewels. (The diamond is currently set in Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and is housed in the Tower of London, along with the rest of the Crown Jewels; it is not owned by the British Museum.) It was surrendered to Queen Victoria when she was crowned Empress of India. India, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have all demanded its return. \n\n\tThe British Museum also holds the Amaravati Marbles, which come from the Great Shrine of Amaravati, built around 200 BCE, also in Andhra Pradesh, one of the largest and most important Buddhist monuments in ancient India.\n\n\tMany museums throughout the West have made an effort in recent years to return looted artifacts to their countries of origin, including examples from India. Cullinan’s proposal explores a different route.\n\n\t“There is another model, a much more positive one of collaboration rather than this kind of zero-sum, binary, all-or-nothing model that people put forward,” Cullinan told the Telegraph. “We think that this model that we are developing is a very positive one, and is very innovative. Every case is different, you can never apply the same criteria to two different cultures, countries or territories. Some are more difficult than others. But we’re still trying.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tArnulf Rainer, the Austrian artist whose relentless drive for experimentation made him a key figure of Europe’s postwar scene, died on December 18 at 96 at his home in Austria. His death was confirmed by his gallery Thaddaeus Ropac.\n\n\tBorn in Baden, Austria, in 1929, Rainer spent more than seven decades searching for new modes of expression, producing a body of abstract work that is most closely associated with the Art Informel movement. \n\n\tHe is best known for his Übermalungen (“overpaintings”), a technique he began in 1952 in which he layered dense strokes of pigment over existing images—at first his own images, and, from 1953 onward, those of other artists such as Italian painter Emilio Vedova. Rainer’s resulting works, seemingly at once destructive and devotional, turned painting into a site of erasure, accumulation, and spiritual immersion. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“The organic act of creating is perhaps more essential than the completed painting,” he once said, likening the process to a contemplative ritual.\n\n\tAcross the 1950s and ’60s, Rainer turned his painterly attention to the body and self. His “blind drawings,” as well as the “Face Farces” and “Body Poses” series featured overpainted photographic self-portraits whose gestural marks complicated the artist’s presentation of his own psyche. Though not a Viennese Actionist, he exerted a catalytic influence on the movement’s early years.\n\n\tRainer’s engagement with postwar trauma also shaped his work. His 1951 photographic portfolio “Perspectives of Destruction” listed the catastrophic losses of the recent past—Hiroshima, the Holocaust, war and wreckage—and his subsequent layers of black, matte, and glossy paint became what art historian Helmut Friedel described as a “painterly skin in which history is safely stored.” Rainer later adapted this approach to enlarged photo-booth self-portraits, attacking the surface with paint applied by hand, producing hybrid images that fused representation with abstraction.\n\n\tBy the late 1960s and ’70s, major institutions had begun to recognize his importance. He received an early survey in 1968 at the Museum des 20. Jahrhunderts (now called Mumok) in Austria; participated in the 1972, 1977, and 1982 editions of Documenta in Kassel, Germany; and gained international prominence after exhibitions at Kunsthalle Bern and the Lenbachhaus Munich in 1977. \n\t\n\n\tHe represented Austria at the 1978 Venice Biennale, the same year he received the Grand Austrian State Prize. In the 1980s, he continued to have major exhibitions at the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Centre Pompidou in Paris, Abbazia di San Gregorio in Venice, and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. He also taught at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna from 1981 to 1995.\n\n\tHis work is included in dozens of major museum collections in Germany, Austria, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US. In 2009, the Arnulf Rainer Museum opened in Baden, which celebrated his 95th birthday with a monographic exhibition in 2024.\n\n\t“An artist makes the past his own and adds something new,” art historian Rudi H. Fuchs once wrote of the artist whom he included in Documenta 7. Rainer’s dealer Thaddaeus Ropac, who worked with the artist for more than four decades, called him “a true innovator,” adding: “He never stopped pushing the boundaries of what art could be and how it could be created.”\n\n\tArt critic Donald Kuspit perhaps put it best: in Rainer’s hands, gesture regained not only its raw energy but its “significance as an indicator of inner mystery.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert Mnuchin, the Wall Street pioneer who became one of New York’s most respected art dealers and a fixture at blue-chip auctions, died on Friday at his home in Bridgewater, Connecticut. He was 92. His death, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by his stepdaughter, Lisa Hedley Wick. \n\n\tMnuchin was unusual in having two long and highly successful careers. At Goldman Sachs, he was a central figure in the rise of block trading in the 1960s and ’70s, helping build the firm’s institutional equities business under managing partner Gustave Levy. By 1978, the Wall Street Journal described him as “the acknowledged dean of block traders,” rivaled only by Salomon Brothers’ Michael Bloomberg. His skill on the trading floor—an encyclopedic recall of buyers and sellers, an instinct for pressure and timing—made him a legend inside the firm. He became a partner in 1967, co-headed trading and arbitrage by 1976, and joined the firm’s powerful management committee in 1980. He retired in 1990. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThat same set of instincts—competitive, analytic, and deeply interpersonal—animated his second act. After decades on Wall Street, Mnuchin did something that surprised even close friends: he left finance to open a gallery. It was not a move financiers of his stature typically made. As he later told ARTnews, it “took a lot of courage” to step away from the Goldman machine and test whether his success came from his own abilities or the institution behind him. “I wanted to see what I could do on my own,” he recalled. And because no museum would hire someone without a formal art background, “the only alternative was to start my own gallery, which is what I did.” \n\n\tHe and his wife, Adriana, converted part of their East 78th Street townhouse into C&M Arts (partnering with James Corcoran) in 1992, later partnering, with Dominique Levy in L&M Arts. He would establish Mnuchin Gallery, on his own, in 2013. From the start, the gallery had a clear identity: rigorous, museum-quality exhibitions focusing on the pillars of postwar American art—Pollock, Rothko, Kline, de Kooning—as well as major presentations of Alexander Calder, Donald Judd, Jeff Koons, Frank Stella, Philip Guston, Sam Gilliam, Ed Clark, and David Hammons. He staged eight exhibitions devoted to Willem de Kooning alone, calling the artist “Picasso-esque” for the breadth of his distinct periods. \n\t\n\n\tMnuchin’s passion for exhibitions—and his conviction that art should be lived with—shaped both his gallery and his own collecting. “The reason to buy art is because you love it, you love it, you love it,” he told the New York Times in 2013. He disliked the term “collection,” insisting that he and his wife kept everything they bought in their home, never in storage. \n\n\tHe became equally known for his presence in the auction room. At evening sales, he was a calm but relentless bidder—sometimes shouting out prices or jumping ahead in increments to secure a work. In 2019, wearing a cream-colored jacket and armed with a flip phone, he set a record for a living artist when he placed the winning $91.1 million bid for Jeff Koons’s Rabbit (1986), acting on behalf of an anonymous client widely believed to be hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen. His bidding style—patient, unshowy, decisive—made him a recognizable figure even for those who didn’t know his long résumé. \n\n\tThough he was the father of Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, Robert Mnuchin largely avoided politics and was described by colleagues as modest, disciplined, and deeply devoted to art. Friends and art-world peers often noted his integrity: Amy Cappellazzo, the former Sotheby’s chairman, once called him “one of the straightest shooters in the business.” \n\t\n\n\tRobert Elliott Mnuchin was born on September 5, 1933, in Manhattan. His father, Leon A. Mnuchin, was a lawyer and longtime director at several retail companies. The family collected works by Franz Kline and Mark Rothko—and, as he liked to note, once owned a forged Matisse. He grew up on Central Park West before the family moved to Scarsdale. He attended Scarsdale High School, graduated from Yale in 1955, and served briefly in the Army before joining Goldman Sachs. \n\n\tMnuchin married Elaine Terner in 1957; they had two sons, Steven and Alan. After their divorce, he married Adriana Graber, with whom he had a daughter, Valerie. In addition to his wife, daughter, and sons, he is survived by his stepchildren Lisa Hedley Wick and Bradley Abelow. \n\n\tMnuchin worked well into his later years, even as he faced mobility challenges. He skipped Art Basel in Basel for the first time in two decades in 2019, but continued to remain at the gallery’s exhibitions and for major sales. “I love what I do,” he said in the 2021 ARTnews interview. “I’d be lost without it.” \n",

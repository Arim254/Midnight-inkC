    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tJanuary 15th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nThink back, if you will, to the works of art you cre­at­ed at age twelve or thir­teen. For many, per­haps most of us, our out­put at that stage of ado­les­cence amount­ed to direc­tion­less doo­dles, chaot­ic comics, and a few unsteady-at-best school projects. But then, most of us did­n’t grow up to be Michelan­ge­lo. In the late four­teen-eight­ies, when that tow­er­ing Renais­sance artist was still what we would now call a “tween,” he paint­ed The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny, a depic­tion of the tit­u­lar reli­gious fig­ure beset by demons in the desert. Though based on a wide­ly known engrav­ing, it nev­er­the­less shows evi­dence of rapid­ly advanc­ing tech­nique, inspi­ra­tion, and even cre­ativ­i­ty — espe­cial­ly when placed under the infrared scan­ner.\nFor about half a mil­len­ni­um, The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny was­n’t thought to have been paint­ed by Michelan­ge­lo. As explained in the video from Inspi­rag­gio just below, when the paint­ing sold at Sothe­by’s in 2008, the buy­er took it to the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Muse­um of Art for exam­i­na­tion and clean­ing.\n“Beneath the lay­ers of dirt accu­mu­lat­ed over the cen­turies,” says the nar­ra­tor, “a very par­tic­u­lar col­or palette appeared. “The tones, the blends, the way the human fig­ure was treat­ed: all of it began to resem­ble the style Michelan­ge­lo would use years lat­er in none oth­er than the Sis­tine Chapel.” Infrared reflec­tog­ra­phy sub­se­quent­ly turned up pen­ti­men­ti, or cor­rec­tion marks, a com­mon indi­ca­tion that “a paint­ing is not a copy, but an orig­i­nal work cre­at­ed with artis­tic free­dom.”\n\n\n\t\n\nIt was the Kim­bell Art Muse­um in Fort Worth, Texas that first bet big on the prove­nance of The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny. Its new­ly hired direc­tor pur­chased the paint­ing after turn­ing up “not a sin­gle con­vinc­ing argu­ment against the attri­bu­tion.” Thus acquired, it became “the only paint­ing by Michelan­ge­lo locat­ed any­where in the Amer­i­c­as, and also just one of four easel paint­ings attrib­uted to him through­out his entire career,” dur­ing most of which he dis­par­aged oil paint­ing itself. About a decade lat­er, and after fur­ther analy­sis, the art his­to­ri­an Gior­gio Bon­san­ti put his con­sid­er­able author­i­ty behind a defin­i­tive con­fir­ma­tion that it is indeed the work of the young Michelan­ge­lo. There remain doubters, of course, and even the noto­ri­ous­ly uncom­pro­mis­ing artist him­self may have con­sid­ered it an imma­ture work unwor­thy of his name.

    "body": "\n\tin Life, Music |   \tJanuary 14th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nImag­ine, if you will, tak­ing a seat at the piano before a full house of 2,000 music lovers ready to hear Mozart’s Piano Con­cer­to No. 20 in D minor — and, more impor­tant­ly, on stage with an orches­tra and con­duc­tor more than ready to play it. That would be dif­fi­cult enough, but now imag­ine that you thought you were sup­posed to play the Piano Con­cer­to No.23 in A major, anoth­er piece of music entire­ly. This is the stuff of night­mares, and indeed, the very sit­u­a­tion in which pianist Maria João Pires found her­self in 2013, after she’d been recruit­ed to fill in for anoth­er play­er at an open rehearsal held at Ams­ter­dam’s Con­cert­ge­bouw. You can watch it unfold, assum­ing you can bear it, in the clip above.\nAs Pires says in the Clas­sic FM inter­view below, it had been “per­haps 11 months” since she’d last played the piece into which she could hear the orches­tra launch­ing, “and that’s the moment where you start los­ing the mem­o­ry of the details. That’s how the mem­o­ry func­tions, you know. And when peo­ple see this pan­ic, they per­haps don’t know that the real­i­ty is, we lose our mem­o­ries after just a cou­ple of months.”\nIt seems to have been the encour­age­ment of con­duc­tor Ric­car­do Chail­ly that got her through the moment of pan­ic and into a cred­itable per­for­mance. “You know it so well!” he insist­ed to her, and indeed, as he remem­bered lat­er, “The mir­a­cle is that she has such a mem­o­ry that she could, with­in a minute, switch to a new con­cer­to with­out mak­ing one mis­take.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe eleventh-hour call Pires received ask­ing her to take the gig was part of the prob­lem, but so was a mis­heard num­ber. Accord­ing to the Köchel cat­a­logue, which orga­nizes all of Mozart’s work, the Piano Con­cer­to No. 20 in D minor is 466, where­as the Piano Con­cer­to No. 23 in A major is 488. Whether Pires mis­heard the K‑number or the caller mis­spoke, she soon found her­self faced with a musi­cal chal­lenge for which she felt com­plete­ly unpre­pared. In fact, she was­n’t: as Chail­ly knew, or at least banked on, her career as a clas­si­cal pianist up to that point had giv­en her all the expe­ri­ence she need­ed to draw upon to over­come the cri­sis. As her recov­ery reminds us, pro­fes­sion­al­ism isn’t so much about mak­ing sure that things always go right as being able to han­dle it when they go wrong. It hap­pens that Pires has gone through this par­tic­u­lar kind of mix-up three times, which makes her a con­sum­mate pro­fes­sion­al indeed.\nvia MyMod­ern­Met\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Kei­th Jar­rett Played on a Bro­ken Piano & Turned a Poten­tial­ly Dis­as­trous Con­cert Into the Best-Sell­ing Piano Album of All Time (1975)\nWatch the First Per­for­mance of a Mozart Com­po­si­tion That Had Been Lost for Cen­turies\nHear the Exper­i­men­tal Piano Jazz Album by Come­di­an H.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nIn our expe­ri­ence, bird lovers fall into two gen­er­al cat­e­gories:\nKeen­ly obser­vant cat­a­loguers like John James Audubon …\nAnd those of us who can­not resist assign­ing anthro­po­mor­phic per­son­al­i­ties and behav­iors to the 435 stars of Audubon’s The Birds of Amer­i­ca, a stun­ning col­lec­tion of prints from life-size water­col­ors he pro­duced between 1827 and 1838.\nOur sus­pi­cions have lit­tle to do with biol­o­gy, but rather, a cer­tain zesti­ness of expres­sion, an overem­phat­ic beak, a droll gleam in the eye.\nThe Audubon Society’s new­ly redesigned web­site abounds with trea­sure for those in either camp:\nFree high res down­loads of all 435 plates.\nMp3s of each specimen’s call.\nAnd vin­tage com­men­tary that effec­tive­ly splits the dif­fer­ence between sci­ence and the unin­ten­tion­al­ly humor­ous locu­tions of anoth­er age.\n\nTake for instance, the Bur­row­ing Owl, as described by self-taught nat­u­ral­ist Thomas Say (1787–1834):\nIt is delight­ful, dur­ing fine weath­er, to see these live­ly lit­tle crea­tures sport­ing about the entrance of their bur­rows, which are always kept in the neat­est repair, and are often inhab­it­ed by sev­er­al indi­vid­u­als. When alarmed, they imme­di­ate­ly take refuge in their sub­ter­ranean cham­bers; or, if the dread­ed dan­ger be not imme­di­ate­ly impend­ing, they stand near the brink of the entrance, brave­ly bark­ing and flour­ish­ing their tails, or else sit erect to recon­noitre the move­ments of the ene­my.\nThe notes of ornithol­o­gist John Kirk Townsend (1809 – 1851) sug­gest that not every­one was as tak­en with the species as Say (who was, in all fair­ness, the father of Amer­i­can ento­mol­o­gy):\nNoth­ing can be more unpleas­ant than the bag­ging of this species, on account of the fleas with which their plumage swarms, and which in all prob­a­bil­i­ty have been left in the bur­row by the Bad­ger or Mar­mot, at the time it was aban­doned by these ani­mals. I know of no oth­er bird infest­ed by that kind of ver­min. \n\nThe Com­mon Gallinule, above, sug­gests that there’s often more to these birds than meets the eye. His some­what sheep­ish look­ing coun­te­nance belies the red hot love life Audubon recounts:\n… the man­i­fes­ta­tions of their ama­to­ry propen­si­ty were quite remark­able. The male birds court­ed the females, both on the land and on the water; they fre­quent­ly spread out their tail like a fan, and moved round each oth­er, emit­ting a mur­mur­ing sound for some sec­onds. The female would after­wards walk to the water’s edge, stand in the water up to her breast, and receive the caress­es of the male, who imme­di­ate­ly after would strut on the water before her, jerk­ing with rapid­i­ty his spread tail for awhile, after which they would both resume their ordi­nary occu­pa­tions.\n\nBeing that we are firm­ly plant­ed in the sec­ond type of bird lover’s camp, this ornitho­log­i­cal cor­nu­copia main­ly serves to whet our appetite for more Falseknees, self-described bird nerd Joshua Barkman’s beau­ti­ful­ly ren­dered web­com­ic.\nYes, Audubon’s Indi­go Bird, aka Petit Pape­bleu, “an active and live­ly lit­tle fel­low” who “pos­sess­es much ele­gance in his shape, and also a cer­tain degree of firm­ness in his make” was sep­a­rat­ed by a cen­tu­ry or so from “Mood Indi­go”—we pre­sume that’s the tune stuck in Barkman’s bird’s head—but he does look rather pre­oc­cu­pied, no?\nPos­si­bly just think­ing of meal­worms…\nExplore Audubon’s Birds of Amer­i­ca by chrono­log­i­cal or alpha­bet­i­cal order, or by state, and down­load them all for free here.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nCor­nell Launch­es Archive of 150,000 Bird Calls and Ani­mal Sounds, with Record­ings Going Back to 1929\nA Lav­ish­ly Illus­trat­ed Cat­a­log of All Hum­ming­bird Species Known in the 19th Cen­tu­ry Gets Restored & Put Online\nWhat Kind of Bird Is That?: A Free App From Cor­nell Will Give You the Answer\nExplore an Inter­ac­tive Ver­sion of The Wall of Birds, a 2,500 Square-Foot Mur­al That Doc­u­ments the Evo­lu­tion of Birds Over 375 Mil­lion Years\nThe Bird Library: A Library Built Espe­cial­ly for Our Fine Feath­ered Friends\nAyun Hal­l­i­day is an author, illus­tra­tor, and the­ater mak­er in NYC.\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen a 65-year-old tree succumbed to a fungus known as oak wilt, Steve Parker wanted to pay tribute. The wooded habitat had previously loomed above Parker’s front yard and provided refuge to migratory birds. Rather than turn its limbs and trunk into mulch, though, Parker did as he often does with a material that’s no longer primed for its original purpose: he created a sound sculpture.\nRecently on view at Ivester Contemporary in Austin, “Funeral for a Tree” is a sprawling and poetic ode to the oak. Parker cut slices from the trunk that he then carved like vinyl, encoding bird song into the grain. When placed on a Victrola-style turntable, the records play the avian soundscapes.\n\n\n\nTo accompany these dirges, Parker also constructed a suspended brass and copper sculpture with tubing that splays like roots, some of which display blue-bag ventilators at their tips. These medical devices appear alongside CPAP machines in another installation of bark-clad limbs and vintage instruments known as shengs sourced from a Taipei flea market. \nEmphasizing breath and the rhythmic pulse of life, these additions also reference the artist’s late father. “The project emerged from Parker’s recognition that his grief for the tree echoed the loss of his father to cancer—both slow, inevitable declines where care could not prevent loss,” a statement says.\nWatch “Funeral for a Tree” in the video above, and find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Practically overnight, he became a local legend, and he inspired a unique sense of neighborly support that people still talk about in Barry.\nWelsh filmmaker Isaac Atkin-Mayne, who grew up in Barry and heard much about Canty over the years, was inspired to tell a story of community, camaraderie, and the extraordinary things that ordinary people are capable of in the face of adversity.\n\n\n\nAtkin-Mayne describes his short documentary, “Rick on the Roof,” as a glimpse inside of Canty’s “resolute and bit mad protest, but it’s also about a search for a kind of community that can feel rare today.” He especially responded to the notion of “strangers who are willing to support you through your struggle and make it their own, and 20 years later, remember those days as the most meaningful of their lives.”\nThe collaborative project includes archival footage captured by a local named Steven Toozer, who had initially planned to make a short film about Canty’s protest. Along with additional footage from news sources and other individuals, Atkin-Mayne adds a further dimension by including interviews with those who knew Canty personally. “This is a homegrown film about collective memory, retracing Rick’s story through the voices of those closest to him as a kind of visualised oral history,” Atkin-Mayne says.\nReleased amid the ongoing cost-of-living crisis in the U.K., “Rick on the Roof” delves into a story of how a quiet neighborhood rallied around an individual facing a truly unique set of circumstances. Neighbors sent food and essentials up to him via a bucket-and-pulley system, and even though the house was sold at auction in the summer of 2007, he continued to stay on the roof until he was forced off in late 2008.\n“Barry, like much of the U.K., is facing a stark rising cost of living that’s quietly affecting people in many different ways,” Atkin-Mayne says. “Our goal in remembering Rick’s story is to to renew a sense of togetherness through hardship and remind ourselves that we’re never alone.”\nRick Canty and his mother in front of their home in Barry, Wales\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom figures with multiple legs and noodles for arms to frolicking trees, Paco Pomet summons the absurd. Known for his uncanny oil paintings rendered mostly in monochrome and enlivened by colorful details of overly stretchy limbs or celestial objects, a sense of nostalgia greets surreal scenarios. The artist often derives his imagery from vintage black-and-white photographs, adding an absurd dimension to history.\nPomet’s work is currently on view in a solo exhibition titled Planet Circus at Richard Heller Gallery, which continues through February 14 in Santa Monica.

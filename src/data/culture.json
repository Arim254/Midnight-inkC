    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetail of Moses Ros, “Echoes of Nature” (2025), acrylic on canvas\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nBorn in New York City in 1958, the Bruce Museum’s 2025 artist-in-residence, Moses Ros, has always found that nature offers inspiration for his art. In HUMAN / NATURE — produced in response to the exhibition Blanche Lazzell: Becoming an American Modernist (Bruce Museum, February 6–April 27, 2025) — Ros marshals color and its absence to call attention to issues around environmental loss. Like Lazzell, whose white-line woodcuts fracture the world into chromatic planes separated by contours of exposed white paper, Ros divides his compositions into a series of amorphous, interlocking forms. Across his paintings, mobiles, and sculptures, this brilliantly colored, camouflage-like pattern is punctuated by cut-outs of recognizable wildlife, making further reference to Lazzell’s signature white-line approach.\nWhile the luminous hues that pervade the show at the Bruce Museum communicate Ros’s joyous appreciation of nature, they also act as a secondary form of camouflage, obscuring the darker realities that underlie his work. Developed in the service of war and hunting, camouflage mimics and manipulates the appearance of the landscape to conceal the destructive forces lying in wait. As a result of these and other human interventions, the species Ros depicts here — the passenger pigeon, dodo bird, and the regal fritillary butterfly, among others — are either endangered or already extinct. By positioning viewers within an immersive environment of the artist’s making, this exhibition seeks to celebrate nature’s beauty while also revealing humanity’s irrevocable impact on the natural world.\nAbout the ArtistMoses Ros is a sculptor, painter, and printmaker of Dominican descent who lives and works in New York City. He creates artworks to lift the human spirit, using bright colors, dynamic shapes, and interactive elements. Ros has had solo exhibitions at the Sugar Hill Museum, the Bronx Museum of the Arts, and the Yeshiva University Museum in New York, as well as the Paterson Museum in New Jersey. He has also exhibited in the Yoryi Morel Gallery of the Institute of Culture and Art in Santiago, Dominican Republic.\nRos has received several public sculpture commissions from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, the Bronx Council on the Arts, and the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority. His artwork is part of public and corporate collections, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, El Museo del Barrio, and the AT&T Collection.\nTo learn more, visit brucemuseum.org.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

(image courtesy CajaGranada Fundación)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA miniature gouache painting by Pablo Picasso has gone missing in Spain, according to CajaGranada Fundación, a cultural center and museum in Granada. \nIn a statement shared with Hyperallergic, the institution said that its staff discovered that Picasso’s “Naturaleza muerta con guitarra (Still life with a guitar)” (1919) was missing from a shipment of items for an upcoming exhibition. The painting, about the size of an iPhone SE at 5 by 3.9 inches (12.7 by 9.8 centimeters), had been expected by the museum from a private collection for its exhibition Bodegón: La eternidad de lo inerte (Still Life: The Eternity of the Inert), which opened on October 9.\nHowever, when unpacking a delivery of works for the exhibition originating from Madrid on October 6, just three days before the exhibition’s opening, the institution said its curator and exhibition manager discovered that the Picasso painting, reportedly worth €600,000 (~$700,500), was not among the items.\nA delivery company, the institution said, had arrived days earlier on October 3, and the packages sat over that weekend under video surveillance, which showed no disruption. The statement did not name the company.\nAt 10 am on October 3, the museum said its staff met a van carrying the works and instructed them to bring them inside in a single forklift transfer. The works were then moved from the van to a freight elevator into an area with video surveillance. According to the museum, the packages arrived improperly numbered, so a thorough check of the works was impossible without unpacking everything. Before the delivery employees left an hour and a half later, the museum said staff checked the provenance information on the packages, but did not verify the works physically before dismissing the individuals who delivered the packages.\nThe Spanish newspaper El País reported that two individuals were on board the van and stopped overnight not far from Granada. Nobody has been arrested yet, according to the El País, and police are focused on determining at what point during the journey the work disappeared. It is unclear if the painting was initially confirmed to have been on the delivery van.\nIn its statement, CajaGranada Fundación said that it filed a report with Spain’s national police and will cooperate in the investigation. Hyperallergic has not yet heard back from the Policía Nacional.\nPicasso’s work has long been targeted by thieves, including in a 2012 heist at a Dutch museum in which “Tête d’Arlequin” (1971) was swiped. In 2019, a French court found that the Spanish artist’s electrician and his wife had stolen 271 Picasso paintings and kept them hidden in their garage for 40 years. \n“We have filed a report of the disappearance with the National Police; we have made all our resources available for the investigation, fully confident that the proceedings will proceed smoothly and resolve the case,” the museum said in its statement.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nIssy Wood’s “Charli 2” (2025), commissioned by Vanity Fair as the cover for the upcoming art issue publishing this November. Wood’s portrait both references and complements Aidan Zamiri’s photos of Charli XCX for the singer’s October cover story with the magazine. (image courtesy Issy Wood/Vanity Fair)\n“I don’t really get to decide when [brat]’s over or not,” Charli XCX told Contributing Editor Anna Peele during an extended interview for Vanity Fair‘s cover story this month — “I think that’s up to the world.” If VF has a say, brat (2024) and the career evolution it has imposed on the singer and producer are still relevant over a year later, especially since the magazine commissioned contemporary artist Issy Wood for a portrait of the British pop star for the cover of its first art issue in 20 years publishing this November.\nThough Charli is intentionally absent from the award-winning album’s iconic, retina-singing green and blurry text cover art, Wood brings her front and center again in a simultaneously fuzzy and edgy oil portrait on equally shocking orange velvet. Depicting Charli from her cupid’s bow to the crown of her head, the painter captures the arched brows and hooded eyes of the party princess’s lethal stare piercing from beneath her buoyant waves. \nFor the portrait, the American-born British painter told VF that she drew from “the length and quality of [Charli’s] career prior to the global success of brat, the throwaway candor of her lyrics, [and] the Britishness we both share.” But not without adding her own flourishes of yellow twinkles and sweeping white lines that loop and bounce across the singer’s face, elements that walk the line between a fun Instagram face filter and doodles on the margins of one’s ruled notebook and push a surreal intimacy throughout the painting.\nWood’s portrait both references and complements Aidan Zamiri’s photos of Charli XCX for the singer’s October cover story with the magazine.\n\nIssy Wood, “Charli 2” (2025) (© Issy Wood 2025;  photo by Damian Griffiths, courtesy the artist, Carlos/Ishikawa, London, and Michael Werner Gallery)\nWood, who also produces her own music in addition to her established visual arts practice, appears to understand at its core what Charli XCX means when she pronounces that “Everything is Romantic.” Perhaps not necessarily through “bad tattoos on leather-tanned skin,” as the singer emphasizes on the track, but in other similarly quotidian yet captivating sights and scenes: canker sores and tightened braces, rippling back muscles and shiny challah bread, car interiors and shiny revolvers.\nHer paintings, some of which are currently on view through January in a solo show at Schinkel Pavilion in Berlin, flutter between alluring and unsettling as they tap into forgettable moments and sensations, buried desires or suppressed fears, and curiosity beyond one’s control.\nWood noted to the magazine that it was a challenge to capture one of the most famous faces of the 2020s compared to the nature of her own practice, but accepted any labels of the work reading as fan art because that is “one of the purest and most tender art forms we have.” \nLike Wood, Charli herself is markedly expressing interest in new artistic endeavors, from establishing herself and the fans who attended her impromptu album remix concert at Storm King Art Center last year as “fine art bitches now” to going on to star in forthcoming films.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetail of work by Ruth Asawa in Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective (all photos Lisa Yin Zhang/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nI’ve been thinking about Ruth Asawa’s shadows. They’re surprising, not shaped how you might expect: While one of her sinuous hanging basket sculptures might be elongated, with an oblong head and abdominal segments, for instance, its shadow might have a round belly and a shortened neck — another character entirely. Shadows aren’t an afterthought in Asawa’s work, but another dimension of it — another way in which one thing can contain or serialize into an infinity. What plenitude; what a rich, generous world. \nThe Museum of Modern Art’s edition of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective solves the problems critic Alex Paik raised in his excellent review of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s version. Whereas that show downplayed racism in her life, the main exhibition text here points to the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in camps as an uprooting injustice; it explicitly states that Asawa was denied an art teaching degree due to anti-Japanese prejudice. Whereas Paik found the SFMoMA show crowded, this one felt like an aquarium of light and space. Its floor plan is continuous — you can walk around either side of every wall, and there’s never a wrong choice, always another chance to loop back around, as if you were tracing the paths of one of her loping wires. You’ll move from a room about her experiments with nature into another dedicated to her tireless advocacy for arts education — something else Paik wanted from this exhibition — and then continue on in the first room, the experience all the richer for the detour. This is such a wonderful and well-curated show that it gifted this perpetually skeptical critic the freedom to let my thoughts and feelings and pleasure bloom and wilt, fold into one another, as if I were one of Asawa’s lovely vessels. \nIn fact, we are part of Asawa’s artistic germination from the very first room, dedicated to the time she spent in her early 20s at Black Mountain College, in the late 1940s. In an untitled oil and watercolor on paper inspired by autumn leaves, bulbous forms that anticipate the silhouette of her later sculptures overlap gently, as if nuzzling. The thin support buckles under the weight of the pigment, as if struggling to hold the full measure of Asawa’s vision. Nearby, the oil-on-masonite “Figures on Green” (c. 1947–48) contains eight rounded figures with arms held aloft in various states of elongation and compression, as if they’re leaping off the surface. A couple of years later, she found the dimension she was searching for, with paperfold works that zigzag dizzyingly on the wall. \n\nRuth Asawa, Untitled (S.691, Wall-Mounted Paperfold with Horizontal Stripes) (1951), ink on paper\nThere’s one shaped like a giant seed, the folded paper and pod alike a labyrinth of intricacy and possibility. Or should I say that it is a seed pod, for Asawa’s works aren’t metaphorical, allusive, concerned with their own cleverness. They don’t stand in for other things, they become their own versions of them. It feels, for instance, as if the real-life stripes of a watermelon and the flow of ink through paper in a 1960s work depicting one were guided by one and the same hand.\nI love that the curators took the time to carve that same pleated-paper pattern into one wall and chose to suspend a vitrine there containing patents, newspaper clippings, and magazine spreads by and about the artist. It suggested to me that all the walls of the exhibition might fold into each other, that no aspect of her work exists apart from another, nor even any facet of her life.\n\nInstallation view of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective\nInstallation view of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective\nAsawa’s basket sculptures seem to make that continuity between all things tangible. Figuring out how they come into being twists the mind into a Gordian knot, turning the simple task of following a plane into the experience of traversing a Möbius strip: exterior becomes interior becomes exterior again. Each work toggles between all manner of forms — anthropomorphic figures and alien creatures, deep-sea invertebrates and uteruses — at once, and yet somehow they’re always more. One has a raindrop-shaped head and tail, like a continuous chain of fluid moments suspended in time, where the beginning is also the end. Another evokes stacked witches’ hats or wormholes, child’s play and the very fabric of time-space at once. They sway or spin so slowly that they seem cosmically removed from you, like a planet that turns once in your lifetime. And yet you’re an integral part of that very system — it’s your steps, your breath, that propels them. \nLater in life, Asawa’s sculptures became fractal, exploding outward rather than tending inward, each branch end begetting ever more. Are they roots or tendrils, beginnings or ends? As always, both, and then some. I raised my arms to take a picture and, looking at my own shadow, saw myself as one of those ecstatic leaping figures from that very first gallery, as if I had been spun off the tip of one of her dandelion sculptures and sent out into the world as both messenger and message, the infinite seed of her vision contained within me. \n\nInstallation view of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective\nInstallation view of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective\nInstallation view of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective\nInstallation view of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective\nInstallation view of Ruth Asawa: A Retrospective\nRuth Asawa: A Retrospective opens at the Museum of Modern Art (11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, Manhattan) on October 19 and continues through February 7, 2026. \n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tPemberton Asset Management, a European private credit manager, has acquired Bonhams from the private equity firm Epiris for an undisclosed sum.\n\n\tIn an email sent by Hans-Kristian Hoejsgaard, the chairman of Bonhams’s board, to staff and seen by ARTnews, he wrote: “Today marks the start of a new chapter for Bonhams. Pemberton Asset Management, one of our existing lenders and a leading investor backed by Legal & General, the UK’s largest insurance company, has taken ownership of the business from Epiris.”\n\n\tHoejsgaard added that the move has also seen Bonhams’s global CEO, Chabi Nouri, depart her role, along with its chief commercial officer, Céline Assimon. Both were based in London. Swiss-born Nouri was appointed in August last year after stints as CEO of Richemont-owned watch and jewelry company Piaget, and more recently as a private equity partner at the Mirabaud Group. Bonhams hired Assimon in May 2023.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tAlex Lejeune, Bonhams’s CFO and COO, will remain until the end of the year to “support the transition.”“I will continue as chairman and am pleased to welcome a new senior leadership team, with Seth Johnson joining as CEO, Liese Thomas as CFO, and Jennifer Babington as COO,” Hoejsgaard wrote. “Chris Ellerker and Mohit Agarwal from Pemberton will be joining the board, replacing Owen Wilson and Zoe Lai from Epiris.”\n\n\tIn 2023, Epiris floated Bonhams’s sale and reportedly approached JPMorgan Chase & Co. to advise on the deal. Epiris was seeking $1 billion for the 232-year-old auction house (its total revenue topped $1 billion in 2022), but the sale process fell through.Epiris acquired Bonhams in 2018 and oversaw a phase of significant growth. During that time, it added several smaller regional auction houses to its portfolio, including the Nordic firm Bukowskis, New England–based Skinner, and Danish house Rasmussen. In June 2022, Epiris further expanded Bonhams’s reach by acquiring the French auction house Cornette de Saint Cyr. The move brought Bonhams’s total number of salerooms worldwide to 14, with locations including Hong Kong, Los Angeles, and, most recently, Paris, where it launched operations last year.In the wake of these acquisitions, Bonhams’s then-CEO Bruno Vinciguerra told The Art Newspaper in 2022: “[Bonhams’s sale] will happen one day, but this is not what drives our strategy. I’m personally convinced we’re going to work on this for 20 years, as a company; it’s a long-term thing.”\n\n\tIn an email to ARTnews on Sunday, a Bonhams spokesperson—writing “across Pemberton and Bonhams’ press offices”—declined to disclose how much Pemberton had paid for the acquisition. “Epiris’s investment cycle came to an end [so] it became clear that a new owner would be best placed to support the business through its next phase,” they wrote. “Pemberton, as a result of its experience with its portfolio companies in sectors and regions of high relevance to Bonhams and their work in repositioning iconic brands, is better placed to support the ongoing transition and long-term ambitions of Bonhams.”“This transaction marks a defining moment for the business, eliminating the debt overhang and bringing balance-sheet strength and strategic flexibility,” they added.\n\n\tThe email also included a statement from Hoejsgaard: “Bonhams has achieved significant growth and sustained profitability over recent years, and we thank our former owners Epiris for their role during this time. Despite a challenging market, Bonhams’s resilient performance relative to the wider sector has been supported by investments in technology, the expansion of our global footprint, and being strategically positioned in the premium auction space and a leader in the mid-market. This is all underpinned by our broad 60-plus-department offer, which meets the needs of a diverse client profile. The partnership with Pemberton and the new leadership team strengthens our market position and supports our long-term growth ambitions.”\n\n\tEpiris did not respond to ARTnews’s request for comment by the time of publication.\n\n",

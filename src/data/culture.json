    "body": "\n\tin Education, Math |   \tJanuary 7th, 2026  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWilliam Gib­son famous­ly observed that the future is already here, it’s just not even­ly dis­trib­uted. That line is often thought to have been inspired by Japan, which was already pro­ject­ing a thor­ough­ly futur­is­tic image, at least in pop­u­lar cul­ture, by the time he made his debut with Neu­ro­mancer in 1984. But as any­one who’s spent enough time in the coun­try under­stands — albeit not with­out frus­tra­tion — even twen­ty-first-cen­tu­ry Japan remains in many ways a pre-dig­i­tal soci­ety. Many busi­ness­es only take cash, more than a few ser­vices require com­mu­ni­ca­tion by fax, and there’s no sub­sti­tute for a phys­i­cal han­ko seal on impor­tant doc­u­ments. Even so, it may come as a sur­prise to learn that Japan still uses aba­cus­es.\nOr rather, Japan still uses aba­cus­es as edu­ca­tion­al tools: you won’t see many shop­keep­ers pull them out while ring­ing up your pur­chas­es, but if you glance in the win­dow of the right kind of pri­vate acad­e­my, you might well see young stu­dents furi­ous­ly per­form­ing cal­cu­la­tions the very old-fash­ioned way.\nIf they’re suf­fi­cient­ly advanced, as explained in the BBC video above, they won’t even have actu­al aba­cus­es; they’ll just move around beads pic­tured in their heads. (It brings to mind how Dustin Hoff­man’s savant in Rain Man explains his per­for­mance of seem­ing­ly impos­si­ble men­tal math: “I see it.”) Such inten­sive aba­cus edu­ca­tion was com­mon across north­east Asia in the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, when the arith­metic skills it cul­ti­vat­ed were impor­tant for both indi­vid­ual sur­vival and nation­al devel­op­ment.\nIt was that very devel­op­ment that tend­ed to push the aba­cus into obso­les­cence. When Korea, where I live, could afford elec­tron­ic cal­cu­la­tors, the pres­tige asso­ci­at­ed with aba­cus mas­tery dis­solved prac­ti­cal­ly overnight. Deter­mined Kore­an par­ents can still sign their chil­dren up for jupan class­es, much as Chi­nese par­ents might encour­age theirs to enter into suan­pan com­pe­ti­tions out of a sense of civ­i­liza­tion­al pride, but they have noth­ing like the sta­tus the soroban enjoys in Japan. That may be vin­di­cat­ed by neu­ro­sci­en­tif­ic research point­ing toward the ben­e­fits learn­ing the aba­cus can have on a devel­op­ing brain’s cog­ni­tive func­tions. As the BBC video explains, aba­cus train­ing enhances cog­ni­tive func­tion by sharp­en­ing con­cen­tra­tion, accel­er­at­ing infor­ma­tion pro­cess­ing, and strength­en­ing visu­al mem­o­ry, lead­ing to improved mem­o­ry and sus­tained focus. But as any enthu­si­ast of Japan­ese craft cul­ture knows, no mat­ter how much hard­er it may be to do things with ana­log tools, some­times it’s just more sat­is­fy­ing.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nFree Online Math Cours­es\nThe Won­der­ful Wood­en Mar­ble Adding Machine\nThe Math­e­mat­ics Behind Origa­mi, the Ancient Japan­ese Art of Paper Fold­ing\nCom­plex Math Made Sim­ple With Engag­ing Ani­ma­tions: Fouri­er Trans­form, Cal­cu­lus, Lin­ear Alge­bra, Neur­al Net­works & More\nJapan­ese Musi­cians Turn Obso­lete Machines Into Musi­cal Instru­ments: Cath­ode Ray Tube TVs, Over­head Pro­jec­tors, Reel-to-Reel Tape Machines & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Design, History, Religion |   \tJanuary 6th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt was long ago that poly­the­ism, as the sto­ry comes down to us, gave way to monothe­ism. Human­i­ty used to have many gods, and now almost every reli­gious believ­er acknowl­edges just one — though which god, exact­ly, does vary. Some pop­u­lar the­o­ries of “big his­to­ry” hold that, as the scale of a soci­ety grows larg­er, the num­ber of deities pro­posed by its faiths gets small­er. In that scheme, it makes sense that the grow­ing Roman Empire would even­tu­al­ly adopt Chris­tian­i­ty, and also that the gods it first inher­it­ed from the city-states of ancient Greece would be so numer­ous. Through our mod­ern eyes, the var­i­ous immor­tals invoked so read­i­ly by the Greeks look less like holy fig­ures than a cast of char­ac­ters in a long-run­ning tele­vi­sion dra­ma.\nOr maybe it would have to be a soap opera, giv­en that most of them belong to one big, often trou­bled clan. Hence the struc­ture of Use­fulCharts’ Greek Mythol­o­gy Fam­i­ly Tree, explained in the video above. Also avail­able for pur­chase in poster form, it clear­ly dia­grams the rela­tion­ships between every­one in the Greek pan­theon, from the high­est “pri­mor­dial gods” like Eros Elder and Gaia down to the chil­dren of Zeus and Posei­don.\nHow­ev­er pow­er­ful they could be — and some were pow­er­ful indeed — none of these gods act­ed like the infal­li­ble, omni­scient enti­ties of the major reli­gions we know today. They could act capri­cious­ly, venge­ful­ly and even non­sen­si­cal­ly, a reflec­tion of the often capricious‑, vengeful‑, and non­sen­si­cal-seem­ing nature of life in the ancient world.\nFor the Greeks them­selves, these myth­i­cal gods and mon­sters offered not just an explana­to­ry mech­a­nism, but also a form of enter­tain­ment, giv­en that noth­ing could go on in their ele­vat­ed world with­out high dra­ma. For us, they remain present in leg­ends from which we still draw inspi­ra­tion for our own larg­er-than-life sto­ries of hero­ism and vil­lainy, but also in our very lan­guage. Con­sid­er the ways in which we con­tin­ue to evoke the likes of the time-rul­ing Chronos, the love-bring­ing Cupid, the androg­y­nous Her­maph­ro­di­tus, or the mul­ti-head­ed Hydra in every­day speech. Though we may no longer need them to orga­nize our soci­eties, some of them have kept play­ing roles in the age of monothe­ism — which, what­ev­er its oth­er advan­tages, does­n’t require us to con­sult dia­grams to know who’s who.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMythos: An Ani­ma­tion Retells Time­less Greek Myths with Abstract Mod­ern Designs\nMythol­o­gy Expert Reviews Depic­tions of Greek & Roman Myths in Pop­u­lar Movies and TV Shows\nHow the Ancient Greeks Built Their Mag­nif­i­cent Tem­ples: The Art of Ancient Engi­neer­ing\n18 Clas­sic Myths Explained with Ani­ma­tion: Pandora’s Box, Sisy­phus & More\nCon­cepts of the Hero in Greek Civ­i­liza­tion (A Free Har­vard Course)\nA Visu­al Time­line of World His­to­ry: Watch the Rise & Fall of Civ­i­liza­tions Over 5,000 Years\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Nature, Photography, Science |   \tJanuary 6th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nAre we tru­ly in the midst of a human-caused sixth mass extinc­tion, an era of “bio­log­i­cal anni­hi­la­tion”? Many sci­en­tists and pop­u­lar sci­ence writ­ers say yes, using terms like “Holocene” or “Anthro­pocene” to describe what fol­lows the Ordovi­cian, Devon­ian, Per­mi­an, Tri­as­sic, and Cre­ta­ceous peri­ods. Peter Bran­nen, the author of extinc­tion his­to­ry The Ends of the Earth has found at least one sci­en­tist who thinks the con­cept is “junk.” But Bran­nen quotes some alarm­ing sta­tis­tics. Chill­ing, even. “Until very recent­ly,” he writes, “all ver­te­brate life on the plan­et was wildlife. But astound­ing­ly, today wildlife accounts for only 3 per­cent of Earth’s land ani­mals; human beings, our live­stock, and our pets take up the remain­ing 97 per­cent of the bio­mass… almost half of the Earth’s land has been con­vert­ed into farm­land.”\n\nThis state of affairs does not bode well for the mil­lions of remain­ing species get­ting edged out of their envi­ron­ments by agribusi­ness and cli­mate change. We learn from extinc­tions past that the plan­et rebounds after unimag­in­able cat­a­stro­phe. Life real­ly does go on, though it may take mil­lions of years to recov­er. But the cur­rent forms of life may dis­ap­pear before their time. If we want to under­stand what is at stake besides our own frag­ile fos­sil-fuel-based civ­i­liza­tions, we need to con­nect to life emo­tion­al­ly as well as intel­lec­tu­al­ly. Short of globe-hop­ping phys­i­cal immer­sion in the Earth’s bio­di­ver­si­ty, we could hard­ly do bet­ter than immers­ing our­selves in the tra­di­tion of nat­u­ral­ist writ­ing, art, and pho­tog­ra­phy that brings the world to us.\n\nThe Bio­di­ver­si­ty Her­itage Library (BHL), an “open access dig­i­tal library for bio­di­ver­si­ty lit­er­a­ture and archives,” has for many years been mak­ing it easy for peo­ple to con­nect to nature through nature writ­ing and illus­tra­tion. On Flickr, you can find 319,000 care­ful­ly curat­ed images. The col­lec­tion itself is sub­di­vid­ed into dif­fer­ent pho­to albums drawn from his­tor­i­cal pub­li­ca­tions. For exam­ple, The Fresh­wa­ter Fish­es of the British Isles (1911), The Bird (1869), and The Insect Book (1901).\n\nThis image archive offers expan­sive views of human­i­ty’s encounter with the nat­ur­al world, not only through sta­tis­tics and aca­d­e­m­ic jar­gon, but through the artis­tic record­ing of won­der, sci­en­tif­ic curios­i­ty, and deep appre­ci­a­tion.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for his meticulous drawings of insects, birds, and other creatures hybridized with mechanical gears and intricate filigree, Steeven Salvat has a penchant for detail. Often tapping into historical analog technology like clocks, typewriters, globes, and hourglasses, the artist nods nostalgically to a pre-digital age.\nSalvat’s forthcoming exhibition, Latitude/Longitude at Galerie Hamon, continues the artist’s interest in the convergence of nature and human activity. This recent body of work, created using acrylic and Chinese ink, focuses more specifically on navigation and cartography. Vintage maps, charts, and globes provide the foundation for beautiful renderings of songbirds and butterflies in a meditation on migration.\n\nIn light of the current climate crisis, migratory patterns of a wide range of creatures—from monarch butterflies to terns to gray whales—are at increased risk of disruption due to shifts in the timing of seasonal changes, habitat destruction, and more extreme weather. Salvat looks to the past as a means of thinking more critically about the inherent beauty and vulnerability of birds. \n“I work on carefully sourced antique maps and navigation objects such as compasses, barometers, and globes, using them as starting points to paint different bird species,” Salvat says. “These works reflect instinctive trajectories and the memory of invisible journeys. Together, they create an immersive space, somewhere between a map room and a contemporary cabinet of curiosities.”\nLatitude/Longitude runs from February 6 to March 4 in Le Havre, France. Find more on the artist’s Instagram and Behance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDutch photographer Pieter Henket has spent the past few years spotlighting the innovative and subversive fashionings of Mexico City’s queer communities. After a lengthy period in the capital, he teamed up with stylist Chino Castilla to create portraits of dancers, performers, and even locals he encountered while strolling through the park. Together, they wanted to highlight “the boundaries between Mexico’s deeply rooted Catholic traditions and the freedom of modern self-expression,” Henket says.\nResulting is a captivating collection that defies notions of cultural identity, gender, sexuality, and even queerness itself. Shot in black and white, Birds of Mexico City zeroes in on the textures of cracked walls and peeling paint lining the weathered space and the particulars of the subjects’ garments. Frilly, lace pleats, a shock of dried foliage, and masks trimmed with fringe both accentuate and obscure the figures’ bodies, while presenting an exuberant aesthetic of contrast.\n“Otokani”\nIn “Fuerza,” for example, a clean-cut muscular figure flexes in leopard-print thigh-highs and heels, a juxtaposition echoed in “Raul,” which features a demure young person revealing soccer attire underneath a corsetted gown. “Chisme” similarly documents a seated figure sporting both a flower crown and a Luchador mask.\nAs corporations co-opt Pride and attempt to position rainbow hues as synonymous with queerness, Henket’s decision to strip the images of color requires the viewer to go beyond a surface-level reading of what it means to express one’s identity. The portraits are also at once expansive and local: they incorporate unusual materials like twigs and gilded frames, yet are deeply rooted in their regional context through accessories like the Luchador masks.\nStriking in composition and message, Birds of Mexico City offers a glimpse into a flourishing community redefining queerness and belonging. The collection, Henket adds, “speaks to freedom, identity, and resilience, revealed through the quiet beauty I found in Mexico City.”\nThe entire series will be released in a monograph this spring from Damiani, and you can pre-order a copy on Bookshop. Until then, explore more of Henket’s work on Instagram.\n“Fuerza”\n“La Familia”\n“Chisme”\n“Raul”\n“Confinamiento”\n“La Mujer”\n‘Birds of Mexico City’\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCombining a variety of fabrics, buttons, shells, and beads, Stephen Towns’ mixed-media textile pieces draw on the rich heritage of quilts made especially by Black women in the American South. Tableaux reminiscent of family portraits and vacation snapshots lend themselves to an exploration of the power of pleasure and community during an era when the South was still racially segregated.\nTowns’ solo exhibition, Safer Waters: Picturing Black Recreation at Midcentury at the Wichita Art Museum, is an extension of the artist’s ongoing series exploring Black leisure in the era of Jim Crow.\n“And it Was Joy That Covered Us” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, and glass beads, 55 x 65 1/2 inches\nLarge-scale compositions sing with vibrant color, portraying families and groups of friends in the midst of dance parties, sunbathing, boating, and swimming at a resort in Florida called Paradise Park. It wasn’t until 1968, with the passing of the Civil Rights Act, that desegregation laws finally negated the need for Black-only businesses and destinations, and Paradise Park, which was advertised “for colored people,” closed in 1969.\nTowns examines the nature of not only relaxation but escape, celebrating the vibrancy of Black joy despite a period of unabashed oppression toward people of color. He emphasizes child-like innocence, togetherness, and leisure as a form of resistance.\nSafer Waters expands his ongoing body of work with the addition of seven new works, shown here. The exhibition continues through June 14, and you can see more by Towns on Instagram.\n“And the Jukebox Played On” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, and rhinestones, 56 1/2 x 67 1/2 inches\n“You are the Meditation of My Heart” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, rhinestones, and metal and glass buttons, 57 1/2 x 69 1/2 inches\n“Until the Flames Burn Out” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, rhinestones,and glass button, 56 x 64 inches\n“All We Knew Was Joy” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, glass beads, and shell, 55 x 65 1/2 inches\n“Luncheon on the Sand” (2025), natural and synthetic fabric, polyester and cotton thread, cubic zirconia, glass beads, and button, 71 1/2 x 59 1/2 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

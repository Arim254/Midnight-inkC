    "body": "\n\n\t\nCoincidence is around every corner, and immortalizing a split second of fleeting chaos takes a special eye. Since 2020, Pure Street Photography—an initiative focused on connecting international photographers—has commended visual storytellers through an annual competition.\nThis year’s edition drew an impressive 1,160 submissions across 34 countries and five continents. Judged by British writer and curator David Campany alongside founder Dimpy Bhalotia, a total of 147 winning and finalist images were chosen. \nChris Yan, “Mirror”\nFrom capturing unfortunately humorous moments before disaster to documenting endearing instances of whimsy, the wide range of winning images evoke a spectrum of expressions. Together, they mirror the distinct emotions one might feel while walking down the street, embodying the authentic spirit of the medium.\nIn a large-scale exhibition at Mumbai’s Jehangir Art Gallery, each winning image will be on view in January 2026.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn a world this absurd and disastrous, do we gravitate toward cynicism or levity? For the artist duo known as Murmure (previously), both are the only option.\nThe Caen, France-based pair presents a new body of paintings and charcoal drawings in their plainly titled exhibition, La fête est finie, or The party is over. Through a unique sense of wit and irony, they transform astronauts into runway models, the moon into a nuclear power plant, and a birthday cake into a raging forest fire. \n“Moon Walk” (2025), carbon pencil on paper, 50 x 40 centimeters\nWhere there could be commonplace sights or moments of joy and frivolity, Murmure instead presents an unsettling composition. Every ill-advised choice—whether baking in front of a UV screen or watching cows graze on an ice floe—becomes a spectacular confrontation with our collective obsessions with consumerism, ecological wreckage, and self-serving gluttony.\nLa fête est finie is on view through November 22 at Galerie LJ in Paris.

Ranging from colorful illustrations that meticulously catalogue differences in categories of food, transit, and appliances, to found object sculptures that form relics of a world understood through touch, the show invites visitors to look, listen, smell, and touch to connect with a diversity of ways of “looking” at the world.\nLOOK HERE features six artists with studio practices based out of CCW – Kelly Brown, Cindy Gosselin, Clyde Henry, Tim Quinn, Brandon Spicer-Crawley, and Allen Yu. Curated by Jennifer Gilbert alongside two CCW artists  — Mary T. Bevlock and Paige Donovan — the exhibition emphasizes art’s ability to communicate across different sensory channels.\nThe show’s design integrates many elements to enhance accessibility for a variety of audiences, including braille, videos about the artists with American Sign Language (ASL) embedded, touch panels featuring artists’ materials, sensory backpacks, an Easy Read guide, a quiet room, and tours led by neurodivergent artists.\nLOOK HERE is complemented by a series of related events, including two satellite exhibitions – one at Haverford’s VCAM gallery, LOOK THERE, featuring a single work from a larger group of 99 CCW artists, and another at Philadelphia’s Atelier Gallery through October, LOOK EVERYWHERE, which highlights works from 33 artists from 30 progressive art studios around the United States. \nThese exhibitions will coincide with the sixth annual Creating Community Symposium, happening October 20–23. Originally founded by California’s Creative Growth Art Center, the symposium brings together professionals from progressive art studios around the US to discuss best practices, advocacy, and the evolving intersection of art and disability. This is the first time the gathering will be held on the East Coast.\nLOOK HERE and LOOK THERE are open through December 13, 2025. LOOK EVERYWHERE closes on October 31.\nTo learn more, visit hav.to/lookhere.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tThe Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art, which closed its brick and mortar New York space in 2024 and now operates as a “global museum,” has named the recipient of its annual art prize, as well as the grantees for its research and art projects.\n\n\tThe winner of the 2025 Rubin Museum Himalayan Art Prize is Khadhok – Tibetan Artists’ Collective. As part of the annual prize, which was established in 2024, recipients receive a $30,000 purse, making it the largest of its kind to support Himalayan artists. Winners are selected on the basis of having made “a mark in creative and critically relevant dialogues between Himalayan art and contemporary life,” according to a release. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tEstablished in 2023, Khadhok is an artist collective based in Dharamshala, India, that offers dedicated space to contemporary visual artists to work on their practices.

This recognition strengthens our confidence and encourages us to keep growing. Most importantly, it changes what is possible for Khadhok, allowing us to build a strong foundation that truly lasts and supports artists and our community for many years to come.”\n\n\tThe Rubin’s 2025 Research and Art Projects grantees were also selected with 15 projects receiving $200,000 total. Also launched in 2024, the grant program supports art and research initiatives that promote the rich cultural legacy and living traditions of the Himalayan regions. The 15 projects were selected from 132 total applications, with grants ranging in cost from $3,000 to $25,000, depending on the scale, impact, and needs of each respective project. The full list of grantees is listed below.\n\n\t“Working with Himalayan art and living artists has been part of our approach since the Rubin was founded in 2004,” Jorrit Britschgi, executive director of the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art, said in a statement. “As a museum without walls we hope to increase visibility and awareness of Tibetan and Himalayan art globally.”\n\n\n\tTogether, the Rubin Art Prize and Rubin Grants will provide $230,000 in direct support to artists and researchers working in connection to the Himalayan region.\n\n\tThe full list of Rubin Art Grantees is as follows:\n\n\tNawang Tsering & Jamyang TenzinTibetan School Art Curriculum: Teaching Resources & Materials for Art Educators$22,000\n\n\tVAST BhutanThe Lungta Art Festival (LAF) 2026$15,000\n\n\tTenzin Tsering (Tenzoni)Threads of Camp Mountain$15,000\n\n\tKhyenleLima Bronze Snow Leopard Art Project – Recycling with Cultural Heritage$18,000\n\n\tWhite Crane Films (Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam)The Earth Is My Witness$12,000\n\n\tHuman Clay Productions CICWeaving the Threads of Bhutanese Heritage$18,500\n\n\tLujan Rai DongolWheel of Life – A Contemporary Reimagining of Samsara$5,000\n\n\tThe full list of Rubin Research Grantees is as follows:\n\n\tStudio Nyandak Documenting and Safeguarding Zanskar’s Buddhist Heritage $25,000\n\n\tTreasure Caretaker TrainingPreservation of Buddhist Art in Mongolia: Research and Training for Painters and Community Members in Charge of Conservation in Remote Areas$20,000\n\n\tLoden FoundationDocumenting Thangkas and Religious Artifacts of Sumtrhang Samdrup Chödzong  $19,500\n\n\tChiara Bellini (with Edoardo Ferrari and Sabrina Ciolfi)Feeding the Fire or Worshipping the Ashes?

    "body": "\n\tEarlier this week, Instagram announced a new awards series called Rings, which is meant to honor creators on the plaform. And the awards have a star-studded list of judges for the inaugural awards, including film director Spike Lee, fashion designer Marc Jacobs, Instagram head Adam Mosseri, and hypebeast incarnate KAWS, aka artist Brian Donnelly.\n\n\tWhile the Meta-owned social media platform has a snazzy website announcing the awards, the company hasn’t revealed much in the way of specifics—like what the categories will be or how people will be nominated. But it did say that winners will receive a physical golden ring designed by fashion designer by Grace Wales Bonner—who is also a judge—as well as a golden ring around their Instagram profile and stories. Winners will be announced next week on October 16.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“We felt that it was time to have an award that recognizes people who take these creative chances on our platform,” Eva Chen, the head of fashion partnerships at Instagram, who helped conceptualize the awards program, told the Hollywood Reporter. “These people are cultural catalysts, and they’re sparking conversations, and by doing that, they encourage people to express themselves as well.”\n\n\tAccording to Chen, the judges worked with Instagram’s creator teams to narrow the field of over 3 billion users to just 25 winners. The winners will span content topics and categories, from fashion to sports, with a wide array of winners.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t“I think that one of the most magical things about Instagram is that it shows every moment of someone’s journey,” Chen said. “For something like this Rings program, we’re rewarding and awarding these creators who have opened up their lives and opened up their art and their vision across all the different surfaces of Instagram.”\n\n\tAs for KAWS, the artist said in an Instagram post that he was “honored to be part of an award that celebrates creators who aren’t afraid to take creative chances and do it their way. Creativity takes many forms – it’s process, perspective, and persistence. Excited to recognize the work that pushes culture forward.”\n\n\tIt’s not the artist’s first time serving as a judge either. In 2011, KAWS served a guest judge on Season 2 of the short-lived Bravo reality series Work of Art: The Next Great Artist, in which artists competed for a solo exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum and a prize of $100,000.\n\n\n\tWinners of Rings, however, seem to be only getting bragging rights—and the gold rings.\n",

    "description": "\n\tTwo leading museum organizations have sharply criticized the Flemish government’s recent decision to transfer the collection and mission of Antwerp’",
    "body": "\n\tTwo leading museum organizations have sharply criticized the Flemish government’s recent decision to transfer the collection and mission of Antwerp’s M HKA to a newly formed museum in Ghent by 2028.\n\n\tIn a “Statement of Support of M HKA,” dated October 10, members of the Museum Watch Committee,  an initiative of CIMAM (International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art), said they were “profoundly concerned by the recent news” and that “[t]his government plan is based upon a false administrative logic that sees collections as merely an assorted accumulation of items.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe letter adds, “That this is happening in Belgium, and especially Antwerp, is unexpected. Over the past 40 years, M HKA has accrued a well-deserved reputation as a European museum of international standing focusing on contemporary art, building on a predecessor founded in 1970. It is known for helping to foster artists’ careers with its first-time-survey exhibitions before these artists become more established and for an extremely multipolar and diverse approach.”\n\n\tIn their letter, the Museum Watch Committee members—which includes Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art director Zeina Arida, Reina Sofia artistic deputy director Amanda de la Garza, and Yu Jin Seng, the National Gallery Singapore’s director for curatorial, research, and exhibitions—called on “the Flemish minister of culture to find an alternative way to take political responsibility for M HKA, to find a new vision that sees and responds to the value in the museum and its location, a vision in which it is not emptied out and turned into a shell merely for the dynamics of the moment. Museum Watch hopes that this exceptional and devastating decision will be undone.”\n\n\tSimilarly, L’internationale, a confederation of European museums and art organizations founded in 2009 and of which M HKA is one of 13 members, also published a statement in support of the Antwerp-based museum. It also called for a reversal of the Flemish government’s decision, writing that its membership is “appalled by the Flemish government’s recent announcement,” which was made “with no consultation with M HKA’s leadership or its stakeholders.”\n\n\tL’internationale also added that it “further object[s] to the lack of transparency and detail so far. How, and on what basis was such a radical redrawing of the Flemish cultural map based – in consultation with whom – and when will this be made known? This plan and the manner of its announcement demonstrate neither openness and accountability, nor the commitment to good governance recently emphasised as central to Flemish cultural policy.”\n\n\n\tIn addition to the transfer of its permanent collection, which is focused on the avant-garde scene of Antwerp and how it connects to the international art world, the building the currently houses M HKA will undergo renovation before becoming an arts center with exhibitions and programming, essentially being transformed into a Kunsthalle. (Last week, the Flemish government also canceled plans for a new building for M HKA that was estimated to cost $151 million.) The CIMAM letter called this change a regression, adding that its concern extends to the fact that “is being separated from its site-specific collection.”\n\n\tThe CIMAM letter continues, “[M HKA] has a major collection anchored in the localized internationality of the post Second World War avant-garde, of which the harbor city of Antwerp was a hotbed of artist activity, and sees this as a strong foundation from which to approach today’s world. Ahead of its time, M HKA was looking towards Eurasia twenty years ago.”\n\n\tThat collection includes works by artists who have lived and worked in and around Antwerp, such as Marcel Broodthaers, Luc Tuymans, Otobong Nkanga, and Laure Prouvost, as well as artists who came to the city to make important work, like Marlene Dumas, Jimmie Durham, Nicola L., and Gordon Matta-Clark, whose Office Baroque (1977) was realized in a five-story building there.  \n\n\tAccording to L’internationale, M HKA’s collection is uniquely contextualized by “the city’s rich artistic lineage within multiple historical, cultural and geopolitical contexts.” The decision to move it out of Antwerp as a way to centralize collections into one institution “is diametrically opposed to L’Internationale’s insistence on fostering plural histories and viewpoints through collections and archives. We fundamentally disagree with the proposition of a single, unified national collection.”\n\n\tIn its letter, L’internationale also expressed concern over “the job security of the institution’s 80 staff” and asked that the “Flemish government to clarify how their new plans are commensurate with maintaining the museum’s current work force.”\n\n\tThe CIMAM letter noted that the M HKA is “one of the two Flemish museums in a federalized country that has been declared a ‘Cultural Heritage Institution’ by its government in recognition of its mission to work at the level of international excellence.” In taking this decision, the Museum Watch Committee believes that this “potentially disastrous decision … will have an unprecedented impact on Antwerp by negating the essential cultural, social, and economic contribution of M HKA to the well-being of the city.”\n\n\tAdditionally, the Museum Watch Committee also pointed to the bona fides of M HKA’s director, Bart De Baere, who is currently the secretary-general of CIMAM and served as chair of the Museum Watch Committee from 2016 to 2024.\n\n\tIn a statement included in the CIMAM letter, De Baere said, “I’m at a loss. We are living in a democracy here, in which we nominate people to take decisions for us. It’s important to take that seriously. I am actively committed to several countries in which people are dying for this very reason. At the same time, I am beyond flabbergasted by both the decision and its hollowness, so I am trying to understand how to navigate between that and democratic logic. At this moment, my colleagues and the artists we serve are my primary concern.”\n\n\tIn its announcement of the decision, the Flemish government said that its new museological strategy, which would see the creation of three museum “clusters” each led by a “beacon” institution, would allow for them to grow “together into museums as described in the new international definition of ICOM.”\n\n\tThe CIMAM letter pointedly refuted this, saying, “This decision also violates the ICOM Museum Definition and its Code of Ethics, to which CIMAM responds and adheres.” That definition, last updated in 2022, defines a museum as “a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage.”\n\n\tThe planned closure of the M HKA and the transfer of its collection has already stirred controversy in the Belgian art scene. After the decision, M HKA’s board chairman Herman De Bode resigned, reportedly saying, “the decision taken by the Flemish government to behead the M HKA, at the suggestion of the Minister of Culture, is too crazy for words. This happened without any participation from anyone on our side. I think that’s criminal. I have no other words for it.”\n\n\tSimilarly, Luc Tuymans reportedly said, “I am angry. We must not forget that the M HKA was the very first museum of contemporary art in Belgium. The whole neighborhood was also built around it. This is a real loss of face for an important city like Antwerp.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Kochi-Muziris Biennial, the largest contemporary art biennial in South Asia, announced the 66 artists from more than 20 countries who will take part in this year’s event. They include Abul Hisham, Aditya Puthur, Adrian Villar Rojas, and Ali Akbar PN.\n\n\tThe exhibition runs from December 12 through March 31 across several venues in the city of Kochi, in the southwest of India, and is titled “For The Time Being.” Among the confirmed venues are Aspinwall House, the central exhibition site (a large sea-facing heritage property in Fort Kochi that was once the headquarters of the trading company Aspinwall & Company Ltd), and Pepper House, a former spice warehouse turned cultural centre on Vembanad Lake.A statement released by the Kochi-Muziris Biennial said this year’s theme will be “oriented around the body, a bearer of memory and materiality, a site of encounter, and a witness to temporality.”“Our invitation to companions was to work with Kochi’s climates, conditions, and resource realities; to make time, think nimbly, and collaborate locally,” the curatorial team said. “Around 50 new commissions are set across many first-time venues in neighbourhoods animated with trade, people, and movement. We draw from the past editions and their lives, and continue to see the exhibition as a growing organism constantly nourished by ideas, emotions, and actions. We also hold space for grief and mourning through this transformative time.”The organizers will be hoping 2025’s edition is more successful than last time out. Two years ago, the biennial was embroiled in controversy after more than half of its participants publicly alleged a breakdown in communication with management and a slew of other problems. Ahead of the show’s opening, one artist pulled out, and several others told ARTnews that they were unable to realize their work before leaving India.Of the 90 artists participating in the 2023 show, 53 signed a letter published by e-flux that spoke of behind-the-scenes chaos. “The scale and ambition of the Biennale should be attuned to its financial situation,” the artists wrote, saying that they had not been paid fees and production costs. They also reported that there were persistent fundraising and labor issues at the biennial.Not only that, but before the 2023 biennial’s opening, both the Art Newspaper and Hyperallergic wrote that the Kerala government reportedly pulled out of a deal to acquire Aspinwall House from a private developer who usually leases the complex for the event. This, along with unexpectedly bad weather, impeded the biennale staff’s ability to prepare the venue for installation. The event ended up being postponed by two weeks due to several scandals.Previous editions of the Kochi-Muziris Biennial have weathered other unfortunate events. In 2019 workers on the 2018 edition said the biennial had not paid them for their labor. During that last edition, Biennale cofounder Riyas Komu stepped down as the foundation’s secretary after allegations of sexual harassment. And in 2011, before the first edition even opened, the Kerala government was asked to investigate the biennial’s financial management.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe artists set to participate this year are: Abul Hisham, Aditya Puthur, Adrian Villar Rojas, Ali Akbar PN, Anja Ibsch and Grüntaler9, Arti Kadam, Athina Koumparouli, Bani Abidi and Anupama Kundoo, Bhasha Chakrabarti, Biraaj Dodiya, Birender Yadav, Cinthia Marcelle, Dhiraj Rabha, Dima Srouji and Piero Tomassoni, Dineo Seshee Bopape, Faiza Hasan, Gieve Patel, Gulammohammed Sheikh, Hicham Berrada, Himanshu Jamod, Hiwa K, Huma Mulji, Ibrahim Mahama, Jayashree Chakravarty, Jompet Kuswidananto, Jyoti Bhatt, Khageswar Rout, Kirtika Kain, Kulpreet Singh, Lakshmi Nivas Collective, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Lionel Wendt, Malu Joy (Sister Roswin CMC), Mandeep Raikhy, Maria Hassabi, Marina Abramović, Mark Prime, Mathew Krishanu, Meenu James, Minam Apang, Mónica de Miranda, Monika Correa, Moonis Ahmad Shah, Naeem Mohaiemen, Nari Ward, Niroj Satpathy, Nityan Unnikrishnan, Otobong Nkanga, Pallavi Paul, Panjeri Artists’ Union, Prabhakar Kamble, Raja Boro, Ratna Gupta, Sabitha Kadannappally, Sandra Mujinga, Sayan Chanda, RB Shajith, Sheba Chhachhi and Janet Price, Shiraz Bayjoo, Smitha Babu, Sujith S.N, Tino Sehgal, Utsa Hazarika, Vinoja Tharmalingam, Yasmin Jahan Nupur, Zarina Muhammed.\n",

(photo by ZUNIS, courtesy Gabrielle Goliath studio)\n    \n        \n            South Africa has withdrawn its participation from the 2026 Venice Biennale following a months-long dispute over an artwork addressing Palestinian grief in Gaza.The move comes after the country's right-wing culture minister Gayton McKenzie scrapped a pavilion proposal by artist Gabrielle Goliath and curator Ingrid Masondo. An independent committee had selected the artist and curator in December to represent the country at the international art event. The two had proposed including a performance centering Gaza. Goliath and Masondo had planned to memorialize the lives of Gazans killed by the Israeli military, including the poet Hiba Abu Nada, as part of the ongoing performance series Elegy. The duo also planned to reference femicide in South Africa and the German-perpetuated Herero and Nama genocide in Namibia during the early 20th century.But in January, McKenzie halted Goliath and Masondo’s participation, arguing that the national pavilion “should not be used to amplify similarly divisive global disputes that do not center South Africa’s own story.” Goliath and Masondo’s dismissal was immediately met with opposition and accusations of censorship. “It is nothing short of shameful for the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture to have announced that South Africa will not be presenting a national pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year,” Goliath and Mosado said in a statement shared with Hyperallergic. “The space will remain empty: a space of erasure, cancellation, censure.”McKenzie's office has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s requests for comment on the withdrawal.Shortly after McKenzie pulled Goliath and Mosado’s pavilion in January, the duo sued the cultural minister in a South African court for making “unlawful attempt” to “censor and silence” their work. Earlier this week, however, a judge dismissed their case in a two-sentence ruling, according to a statement shared with Hyperallergic by a spokesperson for the duo. The judge also ordered Goliath and Mosado to pay the government’s lawyers' fees.Goliath and Mosado told Hyperallergic that they intended to appeal the decision, arguing that the ruling “jeopardise[s] the rights of artists, curators and creatives in South Africa to freedom of expression.”McKenzie’s actions to dismantle the Gaza-inclusive pavilion appear to represent an uncommon position within the South African government. Three decades after the official end of Apartheid, the South African government brought Israel in front of the International Court of Justice in 2024 for perpetuating the crime of genocide in Gaza in an ongoing landmark human rights case.The final deadline for countries to submit their pavilion proposals was January 19, days before Goliath and Mosado filed their lawsuit.“Elegy sounds a call to mourn, to refuse conditions of disregard and to assert black, brown, indigenous, femme, queer, and trans lives as lovable and grievable,” Goliath and Mosado wrote in their statement. “That call will not be silenced.”\n        ",

    "body": "\n            Ramadan Mubarak and Happy Lunar New Year! For long, many in art, academia, and popular culture have trumpeted the Marquis de Sade as a symbol of poetic transgression against society's stiff mores. He was put on a high pedestal despite being a certified rapist who took orgiastic pleasure in hellish torture and abuse. Among his spiritual followers, so to speak, was one Jeffrey Epstein from Manhattan's Upper East Side. The latter had friends in high windows who celebrated him as a business and math guru with slightly eccentric taste in women. In a must-read essay by Ed Simon this week, he draws essential parallels between the morally corrupt aristocracies of then and now, and explains how the seeds of evil sown in 18th-century France have blossomed into today's trove of Epstein files.    I also want to shout out Aruna D’Souza's educated rant about wall labels in exhibitions, Seph Rodney's deconstruction of the politics of representation in art, Bridget Quinn's primer on Finnish painter Helene Schjerfbeck, and Renée Reizman's tribute to the DIY spirit of the Los Angeles art community.

Even as I was thawing out, a chill ran through me as I peered at a selection of works on paper by Glenn Ligon. I was swallowed up in the pits of blue.As my gaze cascaded over these resplendent works, I was drawn immediately to “Blue (for JB) #18” (2025). Made of carbon ink and acrylic layered atop a pulp-based torinoko paper, it is almost purely abstract, save for the faint outline of black letters blotting the deep cerulean surface. A mass of a darker cobalt blue unfolds simultaneously across the paper, twisting, turning, and sprouting into a network of black and blue bulbs. Amidst all of this, a singular form emerged. In it, I saw a work by a different artist: the photographer and multimedia artist Lorna Simpson’s “Night Fall” (2023). For a moment, I was convinced that I saw a figure gazing out at me with as much intensity as the central woman lounging in Simpson’s soul-stirring (and intoxicatingly blue) ink and acrylic image. Installation view of Glenn Ligon: Late at night, early in the morning, at noonIt is because of this ability to transmute fixed forms into perception-bending experiences for the viewer that Ligon will always be a bit of a magician to me. In his new two-part solo exhibition, Late at night, early in the morning, at noon, the artist quite literally builds on his ongoing engagement with the formal possibilities — and limitations — of abstraction and text, particularly its racialized dimensions. The title of the exhibition is culled from a 1964 introductory text that James Baldwin wrote about an exhibition of Beauford Delaney’s paintings in Paris, particularly a moment where he describes a window through which “everything one saw … was filtered through leaves.”Ligon’s new series of large-scale works on paper, Blue (for JB) (2025), iterates concepts he first explored in his text-based Stranger paintings (1997–ongoing), which reference Baldwin’s 1953 essay “Stranger in the Village.” To create these works, the artist rubs marks onto thin sheets of Japanese kozo paper and layers them onto studies he made for the Stranger paintings. Remnants of Baldwin’s words and shapes are left behind in the process. Then, Ligon augments these rubbings by transforming them into silkscreens on blue surfaces, applying water to them, and letting the ink dance across the paper. These larger works on paper, as well as the 15½-by-12-inch (~39.4 x 30.5 cm) works that make up a series titled Study for Blue (for JB) (2025), exemplify a line of inquiry central to the artist’s practice: How might language and color merge to birth figuration? He seems to suggest that those two elements in tandem create a unique mode of expression that neither alone, nor any other medium, could achieve.Glenn Ligon, “Untitled” (2016), archival pigment printI appreciate Ligon’s decision to grapple with another line from Baldwin’s introduction, in which he writes about light “as blue as the blues when the last light of sun departed.” For me, the moment described in this line becomes less about light and more about darkness — that liminal time when blue is on its way to black. It hints subtly at Ligon’s interrogation beyond color into not only the physical but also the metaphorical interplays of light, dark, and shadow, joining a chorus of discourse surrounding the cultural and formal implications of the colors blue and black. In 2002, David Hammons notably brought viewers into his participatory installation “Concerto in Black and Blue,” which involved viewers casting small blue flashlights against bare walls in complete darkness (read: also blue on black). The resulting work is quasi-sculptural in that it continues to be made and re-made by each new audience. Requiring darkness, as well as active and collective participation, Hammons asserts the value of artwork that evades capture in conventional ways. And in scholar Imani Perry’s 2025 book Black in Blues: How a Color Tells the Story of My People, she maps an intricate entanglement between the concept of racialized “Blackness” and the color blue. Glenn Ligon, “Blue (for JB) #12” (2025), carbon ink and acrylic on torinoko paperLigon's “Blue (for JB) #12” (2025) coaxed me in. I wanted to swim inside its frame, or at least the parts of its surface unmarred by thick layers of black lettering. The type looked as though it had been roughly scrubbed to a point of illegibility, except for a few prominent places. One small point looked to me like the letter “V” peeking out from behind this curtain of chaos. The longer I stared, the more the letter began to resemble an eye, and I experienced a moment of pareidolia — the psychological phenomenon causing humans to see facial features in random patterns. My mind jumped to another work by Simpson, “Howling” (2020), depicting a melting blue landscape ruptured by a tiny sliver through which a woman’s eye looks out. In both works, glimpses of such prominent marks amidst otherwise abstract surfaces lead me to imagine whole figurative worlds layered beneath their surfaces. I felt beckoned to plunge into that icy aqua expanse.The second part of the exhibition takes place in a separate, smaller gallery and represents a more holistic look back at Ligon’s printmaking practice, spanning the early 1990s until today. In the diptych “Untitled (Cancellation Prints)” (1992 and 2003), color is racialized, with the phrase “I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background” repeating across one of the frames. Both panels in the diptych, however, are “cancelled” out by a thin “X” across their surface. Coupled with the fact that the phrase and letter are both etched in a light cream color — meaning they lack the contrast they allude to — this work further complicates the construct of racialized “color.” Indeed, across all these works, “blue” and “black” seem less descriptive features of physical artworks than their very conceptual canvas. Glenn Ligon, “Untitled (Cancellation Prints)” (1992 and 2003), etching with aquatint, sugar-lift and spit bite; diptychLeft: Glenn Ligon, “Left Leaning” (2016), aquatint with drypoint on Hahnemuhle (Copperplate) 300 gsm; right: Glenn Ligon, “Left Leaning (Dark)” (2022), aquatint with spitbite and photogravureGlenn Ligon: Late at night, early in the morning, at noon continues at Hauser & Wirth (443 West 18th Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) through April 11.

The National Gallery of Art presents 115 works in Dear America while other shows focus on individual artists such as Mary Cassatt and Nick Cave, all in the pursuit of exploring “Americanism” as a facet of education, expression, and aesthetics. Meanwhile, exhibitions like Making Their Mark at National Museum of Women in the Arts complicate the idea that “American” is a uniform, monolithic identity, instead critiquing it as a social, racial, and gendered construction. Amid an urgent moment in American art and culture, art in the capital city this spring asks us to look at ourselves as works of cultural creation — and in doing so, to complicate our attachment to and belief in national identity.Diana Al-Hadid: unbecomingMaria and Alberto de la Cruz Gallery, 3535 Prospect Street NW, Washington, DCThrough April 12Diana Al-Hadid, \"Mood: 11:14am\" (2024), polymer gypsum, fiberglass, steel, plaster, metal leaf, and pigment (photo Emma Cieslik/Hyperallergic)In this timely exhibition, Diana Al-Hadid explores the potentials of embracing a term that many women are called at least once in their life: “unbecoming.” Al-Hadid was born in Syria and moved to the United States as a child, and she draws on her education in art history and Greek mythology to extrapolate on the construction and boundaries of femininity. Pay special attention to Al-Hadid’s lithography “Hindsight” (2020) that reimagines Hans Memling’s painting “Allegory of Chastity” (1475). It is one of several works in her exhibition that eviscerates both racist beauty standards and purity culture, deconstructing gendered expectations to their very core.The Magical World of Joan DanzigerAmerican University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center, 4400 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DCThrough May 17Installation view of The Magical World of Joan Danziger (photo Emma Cieslik/Hyperallergic)Joan Danziger has been working in the DC area since 1968. In her largest exhibition to date, Danziger showcases her pioneering work in surrealist sculpture. Although originally an abstract painter, her arrival in DC precipitated her visualization of fictitious worlds and figures out of glass, wire, and clay. Visitors feel as if they have stepped into a dreamscape gallery full of people, animals, and critters that burst out of the space.The Outwin 2025: American Portraiture TodayNational Portrait Gallery, 8th Street NW and G Street NW, Washington, DCThrough August 30Aliza Nisenbaum, \"Pedacito de Sol (Vero y Marissa)\" (2022), oil on canvas (photo Emma Cieslik/Hyperallergic)This year’s edition of the triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition features the work of 35 artists living and working across 12 different states. Its second prize winner, Jared Soares, highlights DC as a rich artistic center through his photograph of a Marylander who was falsely accused on the basis of facial recognition software. Taken together, his work and others on display comprise a study of American perceptions and assumptions based on prejudice and fraught technologies of surveillance.Mary Cassatt: An American in ParisNational Gallery of Art, Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC Through August 30Mary Cassatt, \"The Coiffure\" (left) and \"Woman Bathing\" (right) (both 1890–91), both drypoint and aquatint prints (photo Emma Cieslik/Hyperallergic)This display of 40 works by Cassatt is a welcome examination of her expansive gaze and ingenuity, including and beyond her beloved mother-child vignettes. An American in Paris surveys her prowess not only in painting but also in printmaking, which she undertook after visiting a show of Japanese prints in Paris. In this exhibition, Cassatt invites the viewer into private, often women-only spaces and intimate depictions of personal care: a girl doing her hair, a woman washing her face, or a mother kissing her child.Nick Cave: MammothSmithsonian American Art Museum, 8th Street NW and G Street NW, Washington, DCThrough January 3, 2027Installation view of Nick Cave: Mammoth (photo Emma Cieslik/Hyperallergic)Nick Cave is perhaps best known for exploring identity, race, and gender through series including Soundsuits, which examines racialized police violence. In this new show, Cave turns his attention toward the natural world and how we negotiate our relationship to it. He explores the connection of American landscape to race, and social history to ecological narratives that transcend the country’s history. Visitors are transported into a world where long-extinct animals wander the Earth again, walking through an immersive installation framed by the hides and bones of mammoths.Adorning the Horse: Equestrian Textiles for Power and PrestigeThe George Washington University Museum and the Textile Museum, 701 21st Street NW, Washington, DCFebruary 21–June 20Saddle cover, Uzbekistan (19th century) (image courtesy the George Washington University Museum and the Textile Museum)In honor of the Year of the Horse, the Textile Museum will display 60 of the 100 equestrian textiles made over the past millennia, donated by Allen R. and Judy Brick Freedman, that document how people from Turkey to Japan have honored and decorated their horses. The exhibition examines the political, economic, and geographic importance of horses across civilizations and time, as well as the ways in which domesticated horses hold immense personal meaning to their owners and are celebrated in the cultural imagination. On February 21, the same day that this exhibition opens to the public, the museum will celebrate Lunar New Year with a Year of the Horse Festival featuring performances by Greater Washington Chinese Dance.Making Their Mark: Works from the Shah Garg CollectionNational Museum of Women in the Arts, 1250 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, DCFebruary 27–July 26Tschabalala Self, \"Sisters\" (2021), velvet, felt, tulle, marbled cotton, craft paper, fabric, thread, digitally-printed, hand-printed and painted canvas on canvas (photo by Ian Reeves, courtesy the artist, Pilar Corrias, London, London, Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Zurich/Vienna, and Petzel Gallery, New York)Abstraction as a field was pioneered and revolutionized by women, a simple truth that is too often obscured in narratives of art history. This exhibition offers a correction by showcasing works made between 1946 and today by almost 70 of the most influential women abstract artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, including Faith Ringgold, Tschabalala Self, Joan Mitchell, Cecily Brown, and Jaune Quick-to-See Smith. Shaped by seven themes — Gestural Abstraction, Luminous Abstraction, Pixelated Abstraction, Disobedient Bodies, Of Selves and Spirits, The Power of Form, and Craft is Art — it highlights the relationships and inspirations of and between artists from different generations, communities, and geographies.Vishnu's Cosmic OceanNational Museum of Asian Art, 1050 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DCMarch 7–September 7\"Vishnu Reclining on the Serpent Ananta (Endless One)\" (second half of 11th century), Cambodia, Siem Reap province, bronze, mercury gilding (© Guicciardini & Magni Architetti; photo by Mario Ciampi, courtesy National Museum of Cambodia, Phnom Penh)The largest bronze sculptures of the Hindu god Vishnu ever cast in Southeast Asia will be on view at the National Museum of Asian Art, marking its first full display in centuries. On loan from the National Museum of Cambodia, the sculpture has been pieced together by a team of international experts after it was discovered buried and broken in a pit in 1936. The nearly 20-foot-long sculpture is paired with a film by Cambodian-American director praCh Ly, which transports us to its home in a temple in the ancient city of Angkor. The film and exhibition explore the relationship between space and the sacred, part of the museum’s six-year initiative exploring religion and visual culture titled The Arts of Devotion. Visitors can attend the communal blessing ceremony for the exhibition led by monks from the Cambodian Buddhist temple Watt Buddhacheya Mongkol on March 7.Miró and the United StatesThe Phillips Collection, 1600 21st Street NW, Washington, DCMarch 21–July 5Joan Miró, \"Femme et oiseaux au lever du soleil (Woman and Birds at Sunrise)\" (1946), oil on canvas (© Successió Miró / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, Paris 2026)Joan Miró visited the United States seven times between 1947 and 1968, and this exhibition argues that his journeys informed how he viewed his art as a conduit for personal and communal liberation from the dictatorship in Spain. Organized in collaboration with Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona, the show tells the story of his relationship with America through his own work and that of 30 American artists who interacted with him, from Lee Krasner to Norman Lewis to Alexander Calder.Dear America: Artists Explore the American ExperienceNational Gallery of Art, Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC April 11–September 20Kara Walker, \"Freedom, a Fable: A Curious Interpretation of the Wit of a Negress in Troubled Times\" (1997), bound volume of offset lithographs and five laser-cut, pop-up silhouettes on wove paper (image courtesy National Gallery of Art, Dorothy and Herbert Vogel Collection) With 115 works from the late 18th century through the present day, Dear America visualizes the history of the nation through the eyes of its artists. Separated into three sections — Land, Community, and Freedom — the exhibition recognizes artists not only as witnesses but activators of history, including LaToya Ruby Frazier, Roy Lichtenstein, Carrie Mae Weems, and Tom Jones, whose seminal 2002 work gives the show its title.\n                  \n                      \n                        Art Guides\n                      \n                      \n                        Washington DC\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tJasmine Little, a Los Angeles–based painter who made lush still lifes and etched ceramic vessels dense with historical references, has died at 41. La Loma, her Los Angeles gallery, announced her death on Friday. No cause of death was provided.\n\n\tIn a statement, gallery owner Kirk Nelson, who worked with Little since 2019, described her as “a force of nature” and her work as “a reflection of  her essence–at times tender, at times emotional, often naughty, always curious, and filled with wonder, beauty, pain–the whole astonishing rainbow of feeling, being.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“Even though I worked alongside her for years, I don’t know how this young artist from Joshua Tree sgraﬀito’d mythologies onto stone as if she was beamed in from Pompeii A.D,” Nelson said. “She worked in divine, painful frenzies for days and weeks on end. Monuments emerged. Five-hundred-pound sculpture inlaid with obsessively, beautifully detailed linework and whole narratives. I was awed by her art and prodigy, but what I will miss most of all is our deep, silly friendship. Long conversations in her studio about the lonely, inspired life of artmaking. She was funny and relentless and made art of the gods.”\n\n\tLittle was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1984. She received her bachelor’s from UCLA in 2007 and, in 2015, earned a master’s from Adam State University in Alamosa, Colorado. Night Gallery, Tif Sigfrids, Nina Johnson Gallery, Marianne Boesky Gallery, and other galleries have exhibited Little’s work.\n\n\t“Our hearts go out to her family and all of those she touched,” Nelson said.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn installation shot of the 2025 exhibition “Modesto Hoover Wagon Meet” at La Loma.\n\t\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tAshley Stewart Rödder, a director at Gagosian, died earlier this week at the age of 42 after battling a severe illness over the past several years, the gallery told ARTnews in an email Saturday.\n\n\tStewart Rödder had served as a director at Gagosian since 2019, where she worked closely with artists, most notably Nathaniel Mary Quinn, Stanley Whitney, Titus Kaphar, and Deana Lawson. The gallery said she worked on numerous exhibitions across its locations in New York, Beverly Hills, Paris, London, and Athens. Stewart Rödder previously served as director of sales at Salon 94 for four years and held a variety of positions at David Zwirner over the course of seven years.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tIn an emailed statement, dealer Larry Gagosian said Stewart Rödder was a “fierce advocate” for her artists. “She was also deeply respected by her colleagues at the gallery and always conducted herself with great professionalism,” he said. “Her passing is a tremendous loss and our thoughts are with her husband, family and friends.”\n\n\tThe gallery further described Stewart Rödder as “a trusted advisor,” a “valued colleague,” and a “consummate team player.” She was a member of Gagosian’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Committee, led the gallery’s Contemporary Council, and was a board member of the American arts nonprofit Performa and the Children’s Art Guild.\n\n\tStewart Rödder was born in 1984 and grew up in Morgantown, West Virginia, before moving to New York, where she earned her undergraduate degree at Marymount Manhattan College and a master’s degree from Sotheby’s Institute of Art.\n\n\tIn a post on Instagram, Salon 94 described Stewart Rödder as “a beloved colleague” and a “tireless advocate” for artists.\n\n\t“We are saddened by the loss of Ashley Stewart Rodder, a beloved colleague who spent four years at Salon 94 as Sales Director and artist liaison,” the post reads. “She was a deeply trusted, tireless advocate for the artists she represented, most notably Nathaniel Mary Quinn, whose career she championed with unwavering commitment and followed to Gagosian. Ashley was not simply a colleague; she was a cherished friend who we remember for her grace, discernment, and dedication— a rare talent gone too soon.”\n\t\n\n\tOn Friday, artist Marilyn Minter posted a tribute to Stewart Rödder on Threads, writing, “A rare talent who died too soon. She was a director of Salon 94 for a few years and became my beautiful model on a few projects…”\n",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tFebruary 27th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nA vast, mis­er­able pro­le­tari­at squan­ders its days in mean­ing­less toil. Soci­ety is under the con­trol of ultra-wealthy busi­ness mag­nates. In order to paci­fy the under­class, the rul­ing class pins its hopes on a tech­no­log­i­cal solu­tion: arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence. Wel­come to the year 2026, as envi­sioned in Fritz Lang’s Metrop­o­lis. When the film pre­miered, not long after 1926 had come to an end, that date would have seemed arbi­trar­i­ly futur­is­tic. Now, of course, it’s the present, though our world may nowhere look quite as styl­ish as the Art Deco dystopia craft­ed at great expense and an unprece­dent­ed scale of pro­duc­tion by Lang and com­pa­ny. Yet when we watch Metrop­o­lis today, the ele­ments that now seem pre­scient stand out more than the fan­tas­ti­cal ones.\nThe new short doc­u­men­tary from DW above exam­ines the mak­ing and lega­cy of Metrop­o­lis, pay­ing spe­cial atten­tion to its con­sid­er­able influ­ence on much of the sci­ence-fic­tion and dystopi­an cin­e­ma since. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Blade Run­ner, Ter­mi­na­tor 2, Madon­na’s “Express Your­self” video: these are just a few of the pro­duc­tions that take no great pains to hide — and in some cas­es, even empha­size — their debt to Lang’s vision.\nVer­tig­i­nous, inten­sive­ly illu­mi­nat­ed, infra­struc­ture-webbed sky­scraper canyons and labor­ers at once manip­u­lat­ing and being manip­u­lat­ed by over­sized clock­work are only the most obvi­ous images that have come down through decades of pop­u­lar cul­ture. For the ori­gin of the wild-haired “mad sci­en­tist” sur­round­ed by tubes and coils, look no fur­ther than Metrop­o­lis’ Rot­wang.\nMuch could also be writ­ten — and indeed, much already has been writ­ten — about the lega­cy of Rot­wang’s inven­tion, the robot woman who takes on the like­ness of a work­ing-class hero­ine. Beyond the ground­break­ing nature of its design, Metrop­o­lis has also retained atten­tion after near­ly a cen­tu­ry thanks to the folk­loric, even myth­i­cal res­o­nances of its sto­ry. It may be tech­ni­cal­ly implau­si­ble, at least from our point of view, to imag­ine large-scale automa­tion coex­ist­ing with large-scale employ­ment, how­ev­er dire the jobs, but age-old nar­ra­tive under­cur­rents allow even mod­ern audi­ences to sus­pend dis­be­lief (a phe­nom­e­non that has­n’t gone unno­ticed by the mak­ers of more recent sci-fi and fan­ta­sy block­busters). We may not live in quite the 2026  that Metrop­o­lis puts onscreen, but in some sense, we do inhab­it the world it made.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe 1927 Film Metrop­o­lis Cre­at­ed a Dystopi­an Vision of What the World Would Look Like in 2026 — and It Hits Close to Home\nFritz Lang First Depict­ed Arti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence on Film in Metrop­o­lis (1927), and It Fright­ened Peo­ple Even Then\nFritz Lang Invents the Video Phone in Metrop­o­lis (1927)\nRead the Orig­i­nal 32-Page Pro­gram for Fritz Lang’s Metrop­o­lis (1927)\nHow Movies Cre­at­ed Their Spe­cial Effects Before CGI: Metrop­o­lis, 2001: A Space Odyssey & More\nH.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAfter more than two decades as a commercial textile designer, often working digitally, Amy Gross was drawn to making something that felt more immediate and tactile. “I started making beaded jewelry, something I could hold and feel,” she tells Colossal.\nThe beading techniques gradually merged with canvases, which over time became more three-dimensional. They were “less about adornment and more about personal stories I felt I needed to tell,” she says. These eventually became sculptural objects, representative of the natural world that has long been a source of wonder and curiosity for the artist.\n“Aggregating Vivarium”\nGross’ imaginative compositions of flora, fungi, and sometimes even fauna tap into her fascination with scale. In her practice, it’s “not about size. It’s about what is most important to you,” she says. “It’s how we see and think and remember.” Beads, thread, yarn, and paper transform into otherworldly, miniature biomes.\nThe artist focuses on mushrooms, roots, leaves, blossoms, and tiny critters as a meditation on our planet’s smallest denizens. She also incorporates motifs evocative of elements we typically can’t comprehend with the naked eye, such as spores, pollen, viruses, molecules, and cells. “To my mind’s eye, they are of equal importance,” she says. “The health of the world we see is deeply dependent on the health of the tiniest elements.”\nGross’ work is currently on view in two shows at Momentum Gallery in Asheville, which also represents the artist. In late 2027, her work will be included in a group exhibition at the Fuller Craft Museum in Brockton, Massachusetts, and one of her sculptures will be featured in a forthcoming book published by Phaidon about fungi. See more of the artist’s work on Instagram.\n“Evada Dolor”\n“Taraxa Contineo”\n“Mycorrhiza Web”\n“Broodnest Vivarium 2”\n“Towhee”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nJust north of Cusco in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, a small studio draws on ancient Peruvian traditions. The town of Urubamba is home to Ceramicas Seminarios, a workshop founded by husband and wife Pablo Seminario and Marilú Behar in 1980. For decades, the pair and their team have been crafting sculptures, functional wares, and decorative objects rooted in the culture of the valley.\nAs a child, Seminario was fascinated by huacos, pre-Columbian ceramic works often utilized for Andean rituals and ceremonies rather than everyday life. This interest developed throughout his university years and beyond, as he researched the various techniques and designs that characterized Peru’s ancient cultures. Seminario and Behar ultimately teamed up to collaborate on a unique method that approached these enduring practices through a contemporary lens. “It is not about reproducing the past but about engaging in dialogue with it,” says Kusi Seminario Behar, the artists’ son who now collaborates with his parents.\n\nToday, the studio’s team of about 25 produces a range of objects in the “Seminario Style,” one defined by a sculptural impulse, etched linework, and local materials. “We apply the same level of care and rigor to all pieces,” Seminario Behar says. “Many of our utilitarian pieces have a strong sculptural quality, and several of the more artistic works originate from everyday forms and functions. We do not establish rigid boundaries between these categories; all are part of the same vision.”\nMaterials are sourced from within Peru to maintain the integrity of the practice, and the artisans helm each part of the process, from clay preparation to hand-building and throwing on a wheel to refining and painting. “Firing the pieces is a carefully controlled process. In more complex works, there is internal engineering: carefully calculated joints, slow drying times, and precise planning to prevent cracks and ensure structural stability,” Seminario Behar adds.\nIn addition to selling their works, Ceramicas Seminarios also taps into the local tourism industry and educational opportunities like Murmur Ring’s immersion program to support its mission. These twin pillars provide financial backing and visibility. “Sharing these techniques and making their complexity visible is essential so that they are not lost, and people can truly appreciate the work behind each piece,” Seminario Behar says. “It allows us to sustain the project, broaden its reach, and continue researching and producing long-term.”\nFind available pieces on Etsy, and follow the project on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWho said parking garages were just for cars? British artist and color devotee Liz West has transformed a single floor of a typical concrete structure into an immersive chromatic environment fit for skating, dancing, and basking in a rainbow glow.\nTo create “Our Colour,” West covered hundreds of existing lights in the Cabot Circus Car Park with pigmented theatre gels. Without its usual traffic, the space instead becomes an open canvas for the artist’s interest in experiencing color in a more direct and physical way. \n\n“Does colour change the way you feel? What does it feel like to be inside a rainbow? I was to invite visitors to drench themselves in the spectrum and allow them to question their individual perception of colour,” she says.\nThe temporary installation is part of the Bristol Light Festival, which runs through February 28. Follow West’s latest projects on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe second cut on disc 39 of his most recent double album, “The Fall-Off Is Inevitable” unfolds J. Cole’s life and professional career through a backward-moving narrative. Directed by Palestinian-American filmmaker Ryan Doubiago, the track’s accompanying music video visually captures the feeling of reminiscence, as the rapper looks back on his journey thus far.\nThough each scene takes place within the same studio walls through a looping cycle, viewers move through a multitude of defining moments: a funeral scene, a wedding, writing music in solitude, and rewatching home videos from 1992. Because it’s shot on film, the grain and warm color grading strengthen the through line of nostalgia and memory.\n\n\n\n“For the past 10 years, this album has been hand crafted with one intention: a personal challenge to myself to create my best work,” the musician states in the video’s opening slate. “To do on my last what I was unable to do on my first.” \nAt the video’s close, he looks back as a stream of studio equipment floats behind him, tying together a full-circle ending. The Fall-Off is Cole’s seventh and final album, and he is evidently taking it all in—down to selling CDs out of his Honda Civic trunk again, for $1. \nWatch more of Ryan Doubiago’s work on Vimeo, and keep up with his projects on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

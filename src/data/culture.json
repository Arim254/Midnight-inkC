    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nApart from a few bridges that still work, the infra­struc­tur­al achieve­ments of the Roman Empire exist, for us, most­ly as ruins. With a lit­tle imag­i­na­tion, those his­toric sites give us a clear enough sense of the empire’s sheer might, but if we want to go deep­er, we should then look into the numer­ous Roman con­struc­tions that haven’t sur­vived at all. In the video below from his chan­nel Told in Stone, ancient-his­to­ry YouTu­ber Gar­rett Ryan gives his per­son­al top sev­en “lost Roman won­ders,” begin­ning with Trajan’s Bridge, whose length of more than a kilo­me­ter across the Danube made it the longest bridge ever built at that time: a project of ambi­tions befit­ting a man that his­to­ry remem­bers as one of the “Five Good Emper­ors.”\nNo such sta­tus for Nero, though he did com­mis­sion the Subi­a­co Dams. Nec­es­sary to cre­ate a series of arti­fi­cial lakes beneath the infa­mous ruler’s vil­la, they were the high­est dams in exis­tence until the Mid­dle Ages. Hadri­an’s more pub­lic-mind­ed white-mar­ble tem­ple at Cyz­i­cus in mod­ern-day Turkey was known as unusu­al­ly splen­did even by the stan­dards of that genre of build­ing; now only its foun­da­tions remain, with archae­o­log­i­cal digs turn­ing up the occa­sion­al frag­ment.\nIn the for­mer Con­stan­tino­ple, the Church of the Holy Apos­tles is remem­bered as the sec­ond-most famous van­ished ear­ly Chris­t­ian church, after only the old St. Peter’s Basil­i­ca in Rome. Hagia Sophia may still be around, but the Col­umn of Jus­tin­ian that once stood between it and the Great Palace was melt­ed down for scrap long ago.\n\n\n\t\n\nWe only know of these lost struc­tures because we have his­tor­i­cal attes­ta­tions of their exis­tence, most vivid­ly in paint­ings: take the Pyra­mid of Romu­lus, a strik­ing tomb that appears near the Vat­i­can in The Vision of the Cross, which Raphael’s assis­tants pro­duced after his death. Oth­ers, like the Colos­sus of Nero from which the Colos­se­um takes its name, are rep­re­sent­ed on coins. In the video at the top, Ryan cov­ers three more “for­got­ten Roman megapro­jects”: Claudius’ tun­nel of record-mak­ing length through the moun­tain between the Riv­er Liris and the Fucine Lake, Tra­jan’s mil­i­tary high­way through the “Iron Gates” of the Danube, and Octa­vian’s secret har­bor at Lake Aver­nus. In our time, of course, there are no more emper­ors, Roman or oth­er­wise, and we’re sure­ly bet­ter off for it. But we can still admire — to use a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­cept — the state capac­i­ty they com­mand­ed.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Genius Engi­neer­ing of Roman Aque­ducts\nThe Roman Colos­se­um Decon­struct­ed: 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals the Hid­den Tech­nol­o­gy That Pow­ered Rome’s Great Are­na\nThe Amaz­ing Engi­neer­ing of Roman Baths\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMad­man or vision­ary? A lit­tle of both? A genius? A brand? A men­sch? David Lynch was all these things and more, and this fan-made video above serves as a quick reminder of the career and the con­sis­ten­cy of the film director/artist/transcendental med­i­ta­tor who passed away last year.\nEar­ly in the video we see one of the director’s pub­lic­i­ty stunts, when he sat in a chair on the cor­ner of La Brea and Hol­ly­wood, next to a cow and a large poster of Lau­ra Dern. No, the cow had noth­ing to do with the film he was promoting—2006’s Inland Empire—but it did stop traf­fic and draw atten­tion. Lynch didn’t have an adver­tis­ing bud­get to pro­mote Lau­ra Dern’s lead role in the film, so the cow had to do.\nLau­ra Dern appeared in a major­i­ty of Lynch’s films begin­ning with 1986’s Blue Vel­vet, and the video hon­ors their friend­ship (he called her “Tid­bit”) as well as his col­lab­o­ra­tions with Kyle MacLach­lan (who Lynch called “Kale”) and Nao­mi Watts. All three obvi­ous­ly adored him.\nThere’s also a com­pi­la­tion of Lynch swear­ing like a champ. Prod­uct place­ment in film is “bull­shit,” prob­lems on set are “fuck­ing nuts,” and for those who sat through the “peanut sweep­ing” scene in Twin Peaks The Return, you’ll under­stand his out­burst on set: “Who gives a fuc&ing $hit how long a scene is?”\nWe’ve linked pre­vi­ous­ly to Lynch’s video where he makes quinoa, and this short edit sums up that video nice­ly. It’s also nice to see atten­tion giv­en to The Straight Sto­ry, which usu­al­ly gets passed over in his fil­mog­ra­phy, despite (or maybe because of) being his sweet­est movie.\nThere’s also a reminder that Lynch made videos from quar­an­tine in his Los Ange­les home. Not only did he deliv­er the dai­ly weath­er reports like he used to, but he also announced “Today’s Num­ber,” which caused quite a lot of anx­i­ety in the YouTube com­ments. (Why no sev­en? WHY NO NUMBER 7?)\nThe video ends with Lynch’s the­o­ry about catch­ing ideas like fish—we’ve also high­light­ed this before—and then a love­ly mon­tage of title cards, remind­ing us all that “Direct­ed by David Lynch” remains a guar­an­teed sign of qual­i­ty.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nTwin Peaks Actu­al­ly Explained: A 4‑Hour Video Essay Demys­ti­fies It All\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nDavid Lynch Made a Dis­turb­ing Web Sit­com Called “Rab­bits”: It’s Now Used by Psy­chol­o­gists to Induce a Sense of Exis­ten­tial Cri­sis in Research Sub­jects\nPat­ti Smith and David Lynch Talk About the Source of Their Ideas & Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n    \n                Art Review\n                After a stint in 1950s New York, the LA-based artist abandoned abstraction and painting in favor of dreamlike, sexually charged drawings. \n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            John Altoon, “Untitled (ABS-52)” (1965), airbrush, pastel, and ink on board (all images courtesy Franklin Parrasch Gallery)\n    \n        \n            I first saw John Altoon’s paintings in 1984 at the now-defunct Edward Thorp Gallery. Since then, I have learned as much about him as possible, by both looking at his work and talking with people who knew him — particularly the poet Robert Creeley, who collaborated with him on an artist’s book and portfolio titled About Women (1966), and the dealer Nicholas Wilder, who first exhibited his work in 1965. I have long wondered why Altoon, a brilliant and beloved maverick in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and ’60s, who died at age 43 in 1969, has generally flown under the radar outside of California. John Altoon: Drawings, a small, thoughtful exhibition at Franklin Parrasch Gallery, offered some clues. While he lived in New York in the early 1950s and was in contact with the Abstract Expressionists, he returned to LA and eventually abandoned abstraction and painting in favor of dreamlike, sexually charged drawings. On this path, Altoon rejected the formalist belief that drawing hindered the evolvement of modern art, which was prevalent at the time. He further set himself apart by flouting decorum and working from dreams and imagination. John Altoon, \"Untitled (F-39)\" (1966), pastel on paperThe exhibition’s seven works, all done between 1963 and ’68, speak to the range of Altoon’s drawing practice and use of diverse materials. There are the linear, feverish, sexual figure drawings done in ink and graphite that still cause consternation among some viewers and institutions (even museums with works by Hans Bellmer in their collection). The women in Altoon’s drawings are often larger than the men. They’re not vying for male attention, and often seem to be looking inward. The men, all seemingly uniform and undistinguished figures, come across as helpless dweebs. Altoon does not provide a context, which would help locate the drawing in the realm of the imagination. His frenetic line work, resulting in an image that is not immediately decipherable, makes us conscious of our looking — he confronts us with our voyeurism, anticipating the internet and private chatrooms. His infusion of humor into the erotic adds a note of absurdity to it all.In “Untitled (ABS-81A)” (1966), Altoon depicts, in dark violet, a form that looks like the bottom half of an ostrich floating on a mottled ground of faint blue and green circles. Three bulbous, tan-inflected plumes radiate from the central form while a square in the middle of it, which we read as a screen, shows a red, linear nude whose pose recalls Gustave Courbet’s infamous “Origin of the World” (1866) and Marcel Duchamp’s unsettling nude in “Étant donnés” (1946–66). Seeing this on what could be a bird’s backside sends a jolt of weird humor through the drawing. Are we to focus on the whole image or the nude? It’s a question also raised by Courbet and Duchamp.John Altoon, “Untitled (ABS-81A)” (1966), ink on boardAltoon composed the more abstract “Untitled (ABS-52)” (1965) using an airbrush, pastel, and ink. Four overlapping, amorphous shapes outlined in red and khaki green sit atop a sunburst composed of blue and yellow rays. In each of the outlined shapes, he drew something that is palpable but still remains beyond comprehension — an invented thing.When Altoon died, he was just coming into the height of his powers. He had mastered drawing and color, worked in different media, including pastel and airbrush, and developed a constantly morphing vocabulary. His openness to dreams and imagination made his work unpredictable (as in the drawing of an ostrich’s backside as the container for a screen). This is what drawing makes possible. Altoon believed that it could still be inventive after Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Arshile Gorky. I love that he was right. John Altoon, \"Untitled\" (1963), pastel on boardJohn Altoon: Drawings continues at Franklin Parrasch Gallery (19 East 66th Street, Floor Three, Lenox Hill, Manhattan) through February 27. The exhibition was organized by the gallery.\n                  \n                      \n                        Art Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        John Altoon\n                      \n                      \n                        Franklin Parrasch Gallery\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

All works \"Untitled\" (2025), acrylic-painted MDF (image courtesy the Art Institute of Chicago)\n    \n        \n            CHICAGO — Seeing a sculpture by Diane Simpson is nothing like seeing a sculpture by any other artist. Chicagoans can currently experience this in person on the rooftop terrace of the Art Institute of Chicago, where her first three outdoor sculptures ever are on display, and at the gallery Corbett vs. Dempsey, which features two classics in a group show.Sculpture in the round traditionally proceeds in logically continuous increments. As you circle a baroque Bernini or modern Rodin or postmodern Charles Ray, you and the sculpture are on the same three-dimensional plane of existence. Not so with a Simpson. From one angle it appears deep, but from another flat; here it looks angled, there not. The different sides of her constructions simply do not agree with one another. The technical reason for this confusion is that Simpson first finds inspiration in a three-dimensional object — samurai armor, chairs, and bonnets have all been prompts — and then drafts some aspect of her source using isometric projection, a drawing style common in engineering diagrams and geometry classes, as well as historical Chinese and Japanese scrolls. It employs parallel projection and consistent angles, such that objects at a distance do not appear smaller than close ones, as in single-point perspective. So far so good. But then Simpson does something crazy — she transposes her drawing into a three-dimensional sculpture while maintaining those angles and parallels, thereby creating an artwork that makes no sense in real space. Encountering her constructions is like walking around inside a drawing. Other writers have had great fun with comparisons, my favorite being to the scene in Pixar’s Inside Out, when Bing-Bong, Sadness, and Joy take a shortcut through the world of abstract thought and temporarily become fragmented, deconstructed, two-dimensional, and then linear.Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Rocket Launcher\" (2025), acrylic-painted MDF (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Born in 1935 in Joliet, a small city on the outskirts of Chicago, Simpson has been at this for a long time. Is she having a moment? Sort of, at least relative to her age — 90 — and the career’s worth of milestones she’s achieved in the past decade or so: Her first inclusion in the Whitney Biennial, first retrospective, first international shows, first museum solo shows, first outdoor commission, first multi-gallery representation. Before that, Simpson exhibited primarily in Chicago, more or less frequently, depending on trends and connections and luck, good and bad. Her longevity has more than made up for her late start (she delayed the completion of her BFA at the School of the Art Institute for 10 years and three children). While her peers’ MFA studios were downtown, hers was in the dining room of her family’s home in Wilmette, a suburb north of Chicago. That’s where she first began to experiment with large sheets of corrugated cardboard, easy to pack flat and transport into the city, then assemble out of interlocking planes. Those sculptures filled her first gallery show, held in 1979 at the women’s co-op Artemisia, and most were not seen again until her 2020 solo exhibition at Wesleyan University. Simpson still lives and works in that suburban house, her art spread out through the attic, garage, spare bedroom, and basement. Her late husband, Ken, a pioneering medical ethicist and all-around champion of his wife’s art practice, made her studio tables, lunch, and much else. Now her grandsons do the installation. Artists need all kinds of support to succeed professionally, from the emotional to the administrative; most often, it’s been men who’ve had it in the form of their spouses. Over the course of her career, Diane Simpson flipped more than just two and three dimensions. Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Neckline - extended\" (2011), LDF, aluminum, enamel, colored pencil, on view at Corbett vs. Dempsey gallery, Chicago (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Thinly Veiled\" (1985), oil stain on MDF, fiberglass screening, pencil, on view at Corbett vs. Dempsey gallery, Chicago (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Simpson divides her oeuvre into multi-year series. Each grouping has a common starting point, from headgear to window dressing. After the initial drawings comes translation into three dimensions using an ever-evolving array of unexpected materials — which generally have zero connection to the original inspiration: linoleum, various types of wood, metal sheeting, meshes, copper tubing, leather, corrugated plastic, foam board, printed fabrics. Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is a longtime favorite. Fabricating everything fastidiously and from scratch, without assistants, out of components not designed to do what she asks of them, has resulted in years of inventiveness. Her joints are especially clever, accomplished through rivets, lacing, wrapping, and interlocking. Curvatures are achieved by scoring and bending, or, as in a roll-top desk, by affixing bands of a hard material to textile backing. In a group show at Corbett vs. Dempsey, Simpson has two neutral-toned sculptures that bear this all out delightfully. “Thinly Veiled” (1985) belongs to a series inspired by historical European dress, including a man’s pantaloon and cape circa 1562 and a whalebone underskirt, or “pannier,” of about 1750. From a certain angle, “Thinly Veiled” echoes the form of a woman’s head covering, but to me it mostly reads as a model for a tropical apartment building, ship-like, with plentiful halfmoon balconies swathed in mosquito netting. Architecture studios used to present their proposals like this, out of light brown MDF, on a simple base, with pencilled-in details and tacked on fiberglass screening. “Neckline – extended” (2011), part of a grouping devoted to bibs, vests, collars, and tunics, stands seven feet tall and cascades like a hard waterfall down a series of thin ledges. Back up far enough and squint, and those aluminum ledges become the silhouette of a neck and shoulders, the beige LDF waterfall a high collar connected to a plunging V-neck. From the side, what it is is anyone’s guess. From behind, I spy a curio shelf with curved brackets and, above it, a shelf holding an upright open book.Multiple views of Diane Simpson, \"Grenade\" (2025), acrylic-painted MDF (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic) (photos Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Note that the outline of neck and shoulders does not define a person, but a garment. Likewise, under that veil is empty space. Simpson, for all her interest in clothing, never includes bodies. Think exoskeleton, the thing that shapes a body, and not the other way around. From there it’s not a far leap to her latest work, devoted to the applied arts of furniture and architectural detailing. Good for Future, her exhibit of three new commissions on the roof of the Art Institute, belongs to this set. The irresistible title was a note-to-self Simpson wrote in the 1980s on a roll of drawings of unrealized sculptures. Here they are now, in alternating shades of periwinkle, sky blue, and olive, doing many of the things her artworks always do, plus a few novelties. The newest is being made with the help of an assistant, due to the heaviness of exterior-grade MDF. The bases have a fresh treatment, painted with black lines that coordinate with their skewed planes, like the graph paper of her preparatory drawings. Set outdoors against the Chicago skyline, the work invites comparison with a century and a half of high-rises, whose forms reverberate in Simpson’s, at least from certain angles. From others, I glimpse a giant perfume bottle, a seesaw, a Japanese roofline, and maybe an elephant. Also: a monumental grenade, a rocket launcher, and a fortress.

The camera created a distance rather than a connection; the intimacy wasn’t there. But in Miami, waist-deep in the Atlantic Ocean with their queer and trans friends, the opposite happens: Images arrive with ease. Bodies drift toward the lens without self-consciousness. Water softens everything. “The ocean is like church for us,” McCharen said. “It’s where we go to feel accepted, held, and whole.” The photos that emerge from these gatherings, depicting friends floating and laughing, form the raw material for Queer Atlantics, their newest body of work. On February 20, McCharen will host an evening at Green Space Miami as part of Women Photographers International Archive’s monthly Image Readings series, a community gathering where image-makers share and discuss works in progress. Two days later, the artist will present their first solo show at Dot Fiftyone Gallery, featuring works from the Queer Atlantics, on view until March 4.The event offers a rare chance to encounter the thinking behind McCharen’s newest body of work, a series of ocean-soaked photographs and quilts that transform Miami’s waters into a site of refuge, memory, and belonging.Artist Bex McCharen in December 2025 (photo Alexandra Martinez/Hyperallergic)Best known as the founder of Chromat, the body-inclusive fashion label now on hiatus, McCharen has spent the past several years shifting toward textile, cyanotype, and photography. In December, they debuted these works publicly in a solo presentation at Untitled Art Fair in partnership with Oolite Arts and Dot Fiftyone Gallery. The move into quilting marked a significant evolution, the language of swimwear and performance reconstituted into artworks that treat water as refuge in a moment when the state tries to legislate trans presence out of public life. From restrictions on gender-affirming care to attacks on drag and Pride, Florida’s recent legislative blitz has sought to render trans and queer people precarious, invisible, or gone.Bex McCharen, \"Aliyah in Bimini\" (2025) (image courtesy the artist)McCharen has lived in Miami for nearly a decade, after first arriving for Swim Week in 2013. What started as seasonal work became permanent once they fell in love with local queer and activist communities. The water, they said, changed them. “I went into the ocean as one person and came out another,” McCharen said.It became the site of their gender transition and the place where their closest community gathers in the face of political hostility. Quilting, for McCharen, is the medium that can hold that transformation. “Quilting is love and care and legacy,” McCharen explained. Bex McCharen, \"Floating into the Abyss on a boat of water diamonds\" (2025) (image courtesy the artist)It’s what swaddles infants; it’s what families pass down. They learned the craft from their mother, who learned from her mother, part of a long lineage of quilters in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. Recently, relatives began mailing McCharen unfinished quilt tops and scraps from decades-old projects. Those fabrics, already soft from handling, form part of this new work.But McCharen doesn’t see themselves as “modernizing” quilting. “I’m doing what people have done for centuries,” the artist said. When they’re unsure of a shape, they consult old quilting pattern books. One major piece in the Untitled presentation borrowed directly from a historic Mennonite design, but here, instead of calicoes and florals, the geometric structure holds cyanotypes of bodies underwater, digital prints of shoreline light, and the electric blues of Miami’s coastline. Quilting becomes a technology for preserving sensation: the drag of a wave across a back, the warmth of a friend pressed against your shoulder in the surf.In their Oolite studio, a draped textile of blue photo-strips slumps off the wall like a towel just shaken out after a swim. It feels like a small sanctuary. Most of the images in the work come from casual days spent in the ocean, rivers, and springs with queer friends. Many were shot with a small GoPro. “Photographing people is intimate,” McCharen said. “I have to feel comfortable with them, and they have to feel comfortable with me.” Bex McCharen, \"Being in the water\" (2025), cyanotype (image courtesy the artist)To translate these images into textile, McCharen creates negatives and prints cyanotypes on fabric, or uses Oolite Arts’ large-format printer to produce full-color panels. In “I am a river and my ancestral tributaries flow through me” (2025), a nude figure seems to dissolve into the water itself. Their limbs stretch across a field of deep blue. Hand-stitched lines radiate from the figure like veins emptying into an ocean. A long braid of beads and embroidery hangs down the quilt’s center, as if the river running through the body has breached the frame and continues its course into the world. It’s a quiet reminder, stitched into every seam, that we are all water.In these works, pleasure and joy act as a form of survival. Florida’s legislative climate remains openly hostile to trans life, but McCharen refuses the logic of exile. Laws shift, but the ocean stays open when institutional doors close.“Our relationship to the ocean is much deeper than whoever is in office,” McCharen said. “We’re not going to leave just because of whoever’s in power.” \n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Miami\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Bond/Hyperallergic) \n    \n        \n            In the autumn of 2022, Max and I walked up the iconic steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City to visit Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color. As the young son of a professional classicist, and a burgeoning one himself, my museum partner already knew about the ancient history of painted statues when we began to explore the galleries. Max’s knowledge seemed the exception rather than the rule. During our tour of the exhibition, as we wove between ancient works and their modern polychromatic restorations, we came across parents and children transfixed in front of these colorful re-imaginings — and, by the look of it, the parents’ reactions ranged from disbelief to intrigue to disgust. “It looks so, well, tacky,” stammered one woman. “They could not possibly have been this gauche,” commented a man in a suit and tie. While the adults looked stunned, the children alongside them appeared more curious and accepting of the colorful reconstructions. The young came in with less baggage, fewer preconceptions about what classical art should look like. While Max and I marveled at scarlet droplets of blood oozing from the ears of the Quirinal Boxer and took in the vivid chevrons on the leggings of a painted archer, many adult visitors almost seemed to be grieving what they thought they knew about the past in light of what they were seeing.Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color ran at The Met from the summer of 2022 to the spring of 2023. The exhibition explored the remnants of polychromy (the Greek word for “many colors”) on ancient artworks from the museum’s collection and beyond, and highlighted the efforts of classical archaeologists Vinzenz Brinkmann and Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann, who have spent more than four decades reconstructing Greco-Roman painted artworks. It also unveiled the museum’s Archaic-era Sphinx finial, newly reconstructed by the team from Liebieghaus in Germany and The Met. Vinzenz Brinkmann and Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann, “Reconstruction of bronze Riace Warrior B” (2015–16), cast bronze, copper, colored stones, silver, gold, asphalt (photo Sarah E. Bond/Hyperallergic) Chroma: Sculpture in Color from Antiquity to Today provides an overview and analysis of this epic exhibition in print. Dozens of color illustrations help bring this technicolor world back to life, along with 23 chapters from 38 scholars. The book also expands beyond the exhibition’s largely Greco-Roman scope, incorporating North America into its geographic range and briefly examining polychromy in cultures from Mexico. A two-day scholarly symposium held by The Met in March of 2023 forms the foundation of Chroma. In their introduction, Met curators Séan Hemingway and Sarah Lepinski provide an overview of the exhibition, and the broader field, covering the discovery and reconstruction of ancient polychromy, along with its history in sculpture from antiquity to the Renaissance, and the reception of ancient polychromy in museums today. The chapters within Chroma range from technical to qualitative, making it approachable for both specialists and casual readers. Along with investigating scientific and digital approaches for recovering polychromy on ancient artworks, like 3D imaging or X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), the early chapters look at the history and present state of this work. The Brinkmanns’ choice to create physical rather than solely digital reconstructions is an important one. Museum audiences can only begin to full understand the tactility and impact of an artwork when they can see it reproduced in the round.  Polychromy experts including Mark B. Abbe and Adriana Rizzo look at the remaining pigment on the Princeton Alexander from Hermopolis Magna in Egypt, while Erin A. Peters addresses the Temple of Dendur. Chapters on “Color in Mexica (Aztec) Sculpture” and Renaissance Europe are also engaging and avoid technical jargon. Vinzenz Brinkmann and Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann, “Reconstruction of the bronze statue [of a boxer] from the Quirinal in Rome” (2018), bronze, copper, colored stones, asphalt, linseed oil, madder, lake, indigo (photos Sarah E. Bond/Hyperallergic)Chroma’s contributors do a good job of opening the more specialized aspects to general audiences, but what most sets it apart from similar volumes is its attention to sociopolitical factors. Several chapters address the complexity of race in polychromy. In a particularly timely essay, Najee Olya confronts race through the lens of the skin colors Greeks and Romans chose for artworks depicting what they called Aithiopes or Aethiopians. As Olya notes, the modern state of Ethiopia is not equivalent to the Greek imagining of Aethiopia, yet modern notions of racial categories often appear on museum labels used today to frame these objects. Sinclair Bell speaks directly to the problem of historical anachronism in his chapter on Aethiopians in Roman sculpture, noting how “casually seductive it can be to import modern notions of ethnicity or race into our picture of antiquity.” Romans or Greeks were not without ethnic bias, or what we might call proto-racial notions — classicists like Jackie Murray have pointed out the “racecrafting” at work in Greco-Roman antiquity — but our modern definitions of race and space do not map directly onto the ancient Mediterranean past. One theme that stands out throughout Chroma is the museum’s responsibility to both the public and the past. Shiyanthi Thavapalan, an expert on color in ancient Mesopotamia, points out how important it is to recognize the museum’s authoritative role in “curating the public’s consciousness about the past.” As she notes in her pivotal chapter, “Museum displays do not reveal or merely transmit objective truths but rather create knowledge about science, culture, and history.” Thavapalan asks museum personnel to be more transparent in labeling reconstructions, to make clear that these narratives are suggestions rather than facts and they reflect a specific moment in time. These representations mark our evolving knowledge of color in the ancient world, so the year they were made matters, whether it’s the 1990s, the 2000s, or today. They are often educated guesses rather than 1:1 representations of what ancient viewers saw.  Remnants of paint left on the pediment of the so-called “Alexander Sarcophagus” (Lebanon, Sidon, c. 320 BCE), marble, now at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, Istanbul, Turkey (Image via Wikimedia) The publication of Chroma represents an important shift on the part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art toward recognizing polychromy and its entanglement with white supremacy. In 2019, the museum allowed for parts of its galleries to be displayed in “White at the Museum,” a segment on the television series Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. Now, the book’s 40 contributors should take center stage on the issue of polychromy moving forward. As the volume indicates, there is still a need to speak to the broader public about the significance of ancient race, class, ethnicity, gendered colors, and status discussed within. As Bell notes in his chapter, the Chroma exhibition and book help to dispel the “myth of whiteness in classical sculpture” that still persists.  When I wrote the essay “Why We Need to Start Seeing the Classical World in Color,” in 2017, I was neither the first nor the last academic to speak about the history of polychromy. Years prior, Princeton historian Nell Irvin Painter began discussing chromophobia and racism tied to our modern worship of white marble. But I was one of the few classicists writing about academic issues for the wider public. For decades now, the Brinkmanns have provided physical representations of polychromatic works that serve to combat early modern European romances about the whiteness of the classical past, but Chroma brings together image and analysis in an important volume. In the nine years since my essay, predominantly White museum-goers have griped about what they perceive as the garish appearance of polychromatic reconstructions, emailing me directly or, at times, speaking to each other in museums. Their comments resonate with burlesque dancer Jo Weldon’s remark that the critical construction of “tackiness” is often cultivated by elites as a way to signal their own supremacy within a culture. Trump’s continued maintenance of the “purity” of neoclassical architecture for federal buildings or Elon Musk’s recent criticism of Lupita Nyong’o’s likely casting as Helen of Troy in Christopher Nolan’s forthcoming adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey are examples of how White elites continue to serve as gatekeepers and perpetuate the pseudo-whiteness of antiquity. This is all part and parcel of the ways we instruct the next generation on how to view a past — one that is, in this case, increasingly redacted, rewritten, and purged of people of color once again. Chroma successfully demonstrates that color was not viewed as inelegant or uncouth in the ancient world. Both the exhibition and the volume illustrate that the ancient world was filled with diverse groups of people of varied skin tones creating artworks that reflected this spectrum of shades. The continued struggle to shift public opinion of polychromy and increase knowledge about the diversity of the ancient Mediterranean will take more than an exhibition or a catalog, but this book is a crucial step in transforming “tacky” into beauty — and exposing the next generation to the realities of a more polychromatic, multicultural, and complex past.Chroma: Sculpture in Color from Antiquity to Today (2025), edited by Seán Hemingway, Sarah Lepinski, and Vinzenz Brinkmann is published by Yale University Press and is available online and in bookstores. \n                  \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Books\n                      \n                      \n                        polychromy\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tFebruary 17th, 2026  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nFrom TED-Ed comes an ani­mat­ed intro­duc­tion to the Antikythera Mech­a­nism, an ancient Greek device that dates back to the 2nd cen­tu­ry BCE. TED writes: “In 1900, Greek divers stum­bled upon a 2,000-year-old ship­wreck whose con­tents would shake our under­stand­ing of the ancient world. Among the remains were frag­ments of man­gled wood and cor­rod­ed met­al, which archae­ol­o­gists soon real­ized were parts of the old­est geared device ever dis­cov­ered — and humankind’s first com­put­er. So, how did it work?” Above, sci­ence jour­nal­ist Max G. Levy explains the inner work­ings of the Antikythera Mech­a­nism and how the Greeks put the device to use.\nFor those who want to take a deep­er dive into this ancient ana­log com­put­er (there’s a lot more to learn), we invite you to explore the titles in the Relat­eds sec­tion below.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nApart from a few bridges that still work, the infra­struc­tur­al achieve­ments of the Roman Empire exist, for us, most­ly as ruins. With a lit­tle imag­i­na­tion, those his­toric sites give us a clear enough sense of the empire’s sheer might, but if we want to go deep­er, we should then look into the numer­ous Roman con­struc­tions that haven’t sur­vived at all. In the video below from his chan­nel Told in Stone, ancient-his­to­ry YouTu­ber Gar­rett Ryan gives his per­son­al top sev­en “lost Roman won­ders,” begin­ning with Trajan’s Bridge, whose length of more than a kilo­me­ter across the Danube made it the longest bridge ever built at that time: a project of ambi­tions befit­ting a man that his­to­ry remem­bers as one of the “Five Good Emper­ors.”\nNo such sta­tus for Nero, though he did com­mis­sion the Subi­a­co Dams. Nec­es­sary to cre­ate a series of arti­fi­cial lakes beneath the infa­mous ruler’s vil­la, they were the high­est dams in exis­tence until the Mid­dle Ages. Hadri­an’s more pub­lic-mind­ed white-mar­ble tem­ple at Cyz­i­cus in mod­ern-day Turkey was known as unusu­al­ly splen­did even by the stan­dards of that genre of build­ing; now only its foun­da­tions remain, with archae­o­log­i­cal digs turn­ing up the occa­sion­al frag­ment.\nIn the for­mer Con­stan­tino­ple, the Church of the Holy Apos­tles is remem­bered as the sec­ond-most famous van­ished ear­ly Chris­t­ian church, after only the old St. Peter’s Basil­i­ca in Rome. Hagia Sophia may still be around, but the Col­umn of Jus­tin­ian that once stood between it and the Great Palace was melt­ed down for scrap long ago.\n\n\n\t\n\nWe only know of these lost struc­tures because we have his­tor­i­cal attes­ta­tions of their exis­tence, most vivid­ly in paint­ings: take the Pyra­mid of Romu­lus, a strik­ing tomb that appears near the Vat­i­can in The Vision of the Cross, which Raphael’s assis­tants pro­duced after his death. Oth­ers, like the Colos­sus of Nero from which the Colos­se­um takes its name, are rep­re­sent­ed on coins. In the video at the top, Ryan cov­ers three more “for­got­ten Roman megapro­jects”: Claudius’ tun­nel of record-mak­ing length through the moun­tain between the Riv­er Liris and the Fucine Lake, Tra­jan’s mil­i­tary high­way through the “Iron Gates” of the Danube, and Octa­vian’s secret har­bor at Lake Aver­nus. In our time, of course, there are no more emper­ors, Roman or oth­er­wise, and we’re sure­ly bet­ter off for it. But we can still admire — to use a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­cept — the state capac­i­ty they com­mand­ed.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Genius Engi­neer­ing of Roman Aque­ducts\nThe Roman Colos­se­um Decon­struct­ed: 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals the Hid­den Tech­nol­o­gy That Pow­ered Rome’s Great Are­na\nThe Amaz­ing Engi­neer­ing of Roman Baths\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tFebruary 17th, 2026  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe appear­ance of the Dead Sea Scrolls was the most impor­tant doc­u­ment dis­cov­ery of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry. Yet, in some sense, they did­n’t deliv­er what many assumed to be promised with­in: that is, the basis for a com­plete revi­sion of every­thing we thought we knew about Chris­tian­i­ty. The real­i­ty of the Dead Sea Scrolls’ con­tent is less sim­ple, but also stranger — which makes it an ide­al sub­ject for the YouTube chan­nel Hochela­ga, giv­en its pen­chant for explor­ing the obscure byways of reli­gious his­to­ry. And indeed, as host Tom­mie Trelawny says in his new video above, they are the “old­est Bib­li­cal writ­ings ever found,” a sta­tus that, what­ev­er their specifics, cer­tain­ly jus­ti­fies the great scruti­ny paid to them over the past eight decades.\nFor it was only in 1946 that the Scrolls were found, by a Bedouin shep­herd look­ing for his lost goat in a series of caves in the vicin­i­ty of ancient ruins by the Dead Sea. Or so the sto­ry goes, any­way, and Trelawny explains some of the com­pli­ca­tions that emerge when it’s exam­ined more close­ly.\nBut the fact remains that those caves did con­tain, tight­ly rolled up and for the most part well-pre­served, a set of scrolls adding up to “around 900 indi­vid­ual man­u­scripts: 40 per­cent of them “resem­bled books found in the Bible”; 30 per­cent, apoc­ryphal writ­ings “banned” from the Bible; and anoth­er 30 per­cent, “writ­ings pre­vi­ous­ly unknown to schol­ar­ship.” Those last include “texts that described a secre­tive reli­gious com­mu­ni­ty and apoc­a­lyp­tic visions of a great heav­en­ly war.”\nMost intrigu­ing­ly, there was also “a scroll made entire­ly of cop­per that lists the loca­tions of lost trea­sure.” None of it has ever been found, much as the con­tent of the oth­er texts has­n’t forced a great rethink­ing of the reli­gion at the cen­ter of so much of West­ern civ­i­liza­tion. In fact, as Bib­li­cal schol­ar Robert Alter writes in the Lon­don Review of Books, “the notion that these sec­tar­i­an writ­ings are actu­al­ly Chris­t­ian has no schol­ar­ly cred­i­bil­i­ty,” though some researchers argue that “the blue­print for the Gospel nar­ra­tives,” mes­si­ah fig­ure and all, “was laid out in the Scrolls and fol­lowed by the first Chris­t­ian writ­ers.” They do, how­ev­er, reveal a great deal about the world­view of the par­tic­u­lar fringe faith­ful who took to the desert to keep their unortho­dox beliefs safe from the harsh judg­ment of main­stream soci­ety — and, for about twen­ty cen­turies, safe they remained.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nGoogle Puts The Dead Sea Scrolls Online (in Super High Res­o­lu­tion)\nGoogle Dig­i­tizes Ancient Copies of the Ten Com­mand­ments and Gen­e­sis\n2,000-Year-Old Man­u­script of the Ten Com­mand­ments Gets Dig­i­tized: See/Download “Nash Papyrus” in High Res­o­lu­tion\nHow Ancient Scrolls, Charred by the Erup­tion of Mount Vesu­vius in 79 AD, Are Now Being Read by Par­ti­cle Accel­er­a­tors, 3D Mod­el­ing & Arti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence\nThe Gnos­tic Gospels: An Intro­duc­tion to the For­bid­den Teach­ings of Jesus\nIntro­duc­tion to the Old Tes­ta­ment: A Free Yale Course\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMad­man or vision­ary? A lit­tle of both? A genius? A brand? A men­sch? David Lynch was all these things and more, and this fan-made video above serves as a quick reminder of the career and the con­sis­ten­cy of the film director/artist/transcendental med­i­ta­tor who passed away last year.\nEar­ly in the video we see one of the director’s pub­lic­i­ty stunts, when he sat in a chair on the cor­ner of La Brea and Hol­ly­wood, next to a cow and a large poster of Lau­ra Dern. No, the cow had noth­ing to do with the film he was promoting—2006’s Inland Empire—but it did stop traf­fic and draw atten­tion. Lynch didn’t have an adver­tis­ing bud­get to pro­mote Lau­ra Dern’s lead role in the film, so the cow had to do.\nLau­ra Dern appeared in a major­i­ty of Lynch’s films begin­ning with 1986’s Blue Vel­vet, and the video hon­ors their friend­ship (he called her “Tid­bit”) as well as his col­lab­o­ra­tions with Kyle MacLach­lan (who Lynch called “Kale”) and Nao­mi Watts. All three obvi­ous­ly adored him.\nThere’s also a com­pi­la­tion of Lynch swear­ing like a champ. Prod­uct place­ment in film is “bull­shit,” prob­lems on set are “fuck­ing nuts,” and for those who sat through the “peanut sweep­ing” scene in Twin Peaks The Return, you’ll under­stand his out­burst on set: “Who gives a fuc&ing $hit how long a scene is?”\nWe’ve linked pre­vi­ous­ly to Lynch’s video where he makes quinoa, and this short edit sums up that video nice­ly. It’s also nice to see atten­tion giv­en to The Straight Sto­ry, which usu­al­ly gets passed over in his fil­mog­ra­phy, despite (or maybe because of) being his sweet­est movie.\nThere’s also a reminder that Lynch made videos from quar­an­tine in his Los Ange­les home. Not only did he deliv­er the dai­ly weath­er reports like he used to, but he also announced “Today’s Num­ber,” which caused quite a lot of anx­i­ety in the YouTube com­ments. (Why no sev­en? WHY NO NUMBER 7?)\nThe video ends with Lynch’s the­o­ry about catch­ing ideas like fish—we’ve also high­light­ed this before—and then a love­ly mon­tage of title cards, remind­ing us all that “Direct­ed by David Lynch” remains a guar­an­teed sign of qual­i­ty.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nTwin Peaks Actu­al­ly Explained: A 4‑Hour Video Essay Demys­ti­fies It All\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nDavid Lynch Made a Dis­turb­ing Web Sit­com Called “Rab­bits”: It’s Now Used by Psy­chol­o­gists to Induce a Sense of Exis­ten­tial Cri­sis in Research Sub­jects\nPat­ti Smith and David Lynch Talk About the Source of Their Ideas & Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLondon-based photographer Peter Li considers the cathedrals, basilicas, and historic spaces he captures to be “living vessels of light, symmetry, and time.” Soaring ceilings, gilded filigree, and saintly stained glass windows both reflect religious traditions and create a sanctuary for such practices. Whether in the luminous Gothic style or awe-inspiring Baroque, these spaces are also often architectural marvels, which Li documents through an almost portrait-like approach.\nMany of his panoromas span 180 degrees and offer a symmetric, reflective view of the space through a meticulous stitching process. This perspective accentuates the dramatic, all-consuming effect of standing beneath ascendant rib vaults and majestic columns. \n“Viserion,” Ely Cathedral, U.K.\nMore recently, though, Li has begun to capture these spaces more directly, as if he’s just wandered in by chance. The two photos of York Minster reflect this shift and showcase a cathedral hazy with incense during Holy Week. Having wanted to capture this particular site for seven years, Li was able to secure early access and visit at 6 a.m., before any guests were allowed in. He adds:\n\nThe intention no longer centres on expanding what the eye can see, but on heightening the atmosphere of these interiors while remaining faithful to their original architecture. Alongside the expansive vertoramas, I’ve introduced compositions that sit closer to natural human vision. In these works, colour and light are pushed further, not to manipulate the structure, but to intensify its presence. The balance between realism and fantasy has become more deliberate and restrained.\n\nAlthough Li has typically focused on sites in the U.K., recent years have brought him to Paris, Madrid, and Prague. He hopes to develop more long-term relationships that allow him to return and capture a space under various conditions. \nFind prints in his shop, and explore more of his work on Instagram. \n“Untitled (Organ),” La Madeleine, Paris\n“Elements,” Church of San José, Madrid\n“Phoenix,” York Minster, U.K.\n“Veles,” St. Nicholas, Prague\n“Untitled,” Saint Étienne du Mont, Paris\n“Evanescent,” York Minster, U.K.\n“Rosella,” Catedral de Almudena, Madrid\n“Yggdrasil,” Catedral de Segovia, Spain\n“Amphisbaena,” The Vatican Museum, Vatican City\n“Astraeus,” St. Paul Cathedral, Pittsburgh\n“Kosmos,” Basílica del Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain\n“Untitled (Vertorama),” La Madeleine, Paris\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor all of the “progress” associated with advancing technologies and the purported conveniences of having tiny, powerful computers at our fingertips, there are certainly some drawbacks. Smartphones today—and their millions of apps—are data-collecting devices as much as they are portals to search engines, maps, social media, the news, and anything else on the internet. And the market for regular hardware upgrades and software updates can trap us in a perpetual loop, spending big money for faster speeds and the newest features.\nThere’s certainly some merit in phones and gear that are a bit “less smart.” Just as the Luddite Club, members of which prefer to switch off or use “dumb phones,” citing the value of building real-life friendships rather than spending a ton of time on social apps. For a lot of Millennials who came of age as cell phones rolled out, they’re just old enough to remember AOL Instant Messenger, chatrooms, basic flip phones, and pixelated Game Boys. The generation can recall an earlier, simpler era of digital tech and the World Wide Web despite being the first to enter adulthood and careers that have been indelibly shaped by its transformations.\n“Never Mess With a Bitch With a Blackberry” (2026), acrylic crochet mounted on wood\nFor one such Millennial, Nicole Nikolich, a.k.a. Lace in the Moon, throwback devices from the early 2000s like the Blackberry, T9 phones, and Nokia’s “Bricks” are sources of reminiscence, play, and inspiration. Through the medium of crochet, itself a craft practice deeply entwined with comfort and nostalgia, the artist has created a series of larger-than-life fiber portraits of iconic digital objects and icons for her solo exhibition user_history at Paradigm Gallery + Studio.\nCrochet—and by extension, craft—might be seen as something of an antithesis to the digital or virtual realm. One must use their hands to do a timeless, manual activity, and it doesn’t get much more analog than physical yarn and a needle or two. A stitch may also be likened to a pixel, as one tiny component is a building block that can add up to an entire image or object when combined with thousands of others.\nBy translating old phones, handheld video games, and outdated application icons into stitched fiber, Nikolich emphasizes the power of concentration, imperfection, and the handmade—not only in terms of making but in our daily interactions and relationships with ourselves and others. “In her largest body of work to date, Nikolich reminds us of the varied methods of human connection while combining traditional craft and the digital world,” the gallery says.\nuser_history runs from March 6 to 29 in Philadelphia.

Following a Trump mandate to remove public displays that paint US history in a “negative light,” officials dismantled the outdoor exhibition Freedom and Slavery in Making a New Nation. The city of Philadelphia responded by suing the NPS and the Department of the Interior (DOI), arguing that the National Park Service lacked the authority to alter the exhibition that the city had co-commissioned. In a 40-page opinion, Judge Cynthia M. Rufe ordered the Trump administration to restore the exhibits it had removed for the duration of the litigation. Rufe extensively references the dystopian novel 1984 (1949) by George Orwell, comparing the Trump administration's actions in Philadelphia to the fictional Big Brother’s Records Department, which identified and destroyed “all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded.” “As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims—to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” Rufe wrote. “It does not.”Among the exhibits taken down at the administration’s request were references to the Constitution’s failure to outlaw slavery, a map of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and a video display by filmmaker Louis Massiah featuring portrayals of individuals enslaved by George Washington.The judge argued that the city would likely prevail in its allegations that the government’s dismantling of the exhibition was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"Rufe also expressed support for the city’s argument that the exhibition’s removal would cause “irreparable harm” if not reversed. “Each person who visits the President’s House and does not learn of the realities of founding-era slavery receives a false account of this country’s history,” Rufe wrote.The ruling orders the DOI to reinstate the exhibit but does not cite a specific deadline.Filmmaker Louis Massiah, whose video works were removed from the exhibition in January, celebrated Rufe's initial ruling as a victory for the community members, historians, and artists who created the display.\"Her words make clear that history is real, tangible, and necessary for just laws and just governance,\" Massiah wrote in an email to Hyperallergic. \"We assume that the struggle is not over, but this ruling makes clear that a wrong and a harm had been done in destroying this space,\" Massiah said.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Philadelphia\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        ",

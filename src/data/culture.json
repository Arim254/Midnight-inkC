    "body": "\nAll images courtesy of the artist, shared with permission\nFebruary 21, 2026\n\n\nFor Michael Pederson, happenstances of infrastructure, nature, and the urban landscape present endless opportunities for the imagination. His playful miniatures scale the stems of weeds, reimagine gaps in walls, and reinterpret coincidences. Tiny structures and signs draw our attention to marvels of nature, like the seven-centimeter-tall “Mount Paltry,” or invite viewers into mysterious realms beyond civilization. Tapping into everyday occurrences and impressions, Pederson transforms the mundane into moments of wonder and delight.\nIf you’re in Seoul, see Pederson’s work in the show Room for Wonder at Groundseesaw until June 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n            Ramadan Mubarak and Happy Lunar New Year! For long, many in art, academia, and popular culture have trumpeted the Marquis de Sade as a symbol of poetic transgression against society's stiff mores. He was put on a high pedestal despite being a certified rapist who took orgiastic pleasure in hellish torture and abuse. Among his spiritual followers, so to speak, was one Jeffrey Epstein from Manhattan's Upper East Side. The latter had friends in high windows who celebrated him as a business and math guru with slightly eccentric taste in women. In a must-read essay by Ed Simon this week, he draws essential parallels between the morally corrupt aristocracies of then and now, and explains how the seeds of evil sown in 18th-century France have blossomed into today's trove of Epstein files.    I also want to shout out Aruna D’Souza's educated rant about wall labels in exhibitions, Seph Rodney's deconstruction of the politics of representation in art, Bridget Quinn's primer on Finnish painter Helene Schjerfbeck, and Renée Reizman's tribute to the DIY spirit of the Los Angeles art community. Finally, please join me on March 2 (3–4pm ET) for a virtual conversation with artist and Hyperallergic contributor Damien Davis. We'll discuss his recent essays, studio practice, and things he loves and hates in this art world. Should be fun. See you there?                  —Hakim Bishara, editor-in-chief \nThe Marquis de Sade of the Upper East SideLike the infernal French nobleman, Jeffrey Epstein’s story represents cruel and oppressive politics that were seeded in aristocracy, tended in capitalism, and are now harvested in fascism. | Ed SimonSee also:Billionaire retail tycoon Les Wexner continues to deny any knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes, but not everyone is buying it.Artist Tai Shani has withdrawn a forthcoming monograph with Phaidon, citing the “numerous horrific allegations” against owner Leon Black revealed in the latest trove of Epstein files.\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            The Rubin’s Annual Grant Program Funds Himalayan Art and ResearchThe 2026 grant cycle opens February 16.

    "body": "\n\tJasmine Little, a Los Angeles–based painter who made lush still lifes and etched ceramic vessels dense with historical references, has died at 41. La Loma, her Los Angeles gallery, announced her death on Friday. No cause of death was provided.\n\n\tIn a statement, gallery owner Kirk Nelson, who worked with Little since 2019, described her as “a force of nature” and her work as “a reflection of  her essence–at times tender, at times emotional, often naughty, always curious, and filled with wonder, beauty, pain–the whole astonishing rainbow of feeling, being.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“Even though I worked alongside her for years, I don’t know how this young artist from Joshua Tree sgraﬀito’d mythologies onto stone as if she was beamed in from Pompeii A.D,” Nelson said. “She worked in divine, painful frenzies for days and weeks on end. Monuments emerged. Five-hundred-pound sculpture inlaid with obsessively, beautifully detailed linework and whole narratives. I was awed by her art and prodigy, but what I will miss most of all is our deep, silly friendship. Long conversations in her studio about the lonely, inspired life of artmaking. She was funny and relentless and made art of the gods.”\n\n\tLittle was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1984. She received her bachelor’s from UCLA in 2007 and, in 2015, earned a master’s from Adam State University in Alamosa, Colorado. Night Gallery, Tif Sigfrids, Nina Johnson Gallery, Marianne Boesky Gallery, and other galleries have exhibited Little’s work.\n\n\t“Our hearts go out to her family and all of those she touched,” Nelson said.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn installation shot of the 2025 exhibition “Modesto Hoover Wagon Meet” at La Loma.\n\t\n\n\n",

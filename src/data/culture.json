    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tJanuary 12th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe term sur­re­al­ism — or rather, sur­réal­isme — orig­i­nates from the French words for “beyond real­i­ty.” That’s a zone, we may assume, reach­able by only dar­ing, and pos­si­bly unhinged, artis­tic minds. But in fact, even the most down-to-earth among us go beyond real­i­ty on a night­ly basis. We do so in our dreams, where the accept­ed mechan­ics of space and time, life and death, and cause and effect do not apply. Or rather, they’re replaced by anoth­er set of rules entire­ly, which feels per­fect­ly con­sis­tent and con­vinc­ing to us in the moment. Such “dream log­ic” may frus­trate the friends and fam­i­ly we attempt to regale with tales of our night visions, but as the sur­re­al­ists found, it could also be put to the ser­vice of endur­ing art.\nIn the Hochela­ga video above, that chan­nel’s cre­ator Tom­mie Trelawny pro­vides a long his­to­ry of sur­re­al­ism in a short run­ning time. Trac­ing that move­men­t’s roots, he goes all the way back to the ancient cul­ture of the Aus­tralian Abo­rig­i­nals, for whom the con­cept of the “dream­time” still plays an impor­tant role — and has inspired “pos­si­bly the old­est unbro­ken artis­tic tra­di­tion in the world.”\nIn oth­er places and oth­er eras of antiq­ui­ty, dreams were also con­sid­ered “a bridge for the spir­it world and the phys­i­cal one.” For the Egyp­tians, “these night­time voy­ages were a chance to see real­i­ty more clear­ly,” as evi­denced by resut, their word for “dream,” which also means “awak­en­ing.” Unsur­pris­ing­ly for reg­u­lar Hochela­ga view­ers, Trelawny also finds dreams in the Bible, “a book full of visions of the divine and glimpses into the cos­mic unknown.”\nIn every peri­od between antiq­ui­ty and now, art — includ­ing the work of Hierony­mus Bosch, Albrecht Dur­er, and Edvard Munch, as well as Japan­ese wood­block prints — has attempt­ed to cap­ture the sort of expe­ri­ences and imagery encoun­tered only in dreams, and indeed night­mares. But it was only in the wake of Sig­mund Freud’s The Inter­pre­ta­tion of Dreams, first pub­lished in 1899, that sur­re­al­ism could take shape, inspired by the ques­tion, “If the mind can reveal itself through dreams, what if it could reveal itself through art?” Après Freud came the uncon­scious­ness-inspired paint­ings of Gior­gio de Chiri­co, René Magritte, and of course Sal­vador Dalí. Yet none of them could have fore­seen the tru­ly sur­re­al­is­tic déluge that arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence has brought us. If AI reveals to us some­thing of how we think, its hal­lu­ci­na­tions reveal to us even more about how we dream.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAn Intro­duc­tion to Sur­re­al­ism: The Big Aes­thet­ic Ideas Pre­sent­ed in Three Videos\nWhat Makes Sal­vador Dalí’s Icon­ic Sur­re­al­ist Paint­ing The Per­sis­tence of Mem­o­ry a Great Work of Art\nWatch Dreams That Mon­ey Can Buy, a Sur­re­al­ist Film by Man Ray, Mar­cel Duchamp, Alexan­der Calder, Fer­nand Léger & Hans Richter\nEurope After the Rain: Watch the Vin­tage Doc­u­men­tary on the Two Great Art Move­ments, Dada & Sur­re­al­ism (1978)\nDavid Lynch Presents the His­to­ry of Sur­re­al­ist Film (1987)\nThe Fan­tas­tic Women Of Sur­re­al­ism: An Intro­duc­tion\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Backed by pro­fes­sion­al musi­cians, the choir per­forms a wide-rang­ing mix of music, from clas­sic pop and rock to indie songs by artists like Wilco, Muse, The Flam­ing Lips, and espe­cial­ly the Grate­ful Dead. Above and below, you can find per­for­mances of such Dead clas­sics as “Rip­ple,” “Box of Rain” and “Going Down the Road Feel­ing Bad” → “I Know You Rid­er.” And if you head to their YouTube chan­nel, you can find ver­sions of “Cas­sidy,” “Touch of Grey,” “Scar­let Bego­nias,” “Broke­down Palace,” and more.\n\n\n\t\n\nWith the pass­ing of Bob Weir this week­end, it seems like a fit­ting time to high­light these per­for­mances. Weir first joined the Dead when only a teenag­er, still basi­cal­ly a kid him­self, and then con­tin­ued the jour­ney for the next 60 years, intro­duc­ing the Dead­’s song­book to suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions of fans. In recent years, he talked about the Dead song­book endur­ing for the next 200 to 300 years, much as Beethoven remains with us today. As we watch ele­men­tary stu­dents per­form Grate­ful Dead clas­sics, it’s hard not to think that Weir was on to some­thing.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nEle­men­tary School Kids Sing David Bowie’s “Space Odd­i­ty” & Oth­er Rock Hits: A Cult Clas­sic Record­ed in 1976\nThe Grate­ful Dead’s “Rip­ple” Played By Musi­cians Around the World (with Cameos by David Cros­by, Jim­my Buf­fett & Bill Kreutz­mann)\nWhen the Grate­ful Dead Played at the Egypt­ian Pyra­mids, in the Shad­ow of the Sphinx (1978)\nThe Iso­lat­ed Bass Grooves of The Grate­ful Dead’s Phil Lesh (RIP)\nStream a Mas­sive Archive of Grate­ful Dead Con­certs from 1965–1995\nHow the Grate­ful Dead’s “Wall of Sound”–a Mon­ster, 600-Speak­er Sound System–Changed Rock Con­certs & Live Music For­ev­er\n\t\t\n        \t",

How we phrase something can speak volumes about our perspectives. Some words are fine in one context, but in another they might be detrimental. \"Victim\" is an example — who wants “victimhood” to encompass their whole person? And possessives are a minefield of power relationships; for instance, a person experiencing mistreatment at the hands of a partner should be defined by neither the treatment nor the tormenter (who, most often, deserves that title).Our review today of Sue Roe's new book Hidden Portraits: Six Women Who Shaped Picasso’s Life bears witness to this intertwining of language and violence. As it attempts to tell the stories of the individual women who played significant roles in the artist’s life as wives and companions, the book reminds readers of their independence as people and artists themselves. But more than that, it draws attention to how these women are too often thought of as “Picasso’s women,” when they were no one’s belongings, and who they were beyond their identities as muses and confidants to the famously misogynistic and abusive art icon.

    "body": "\n\tBeatriz González, a Colombian painter who ranks among the most important Latin American artists of the 20th century, died on Friday at her home in Bogotá at 93. Galerie Peter Kilchmann, her Zurich-based representative, announced her passing but did not specify a cause.\n\n\tGonzález’s wide-ranging oeuvre tested painterly taboos and flirted with controversy. Working with a color palette that was often termed garish or unpleasing to the eye, she initially gained fame during the 1960s by remaking art historical masterpieces, then pivoted during the ’80s, a period when she began to paint explicitly political images critiquing her nation’s government and acts of violence that made headlines.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tHer art rarely fit neatly into predetermined categories. Her paintings of the ’60s and ’70s, which featured luridly hued remakes of beloved works by Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci, have sometimes been called Pop art, though she disavowed any relationship with that movement. Her political works from the ’80s onward share affinities with many protest-minded pieces of the era, but she often stuck with her chosen medium of painting while others opted for installation or sculpture.\n\n\t“Yes, sometimes I see myself like a transgressor that didn’t fit in her time,” González said in an interview with Tate Modern, which featured her art in its 2015 show “The World Goes Pop,” a survey that has been credited with globalizing the Pop art canon.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeatriz Gonzalez’s Interior Decoration (1981) was shown at Documenta 14.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNurPhoto via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThough recognized widely well before that exhibition, González has since ascended to international stardom, appearing in Documenta 14 in 2017 and the Museum of Modern Art’s 2019 rehang. She had retrospectives in both of those years, and she died as a third one now makes the rounds. That show will go on view in February at the Barbican Centre in London, having premiered last year at the Pinacoteca de São Paulo; it will also visit the Astrup Fearnley Museet in Oslo.\n\n\tBeatriz González was born in 1932 in Bucaramanga, a Colombian city that she later credited with influencing her art. “I half close my eyes and I can see the colors of Bucaramanga, that I saw in my childhood,” she once said. “The colors of my paintings are those of the sunsets I would watch with my father.” Raised during a period of turmoil and civil war known as La Violencia, González developed an interest in art in high school, but she chose not to study it in college because she “didn’t want to spend time learning something that I thought I already knew,” as she told the artist Amalia Pica in a 2017 interview.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSome of Beatriz González’s paintings were inset within pieces of furniture. Pictured here is Ante el duelo (2019), which responds to a picture of a woman mourning a killing of a person by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Philip Fong/AFP via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\n\tInstead, she opted to study architecture at the National University of Colombia. But because she only was made to take one art history class, she found herself disinterested and dropped out. She returned to Bucaramanga, where she took a range of jobs: at a tobacco factory, as a window display maker, and more. Then, at the urging of her father, she decided to study art more seriously, enrolling in the graphic design program of the University of the Andes in 1957.\n\n\tHer breakthrough came in the ’60s, when González produced such works as her “Suicidas del Sisga” paintings, which are now considered legendary. Painted in 1965, these works were based on photographs of a young religious couple who threw themselves into the Sisga Dam, fearing that they might not achieve purity in this life. González’s representations of the couple were based on images that appeared in the press, initiating an interest in remaking pictures from the media that would remain for her whole career. Her pictures are notably fuzzy around the edges, an allusion to the loss of detail that occurred when the couple’s image was printed in newspapers and magazines.\n\t\n\n\tShe then turned her focus to pop culture and began appropriating the compositions of historical artworks for her own canvases. Where these masterpieces hung in museums, González’s remakes were sometimes allowed to infiltrate the world more broadly. Diez Metros de Renoir (Ten Meters of Renoir, 1977) involved repainting the Impressionist’s painting Bal du moulin de la Galette at a grand scale—a size bigger than the original, notably. She then cut up her version and sold it to the public by the centimeter.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeatriz González’s Los suicidas del Sisga II (1965) belongs to a series of paintings that remade pictures of a dead young couple that appeared in the media.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Óscar Monsalve\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOther works from the ’70s were even stranger. For one series, she inset her art historical remakes in vanities, bed frames, and other pieces of furniture. When they showed at the Bienal de São Paulo in 1971, curator Marta Traba called them “marginal art,” finding no other obvious way to explain them.\n\n\t“At the beginning I was keen to see how a work rooted in Western art history could be transformed, transfigured, once it reached us here in Colombia,” González said in 2022. “What happens when someone discovers a reproduction of an artwork in a book?”\n\n\tDuring the ’80s, she began to translate that fascination with image culture to current events and political upheaval, clipping pictures from the media related to President Julio César Turbay Ayala, who was elected in 1978. She made such works as Interior Decoration (1981), a vast painting on curtain in which Turbay Ayala can be seen at a party among many guests. Her composition was cobbled together from many different images in the media and was sold by the meter, suggesting that the president could be commodified and copied with ease. The piece was understood to be critical of his administration; González recalled a heightened police presence at some of her exhibition openings at the time.\n\t\n\n\tThe 1985 siege on the Palace of Justice by the leftist group M-19 initiated a “sea change” in her work, she said, spurring her to drop any sense of irony for a more serious sensibility. “What struck me most was how justice itself had been killed,” she said, referring to the dozens of people killed while armed soldiers sought to quell the M-19 group, which had taken the Supreme Court hostage with the aim of holding the conservative President Belisario Betancur accountable for his actions.\n\n\tIn the following years, she would paint such subjects as Yolanda Izquierdo, a human rights advocate, and mothers weeping following the Las Delicias massacre in 1996. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeatriz González’s Televisor en color (1980) features an image of Julio César Turbay Ayala. The artist said she once received a call from the President’s office over this work and others critical of him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollection of Susana Steinbruch\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIn 2007, she even produced Auras anónimas, one of her most ambitious projects, which involved filling more than 8,000 niches in a Bogotá cemetery with printed silhouettes of workers carrying corpses. “I had worked on tombstones previously and thought they could be printed using manual screen printing, reproducing images of a theme prevalent in national photojournalism: men carrying corpses, victims of the war,” she said. “With these figures, I set out to construct a symbol that represented what was happening in the country.”\n\t\n\n\tGonzález’s impact within Colombia is widespread, in part because she did not only work as an artist. She also was a curator at the National Museum of Colombia, and for two decades, she served as an adviser to the Museo de Arte del Banco de la Repúblic, helping to grow the bank’s collection. She also directed the educational program of the Museo de Arte Moderno de Bogotá.\n\n\tBut it is her art that has proven most enduring. When her 2019 retrospective visited Bogotá, Colombian curator Eugenio Viola wrote in his Artforum review that González was “one of the most influential living Colombian artists.”\n\n\tDespite all that fame, and despite the boldness of her art, González often described herself as a reserved person. But, as she told Amalia Pica, “It’s typical of shy people: we are generally very reserved but, when we do want to say something, we go off like a bomb.\n",

The Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery quietly removed wall text mentioning President Donald Trump’s two impeachments after putting a new portrait of him on display in its “America’s Presidents” exhibition, the New York Times reported. The original label pointed to several of Trump’s political accomplishments, including his appointment of three Supreme Court justices and what it called a “historic comeback in the 2024 election” after his loss to Joe Biden four years earlier. It also noted that Trump had been impeached twice, for abuse of power and for inciting an insurrection after the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The text added that he was acquitted by the Senate both times. That reference to the impeachments had reportedly been a sore spot for the Trump administration for years. It is not the first time that Trump has targeted the National Portrait Gallery in particular: he claimed last year that to have fired Kim Sajet, then the gallery’s director, who continued reporting to work before resigning.A PAINTER OF MEMORY. Latin America lost one of its most important artists when Colombian painter Beatriz González died this past Friday at 93, ARTnews reports. She gained recognition during the 1960s and ’70s for paintings that remade historical works by artists such as Raphael and other Old Masters, this time in a garish color palette. Those works were a commentary on the mass reproduction of images, and though some later claimed she was a Pop artist because of these pieces, González said she was not a part of that movement. Then, during the ’80s, González pivoted, making paintings based on pictures related to political upheaval in her country. In the past decade, her art has been seen widely, including at Documenta 14 in 2017 and in a traveling retrospective due to make its way to the Barbican Centre in London this February.The DigestThe Bayeux Tapestry’s rare journey from France to the British Museum in London is officially in the planning stages, with the fragile linen set to travel in a bespoke, climate-controlled crate fitted with advanced vibration-dampening technology.

    "body": "\n\tThe Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery has quietly removed wall text referencing President Trump’s two impeachments after installing a new portrait of him in its “America’s Presidents” exhibition, the New York Times reported Sunday.\n\n\tThe original label highlighted several of Trump’s political milestones, including his appointment of three Supreme Court justices and what it described as a “historic comeback in the 2024 election” following his loss to Joe Biden four years earlier. It also noted that Trump had been impeached twice—first for abuse of power and later for inciting an insurrection after the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—and that he was acquitted by the Senate on both occasions.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThat impeachment language had reportedly been a point of contention for the Trump administration for years. After Trump announced last year that he was firing Kim Sajet, then the gallery’s director, the White House compiled a list of complaints accusing her of political bias. Included in that list, which was shared with the Times, was the impeachment reference that has now been removed.\n\n\tThe new portrait is a black-and-white photograph by White House photographer Daniel Torok. It depicts Trump seated in the Oval Office, staring directly into the camera with his fists resting on the desk. When Trump posted the image on social media in October, he wrote, “In the Oval Office, getting ready to leave our imprint on the World. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\n\tIn a statement released Saturday, White House spokesman Davis Ingle called the photograph “iconic,” saying the president’s presence would be felt throughout the gallery.\n\n\tThe National Portrait Gallery said the photo was installed Thursday as part of a planned update to the exhibition. The museum added that it has been experimenting with shorter, more concise wall labels that sometimes limit themselves to basic identifying information, and noted that presidential impeachments are still addressed elsewhere across Smithsonian museums.\n\n\tThe revised label now identifies Trump simply as the 45th and 47th president of the United States and notes that he was born in 1946. By contrast, the wall text accompanying President Bill Clinton’s portrait explicitly mentions his impeachment for lying under oath about his sexual relationship with a White House intern.\n\t\n\n\tThe changes come amid broader pressure from the Trump administration on the Smithsonian to present a more favorable account of American history. In March, Trump signed an executive order directing officials to review Smithsonian exhibitions for what the White House described as “improper ideology.” The institution—long independent of the executive branch—now faces an ultimatum to turn over internal materials or risk cuts to its largely federal budget.\n\n\tSajet ultimately resigned, saying the decision was in the best interests of the National Portrait Gallery. Elliot Gruber is now serving as acting director. Similar edits to impeachment-related language were made last year at the National Museum of American History, which said at the time that it remained committed to accurate, fact-based scholarship.\n",

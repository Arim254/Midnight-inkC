    "body": "\n\n\t\nAfter six momentous leaps from a small aircraft, skydiver Gabriel C. Brown completed his mission. Brown is friends with astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy and now, also one of his collaborators. Together, the pair created a stunning image that shows the adventurous subject falling in front of the sun.\nMcCarthy is known for his incredible patience and planning, which has led him to capture an array of striking photos and composites detailing cosmic phenomena. This most recent piece, titled “The Fall of Icarus,” details the roiling, fiery surface of the sun with his friend’s upside-down silhouette. The pair undertook this project this past weekend in Arizona.\n\nLike much of his work, this image is a composite that stitches together a collection of high-resolution captures. McCarthy and Brown had to coordinate the jump and subsequent shots to reveal the latter’s free fall, footage of which they share on Instagram. \n“The Fall of Icarus” is available as a limited-edition print in McCarthy’s shop, where you can find more of his work.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLi Songsong (previously) has long centered his practice around translating archival imagery, whether it be a portrait printed in a newspaper or still from a film. The Chinese artist is broadly interested in the ways that memories morph over time and how, when we’re reflecting on a moment well in the past, our clarity over the particulars can be hazy.\nHis new body of work, History Painting, takes a similar technical approach, although rather than interpret a specific scene, Li ventures into the abstract. Wide, impasto layers of oil paint cloak the large-scale canvas, creating a cacophony of color and texture that seems to swell upward while simultaneously pulling downward. As a filmed studio visit shows, the artist works from top down, adding one thick mark atop another in a sort of grid. \n“History VII: Snake Year” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nPace Gallery, which represents Li, shares that History Painting reflects more on his relationship to the medium than any specific visual source, although, given his past work, it’s difficult not to try to find definition within the composition. The clustered ridges of paint, for example, might evoke bodies huddled together in mass, their backs to the viewer as they move toward an unknown destination. For Li, these brushstrokes, while abstract, do retain a sense of action and autonomy, and he describes them as “agentive and idiosyncratic” even as they’re covered again and again.\nHistory Painting is on view through December 20 in New York.\n“Revolution” (2025), oil on canvas, 210 x 210 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n“History IX: Mercy” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\n“History IV: Sacrifice” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArtist Andres Serrano with his exhibition \"Portraits of America\" at the Maillol Museum in Paris on April 24, 2024 (photo by Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, newly released by the House Oversight Committee this week, revealed an exchange between the deceased sex offender and artist-provocateur Andres Serrano.\nOn October 10, 2016, less than a month before Donald Trump was elected to the presidency for the first time, Serrano discussed his voting intentions with Epstein.\n“I was prepared to vote against Trump for all the right reasons,” Serrano wrote to Epstein. “But I’m so disgusted by the outrage over ‘grab them by the pussy’ that I may give him my sympathy vote.”\nIn the same email exchange, Serrano tells Epstein that he had just returned from Ireland for his exhibition Torture. The artist shares a photo of himself posing with a photograph from the eponymous series, depicting a hooded individual.\nSerrano has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s request for comment through a publicist and direct channels.\nSerrano, born in New York, rose to prominence in the late 1980s for “Piss Christ” (1987), a photograph of a crucifix that he submerged in his own urine that was included in an exhibition funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. The work upset conservative evangelists and members of Congress. He’d described the work as exploring “being drawn to Christ yet resisting organized religion.”\nEpstein posed in a portrait for Serrano in 2019, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor and only months before the disgraced former financier was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial. Serrano also photographed Trump in 2004.\nScreenshot of an email exchange between Andres Serrano and Jeffrey Epstein that was released by the House Oversight Committee\nIn 2019, the artist displayed his collection of 1,000 Trump memorabilia items at a gallery in Chelsea in the installation The Game: All Things Trump. Earlier this year, Serrano proposed a Trump altar for the United States pavilion at the Venice Biennale with the same title.\nIn July, when Hyperallergic asked Serrano through a publicist if he thought his Trump pavilion proposal met the State Department’s criteria of “non-political” character for the Biennale competition, he replied in a statement, “Of course, I’m not political. I don’t judge, I observe.”\nThough couched in the language of satire, Serrano’s artworks and public statements have often veered into offensive territory. Grantmakers for the Arts in 2022 labeled a recorded keynote address by Serrano with a content warning: “We acknowledge that some viewers may find Andres Serrano’s remarks hurtful and harmful. While Grantmakers in the Arts respects Serrano’s artistry, we do not endorse the views or tenor of his keynote remarks.”\nThe most recent trove of the so-called Epstein files sheds further light on Epstein’s art dealings and connections within the art world. \nIn one conversation, Epstein and journalist Michael Wolff discussed the provenance of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi,” which became the most expensive painting sold at auction when it fetched $450.3 million at Christie’s in 2017. It was consigned by Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev and reportedly purchased by Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, believed to be a proxy buyer for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman; the work’s whereabouts are currently unknown.\n“Is it a coincidence that the Russian who bought the house in Palm Beach and knows all, is the same guy who sold a painting last year to mbs for 450 million dollars,” wrote Epstein, according to the email exchange, referring to Rybolovlev, who purchased a Florida home once owned by Trump. “That was only worth 1.5m?” \n“So MBS was paying him off? Why? Ideas?” Wolff pressed. \n“reminder trump overuled congress on yemen,” Epstein responded, before adding that his “art guyd [sic] said the painting wasn’t very good.”\nHyperallergic has contacted Wolff for comment on the conversation.\nIn other emails from February 2017, Epstein discussed acquiring works from artists in Los Angeles and Berlin with an individual, Etienne Binant, who appeared to be advising him on collecting pieces. In one exchange, Binant assures Epstein that they “never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or anything of the kind” and promises to take Epstein only to artists’ studios or homes.\nWhen Binant asked if they were “still on,” Epstein wrote: “yes, lets [sic] start. . yes we are on. sorry with trump around it been very crazy busy.” \nHyperallergic has attempted to reach Etienne Binant for comment.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\tThe Metropolitan Museum of Art has returned an 18th-century painting to a Korean temple that once housed a vast depiction of hell.\n\n\tThe painting, titled The Tenth King of Hell, dates to 1798 and was made during the Joseon Dynasty. It’s one panel of a 10-part piece known as Siwangdo formerly sited at Sinheungsa Temple in Sokcho, the head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Each of the panels depicts a king of the afterlife.\n\n\tAccording to the Yonhap news agency, the painting was “illicitly” taken from the temple in 1954. By that point, the Korean War had already ended, though the US continued to maintain a presence in the country. “A 1942 survey by the Japanese government-general of Korea recorded the painting’s presence at the temple, and its existence is also documented in photos taken by U.S. military officers between 1953 and 1954,” the news agency said.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe Met quietly announced the return on its website, saying that the work is “believed to have been taken while the Temple was under the control of the United States Army during the Korean War.” The museum said it had purchased the painting in 2007. \n\n\tAccording to a provenance on the museum’s site, the Met bought the work from collector Robert Moore via an LLC registered in the name of Michael C. Hughes, who now serves as head of Bonhams’s department for Chinese art. The Met said it had shown The Tenth King of Hell in presentations of its Korean art holdings in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\t“The Met has a long history of working with colleagues and institutions in Korea, and we look forward to continuing our collaborative efforts to enhance the world’s understanding and appreciation of the arts of Korea,” said Met director Max Hollein in a statement.\n\n\tSix of the panels of Siwangdo had already made it back to South Korea previously. All six of them were returned in 2020 by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which worked on the repatriation with the Jogye Order. LACMA said at the time that the works were “believed to have been looted by United States Army personnel during the Korean War.” The remaining three parts are still abroad, according to Yonhap.\n\n\t“We are delighted that the Tenth King of Hell has returned to its original home. Our cultural heritage holds its greatest meaning when it is in its rightful place,” said Lee Sang-rae, chairman of the Sokcho Committee for the Return of Cultural Heritage, which worked on the repatriation alongside the temple. “We will continue our efforts to ensure that the remaining three Ten Kings of the Underworld paintings still abroad can also return home.”\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Tenth King of Hell, 1798.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Met has indicated an increased willingness to work with foreign nations to return artworks in its holdings. In 2023, the museum launched the Cultural Property Initiative, which asks appointed researchers to review objects in the collection with provenance issues.\n\n\tIn its recently reopened Rockefeller Wing for art from Africa, Oceania, and the ancient Americas, the Met makes provenance information available within the galleries. Some have said that gesture is not enough, however.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPurdue Pharma‘s years-long saga in the courts may finally be coming to a close. On Friday, federal bankruptcy judge Sean Lane approved the pharmaceutical company’s new deal to settle thousands of lawsuits related to its promotion of the highly addictive painkiller OxyContin.\n\n\tPurdue, founded and owned by the Sacklers, created and sold OxyContin beginning in the 1990s. Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 amid over 2,500 lawsuits by states, local governments, hospitals, and individuals accusing it and the family of knowingly misleading consumers about the drug’s addictive properties, thereby directly contributing to the opioid crisis. More than 564,000 people died due to opioids in the United States between 1999 and 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tWhile the details of the deal will not be released until Tuesday, it is expected that members of the Sackler family will be required to contribute up to $7 billion and to give up ownership of Purdue. The Guardian reported that it is expected that there will be scope in the new deal for people to directly sue members of the Sackler family for their role in the opioid crisis.\n\n\tThe deal replaces one approved in 2021 and rejected by the US Supreme Court last year that would have dissolved Purdue and distributed $4.5 billion in company funds for efforts to fight the opioid epidemic and resolve related claims. However, the deal controversially included a clause that would prevent the Sacklers from being sued for future claims. The Supreme Court rejected that provision in a 5-4 decision writted by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who argued that federal bankruptcy code does not allow for third-party liability shields in bankruptcy agreements.\n\n\tMembers of the Sackler family have been among the art world’s most high-profile donors for decades. However, following public outcry over the opioid epidemic, as well as the efforts of artist Nan Goldin’s activist group P.A.I.N., many institutions, including London’s National Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and others, removed the Sackler name from their buildings.\n",

    "body": "\n\tAfter acquiring Artnet and taking it private and procuring a controlling stake in Artsy, Beowolff Capital CEO Andrew Wolff has set his sights on the digital future of the art market and the culture that surrounds it. On the occasion of his inclusion in the Observer’s “Art Power Index,” Wolff talked to the publication in an interview about his plans—over the short and long term—to consolidate access to data while aiming to “amplify” the knowledge of market-makers as well as the artists whose work makes up the industry’s core.\n\t\n\n\tAsked what he sees as the most transformative shift in the art market, Wolff spoke about the move from “static forms of power to a more fluid model of networked authority” and said “our younger generations are skeptical of centralized gatekeepers; they want access, participation, transparency, consistency, objectivity.”\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tYoung collectors, Wolff said, “want to be part of a permissionless network” that could be maintained by interconnected services. “We want to give collectors the power to participate in social networks in order to discover what art they like, what it means to them, how to value it and how to enjoy it with others. And we are providing our business partners with the software operating system that will enable their clients to do so in a safe and transparent ecosystem.”\n\n\tWolff spoke of learing about a Chinese artist from Artsy, looking up sales data and reading about him at Artnet, and acquiring a certain level of “comfort” and awareness in the process. But, he said, “In the near future, our technology will allow me to learn more about the background of the artist and the symbolism of the work, watch a video that explains his creation process, connect with other collectors who share similar tastes and sensibilities, and generate predictive insights as to the value of the work in the future.”\n\n\tPart of that will be by way of A.I. “At Artsy and Artnet, we are building A.I.-native tools and services to create opportunities and solve problems for our partners and clients,” said Wolff, who added, “We embrace A.I. not to reduce the role of human expertise in the art market, but to amplify it. Not to steal the voices of artists, but to allow them to expand their reach.”\n\n\n\tAsked to project out from the present, Wolff said, “Five years from now, I’d like collectors to move much more fluidly through discovery, valuation and transaction without noticing where one platform ends and the other begins. Whether that manifests as one unified ecosystem or several connected destinations matters less than the experience itself. For Beowolff, our north star is transparency, liquidity and empowerment across the full art journey, which will matter more and more as today’s young collectors continue to develop their tastes and aspirations.”\n\n\tOf the wealth of information at his disposal, Wolff said, “Data is a privilege, and it must be governed with objectivity and accountability. As we develop A.I.-native tools, we are focused on using data to inform and empower, not to exploit or steal. Transparency must be balanced with protection.”\n\n\tHe continued: “Collector anonymity, artist ownership of imagery, gallery control of transactional data: these all must remain sacrosanct. The companies that thrive in the next phase of the art world—and frankly in all industries—will be those that combine innovation with trust.”\n",

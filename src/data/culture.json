    "body": "\n\tin Design |   \tFebruary 20th, 2026  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nBuilt dur­ing the depths of the Great Depres­sion (from 1933 to 1937), the Gold­en Gate Bridge became the longest and tallest sus­pen­sion bridge in the world. Dur­ing its con­struc­tion, work­ers bat­tled harsh con­di­tions — strong winds, thick fog, and the risk of plung­ing into the San Fran­cis­co Bay. 11 souls per­ished. Like­wise, the engi­neer Joseph Strauss had to work through com­pli­cat­ed design chal­lenges to anchor the struc­ture in the deep waters, then spin mas­sive cables and ten­sion them across the 4,000-foot span. Cre­at­ed by the YouTube chan­nel Ani­ma­graffs, the 3D ani­mat­ed video above takes view­ers on a tech­ni­cal tour of the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s con­struc­tion, decon­struct­ing the engi­neer­ing that makes the bridge both beau­ti­ful and endur­ing.\nNote: If you vis­it this post in our archive, you can see vin­tage footage that shows the bridge under con­struc­tion and then open­ing to traf­fic in 1937.\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 20th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWe’ve all stayed at the Chelsea Hotel, though most of us have done so only in our minds, through such cul­tur­al arti­facts as Leonard Cohen’s “Chelsea Hotel No. 2,” Bob Dylan’s “Sara,” Nico’s “Chelsea Girls,” Andy Warhol’s epony­mous film that includes the Nico song, or Pat­ti Smith’s Just Kids, which tells of the time she spent there with Robert Map­plethor­pe. Enthu­si­asts of the work of every­one from Janis Joplin to Arthur C. Clarke to Miloš For­man to Dylan Thomas to Mark Twain may not know that they, too, there­by enjoy an indi­rect con­nec­tion to that New York insti­tu­tion, which has stood on West 23rd Street since its con­struc­tion in 1884.\nAt that time, it also stood quite tall, loom­ing over every oth­er apart­ment build­ing in the city, and indeed over most of the rest of Man­hat­tan. Nowa­days, how­ev­er, the cul­tur­al pro­file of the Chelsea Hotel (offi­cial­ly, and less cool­ly, the Hotel Chelsea) is high­er than its phys­i­cal one ever was.\nIts rep­u­ta­tion as a refuge for artists dates to the man­age­ment of Stan­ley Bard, who inher­it­ed the busi­ness from his father in 1964. Already, a degree of dilap­i­da­tion in the build­ing itself, as well as the sur­round­ing neigh­bor­hood, kept rents low enough to attract impe­cu­nious cre­ative types. Bard dis­played enough gen­eros­i­ty to artists that, before long, Andy Warhol’s fac­to­ry had more or less moved in.\nThe Chelsea’s lat­est trans­for­ma­tion began in the mid-two-thou­sands with a series of takeovers and ren­o­va­tions not nec­es­sar­i­ly wel­comed by the exist­ing long-term res­i­dents, who appre­ci­at­ed the hotel pre­cise­ly for its seem­ing imper­vi­ous­ness to gen­tri­fi­ca­tion. In the new Archi­tec­tur­al Digest video above, cur­rent own­er Sean MacPher­son gives a tour of the lux­u­ri­ous Chelsea of the twen­ty-twen­ties, all of whose spaces have been metic­u­lous­ly curat­ed to evoke its sto­ried past. In its bar (with cig­a­rette burns care­ful­ly pre­served) guests can order a cock­tail called the Two Dylans, named in homage to both Bob and Thomas; in the base­ment, they can choose from the largest selec­tion of Japan­ese whiskey at a new restau­rant named after for­mer res­i­dent Teruko Yokoi. The expe­ri­ence of a nine­teen-six­ties New York bohemi­an is now avail­able to all of us — or at least those of us who can come up with $500 per night. \nIf you want to revis­it the hotel dur­ing its pre-restora­tion hey­day, you can watch the 1981 doc­u­men­tary below. It will let you get glimpses of Andy Warhol, William S. Bur­roughs, Nico, and more.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nNew York’s Famous Chelsea Hotel and Its Cre­ative Res­i­dents Revis­it­ed in a 1981 Doc­u­men­tary\nVin­tage Footage Shows a Young, Unknown Pat­ti Smith & Robert Map­plethor­pe Liv­ing at the Famed Chelsea Hotel (1970)\nNico Sings “Chelsea Girls” in the Famous Chelsea Hotel\nThanks­giv­ing Menu at the Plaza Hotel in New York City (1899)\nWatch Iggy Pop Per­form Dylan Thomas’ “Do Not Go Gen­tle Into That Good Night”\nArchi­tect Breaks Down Five of the Most Icon­ic New York City Apart­ments\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nYou’ve probably heard the idiom, “the elephant in the room,” to describe when there’s some uncomfortable and obvious problem that no one is addressing—the kind of issue that feels as though it’s taking up all available space. But what if yet another megafauna came stampeding onto the scene? That’s where Berlin-based artist Itamar Gov’s large-scale installation comes in.\nThe Rhinoceros in the Room is a towering, inflatable sculpture that fills a medieval church nave at Kunstmuseum Magdeburg in Germany. Gov draws inspiration from Renaissance engraver Albrecht Dürer’s iconic rhinoceros woodcut, which the artist created in 1515 without having ever seen one of the animals himself. His rendering is wildly inaccurate in terms of anatomy, depicting an extra horn at the creature’s shoulders and armor instead of a thick leather hide, but thanks to the ability to replicate it in print, it captured the public’s imagination.\n\nDürer’s image persists as a symbol of imperial might and prestige. The animal itself represents power and vigor, and one was even gifted from Sultan Muzafar II of Gujaratm, India, to King Manuel I of Portugal in 1515, providing the inspiration for the artist’s rendering.\nThe rhinoceros has also been hunted and poached nearly to extinction, and several species remain critically endangered today. For The Rhinoceros in the Room, Gov “combines historical events, philosophical ideas, and local legends and questions the fragile boundaries between fact and fiction; memory and imagination,” the museum says.\nPortrayed in monochrome gray, the gentle giant lumbers amid the 11th-century Romanesque colonnades, assuming a spectral guise. On one hand, it’s somewhat absurd in its sheer size and sense of being out-of-place, yet on the other, the creature invokes curiosity and wonder and stands sentry as an icon of brawn and resilience.\nThe Rhinoceros in the Room remains on view through July 5. Find more on Gov’s Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhile balancing atop a precarious stack of bolsters and tables, a young juggler sends four bright balls up into the air. A fellow performer stands on the floor nearby, observing the skillful toss against the backdrop of a wall-mounted tent in bright, primary colors.\nVeiled in a warm glow, the photo by Constanze Han offers a rare glimpse into a practice session at Escuela Nacional de Circo, Havana’s center for circus performance. “Founded after the Cuban Revolution, the school was part of a broader effort to make professional arts education accessible to young people across the island,” Han shares. “With Soviet support in the late 1970s, it blended technical rigor with Cuban creativity and style, shaping a distinct circus tradition that continues today.”\n\nCircuses have an enduring role in Cuban culture, one that began in the 16th century “as a family-run, traveling tradition, especially in the countryside,” the photographer adds. Combined with Soviet styles following the revolution, the circus became a distinctive blend of “rumba, Cuban folklore, and Afro-Cuban influences.”\nHan has worked on several projects in Cuba in the past few years, often in collaboration with her friend Karla Batte. While staying in Havana for a residency at Casa Cache, a connection from an earlier project that centered around the iconic Tropicana Nightclub introduced Han to the school.\nDuring a week-long visit, she created Circus of a Revolution, which documents a group of ambitious, dedicated artists and offers a timely glimpse of youth culture in a country that has been experiencing a mass exodus of its youngest generations. Cuba lost nearly 20 percent of its population between 2022 and 2023 alone, and one in four residents is currently over age 60.\nHan notes that amid the country’s dire economic situation, Circus of a Revolution provides an alternate look at the people defining its cultural output. Whether a posed portrait or candid snapshot, the photos echo the intimacy and focus of the performers, while capturing the beauty of creative expression and how it flourishes amid enormous difficulties. \n\n“Because a lot of the equipment is older and manually operated, performers rely heavily on discipline, teamwork, and each other. This creates a strong sense of community, camaraderie, and mutual support within the practice,” she adds.\nHan’s work has taken her around the world, from Tegucigalpa to Taipei, where she’s photographed often unseen communities and ways of life.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor residents of the Upper Midwest and Canada—the land of lakes—ice shanties are ubiquitous winter fixtures. From the huge temporary villages that emerge on Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago for sturgeon-spearing season to ramshackle, hand-built huts dotting Ontario’s Lake Simcoe, these vernacular structures are designed around openings or hatches in the floors so that hardy northerners can fish through holes drilled in the ice. It’s this unique tradition, combined with artistic flair, that serves as the inspiration for Art Shanty Projects.\nEvery winter, the Minneapolis-based program initiates an interactive series of projects on the lima bean-shaped Lake Harriet, located a few miles southwest of downtown. Dozens of artists construct one-of-a-kind huts that the public is invited to explore and interact with over the course of four weekends.\n\nFor the 2026 season, Art Shanty Projects commissioned local artists Emily Quandahl and Madeline Cochran for a bright, inviting, collaborative shelter. Quandahl’s practice predominantly centers around painting, and Cochran takes a multimedia approach to two-dimensional work, often incorporating textiles and weaving techniques.\nFor their “Quilt Shanty,” the duo conceived of a vibrant, blanket-like patchwork design that transports the feeling of comfort out into the lake’s stark openness. “We wanted to take a literal approach to the ‘barn quilt‘ by stretching a tactile textile over an agricultural form—specifically a hoop house,” Quandahl tells Colossal.\nA hoop house is a structure often used in gardens and agricultural settings that comprises a tunnel covered in PVC sheeting, which protects plants and can extend the growing season by a few weeks. Both artists grew up in the Driftless Region of Wisconsin and Minnesota, indelibly influenced by the region’s rural lifeways revolving around farming and deep-seated community.\n\n“Quilt Shanty” blends Cochran’s interest in folk illustrations through muslin compositions and interactive wooden quilt-square puzzle pieces. Quandahl constructed the hoop house frame and the 9-by-16-foot quilt made of studio scraps, vinyl, and drop cloths that encompasses it. To go along with Cochran’s wooden pieces, Quandahl also designed a trifold screen that serves as a key to the puzzle.\n“During our month on the ice, we found that nearly everyone who stepped into the shanty had a story to tell, whether it was about a quilt they inherited, a family member who taught them to sew, or a specific pattern that reminded them of home,” Quandahl says. “This collaboration really harkened back to the idea of a quilting bee. Historically, these weren’t just about sewing; they were social anchors for a community through communal labor.”\nExplore more of both Quandahl and Cochran’s work on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“For me, it always starts with joy,” explains Aunia Kahn. The Detroit-based artist uses a handful of materials—gouache, pastels, pencils, and gold ink—to create rich, velvety portraits that evoke folk art patterns, surrealist themes, and celestial iconography.\nReclaiming the importance of play in the creative process has been a powerful catalyst for Kahn, who had previously experienced a loss of joy in making amid life-threatening health challenges. “That playfulness led me straight back to my roots, to growing up in Michigan and spending time in Canada, to the German and Polish folk art that filled my grandparents’ home,” she says. “I realized that world of bold color, rich pattern, and maximalist symbolism had already shaped my home, my wardrobe, and the way I moved through life. My art just needed to catch up.”\n“Dissolved Into The Spirit That Outruns Fear”\nWhen she’s not in the studio, Kahn is busy curating exhibitions as the co-owner of Poetic Tiger Gallery and is Editor-in-Chief of Hyperlux Magazine.

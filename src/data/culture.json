    "body": "\n\tin Art, Design, History |   \tFebruary 13th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt does­n’t take too long a look at the almost sur­re­al­is­ti­cal­ly clean-lined build­ings of Wal­ter Gropius to get the impres­sion that the man want­ed to ush­er in a new world, espe­cial­ly when you con­sid­er that many of them went up before World War II. Take the Bauhaus Dessau build­ing, which, though com­plet­ed exact­ly a cen­tu­ry ago, looks like a con­crete trans­mis­sion from the future that nev­er arrived, or one that may indeed still be on the way. It once housed the Ger­man art school turned polit­i­cal and cul­tur­al engine he found­ed in 1919, whose prin­ci­ples includ­ed absolute equal­i­ty between male and female par­tic­i­pants — or they did at first, at any rate.\nSoon decid­ing that the new insti­tu­tion would­n’t be tak­en seri­ous­ly with too high a pro­por­tion of women, Gropius lim­it­ed their enroll­ment to one-third of the stu­dent body. That episode, among oth­ers that under­score the ways in which Gropius and the Bauhaus’ osten­si­ble com­mit­ment to the advance­ment of women was­n’t all it could be, fig­ures into Susanne Radel­hof’s doc­u­men­tary The Untold Sto­ry of Bauhaus Women.\nYet what­ev­er the short­com­ings in that depart­ment one might iden­ti­fy from a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry van­tage, the fact remains that the Bauhaus made pos­si­ble — or at least encour­aged — more endur­ing and influ­en­tial work by female artists and design­ers than almost any art school in ear­ly twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry Europe.\nAmong the almost 500 women who stud­ied at the Bauhaus, the film pro­files fig­ures like Alma Busch­er, “who cre­at­ed pro­to­types of avant-garde fur­ni­ture and toys”; “vision­ary met­al­smith and design­er” Mar­i­anne Brandt; Gun­ta Stöl­zl, whose “weav­ing rev­o­lu­tion­ized mod­ern tex­tile design” (weav­ing even­tu­al­ly being the main pro­gram to which women were admit­ted); Friedl Dick­er, a “mul­ti­tal­ent­ed artist” ded­i­cat­ed to the Bauhaus; and Lucia Moholy, whose “excep­tion­al pho­tographs still influ­ence how we view Bauhaus design today.” The school itself may have shut down in 1933, owing to the con­flict between its aes­thet­ic and polit­i­cal ends and those of the ris­ing Nazi Par­ty, but the for­ward-look­ing nature and world­wide cul­tur­al influ­ence of the Bauhaus have ensured that we still feel the influ­ence of its alum­ni, male and female alike.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Female Pio­neers of the Bauhaus Art Move­ment: Dis­cov­er Gertrud Arndt, Mar­i­anne Brandt, Anni Albers & Oth­er For­got­ten Inno­va­tors\nWatch Bauhaus World, a Free Doc­u­men­tary That Cel­e­brates the 100th Anniver­sary of Germany’s Leg­endary Art, Archi­tec­ture & Design School\nThe Pol­i­tics & Phi­los­o­phy of the Bauhaus Design Move­ment: A Short Intro­duc­tion\nThe Women of the Bauhaus: See Hip, Avant-Garde Pho­tographs of Female Stu­dents & Instruc­tors at the Famous Art School\nAn Oral His­to­ry of the Bauhaus: Hear Rare Inter­views (in Eng­lish) with Wal­ter Gropius, Lud­wig Mies van der Rohe & More\nThe Bauhaus Book­shelf: Down­load Orig­i­nal Bauhaus Books, Jour­nals, Man­i­festos & Ads That Still Inspire Design­ers World­wide\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nSzilveszter Makó’s enigmatic photographs carry layers of mystery and introspection. Standing inside curious block-like backdrops and lain against two-dimensional fields of color and texture, his subjects seamlessly meld into stories in which every detail carries intention.\nTaking inspiration from art history, the Milan-based artist references Surrealism and grotesque art through his use of chiaroscuro effects via light exploration and contrasting earth tones. Similar to 20th-century Surrealist paintings, Makó’s images delve into uncanny realms and evoke a dreamlike sense of unfettered imagination. It’s no surprise that the photographer was once a painter and has suggested that these impulses may be a subconscious homage to his earlier chapters.\n\nMystery presents itself in Makó’s photos through tactility that’s difficult to pinpoint. Subtle but moody elements—such as grain and halation surrounding moments of brightness—point to the possibility of filmic qualities achieved by chemical reaction, rather than digital manipulation. While the photographer doesn’t divulge his specific post-production techniques, he explains, “I would not call it a secret but more of an unorthodox process… those who understand the history of analog photography could probably recognize what I am doing.”\nMakó’s strong sense of style can be attributed to his distinct mise en scène, consisting of handmade props made with recycled materials, carefully constructed theatrical environments, and bold yet often sculptural garments that add visual interest through elongated lines and exaggerated silhouettes. Often highlighting designer pieces by Schapiarelli, Maison Margiela, Prada, Bottega, and more, the artist has also teamed up with more commercial names, such as Zara, and most recently, Adidas.\n“When we come into the studio, everything that my team and I have prepared, like the props, the costumes, and the designs, pile up in one room,” Makó shares in a conversation with Artribune. “I like to see it all collide. As what we imagine beforehand does not always want to come together in the way we planned.”\n\nOne of the most distinguishable motifs across the artist’s images is a box. This cubic element appears in many forms—a confined space that models find themselves in, the repeating shapes that make up checkered floors, house-inspired headpieces, or, more recently, its evolution into a two-dimensional compositional element in playful flat-lay photographs. “For me, the box is both a restriction and a liberation,” Makó notes. “It centralizes the host whilst simultaneously amplifying it, preventing energy from scattering across the frame.”\nWhile the box’s formally geometric characteristics lend itself to an evolution of order, structure, and guidance, the photographer also enthusiastically welcomes spontaneous moments, explaining that “control makes images cold and calculated, leaving much without meaning. A shoot should breathe, it should evolve, it should shock even those who are making it.”\nAlthough Makó regularly works with a slew of well-known celebrities—such as Elle Fanning, Bad Bunny, Michelle Yeoh, Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, and more—he possesses a unique ability to transcend the veil of fame, artfully translating even the most recognizable faces into something entirely of his own. He shares, “I do not treat celebrities differently from anyone else. We enter the room as equals. The set is not a hierarchy, it is a space where we work together.”\nSee more from the photographer on Instagram, and find his images published in editions of Vogue, The Cut, Acne Paper, Vanity Fair, GQ, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Studio Ghibli’s PONYO debuts February 14 at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, which opened in 2021 with a Miyazaki retrospective. This show aims to convey the film’s whimsy and wonder while examining its profound significance through Miyazaki’s drawings and other elements behind its production.“He set out to do a simple film with a simple storyline for young children,” exhibition curator Jessica Niebel told Hyperallergic. “He achieved that, but Ponyo is also very multi-layered and complex.”Art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida are on view in the exhibition. (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)After creating films for a slightly older audience, such as Princess Mononoke (1997) and Spirited Away (2001), Miyazaki had younger children in mind with Ponyo, which was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Little Mermaid. In keeping with this, the sight lines of much of the exhibition are intentionally lowered, said Shraddha Aryal, executive VP of exhibitions at the Academy Museum. She and her team also designed interactive elements, such as a movable figure of Ponyo running across the waves and a large-scale green bucket based on the one that Sosuke keeps Ponyo in, which smaller visitors can crawl into.There is also an interactive animation table, featuring colorful sea-creature cut-outs designed by Studio Ghibli. Using their phone and an app, guests can rearrange squid, crabs, sharks, and a pufferfish to create their own stop-motion film.The show includes a large-scale green bucket, a reference from the film, which smaller visitors can crawl into. (© Academy Museum Foundation, photo by Emily Shur)To reference the organic forms of Ponyo’s nautical world, Miyazaki was adamant that only curved lines be used in the film’s animation. “Get rid of straight lines. Use gently warped lines that allow the possibility of magic to exist, liberating us from the curse of perspective drawing. A world where even the horizon swells, dips, and sways,” he intones from a wall panel in the exhibition. Aryal echoed this sentiment in the exhibition design, even fabricating circular frames for the watercolor and pastel art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida.Ponyo is significant in part because it was completely hand-drawn, a return to form after some computer animation was used in previous Ghibli films. The exhibition features over 100 objects donated by Studio Ghibli, including several drawings by Miyazaki, highlighting the analog aspect of the film’s creation. The works are staged around a modest wooden desk used by Ghibli animators.A wooden desk used by Ghibli animators (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)These objects, with their distinctly human traces, will perhaps be even more deeply appreciated by audiences today, amid an onslaught of digitally generated images often indistinguishable from reality. Studio Ghibli’s Ponyo is not an exhaustive cinematic overview of the film, but rather an evocative experience that channels some of its captivating enchantment. “The film has these moments of slowing down, contemplative, mesmerizing moments,” Niebel said, adding that the oversized bucket offers an entry point into this calm, cool world. “Originally, we wanted to make it a little smaller, and then our director Amy Homma asked, ‘What if adults want to crawl in, too?’”Installation view of Studio Ghibli’s PONYO at the Academy Museum (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Los Angeles\n                      \n                      \n                        Studio Ghibli\n                      \n                      \n                        Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Artists, cultural workers, and partners in government and philanthropy have organized through cultural plans like CreateNYC and the People’s Cultural Plan; weekly Culture@3 and New Yorkers for Culture and Arts advocacy calls; coalitions like the Cultural Equity Coalition, Latinx Arts Consortium of New York, Safety Net Coalition, and Voices for Creative New York; as well as shared advocacy — building infrastructure for coordination and accountability. Through the hard lessons of COVID-19, we deepened our attention to equity, labor conditions, and mutual support. In the process, we built durable habits of collaboration: sharing information, coordinating policy asks, aligning narratives, and showing up for one another as public and private systems strained.In this context, the commissioner’s role is not simply to administer programs. It is to practice partnership as a governing method; to translate what the field knows into policy and budgets; to convene with earned legitimacy across agencies, communities, and funders; and to make City government a reliable collaborator through transparency, predictable processes, and consistent follow-through.The urgency is obvious. New York is in a deep affordability crisis that is reshaping who can live and work here, and which institutions can survive. At the same time, the cultural ecosystem is reckoning with systemic disinvestment — compounded by years of culture-war politics, shifting private funding priorities, and a cultural governance structure dispersed across agencies and decision-makers, often without clear coordination or accountability.The good news is that the sector is not waiting to be saved. We are coordinated. We are practiced in collective action, and ready for a commissioner who meets that capacity with reciprocity, collective leadership, and compassion.This is why the moment demands it — because none of us can face the challenges ahead alone, nor should we envision our city's future in isolation. New York’s cultural life is not a luxury; it is civic infrastructure — how we make meaning, build belonging, improve community well-being, and create economic opportunities for all New Yorkers. The next NYC Commissioner for Cultural Affairs can help make that future real by treating artists, cultural workers, and cultural organizations as co-creators of the city’s story, and by building government as a steady partner in the work of imagining and sustaining a livable, plural New York.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        DCLA\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

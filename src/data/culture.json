    "body": "\n\tin Architecture |   \tFebruary 9th, 2026  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nFew pro­fes­sion­als tend to live as long, or mature as slow­ly, as archi­tects. Frank Gehry died late last year at the for­mi­da­ble age of 96, with sev­er­al projects still under con­struc­tion. But he’d only real­ly been Frank Gehry for the past half-cen­tu­ry or so: not in the sense of hav­ing changed his name from Frank Gold­berg (a choice he made in his twen­ties and lat­er came to regret), but in hav­ing plant­ed his first rec­og­niz­able flag in the built envi­ron­ment. The envi­ron­ment was a qui­et mid­dle-class res­i­den­tial neigh­bor­hood in San­ta Mon­i­ca; the flag was his own home, a mod­est Dutch Colo­nial fix­er-upper orig­i­nal­ly built in 1920, and trans­formed by Gehry into what resem­bled a high­ly con­trolled indus­tri­al dis­as­ter.\n“He for­ti­fied parts of the pas­tel-paint­ed, shin­gled exte­ri­or with cor­ru­gat­ed steel, wrapped lay­ers of chain-link fenc­ing over oth­er por­tions in angu­lar planes not seen since Russ­ian Con­struc­tivism, and slammed a tilt­ed cubic sky­light, which looked as if it had fall­en from out­er space, into the kitchen,” writes New York Review of Books archi­tec­ture crit­ic Mar­tin Filler in his remem­brance of the archi­tect.\n“In the inte­ri­or he exposed walls down to the wood­en studs and treat­ed ves­ti­gial white plas­ter patch­es as though they were Robert Ryman paint­ings. Para­dox­i­cal­ly, this messy mash-up also exud­ed a cozy domes­tic­i­ty,” a qual­i­ty on dis­play in Beyond Utopia: Chang­ing Atti­tudes in Amer­i­can Archi­tec­ture, a 1983 doc­u­men­tary co-writ­ten by Filler that includes an inter­view with Gehry in the house­’s kitchen.\n\n\n\t\n\nAbout fif­teen years before the Guggen­heim Bil­bao, and two decades before Dis­ney Con­cert Hall, the star­chi­tect-to-be sits in the kitchen of his rad­i­cal­ly ren­o­vat­ed home with his two young sons. “I like that when you look through the top you can see down here in the kitchen,” says one of them. Now, here to speak more expan­sive­ly on the pro­jec­t’s virtues, and how they fit into the longer arc of Gehry’s career, is archi­tect and star of Archi­tec­tur­al Design’s Youtube chan­nel star Michael Wyet­zn­er, with a new video called “What Frank Gehry’s Per­son­al Home Teach­es Us About Cre­ative Risk.” And indeed, such risk-tak­ing stood out in his own gen­er­a­tion, most of whose major archi­tects adhered one way or anoth­er to mod­ernist or post­mod­ernist trends. As his home ren­o­va­tion sig­naled, Gehry decid­ed to go his own way.\nAt a glance, the jagged, almost aggres­sive look of the Gehry res­i­dence may hard­ly bring to mind the gleam­ing metal­lic curves, almost invari­ably described as “undu­lat­ing,” of the Guggen­heim Bil­bao and Dis­ney Hall. But Wyet­zn­er finds deep­er res­o­nances with var­i­ous ele­ments of the aes­thet­ic sen­si­bil­i­ty that Gehry cul­ti­vat­ed in his work from his mid­dle-age self-rein­ven­tion through his nona­ge­nar­i­an emi­nence, not least empha­siz­ing the impres­sion of move­ment and the “noisy ver­sus qui­et” visu­al dynam­ic. Con­trast is pow­er, as all artists under­stand on one lev­el or anoth­er — and, per­haps, as Frank Gehry came to under­stand that while hang­ing out with Los Ange­les artists before he made his name. Though he nev­er exact­ly joined their ranks, it is as an “artist-archi­tect,” in Wyet­zn­er’s words, that he will be remem­bered.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Frank Gehry (RIP) and the Guggen­heim Muse­um Bil­bao Changed Archi­tec­ture\nGehry’s Vision for Archi­tec­ture\nVis­it the Homes That Great Archi­tects Designed for Them­selves: Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Cor­busier, Wal­ter Gropius & Frank Gehry\nOn the Impor­tance of the Cre­ative Brief: Frank Gehry, Maira Kalman & Oth­ers Explain its Essen­tial Role\nTake an Online Course on Design & Archi­tec­ture with Frank Gehry\nA Walk­ing Tour of Los Ange­les Archi­tec­ture: From Art Deco to Cal­i­for­nia Bun­ga­low\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Psychology |   \tFebruary 9th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe age of social media has shown human­i­ty a fair few truths about itself, not all of them flat­ter­ing. But once in a while, one of the waves of dis­course that roll through the inter­net real­ly does help us bet­ter under­stand one anoth­er. Take the sur­prise some have expressed in recent years upon find­ing out that the expres­sion to “pic­ture” some­thing in one’s head isn’t just a fig­ure of speech. You mean that peo­ple “pic­tur­ing an apple,” say, haven’t been just think­ing about an apple, but actu­al­ly see­ing one in their heads? The inabil­i­ty to do that has a name: aphan­ta­sia, from the Greek word phan­ta­sia, “image,” and pre­fix -a, “with­out.”\nThat same tem­plate has late­ly been used to cre­ate anoth­er term, anen­dopha­sia, whose roots endo and pha­sia mean “inner” and “speech.” As you might expect, the word refers to the lack of an inter­nal mono­logue. That sounds bizarre to many who hear it for the first time: some because they can’t imag­ine think­ing in words, and oth­ers because they can’t imag­ine think­ing in any­thing else.\nThese, as explained in the Void­ed Thoughts video above, are just some of the ways the expe­ri­ences inside our heads dif­fer. Some 40 per­cent of us hear and even have con­ver­sa­tions with “inter­nal voic­es,” about 50 per­cent of us see things in our mind’s eye instead, and some 20 per­cent report think­ing exclu­sive­ly in feel­ings. Those who belong to one of those groups will have trou­ble imag­in­ing what life is like for any­one in the oth­ers.\nThis owes to the inher­ent inac­ces­si­bil­i­ty of one human being’s sub­jec­tive expe­ri­ence to anoth­er, a con­di­tion that has bedev­iled philoso­phers prac­ti­cal­ly since the emer­gence of their pro­fes­sion. But sci­en­tif­ic researchers have also been look­ing into it, and their stud­ies have sug­gest­ed that the capac­i­ty for inter­nal mono­logues and men­tal pic­tures makes more than a triv­ial dif­fer­ence in one’s life. Visu­al thinkers, the video notes, tend to be bet­ter at mem­o­riza­tion; ver­bal thinkers “usu­al­ly have an edge when it comes to plan­ning, prob­lem-solv­ing, and rehears­ing,” but they’re also “more prone to loop­ing thoughts.” In prac­tice, most of us use both forms of think­ing in dif­fer­ent pro­por­tions depend­ing on the sit­u­a­tion, and thus, to an extent, enjoy both sets of advan­tages — and should watch out for both sets of dis­ad­van­tages.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow to Silence the Neg­a­tive Chat­ter in Our Heads: Psy­chol­o­gy Pro­fes­sor Ethan Kross Explains\nHow to Improve Your Mem­o­ry: Four TED Talks Explain the Tech­niques to Remem­ber Any­thing\nThe Secret to High Per­for­mance and Ful­fil­ment: Psy­chol­o­gist Daniel Gole­man Explains the Pow­er of Focus\nWhy You Do Your Best Think­ing In The Show­er: Cre­ativ­i­ty & the “Incu­ba­tion Peri­od”\nWhat a Lack of Social Con­tact Does to Your Brain\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nEvery year, a plastic called polyethylene terephthalate, commonly referred to as PET, is used to produce around 600 billion bottles and other packaging. Think juice containers, detergent jugs, soft jars, and shampoo bottles, plus myriad other items like carpeting, synthetic fabrics, and industrial applications. Tons upon tons of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or even floating in the ocean.\nSpanish design firm PET Lamp set out give another purpose to these otherwise short-lived materials. Partnering with artisans in communities from Chile to Ethiopia to Australia, the company celebrates both Indigeneity and sustainability, drawing upon time-honored global craft traditions while supporting local economies and recycling discarded materials.\nArtisans with a newly finished PET Lamp project\nPictured here are the studio’s woven Gurunsi lamps, made in special-order batches in the remote community of Bolgatanga, Ghana. This is the capital of Gurunsi culture and is known for its clay homes, which women paint with elaborate geometric patterns. PET Lamp commissioned artisans with basket-weaving skills to create unique, sprawling textiles that, once shipped to the company’s headquarters in Spain, are fitted with electrical elements and hardware.\nPET Lamp is deeply involved in the making process and ensures it’s a mutually positive partnership by beginning with three questions: “Is a collaboration logistically possible? Is there a strong weaving tradition that we can elevate through collaboration? And will this project be of benefit to the artisans?”\nLocal Indigenous design inspires the fixtures’ forms. Gurunsi lamps are influenced by Ghanaian vernacular architecture, while Thailand-made bamboo shades called Pikul take their cue from the Spanish cherry tree’s flowers, which are found all over Southeast Asia and are often represented in regional arts and crafts. The colorful Eperara Siapidara, a series produced in Colombia, reimagines traditional geometric motifs.\nFind more on PET Lamp’s website.\n\n\nAn aerial overview of a traditional Gurunsi home layout\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen Victoria Dugger encountered Jasper Johns’ “Flag” during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art in 2024, she found herself contemplating similar ideas. The encaustic painting is one of Johns’ most recognizable works and revels in ambiguity: although it bears stars and stripes, it’s not an exact representation of Old Glory, nor is it solely a gestural, abstract work. Instead, “Flag” prompts questions about motif, material, and meaning that defy any singular narrative.\nFor Dugger, Johns’ multivalent approach felt particularly apt 70 years later. On the eve of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, she began a body of work that reflects a similar set of inquiries through the lens of Blackness, disability, and desire.\n“Freak Flag II” (2025), gouache, barbed wire, and glitter on panel, 60 x 36 x 4 inches\nFreak Flags, on view this month at Sargent’s Daughters, reinterprets the United States flag through gingham, glitter, beads, fringe, and more. The title of the exhibition implicates the legacy of freak shows, which often exploited people with disabilities and diseases and presented them as odd curiosities. Spectacle takes a different form in Dugger’s mixed-media works, though, as she replaces stars with glittery tasseled pasties and lines the edges with vibrantly dyed locks of hair.\nThere are also miniature picket fences and curls of barbed wire woven throughout some of the compositions. While the former symbolizes the ideal of safety and suburbanization within the American Dream, the latter nods to a history of domination and discrimination from Manifest Destiny to Japanese internment to contemporary immigration practices along the southern border.\nThese sinister elements sit alongside fields of gouache flowers, dainty butterflies, and frilly piping. This complicated mishmash captures the fraught history and ideals that continue to shape American identity and policies. While some of Dugger’s flags are presented upright with the rectangular patch in the top left corner, others are flipped upside down, a long-utilized symbol of a nation in distress.\nSee Freak Flags through February 28. Keep up with Dugger’s work on Instagram.\nDetail of “Freak Flag I”\n“Freak Flag I” (2025), gouache, barbed wire, and glitter on panel, 60 x 36 x 4 inches\n“Freak Flag V” (2025), gouache, barbed wire, and glitter on panel, 60 x 36 x 4 inches\nDetail of “Freak Flag I”\n“Freak Flag IV” (2025), gouache, barbed wire, and glitter on panel, 60 x 36 x 4 inches\n“Freak Flag III” (2025), gouache, barbed wire, and glitter on panel, 60 x 36 x 4 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAs a child, Artem “Alfred” Nakache (1915-1983) was afraid of water. The youngest of 11 children in a Jewish family that emigrated from Iraq to Constantine, Algeria, Alfred eventually overcame his terror of the depths and actually excelled at swimming. He became so skilled that by the mid-1930s, he had won both local and French national competitions—Algeria was under the control of France at the time—and moved to Paris to pursue his competitive career. He would, however, be impacted by an unthinkable tragedy, indelibly linked to what he would eventually accomplish.\nA short film by director and artist Florence Miailhe titled “Papillon,” which is nominated for an Oscar this year, is based on Nakache’s extraordinary story and resilience in the face of unprecedented adversity during the Holocaust.\n\n\n\nThe star’s talent earned him numerous accolades and made him popular in France despite the Nazi occupation of Paris starting in 1940. By 1943, though, attitudes had shifted dramatically. He was ousted from a tournament as a result of being Jewish, and later that year, arrested by the Gestapo along with his wife and child. They were eventually transported to Auschwitz, separated, and never reunited.\nNakache eventually moved to Buchenwald, where he was released following liberation by American troops in 1945. Afterward, he returned to swimming and continued to win competitions, and in 1948, he even competed in the Olympics in London.\nMiailhe met Nakache in person as a child, she tells Animation Magazine. “At the time, I was taking swimming lessons with his younger brother, William Nakache, and at every lesson, my father never failed to remind me: ‘You know, William, he’s the little brother of Alfred Nakache, the great swimming champion!'” One day, Alfred Nakache attended the lesson, and Miailhe got to demonstrate her butterfly stroke. But it wasn’t until years later, when her curiosity led her to research Nakache’s story, that she learned about what she presumed she had been too young to be told when she first met him.\nReferencing a historical story, Miailhe’s poignant rendering of Nakache’s memories and experiences is nevertheless prescient as the 2026 Winter Olympics have just kicked off. And just this past weekend, Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX Halftime Show quickly became fodder for partisan political discourse in the U.S.—the Puerto Rican pop star has been highly critical of ICE—highlighting the current administration’s nationalist, and even white supremacist, inclinations.\n\n“Papillon” was created using an animated painting technique, similar to Miailhe’s 2021 feature-length film Le Traversée, or The Crossing. Brushstrokes create both texture and depth as gestural swatches of blues and greens with white splotches indicate deep water with splashes or bubbles.\nNakache died shortly after swimming in a port just a few miles from where Miailhe used to swim when she was young. In addition to the personal connection, she continues in the interview with Animation Magazine: “It all seemed obvious to me: telling this story brought together many themes that are dear to me—resilience, transmission, memory, but also political issues, such as the fate of a Jewish swimmer facing adversity.”\nSee the film in its entirety on YouTube.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

For his extraordinary work at the unique intersection of cultural preservation and military service, he has been awarded the 2026 Marica Vilcek Prize in Art History. “Just as one case closes, another opens,” he notes, but does not seem deterred by the endless onslaught of cases to solve.  “History warns us worse is coming,” Bogdanos says. “Once you erase a people’s historical identity, the next step is to erase the people themselves.”Bogdanos’s passion for cultural heritage began early in life. At age 12, his mother, then a waitress in the family’s Greek restaurant in Lower Manhattan, gave him a copy of Homer's Iliad, which sparked a lifelong devotion to antiquity. In 1980, he earned a bachelor’s degree in classical studies from Bucknell University, enrolling in the military while still a first-year student. He then went on to complete a master’s degree in strategic studies from the United States Army War College, and a law degree and master’s degree in classical studies from Columbia University.In April 2003, Bogdanos led a multiagency recovery team into the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, where thousands of antiquities, including the 4,500-year-old hammered gold helmet of King Meksalamdug, had been looted during the invasion. His investigation recovered more than 9,000 pieces from eight countries, and he received the 2005 National Humanities Medal for this work. Bogdanos documented his findings in the book Thieves of Baghdad (with William Patrick), donating all royalties to the Iraq Museum. Since returning to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in 2010, his unit has recovered more than 6,100 antiquities, totaling more than $480 million, stolen from Greece, Italy, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nepal, Thailand, and beyond. Bogdanos’s advocacy has influenced international policy, including UN Security Council Resolution 2199, which recognized antiquities trafficking as a source of terrorist funding. He maintains his mission to combat the illicit trade that threatens both cultural heritage and global security.The Marica Vilcek Prize in Art History honors art historians, curators, and fine arts professionals whose work has a profound impact on their institutions, in their scholarship, and on arts and culture in general.To learn more, visit vilcek.org.\n                  \n                      \n                        Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Sponsored\n                      \n                      \n                        Awards\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, Nature |   \tJanuary 2nd, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn 1991, the French hus­band-and-wife vol­ca­nol­o­gist-film­mak­er team Mau­rice and Katia Krafft were killed by the flow of ash from the erup­tion of Mount Unzen in Nagasa­ki. Inex­plic­a­bly, Wern­er Her­zog did­n’t get around to mak­ing a film about them for more than 30 years. These would seem to be ide­al sub­jects for the doc­u­men­tary half of his career, a large por­tion of which he’s spent on por­traits of eccen­tric, roman­tic, often fool­hardy, and more than occa­sion­al­ly ill-fat­ed indi­vid­u­als who pit them­selves, or in any case find them­selves pit­ted, against the raw ele­ments of nature. Their cou­ple­hood makes the Kraffts a slight excep­tion in that line­up, but it also makes them even less resistible to a more con­ven­tion­al doc­u­men­tar­i­an — not that a doc­u­men­tar­i­an could get much less con­ven­tion­al than Her­zog.\nHence, per­haps, the appear­ance of two entire­ly sep­a­rate doc­u­men­taries on the Kraffts in the same year, 2022: Her­zog’s The Fire With­in, and Sara Dosa’s Fire of Love. The Like Sto­ries of Old video above per­forms a direct com­par­i­son of the two films, both of which make heavy use of the vol­cano footage shot by the Kraffts them­selves.\nHer­zog assem­bles it into word­less, oper­at­i­cal­ly scored, and some­times quite long sequences, inten­si­fy­ing their qual­i­ty of the sub­lime, which we feel in that aes­thet­ic zone where awe of beau­ty and fear of exis­ten­tial anni­hi­la­tion over­lap com­plete­ly. These do noth­ing to advance a nar­ra­tive, but every­thing to put forth what Her­zog has often referred to in inter­views as a sense of “ecsta­t­ic truth,” a dis­til­la­tion of real­i­ty that can­not be cap­tured by any con­ven­tion­al doc­u­men­tary means.\nThe video’s host Tom van der Lin­den describes Fire of Love as “much more fast-paced. Images come and go so quick­ly that they don’t real­ly have a chance to reveal that strange, secret beau­ty, to take the spot­light with their own mys­te­ri­ous star­dom. Instead, they feel sub­servient to what­ev­er pre­de­ter­mined emo­tion the nar­ra­tive wants you to expe­ri­ence,” as if the direc­tor is giv­ing you orders: “Be in awe. Feel the romance. And now the com­e­dy.” That hard­ly sug­gests incom­pe­tence on the part of Dosa and her col­lab­o­ra­tors, or any defi­cien­cy in her high­ly acclaimed film. But it does give us a sense of what becomes weary­ing about the tech­niques of main­stream cin­e­ma in gen­er­al, fic­tion­al, or non­fic­tion­al. The truth is that Wern­er Her­zog may be unique­ly well placed to appre­ci­ate not just the fear­some­ly enrap­tur­ing object of the Kraffts’ obses­sion, but also the dri­ving pas­sion, and flash­es of ridicu­lous­ness, in the Kraffts them­selves — who were, after all, fel­low sol­diers of cin­e­ma.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Dream-Dri­ven Film­mak­ing of Wern­er Her­zog: Watch the Video Essay, “The Inner Chron­i­cle of What We Are: Under­stand­ing Wern­er Her­zog”\nAn Intro­duc­tion to the Paint­ing of Cas­par David Friedrich, Roman­ti­cism & the Sub­lime\nWatch the Destruc­tion of Pom­peii by Mount Vesu­vius, Re-Cre­at­ed with Com­put­er Ani­ma­tion (79 AD)\nUnder­wa­ter Vol­canic Erup­tion Wit­nessed for the First Time\nTwo Ways To Shoot The Same Scene: A Com­par­i­son of The Shop Around the Cor­ner (1940) and You’ve Got Mail (1998) Shows How Film­mak­ing Changed Over the Decades\nWern­er Her­zog Dis­cov­ers the Ecsta­sy of Skate­board­ing: “That’s Kind of My Peo­ple”\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Uncategorized |   \tJanuary 2nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEspres­so is nei­ther bean nor roast.\nIt is a method of pres­sur­ized cof­fee brew­ing that ensures speedy deliv­ery, and it has birthed a whole cul­ture.\nAmer­i­cans may be accus­tomed to camp­ing out in cafes with their lap­tops for hours, but Ital­ian cof­fee bars are fast-paced envi­ron­ments where cus­tomers buzz in for a quick pick-me-up, then head right back out, no seat required.\nIt’s the sort of effi­cien­cy the Father of the Mod­ern Adver­tis­ing Poster, Leonet­to Cap­piel­lo, allud­ed to in his famous 1922 image for the Vic­to­ria Arduino machine (below).\nLet 21st-cen­tu­ry cof­fee afi­ciona­dos cul­ti­vate their Zen-like patience with slow pourovers. A hun­dred years ago, the goal was a qual­i­ty prod­uct that the suc­cess­ful busi­nessper­son could enjoy with­out break­ing stride.\n\nAs cof­fee expert James Hoff­mann, author of The World Atlas of Cof­fee points out in the above video, the Steam Age was on the way out, but Cappiello’s image is “absolute­ly lever­ag­ing the idea that steam equals speed.”\nThat had been the goal since 1884, when inven­tor Ange­lo Morion­do patent­ed the first espres­so machine (see below).\nThe bulk brew­er caused a stir at the Turin Gen­er­al Expo­si­tion. Speed wise, it was a great improve­ment over the old method, in which indi­vid­ual cups were brewed in the Turk­ish style, requir­ing five min­utes per order.\nThis “new steam machin­ery for the eco­nom­ic and instan­ta­neous con­fec­tion of cof­fee bev­er­age” fea­tured a gas or wood burn­er at the bot­tom of an upright boil­er, and two sight glass­es that the oper­a­tor could mon­i­tor to get a feel for when to open the var­i­ous taps, to yield a large quan­ti­ty of fil­tered cof­fee. It was fast, but demand­ed some skill on the part of its human oper­a­tor.\n\nAs Jim­my Stamp explains in a Smith­son­ian arti­cle on the his­to­ry of the espres­so machine, there were  also a few bugs to work out.\nEar­ly machines’ hand-oper­at­ed pres­sure valves posed a risk to work­ers, and the cof­fee itself had a burnt taste.\nMilanese café own­er Achille Gag­gia cracked the code after WWII, with a small, steam­less lever-dri­ven machine that upped the pres­sure to pro­duce the con­cen­trat­ed brew that is what we now think of as espres­so.\nStamp describes how Gaggia’s machine also stan­dard­ized the size of the espres­so, giv­ing rise to some now-famil­iar cof­fee­house vocab­u­lary:\nThe cylin­der on lever groups could only hold an ounce of water, lim­it­ing the vol­ume that could be used to pre­pare an espres­so. With the lever machines also came some new jar­gon: baris­tas oper­at­ing Gaggia’s spring-loaded levers coined the term “pulling a shot” of espres­so. But per­haps most impor­tant­ly, with the inven­tion of the high-pres­sure lever machine came the dis­cov­ery of cre­ma – the foam float­ing over the cof­fee liq­uid that is the defin­ing char­ac­ter­is­tic of a qual­i­ty espres­so. A his­tor­i­cal anec­dote claims that ear­ly con­sumers were dubi­ous of this “scum” float­ing over their cof­fee until Gag­gia began refer­ring to it as “caffe creme,“ sug­gest­ing that the cof­fee was of such qual­i­ty that it pro­duced its own creme.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2021.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nCof­fee Entre­pre­neur Rena­to Bialet­ti Gets Buried in the Espres­so Mak­er He Made Famous\nThe Life & Death of an Espres­so Shot in Super Slow Motion\nThe Bialet­ti Moka Express: The His­to­ry of Italy’s Icon­ic Cof­fee Mak­er, and How to Use It the Right Way\nEvery­thing You Ever Want­ed to Know about the Bialet­ti Moka Express: A Deep Dive Into Italy’s Most Pop­u­lar Cof­fee Mak­er\nAyun Hal­l­i­day is an author, illus­tra­tor, and the­ater mak­er in NYC.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen furniture maker Terry Facey began repairing historical pieces, his work often centered around 17th-century examples, thanks to an antique dealer who regularly brought him new items. Over time, the practice instilled a love for the beauty and precise craftsmanship of these centuries-old objects. And one day, he decided to try making one himself—only his iteration was really, really small.\nFacey works out of his shed, set up much the same as any other wood shop, except that everything is optimized for making scale miniatures. Recently, the V&A commissioned him to replicate an ornate, 17th-century table in its permanent collection at 1:8 scale. “It’s a piece that I’ve always loved,” Facey says. “It’s got the most wonderful barley twist legs, lovely inlay top with olive wood on six-sided pieces. It’s quite unique. I don’t usually see pieces with that configuration of veneer.”\n\n\n\nTo begin, Facey takes measurements of the original c.1674 marquetry table at the V&A in London Kensington. He then forages for twigs straight enough for carving an itty bitty version, and salvages 300-year-old oak from an old drawer because the old-growth wood has a grain that’s tighter, sturdier, and easier to work with than the modern oak one can buy at a home store, for example. “The old oak in this (drawer) is so fantastic,” Facey says. “To be able to use this as opposed to modern oak is just chalk and cheese.”\nArmed with chisels and saws that are very sharp and fine, Facey meticulously cuts dovetail joints and carves the replica twisted legs on a tiny lathe. He creates the tabletop from slices of the foraged twigs, reveling in the patterns that emerge from inside a seemingly unimpressive branch. Even tinier pieces are sliced from the heartwood to recreate the six-sided veneer pieces.\nFacey’s construction sheds light on the intricate process of furniture building, especially the art of elaborate veneer, no matter the scale. He says, “The olive wood table in the V&A, the fella who made it—or the people who made it, because they’re probably more than one—they used almost identical techniques [to] the techniques that I’ve used.”\nSee the video, and more like it, on the V&A’s YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

In a well-lit performance, Christian worship painter Vanessa Horabuena began the portrait with a bright-yellow cross and ambidextrous brush strokes as a cover of “Hallelujah” and other religious music played in the background.“There’s a young lady named Vanessa who’s one of the greatest artists anywhere in the world,” Trump reportedly told the audience. “She can paint, slowly, a beautiful portrait for the White House, or she can paint the most incredible painting in literally 10 minutes.” It is unclear what he was referring to regarding a White House portrait, but Trump replaced a depiction of President Barack Obama with a painting portraying his assassination attempt last year. At the time, Trump had not announced the name of the artist who created the replacement portrait. The president, during the New Year’s Eve performance, went on to say the artist “has done portraits” of him in the White House, and that he had “replaced a lot of people with those portraits.” The final product was a fair-skinned, light-eyed figure resembling an AI-generated rendition of the Shroud of Turin, which Trump described as “amazing.” “If I wanted a portrait I would call Vanessa,” Trump remarked to his wealthy audience.Before the bidding commenced, Trump called out to his sons, Donald and Eric, to name their favorite charities, reportedly announcing that the proceeds of the sale would go to the sheriff’s department and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Trump did not specify the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department, which has assisted the Secret Service in the president’s security. The final bid of just under $3 million came from an unnamed couple, a drastic price increase from the $15,000–$40,000 Horabuena usually sells her devotional works for.Also on New Year’s Eve, the White House projected the number \"250\" and red, white and blue shapes onto the Washington Monument to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. Similar projections will be shown nightly through January 5. The White House has repeatedly referenced the country’s 250th birthday in communications with the Smithsonian in its attempts to alter the telling of history in its exhibitions this year. In some ways, auctioning off a painting of Jesus for millions of dollars is perfectly in line with Trump’s penchant for leaning on religion when it suits him. Some religious commentators and figures have rejected Trump’s policies and actions, including mass deportations, as opposed to Christian values.Hyperallergic has reached out to Horabuena for comment. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Much ink has been spilled over Wojnarowicz’s work as a visual and performance artist, writer, and, of course, queer activist during the AIDS epidemic. But the Leslie-Lohman Museum’s new catalog, corresponding to its exhibition focusing on Wojnarowicz’s nearly 500-photograph Arthur Rimbaud in New York project, takes on particular resonance today, in an age of growing authoritarianism. Earlier this fall, federal immigration agents — masked to avoid identification — stormed Lower Manhattan in an unexpected raid, not too far from the museum. In the past few years, a whole fashion aesthetic dubbed stealth wear has sprung up, designed to resist government and corporate surveillance, including the constant presence of CCTV cameras.Rimbaud died in 1891. Unexpectedly, years later, the New York Downtown arts scene and discontented youth elsewhere rediscovered Rimbaud’s transgressive poetry and held him up as a luminary of sorts; at one point, writer and artist Dennis Cooper even held a Rimbaud “live-alike” contest. Beyond Rimbaud’s writings, Wojnarowicz likely saw himself in Rimbaud’s life, too — both men were young, queer runaways. But as critic Craig Dworkin writes in his contribution to the catalog, “On the Riverbank,” Wojnarowicz’s use of Rimbaud as a symbol was broad and uncompromising in its sweep — a protest “not just against the corporation or the state, but against the state of the world.” David Wojnarowicz, \"Arthur Rimbaud in New York (Times Square)\" (1978–79), silver printAntonio Sergio Bessa, who also curated the show, writes in his contribution to the catalog that Wojnarowicz transforms “the figure of Rimbaud into a mask of youth which anyone can identify with.” In doing so, Wojnarowicz “removed himself from the picture, so to speak, thus allowing the viewer to merge with the subject.” The current political climate asks us to take that contradiction — and Bessa’s thesis about self-removal — even further. Wojnarowicz, and anyone who cares to resist problematic power structures, should seriously consider removing themselves as a form of resistance. Certainly, the most direct way to remove one’s likeness from the surveillance state is to literally mask, maybe to pick up some stealth wear. But removal as political resistance goes beyond that. It calls for a refusal to engage in situations that take up time and energy better used elsewhere. As artists like Jenny Odell have written, doing “nothing” is a way of resisting oppressive forces, too. It calls for creativity.In her essay “Our Rimbaud Mask,” writer Anna Vitale notes elliptically that “Wojnarowicz’s Rimbaud both represents and reflects while also sabotaging reflection.” Indeed, Wojnarowicz’s use of Rimbaud reflects his specific time period and represents what artists from that era stood for — among other things, expanding formal boundaries and pushing for LGBTQ+ rights. But Wojnarowicz’s use of a mask also sabotages reflection. As Bessa writes, it “merges” the viewer and the subject. By reflecting and obscuring at once, Wojnarowicz reminds us how, in a world where governmental and corporate surveillance often blur into one another, we have to be innovative and unexpected in our resistance. This might look like traditional protesting, or preventing ICE raids before they begin, or continuing to make art in the face of institutional violence. Whichever ways we choose to resist, I think Wojnarowicz and Rimbaud would approve. David Wojnarowicz, \"Rimbaud in New York (diner)\" (1978–79), silver printDavid Wojnarowicz: Arthur Rimbaud in New York (2025), edited by Antonio Sergio Bessa, is available for purchase online and in bookstores.

Look, I know New Year’s resolutions are a cliché, but I want to share mine with you: This year, I’m going to finish my thesis. I completed coursework for my master’s degree in Art History years ago and wrote about half of my thesis before letting other projects, and plain old exhaustion, push it down the priority list. This made me feel guilty, and the guilt became another deterrent. Every time I sat down to write, a sense of shame loomed over the work ahead like a slowly expanding ink blot. Any writer or artist will know this feeling quite well. Yet we find a way to keep going.This week, Hyperallergic’s reporters and contributors authored pieces that spoke to resilience and momentum, like critic Seph Rodney’s moving review of a Hew Locke exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art. In Locke’s suspended sculptures of vessels, loaded with cargo as though “plucked from the sea mid-journey,” Rodney sees how vestiges of the past carry into the present. The show, he writes, “is about transitions, movement, both to and from what we might recognize as our home shores.”We also looked back at a legacy and found insights for the future. Spanish artist Cecilia Giménez, who died this week at 94, left not just the world’s most beloved botched restoration, but also the remarkable lesson that what might seem like a mistake could turn into your life’s most beautiful surprise. That’s a bit of wisdom we can all lean into — including us thesis writers …And on we go.

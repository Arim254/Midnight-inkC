    "body": "\n\tin Life, Philosophy |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEach cul­ture has its own say­ings about the unique­ness and tran­sience of the present moment. In recent years, the Eng­lish-speak­ers have often found them­selves remind­ed, through the expres­sion “YOLO,” that they only live once. (The ques­tion of whether that should real­ly be “YLOO,” or “You Live Only Once,” we put aside for the time being.) In Japan, unsur­pris­ing­ly, one some­times hears a much more ven­er­a­ble equiv­a­lent: “ichi-go ichi‑e,” which some read­ers acquaint­ed with the Japan­ese lan­guage should be assured has noth­ing to do with straw­ber­ries, ichi­go. Rather, the say­ing’s under­ly­ing Chi­nese char­ac­ters (一期一会) can be trans­lat­ed as “one time, one meet­ing.”\nThe Bud­dhis­ti­cal­ly inflect­ed “ichi-go ichi‑e” is just one in the vast library of yoji­juku­go, high­ly con­densed apho­ris­tic expres­sions writ­ten with just four char­ac­ters. (Oth­er coun­tries with Chi­nese-influ­enced lan­guages have their ver­sions, includ­ing sajaseon­geo in Korea and chéngyǔ in Chi­na itself.) It descends, as the sto­ry goes, from a slight­ly longer say­ing favored by the six­teenth-cen­tu­ry tea mas­ter Sen no Rikyū, “ichi-go ni ichi-do” (一期に一度).\nOne must pay respects to the host of a tea cer­e­mo­ny because the meet­ing would only ever occur once — which, of course, it would, even if the cer­e­mo­ny was a reg­u­lar­ly sched­uled event. For we nev­er, to bor­row an ancient Greek take on this whole sub­ject, step into the same riv­er twice; no two events, sep­a­rat­ed in time, can ever tru­ly be iden­ti­cal.\n\n\n\t\n\nOne impli­ca­tion, as not­ed in the explana­to­ry videos above from the BBC and Einzel­gänger, is that we should savor what­ev­er moment we hap­pen to find our­selves in, how­ev­er imper­fect, because we won’t get a sec­ond chance to do so. And if it offers lit­tle or noth­ing to enjoy, we can find solace in the fact that its par­tic­u­lar dis­plea­sure, too, can nev­er revis­it us. With the past gone and the future nev­er guar­an­teed, the present moment, in any case, is the only time that actu­al­ly exists for us, so we’d bet­ter make our­selves com­fort­able with­in it. Though these ideas have per­haps found their most ele­gant and mem­o­rable expres­sion in Japan, they’re hard­ly con­sid­ered exclu­sive cul­tur­al prop­er­ty there.

    "body": "\n\tin Audio Books, Literature |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHav­ing not revis­it­ed The Hob­bit in some time, I’ve felt the famil­iar pull—shared by many readers—to return to Tolkien’s fairy-tale nov­el itself. It was my first expo­sure to Tolkien, and the per­fect book for a young read­er ready to dive into moral com­plex­i­ty and a ful­ly-real­ized fic­tion­al world.\nAnd what bet­ter guide could there be through The Hob­bit than Tolkien him­self, read­ing (above) from the 1937 work? In this 1952 record­ing in two parts (part 2 is below), the ven­er­a­ble fan­ta­sist and schol­ar reads from his own work for the first time on tape.\nTolkien begins with a pas­sage that first describes the crea­ture Gol­lum; lis­ten­ing to this descrip­tion again, I am struck by how much dif­fer­ent­ly I imag­ined him when I first read the book. The Gol­lum of The Hob­bit seems some­how hoari­er and more mon­strous than many lat­er visu­al inter­pre­ta­tions. This is a minor point and not a crit­i­cism, but per­haps a com­ment on how nec­es­sary it is to return to the source of a myth­ic world as rich as Tolkien’s, even, or espe­cial­ly, when it’s been so well-real­ized in oth­er media. No one, after all, knows Mid­dle Earth bet­ter than its cre­ator.\n\n\n\t\n\nThese read­ings were part of a much longer record­ing ses­sion, dur­ing which Tolkien also read (and sang!) exten­sive­ly from The Lord of the Rings. A YouTube user has col­lect­ed, in sev­er­al parts, a radio broad­cast of that full ses­sion, and it’s cer­tain­ly worth your time to lis­ten to it all the way through. It’s also worth know­ing the neat con­text of the record­ing. Here’s the text that accom­pa­nies the video on YouTube:\nWhen Tolkien vis­it­ed a friend in August of 1952 to retrieve a man­u­script of The Lord of the Rings, he was shown a “tape recorder”. Hav­ing nev­er seen one before, he asked how it worked and was then delight­ed to have his voice record­ed and hear him­self played back for the first time. His friend then asked him to read from The Hob­bit, and Tolkien did so in this one incred­i­ble take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2012.\nRelat­ed Con­tent\nLis­ten to J.R.R.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nTopped with a roof shaped like a crabshell, Le Corbusier’s Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut is a sanctuary amid the French mountainside. The 1955 construction rests atop a hill in Ronchamp, standing unobstructed by the otherwise forested inclines. As the sun rises and falls, light filters in through the mélange of rectangular windows tinted to cast streams of color around the space.\nThe stained glass apertures of Le Corbusier’s modernist chapel are a clear reference point for Luftwerk’s “Open Frame.” The site-specific work fills a cavernous corner of Secrist | Beach with a collection of rectangular aluminum panels painted with acrylic and, most notably, fluorescent. Where the pioneering architect sought a natural backlight in the sun, Luftwerk relies on the properties of the paint to achieve a luminous glow. The only external source is a handful of strategically placed LED spotlights that bathe the entire installation in purple when in use.\nDetail of “Open Frame”\n“Open Frame” is one of the many pieces in the artists’ latest exhibition that extends their unyielding interest in light and color. The Sun Standing Still features a collection of sculptures and installations that harness the principles of color theory, explore space, and elicit various sensory experiences. The artists, Chicago-based Petra Bachmaier and Sean Gallero (previously), draw on the characteristics of sunlight as it broaches the horizon, cultivating a body of work that conjures luminosity through negative space and pigment.\nLong interested in perspective, Luftwerk presents several works that appear dramatically different depending on the viewer’s position. The Solargraph series, for example, references the long-duration images that capture the sun’s path between solstices. Stretching across the gallery, these works incorporate skinny, aluminum strips painted white on one side and bisected by various hues on the inverse. As the viewer moves, so does the perception of the piece, revealing an expanse of faintly tinted white before shifting to a bright arc of color.\nRelatedly, the freestanding Aperture of Twilight sculptures place five panels cut with differently sized openings eight inches apart. Painted on one side, the layers form a sort of portal or entrance, inviting a closer look. The circular Aurae Quartet pieces function similarly as they utilize concentric rings to capture a sense of movement inward or out.\nIf you’re in Chicago, you can see The Sun Standing Still through February 28. Find more from the artists on their website and Instagram.\n“Solargraph: Shortest Day” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 6 feet x 4.75 feet x 2 inches\n“Solargraph: Arc of Days” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 72 pieces, 6 feet x 27 feet x 6 inches\n“Aurae Quartet No. 1 ” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 33 inches in diameter, 3 inches in depth\n\n“Aurae Trio No. 1” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 26.375 inch diameter, 3 inches depth\nInstallation view of ‘The Sun Standing Still’\n“Aperture of Twilight: Dawn” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 5 layers, 33 x 33 inches each\n“Open Frame” (2025), aluminum, acrylic, and fluorescent paint, size variable\n“Open Frame” (2025), aluminum, acrylic, and fluorescent paint, size variable\n“Color Space No. 3” (2025), glass with film, 13 x 13 x 13 inches, edition of 3\nThe artists in their studio.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom a single material, a Hyderabad-based design studio creates a wide range of site-specific installations, furnishings, and decor. It’s all in the name of the firm, The Wicker Story, which was founded in 2019 by architect Priyanka Narula. Capable of being formed into everything from abstract constructions to functional objects, the natural material lends itself a huge variety of pieces that vary in size and complexity.\nWicker is a common technique used for basket-weaving and other applications in India, and The Wicker Story evolved out of a fascination with the geometry and math inherent in traditional Indian pieces. The material and process nods to a time-honored aesthetic while emphasizing organic forms, fluidity, and experimentation.\n“Flowering Vines”\nA swirling plane descending from a light fixture, a bean-shaped bench, and a bulbous floor lamp are just a couple of The Wicker Story’s woven creations. Botanicals often provide reference points, as abstracted petals and vine-like tendrils often complement the compositions.\nAfter refining the possibilities of the technique, including colorful dyes and a range of forms, the studio is honing a core collection that will continue to mature and grow. “We are currently translating those traditional wicker techniques into metal weaving; it’s a rigorous research-and-development process that we look forward to debuting fully next year,” the studio says.\nSee more on The Wicker Story’s website and Instagram.\n“Bark Bench”\nTWS x Seraspire lighting feature collaboration\n“Bark Lamp”\n“Imli Bench”\n“Flower” installation\n“Bow Bench 1”\n“Sunset Beach”\n“Bloom”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Using thin layers of sooty blacks, moody reds, dirty yellows, fiery oranges, and earthen browns, Rice depicted lone figures in compressed, smoldering settings, where inescapable isolation is his subject’s only companion. Bill Rice, the artist’s debut exhibition at the newly opened Donald Ryan Gallery, offers viewers a chance to reassess this inimitable and overlooked artist.   Of the exhibition’s 12 paintings, dating from 1973 to ’95, only “Purple Blow” (1995) has more than one figure. As the title conveys, Rice depicts two men about to engage in fellatio, one standing and the other kneeling, with his arms by his side. It is not immediately clear whether they are in a room beside a bed with dirty sheets or outside in an urban cul-de-sac. They are not touching, and there is no hint of passion. Rice repeatedly returned to this sense of alienation rather than intimacy (however fleeting) in his work. Bill Rice, \"Purple Blow\" (1995), oil on linenIn “Man” (1979), we see the back of a nude man as he looks down onto the streets below, his forearms resting on an iron railing. The thinly painted dark orange and orange-red rectangles on either side of him suggest something glowing below. Is it a sign of volcanic passion or a destructive conflagration that he is observing from a distance? The feeling of remoteness haunts Rice’s paintings. His images of men standing with their backs to the viewer suggest voyeurism, as if they’re looking at something we cannot see, but also heighten the sense of estrangement.For “Window Gate” (1980), Rice lays an open diamond grid over the windows’ subdued orange and umber rectangles and dirty gray and black walls. The space is compressed, as if the city’s anonymity is too much with us. By synthesizing aspects of abstraction and representation in the same painting, Rice anticipates the blurring of boundaries between the two in later paintings. His attraction to thinned-out dirty reds and gritty black shares some qualities with Mark Rothko’s abstractions without being derivative. Rice’s sharp painterly sensibility is apparent in his ability to absorb and restate aspects of other artists’ work, making it appear fresh and unique to his aesthetic. His use of blacks and grays to convey an urban mood is unrivaled. The paintings are paradoxes of bleakness and sensuality, gloom and intrepid spirits. They are testimonies to survival. Bill Rice, \"Silks\" (1984), oil on canvas.In “Silks” (1984), the faint reflection of a yellow cab in the window on one side of the recessed entryway and the man in a bright red hoodie and dark blue dungarees on the other side underscore a world of extreme isolation and missed connections. The red neon sign on the doorway seems to transform it into a portal to Dante’s hell.I see Rice, along with Martin Wong, as acutely attuned to the denizens of Manhattan’s devastated, plucky Lower East Side before it became gentrified and hardened. When the New Museum reopens in early 2026, it ought to dedicate a room to these astute, sympathetic observers of an artistic and cultural ethos that was devastated by AIDS and the US government’s genocidal policy of denial and indifference. Bill Rice, \"Window Gate\" (1980), oil on canvasBill Rice continues at Donald Ryan Gallery (15 East 71st Street, 2A, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through January 10. The exhibition was organized by the gallery.\n                  \n                      \n                        Art Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Bill Rice\n                      \n                      \n                        Donald Ryan Gallery\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

After all, museums are among our nation's most trusted institution — no small feat in an era of post-truth partisanship. Weine's piece pairs beautifully with Seph Rodney's thoughtful review of the work of Hew Locke, who reckons with the ramifications of nation-building in his survey exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art.

Stars, maybe, but what immediately came to mind for me were two other possibilities--children looking for Santa Claus's sleigh, and children in or near a war zone looking for missiles and drones. The contrast is heartbreaking.I also remembered going outside in the late 1950s with my parents to look for Sputnik (its rocket) as it passed overhead. I've spent many a crick-necked hour hoping to see a murmuration of starlings. Other birds also. Double rainbows. Clouds. On Halloween nights, we looked for (and looked out for) witches. And in December, the Star in the East.From the ArchiveThe \"Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room\" at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC, assembled by Alice S.

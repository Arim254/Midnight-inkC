    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage by Bernd Schwabe, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nAt least when I was in grade school, we learned the very basics of how the Third Reich came to pow­er in the ear­ly 1930s. Para­mil­i­tary gangs ter­ror­iz­ing the oppo­si­tion, the incom­pe­tence and oppor­tunism of Ger­man con­ser­v­a­tives, the Reich­stag Fire. And we learned about the crit­i­cal impor­tance of pro­pa­gan­da, the delib­er­ate mis­in­form­ing of the pub­lic in order to sway opin­ions en masse and achieve pop­u­lar sup­port (or at least the appear­ance of it). While Min­is­ter of Pro­pa­gan­da Joseph Goebbels purged Jew­ish and left­ist artists and writ­ers, he built a mas­sive media infra­struc­ture that played, writes PBS, “prob­a­bly the most impor­tant role in cre­at­ing an atmos­phere in Ger­many that made it pos­si­ble for the Nazis to com­mit ter­ri­ble atroc­i­ties against Jews, homo­sex­u­als, and oth­er minori­ties.”\nHow did the minor­i­ty par­ty of Hitler and Goebbels take over and break the will of the Ger­man peo­ple so thor­ough­ly that they would allow and par­tic­i­pate in mass mur­der? Post-war schol­ars of total­i­tar­i­an­ism like Theodor Adorno and Han­nah Arendt asked that ques­tion over and over, for sev­er­al decades after­ward. Their ear­li­est stud­ies on the sub­ject looked at two sides of the equa­tion. Adorno con­tributed to a mas­sive vol­ume of social psy­chol­o­gy called The Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty, which stud­ied indi­vid­u­als pre­dis­posed to the appeals of total­i­tar­i­an­ism. He invent­ed what he called the F‑Scale (“F” for “fas­cism”), one of sev­er­al mea­sures he used to the­o­rize the Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Type.\nArendt, on the oth­er hand, looked close­ly at the regimes of Hitler and Stal­in and their func­tionar­ies, at the ide­ol­o­gy of sci­en­tif­ic racism, and at the mech­a­nism of pro­pa­gan­da in fos­ter­ing “a curi­ous­ly vary­ing mix­ture of gulli­bil­i­ty and cyn­i­cism with which each mem­ber… is expect­ed to react to the chang­ing lying state­ments of the lead­ers.” So she wrote in her 1951 Ori­gins of Total­i­tar­i­an­ism, going on to elab­o­rate that this “mix­ture of gulli­bil­i­ty and cyn­i­cism… is preva­lent in all ranks of total­i­tar­i­an move­ments”:\nIn an ever-chang­ing, incom­pre­hen­si­ble world the mass­es had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe every­thing and noth­ing, think that every­thing was pos­si­ble and noth­ing was true… The total­i­tar­i­an mass lead­ers based their pro­pa­gan­da on the cor­rect psy­cho­log­i­cal assump­tion that, under such con­di­tions, one could make peo­ple believe the most fan­tas­tic state­ments one day, and trust that if the next day they were giv­en irrefutable proof of their false­hood, they would take refuge in cyn­i­cism; instead of desert­ing the lead­ers who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the state­ment was a lie and would admire the lead­ers for their supe­ri­or tac­ti­cal clev­er­ness.\nWhy the con­stant, often bla­tant lying? For one thing, it func­tioned as a means of ful­ly dom­i­nat­ing sub­or­di­nates, who would have to cast aside all their integri­ty to repeat out­ra­geous false­hoods and would then be bound to the leader by shame and com­plic­i­ty. “The great ana­lysts of truth and lan­guage in pol­i­tics”—writes McGill Uni­ver­si­ty polit­i­cal phi­los­o­phy pro­fes­sor Jacob T. Levy—includ­ing “George Orwell, Han­nah Arendt, Vaclav Havel—can help us rec­og­nize this kind of lie for what it is.… Say­ing some­thing obvi­ous­ly untrue, and mak­ing your sub­or­di­nates repeat it with a straight face in their own voice, is a par­tic­u­lar­ly star­tling dis­play of pow­er over them. It’s some­thing that was endem­ic to total­i­tar­i­an­ism.”\nArendt and oth­ers rec­og­nized, writes Levy, that “being made to repeat an obvi­ous lie makes it clear that you’re pow­er­less.” She also rec­og­nized the func­tion of an avalanche of lies to ren­der a pop­u­lace pow­er­less to resist, the phe­nom­e­non we now refer to as “gaslight­ing”:\nThe result of a con­sis­tent and total sub­sti­tu­tion of lies for fac­tu­al truth is not that the lie will now be accept­ed as truth and truth be defamed as a lie, but that the sense by which we take our bear­ings in the real world—and the cat­e­go­ry of truth ver­sus false­hood is among the men­tal means to this end—is being destroyed. \nThe epis­te­mo­log­i­cal ground thus pulled out from under them, most would depend on what­ev­er the leader said, no mat­ter its rela­tion to truth. “The essen­tial con­vic­tion shared by all ranks,” Arendt con­clud­ed, “from fel­low trav­el­er to leader, is that pol­i­tics is a game of cheat­ing and that the ‘first com­mand­ment’ of the move­ment: ‘The Fuehrer is always right,’ is as nec­es­sary for the pur­pos­es of world pol­i­tics, i.e., world-wide cheat­ing, as the rules of mil­i­tary dis­ci­pline are for the pur­pos­es of war.”\nArendt wrote Ori­gins of Total­i­tar­i­an­ism from research and obser­va­tions gath­ered dur­ing the 1940s, a very spe­cif­ic his­tor­i­cal peri­od. Nonethe­less the book, Jef­frey Isaacs remarks at The Wash­ing­ton Post, “rais­es a set of fun­da­men­tal ques­tions about how tyran­ny can arise and the dan­ger­ous forms of inhu­man­i­ty to which it can lead.” Arendt’s analy­sis of pro­pa­gan­da and the func­tion of lies seems par­tic­u­lar­ly rel­e­vant at this moment. The kinds of bla­tant lies she wrote of might become so com­mon­place as to become banal. We might begin to think they are an irrel­e­vant sideshow. This, she sug­gests, would be a mis­take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAre You a Fas­cist?: Take Theodor Adorno’s Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Test Cre­at­ed to Com­bat Fas­cism (1947)\nUmber­to Eco’s List of the 14 Com­mon Fea­tures of Fas­cism\nThe Sto­ry of Fas­cism: Rick Steves’ Doc­u­men­tary Helps Us Learn from the Painful Lessons of the 20th Cen­tu­ry\nHan­nah Arendt on “Per­son­al Respon­si­bil­i­ty Under Dic­ta­tor­ship:” Bet­ter to Suf­fer Than Col­lab­o­rate\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Archaeology, Art, History |   \tJanuary 26th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImage by Ahdi Agus Okta­viana\nOver the cen­turies, a vari­ety of places have laid cred­i­ble claim to being the world’s art cen­ter: Con­stan­tino­ple, Flo­rence, Paris, New York. But on the scale of, say, ten mil­len­nia, the hot spots become rather less rec­og­niz­able. Up until about 20,000 years ago, it seems that cre­ators and view­ers of art alike spent a good deal in one par­tic­u­lar cave: Liang Metan­duno, locat­ed on Muna Island in Indone­si­a’s South­east Sulawe­si province. The many paint­ings on its walls of rec­og­niz­able humans, ani­mals, and boats have brought it fame in our times as a kind of ancient art gallery. But in recent years, a much old­er piece of work has been dis­cov­ered there, one whose cre­ation occurred at least 67,800 years ago.\nThe cre­ation in ques­tion is a hand­print, faint but detectable, prob­a­bly made by blow­ing a mix­ture of ochre and water over an actu­al human hand. To deter­mine its age, researchers per­formed what’s called ura­ni­um-series analy­sis on the deposits of cal­ci­um car­bon­ate that had built up on and around it.\nThe num­ber of 67,800 years is, of course, not exact, but it’s also just a min­i­mum: in fact, the hand­print could well be much old­er. In a paper pub­lished last week in Nature, the researchers point out that its age exceeds both that of the old­est sim­i­lar rock art found else­where in Indone­sia and that of a hand sten­cil in Spain attrib­uted to Nean­derthals, “which until now rep­re­sent­ed the old­est demon­strat­ed min­i­mum-age con­straint for cave art world­wide.”\nIt isn’t impos­si­ble that this at least 67,800-year-old hand­print could also have been made by Nean­derthals. The obvi­ous mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the hand’s shape, how­ev­er, an exten­sion and taper­ing of the fin­gers that brings to mind ani­mal claws (or the clutch­es of Nos­fer­atu), sug­gests to cer­tain sci­en­tif­ic eyes the kind of cog­ni­tion attrib­ut­able specif­i­cal­ly to Homo sapi­ens. This dis­cov­ery has great poten­tial rel­e­vance not just to art his­to­ry, but even more so to oth­er fields con­cerned with the devel­op­ment of our species. While it had pre­vi­ous­ly been thought, for instance, that the first human set­tlers of Aus­tralia made their way there through Indone­sia (in a time of much low­er sea lev­els) between 50,000 and 65,000 years ago, the hand­print­’s exis­tence in Liang Metan­duno sug­gests that the migra­tion took place even ear­li­er. All these mil­len­nia lat­er, Aus­tralia remains a favored des­ti­na­tion for a vari­ety of immi­grants — some of whom do their part to keep Syd­ney’s art scene inter­est­ing.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAlger­ian Cave Paint­ings Sug­gest Humans Did Mag­ic Mush­rooms 9,000 Years Ago\nWas a 32,000-Year-Old Cave Paint­ing the Ear­li­est Form of Cin­e­ma?\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er the World’s First “Art Stu­dio” Cre­at­ed in an Ethiopi­an Cave 43,000 Years Ago\nA Recent­ly Dis­cov­ered 44,000-Year-Old Cave Paint­ing Tells the Old­est Known Sto­ry\n40,000-Year-Old Sym­bols Found in Caves World­wide May Be the Ear­li­est Writ­ten Lan­guage\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er 200,000-Year-Old Hand & Foot­prints That Could Be the World’s Ear­li­est Cave Art\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe wealthy in society have been known to spare no expense when it comes to building palatial residences with impressively high-ceilinged rooms and enviable art collections. Visits to U.K. National Trust properties like Attingham Park in Shropshire and other historic estates serve as reminders of aristocratic obsessions with opulence and legacy, with their soaring ceilings and salon-style installations of portraits in wallpapered halls. But then, there’s also something ineffably satisfying about a room in miniature.\nFor Gretchen Scherer, centuries-old rooms in grand houses and institutions serve as the foundation for an ongoing series of paintings of luminous interiors. She starts with photos sourced online, from books, and that she snaps herself, in addition to drawing inspiration from artists like Narcissa Niblack Thorne, who commissioned meticulously crafted miniatures of period rooms to house her vast collection of 1:12-scale furniture. Scherer then tries to “open up” the space, as she describes it, toying a bit with perspective.\n“Royal Academy of Art, Life Drawing Room” (2025), oil and acrylic on panel, 18 x 24 inches\nScherer’s solo show Reading the Rooms, which opens next month at Richard Heller Gallery, adds to her repertoire of historic locations, such as U.K. National Trust properties and other European landmarks and museums. “In my work, there’s always been a tension between real life and the imagined,” she says in a statement. “Using places that are fixed and exist in the world, in a certain way, helps me to draw attention to this tension.”\nThe artist’s lively, illustrative paintings of historic rooms brim with paintings and period furnishings that transport us to earlier eras while emphasizing a bright, contemporary palette. Every object, be it a book, a candlestick, or a noble portrait above a mantle, is given equal attention, drawing our eye around the canvas like a two-dimensional cabinet of curiosities. There’s so much going on that one can imagine miniature compositions within the larger one, as doorways open up to further rooms and furniture is arranged around art displays.\n“All the little paintings, sculptures, and furniture within the painting come from the actual collection and become the animated elements in an otherwise empty space,” Scherer says. “Some of the paintings in this show feel more empty and breathless and others feel very alive and playful. I think they oscillate between those two poles.”\nReading the Rooms opens February 21 and continues through March 21 in Santa Monica.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nStarting with the inherently gridded layouts of LEGO baseplates,  Katherine Duclos creates vibrant, undulating compositions of pastels and gradients. The Vancouver-based artist employs the colorful bricks in a variety of geometric patterns and low-relief textures to achieve dynamic compositions that appear almost kinetic, adding her own effects with paint. The impression of movement, paired with the tactility of the toy pieces, transforms a familiar object we typically associate with childlike play into a elegant assemblages cradled in wood panels.\nA large-scale, participatory exhibition of new work by Duclos, including a couple of LEGO pieces, marks the first presentation of the new ACT Arts Centre in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. The compositions you see here go on view in Grid Memories at Heron Arts in San Francisco alongside works by Alexis Arnold, Gina Borg, and Kim Bennett, running from January 31 to March 5. And she’s currently working toward another interactive show slated for June in Sweden, during which visitors will be able to interact with Duclos’ LEGO pieces.

While it sets out to rescue Berthe Morisot from a long-held assumption that she owed her art to the influence — even guidance — of Édouard Manet, the show is far from an academic or revisionist experience. Instead, after seeing their work compared and contrasted across a handful of galleries, the word that comes most immediately to mind is “pleasure.” That Manet could really paint is no surprise. He’s sometimes called the “father of Modernism,” a figure at least as pivotal as Cézanne. The surprise here is how much Morisot’s work holds its own alongside his, and how much Manet understood that himself.The two first met in the mid-1860s at the Louvre, where artists often made copies after works in the collection. Berthe was there with her older sister, Edma, also an artist, accompanied by their mother as their necessary chaperone. (As a man, Manet did not, of course, require a chaperone.) Though he was married, nearly a decade her senior, and already known for scandalous paintings — see “Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe\" and “Olympia” (both 1863) — they struck up a friendship. By 1868, Morisot had posed as the brooding central figure in Manet’s large canvas, “The Balcony” (1868). It’s likely at this point that she gets cast as his student and his muse.Édouard Manet, “The Balcony” (1868-69), oil on canvasMorisot was a formidable, compelling figure, and Manet was clearly compelled by her. In “The Balcony,” Morisot’s dark hair, brows, and intensely focused gaze are a dramatic counterpoint to her feathery white dress, closed fan clasped in her pale hands, and the little dog at her feet. But though she may have been something of a muse early on, she was never Manet’s student, and in fact reacted with fury when he once “corrected” something in one of her paintings.Morisot is, here, overshadowed by Manet, not just by numbers — the first gallery has seven paintings of her by him, with just two by Morisot — but by the sheer size of a canvas like “The Balcony,” around five feet seven inches high (~170 cm). Morisot’s “Young Woman at Her Window” (1869), hanging nearby and done soon after Manet’s painting, feels slight in comparison at less than two feet high (~61cm). In it, her sister Edma is depicted in a similar white dress, also holding a fan, but one she is examining open in her lap; the view is from inside the room rather than from the street. This might traditionally be considered a woman’s view, rather than a man’s. Indeed, while Manet's figures so often stare frankly outward, engaging the viewer, Morisot's nearly always look down, away, or into the painting itself — contemplating rather than confronting the world, with a touch of inward moodiness.Morisot’s canvases are all mostly smaller than Manet’s — a result, no doubt, of both plein air portability and the proper sphere of women’s ambition, however conscious or unconscious. But they increasingly hold their own as the exhibition unfolds, a testament to her growth as an artist. She even proved an influence on Manet: His solid outlined figures become increasingly opened up into color and surrounding space, and his brushstrokes looser.Berthe Morisot, \"The Artist’s Sister at the Window\" (1869), oil on canvas (photo courtesy the Legion of Honor)Manet also influenced Morisot in ways that extended beyond her art — it seems he encouraged the relationship between she and his younger brother Eugène. It is much to her historical advantage that she did not professionally adopt her husband’s family name when they married in December 1874. Eugène was also an artist, one who both supported her career and served as her model. According to a wall label, he was “the only grown man who appears in her pictures.” And what a man. Morisot’s “Eugène Manet on the Isle of Wight” (1875) depicts her new husband on their honeymoon, seated at a window in a white jacket, looking out at the sea. Morisot wrote her sister, “Poor Eugène, who takes your place but is a less obliging model.” Yet he was obliging enough to appear in other works by his wife, including “Eugène and Julie Manet in the Garden at Bougival” (1881), where he balances a toy across his legs for their daughter to play with. It’s pleasant to see a 19th-century father and child together this way, a rarity in an Impressionist world filled with children outdoors with their nurses. Morisot’s portraits of Eugène offer a quiet modern ideal of attentive masculinity.Morisot’s power grows as the exhibition goes on, until after the death of Manet in 1883, and culminates in the show’s final painting, her “Self-Portrait” (1885). Morisot depicts herself as an artist at work, staring directly out of the canvas, rendered with loose gestural brushstrokes that are unmistakably hers. It’s a fitting bookend to the introductory gallery filled with canvases of Manet’s gaze trained on her. But at this point, I’m over any concerns around who influenced whom — I’m simply enjoying the great pleasure of paint.Berthe Morisot, “Self-Portrait” (1885), oil on canvasBerthe Morisot, “Eugène Manet on the Isle of Wight” (1875), oil on canvasBerthe Morisot, “Eugène and Julie Manet in the Garden at Bougival” (1881), oil on canvasAbove: Édouard Manet, “On the Beach at Boulogne-sur-Mer” (1869), oil on canvas; below: Berthe Morisot, “On the Beach at Petites-Dalles or Fécamp” (1873), oil on canvasÉdouard Manet, “Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets” (1872), oil on canvasManet & Morisot continues at the Legion of Honor (100 34th Avenue, San Francisco, California) through March 1.

    "body": "\n\tThe Louvre closed on Monday due to a strike as employees’ demands for improved working conditions and pay equity continue to go unmet, marking the fourth day the Paris museum has shuttered since mid-December. The stoppage is one of the longest strikes in the history of the world’s most visited museum, a crisis intensified by the October 19 burglary and related revelations of systemic security failures.\n\n\tAccording to Le Parisien, roughly 300 employees voted in a general assembly on Monday morning to extend the strike launched on December 15, following several fruitless negotiation sessions with the Ministry of Culture and Louvre management.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“What we need is political will to ensure that these pay gaps are compensated without delay,” said union representative Christian Galani in a statement quoted by Le Parisien, calling on French Culture Minister Rachida Dati to honor her word after publicly deeming the strikers’ demands “legitimate.” \n\n\tValérie Baud, representative of the union CFDT, told the publication that the management of the Louvre sent on a “first draft” of proposals on working conditions on Sunday, which staff deemed “insufficient.” \n\n\tThe Louvre’s roughly 2,200 employees have reportedly met every Monday since the protest began in general assemblies to decide whether to fully close the museum or partially open it to visitors. Workers staged a three-day walkout before Christmas, followed by several partial closures and delayed openings in early January. On January 5, the museum briefly reopened after a three-hour delay, though several galleries remained closed as workers later resumed strike action following a holiday pause.\n\n\tUnions representing Louvre employees say staff are overworked and that the museum is understaffed and poorly maintained, prompting calls for increased hiring, higher wages, and greater investment in infrastructure. The dispute has unfolded amid heightened scrutiny of the institution following an October daytime robbery in which thieves stole crown jewels valued at more than $100 million, most of which have not been recovered.\n\n\tWorkers have also raised concerns about the museum’s long-term redevelopment plans, including a proposed standalone gallery for Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Earlier this month, staff staged another walkout targeting the project, which unions described as unrealistic given the museum’s ongoing staffing shortages and maintenance issues. \n\t\n\n\tIn mid-January, the Louvre reported a loss of “at least one million euros” from a single two-hour delay in the museum’s opening.\n",

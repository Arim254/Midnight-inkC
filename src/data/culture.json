    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn his forthcoming solo exhibition, Building Identities Through Style, Glenn Hardy Jr. excavates the strata of fashion, especially how identities are shaped and perceived through appearance. \nBased in Washington, D.C., Hardy is a self-taught painter whose bold portraits emphasize Black life “liberated from the burdens of racial stereotypes and conflict,” says Charlie James Gallery, which is currently presenting the show. The figures in Hardy’s compositions often engage in everyday leisure activities or settle into places of refuge and camaraderie, like studios, athletic courts, and domestic spaces.\n“Mannequin | Cherry Blossoms” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 40 x 30 inches\nBuilding Identities Through Style emphasizes fashion as more than simply personal expression or “self-celebration,” as described in a statement. Hardy examines the complexities of garments, trends, and luxury through the lens of desire and access, juxtaposing elements of reality and fantasy—especially in a series of paintings of mannequins topped with realistic visages, like individual characters being pieced together as their tailored apparel takes shape.\nThe artist is interested in how sartorial choices nod to complex systems of negotiation and judgment that inform our understanding of conformity, difference, and a sense of belonging. “Hardy not only interrogates the manner in which Black bodies are seen and assessed, but also the ways in which stylistic excellence has become both reputational armor and a source of joy, experimentation, and play,” the gallery says.\n“Soar Thumb,” for example, portrays a group of men in an elevator, all but one of whom are dressed in nearly identical suits and sport short haircuts. The outlier is a tall individual with bold dreadlocks and a white tank top, standing confidently with his arms crossed and gazing directly at the viewer. \n“Soar Thumb” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 36 x 36 inches\nHardy frames the contrast not as an act of rebellion but as a means of parsing how, within a shared space, some find conformity to bring a sense of safety or comfort, while others view individual expression to be—in addition to its liberating nature—a kind of buffer or armor.\n“The suited figures are not antagonists but participants in the same system of social evaluation, using uniformity as protection,” says a statement. “The outlier is neither hero nor foil; he is exposed. The work asks not which presentation is more authentic, but what each form of visibility costs.”\nBuilding Identities Through Style continues through February 7 in Los Angeles. Find more on Hardy’s Instagram.\n“Untitled Portrait | Green” (2025), oil on linen, 24 x 20 inches\n“Chivalry” (2025), oil on linen, 30 x 30 inches\n“Red Scarf” (2025), oil on linen, 26 x 24 inches\n“Safe Space | Messy Studio” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 52 1/4 x 46 1/4 inches\n“Untitled | Mannequin Black” (2025), oil on linen, 22 x 16 1/2 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Traveling to the Okinawa prefecture in the hopes of encountering a scarcely documented species of larval goosefish, Kovacs spent nearly two weeks blackwater diving before photographing the rare moment. \n“Unfortunately, this beautiful little fish turned out to be incredibly uncooperative and difficult to photograph,” Kovacs says. “After spending some time with it, I was very fortunate that, for one brief moment, it decided to yawn while facing the camera.” The resulting image is aptly titled “Tired fish.”\nSteven Kovacs, “Tired Fish,” Kumejima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan\nThis past year, the annual contest saw thousands of entries spanning more than 90 countries. From silky sharks in Cuba to small pipefish in Indonesia, each photograph highlights unique, fleeting underwater moments that often go unseen. Awardees took home more than $60,000 in prizes, including once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as diving excursions, cruises, and liveaboard trips.\nTake a plunge into the online gallery of winning images, highlighting 14 distinctive categories.

The museum will remain closed through the weekend, a spokesperson confirmed.A museum visitor who asked to remain anonymous told Hyperallergic that staff instructed guests to leave the museum this afternoon, January 23, as water poured from the ceiling near the gift shop. “We saw a large pool of water on the floor near the entrance, and saw the water flowing down in the store,\" the visitor said. A spokesperson for the Studio Museum reached by Hyperallergic confirmed that a sprinkler was damaged during preparations for the upcoming storm and cold front, causing a flood in the gift shop below. No artworks or galleries were affected.”Because the incident impacted the adjacent entrance to the building, and in anticipation of the impending storm, the Museum will be closed to the public throughout the weekend,” the spokesperson said.\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                        0:00\n                            /0:10\n                        \n                        \n            \n            Video of the incident captured by a bystander\n        The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) responded to the incident. The FDNY told Hyperallergic they received a call for a \"sprinkler emergency\" at 2:30 pm on Friday. The incident was resolved by 3 pm, FDNY said, and there were no injuries.Videos captured by bystanders show water raining steadily from the ceiling, including one containing light fixtures. \"I hope nothing is damaging the artwork,\" one person is heard saying.

The project, begun by artist Ellen Harvey in 2019, currently illustrates over 300 locales from some 40 countries, ranging from the Great Synagogue of Warsaw, the world’s largest Jewish house of worship when it was blown up by the Nazis in 1943, to Bavinger House of Norman, Oklahoma, an award-winning example of organic architecture by Bruce Goff, demolished in 2016. Also on view: the Colossus of Rhodes, felled by an earthquake in 226 BCE, and Tower Records, its retail stores liquidated in 2006, victims of a changing media landscape. Loss is the common ground on which they all stand. Indeed, it is the central conceit of Harvey’s venture, whose subjects are suggested by the public in answer to the following prompt: “Is there some place that you would like to visit or revisit that no longer exists?” The result, on view at the Chicago Architecture Center in a standalone exhibition, fills three walls in an immense and overwhelmingly mournful grid. Each diner, mosque, castle, or library is realistically painted on an 18-by-24-inch panel in black and white acrylic, then finished with oil glazes and labelled, in a smartly chosen range of fonts, with its name, location, and the date on which it ceased existence. Backstories can be read on the project website. The visual effect evokes old, hand-tinted postcards, helpfully causing anywhere to look beautiful and feel longed for, no matter its actual attractiveness. I miss Blockbuster Video greatly, as I miss so much about physical media, but it was never a pretty place. Here it rests, having filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and again in 2014, when the last of its stores closed.Installation view of Ellen Harvey's The Disappointed Tourist at the Chicago Architecture Center (photo Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Ellen Harvey, \"Columbian Exhibition–The White City\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardEnhancement is something of a speciality of Harvey’s. The artist, who was born in 1967 in Kent, England, and moved to the United States with her family as a teen, first came to prominence for her New York Beautification Project. From 1999 to 2001, she surreptitiously painted 40 small oval landscapes — gorgeous little things, skillfully done in oil and looking like Romantic-era tags — onto dumpsters, building facades, structural pylons, doors, basically anywhere in the city she wanted, so long as it had already been graffitied. As an experiment in using traditional art making for contemporary ends, it was both brave and clever. The Disappointed Tourist ups the ante a hundredfold, because now the places have meaning.Most of what was personally familiar to me from The Disappointed Tourist I knew from my years living in New York in the early aughts, and Harvey’s picturesque vistas stirred up feelings of nostalgia for an especially exciting time in my own life. They also left me sad and frustrated with the unrelenting and uncaring pace of urban development. Florent, the legendary late-night restaurant in the Meatpacking district — closed in 2008 due to rent increases. 5Pointz, that mecca of graffiti art in Long Island City — whitewashed by the landlord in 2013, and soon after torn down and replaced with condominiums. 2 Columbus Circle, the weirdest white whale of a building — reconfigured in 2008 in the most banal way possible by the Museum of Arts and Design, which should have known better. Tower Records, the World Trade Center, a Key Food in Park Slope — all gone. Chicago, where I have lived ever since, and to which Harvey dedicates 14 paintings, hardly fares any better. RIP Berlin nightclub and the original Prentice Women’s Hospital, designed by Bertrand Goldberg in all its curvy concrete glory.Ellen Harvey, \"Berlin nightclub\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardMost of those transformations can be attributed to the relatively banal causes of gentrification and corporatization. The destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, belongs to a different category entirely, one that accounts for many of the losses on view, from ancient times up to present day. Even without recognizing by name the Great Walls of Benin, Christchurch Greyfriars in London, Sarajevo City Hall, the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, or the Al Nuri Mosque of Mosul, I could confidently guess at which violent conflicts led to their destruction. Sure to be growing in number will be those due to climate change, a list that for now includes the Chacaltaya Glacier in Bolivia, melted away in 2009, and icebergs more generally. Stranger are the casualties of ancient times about which we know little, but can still feel much, like the rainforests that once covered Ireland or the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.Beyond traumatic disasters, The Disappointed Tourist offers an unofficial survey of what people value most. Panels dedicated to the Salem Oak, the Kletterbaum, the Arbol de la Noche Triste prove that places of significance need not be human-made — though mostly they are, and often they’re quite fun. Leisure complexes of all sorts and all eras figure strongly, from the engineering marvels built for international expositions to stadiums ancient and modern. Amazing bathing facilities of yesteryear abound, including the Moskva Pool, the largest in the world, outdoor, circular, and heated year round in central Moscow, until it was torn down in 1994 and replaced with a cathedral; and the Cliftonville Lido in Margate, England, a complex whose giant seaside pool was filled daily by the tide until its closure in 1978. The Savoy Ballroom, the legendary nightclub of Harlem, is here, as is the Toorak Drive-In, a modest theater in Melbourne. Wildly popular in their heyday all, closed or replaced as entertainment evolved.And on and on it goes. In a world of endless change and destruction, of bad luck and time passing, The Disappointed Tourist will always have new places to visit, and Ellen Harvey more canvases to fill. Ellen Harvey, \"Prentice Women's Hospital\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardEllen Harvey, \"Zum Deutschen Eck\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardThe Disappointed Tourist continues at the Chicago Architecture Center (111 East Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois) through April 19. The exhibition was curated by CAC Senior Director of Exhibitions Eve Fineman.\n                  \n                      \n                        Art Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Chicago\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

This doesn’t mean that painting is dead, just that his are. A lot of the discourse around his sculptures gets unnecessarily heated, with (often White) critics arguing over whether or not they critique capitalism or celebrate consumerism, which seems beside the point when fabricating one of his “Balloon Dogs” costs more money than the majority of Americans make in a year. Then there are the hilarious narratives circling his work, such as Arthur Jafa's deadpan, tongue-in-cheek assertion in a 2020 New Yorker article that Koons is “a very light-skinned Black guy passing for white,” and that the floating basketballs in his Equilibrium series are “testicles, connoting everything from castration to Black sexual prowess.” With Koons’s sculptures, it is hard not to think that his art exists in one world and the writing about it in another. It was with this split in mind that I visited his latest exhibition, Jeff Koons: Porcelain Series at Gagosian Gallery. I knew from the gallery press release that one of my experiences would be seeing myself both reflected and distorted in the mirror-polished stainless steel surface with a transparent color coating. The sculptures depict curvaceous figures, such as “Aphrodite” (2016–21), “Three Graces” (2016–22), and “Kissing Lovers” (2016–25). The press release notes: “The objects’ surfaces fuse their sensorial allure with symbolic potential. The finish affirms the viewer, making them a participant in the artwork and highlighting the works’ stylistic and conceptual interplay of past, present, and future.” Installation view of Jeff Koons: Porcelain Series at Gagosian (© Jeff Koons, photo Maris Hutchinson, courtesy Gagosian)There is something mildly interesting about seeing a distorted, miniaturized version of yourself reflected in a shiny surface that you realize is a shapely arm or a furless fox. It is like looking into a funhouse mirror at a carnival or standing in front of Anish Kapoor’s bean-shaped “Cloud Gate” in Chicago’s Millennium Park and taking a selfie. Once is enough, though. A stainless steel hubcap will distort you if that is your thing, but seeing yourself this way is apt to make you forget what you are looking at, as everything falls away, so its uncanny effects are fleeting.We also learn that his grandparents had porcelain figures. In an interview with Joachim Pissaro that appeared in The Brooklyn Rail, he tells Pissaro that the inspiration for many of his sculptures are original 18th-century Meissen porcelains, which are rare collectibles for the über wealthy. I was not surprised to hear him say: When I was a kid, I would play with them and I would be so excited. It was titillation, really. And the excitement that comes from this, that excitement is equal to any experience anybody else could have, even looking at a Michelangelo. You can’t really define how one is of more value, because as a young child you don’t know those hierarchies, but you do feel excitement, stimulation.\"We also learn that [Koons's] grandparents had porcelain figures.\" (photo Hakim Bishara/Hyperallergic)Koons’s belief that his childlike excitement is equal to anybody else’s, even when looking at a Michelangelo, because hierarchies aren’t yet learned, speaks to his utter lack of self-reflection. This is another cliché example of universalist thinking, in presuming insight into the emotions and hierarchies of others. This still persists, especially if you are a White American. One of the many points about which Koons opines when analyzing his balloons is how these works are a model of the individual:I’ve always liked the dialogue of internal being, and its exchange with the external world. And if we think about the skin as a kind of membrane, or interface — that’s something my balloon works emphasize, that interface between the interior and the exterior. Jeff Koons, \"Nymph, Pluto, and Satyr\" (2018–25), oil on canvas with aluminum leaf (© Jeff Koons, photo Maris Hutchinson, courtesy Gagosian)Since the works he’s referring to have a sensitive, reflective, metallic skin and a hollow body (it is literally empty inside), it seems to me that this shiny, distorting surface, which we also find in the recent porcelain works, is not mirroring the selfie-takers as much as those who identify with Koons’s aesthetics, and believe his work is an important contribution to art history and culture. When I try to picture where Koons’s sculptures belong and to and about whom they are speaking, I think about President Trump’s plan for a gaudy 90,000-square-foot ballroom for 1,000 guests, which was funded by private donations. The donors, many of whom are major art collectors, contributed millions to Trump’s compulsion to spend other people’s money for his causes. Some of the collectors include Warren Stephens, Ken Griffin, Paul Singer, Larry Fink, Charles and Helen Schwab, and John H. Tyson, who is also chairman of the board at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. They and other billionaires will be invited to the ballroom once it is completed; Koons’s sculptures would look right at home in it. Perhaps one of these philanthropists will buy one of the three editions of “Aphrodites” for the lobby of a yet-to-be-built five-star hotel in another \"everybody wins” gentrification scheme.  Installation view of \"Stag and Dog\" (2016–24) in Jeff Koons: Porcelain Series at Gagosian (© Jeff Koons, photo Maris Hutchinson, courtesy Gagosian)Jeff Koons: Porcelain Series continues at Gagosian (541 West 24th Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) through February 28.

    "body": "\n            The city of Philadelphia is suing the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the National Park Service (NPS) after officials removed wall text and illustrations describing slavery from a historical park on Thursday, January 22. The removal of exhibits about slavery from Independence National Historical Park comes months after Trump named the site in an executive order calling for reviews of exhibits at the Smithsonian and the National Parks system. Footage captured by the Philadelphia Inquirer shows staff dismantling labels from an exhibition about slavery within the park, which houses the Liberty Bell and the residence of the first United States presidents. The Constitution and Declaration of Independence were also signed on the site’s grounds.In his March 2025 executive order, Trump ordered the DOI, which oversees the NPS, to “take action” to ensure displays at its sites do not “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”A close-up shot of a removed panel describing the history of slaveryAccording to Philadelphia’s lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court, the removed items were part of the $8.5 million outdoor exhibition Freedom and Slavery in Making a New Nation, created in 2009 on the park’s President's House. The exhibition commemorated the lives of nine enslaved individuals whom George Washington brought to his residence. One panel, titled “The Dirty Business of Slavery,” described the Constitution’s failure to outlaw slavery, including its designation of enslaved individuals as three-fifths of a person. It also contained a graphic depicting the routes of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The panel further stated that after the US outlawed the importation of enslaved people, the enslaved population still grew, in part due to forced breeding resulting from the rape of enslaved women by White men.

The spokesperson condemned the City of Philadelphia for “filing frivolous lawsuits in the hopes of demeaning our brave Founding Fathers who set the brilliant road map for the greatest country in the world.” A close-up shot of a removed panel describing the history of slaveryExpecting drastic modifications to the country’s National Park signage, the Minnesota-born project Save Our Signs has already documented the contents of Independence National Historical Park exhibit and others across the country in a public database containing thousands of images. “We at Save Our Signs are angered and disappointed to learn about the removal of the President's House exhibit,” librarian Molly Blake, a founding member of Save Our Signs, told Hyperallergic. “[...] The administration's removal of this exhibit is an act of top-down censorship of history that makes those who agree with this administration's ideology uncomfortable.” Photos from the exhibition collected by Save Our Signs, before its alteration, show detailed text of the removed signage, as well as other exhibits, including a video work accompanied by a text describing how George Washington kept a rotation of enslaved individuals in and out of the state so that they would not become free under Pennsylvania law. In court, Philadelphia argued that the NPS did not have the authority to remove the exhibits, which the city had commissioned in partnership with the federal government. \"The whole site was the result of many years of community organizing and dialogue between local activists, historians, civic leaders, artists, political leaders, and government workers from the city, state, and federal government,\" Massiah told Hyperallergic.An exhibition item documented by Save Our SignsBlake noted that “while we have some photographs of this exhibit, these photographs can never replace the interpretive panels that have been removed.”“The photos help us remember what has been lost, but they are not a replacement for the exhibit, which belongs at the President's House,” Blake said.The extent to which the NPS dismantled the exhibition is unclear. The lawsuit requests the court to stop further removal of “any exhibits, panels, artwork, or other items from the President’s House Site” and asks the DOI “to ensure the safety, security, and preservation of any such items removed from the President’s House Site.” \"In remembering the nine enslaved Africans brought to that house from Virginia by the Washingtons, [the exhibition] allows all of us to understand the presence and crucial role played by Black Americans in the early years of this country,\" Massiah told Hyperallergic. “And also the decisions made about citizenship that have continued to be a major vector in shaping the American experiment.”\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                      \n                        Philadelphia\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nI’ve just start­ed read­ing J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hob­bit to my daugh­ter. While much of the nuance and the ref­er­ences to Tolkien­ian deep time are lost on her, she eas­i­ly grasps the dis­tinc­tive charms of the char­ac­ters, the nature of their jour­ney, and the per­ils, won­ders, and Elven friends they have met along the way so far. She is famil­iar with fairy tale dwarfs and myth­ic wiz­ards, though not with the typol­o­gy of insu­lar, mid­dle-class, adven­ture-averse coun­try gen­try, thus Hob­bits them­selves took a bit of explain­ing.\nWhile read­ing and dis­cussing the book with her, I’ve won­dered to myself about a pos­si­ble his­tor­i­cal rela­tion­ship between Tolkien’s fairy tale fig­ures and those of the Walt Dis­ney com­pa­ny which appeared around the same time. The troupe of dwarves in The Hob­bit might pos­si­bly share a com­mon ances­tor with Snow White’s dwarfs—in the Ger­man fairy tale the Broth­ers Grimm first pub­lished in 1812. But here is where any sim­i­lar­i­ty between Tolkien and Dis­ney begins and ends.\nIn fact, Tolkien most­ly hat­ed Disney’s cre­ations, and he made these feel­ings very clear. Snow White debuted only months after The Hob­bit’s pub­li­ca­tion in 1937. As it hap­pened, Tolkien went to see the film with lit­er­ary friend and some­time rival C.S. Lewis. Nei­ther liked it very much. In a 1939 let­ter, Lewis grant­ed that “the ter­ri­fy­ing bits were good, and the ani­mals real­ly most mov­ing.” But he also called Dis­ney a “poor boob” and lament­ed “What might not have come of it if this man had been educated—or even brought up in a decent soci­ety?”\nTolkien, notes Atlas Obscu­ra, “found Snow White love­ly, but oth­er­wise wasn’t pleased with the dwarves. To both Tolkien and Lewis, it seemed, Disney’s dwarves were a gross over­sim­pli­fi­ca­tion of a con­cept they held as precious”—the con­cept, that is, of fairy sto­ries. Some might brush away their opin­ions as two Oxford dons gaz­ing down their noses at Amer­i­can mass enter­tain­ment. As Tolkien schol­ar Trish Lam­bert puts it, “I think it grat­ed on them that he [Dis­ney] was com­mer­cial­iz­ing some­thing that they con­sid­ered almost sacro­sanct.”\n“Indeed,” writes Steven D. Grey­danus at the Nation­al Catholic Reg­is­ter, “it would be impos­si­ble to imag­ine” these two authors “being any­thing but appalled by Disney’s sil­ly dwarfs, with their slap­stick humor, nurs­ery-moniker names, and singsong musi­cal num­bers.” One might counter that Tolkien’s dwarves (as he insists on plu­ral­iz­ing the word), also have fun­ny names (derived, how­ev­er, from Old Norse) and also break into song. But he takes pains to sep­a­rate his dwarves from the com­mon run of children’s sto­ry dwarfs.\nTolkien would lat­er express his rev­er­ence for fairy tales in a schol­ar­ly 1947 essay titled “On Fairy Sto­ries,” in which he attempts to define the genre, pars­ing its dif­fer­ences from oth­er types of mar­velous fic­tion, and writ­ing with awe, “the realm of fairy sto­ry is wide and deep and high.” These are sto­ries to be tak­en seri­ous­ly, not dumb­ed-down and infan­tilized as he believed they had been. “The asso­ci­a­tion of chil­dren and fairy-sto­ries,” he writes, “is an acci­dent of our domes­tic his­to­ry.”\nTolkien wrote The Hob­bit for young peo­ple, but he did not write it as a “children’s book.” Noth­ing in the book pan­ders, not the lan­guage, nor the com­plex char­ac­ter­i­za­tion, nor the grown-up themes. Disney’s works, on the oth­er hand, rep­re­sent­ed to Tolkien a cheap­en­ing of ancient cul­tur­al arti­facts, and he seemed to think that Disney’s approach to films for chil­dren was espe­cial­ly con­de­scend­ing and cyn­i­cal.\nHe described Disney’s work on the whole as “vul­gar” and the man him­self, in a 1964 let­ter, as “sim­ply a cheat,” who is “hope­less­ly cor­rupt­ed” by prof­it-seek­ing (though he admits he is “not inno­cent of the prof­it-motive” him­self).\n…I rec­og­nize his tal­ent, but it has always seemed to me hope­less­ly cor­rupt­ed. Though in most of the ‘pic­tures’ pro­ceed­ing from his stu­dios there are admirable or charm­ing pas­sages, the effect of all of them is to me dis­gust­ing. Some have giv­en me nau­sea… \nThis expli­ca­tion of Tolkien’s dis­like for Dis­ney goes beyond mere gos­sip to an impor­tant prac­ti­cal upshot: Tolkien would not allow any of his works to be giv­en the Walt Dis­ney treat­ment. While his pub­lish­er approached the stu­dios about a Lord of the Rings adap­ta­tion (they were turned down at the time), most schol­ars think this hap­pened with­out the author’s knowl­edge, which seems a safe assump­tion to say the least.\nTolkien’s long his­to­ry of express­ing neg­a­tive opin­ions about Dis­ney led to his lat­er for­bid­ding, “as long as it was pos­si­ble,” any of his works to be pro­duced “by the Dis­ney stu­dios (for all whose works I have a heart­felt loathing).” Astute read­ers of Tolkien know his seri­ous intent in even the most com­ic of his char­ac­ters and sit­u­a­tions. Or as Vin­tage News’ Mar­tin Cha­lakos­ki writes, “there is not a speck of Dis­ney in any of those pages.”\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2018.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nJ.R.R.

    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tNovember 19th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf pressed to pick the most inter­na­tion­al art fig­ure of the past dozen years, one could do much worse than the Swedish artist-mys­tic Hilma af Klint, despite her hav­ing been dead for more than 80 years now. As evi­denced by the links at the bot­tom of the post, we’ve been fea­tur­ing her here on Open Cul­ture since 2017, first in the con­text of whether she counts as the first abstract painter. Just a few years before that, prac­ti­cal­ly no one in the world had ever heard her name, let alone beheld any of her more than 1,200 paint­ings and draw­ings. In fact, it was only in 2013, with the show Hilma af Klint — A Pio­neer of Abstrac­tion at Stock­holm’s Mod­er­na Museet, that she first became pub­licly known.\nFrom there, her can­on­iza­tion pro­ceed­ed rapid­ly. One uses that word advis­ed­ly, giv­en af Klin­t’s reli­gios­i­ty, whose inten­si­ty, eso­teri­cism, and rig­or con­sti­tute one of the themes of Alice Gre­go­ry’s recent New York­er piece on the artist’s work, lega­cy, and rel­a­tive­ly new­found pop­u­lar­i­ty, all of it col­ored by the fact that none of her pieces have ever been for sale.\nThe uncan­ni­ly mod­ern, before-its-time aes­thet­ic appeal of af Klin­t’s work is one thing; the dearth of wide­spread knowl­edge about the details of her life and thought, which has allowed many of her sud­den­ly avid twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry fans to imag­ine her into their pre­ferred artis­tic, philo­soph­i­cal, and social nar­ra­tives, is anoth­er. Yet key to the fas­ci­na­tion of her images is that, hav­ing been born in 1862, she was­n’t a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry woman.\n\n\n\t\n\nAf Klint bare­ly even belonged to the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, or indeed to any world­ly time peri­od at all. The com­plex and seem­ing­ly con­tra­dic­to­ry world­view that inspired her art­work is prac­ti­cal­ly inac­ces­si­ble to us, even if we man­age to get through the 26,000 jour­nal pages she left behind. Gre­go­ry inter­views one such (and per­haps the only) ded­i­cat­ed indi­vid­ual, a non­prof­it CEO and af Klint schol­ar ded­i­cat­ed to explod­ing the myths that have so read­i­ly accret­ed around her. One is that she worked alone: evi­dence sug­gests that some paint­ings attrib­uted to her may actu­al­ly have been exe­cut­ed by oth­er mem­bers of her spir­i­tu­al­ist cir­cle, The Five. But even if she turns out not to have been a move­ment of one after all, her name will no doubt con­tin­ue to sell out muse­um exhi­bi­tions for years to come.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nDis­cov­er Hilma af Klint: Pio­neer­ing Mys­ti­cal Painter and Per­haps the First Abstract Artist\nThe Life & Art of Hilma Af Klint: A Short Art His­to­ry Les­son on the Pio­neer­ing Abstract Artist\nNew Hilma af Klint Doc­u­men­tary Explores the Life & Art of the Trail­blaz­ing Abstract Artist\nA Short Video Intro­duc­tion to Hilma af Klint, the Mys­ti­cal Female Painter Who Helped Invent Abstract Art\nThe Com­plete Works of Hilma af Klint Get Pub­lished for the First Time in a Beau­ti­ful, Sev­en-Vol­ume Col­lec­tion\nWho Paint­ed the First Abstract Paint­ing?: Wass­i­ly Kandin­sky?

    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tNovember 19th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen wood­cut artist Kat­sushi­ka Hoku­sai made his famous print The Great Wave off Kana­gawa in 1830 — part of the series Thir­ty-six Views of Mount Fuji — he was 70 years old and had lived his entire life in a Japan closed off from the rest of the world. In the 19th cen­tu­ry, how­ev­er, “the rest of the world was becom­ing indus­tri­al­ized,” James Payne explains above in his Great Art Explained video, “and the Japan­ese were con­cerned about for­eign inva­sions.” The Great Wave shows “an image of Japan fear­ful that the sea — which has pro­tect­ed its peace­ful iso­la­tion for so long — would become its down­fall.”\nIt’s also true, how­ev­er, that The Great Wave would not have exist­ed with­out a for­eign inva­sion. Pruss­ian blue, the first sta­ble blue pig­ment, acci­den­tal­ly invent­ed around 1705 in Berlin, arrived in the ports of Nagasa­ki on Dutch and Chi­nese ships in the 1820s. Pruss­ian Blue would start a new artis­tic move­ment in Japan, aizuri‑e, wood­cuts print­ed in bright, vivid blues.\n“Hoku­sai was one of the first Japan­ese print­mak­ers to bold­ly embrace the colour,” Hugh Davies writes at The Con­ver­sa­tion, “a deci­sion that would have major impli­ca­tions in the world of art.” When the country’s iso­la­tion­ist poli­cies end­ed in the 1850s, “a show­case at the inau­gur­al Japan­ese Pavil­ion ele­vat­ed the artis­tic sta­tus of wood­block prints and a craze for their col­lec­tion quick­ly fol­lowed.”\n\nChief among the works col­lect­ed in the Euro­pean and Amer­i­can fer­vor for Japan­ese prints were those from Hoku­sai, his con­tem­po­rary Hiroshige, and oth­er aizuri‑e artists. So famous was The Great Wave in the West by 1891 that French graph­ic artist Pierre Bon­nard would sat­i­rize its styl­ish spray in an adver­tise­ment for cham­pagne. A print of The Great Wave hung on Claude Debussy’s wall, and the first edi­tion of his La Mer bore an adap­ta­tion of a detail from the print. As Michael Cirigliano writes for the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Muse­um of Art:\nCul­tur­al cir­cles through­out Europe great­ly admired Hoku­sai’s work…. Major artists of the Impres­sion­ist move­ment such as Mon­et owned copies of Hoku­sai prints, and lead­ing art crit­ic Philippe Bur­ty, in his 1866 Chefs-d’oeu­vre des Arts indus­triels, even stat­ed that Hoku­sai’s work main­tained the ele­gance of Wat­teau, the fan­ta­sy of Goya, and the move­ment of Delacroix. Going one step fur­ther in his laud­ed com­par­isons, Bur­ty wrote that Hoku­sai’s dex­ter­i­ty in brush strokes was com­pa­ra­ble only to that of Rubens.\nThese com­par­isons are not mis­placed, John-Paul Stonard explains in The Guardian: “That the Great Wave became the best known print in the west was in large part due to Hokusai’s for­ma­tive expe­ri­ence of Euro­pean art.” Not only did he absorb Pruss­ian blue into his reper­toire, but “prints from ear­ly in his career show him attempt­ing, rather awk­ward­ly, to apply the les­son of math­e­mat­i­cal per­spec­tive, learnt from Euro­pean prints brought into Japan by Dutch Traders.” By the time of The Great Wave, he had per­fect­ed his own syn­the­sis of West­ern and Japan­ese art, over two decades before Euro­pean painters would attempt the same in the explo­sion of Japanophil­ia of the late 19th and ear­ly 20th cen­turies.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2021.\nRelat­ed Con­tent: \nView 103 Dis­cov­ered Draw­ings by Famed Japan­ese Wood­cut Artist Kat­sushi­ka Hoku­sai\nGet Free Draw­ing Lessons from Kat­sushi­ka Hoku­sai, Who Famous­ly Paint­ed The Great Wave of Kana­gawa: Read His How-To Book, Quick Lessons in Sim­pli­fied Draw­ings\nHokusai’s Action-Packed Illus­tra­tions of Japan­ese & Chi­nese War­riors (1836)\nA Col­lec­tion of Hokusai’s Draw­ings Are Being Carved Onto Wood­blocks & Print­ed for the First Time Ever\nThe Evo­lu­tion of Hokusai’s Great Wave: A Study of 113 Known Copies of the Icon­ic Wood­block Print\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom thousands of colorful hair beads, Felandus Thames conjures vibrant patterns and portraits. He takes historical photographs as a starting point, focusing especially on Black and Indigenous figures whose stories have largely been underrepresented in American historical narrative. These include dancer and choreographer Alvin Ailey and Amos Haskins, a 19th-century Wampanoag man who became a master mariner—one of the few Indigenous people to do so.\nBased in Woodbridge, Connecticut, with his studio in West Haven, Thames emphasizes powerful associations with materials. In the case of these portraits, he employs beads frequently used to style braids. Recent projects also include installations incorporating multiple hairbrushes. “Lately, I’ve been thinking about the affordances of material and their ability to necessitate an idea,” Thames tells Colossal. “I’ve been mining materials from my childhood,” he adds, delving into memories that connect him and others within the Black diaspora.\n“Let’s dance (portrait of Alvin Ailey)” (2025) hair beads on coated wire and aluminum rod, 60 x 41 x 4 inches. Image courtesy of the artist and Antony Terrana Collection\nThese materials reference both historical and contemporary functions, from the use of beads and shells as currency in early societies to the way a beaded curtain was separated different areas within Thames’ childhood home. “In these works, I offer the everyday as cultural currency,” he says.\nThames describes the mass-produced plastic components as “Black pixels,” akin to pieces of fabric patchworked together to form a quilt. A creative practice his maternal ancestors also pursued, quilting provides another “way of speaking to how carry memory with us,” he says. The neatly beaded strands, suspended from aluminum rods, also become almost fabric-like.\nIn his recent work, Thames has been interested in the Black radical tradition, a philosophy that rejects colonial attitudes, such as slavery, racial segregation, and other forms of oppression. The Black Panthers and the civil rights movement evolved around this philosophy, with more recent examples including the Black Lives Matter movement.\nFor Thames, Black radical tradition is “a form of resistance and insurgency” by people who took great leaps and made lasting change. “My focus gets beyond the outlier or exceptional individual, but thinking about people who have fostered sustainable change to the apparatus,” he says.\n“African King of Dubious Origins” (2022), hair beads on coated wire and aluminum rod, 48 x 78 1/4 x 4 inches. Image courtesy of the artist\nThames’ portraits exemplify changes or behavior that created something akin to what he calls a “scaffolding for substantive change.” Surrounded by vibrant patterns, their likenesses, often drawn from black-and-white archival photos, become timeless.\n“Wail on Whalers (portrait of Amos Haskin)” is currently part of Entwined: Freedom, Sovereignty, and the Sea, which continues through January 19 at the Mystic Seaport Museum. Thames’ work is also currently on view in the group exhibition EXODUS at the Wellin Museum of Art at Hamilton College, which continues through April 18, 2026.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nEaster egg-like clouds, glowing sunrise gradients, and myriad vibrant patterns are just a few of the elements comprising David Brian Smith’s otherworldly landscapes.\nSmith grew up in rural Shropshire, England, and his ancestral ties to the region’s agricultural traditions became a major influence on his work after he relocated to London. His works evoke British landscape painting of the likes of the Norwich School of painters, a group of self-taught, working-class artists who self-organized an art society in the early 19th century.\n“All around the Wrekin” (2025), oil on linen, 78 3/4 x 70 7/8 inches\nSmith departs from historically more academic styles of oil painting to create works “re-envisioned through a hallucinatory, technicolor lens,” says Ross + Kramer Gallery, which presents the artist’s solo exhibition, All around the Wrekin. In his starkly contrasted rolling hills, farm buildings, and bulbous trees, Smith also evokes the bucolic yet faintly uncanny paintings of American Regionalist artist Grant Wood (1891-1942).\n“Rooted in the English pastoral tradition yet boldly contemporary in vision, Smith’s paintings explore ideas of place, belonging, and time through radiant color, intricate brushwork, and layered symbolism,” the gallery says. The title of the show references the name of a hill in Shropshire called the Wrekin, distinctive for its conical shape and a popular place to take walks.\nWithin the sky, fields, rivers, and forests, hundreds of little hatch marks, flowers, starbursts, and other thematic motifs dance across the surface. He also often incorporates gold and silver leaf to add an even further ethereality to the large-scale, luminous canvases, tapping into the power of color and light to evoke nostalgia and a kind of psychedelic utopianism.\nAll around the Wrekin continues through November 22 in San Francisco. Smith’s work is also on view as part of Inner and Outer Worlds, an exhibition of international contemporary painting that runs through April 12 at the Ju Ming Museum in Taiwan.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne glimpse of Jeremy Brooks’ crocheted vessels, and you’d be forgiven for thinking they’re knotted with vinyl cord. These playful, colorful, and meticulously crafted pieces are actually made of porcelain. His works are also deceptively small—usually around three inches wide—making the process of literally stitching slender lengths of clay even more impressive.\nCurrently based in Conway, South Carolina, where he is Assistant Professor of Ceramics at Coastal Carolina University, Brooks has spent the last several years experimenting with the consistency of clay. While we may think of the hardened medium as brittle and rigid, the artist challenges the limits if its flexibility.\n“Knot Pot 2530” (2025), crocheted colored porcelain, 2.75 x 3 x 3.25 inches\n“A portion of my research has fixated around a unique blend of clay materials that possess qualities of elasticity rather than qualities of plasticity traditionally found in common clay recipes,” he says in a statement. “To put it plainly, it behaves more like rubber than clay, and sets up very quickly once the components are measured and mixed.”\nBrooks begins by extruding long coils in different colors, also sometimes rolling the medium into paper-thin slabs. Unlike greenware—clay that’s hardened but has not yet been fired—the material is very pliable and stretchy. “A coil made of this clay can easily be tied into a tight knot,” he says. “This method may be used to join different pieces together, or the clay can be crocheted, knitted, or woven into more dynamic forms.”\nMany of Brooks’ vessels are exuberant expressions of color, while others are more earthy and wood-fired. As if made of soft material, the vessels appear to squish and bend, further emphasizing the vibrant reference to fiber.\nBrooks’ work is on view alongside Steven Young Lee and Michael Velliquette until December 31 at Duane Reed Gallery in St. Louis.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom dozens of painted mesh fabric panels, Tomislav Topić’s undulating, site-specific installations transform airy spaces into immersive experiences. Superimposed in layers that are meticulously suspended from the ceiling or between outdoor structures, the panels interact with sunlight and one another to create vibrant gradients.\nOne of Topić’s most recent interventions, Echoverse, consists of 57 different colors on 451 panels, stretching nearly 100 feet long and about 25 feet wide. It’s currently installed in a spacious former chapel home to Les 3 CHA, an art center in Châteaugiron, France, where the work flutters wave-like through the open space.\nDetail of “Echoverse”\nAdditional recent pieces include “Nexus Lucis,” which centered above the altar of a large church in Gisors, France, earlier this year. And new this fall, an outdoor installation titled “Afterburn” floats above Intendencia Street in downtown Pensacola, Florida.\nGeometry, hue, and light interact to create prismatic interactions. “Every color, every layer, every viewpoint responds to another—like lines of a poem extending one another, or like sound waves traveling through the space and refracting in the air,” Topić says in a statement. Hovering independently yet arranged with precision, the perceived effect evolves as one walks around the work. From one vantage point, the installation may appear more opaque, but from another, its faceted and translucent nature is revealed.\nTopić carefully considers the nature of spaces, how we interact within them, and how shifting light throughout the day changes how they feel. “It is important to me to create a work that introduces a deliberate contrast, yet still merges with the space,” he says. “I love this symbiosis; for me, it is essential—especially in a place that carries more than 800 years of history.”\nEchoverse continues through December 14.

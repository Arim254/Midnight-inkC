    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nPho­to via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nThe his­to­ry of sci­ence, like most every his­to­ry we learn, comes to us as a pro­ces­sion of great, almost exclu­sive­ly white, men, unbro­ken but for the occa­sion­al token woman—well-deserving of her hon­ors but seem­ing­ly anom­alous nonethe­less. “If you believe the his­to­ry books,” notes the Time­line series The Matil­da Effect, “sci­ence is a guy thing. Dis­cov­er­ies are made by men, which spur fur­ther inno­va­tion by men, fol­lowed by acclaim and prizes for men. But too often, there is an unsung woman genius who deserves just as much cred­it” and who has been over­shad­owed by male col­leagues who grabbed the glo­ry.\nIn 1993, Cor­nell Uni­ver­si­ty his­to­ri­an of sci­ence Mar­garet Rossiter dubbed the denial of recog­ni­tion to women sci­en­tists “the Matil­da effect,” for suf­frag­ist and abo­li­tion­ist Matil­da Joslyn Gage, whose 1893 essay “Woman as an Inven­tor” protest­ed the com­mon asser­tion that “woman… pos­sess­es no inven­tive or mechan­i­cal genius.” Such asser­tions, Gage pro­ceed­ed to demon­strate, “are care­less­ly or igno­rant­ly made… although woman’s sci­en­tif­ic edu­ca­tion has been gross­ly neglect­ed, yet some of the most impor­tant inven­tions of the world are due to her.”\nOver 100 years lat­er, Rossiter’s tena­cious work in unearthing the con­tri­bu­tions of U.S. women sci­en­tists inspired the His­to­ry of Sci­ence Soci­ety to name a pres­ti­gious prize after her. The Time­line series pro­files a few of the women whom it describes as prime exam­ples of the Matil­da effect, includ­ing Dr. Lise Meit­ner, the Aus­tri­an-born physi­cist and pio­neer of nuclear tech­nol­o­gy who escaped the Nazis and became known in her time as “the Jew­ish Moth­er of the Bomb,” though she had noth­ing to do with the atom­ic bomb. Instead, “Meit­ner led the research that ulti­mate­ly dis­cov­ered nuclear fis­sion.” But Meit­ner would become “lit­tle more than a foot­note in the his­to­ry of Nazi sci­en­tists and the birth of the Atom­ic age.”\nInstead, Meitner’s col­league Otto Hahn received the acco­lades, a Nobel Prize in Chem­istry and “renown as the dis­cov­er­er of nuclear fis­sion. Meit­ner, who direct­ed Hahn’s most sig­nif­i­cant exper­i­ments and cal­cu­lat­ed the ener­gy release result­ing from fis­sion, received a few essen­tial­ist head­lines fol­lowed by decades of obscu­ri­ty.” (See Meit­ner and Hahn in the pho­to above.) Like­wise, the name of Alice Augus­ta Ball has been “all but scrubbed from the his­to­ry of med­i­cine,” though it was Ball, an African Amer­i­can chemist from Seat­tle, Wash­ing­ton, who pio­neered what became known as the Dean Method, a rev­o­lu­tion­ary treat­ment for lep­rosy.\nBall con­duct­ed her research at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Hawaii, but she trag­i­cal­ly died at the age of 24, in what was like­ly a lab acci­dent, before the results could be pub­lished. Instead, Uni­ver­si­ty Pres­i­dent Dr. Arthur Dean, who had co-taught chem­istry class­es with Ball, con­tin­ued her work. But he failed “to men­tion Ball’s key con­tri­bu­tion” despite protes­ta­tions from Dr. Har­ry Holl­mann, a sur­geon who worked with Ball on treat­ing lep­rosy patients. Dean claimed cred­it and pub­lished their work under his name. Decades lat­er, “the scant archival trail of Alice Ball was redis­cov­ered…. In 2000, a plaque was installed at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Hawaii com­mem­o­rat­ing Ball’s accom­plish­ments.”\nOth­er women in the Matil­da effect series include bac­te­r­i­al geneti­cist Esther Leder­berg, who made amaz­ing dis­cov­er­ies in genet­ics that won her hus­band a Nobel Prize; Irish astro­physi­cist Joce­lyn Bell Bur­nell, who dis­cov­ered the first radio pul­sars in 1967, but was exclud­ed from the Nobel award­ed to her the­sis super­vi­sor Antony Hewish and astronomer Mar­tin Ryle. A sim­i­lar fate befell Dr. Ros­alind Franklin, the chemist exclud­ed from the Nobel award­ed to her col­leagues James Wat­son, Fran­cis Crick, and Mau­rice Wilkins for the dis­cov­ery of DNA.\nThese promi­nent exam­ples are but the tip of the ice­berg when it comes to women who made sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tions to sci­en­tif­ic his­to­ry and were reward­ed by being writ­ten out of it and denied awards and recog­ni­tion in their life­time. For more on the his­to­ry of U.S. women in sci­ence and the social forces that worked to exclude them, see Mar­garet Rossiter’s three-vol­ume Women Sci­en­tists in Amer­i­ca series: Strug­gles and Strate­gies to 1940, Before Affir­ma­tive Action, 1940–1972, and Forg­ing a New World since 1972.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt felt, for quite some time there, like the age of Frank Gehry would nev­er end. But now that the lat­est defin­ing fig­ure of Amer­i­can archi­tec­ture — or tech­ni­cal­ly, Cana­di­an-Amer­i­can archi­tec­ture — has died at the age of 96, the time has come to ask when, exact­ly, his age began. Or rather, with which build­ing: Walt Dis­ney Con­cert Hall in Los Ange­les? The Louis Vuit­ton Foun­da­tion in Paris? The rad­i­cal ren­o­va­tion of his own hum­ble San­ta Mon­i­ca home often cit­ed at the ori­gin point of the metal­lic, delib­er­ate­ly incon­gru­ous, often near­ly alien aes­thet­ic now rec­og­nized around the world? Accord­ing to the B1M video above, it is to the Guggen­heim Muse­um Bil­bao we must look to if we wish to under­stand the archi­tec­ture of Frank Gehry — and much else besides.\nThe Guggen­heim Bil­bao was a chal­leng­ing project when it was first con­ceived in the ear­ly nine­teen-nineties, but then, Bil­bao was a chal­lenged set­ting. Once a pros­per­ous port city, the Basque metrop­o­lis had fall­en on hard times indeed, rapid­ly dein­dus­tri­al­iz­ing with­out much in the way of alter­na­tive appeal. Bil­bao’s slight his­to­ry with tourism went back to the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry, but for many Spaniards, the prospect of turn­ing the place into an inter­na­tion­al des­ti­na­tion seemed remote at best. Still, an ambi­tious devel­op­ment plan was devised involv­ing new infra­struc­ture, includ­ing the city’s first metro sys­tem, cen­tered around a branch of New York’s Solomon R. Guggen­heim Muse­um.\nWith its orig­i­nal Fifth Avenue loca­tion designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (Gehry’s pre­de­ces­sor in the cul­tur­al role of the one archi­tect, or “star­chi­tect,” of whom every­one has heard), that insti­tu­tion had a cer­tain degree of expe­ri­ence with dar­ing build­ing designs. Famil­iar though the look of its gleam­ing sculp­tur­al curves may be today, actu­al­ly con­struct­ing their non-Euclid­ean geo­met­ric forms in real­i­ty required tech­nolo­gies nev­er before wide­ly employed in archi­tec­ture, includ­ing the ear­ly 3D-mod­el­ing sys­tem CATIA (this video’s spon­sor, inci­den­tal­ly). Nor was the search for the right exte­ri­or tex­ture to reflect Bil­bao’s dis­tinc­tive­ly cloudy skies espe­cial­ly straight­for­ward, but it did ben­e­fit from good tim­ing: Gehry deter­mined that tita­ni­um could do the job, where­upon the mass decom­mis­sion­ing of Sovi­et sub­marines hap­pened to dump a great deal of that mate­r­i­al on the mar­ket.\nIn these tech­no­log­i­cal, polit­i­cal, and eco­nom­ic ways, the Guggen­heim Bil­bao was a prod­uct of its time. As it hap­pened, it and the asso­ci­at­ed rede­vel­op­ments did, in fact, breathe new life into the city, which has inspired a decades-long “Bil­bao effect” on projects around the world with sim­i­lar goals, some of them also fea­tur­ing Gehry-designed cul­tur­al insti­tu­tions. As the B1M host Fred Mills puts it, “Telling a sto­ry like this real­ly is like read­ing out a list of things that we, today, take for grant­ed: the idea that a muse­um could be an inter­na­tion­al tourist attrac­tion, the tech­nol­o­gy, the 3D design.” And, like most archi­tects, Gehry is sur­vived by not just his built lega­cy, but also a series of projects not yet com­plete — includ­ing the Guggen­heim Abu Dhabi, sched­uled to open its doors next year.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nGehry’s Vision for Archi­tec­ture\nAn Archi­tec­tur­al Tour of Sagra­da Família, Antoni Gaudí’s Auda­cious Church That’s Been Under Con­struc­tion for 142 Years\nOn the Impor­tance of the Cre­ative Brief: Frank Gehry, Maira Kalman & Oth­ers Explain its Essen­tial Role\nHow Zaha Hadid Rev­o­lu­tion­ized Archi­tec­ture & Drew Inspi­ra­tion from Russ­ian Avant-Garde Art\nTake an Online Course on Design & Archi­tec­ture with Frank Gehry\nFrank Lloyd Wright Thought About Mak­ing the Guggen­heim Muse­um Pink\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne of the top comments on a new video from the Victoria and Albert Museum reads as follows: “I think it is time to have a renaissance of mourning. In this age of sanitized and hidden grief, it would be a welcomed relief for a more refined mourning experience.”\nThis commenter is responding to two V&A curators unboxing a collection of 19th-century objects common in Victorian mourning traditions. Through a variety of garments, ephemera, and photos, the pair showcases the elaborate rituals and rites people once used to honor the dead.\n\n\n\nThe video highlights a black, silk gown with tiny pleats, delicate lace, and sequins, along with jewelry made from semi-precious jet stones, and brooches containing human hair. The curators also present several printed artifacts, like mourning cards and portraits of the dying.\nWhat becomes clear throughout the video is how much our contemporary culture of grief and loss has turned inward and is something managed privately rather than shared with a community. “Mourning objects can be personal, portable, ostentatious, sentimental, or even a little bit grizzly,” the curators add. “Is it too much? Or do you think we should mourn the passing of these poignant and fascinating trappings of grief?”\nFind the unboxing on YouTube, along with several additional adventures in the museum’s collections.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMIAMI BEACH — For the third year in a row, a coalition of Miami artists and activists met at City Hall near the Miami Beach Convention Center today, December 6, on the busy Saturday of Art Basel to raise their voices and handmade signs in protest of the event’s ties to the genocide in Gaza. This time, the advocacy group Artists 4 Artists also joined the action to call for a boycott of the next edition of the fair in 2026, citing the event's impact on both the environment and the local arts community. After being relocated from the front of the Convention Center last year by dozens of Miami Beach police officers, several of the organizers are involved in ongoing litigation with the city of Miami Beach over what they allege are violations of their free speech. Chanting from the grass in front of City Hall within view of the fair entrance, dozens of protestors spoke with passing fairgoers peacefully about Israel’s ongoing violence in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank despite a ceasefire.The action brought together members of Artists 4 Artists and Jewish Voice for Peace. (photo courtesy A4A:MIA)Watched by a police sniper on a nearby rooftop and three rented vans with screens on them that accused South Florida Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP) leaders of being antisemitic, organizers raised the “LET PALESTINE LIVE” banner that was sewn for Art Week in December 2023. They handed out leaflets that included QR codes linking to poetry and visual art by Mahmoud Darwish, Hazem Harb, and other Palestinian writers and artists. A spokesperson for Art Basel told Hyperallergic that the fair was “in close coordination with the City of Miami Beach and the Miami Beach Police Department to ensure that demonstrators were able to gather in the public area outside the venue, and that visitors could access the fair safely and without disruption.”Attendees flagged the presence of police and a sniper on a nearby rooftop. (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)Palestinian-American artist and activist Elias Rischmawi was approached several times by police officers who claimed handing out flyers on the sidewalk was not allowed. In an interview with Hyperallergic, Rischmawi pointed to the importance of de-centering this week and Art Basel in the close-knit Miami art scene. “It’s strange seeing our people on those trucks being vilified, because they are scared of us and we’re just coming from a place of love and commitment and trying to build bridges in our community,” Rischmawi said. “I think even just people seeing how we are happy and all together and in true community outside of a money-centered event like this is valuable.”Rischmawi is organizing an exhibition at the Boom Box in Miami next week called Beyond Home, which will use the form of a tent to consider displacement in both a Floridian and international context and feature Palestinian and immigrant artists. Dozens gathered near City Hall in Miami Beach. (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)In speeches, JVP leaders pointed to Art Basel sponsor UBS’s investment in Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems as the primary reason for this year’s demonstration. Miami-Dade County has also invested a reported $151 million in Israeli bonds. Meanwhile, Miami Artists 4 Artists organizers misael soto and johann c. muñoz-tapasco urged people to boycott Art Basel and its associated events next year.“These fairs come here and extract the labor of gig workers, extract the cultural nuances and energies that the city has to offer, and turn that into a profit that none of us see,” muñoz-tapasco explained, pointing to the intersectionality of Palestine with the larger rise of fascism and censorship in Florida under the Republican-led government. Police presence at the protest (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)“These institutions want our art, but they don’t want the people who make the art. They refuse to do things that will make the world safer for us, and are often complicit in the systems eroding our work,” muñoz-tabasco continued. “We’re not just in late stage capitalism, but in a kind of cognitive capitalism, where our artwork is feeding AI programs, from image to writing,\" they said. “We are in a position of advantage because we have the actual vision, which they want, but we are taught that we have to be a certain way to be anyone in the world of the arts.”The Art Basel spokesperson said the fair “remains deeply committed to the creative community in Greater Miami and to supporting the many Miami Beach– and Miami-based artists who participate in our show through their galleries.” UBS, the spokesperson added, is “Art Basel’s long-standing Global Lead Partner, and our collaboration is focused on supporting artists, galleries, and cultural programming across our shows worldwide.\"Artist Eddie Arroyo holds up his drawing of the police sniper. (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)Miami Artists 4 Artists was one of the organizers of an ongoing artists’ census, as well as an exhibition earlier this year called The Artist as Activist, which protested the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center in the Everglades. Recognizing that this week is an important source of income for South Florida artists and culture workers, they envision the boycott as a call in to locals and visitors, with exhibitions and programming that are artist- instead of industry-centric. As artist Eddie Arroyo sketched the police vans at the edge of the barricade, Jewish Miami resident Amanda Rose pointed to the religious resonance of looking towards the future. “There’s a saying many of us grew up hearing around Passover: ‘Next year in Jerusalem.’ And it was a subtle way of initiating us into Zionism. But there’s something very powerful about that thought, like projecting into the next year,” she shared in an interview with Hyperallergic. “Maybe next year we won’t have to be here. Maybe if we continue to say it, Palestine will be free.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tJack Whitten for “Jack Whitten: The Messenger” at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkMarch 23–August 2, 2025Curators: Michelle Kuo, with Helena Klevorn, Dana Liljegren, and David Sledge \n\n\tAcross his six-decade career, Jack Whitten repeatedly found daring, innovative, and new ways of wielding paint, only rarely using the traditional oil-on-canvas method that has long dominated his chosen medium. During the late 1960s, he began using acrylic, a type of paint that dries faster than oil and was generally eschewed by artists for that reason at the time. Shortly afterward, he started dragging his paint across his canvases rather than wielding a brush. And in his later years, he made mosaic-like paintings composed from dried acrylic chips and refuse.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tAll this experimentation should have easily qualified Whitten as one of the defining abstractionists of his era, but until very recently, the canon failed to accept him—even in New York, where Whitten was based for most of his career. Building on a traveling survey that visited the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis between 2015 and 2016, the Museum of Modern Art staged a 175-work mega-retrospective for Whitten this year that filled an entire floor. Curated by Michelle Kuo, it was the first show of its kind since Whitten’s death in 2018.\n\n\tThe vast exhibition, titled “Jack Whitten: The Messenger,” succeeded in large part because it conveyed the physicality of Whitten’s painterly technique and the materiality of his art. Many viewers responded to the inclusion of the Developer, the squeegee-like tool that Whitten created in 1970 to pull his paint around. Where many retrospectives are satisfied by merely letting the work speak for itself, this one also shined a light on the tools used to make it.\n\n\tKuo’s retrospective attested to the diversity of Whitten’s oeuvre. There were early works from the ’60s contending with his experiences demonstrating during the civil rights movement. There were mid-career works from the ’80s and ’90s paying homage to Black thinkers such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Ralph Ellison. And there were even lesser-known late-career works such as a monumentally scaled abstraction from 2006 that memorializes the experience of living in New York on 9/11. In refusing to pigeonhole Whitten by ascribing a single aesthetic to him, the exhibition allowed the artist to remain as complex as he was during the lifetime—and paves the way for greater recognition of his many achievements in the centuries to come.\n\n\n\tNominees:\n\n\tAlvin Ailey“Edges of Ailey”Whitney Museum, New YorkSeptember 25, 2024–February 9, 2025Curator: Adrienne Edwards\n\n\tRuth Asawa“Ruth Asawa: Retrospective”San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San FranciscoApril 5–September 2, 2025Curators: Janet Bishop and Cara Manes, with Marin Sarvé-Tarr, William Hernández Luege, and Dominika Tylcz\n\n\tNoah Davis“Noah Davis”Hammer Museum, Los AngelesJune 8–August 31, 2025Curators: Eleanor Nairne and Wells Fray-Smith; Aram Moshayedi, with Ikechúkwú Onyewuenyi and Nyah Ginwright\n\n\tMadalena Santos Reinbolt“Madalena Santos Reinbolt: A Head Full of Planets”American Folk Art Museum, New YorkFebruary 12–May 25, 2025Curators: Amanda Carneiro and André Mesquita; Valérie Rousseau, with Dylan Blau Edelstein\n",

    "body": "\n\t“Bowls, Boxes, Plates & Vessels” at Parker Gallery, Los AngelesFebruary 1–October 19, 2025\n\n\tSaying goodbye can be hard. That was the premise of “Bowls, Boxes, Plates & Vessels,” Parker Gallery’s final exhibition at its longtime base in founder Sam Parker’s home in LA’s Los Feliz neighborhood. Since its founding in 2017, Parker Gallery has gained a reputation for spotlighting under-recognized artists alongside rising ones. This show thrillingly continued that sensibility.\n\n\tFor “Bowls, Boxes, Plates & Vessels,” Parker invited back artists who had previously exhibited to participate in a show about “the idea of a container as form.” An intergenerational mix of artists ranging from Magdalena Suarez Frimkess and Nancy Shaver to Ruby Neri and Shio Kusaka to Zachary Leener and Daisy Sheff wound up taking part. Continuing a larger interest in craft techniques, the gallery exhibited works in ceramic, ranging from small bowls that could be held in one’s hands to medium-size orb-like vases to large-scale sculptures. That the exhibition was sited in a domestic space added to its charm—and created unexpected resonance.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tNominees:\n\n\t“Galleon Trade”Silverlens, New YorkJune 26–August 23, 2025\n\n\t“This artwork did not sell.”Maxwell Graham/Essex Street, New YorkMarch 12–April 19, 2025\n\n\t“Trees Never End and Houses Never End”Sky High Farm, Germantown, New YorkJune 28–October 11, 2025\n\n\t“Vaginal Davis and ektor garcia: There’s Something About Maria”Adams and Ollman, Portland, OregonSeptember 20–November 2, 2024\n",

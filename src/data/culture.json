    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tDecember 1st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhile not every Open Cul­ture read­er dreams of mov­ing to Japan and becom­ing a wood­block print­mak­er, it’s a safe bet that at least a few of you enter­tain just such a fan­ta­sy from time to time. David Bull, a British-Born Cana­di­an who got his first expo­sure to the art of ukiyo‑e in his late twen­ties, actu­al­ly did it. Though he’s been liv­ing in Japan and steadi­ly pur­su­ing his art there since 1986, only in recent years has he become known around the world. That’s thanks to his YouTube chan­nel, which we’ve fea­tured here sev­er­al times before. In the video above, one of his most pop­u­lar, he lets his view­ers expe­ri­ence print­mak­ing from his point of view, see­ing what he sees and even hear­ing what he hears.\nThough Bull nor­mal­ly focus­es on the ear­ly stage carv­ing images into the blocks, here he spends about an hour on the final print­ing phase, going through a batch of eight sheets. As even a few min­utes’ view­ing reveals, this is a labor-inten­sive and thor­ough­ly ana­log process.\nThat impres­sion will be height­ened if you wear head­phones, since, as Bull explains, he shot the video while wear­ing in-ear micro­phones that record the sounds of the job just as he hears them. This par­tic­u­lar aspect of the pro­duc­tion required him to rise con­sid­er­ably ear­li­er than usu­al, in order to avoid the con­sid­er­able day­time noise on the streets of Tokyo right out­side his work­shop — and thus to more ful­ly sat­is­fy the large ASMR crowd.\nThe term ASMR, or “Autonomous Sen­so­ry Merid­i­an Response,” refers to a set of pleas­ing sen­sa­tions trig­gered by cer­tain kinds of sound, often those pro­duced by soft-spo­ken indi­vid­u­als like Bull or the kind of repet­i­tive, method­i­cal tool work he does. Chances are, many if not most of the almost 950,000 views this video has racked up so far have come from ASMR enthu­si­asts less inter­est­ed in Japan­ese wood­block print­ing per se than in the gen­er­al aes­thet­ic expe­ri­ence of watch­ing and lis­ten­ing to Japan­ese wood­block print­ing — at least at first. We all know how life can go: one day you’re check­ing out YouTube, just look­ing to relax, and the next you’re ensconced in Asakusa, hav­ing whol­ly devot­ed your­self to a three-and-a-half-mil­len­ni­um-year-old tra­di­tion­al art form.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch the Mak­ing of Japan­ese Wood­block Prints, from Start to Fin­ish, by a Long­time Tokyo Print­mak­er\nEnter a Dig­i­tal Archive of 213,000+ Beau­ti­ful Japan­ese Wood­block Prints\nA Col­lec­tion of Hokusai’s Draw­ings Are Being Carved Onto Wood­blocks & Print­ed for the First Time Ever\nWatch an Art Con­ser­va­tor Bring Clas­sic Paint­ings Back to Life in Intrigu­ing­ly Nar­rat­ed Videos\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tDecember 1st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nFor young chil­dren today, just as it was for gen­er­a­tions of their pre­de­ces­sors, noth­ing is quite so thrilling about their first vis­it to a Dis­ney theme park as catch­ing a glimpse of Mick­ey Mouse, Don­ald Duck, or anoth­er beloved char­ac­ter greet­ing them in real life. Cre­at­ing this mem­o­rable expe­ri­ence requires noth­ing more advanced than a well-trained employ­ee (or “cast mem­ber,” as the com­pa­ny puts it) in an over­sized cos­tume. Nev­er­the­less, effec­tive though it may be, it was­n’t part of Walt Dis­ney’s long-term vision. A true man of the Space Age, he looked ahead to the time — sure­ly not all too far in the future — when he could instead fill Dis­ney­land with reli­able, untir­ing, per­fect­ly life­like robots in the shape of ani­mals, human beings, or any­thing else besides.\nIn the event, Dis­ney only lived long enough to see his peo­ple cre­ate a mechan­i­cal ver­sion of Abra­ham Lin­coln, whose abil­i­ties were lim­it­ed to stand­ing up from his chair and deliv­er­ing a short speech. By the time that “audio-ani­ma­tron­ic” res­ur­rec­tion of the Unit­ed States’ six­teenth pres­i­dent was first pub­licly shown at the 1964 New York World’s Fair, its rumored devel­op­ment had already set off a num­ber of eth­i­cal and aes­thet­ic con­tro­ver­sies. Yet it worked so well — at least after its ear­ly, embar­rass­ing tech­ni­cal dif­fi­cul­ties were ironed out — that some atten­dees assumed that they were look­ing at an actor dressed up as Lin­coln, and even won­dered if the poor fel­low got tired doing the same rou­tine all day long.\nThis sto­ry is includ­ed in the video above from Defunct­land, a YouTube chan­nel that focus­es on amuse­ment-park-relat­ed fail­ures, espe­cial­ly those con­nect­ed with the Dis­ney empire. The Great Moments with Mr. Lin­coln show was a suc­cess, as was the all-robot­ic Hall of Pres­i­dents that opened at Dis­ney­land in 1971, a few years after Dis­ney’s death. But try as it might — and spend as much as it will — the com­pa­ny has yet to real­ize the vision that came to obsess its founder: in effect, that of cre­at­ing tech­no­log­i­cal life. Of course, Dis­ney was hard­ly the first to enter­tain such Promethean ambi­tions: mankind had already been try­ing to pull that trick off for quite some time, as evi­denced by the efforts, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, of minds like Leonar­do da Vin­ci and the medieval poly­math Al-Jazari.\n\n\n\t\n\nTo explain Dis­ney’s long, frus­trat­ed quest to cre­ate arti­fi­cial human beings — or mice, as the case may be — requires a good deal of his­tor­i­cal, eco­nom­ic, tech­no­log­i­cal, and even philo­soph­i­cal con­text. That’s just what Defunct­land cre­ator Kevin Per­jur­er does, and then some, in the doc­u­men­tary that com­pris­es the ear­li­er video from last year and its just-released sec­ond part above. Over its col­lec­tive run­time of six hours, he goes deep into a ques­tion of great inter­est to Dis­ney enthu­si­asts: what, exact­ly, has pre­vent­ed the most ambi­tious enter­tain­ment com­pa­ny in the world from per­fect­ing its automa­tons, even here in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry? But then, as those of us of a cer­tain age who have fond mem­o­ries of the rel­a­tive­ly crude likes of the Haunt­ed Man­sion and Pirates of the Caribbean (to say noth­ing of  non-Dis­ney oper­a­tions like Chuck. E Cheese) under­stand, per­fec­tion isn’t always the way to a child’s heart.\nvia Boing Boing\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nA Medieval Ara­bic Man­u­script Fea­tures the Designs for a “Per­pet­u­al Flute” and Oth­er Inge­nious Mechan­i­cal Devices\nThe Armored-Knight “Robot” Designed by Leonar­do da Vin­ci (cir­ca 1495)\n200-Year-Old Robots That Play Music, Shoot Arrows & Even Write Poems: Watch Automa­tons in Action\nThe First-Ever Look at the Orig­i­nal Dis­ney­land Prospec­tus\nDis­ney­land 1957: A Lit­tle Stroll Down Mem­o­ry Lane\nA Map of the Dis­ney Enter­tain­ment Empire Reveals the Deep Con­nec­tions Between Its Movies, Its Mer­chan­dise, Dis­ney­land & More (1967)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nEnigmatic landscapes and metaphysical scenes unfold in the work of Gideon Kiefer. On canvas and panel, the artist paints countrysides dotted with small fires, pensive figures, and natural phenomena seemingly detached from reality by varying degrees, such as a wave crashing inside of an architectural enclosure or a chunk of purple-tinted landscape floating inside of a celestial cube.\nKiefer is interested in the nature of time and the way we mark its passing. Many of the mysterious notations and framing devices he adds around his esoteric tableaux resemble quickly-scribbled notes, as if for remembering something important, or poetic extracts from diary entries.\n“B MF B”\nAt first glance, Kiefer’s scenes often present an initial sense of familiarity or recognition, but the longer one studies the composition, comprehension is gradually dismantled. Notes in the margins may or may not feel relevant, like a doodle on the edge of a document. Or perhaps the phrases and numbers are clues to some arcane puzzle, in which Kiefer presents seemingly disparate pieces for us to try to reassemble.\nWithin his spatially strange compositions, Kiefer incorporates themes around the climate crisis. As sea levels rise due to melting ice caps and weather patterns change due to warmer temperatures—among myriad other effects—ecological changes and disruptions increasingly affect not only the planet’s flora and fauna but our own communities.\nIn Kiefer’s atmospheric paintings, stormy waves, mercurial skies, monumental icebergs, and intense fires mirror how the planet is transforming. His pieces also consider how we remember both what has already happened to the planet and acknowledge what is happening right now.\nSee more on the artist’s website and Instagram.\n“The Wave” \n“Dead Rabbit”\n“The Fucking-Up Ritual”\n“Stop Fucking Around, Start Fucking Around”\n“Don’t Bang the Drum”\n“FILIP”\n“Parasite Killing Host”\n“Ich Möchte Ein Eisberg Sein”\n“Der Sohn”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The only two words you want to hear when you’re ravenous and seated at the laminate counter of a roadside diner.\nArtist Adrienna Matzeg takes this highly anticipated call as the basis for a new trio of punch-needle works. Through nostalgic embroidered tableaux, she whips up melty grilled cheese, waffles with a pat of butter, and a banana split with puffs of cream and not just one, but three cherries nested on top. \nDetail of “Sweet as Suga'”\nLike much of her earlier work, Order Up captures Matzeg’s keen interest in nostalgia and the welcome discoveries of a long car ride. “Inspired by North American roadside diners and late-night stops, each piece captures the essence of a greasy spoon,” she adds.\nWhether a cheap paper napkin or bottomless cup of coffee, the objects all appear to pop up from the delicately mottled backdrops, the painstakingly stitched shadows hugging their forms. \nFind more about Matzeg’s work on Tacit Collective, and keep up with her practice on Instagram.\nDetail of “House Special”\n“Sundae Best”\nDetail of “Sundae Best”\n“Sweet as Suga'”\n“House Special”\n“Sundae Best”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Students engage in both a rigorous research-based curriculum and hands-on learning, exploring creative approaches to teaching while building strong analytical skills and contributing academic research to the field.“What sets our program apart is its interdisciplinary nature. We welcome applicants from varied areas: performance, applied arts, museums, community arts organizations, K-12 teachers, artists, and other creative areas,” said Kathy J. Brown, graduate program director and endowed assistant professor of art education. “We want to foster art educators as positive changemakers who can help shape the culture and praxis of arts spaces. Moreover, our master’s program offers a high level of inquiry, essential for enhancing contemporary art education.”Outside the classroom, students gain hands-on experience with labs and initiatives such as the Center for the Study of Childhood Art and the Arkansas Art Educator Art Lab, which provides professional development for teachers across the state. They also participate in programs such as the Ink and Inspiration: A Student Writing Retreat, happening again this spring for all students, and the Art Education Symposium. Recently, art education and art history students collaborated for a week-long workshop with Nigerian artist Peju Layiwola, exploring resist-dyeing techniques and their significance within global histories of art education.“Our program is strengthened by the interdisciplinary exchange that happens across the School of Art,” said Christopher Schulte, interim program director and endowed professor of art education. “Students work closely with studio artists, graphic designers, and art historians, as well as leading scholars across campus, developing their research and establishing theory-practice relationships that test the pliability of art and its educational potential. Moreover, the varied professional backgrounds of the students admitted to the program make for a vibrant educational environment, reflect their identities as both educators and artists, and enable the program to foster new partnerships, projects, and possibilities.”The program is tied to the Northwest Arkansas arts ecosystem and has collaborated with numerous schools and community programs, such as the Arkansas Arts Academy and the Fayetteville Public Library, where students created an inclusive project with the nonprofit Life Styles, Inc. Supported by a transformational gift from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation, all MA students receive a tuition waiver, graduate assistantship, stipend, and access to funding and collaboration with visiting scholars.Alumni pursue careers in K-12 education, museum and community arts programming, nonprofit leadership and higher education, and many continue into doctoral programs. As demand grows for educators, the School of Art’s MA in Art Education provides a dynamic space with time, support, and mentorship to grow.Applications for the MA in Art Education are now open until January 15, 2026. To learn more, visit art.uark.edu or contact graduate program director Kathy J.

Last Thursday, the museum board approved the €10 (~$12) price hike for non-EU visitors, who make up the majority of the museum's annual attendance, starting January 14. The Louvre projects that the yearly multi-million-euro revenue increase will help fund its security system overhaul and massive renovation in the wake of the brazen daytime heist that took the institution by surprise. The museum raised its admission fees by €5 at the start of 2024, citing rising energy costs. Within weeks of its implementation, French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed the 2026 price hike for non-EU visitors as the museum would soon proceed with operation “Nouvelle Renaissance,” which will completely update its security and accessibility measures, temperature controls, and fire- and water-proofing throughout the building; alleviate pinch points for overcrowding and add additional entries; and, most notably, develop a new and improved visitor experience for the Mona Lisa, who will be getting her own room at long last.With an estimated price tag of up to €800 million (~$930 million), “Nouvelle Renaissance” was hatched in light of Louvre President Laurence des Cars's written warning to Macron elaborating on the museum's myriad shortcomings and necessary repairs. Following the theft of the nation's crown jewels in October, however, the museum's egregious security oversights have been publicized extensively after des Cars's testimony to the French Senate. Adding insult to injury, the museum was forced to temporarily shutter one of its Greek ceramics galleries in November to address structural problems from the floor above, further emphasizing the urgency for the Louvre's total overhaul.The museum did not immediately respond to Hyperallergic's request for comment. Per the BBC, the museum estimates that the forthcoming price hike will likely generate an additional more than €15 million (over ~$17.5 million) in annual revenue.In its 2024 report, 77% of the Louvre's 8.7 million visitors came from abroad — primarily from the United States (13%), China (6%), and countries directly neighboring France. Visitors from Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein are exempt from the increase on account of the nations' inclusion in the European Economic Area. The Louvre's $37 ticket price eclipses the current $30 baseline that has become the standard across museums in the United States. Certain French labor unions, including the CFDT culture unit, which represents certain staff at the Louvre, have criticized the museum's tiered pricing as \"absurd and unjust,\" arguing that “people from the Middle East will pay a higher price [than French visitors] to access foundational and symbolic works of their own culture.”  \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Louvre\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

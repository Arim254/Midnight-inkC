    "body": "\n\tin Animation, Art, Film |   \tDecember 11th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nYou may have seen every sin­gle one of Stu­dio Ghi­b­li’s ani­mat­ed films, going well beyond the Hayao Miyaza­ki-direct­ed My Neigh­bor Totoro, Spir­it­ed Away, and Kik­i’s Deliv­ery Ser­vice to the less wide­ly known but also charm­ing­ly craft­ed likes of Ocean Waves, My Neigh­bors the Yamadas, and The Cat Returns. Even so, the ques­tion remains: have you real­ly seen them all? Expe­ri­enc­ing them in the the­ater or on home video is only the first stage of the process. Ide­al­ly, each ele­ment of a Ghi­b­li movie should sub­se­quent­ly be appre­ci­at­ed in iso­la­tion and at length: by lis­ten­ing to the music, for exam­ple, hun­dreds of hours of which, avail­able to stream, we’ve pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture.\n\nStill, no mat­ter how cap­ti­vat­ing Joe Hisaishi’s scores may sound on their own, Ghi­b­li’s work is ulti­mate­ly made to be seen. Giv­en that 24 frames of their movies go by each sec­ond, it can be dif­fi­cult to pick up all the details their ani­ma­tors include in each and every one of them.\nHence the val­ue of the free archive of stills that the stu­dio first made avail­able online a few years ago, and that has steadi­ly expand­ed ever since. Though only avail­able in Japan­ese, it does­n’t present a great chal­lenge even to fans with no knowl­edge of the lan­guage to click on the poster of their Ghi­b­li film of choice, then to browse the vari­ety of down­load­able images asso­ci­at­ed with it.\n\nMany of these stills are drawn from high­ly mem­o­rable moments across the Ghi­b­li fil­mog­ra­phy: the chil­dren’s par­ty on the hero of Por­co Rosso’s beloved air­plane; the emer­gence of the kodama in Princess Mononoke; the defeat of the colos­sal Giant War­rior in Nau­si­caä of the Val­ley of the Wind (which pre­dates the stu­dio’s foun­da­tion, but in any case now seems to count hon­orar­i­ly among its pro­duc­tions); the sen­tient flame cook­ing a skil­let of bacon and eggs in Howl’s Mov­ing Cas­tle. Some of them have even been turned into wall­pa­per for video calls, down­load­able from a page of their own. There we have anoth­er way to add a touch of Stu­dio Ghi­b­li’s dis­tinc­tive vision to our every­day lives — and anoth­er source of inspi­ra­tion to watch through the movies them­selves one more time.\nEnter the archive of still images here.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nDe-Stress with 30 Min­utes of Relax­ing Visu­als from Direc­tor Hayao Miyaza­ki\nA Vir­tu­al Tour Inside the Hayao Miyazaki’s Stu­dio Ghi­b­li Muse­um\nA Tour of Stu­dio Ghibli’s Brand New Theme Park in Japan, Which Re-Cre­ates the Worlds of Spir­it­ed Away, My Neigh­bor Totoro, and Oth­er Clas­sics\nSoft­ware Used by Hayao Miyazaki’s Ani­ma­tion Stu­dio Becomes Open Source & Free to Down­load\nStream Hun­dreds of Hours of Stu­dio Ghi­b­li Movie Music That Will Help You Study, Work, or Sim­ply Relax: My Neigh­bor Totoro, Spir­it­ed Away & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Archaeology, History |   \tDecember 12th, 2025  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWe did­n’t have civ­i­liza­tion until we had cities, and we did­n’t have cities until we had agri­cul­ture. So, at least, goes a wide­ly accept­ed nar­ra­tive in “big his­to­ry” — a nar­ra­tive some­what trou­bled by the dis­cov­ery of ruins on Göbek­li Tepe, or “Pot­bel­ly Hill,” in south­east­ern Turkey. Appar­ent­ly inhab­it­ed from around 9500 to 8000 BC, the ancient set­tle­ment pre­dates the Pyra­mids of Giza by near­ly 8,000 years, and Stone­henge by about 6,000 years. Though it was once believed to be a site used for rit­u­al pur­pos­es only, lat­er research unearthed evi­dence that sug­gests it was host to a vari­ety of activ­i­ties we asso­ciate with urban civ­i­liza­tion, rather than what we usu­al­ly think of hunter-gath­er­er sites. Does it amount to rea­son enough to revise our very under­stand­ing of the his­to­ry of human­i­ty?\n“Like Stone­henge, Göbek­li Tepe’s struc­ture includes cir­cles of T‑shaped lime­stone pil­lars, many of them fea­tur­ing etch­ings of ani­mals,” says YouTu­ber Joe Scott in the video above. These pil­lars are arranged into enclo­sures, which togeth­er con­sti­tute a site that “fea­tures archae­o­log­i­cal com­plex­i­ty that prob­a­bly would have been too advanced for hunter-gath­er­ers.”\nKlaus Schmidt, the archae­ol­o­gist who led the exca­va­tions at Göbek­li Tepe between 1996 and 2014, believed that it was “a sanc­tu­ary and maybe a region­al pil­grim­age cen­ter where peo­ple gath­ered to per­form reli­gious rites.” But since his death, evi­dence of hous­es, a cis­tern, and grain-pro­cess­ing tools has turned up, indi­cat­ing “a ful­ly fledged set­tle­ment with per­ma­nent occu­pa­tion” well before the advent of farm­ing. This find­ing indi­cates that social and tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tions asso­ci­at­ed with ‘civ­i­liza­tion’ may have emerged long before the advent of agri­cul­ture, cities, or domes­ti­cat­ed ani­mals — under con­di­tions very dif­fer­ent from what his­to­ri­ans had pre­vi­ous­ly assumed. But as to the rea­son it was all built in the first place, this new infor­ma­tion has led to more ques­tions than answers.\nOne less than gen­er­al­ly accept­ed the­o­ry holds that Göbek­li Tepe was an astro­nom­i­cal obser­va­to­ry, and per­haps also a memo­r­i­al to a dev­as­tat­ing comet strike that occurred 13,000 years ago. Maybe it was “a last-ditch effort by a hunter-gath­er­er soci­ety to hang on to their van­ish­ing lifestyle as the world was tran­si­tion­ing to farm­ing.” That could have been the first large-scale tech­no­log­i­cal rev­o­lu­tion in human his­to­ry, but it cer­tain­ly would­n’t be the last, and as we here in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­sid­er the ruins of Göbek­li Tepe — most of which still have yet to be exca­vat­ed — we nat­u­ral­ly find our­selves think­ing about the long-term sur­vival prospects of our own civ­i­liza­tion. But the more recent dis­cov­ery else­where in Turkey of oth­er, even old­er ruins with a dis­tinct­ly urban struc­ture may also make us feel that our way of life isn’t quite as mod­ern as we’d imag­ined.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nExplore the Ruins of Tim­gad, the “African Pom­peii” Exca­vat­ed from the Sands of Alge­ria\nWatch Ancient Ruins Get Restored to their Glo­ri­ous Orig­i­nal State with Ani­mat­ed GIFs: The Tem­ple of Jupiter, Lux­or Tem­ple & More\nPom­peii Rebuilt: A Tour of the Ancient City Before It Was Entombed by Mount Vesu­vius\nHow Civ­i­liza­tions Built on Top of Each Oth­er: Dis­cov­er What Lies Beneath Rome, Troy & Oth­er Cities\nA Cul­tur­al Tour of Istan­bul, Where the Art and His­to­ry of Three Great Empires Come Togeth­er\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er a 2,400-Year-Old Skele­ton Mosa­ic That Urges Peo­ple to “Be Cheer­ful and Live Your Life”\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Archaeology, History, Life |   \tDecember 11th, 2025  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nThe site Fast Com­pa­ny pub­lished an arti­cle that describes the “Com­plaint Restraint project,” an ini­tia­tive that aims to cre­ate a “pos­i­tive life by elim­i­nat­ing neg­a­tive state­ments.” It’s an admirable goal. Though most of us have a per­verse love of wal­low­ing in our misery—a human trait ampli­fied a thou­sand­fold by the internet—complaining rarely makes things any bet­ter. As in the Buddha’s para­ble of the “sec­ond arrow,” our grip­ing can make our suf­fer­ings dou­bly painful; as in the para­ble of the “poi­soned arrow,” it can post­pone or sub­sti­tute for the con­struc­tive actions we need to take in order to heal or improve our con­di­tion.\nBut it would be a mis­take to think that com­plain­ing is some­how a recent phe­nom­e­non, though we may hear more of it every day, all the time, from every quar­ter of the globe. The Bud­dhist arrow sto­ries are, after all, at least a cou­ple thou­sand years old; lamen­ta­tion more or less con­sti­tutes its own genre in Bib­li­cal lit­er­a­ture.\nEven old­er still than these reli­gious sources is the first doc­u­ment­ed cus­tomer ser­vice com­plaint, a spe­cif­ic vari­ety of com­plain­ing that we might be for­giv­en for asso­ci­at­ing main­ly with a mod­ern, con­sumerist age—and one of the few kinds of com­plaints that can gen­er­ate pos­i­tive results.\nAbsent a Yelp app, the ancient Baby­lon­ian con­sumer in this case inscribed his com­plaint on a clay tablet—which now resides at the British Muse­um—some­time around 1750 B.C. The irate pur­chas­er here, Nan­ni, writ­ing to some­one named Ea-nasir, received a ship­ment of cop­per ore of an infe­ri­or grade, after some annoy­ing delay and in a dam­aged con­di­tion. In the trans­la­tion below from Assyri­ol­o­gist A. Leo Oppen­heim, Nan­ni vents his spleen.\nTell Ea-nasir: Nan­ni sends the fol­low­ing mes­sage:\nWhen you came, you said to me as fol­lows : “I will give Gim­il-Sin (when he comes) fine qual­i­ty cop­per ingots.” You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my mes­sen­ger (Sit-Sin) and said: “If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!”\nWhat do you take me for, that you treat some­body like me with such con­tempt? I have sent as mes­sen­gers gen­tle­men like our­selves to col­lect the bag with my mon­ey (deposit­ed with you) but you have treat­ed me with con­tempt by send­ing them back to me emp­ty-hand­ed sev­er­al times, and that through ene­my ter­ri­to­ry. Is there any­one among the mer­chants who trade with Tel­mun who has treat­ed me in this way? You alone treat my mes­sen­ger with con­tempt! On account of that one (tri­fling) mina of sil­ver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have giv­en to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of cop­per, and umi-abum has like­wise giv­en 1,080 pounds of cop­per, apart from what we both have had writ­ten on a sealed tablet to be kept in the tem­ple of Samas.\nHow have you treat­ed me for that cop­per? You have with­held my mon­ey bag from me in ene­my ter­ri­to­ry; it is now up to you to restore (my mon­ey) to me in full.\nTake cog­nizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any cop­per from you that is not of fine qual­i­ty. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots indi­vid­u­al­ly in my own yard, and I shall exer­cise against you my right of rejec­tion because you have treat­ed me with con­tempt.\nIt does seem that Nan­ni maybe took this poor ser­vice a lit­tle too per­son­al­ly. In any case, let’s hope he received some sat­is­fac­tion for the trou­ble it must have tak­en to inscribe this angry mes­sage.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMark Twain Drafts the Ulti­mate Let­ter of Com­plaint (1905)\nHunter S.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen designer Pedro Neves was an undergraduate student, he attended an advanced seminar during which students were charged with creating an alphabet using modular elements. “As someone with minimal experience with type design, I was struck by the excitement of generating letterforms simply by using pre-existing modules,” he says in a statement. Little did he know that the assignment would spur an international participatory and educational project.\nIn his faculty role at the University of Illinois Chicago’s School of Design, Neves organized a graduate course emphasizing modularity for letterform design and typographic compositions. LEGO turned out to be an ideal system, comprising individual elements that operate on a grid and exist in numerous shapes.\nComplete ‘A2Z’ alphabet\n“The system offered an ideal blend of fixed constraints and room for playful exploration. Each brick’s scale and form could not be altered, but the grid’s size could be individually defined,” Neves says. “Students were free to arrange and join bricks, building up their compositions.” It didn’t hurt that they were enthusiastic about LEGO to begin with. And using more portable, inexpensive tools like Provisional Press kits allowed for even more flexibility.\nNeves’ desire to explore the potential of LEGO in print led to further collaborations with designers from around the world, each of whom he challenged to create a distinctive letterform. These contributions, submitted from 36 individual designers or studios on six continents, are now compiled in a publication called A2Z: Learning Through LEGO® and Letterforms, which is complemented by an exhibition currently on view at the Design Museum of Chicago.\nNeves offered to send participants a physical LEGO set so they could tinker with ideas by hand. Then, for their final designs, which could be layered up to three times to achieve different colors and effects, the designers could use five colors loosely based on CMYK, which Neves selected from the Pantone color system. Every letterform incorporates some combination or selection of aqua, red, yellow, purple, and green.\nEunice Chong, for example, rendered a verdant “R” and shares that her piece embodies aspects of the urban identity and cultural heritage of Singapore, where she calls home. “I drew inspiration from the patterns of Peranakan tiles, known for their ornate designs,” she says. “The floral and greenery elements reflect Singapore’s reputation as a Garden City, where nature is thoughtfully integrated into its urban landscape.”\nJennifer Wandro\nOnce the designers had created their pieces, they returned digital templates to Neves so that the compositions could be set up using physical bricks and run through a large press in the UIC print lab. The process involved over 8,000 bricks and more than 27,000 hand-operated printing passes that took Neves and his students eight months to complete. \nThe exhibition at Design Museum of Chicago displays the original LEGO letterform constructions alongside their letterpress prints. Plan your visit on the museum’s website, and see more of Neves’ work on Instagram and his website, where he has shared extensive open-source information about the project.\nYou might also enjoy Roy Scholten’s LEGO letterpress birds.\nEunice Chong\nThe printing process in the UIC print lab\nNaz Naddaf + Nabil Nasr\nRaven Mo\nStudio Dobra (João Guedes)\nThe printing process in the UIC print lab\nD Josh Cook\nThe printing process in the UIC print lab\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

In return, he received more responses than expected, many of which tapped into passionate displays of pleasure and pain. “It was like finding a secret window into our collective psyches,” he writes. \nThese submissions spawned a tender project in collaboration with musician Félix Gerbelot and animator Masanobu Hiraoka. A multi-part endeavor spanning an album and digital installation, On Being opens with a poignant music video. “It started from the sound of Felix Gerbelot’s viola and eventually became the title track of the album,” Cooper shares.\n\n\n\nPaired with the meditative instrumentals, Hiraoka’s monochromatic visuals appear to emerge from a single line, leading viewers on a swirling journey of growth and loss. While the film references what Cooper’s community had shared, it also incorporates Hiraoka’s own family videos through rotoscoping, a technique that involves tracing over live-action footage frame by frame. \n“At first, I planned to create random cuts and gradually link them together. But as I worked, the concept itself evolved, and in the end, I focused more on vivid personal memories,” Hiraoka told It’s Nice That. \nThe result is a tender portrait of universal human emotion, one that races through the birth and development of a child. Energetic and dynamic, the animation gives the feeling of being a bit too quick to allow viewers to savor any singular moment, instead resigning us to a chaotic swirl of time passing.\nFind more of On Being on the project website.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAn unwavering desire to play with scale, permanence, and fragility recurs in Rebecca Manson’s practice. The New York-based artist (previously) is known for magnifying the minuscule and preserving fleeting lifeforms in porcelain, a material regarded for both its resilience and delicacy. These dichotomies emerge through dynamic sculptures of butterflies and moths that drape down walls and across floors in dramatic displays.\nEach wing is comprised of tens of thousands of small, hand-crafted pieces Manson and her team refer to as “smushes.” Layered into undulating compositions, these individual pieces mimic the lush texture of scales and the protective patterns of disguise some species use to hide from predators.\nDetail of “Blue Admiral Wing” (2025)\nManson’s newest body of work is on view next month at Jessica Silverman. Time, You Must Be Laughing takes its name from Joni Mitchell’s 1975 poetic song “Sweet Bird,” which invokes the constancy of change. Works like “Blue Admiral Wing” nest larger, almost agate-like components within rippling lines of smushes, while lustrous and dichroic glazes lend themselves to glimmering, iridescent surfaces.\nFor Manson, understanding that decay is inevitable doesn’t diminish nature’s beauty or intrigue. Instead, her sculptures invite us to get lost in the minute intricacies of each form, embracing the striking, rippling forms as they are in the moment.\nTime, You Must Be Laughing runs from January 8 to February 28 in San Francisco.

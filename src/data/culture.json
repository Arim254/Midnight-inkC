    "body": "\n\tin Art, Life |   \tJanuary 9th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nTrevor Noah end­ed his stint as the host of The Dai­ly Show a lit­tle over three years ago, but he’s made him­self into anoth­er kind of pop-cul­tur­al pres­ence since then. In evi­dence, we have his appear­ance above on the pop­u­lar pod­cast and YouTube show Diary of a CEO. For more than two and a half hours, Noah dis­cuss­es with host Steven Bartlett (who, like Noah, also hap­pens to be African-born with mixed parent­age) his rea­sons for quit­ting that polit­i­cal-news-com­e­dy TV insti­tu­tion, his strug­gles with depres­sion, and the time his step­fa­ther shot his moth­er in the head. She lived, owing to the mirac­u­lous­ly unlike­ly tra­jec­to­ry of the bul­let, but that did­n’t stop the expe­ri­ence from becom­ing what Noah describes as the worst of his life.\nDis­cussing all this brings to his mind the Japan­ese art of kintsu­gi (pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture). “It’s a prac­tice of repair­ing pot­tery and ceram­ics that have bro­ken,” Noah explains. “What hap­pens is, you break a plate, or you break a vase or some­thing,” and “they put it back togeth­er, these arti­sans who do it. But they don’t just glue it back togeth­er, they glue it back togeth­er and they sort of adorn it with a gold­en bind­ing. And what you get is an object that is some­how more beau­ti­ful than before it was bro­ken.”\nKintsu­gi struck him as “one of the most beau­ti­ful con­cepts, and a dif­fer­ent way to think about being ‘fixed’ or ‘over­com­ing’ ”; it was­n’t “the idea that we are per­fect, the way we were before some­thing hap­pened to us, but rather, it is that we get to wear our cracks with a new type of pride, and a new type of beau­ty.”\nNoah would hard­ly be the only per­son to see in these recon­sti­tut­ed ceram­ic ves­sels with their gleam­ing kintsu­gi seams a metaphor for him­self. Like more than a few pub­lic fig­ures in the West, he’s been will­ing to dis­cuss the vicis­si­tudes of his life in detail, and even use them for mate­r­i­al in work like his stand-up com­e­dy and his mem­oir Born a Crime. But it is unusu­al, in a chat like this with mil­lions and mil­lions of view­ers, to hear ref­er­ence made to a half-mil­len­ni­um-old Japan­ese form of pot­tery repair. That pos­si­bil­i­ty, of course, is cen­tral to the appeal of long-form inter­view pod­casts, whose con­ver­sa­tions have the time and space to go far down unex­pect­ed paths. The Dai­ly Show may deliv­er more laughs per minute, but giv­en its for­mat’s time con­straints, kintsu­gi-type talk is no doubt the first thing to get edit­ed out — and the cut cer­tain­ly won’t be high­light­ed.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nA Visu­al Intro­duc­tion to Kintsu­gi, the Japan­ese Art of Repair­ing Bro­ken Pot­tery and Find­ing Beau­ty in Imper­fec­tion\nHow Japan­ese Kintsu­gi Mas­ters Restore Pot­tery by Beau­ti­fy­ing the Cracks\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nStanford’s Robert Sapol­sky Demys­ti­fies Depres­sion, Which, Like Dia­betes, Is Root­ed in Biol­o­gy\nStephen Fry on Cop­ing with Depres­sion: It’s Rain­ing, But the Sun Will Come Out Again\nCharles Bukows­ki Explains How to Beat Depres­sion: Spend 3–4 Days in Bed and You’ll Get the Juices Flow­ing Again (NSFW)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Education, Games |   \tJanuary 8th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs any new par­ent soon finds out, there exists a robust mar­ket for prod­ucts, ser­vices, and media that promise to boost a child’s intel­li­gence. Some of these offer­ings come as close as legal­ly pos­si­ble to hold­ing out the promise of putting any tot on the path to genius, brazen­ly beg­ging the ques­tion of whether it’s pos­si­ble to raise a genius in the first place. Still, the efforts par­ents have delib­er­ate­ly made in that direc­tion have occa­sion­al­ly pro­duced notable results, from epochal fig­ures like Mozart or John Stu­art Mill to the promis­ing-math­e­mati­cian-turned-street­car-trans­fer-obsessed-recluse William Sidis. More recent­ly came the Pol­gár sis­ters, who were suc­cess­ful­ly raised to become some of the great­est female chess play­ers in his­to­ry.\nHav­ing stud­ied the nature of intel­li­gence at uni­ver­si­ty, their father Lás­zló got it in his head that, since most genius­es start­ed learn­ing their sub­jects inten­sive­ly and ear­ly, par­ents could cul­ti­vate genius-lev­el per­for­mance in their chil­dren by direct­ing that learn­ing process them­selves. He sought out a wife both intel­lec­tu­al­ly promis­ing and will­ing to devote her­self to test­ing this hypoth­e­sis. Togeth­er they went on to father three daugh­ters, putting them through a rig­or­ous, cus­tom-made edu­ca­tion ori­ent­ed toward chess mas­tery. Chess became the pro­jec­t’s cen­tral sub­ject in large part because of its sheer objec­tiv­i­ty, all the bet­ter for Lás­zló Pol­gár to mea­sure the results of this domes­tic exper­i­ment.\nNor could it have hurt, giv­en the impor­tance of retain­ing the inter­est of chil­dren, that chess was a game — and one with evoca­tive toy-like pieces — that offers imme­di­ate feed­back and feel­ings of accom­plish­ment. For his daugh­ters, Pol­gár has empha­sized, learn­ing involved none of the drudgery and busy­work of school. “A child does not like only play: for them it is also enjoy­able to acquire infor­ma­tion and solve prob­lems,” he writes in his book Raise a Genius! “A child’s work can also be enjoy­able; so can learn­ing, if it is suf­fi­cient­ly moti­vat­ing, and if it means a con­stant sup­ply of prob­lems to solve that are appro­pri­ate for the lev­el of the child’s needs. A child does not need play sep­a­rate from work, but mean­ing­ful action.”\nThe proof of Pol­gár’s the­o­ries is in the pud­ding — or at any rate, in the rat­ings. All three of his daugh­ters became elite chess play­ers. Sofia, the mid­dle one, became the sixth-strongest female play­er in the world; Susan, the eldest, the top-ranked female play­er in the world; Judit, the youngest, the strongest female chess play­er of all time. This despite the fact that their father was an unex­cep­tion­al chess play­er, and their moth­er not a chess play­er at all. Some eager­ly take the sto­ry of the Pol­gár sis­ters as a vin­di­ca­tion of nur­ture over nature; oth­ers, sci­en­tif­ic researchers includ­ed, argue that it only shows that prac­tice is a nec­es­sary con­di­tion for this kind of genius, not a suf­fi­cient one. For my part, hav­ing kept an eye on a pair of infant twins while writ­ing this, I’d be hap­py if my own kids could just mas­ter hold­ing on to their bot­tles.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nLearn How to Play Chess Online: Free Chess Lessons for Begin­ners, Inter­me­di­ate Play­ers & Beyond\nMeet Alma Deutsch­er, the Clas­si­cal Music Prodi­gy: Watch Her Per­for­mances from Age 6 to 14\nThe Mag­ic of Chess: Kids Share Their Unin­hib­it­ed, Philo­soph­i­cal Insights about the Ben­e­fits of Chess\nHear the Pieces Mozart Com­posed When He Was Only 5 Years Old\nRead an 18th-Cen­tu­ry Eye­wit­ness Account of 8‑Year-Old Mozart’s Extra­or­di­nary Musi­cal Skills\nThe Renewed Pop­u­lar­i­ty of Chess and The Queen’s Gam­bit: Pret­ty Much Pop Cul­ture Pod­cast Dis­cus­sion #78 with Chess Expert J.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs much as it is about every part of Dublin that ever passed by James Joyce’s once-young eyes, Ulysses is also a book about books, and about writ­ing and speech—as myth­ic invo­ca­tion, as seduc­tion, chat­ter, and rhetoric, ful­some and emp­ty. Words—two-faced, like open books—carry with them at least two sens­es, the mean­ing of their present utter­ance, and the ver­so shades of his­to­ry. This is at least part­ly the import of Joyce’s myth­i­cal method, as it is that of all expos­i­tors of ancient texts, from preach­ers and the­olo­gians to lit­er­ary crit­ics. It seems par­tic­u­lar­ly sig­nif­i­cant, then, that the pas­sage Joyce chose for the one and only record­ing of a read­ing from Ulysses comes from the “Aeo­lus” episode, which par­o­dies Odysseus and his com­pan­ions’ encounter with the god of wind.\nJoyce sets the scene in the news­pa­per offices of the Freeman’s Jour­nal, epit­o­me of writ­ing in the present tense, where reporters and edi­tors give puffed-up speech­es punc­tu­at­ed by reduc­tive, pithy head­lines. Amidst this busi­ness, eru­dite pro­fes­sor MacHugh and Stephen Dedalus wax lit­er­ary and his­tor­i­cal, mak­ing con­nec­tions. MacHugh recites “the finest dis­play of ora­to­ry” he ever heard—a defense of the revival of the Irish lan­guage that com­pares the Irish peo­ple to Moses and the ancient Hebrews spurn­ing the seduc­tions of an oppres­sive empire in the per­son of an Egypt­ian high priest: Vagrants and day­labour­ers are you called: the world trem­bles at our name.\nJoyce record­ed the pas­sage in 1924 at the urg­ing of Shake­speare and Com­pa­ny founder Sylvia Beach, who per­suad­ed the HMV gramo­phone stu­dio in Paris to make the record, under the pro­vi­sion that she would finance it and that the studio’s name would appear nowhere on the prod­uct. Ulysses, recall, was in many places under a ban for obscen­i­ty (not lift­ed in the U.S. until 1933 by Judge John Woolsey). The record­ing ses­sion was painful for Joyce, who need­ed two attempts on two sep­a­rate days to com­plete it, plagued as he was by his fail­ing eyes. And yet Joyce, Beach wrote in her notes, “was anx­ious to have the record­ing made… He had made up his mind, he told me, that this would be his only read­ing from Ulysses… it is more, one feels, than mere ora­to­ry.” You can read the speech here while lis­ten­ing to Joyce read above. Beach called Joyce’s read­ing a “won­der­ful per­for­mance.” “I nev­er hear it,” she wrote, “with­out being deeply moved.”\n\n\n\t\n\nWhile Beach may have been sat­is­fied with the record­ing, her friend, lin­guist C.K. Ogden pro­nounced it “very bad,” mean­ing, writes Beach, “it was not a suc­cess tech­ni­cal­ly” (though it was not, in any case, “at all a com­mer­cial ven­ture”). You will notice this imme­di­ate­ly as you strug­gle to hear Joyce’s mut­ed read­ing. Anx­ious to pre­serve his voice in a clear­er doc­u­ment, Ogden cap­tured Joyce read­ing from Finnegans Wake five years lat­er at the stu­dio of the Ornitho­log­i­cal Soci­ety in Cam­bridge (he boast­ed of own­ing “the two biggest record­ing machines in the world”). By this time, Joyce’s eye­sight had almost com­plete­ly dimmed. Ogden pho­tographed the text and enlarged it so that the let­ters were a half-inch tall, yet Joyce still could bare­ly make them out and “sup­pos­ed­ly need­ed some­one to whis­per along” (Beach, who was not present, imag­ined he must have known the pas­sage by heart).\nJoyce chose to read from the “Anna Livia Plura­belle” sec­tion of the exper­i­men­tal text—a pas­sage “over­flow­ing,” writes Men­tal Floss, with “allu­sions to the world’s rivers.” He reads in the voice of an old wash­er­woman, and begins with a most suc­cinct state­ment of the tem­po­ral dimen­sions of lan­guage: “I told you every telling has a tail­ing.” Where Ulysses fore­grounds lit­er­ary his­to­ry, Finnegans Wake dives deep into geo­log­ic time, and priv­i­leges the oral over the writ­ten. These are the only two record­ings Joyce ever made, and they sure­ly mark what were for him cen­tral loca­tions in both books, though he also chose them for their ease of read­ing aloud and, per­haps, mem­o­riz­ing.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nJames Joyce, With His Eye­sight Fail­ing, Draws a Sketch of Leopold Bloom (1926)\nSylvia Beach Tells the Sto­ry of Found­ing Shake­speare and Com­pa­ny, Pub­lish­ing Joyce’s Ulysses, Sell­ing Copies of Hemingway’s First Book & More (1962)\nHear All of Finnegans Wake Read Aloud: A 35 Hour Read­ing\nWhat Makes James Joyce’s Ulysses a Mas­ter­piece: Great Books Explained\nVir­ginia Woolf on James Joyce’s Ulysses, “Nev­er Did Any Book So Bore Me.” Shen Then Quit at Page 200\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThibaut Grevet is a French director and photographer who moves through the world with an eye tuned to the unseen. His images slip between reality and reverie, blending people, architecture, and landscape into quiet collisions of shape, shadow, and motion. What he captures often feels less like documentation and more like memory—soft, shifting, and charged with an otherworldly calm.\nGrevet works in moments that unfold on their own terms: unposed, unpolished, and beautifully transient. He gravitates toward what flickers at the edge of perception, revealing details that many overlook but that, in his hands, expand into entire worlds. His 2025–26 collaboration with New York City Ballet extends this dialogue between space and sensation.\nGrevet’s work will be on view at three special New York City Ballet Art Series performances on January 28, January 31, and February 6. The evenings will include a performance, viewing of the installation, and an afterparty, with all tickets priced at $54.\nTo learn more and purchase tickets, visit nycballet.com/artseries.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn an otherwise unassuming neighborhood in Beppu, Ōita Prefecture, Japan, a modest residence has undergone an unusual transformation. Thanks to Japanese art collective 目, the two-story private home has been hollowed out, in a sense, to create a literal cavern.\n目 translates to “eye” and is pronounced “mé,” and the group comprises artist Haruka Kojin, director Kenji Minamigawa, and installer Hirofumi Masui. The trio’s focus revolves around conceiving works that encourage new ways of seeing the world as it constantly changes and evolves before us. Often playing with perception, pieces have included ocean swells that appear frozen in time and space and giant balloons of people’s faces that float above urban centers.\n\n“Space II” sits in a residential neighborhood of a city renowned for its natural hot springs, known as onsen, which attract visitors to local resorts. Tapping into the geological and geothermal character of the area, 目 has created an otherworldly installation resembling a cave reminiscent of tourist attractions with metal steps and railings. Gaping holes in the exterior make it appear as if the structure was carved from rock to look like a house rather than the other way around.\n“Space II” is a continuation of a theme begun with a piece called “Space” in 2020, in which 目 constructed a narrow, contemporary exhibition space in the second story of an otherwise typical home in the city of Aomori. Visitors will be able to step inside of “Space II,” with reservations slated to open on 目’s website later this month. Follow updates on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nBy marrying the realistic with the fantastical and uncanny, Stephanie Temma Hier conjures tension: there’s a calf-hair necktie that morphs into a table fan, popcorn surrounding pink ballet shoes, and a rapt snake framed by orange igneous rocks.\nThe Brooklyn-based artist is formally trained as a painter and self-taught as a ceramicist, and she fuses the two modes of working into a complementary practice. Hier begins by sculpting a wide range of forms, and after several rounds of firing with both handmade and commercially available glazes, she adds a painting. The pairings arise intuitively, sometimes through free association, trial and error, or by homing in on a color.\n\nEarlier works include a decadent, three-tiered cake piped not with pillowy buttercream but instead trimmed with olives, sausages, and thin slices of prosciutto. There’s also a thick head of green cabbage that reveals a trio of ravenous chicks roosted in its core. While the artist’s depictions in both clay and paint are lifelike, the juxtapositions push the works firmly into the realm of the surreal and ambiguous.\nMany of the works shown here will debut this month at Anton Kern Gallery for Hier’s solo exhibition, Swan Song. Nodding to the ancient Greek belief that the otherwise “mute” birds sing just before their deaths, the exhibition takes transformation as its starting point. Elements of Dutch still lifes appear, too, as flowers bloom and pastries and coffee are consumed across a picnic-esque surface.\nHier created the Swan Song pieces simultaneously, allowing motifs and themes to recur throughout. The titular bird, for example, appears in several works, from the feathered chair with thick, stocky webbed legs to the intimate portrait encircled by an array of speckled shoes. Together, the mixed-media pieces create a sort of domestic tableau that unsettles in its familiarity, presenting a fantastic world in which the only inevitabilities are the unexpected and change.\nSwan Song is on view from January 14 to February 21 in New York.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe world’s largest island that isn’t its own continent, Greenland spans more than 836,000 square miles. As we’ve been reminded recently, the territory is part of the Realm of Denmark, although it has its own systems of local government. Greenland is home to only about 56,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Inuit and live on the southern part of the island that’s not covered in ice. The largest city, Nuuk, houses around one-third of the country’s population. And situated just south of the Arctic Circle, residents only see a few hours of sunlight during the day in mid-winter.\nHunting and fishing have traditionally sustained a subsistence lifestyle for Greenlanders, and today, the latter continues as the foundation of the nation’s economy. It’s a stunning island, with dramatic mountains, fjords, and rocky coastlines. For photographer Dennis Lehtonen, who moved to Greenland in early 2023 and found work in its fish factories, the inherent beauty of the region is endlessly enchanting.\nNarsamijit\nLehtonen captures atmospheric images of distinctive landscapes and tiny villages, like when a pair of monumental icebergs floated by one community earlier this year. He illuminates the vernacular architecture and remote, rugged beauty of the country while drawing attention to changing demographics.\nLike many places around the world, populations are declining in rural, small towns due to younger people moving away to larger cities for different job opportunities, creating a domino effect of industry decline in smaller settlements. In many areas, a number of homes stand abandoned, and since the mid-20th century, a few ghost towns have emerged.\nUsing a drone, Lehtonen captures these otherworldly places where time-honored traditions confront our contemporary, globalized world. He aims to photograph all of the approximately 70 inhabited places in Greenland, creating a kind of poignant record.\n“With many young people moving to a few bigger cities, it means that many smaller, remote places experience severe depopulation,” Lehtonen says. “It’s therefore highly realistic that some places I have lived in will be closed as I get older.” See more on Instagram.\nKullorsuaq\nSavissivik\nTasiusaq\nSiorapaluk\n\t\n\t\n\t",

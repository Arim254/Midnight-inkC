    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 30th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nGrant­ed access to a time machine, few of us would pre­sum­ably opt first for the expe­ri­ence of skull surgery by the Incas. Yet our chances of sur­vival would be bet­ter than if we under­went the same pro­ce­dure 400 years lat­er, at least if it took place on a Civ­il War bat­tle­field. In both fif­teenth-cen­tu­ry Peru and the nine­teenth-cen­tu­ry Unit­ed States, sur­geons were per­form­ing a lot of trepa­na­tion, or removal of a por­tion of the skull. Since the Neolith­ic peri­od, indi­vid­u­als had been trepanned for a vari­ety of rea­sons, some of which now sound more med­ical­ly com­pelling than oth­ers, but the Incan civ­i­liza­tion took it to anoth­er lev­el of fre­quen­cy, and indeed sophis­ti­ca­tion.\nAny­one with an inter­est in the his­to­ry of tech­nol­o­gy would do well to study the Incas, who were remark­able in both what they devel­oped and what they did­n’t. Though there was no Incan alpha­bet, there was khipu, (or quipu), pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, a sys­tem of record-keep­ing that used noth­ing but knot­ted cords.\nThe Incas may not have had wheeled vehi­cles or mechan­i­cal devices as we know them today, but they did have pre­ci­sion mason­ry, an exten­sive road sys­tem, advanced water man­age­ment for agri­cul­tur­al and oth­er uses, high-qual­i­ty tex­tiles, and plant-derived anti­sep­tic — some­thing more than a lit­tle use­ful if you also hap­pen to be cut­ting a lot of holes in peo­ple’s skulls.\nStudy­ing the his­to­ry of trepa­na­tion, neu­rol­o­gist David Kush­n­er, along with bioar­chae­ol­o­gists John Ver­a­no and Anne Titel­baum, exam­ined more than 600 Peru­vian skulls dat­ing from between 400 BC and the mid-six­teenth-cen­tu­ry, which marked the end of the Incans’ 133-year-long run. As Sci­ence’s Lizzie Wade reports, the old­est evi­dence shows an unen­vi­able 40% sur­vival rate, but the sur­gi­cal tech­nique evolved over time: by the Inca era, the num­ber ris­es to between 75% and 83%, as against 46% to 56% in Civ­il War mil­i­tary hos­pi­tals. Some Incan skulls even show signs of hav­ing under­gone up to sev­en suc­cess­ful trepa­na­tions — or non-fatal ones, at any rate. Though that ven­er­a­ble form of surgery may no longer be prac­ticed, mod­ern neu­ro­sur­geons today use tech­niques based on the same prin­ci­ples. Should we find our­selves in need of their ser­vices, we’ll no doubt pre­fer to keep our dis­tance from the time machine.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nDis­cov­er Khipu, the Ancient Incan Record & Writ­ing Sys­tem Made Entire­ly of Knots\nBehold the Medieval Wound Man: The Poor Soul Who Illus­trat­ed the Injuries a Per­son Might Receive Through War, Acci­dent or Dis­ease\nJazz Musi­cian Plays Acoustic Gui­tar While Under­go­ing Brain Surgery, Help­ing Doc­tors Mon­i­tor Their Progress\nArti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence & Drones Uncov­er 303 New Naz­ca Lines in Peru\nHow the “First Pho­to­jour­nal­ist,” Math­ew Brady, Shocked the Nation with Pho­tos from the Civ­il War\nDown­load 100,000+ Images From The His­to­ry of Med­i­cine, All Free Cour­tesy of The Well­come Library\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n            Over the last few days, my feed has filled up with galleries posting statements about standing in solidarity with protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Black text on white backgrounds. Thoughtful fonts. Promises to “hold space” and “support our communities.”As activists across the United States call for a nationwide strike against ICE today, the question facing cultural institutions is not whether to take sides rhetorically, but whether their material practices can withstand the moral pressure of the moment. I don’t doubt that many of the people writing these statements mean them. But in the art world, sincerity has a way of settling into style while the underlying terms of business remain untouched.We already have a name for one version of this pattern: performative allyship. In 2015 and 2016 it took the form of safety pins worn to signal safety and moral alignment. In 2020 it appeared as black squares posted in near unison across social media feeds. In each case, the gesture oriented itself toward being seen on the right side of history. Because its primary function was reputational, it was almost entirely frictionless. Nothing about how an institution actually operated, who it funded, or how it distributed power had to change.But not all frictionless allyship is cynical performance. Something can be heartfelt and well-intentioned and still leave the machinery perfectly smooth. A sincere caption. A beautifully designed solidarity graphic. A day off on an already quiet Friday when collectors are out of town. Meanwhile, the opening still happens, the 50% commission still applies, the art-fair invoices are paid, and artists still wait months to receive their money after a sale.All performative allyship is frictionless.Not all frictionless allyship is performative.The difference between those categories is intent. The difference that matters here is effect.Frictionless allyship is solidarity that requires no operational change. Real solidarity introduces drag. Something in the schedule, the budget, or the contract has to hesitate because the institution chose consequence over convenience.This idea of friction has deep roots in how protest makes injustice legible to people otherwise insulated from it.During the lunch counter sit-ins of the Civil Rights movement, students didn’t release statements about segregation. They sat at Whites-only counters and asked to be served. That act shut counters down, cost businesses money, and forced ordinary patrons to confront racial violence in the middle of their lunch break.The point wasn’t just to get a sandwich. It was to make the cost of injustice visible to those who benefited from not seeing it. Private harm became public inconvenience.Protests against ICE use the same grammar of interruption. Immigration enforcement is built to be administratively smooth and socially distant: a pre-dawn knock on the door, a parent taken from a workplace, a sudden transfer that makes a court date unreachable. By the time a family understands what has happened, their loved one may be hundreds of miles away in detention.Protest jams that quiet efficiency. Streets close. Traffic backs up. Daily routines detour around the fact that detention and deportation are not abstract policy, but lived rupture.Today, a nationwide strike known as \"ICE Out\" calls for “no work, no school, no shopping” in protest of recent fatal shootings and expanded federal immigration enforcement. Tens of thousands of people are participating in an economic blackout and mass demonstrations in Minnesota against ICE operations, with labor unions, community groups and local businesses closing in solidarity and pressuring for an end to ICE funding and accountability for federal agents’ actions. Restaurants, cafes and other businesses in cities including New York are closed or performing solidarity actions in support of the strike and protest, a form of collective action that involves real economic sacrifice rather than symbolic endorsement of a cause. Friction is communication, not chaos.In a consumer economy, friction can also look like refusal. Today, many Black Americans are deliberately creating that friction by refusing to spend money at Target. This is not random consumer drift but a collective decision to withdraw participation from a corporation whose image has long been burnished through cultural philanthropy.For years, Target sponsored free museum days that expanded access for families who might not otherwise afford admission. Those days mattered. But they also created a loop: Black consumer spending funded corporate philanthropy, philanthropy produced cultural legitimacy, and that legitimacy softened the corporation’s public image. Even after those programs disappeared before the pandemic, the reputational glow remained.The current refusal breaks that loop by turning absence into pressure. The disruption shows up not as a statement but as a number on a balance sheet.If the absence of Black dollars can register as leverage in a corporation’s ledger, then solidarity that never registers anywhere in a gallery’s ledger is not leverage at all.Keeping ICE at the center clarifies the stakes. This is opposition to a system that separates families and cages people in detention while relying on bureaucratic smoothness and public distance to keep that violence tolerable.If a gallery’s solidarity leaves its own openings, payment timelines, commission structures, and fair schedules exactly as before, then the solidarity is only visual. It borrows the language of disruption while protecting the conditions of comfort.Hundreds of commercial galleries posted statements ahead of today's general strike. (all screenshots via Instagram by Hyperallergic)You don’t need insider access to tell the difference. Ask a few blunt questions.Did this gesture cost the institution anything measurable?Did it move money, time, or decision-making power toward immigrant artists and communities most vulnerable to ICE’s violence?Will anything still be different after the news cycle passes and the next show opens?If deleting the post tomorrow would change nothing about how artists are paid, how commissions are split, or how resources are allocated, the allyship was frictionless, whether sincere or strategic.Friction requires observable, tangible change. That might mean paying artists on delivery rather than after collectors pay. Temporarily reducing the gallery’s commission and publicly committing to that timeline. Delaying or downsizing an art-fair booth in order to redirect those funds to immigrant legal defense. Creating emergency support for undocumented cultural workers. Hosting know-your-rights clinics in the gallery space.Not gestures that decorate the program, but decisions that reorient priorities toward people whose lives are already being interrupted.The art world is adept at metabolizing critique as aesthetics, hanging dissent on the wall while leaving the contract in the back office untouched. A solidarity post risks becoming another polished object in the feed, adjacent to installation shots and press clippings, carrying no more operational weight than an exhibition announcement.Performative allyship is about looking right.Frictionless allyship is about nothing having to move.Real solidarity is about choosing, on purpose, to let institutional comfort give way to human urgency.If institutions want to stand with people whose lives have been upended by detention and deportation, their solidarity has to show up as time, protection, and material support that outlasts the post and reaches the people who are actually at risk.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        ICE\n                      \n                      \n                        art galleries\n                      \n                      \n                        galleries\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n    \n                Book Review\n                A new translation of the French artist’s 1930 memoir is a kaleidoscopic collection of dialogues, sketches, and Blakean proverbs.\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n        \n            Claude Cahun, \"I am in training, don't kiss me\" (1927) (image public domain CC0 via Wikimedia Commons)In our present age of extractions and casual exterminations, when we seem forced to endure the rancid logics of the early 20th century anew, it feels improbable that a survival kit should reach us in the form of modernism itself. Yet the last several years have seen the translation, reissue, and recirculation of an audacious clutch of work by modernist writers and artists, from Gabriel Pomerand's buoyant Lettrism to Yi Sang's homophonic poetry, from Leonora Carrington's self-liberating oneirism to Joyce Mansour's reversed flight from margin to metropole.  Taken together, these works offer a counter-arsenal of dreams.The latest of these is Claude Cahun's Cancelled Confessions (Or Disavowals) (1930), translated by Susan de Muth and republished by Siglio Press in October. To give a single biographical sketch of Claude Cahun is to offend against this artist’s refusal to be just one thing. The name itself is an invention, as is that of Cahun's partner in life and art, Marcel Moore. These alliterative noms-de-guerre suggest identity is less a fixed quality than something that can be snipped apart and re-stitched. Both members of the Paris Surrealist orbit who moved to the British Isle of Jersey in 1937, Cahun and Moore's queer life-and-art-making included works of theater, costume, photography, text, domesticity, and even anti-Nazi sabotage. Theirs were many decades of refusal, disavowal, and glittering possibility.Spread from Cancelled Confessions (or Disavowals) by Claude Cahun (Siglio, 2025), translated by Susan de Muth (image courtesy Siglio, all rights reserved)Cancelled Confessions is itself a work of refusal — a refusal to produce the linear memoir Cahun was initially invited to write by publisher Adrienne Monnier, who ultimately turned down the manuscript and left it to be taken up by a more radical publisher in 1930. This refusal birthed a work of infinite invention. As scholar Amelia Groom attests in her new afterword, even Cahun's iconic \"self-portraits\" are not what they seem; Moore collaborated in photographing Cahun in various costumes, masks, and pantomimed poses, employing tricks of light, contrast, scale, cropping and angle. While the author credit for Cancelled Confessions goes to Cahun, Moore composed the dizzying photomontages that preface the book and each of its sections. These collages insert Cahun's already fictionalized image into a galaxy of doubles, miniatures, mirror-images, avatars, a giant eye which might be Cahun's own if we were operating in a world of singular possessives — which, thanks to both artists’ collaborative interventions, we are not. Cahun's text itself is also ravishingly myriad, split into nine sections that are themselves split into tributaries of declaration (\"I want to change skin: tear the old one from me\"), dialogues, sketches, Wildean paradoxes (\"Purity is composed of all the stains, just as white is of all the colors\"), Cocteauian fables, Blakean proverbs. The work is self-described “verbal debauchery\" and self-theorizing; \"We are only ever shown the hero's point of view. But what if I take a minor player's side?\" writes Cahun.Much credit must go to de Muth for the nimbleness of this translation. Stylistically, the writing is rambunctious with puns and made singular by its instinct to drive all syntaxes toward the plural. It's also stylish, sexy, and funny, a kind of handbook of what Cahun called \"angel slang.\" The figure of Narcissus provides Cahun with an emblem of the book's instinct for paradox, singular because he embraces his double, exemplary in his notoriety: \"That beautiful child was able to extract the infinite from his reflection, while we remain vibrations away, always the same, incapable of going any further.\" Amid the book's continuous brainstorm, synaptic and replete, de Muth deploys a neat aim and a sustaining sense of fun. Cancelled Confessions arrives in a deliciously designed oxblood-red codex; such attention to the book itself as the alchemical joining of writing and art is Siglio's hallmark. In my hands, this vital object opened almost of its own volition, so as to restore my own. To recognize that this book, like those of other newly republished modernists, exists thanks to the labor both of translators and editors at independent presses such as Siglio, World Poetry Book, Wave, New York Review Books, and City Lights, is to recognize that survival will be collaborative — or it shall not be at all.Cover of Cancelled Confessions (or Disavowals) (Siglio, 2025) (image courtesy Siglio)Cancelled Confessions (or Disavowals) (2025) by Claude Cahun, translated by Susan de Muth with a preface by Pierre Mac Orlan and essay by Amelia Groom, is published by Siglio Press and available online and through independent booksellers.\n                  \n                      \n                        Book Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Claude Cahun\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

He combined pieces of scrap paper, sometimes hoarded for decades, with soot bound by saliva to create formally gorgeous works that revel in the way ink ripples across the page, or cardboard can bend like a body. Dimensions presents 14 of these, among them grayscale drawings, color images, assemblages, and text pieces. \"Untitled (Time Magazine book)\" (1933–40), soot, spit, and string on paperCheck out the medium line for “Untitled (shooting stars)” (undated): “color of unknown origin on found paper.” It’s a tiny, unevenly thick piece of paper splotched by a light wash of blue and gray ink, suggesting to me the point where sea meets earth — this, from landlocked Idaho. Indeed, we talk often about the transportive power of art, but these feel literally, almost metaphysically, so — as if we’re entering a universe bound by a different set of rules that it’s a pleasure to explore. “Untitled (Door)” (undated), rendered on what looks like balloon-dotted wrapping paper, depicts a pair of disembodied doors, set against no edifice except for the picture plane itself. Meanwhile, “Untitled (Diptych)” (undated) uses that same paper as the backdrop of a peculiar, yin yang-like work in which robed figures stand at different distances behind a chain link fence. Who is that at the door? One of my favorite pieces in this exhibition is “Untitled (Time Magazine Book)” (1933–40). In it, Castle creates a postcard of sorts, complete with hand-drawn stamps — a testament to how far the imagination can travel. \"Untitled (Small Blondie)\" (undated), found paper, flour paste, soot\"Untitled (shooting stars)\" (undated), color of unknown origin on found paper\"Untitled (Door)\" (undated), soot and found paper\"Untitled (Diptych)\" (undated), soot, saliva on paperJames Castle: Dimensions continues at Rodder gallery (22 East 80th Street, Fifth Floor, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through February 14.

It was the eve of a massive winter snowstorm, and I was looking glumly out the window, which, in true New York fashion, faces only other apartments.Marciari brought me to a very different place: the luxurious, languid heat of late-summer Rome, in one of the final years of the 16th century. There, an ordinary boy has been made to hold a heavy basket of fruit for far longer than he’d like in a hot, airless studio, and a young, unknown painter is on the precipice of greatness. In our interview, Marciari fills me in on the life and influence of this — shall we say, colorful character; Rome’s burgeoning and surprisingly modern gallery system (think 1960s New York); and what it’s like to essentially live with a Caravaggio. No fair. —Lisa Yin Zhang, associate editor \nCaravaggio, \"Boy with a Basket of Fruit\" (c. 1593) (photo Lisa Yin Zhang/Hyperallergic)The Moment Caravaggio Became CaravaggioEven an Old Master was young once. A Morgan Library exhibition about Caravaggio’s “Boy with a Basket of Fruit” is a portrait of an artist as a young man — ambitious, talented, and maybe a little petty. “He’s not a perfect artist yet,” curator Marciari told me.

It makes you wonder: How would Miró feel about the US today?Not too good, I assume. In today's America, artists pay tribute to Alex Pretti, the ICU nurse slain by federal agents in Minneapolis. In Philadelphia, artist-made road signs warn of fascism ahead. Meanwhile, the country might lose its art market dominance due to Trump's brute immigration policies.

Was the culture minister merely incompetent and irrational? Scholar M. Neelika Jayawardane, who researches South African art and literature, thinks we're asking the wrong questions. She argues in an opinion today that this example, and the art piece by Gabrielle Goliath at its heart, reveals a broader framework of state censorship that artists are uniquely positioned to resist.A Closer Look Caravaggio, \"Boy with a Basket of Fruit\" (1595), oil on canvas (all photos Lisa Yin Zhang/Hyperallergic)The Moment Caravaggio Became CaravaggioEven an Old Master was young once.

    "body": "\n\tin Life, Music |   \tJanuary 14th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nImag­ine, if you will, tak­ing a seat at the piano before a full house of 2,000 music lovers ready to hear Mozart’s Piano Con­cer­to No. 20 in D minor — and, more impor­tant­ly, on stage with an orches­tra and con­duc­tor more than ready to play it. That would be dif­fi­cult enough, but now imag­ine that you thought you were sup­posed to play the Piano Con­cer­to No.23 in A major, anoth­er piece of music entire­ly. This is the stuff of night­mares, and indeed, the very sit­u­a­tion in which pianist Maria João Pires found her­self in 2013, after she’d been recruit­ed to fill in for anoth­er play­er at an open rehearsal held at Ams­ter­dam’s Con­cert­ge­bouw. You can watch it unfold, assum­ing you can bear it, in the clip above.\nAs Pires says in the Clas­sic FM inter­view below, it had been “per­haps 11 months” since she’d last played the piece into which she could hear the orches­tra launch­ing, “and that’s the moment where you start los­ing the mem­o­ry of the details. That’s how the mem­o­ry func­tions, you know. And when peo­ple see this pan­ic, they per­haps don’t know that the real­i­ty is, we lose our mem­o­ries after just a cou­ple of months.”\nIt seems to have been the encour­age­ment of con­duc­tor Ric­car­do Chail­ly that got her through the moment of pan­ic and into a cred­itable per­for­mance. “You know it so well!” he insist­ed to her, and indeed, as he remem­bered lat­er, “The mir­a­cle is that she has such a mem­o­ry that she could, with­in a minute, switch to a new con­cer­to with­out mak­ing one mis­take.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe eleventh-hour call Pires received ask­ing her to take the gig was part of the prob­lem, but so was a mis­heard num­ber. Accord­ing to the Köchel cat­a­logue, which orga­nizes all of Mozart’s work, the Piano Con­cer­to No. 20 in D minor is 466, where­as the Piano Con­cer­to No. 23 in A major is 488. Whether Pires mis­heard the K‑number or the caller mis­spoke, she soon found her­self faced with a musi­cal chal­lenge for which she felt com­plete­ly unpre­pared. In fact, she was­n’t: as Chail­ly knew, or at least banked on, her career as a clas­si­cal pianist up to that point had giv­en her all the expe­ri­ence she need­ed to draw upon to over­come the cri­sis. As her recov­ery reminds us, pro­fes­sion­al­ism isn’t so much about mak­ing sure that things always go right as being able to han­dle it when they go wrong. It hap­pens that Pires has gone through this par­tic­u­lar kind of mix-up three times, which makes her a con­sum­mate pro­fes­sion­al indeed.\nvia MyMod­ern­Met\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Kei­th Jar­rett Played on a Bro­ken Piano & Turned a Poten­tial­ly Dis­as­trous Con­cert Into the Best-Sell­ing Piano Album of All Time (1975)\nWatch the First Per­for­mance of a Mozart Com­po­si­tion That Had Been Lost for Cen­turies\nHear the Exper­i­men­tal Piano Jazz Album by Come­di­an H.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tJanuary 13th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHuman­i­ty was already enjoy­ing motion pic­tures a cen­tu­ry ago. But the abil­i­ty to do so at home still lay a few decades in the future, and the abil­i­ty to pull up a movie on demand through a stream­ing ser­vice much fur­ther still. Young peo­ple in the twen­ty-twen­ties may be unable to fath­om how pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions got by with­out Net­flix and the like, but all of us, what­ev­er our age, may be curi­ous about what such plat­forms would have offered in the nine­teen-twen­ties. Now we can see for our­selves on Wik­i­Flix, a free stream­ing site that offers more than 4,000 pub­lic-domain films for our enjoy­ment. Cur­rent­ly hot on its front page: Fritz Lang’s Metrop­o­lis, Sergei Eisen­stein’s Bat­tle­ship Potemkin, and F. W. Mur­nau’s Nos­fer­atu.\n\n\n\t\n\nEven casu­al film-lovers will know those impor­tant titles, even if they have yet to watch the pic­tures them­selves. Reg­u­lar Open Cul­ture read­ers may also spot more than a few movies pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here: Georges Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon; Lotte Reiniger’s The Adven­tures of Prince Achmed; William Cameron Men­zies’ (H. G. Wells-script­ed) Things to Come; Ida Lupino’s The Hitch-Hik­er.\nThere’s also Stan­ley Donen’s Cha­rade, the best film Alfred Hitch­cock nev­er made — as well as some of the films he did make, like The Lodger, Jamaica Inn, and Noto­ri­ous. Hitch­cock­’s Mur­der! was one of the works from 1930 that just came avail­able on Pub­lic Domain Day at the begin­ning of this month, along with the likes of the Marx Broth­ers-star­ring Ani­mal Crack­ers and the Best Pic­ture-win­ning All Qui­et on the West­ern Front.\n\n\n\t\n\nNot all the movies on Wik­i­Flix are at least 95 years old. Some have fall­en into the pub­lic domain for rea­sons oth­er than sheer age. Oth­ers, like Nina Paley’s Sita Sings the Blues, were made freely avail­able by their cre­ators upon release; browse the site by year, and you can find plen­ty of oth­er recent pro­duc­tions. On the list of sec­tions, you can also orga­nize your view­ing options by coun­try, fre­quen­cy of cita­tion on Wikipedia (whose vol­un­teer com­mu­ni­ty cre­at­ed Wik­i­Flix), or genre. How about a film noir tonight? A bud­dy pic­ture? Some form of exploita­tion? Per­haps a B west­ern? As TechCrunch’s Aman­da Sil­ber­ling writes, “Why not watch a Sovi­et musi­cal inspired by Cin­derel­la, a silent film about swash­buck­ling pirates, or a Japan­ese post-apoc­a­lyp­tic film that fea­tures a guy who some­how played for both the Boston Celtics and the Chica­go Cubs?” With It’s a Won­der­ful Life on there, you at least know you’re set for next Christ­mas.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\n4,000+ Free Movies Online: Great Clas­sics, Indies, Noir, West­erns, Doc­u­men­taries & More\nDown­load 9,200+ Free Films from the Prelinger Archives: Doc­u­men­taries, Car­toons & More\nWatch 3,000+ Films Free Online from the Nation­al Film Board of Cana­da\n60 Free Film Noir Movies You Can Watch Online, Includ­ing Clas­sics by John Hus­ton, Orson Welles & Fritz Lang\nWatch 70+ Clas­sic Lit­er­ary Films Free Online: The Snows of Kil­i­man­jaro, Gulliver’s Trav­els, Jane Eyre, and More\nWhat’s Enter­ing the Pub­lic Domain in 2026: Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, All Qui­et on the West­ern Front, Bet­ty Boop & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nOne poten­tial draw­back of genius, it seems, is rest­less­ness, a mind per­pet­u­al­ly on the move. Of course, this is what makes many cel­e­brat­ed thinkers and artists so pro­duc­tive. That and the extra hours some gain by sac­ri­fic­ing sleep. Voltaire report­ed­ly drank up to 50 cups of cof­fee a day, and seems to have suf­fered no par­tic­u­lar­ly ill effects. Balzac did the same, and died at 51. The caf­feine may have had some­thing to do with it. Both Socrates and Samuel John­son believed that sleep is wast­ed time, and “so for years has thought grey-haired Richard Buck­min­ster Fuller,” wrote Time mag­a­zine in 1943, “futu­rif­ic inven­tor of the Dymax­ion house, the Dymax­ion car and the Dymax­ion globe.”\nEngi­neer and vision­ary Fuller intend­ed his “Dymax­ion” brand to rev­o­lu­tion­ize every aspect of human life, or—in the now-slight­ly-dat­ed par­lance of our obses­sion with all things hacking—he engi­neered a series of rad­i­cal “life­hacks.” Giv­en his views on sleep, that seem­ing­ly essen­tial activ­i­ty also received a Dymax­ion upgrade, the trade­marked name com­bin­ing “dynam­ic,” “max­i­mum,” and “ten­sion.” “Two hours of sleep a day,” Fuller announced, “is plen­ty.” Did he con­sult with spe­cial­ists? Med­ical doc­tors? Biol­o­gists? Noth­ing as dull as that. He did what many a mad sci­en­tist does in the movies. (In the search, as Vin­cent Price says at the end of The Fly, “for the truth.”) He cooked up a the­o­ry, and test­ed it on him­self.\n“Fuller,” Time report­ed, “rea­soned that man has a pri­ma­ry store of ener­gy, quick­ly replen­ished, and a sec­ondary reserve (sec­ond wind) that takes longer to restore.” He hypoth­e­sized that we would need less sleep if we stopped to take a nap at “the first sign of fatigue.” Fuller trained him­self to do just that, for­go­ing the typ­i­cal eight hours, more or less, most of us get per night. He found—as have many artists and researchers over the years—that “after a half-hour nap he was com­plete­ly refreshed.” Naps every six hours allowed him to shrink his total sleep per 24-hour peri­od to two hours. Did he, like the 50s mad sci­en­tist, become a trag­ic vic­tim of his own exper­i­ment?\nNo dan­ger of merg­ing him with a fly or turn­ing him invis­i­ble. The exper­i­men­t’s fail­ure may have meant a day in bed catch­ing up on lost sleep. Instead, Fuller kept it up for two full years, 1932 and 1933, and report­ed feel­ing in “the most vig­or­ous and alert con­di­tion that I have ever enjoyed.” He might have slept two hours a day in 30 minute incre­ments indef­i­nite­ly, Time sug­gests, but found that his “busi­ness asso­ciates… insist­ed on sleep­ing like oth­er men,” and wouldn’t adapt to his eccen­tric sched­ule, though some not for lack of try­ing. In his book Buck­y­Works J. Bald­win claims, “I can per­son­al­ly attest that many of his younger col­leagues and stu­dents could not keep up with him. He nev­er seemed to tire.”\nA research orga­ni­za­tion looked into the sleep sys­tem and “not­ed that not every­one was able to train them­selves to sleep on com­mand.” The point may seem obvi­ous to the sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of peo­ple who suf­fer from insom­nia. “Bucky dis­con­cert­ed observers,” Bald­win writes, “by going to sleep in thir­ty sec­onds, as if he had thrown an Off switch in his head. It hap­pened so quick­ly that it looked like he had had a seizure.” Buck­min­ster Fuller was undoubt­ed­ly an unusu­al human, but human all the same. Time report­ed that “most sleep inves­ti­ga­tors agree that the first hours of sleep are the sound­est.” A Col­gate Uni­ver­si­ty researcher at the time dis­cov­ered that “peo­ple awak­ened after four hours’ sleep were just as alert, well-coor­di­nat­ed phys­i­cal­ly and resis­tant to fatigue” as those who slept the full eight.\nSleep research since the for­ties has made a num­ber of oth­er find­ings about vari­able sleep sched­ules among humans, study­ing shift work­ers’ sleep and the so-called “bipha­sic” pat­tern com­mon in cul­tures with very late bed­times and sies­tas in the mid­dle of the day. The suc­cess of this sleep rhythm “con­tra­dicts the nor­mal idea of a monopha­sic sleep­ing sched­ule,” writes Evan Mur­ray at MIT’s Cul­ture Shock, “in which all our time asleep is lumped into one block.” Bipha­sic sleep results in six or sev­en hours of sleep rather than the sev­en to nine of monopha­sic sleep­ers. Polypha­sic sleep­ing, how­ev­er, the kind pio­neered by Fuller, seems to gen­uine­ly result in even less need­ed sleep for many. It’s an idea that’s only become wide­spread “with­in rough­ly the last decade,” Mur­ray not­ed in 2009. He points to the redis­cov­ery, with­out any clear indebt­ed­ness, of Fuller’s Dymax­ion sys­tem by col­lege stu­dent Maria Staver, who named her method “Uber­man,” in hon­or of Niet­zsche, and spread its pop­u­lar­i­ty through a blog and a book.\nMur­ray also reports on anoth­er blog­ger, Steve Pavli­na, who con­duct­ed the exper­i­ment on him­self and found that “over a peri­od of 5 1/2 months, he was suc­cess­ful in adapt­ing com­plete­ly,” reap­ing the ben­e­fits of increased pro­duc­tiv­i­ty. But like Fuller, Pavli­na gave it up, not for “health rea­sons,” but because, he wrote, “the rest of the world is monopha­sic” or close to it. Our long block of sleep appar­ent­ly con­tains a good deal of “wast­ed tran­si­tion time” before we arrive at the nec­es­sary REM state. Polypha­sic sleep trains our brains to get to REM more quick­ly and effi­cient­ly. For this rea­son, writes Mur­ray, “I believe it can work for every­one.” Per­haps it can, pro­vid­ed they are will­ing to bear the social cost of being out of sync with the rest of the world. But peo­ple like­ly to prac­tice Dymax­ion Sleep for sev­er­al months or years prob­a­bly already are.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Pow­er of Pow­er Naps: Sal­vador Dali Teach­es You How Micro-Naps Can Give You Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\nPeo­ple in the Mid­dle Ages Slept Not Once But Twice Each Night: How This Lost Prac­tice Was Redis­cov­ered\nBertrand Rus­sell & Buck­min­ster Fuller on Why We Should Work Less, and Live & Learn More\nEvery­thing I Know: 42 Hours of Buck­min­ster Fuller’s Vision­ary Lec­tures Free Online (1975)\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn museums everywhere, collections departments are troves of historical objects, art, cultural artifacts, and scientific specimens. In our increasingly digital age, it’s easy to forget that in many cases, a good amount—sometimes even the majority—of records are documented in heavy, physical catalogues or accession registers. And over the course of decades or even centuries, labels can get damaged, items can go awol, or in the worst case scenario, fire or water damage can destroy these valuable resources.\nIn a sense, these analog databases are just as important as the objects they document, providing information about provenance and materials. In filing drawers, cases, and archival boxes, pieces are labeled one way or another. Archaeological potsherds, for example, may be labeled right on the piece with varnish and ink. At Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, tiny invertebrates are preserved alongside ornate, handwritten labels that harken back to our not-so-distant pre-digital age.\n\nOne problem with the old system of analog record-keeping is that access is limited, and only those most intimately acquainted with a particular collection may know that something is there at all. Finding items often requires some old fashioned sleuthing. But thanks to growing online resources, museums are increasingly working to make their holdings more accessible to both researchers and the public.\nA new exhibition, Making the Invisible Visible: Digitizing Invertebrates on Microscope Slides, highlights Harvard’s diverse collection comprising more than 50,000 examples. Many are well over 100 years old, including a slide containing a soft coral specimen inscribed with, “sent to James Dwight Dana by Charles Darwin.” Some include whole insects, while others feature only wings or antennae.\nThe exhibition marks an extension of an ambitious project launched in 2024 to bring the collection into the 21st century by digitizing more than 3,000 specimens. This includes locating, restoring, rehousing, and capturing high-resolution images so that the collection can be published online for use by researchers around the world. Indeed, even the addition of QR code labels to the 19th-century objects is a thought-provoking juxtaposition of historical and contemporary archiving techniques. How will scientists use these another century from now?\nMaking the Invisible Visible is now on view at the Harvard Museum of Natural History in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom figures with multiple legs and noodles for arms to frolicking trees, Paco Pomet summons the absurd. Known for his uncanny oil paintings rendered mostly in monochrome and enlivened by colorful details of overly stretchy limbs or celestial objects, a sense of nostalgia greets surreal scenarios. The artist often derives his imagery from vintage black-and-white photographs, adding an absurd dimension to history.\nPomet’s work is currently on view in a solo exhibition titled Planet Circus at Richard Heller Gallery, which continues through February 14 in Santa Monica.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn her uncanny visages and sculptures, Malene Hartmann Rasmussen taps the ceramic medium as a form of make-believe. Surreal folkloric creatures take on absurd, sometimes cartoonish personalities, assembled from disparate plants and critters or reflecting characterful, mask-like qualities.\nIn Rasmussen’s playfully monstrous “Egg-head,” for example, silly antics are equally unsettling—what’s in its mouth? Where is the rest of its body? And “Inner Beast #10” gives a disgusted side-eye that’s open to interpretation. What does it find so offensive?\n“Egg-head” (2025), glazed stoneware, 24-carat gold luster, 37 x 27 x 21 centimeters\nBy disturbing the boundaries between cuteness and abjection and the playful and unsettling, the artist invokes the power of imagination and the enigmatic atmosphere of fairytales. Her ongoing Trolls series combines natural objects like snail shells, eggs, leaves, and flowers into sage mysterious faces that give little indication of whether they’re well-meaning or not.\nStarting tomorrow, find these works alongside paintings James Mortimer in the exhibition Brutes at James Freeman Gallery, which continues through February 14 in London.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe inner crit­ic cre­ates writer’s block and sti­fles adven­tur­ous writ­ing, hems it in with safe clichés and over­think­ing. Every writer has to find his or her own way to get free of that sour­puss ratio­nal­ist who insists on stran­gling each thought with log­i­cal analy­sis and fit­ting each idea into an oppres­sive pre­de­ter­mined scheme or ide­ol­o­gy. William S. Bur­roughs, one of the most adven­tur­ous writ­ers to emerge from the mid-20th cen­tu­ry, famous­ly employed what he called the cut-up method.\nDevel­oped by Bur­roughs and painter Brion Gysin, this lit­er­ary take on the col­lage tech­nique used by avant-garde artists like Georges Braque orig­i­nat­ed with Sur­re­al­ist Tris­tan Tzara, who “pro­posed to cre­ate a poem on the spot by pulling words out of a hat.” The sug­ges­tion was so provoca­tive, Bur­roughs claims in his essay “The Cut-Up Method,” that cut-ups were there­after “ground­ed… on the Freudi­an couch.”\nSince Bur­roughs and Gysin’s lit­er­ary rede­ploy­ment of the method in 1959, it has proved use­ful not only for poets and nov­el­ists, but for song­writ­ers like David Bowie and Kurt Cobain. And any frus­trat­ed nov­el­ist, poet, or song­writer may use it to shake off the habit­u­al thought pat­terns that cage cre­ativ­i­ty or choke it off entire­ly. How so?\nWell, it’s best at this point to defer to the author­i­ty, Bur­roughs him­self, who explains the cut-up tech­nique thus:\nThe method is sim­ple. Here is one way to do it. Take a page. Like this page. Now cut down the mid­dle and cross the mid­dle. You have four sec­tions: 1 2 3 4 … one two three four. Now rearrange the sec­tions plac­ing sec­tion four with sec­tion one and sec­tion two with sec­tion three. And you have a new page. Some­times it says much the same thing. Some­times some­thing quite different–(cutting up polit­i­cal speech­es is an inter­est­ing exercise)–in any case you will find that it says some­thing and some­thing quite def­i­nite. Take any poet or writer you fan­cy. Here­say, or poems you have read over many times. The words have lost mean­ing and life through years of rep­e­ti­tion. Now take the poem and type out select­ed pas­sages. Fill a page with excerpts. Now cut the page. You have a new poem. As many poems as you like.\nBur­roughs gives us “one way” to do it. There may be infi­nite oth­ers, and it’s up to you to find what works. I myself have pushed through a cre­ative funk by mak­ing mon­tages from scraps of ancient poet­ry and phras­es of mod­ern pop, clichés ripped from the head­lines and eso­teric quotes from obscure reli­gious texts—pieced togeth­er more or less at ran­dom, then edit­ed to fit the form of a song, poem, or what­ev­er. Vir­tu­al cut-and-paste makes scis­sors unnec­es­sary, but the phys­i­cal act may pre­cip­i­tate epipha­nies. “Images shift sense under the scis­sors,” Bur­roughs writes; then he hints at a synes­the­sia expe­ri­ence: “smell images to sound sight to sound sound to kines­thet­ic.”\nWho is this method for? Every­one, Bur­roughs asserts. “Cuts ups are for every­one,” just as Tzara remarked that “poet­ry is for every­one.” No need to have estab­lished some exper­i­men­tal art world bona fides, or even call one­self an artist at all; the method is “exper­i­men­tal in the sense of being some­thing to do.” In the short video at the top, you can hear Bur­roughs explain the tech­nique fur­ther, adding his occult spin on things by not­ing that many cut-ups “seem to refer to future events.” On that account, we may sus­pend belief.\nAs Jen­nie Skerl notes in her essay on Bur­roughs, cut-up the­o­ry “par­al­lels avant-garde lit­er­ary the­o­ry” like Jacques Derrida’s Decon­struc­tion. “All writ­ing is in fact cut ups,” writes Bur­roughs, mean­ing not that all writ­ing is pieced togeth­er with scis­sors and glue, but that it’s all “a col­lage of words read heard over­heard.” This the­o­ry should lib­er­ate us from oner­ous notions of orig­i­nal­i­ty and authen­tic­i­ty, tied to ideas of the author as a sui gener­is, all-know­ing god and the text as an expres­sion of cos­mi­cal­ly ordered mean­ing. (Anoth­er sur­re­al­ist writ­ing method, the game of Exquis­ite Corpse, makes the point lit­er­al.) All that meta­phys­i­cal bag­gage weighs us down. Every­thing’s been done—both well and badly—before, Bur­roughs writes. Fol­low his meth­ods and his insis­tent cre­ative max­im and you can­not make a mistake—“Assume that the worst has hap­pened,” he writes, “and act accord­ing­ly.”\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow David Bowie, Kurt Cobain & Thom Yorke Write Songs With William Bur­roughs’ Cut-Up Tech­nique\nThe “Priest” They Called Him: A Dark Col­lab­o­ra­tion Between Kurt Cobain & William S.

    "body": "\n\tin Books, Music |   \tDecember 30th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you’re a reg­u­lar lis­ten­er, you know that Ezra Klein wraps up his pod­cast inter­views with a famil­iar ques­tion: what three books would you rec­om­mend to the audi­ence? When Klein inter­viewed Bri­an Eno in Octo­ber, the pro­duc­er had these three books to offer.\nFirst up was Print­ing and the Mind of Man, a cat­a­log from an exhi­bi­tion held at the British Muse­um in 1963. “It was about the his­to­ry of print­ing, but actu­al­ly, the book is about the most impor­tant books in the West­ern canon and the impact that they had when they were released.” “It’s such a fas­ci­nat­ing book because you real­ly start to under­stand where the big, fun­da­men­tal ideas that made West­ern cul­ture came from.”\nNext came A Pat­tern Lan­guage by the archi­tect Christo­pher Alexan­der. “It’s real­ly a book about habi­tat, about what makes spaces wel­com­ing and fruit­ful, or hos­tile and bar­ren.” Eno has returned to the book again and again over the years. “Over the course of my life, I’ve bought, I would say, 60 copies of that book because I always give it to any­one who is about to ren­o­vate a house or about to build a house. It’s a great read, and you would love it.”\nHis third rec­om­men­da­tion was Naples ’44, a war diary kept by Nor­man Lewis, a British intel­li­gence offi­cer sent to Naples dur­ing World War II. “He kept a diary, and this is the most fab­u­lous diary you’ll ever read. It’s just hilar­i­ous­ly fun­ny, deeply mov­ing, and total­ly confusing—and you real­ize that Naples was, like, anoth­er plan­et.”\nUnder­stand­ably, Klein couldn’t let the inter­view end with­out also ask­ing what albums influ­enced Eno most. In response, Eno offered The Rur­al Blues, a series of record­ings of Black Amer­i­can music from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. It’s the same music that lat­er inspired pop and rock musi­cians in Eng­land when Eno came of age. He also point­ed to the Vel­vet Underground’s self-titled third album, call­ing it a “beau­ti­ful, beau­ti­ful record, beau­ti­ful­ly con­tro­ver­sial in many ways.” He then added: “In fact, prob­a­bly with­out that record, I wouldn’t have been a pop musi­cian.” Many oth­er musi­cians have said the same.\nAnd final­ly, despite being an athe­ist, Eno select­ed a gospel record­ing act known as The Con­sol­ers, best known for their 1955 track “Give Me My Flow­ers.” You can lis­ten to more of their great­est hits here.\nAlong­side his musi­cal and lit­er­ary influ­ences, Eno recent­ly shared his own ideas in the book What Art Does: An Unfin­ished The­o­ry.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nBri­an Eno on the Loss of Human­i­ty in Mod­ern Music\nA 6‑Hour Time-Stretched Ver­sion of Bri­an Eno’s Music For Air­ports: Med­i­tate, Relax, Study\nBri­an Eno Cre­ates a List of 20 Books That Could Rebuild Civ­i­liza­tion\nJump Start Your Cre­ative Process with Bri­an Eno’s “Oblique Strate­gies” Deck of Cards (1975)\nBri­an Eno Lists the Ben­e­fits of Singing: A Long Life, Increased Intel­li­gence, and a Sound Civ­i­liza­tion\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Books, Literature |   \tDecember 30th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nOne can eas­i­ly imag­ine a read­er enjoy­ing both The Lord of the Rings and Dune. Both of those works of epic fan­ta­sy were pub­lished in the form of a series of long nov­els begin­ning in the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry; both cre­ate elab­o­rate worlds of their own, right down to details of ecol­o­gy and lan­guage; both seri­ous­ly (and these days, unfash­ion­ably) con­cern them­selves with the theme of what con­sti­tutes hero­ic action; both have even inspired mul­ti­ple big-bud­get Hol­ly­wood spec­ta­cles. The read­er equal­ly ded­i­cat­ed to the work of J. R. R. Tolkien and Frank Her­bert turns out to be a more elu­sive crea­ture than we may expect, but per­haps that should­n’t sur­prise us, giv­en Tolkien’s own atti­tude toward Dune.\n“It is impos­si­ble for an author still writ­ing to be fair to anoth­er author work­ing along the same lines,” Tolkien wrote in 1966 to a fan who’d sent him a copy of Her­bert’s book, which had come out the year before. “In fact I dis­like DUNE with some inten­si­ty, and in that unfor­tu­nate case it is much the best and fairest to anoth­er author to keep silent and refuse to com­ment.”\nThat lack of elab­o­ra­tion has, if any­thing, only stoked the curios­i­ty of Lord of the Rings and Dune enthu­si­asts alike, as evi­denced by this thread from a few years ago on the r/tolkienfans sub­red­dit. Was it the mate­ri­al­ism and Machi­avel­lian­ism implic­it in Dune’s world­view? The pre­pon­der­ance of invent­ed names and coinages that sure­ly would­n’t meet the ety­mo­log­i­cal stan­dard of an Oxford lin­guist?\nMaybe it was the aris­to­crat­ic iso­la­tion — a kind of anti-fel­low­ship — of its pro­tag­o­nist Paul Atrei­des, who comes to pos­sess the equiv­a­lent of Tolkien’s Ring of Pow­er. “In Dune, Paul will­ing­ly takes the (metaphor­i­cal) ring and wields it,” writes Evan Ama­to at The Cul­tur­ist. “He leads, trans­forms, and con­quers. The uni­verse bends to his vision. He suf­fers for it, yes, and ques­tions it, but he nev­er tru­ly rejects the call to rule. Con­trast this with the world of Mid­dle-earth, where all Tolkien’s heroes do the oppo­site. When Fro­do offers the Ring to Aragorn, he refus­es. Even Sam­wise, hum­ble as he is, feels the surge of the Ring’s pow­er, and lets it go.” Assum­ing he man­aged to get through the first Dune nov­el, Tolkien could hard­ly have approved of the nar­ra­tive’s moral arc. Whether his or Her­bert’s vision puts up the more real­is­tic alle­go­ry for human­i­ty’s lot is anoth­er mat­ter entire­ly.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nJ. R. R.

    "body": "\n\tin English Language, History, Language |   \tDecember 29th, 2025  27 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt’s easy to imag­ine the myr­i­ad dif­fi­cul­ties with which you’d be faced if you were sud­den­ly trans­port­ed a mil­len­ni­um back in time. But if you’re a native (or even pro­fi­cient) Eng­lish speak­er in an Eng­lish-speak­ing part of the world, the lan­guage, at least, sure­ly would­n’t be a prob­lem. Or so you’d think, until your first encounter with utter­ances like “þat troe is daed on gaerde” or “þa rokes for­leten urne tun.” Both of those sen­tences appear in the new video above from Simon Rop­er, in which he deliv­ers a mono­logue begin­ning in the Eng­lish of the fifth cen­tu­ry and end­ing in the Eng­lish of the end of the last mil­len­ni­um.\nAn Eng­lish­man spe­cial­iz­ing in videos about lin­guis­tics and anthro­pol­o­gy, Rop­er has pulled off this sort of feat before: we pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured him here on Open Cul­ture for his per­for­mance of a Lon­don accent as it evolved through 660 years.\nBut writ­ing and deliv­er­ing a mono­logue that works its way through a mil­len­ni­um and a half of change in the Eng­lish lan­guage is obvi­ous­ly a thornier endeav­or, not least because it involves lit­er­al thorns — the þ char­ac­ters, that is, used in the Old Eng­lish Latin alpha­bet. They’re pro­nounced like th, which you can hear when Rop­er speaks the sen­tences quot­ed ear­li­er, which trans­late to “The tree is dead in the yard” and “The rooks aban­doned our town.”\nThe word trans­late should give us pause, since we’re only talk­ing about Eng­lish. But then, Eng­lish has under­gone such a dra­mat­ic evo­lu­tion that, at far enough of a remove, we might as well be talk­ing about dif­fer­ent lan­guages. What Rop­er empha­sizes is that the changes did­n’t hap­pen sud­den­ly. Non-Scan­di­na­vian lis­ten­ers may lack even an inkling that his farmer of the year 450 is talk­ing about sheep and pigs with the words skēpu and swīnu, but his final lines, in which he speaks of pos­sess­ing “all the hot cof­fee I need” and “friends I did­n’t have in New York” in the year 2000, will pose no dif­fi­cul­ty to Anglo­phones any­where in the world. Even his list of agri­cul­tur­al wealth around the ear­ly thir­teenth cen­tu­ry — “We habben an god hus, we habben mani felds” — could make you believe that a trip 600 years in the past would be, as they said in Mid­dle Eng­lish, no trou­ble.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nTrac­ing Eng­lish Back to Its Old­est Known Ances­tor: An Intro­duc­tion to Pro­to-Indo-Euro­pean\nHear the Evo­lu­tion of the Lon­don Accent Over 660 Years: From 1346 to 2006\nWhat Shakespeare’s Eng­lish Sound­ed Like, and How We Know It\nWhere Did the Eng­lish Lan­guage Come From?: An Ani­mat­ed Intro­duc­tion\nA Brief Tour of British & Irish Accents: 14 Ways to Speak Eng­lish in 84 Sec­onds\nThe Entire His­to­ry of Eng­lish in 22 Min­utes\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAs we reflect on 2025, we’re taking a peek into our archive to spotlight some of the stories we’re still thinking about. It’s a joy and a privilege to share so much creativity with you each day, and we’re grateful to know you’re out there reading. \nIn case you missed it, check out our favorite art books of the year. \n—Christopher, Grace, Kate, and Jackie\n“Bosch Beast No. 14” (2025), paper, paperboard, glue, wire, and crepe paper, 33 × 19 × 14 inches\nUncanny Papier-Mâché Creatures by Roberto Benavidez Mingle in ‘Bosch Beasts’\nFor Los Angeles-based artist Roberto Benavidez, the art of the piñata is a central tenet of a practice exploring intersecting themes of race, sexuality, humor, sin, and beauty. He draws upon the paper art form’s early religious significance in Mexico, when Spanish missionaries used a seven-pointed version as a tool for converting Indigenous people to Christianity. This motif, which appears in some of Benavidez’s distinctive sculptures, nods to its past colonial use.\n© Marcel Heijnen\nMarcel Heijnen Captures Loving Portraits of Feisty, Feral Felines in ‘City Cats of Istanbul’\nIn some parts of the world, stray animals are nearly as beloved as pets. Thousands of dogs roam the streets of Cusco, Peru, for example, and cats pretty much rule the night in places like Athens, Valletta, and Japan’s “cat islands.” Residents often feed and provide shelter for these roving colonies, and for Dutch photographer Marcel Heijnen, this human-animal connection provides endless opportunities to experience urban centers.\nFrom a performance by the Bavarian Junior Ballet\nEnjoy the Brilliant Ballet that Brought Dance to the Bauhaus Movement\nGiven the emphasis on functionality and design for industrial production, the Bauhaus movement is rarely associated with disciplines like dance. But for Oskar Schlemmer (1888-1943), translating its principles into movement and performance was as compelling as a well-conceived chair or building.\nBasket stars, a type of echinoderm, are abundant on seamounts and rocky outcroppings\nAmong Newly Discovered Ocean Species, a Baby Colossal Squid Is Filmed for the First Time\nAn archipelago in the South Atlantic known as the South Sandwich Islands is home to some of the most remote landmasses in the world. Uninhabited except for occasional scientific research, their volcanic makeup highlights the geological and ecological diversity of this part of the world, and we still have much to learn. In 2025, Schmidt Ocean Institute completed a 35-day trek on the Falkor (too) to the remote island chain and discovered new hydrothermal vents, coral gardens, and what researchers suspect to be entirely new species. During this expedition, the team also confirmed the sighting of a juvenile colossal squid, capturing one on film for the first time.\nFrance Leclerc, “Head Ball”\nBlink and You’d Miss the Moments Topping This Year’s Pure Street Photography Awards\nCoincidence is around every corner, and immortalizing a split second of fleeting chaos takes a special eye.

From here, she captured thousands of incredible photographs throughout her lifetime. In 2025, the entire archive of Austen’s photos returned to Clear Comfort after being held by a local historical society, thanks to a landmark acquisition.\nStephanie H. Shih, “Nuclear Family” (2024).

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis past summer, Participant Inc., a Lower East Side art nonprofit, hosted an exhibition on Chloe Dzubilo, a trans woman who became an AIDS activist after contracting the disease. The show, curated by Alex Fleming and Nia Nottage, was immensely rich and important for both its historical and personal insights into the artist’s life. Through text-based works and drawings, the artist painted an intimate and sometimes painful picture of her experience living in subsidized housing for people with AIDS and discrimination at the hands of medical professionals. I reviewed the show with the hope that it would strike a nerve with readers from all walks of life who have experienced subpar healthcare, housing instability, and personal strife.It was one of a handful of New York shows this year that centered art by or about trans and gender-nonconforming people. At a moment when basic freedoms and legal protections for people who fall under the trans umbrella — even the right to be recognized — are being stripped away by the Trump administration, it’s encouraging to see some art institutions platforming artists such as Dzubilo. The art world’s support of work by or about trans and gender-nonconforming people seems to fly under the radar more than its support of many other marginalized groups. Last fall, I was able to sit in on a private conversation between two prominent artists I admire. Both identify as nonbinary and they discussed how, even in liberal circles, gender identity is often dismissed as a non-issue. Listening to them, I realized how true this often is in art and culture more broadly. I’m privileged to be in a position to help change this. This year I was grateful to raise the profile of some trans and nonbinary artists in my role as an editor and writer, and maybe to prompt some of the myriad conversations that can come out of their art.  The experiences that most stood out to me as an art critic and editor this year were those that brought attention to some of these exhibitions. In addition to my review of Dzubilo’s show, I was able to cover another historically significant show, Dueñas de la Noche: Trans Lives and Dreams in 1980s Caracas at the Institute for Studies on Latin American Art. Alexis Clements wrote about The Met’s Casa Susanna, while Emma Cieslik covered Spectrum of Desire: Love, Sex, and Gender in the Middle Ages at The Met Cloisters. Another great read is my colleague Lisa Yin Zhang’s review of Nayland Blake’s work at Matthew Marks Gallery. Through their writings, visual art, and performance, Blake has been a guiding light to LGBTQ+ artists (and others) for decades. Vaginal Davis, a pioneering LGBTQ+ artist whose work ranging from sculpture to punk music was the subject of a major survey at MoMA PS1, was covered here by Daniel Larkin.John Yau’s review of nonbinary artist Xingzi Gu’s paintings of androgynous figures illuminated the process and concepts behind the ethereal artworks. More pointed in their statements about identity but just as dreamlike was Hortensia Mi Kafchin’s recent show at PPOW Gallery, reviewed here by Cat Dawson, and Young Joon Kwak’s sparkling sculptures at the Leslie-Lohman Museum, reviewed by AX Mina.One of the year’s highlights was Tate Modern’s thorough and thoroughly compelling retrospective of Leigh Bowery, reviewed by Olivia McEwan. Bowery identified as a gay man, but his performances and handmade costumes, created amid 1980s London’s dazzling art underground, push gender-bending to new heights of complexity.Our writers covered plenty of other great shows this year, too: Aruna D’Souza’s incisive assessment of Duane Linklater at Dia Chelsea, Lori Waxman’s empathetic discussion of Chicago’s Red Line Service, a nonprofit that assists unhoused people, Carolina A. Miranda’s report on Chile’s 1980s punk underground, and Claudia Ross’s review of Burn Me at The Box in Los Angeles, which featured art and artists impacted by LA’s January fires. And I can’t sign off for the year without mentioning an exhibition that blew me away: Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg’s Only for the Wicked at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery was gorgeous and devastating.On a different note, make sure to read Senior Editor Valentina Di Liscia’s list of artworks that spoke truth to power in 2025.

    "body": "\n            I must confess something: I’m a grinch. The holiday season makes me morose. I dislike the pressures of gift-buying and the ever-present din of Christmas music, and I find red and green to be a regrettable color combination. But I adore the New Year. Like a true Aries, I live for fresh starts and new beginnings. Growing up, back-to-school shopping was my jam. Is there anything quite as hope-inducing as an unmarked notebook or a perfectly plump pink eraser? Also in classic Aries fashion, I’m fueled by new challenges, adventure, and the excitement of the uncharted — all of which are in generous supply here at Hyperallergic, where there’s never a dull moment. Yes, 2025 was filled with pain. The people with the least continued to suffer the most. But the stories I’m proud to have worked on this year were fierce and fearless in their commitment to justice and to uplifting the voices the mainstream art media ignores. Today, in the spirit of what lies ahead, I want to look back at the work that propelled me forward. Staff Writer Isa Farfan’s entirely unique, moving piece on figure-drawing models and their fight for recognition is the kind of story that’s at the heart of Hyperallergic: a deep dive into a community integral to our industry, yet chronically overlooked. Farfan also interviewed artist recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), broke the news of a show axed in the wake of President Trump's DEI ban, and reported tirelessly on this administration’s relentless attacks on culture. Staff Writer Rhea Nayyar’s on-the-ground report from Thomas J. Price’s new Times Square sculpture on a rainy Manhattan afternoon proved that the in-person experience of public art is worlds away from the malaise of online discourse. Nayyar investigated the fraught ethics of art in jails, examined how tariffs affect the cost of art supplies, wrote about a documentary on Columbia University’s student encampments, and exposed the dark underbelly of British Museum memes. I also want to shout out former Staff Writer Maya Pontone, particularly her stories on the impact of visa denials for artist residencies and beloved NYC nonprofits like Art in General and the Henry Street Settlement. The year began with the harrowing news of several blazes spreading across Los Angeles County, displacing thousands. Hyperallergic’s LA Correspondent Matt Stromberg was there through it all, documenting and making visible the scale of the tragedy. He spoke to artists who lost everything, covered the devastation of culturally rich Altadena, and reported on breaking developments as the art world grappled with how to move forward. Like most of the stories I considered standouts this year, my favorite by Stromberg shone a light on a less visible member of the arts community: Jorge Cruz, a street vendor often seen at museum and art fair events who was cruelly abducted by ICE despite having a green card. Over the last 12 months, we published pieces that rejected the status quo and demanded more of institutions and powerful individuals: scholar La Tanya S. Autry’s reflections and questions on the museum display of the gun that killed Emmett Till, Sarah Bond on the erasure of queerness from Elon Musk’s view of antiquity, Adam Broomberg’s challenge to Documenta’s concept of artistic freedom. Laurie Gwen Shapiro’s stranger-than-fiction feature on an authentic Eva Hesse painting plucked from a Goodwill auction and Zoë Lescaze’s intimate remembrance of the late artist Jackie Ferrara will stay with me for years to come. I’m also proud of the stories I authored, and grateful to Hyperallergic for letting me say the quiet part out loud — like that AI art is largely soulless, or that Beeple’s Miami pageantry was a distraction from the technologies that are rapidly emptying our souls. I covered the threats to Indigenous heritage brought by Alligator Alcatraz and the battle to preserve a David Wojnarowicz mural discovered under a layer of plywood in Kentucky. I looked back at the legacy of Latin American Art champion Carla Stellweg. I interviewed Tamara Lanier on the day of her historic victory against Harvard University, which had held on to the daguerreotypes of her enslaved ancestors for over a century. And today, I worked with Farfan and Nayyar on a story about the year's most compelling museum acquisitions, which you can also find linked below.What ties all these stories together? One answer is their pursuit of a more just and equitable world, made possible by the freedoms afforded to us as an independent publication. Independent means free from outside influence. There is no external stakeholder to ask us to pull a story. We can report freely on wrongdoings that major outlets are pushed to bury. \n\n                        We are doing this work solely for — and funded by — our readers.

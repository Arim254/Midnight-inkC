    "body": "\n\tin Business, Design |   \tNovember 21st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe humorist San­dra Tsing Loh once described her gen­er­a­tional cohort as “today’s young, high­ly trained, down­ward­ly mobile pro­fes­sion­als: ‘dump­ies.’ We’re just emerg­ing from years of col­lege only to learn that there are no jobs avail­able for peo­ple with our advanced qual­i­fi­ca­tions,” and thus no route to own­er­ship of all their hoped-for lifestyle accou­trements. No, she’s not a mil­len­ni­al, but rather what she calls a “late boomer” in an essay that dates from the mid-nineties — a few years after IKEA founder Ing­var Kam­prad “came into South­ern Cal­i­for­nia, utter­ing those five immor­tal words: ‘Halo­gen! Impos­si­ble Price: $29!’ The rest was his­to­ry. In that instant, we dump­ies found our niche. We rose up and became the IKEA Gen­er­a­tion!”\nIKEA could expand so far out of its native Swe­den thanks to the suc­cess of prod­ucts like the LACK cof­fee table, the sub­ject of the new Pri­mal Space video above. Though small in scale and high­ly unpre­pos­sess­ing in appear­ance (and, let’s face it, a visu­al byword for cheap fur­nish­ings sec­ond only to the num­ber-one-sell­ing BILLY book­shelf) it’s long been a steady sell­er the world over, not least because its price, just under the equiv­a­lent of ten euros when intro­duced in 1981, has nev­er been raised. To man­age that, IKEA has had to use every trick in its book: not just the do-it-your­self “flat-packed” design it pio­neered, but also non-warp­ing par­ti­cle board, hon­ey­comb paper struc­tures for max­i­mum strength using a min­i­mum of mate­r­i­al, and even new­ly engi­neered leg-fold­ing machines.\nHow­ev­er briskly it sells, this par­tic­u­lar prod­uct may be unfor­tu­nate­ly named in an Eng­lish-speak­ing mar­ket; “What they ‘lack’ is sta­bil­i­ty,” one inter­vie­wee says to Loh. Still, it remains emblem­at­ic enough of the cor­po­rate mis­sion once artic­u­lat­ed by Kam­prad him­self: “To cre­ate a bet­ter every­day life for the major­i­ty of peo­ple.” (“How many Repub­li­can politi­cians can say they’ve done that?” Loh adds. “How many Democ­rats?”) That extends to the design of IKEA’s stores, which offer only one path to fol­low all the way through, like an extra-large fun­house. As not­ed in the video, while this forces cus­tomers to pass every prod­uct — and thus every temp­ta­tion to impulse buy — it also turns a vis­it into an expe­ri­ence unto itself, before the cus­tomer even reach­es the cafe­te­ria. Fun­ny; I could go for a plate of meat­balls right about now.\nIf you want to take a deep dive into the ori­gin and growth of IKEA, lis­ten to this three hour episode from the Acquired pod­cast.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nIKEA Dig­i­tizes & Puts Online 70 Years of Its Cat­a­logs: Explore the Designs of the Swedish Fur­ni­ture Giant\nHans Rosling Uses Ikea Props to Explain World of 7 Bil­lion Peo­ple\nWhat Hap­pens When a Cheap Ikea Print Gets Pre­sent­ed as Fine Art in a Muse­um\nMeet the Mem­phis Group, the Bob Dylan-Inspired Design­ers of David Bowie’s Favorite Fur­ni­ture\nSpike Jonze’s Imag­i­na­tive TV Ads\nCharles & Ray Eames’ Icon­ic Lounge Chair Debuts on Amer­i­can TV (1956)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tNovember 20th, 2025  27 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAny­one who keeps an eye on Hol­ly­wood knows — indeed, has been ever more fre­quent­ly and anx­ious­ly informed — that the the­ater busi­ness is in trou­ble. If few­er of us than ever have been going out to the movies, one rea­son must have to do with the easy avail­abil­i­ty of home stream­ing, to say noth­ing of all the pro­lif­er­at­ing dig­i­tal dis­trac­tions pre­ci­sion-engi­neered to cap­ture our atten­tion. But could it also have to do with a change in the pic­tures them­selves? With more than two mil­lion views racked up in just four days, the new Like Sto­ries of Old video essay above ven­tures an expla­na­tion as to “Why Movies Just Don’t Feel ‘Real’ Any­more.”\nIn recent years, even long, colos­sal­ly bud­get­ed, and cease­less­ly mar­ket­ed spec­ta­cles feel strange­ly insub­stan­tial on any screen, big or small. The video’s cre­ator Tom van der Lin­den points to a vari­ety of fac­tors, begin­ning with a wors­en­ing lack of cor­re­spon­dence between the cin­e­mat­ic image and our per­cep­tion of real­i­ty.\nOne clear­ly — or rather, read­i­ly — notice­able con­tribut­ing trend is the preva­lence of shal­low focus, which keeps the char­ac­ters in the fore­ground sharp but lets all the details of the back­ground go blur­ry: not the way we see the real world, unless we mis­place our glass­es. Because we live in deep focus, deep focus cin­e­matog­ra­phy feels more real to us.\nOf course, not every movie can be Lawrence of Ara­bia. But there was a time when prac­ti­cal­ly all of them did deliv­er what’s called “hap­tic visu­al­i­ty,” the word hap­tic relat­ing to the con­cept of our sense of touch. Old­er films have a tan­gi­bil­i­ty about them in large part because the film­mak­ers had no choice: work­ing only or pri­mar­i­ly with ana­log tools, they could only do so much to detach images from our phys­i­cal expe­ri­ence. Dig­i­tal pho­tog­ra­phy, post-pro­duc­tion CGI, and now the open abyss of AI have made any­thing tech­ni­cal­ly pos­si­ble, though as van der Lin­den under­scores, those tech­nolo­gies by them­selves don’t guar­an­tee that the result­ing movie won’t feel real. Ulti­mate­ly, unre­al­i­ty is a choice, and one we movie­go­ers should hope the indus­try will stop mak­ing — if not for our sat­is­fac­tion, then for its own sur­vival.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Dark Knight: Anato­my of a Flawed Action Scene\nThe Impor­tance of Film Edit­ing Demon­strat­ed by the Bad Edit­ing of Major Films: Bohemi­an Rhap­sody, Sui­cide Squad & More\nWhy Mar­vel and Oth­er Hol­ly­wood Films Have Such Bland Music: Every Frame a Paint­ing Explains the Per­ils of the “Temp Score”\nWhy We All Need Sub­ti­tles Now\nWhy Do Wes Ander­son Movies Look Like That?\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the Karakoram Range on the northeastern border of Pakistan, a group of Indigenous women and girls is defying conventions with a seemingly simple pastime: soccer.\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan Girls Football League is a bastion of independence and autonomy amid a traditionally conservative environment. “In our culture, girls were brought up to be brides,” says Karishma, the co-founder of the league, in a short documentary about the movement. “Everybody doesn’t want to be a princess.”\n\n\n\nTitled “Girls Move Mountains,” the striking film is by Anna Huix, who visits this remote region and tags along with members of the Wakhi people as they practice and compete. As Huix shows, soccer is much more than a game for participants, who put themselves at risk in order to play. “As a child, Karishma faced harassment for wearing soccer attire, and as a woman, she battles online bullying from aggressive crowds challenging the rights of girls in the mountains,” the Barcelona-based filmmaker writes.\nWhile news clips highlight the backlash against the league, we also see Karishma’s grandmother, who supports the women and shares that she would have played the game had it been available to her.\nIf you’re in New York, you can see “Girls Move Mountains” at a screening for Dumbo Film Festival. Find more of Huix’s work on her website and Instagram. You also might enjoy Celia D. Luna’s portraits of these skateboarders.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has come through yet again with an unprecedented image from our Solar System, this time of a unique pair of Wolf-Rayet stars known as Apep. A Wolf-Rayet is a massive, very hot star that’s in the later stages of its life, quickly losing mass with the help of strong stellar winds. Thanks to Webb, researchers were able to observe coiled shells of dust around the pair for the first time. Previous documentation collected by other telescopes had only ever shown one dust shell.\nWhat makes this observation especially interesting is that there’s actually a third fiery orb at play here, which Webb’s new data confirms is gravitationally bound to the other two in this system. A massive supergiant, this third player “slices” holes into the dust shells—which have been emitted over the last 700 years—creating a unique effect. “To find the holes the third star has cut like a knife through the dust, look for the central point of light and trace a V shape from about 10 o’clock to 2 o’clock,” NASA says.\n\n\n\nThe celestial phenomena’s name, Apep, references the Egyptian god of chaos. Because while it may appear to be moving slowly, these swirling clouds race at a remarkable speed. “The dust-producing Wolf-Rayet stars in Apep aren’t exactly on a tranquil cruise,” NASA says. “They are whipping through space and sending out dust at 1,200 to 2,000 miles per second.” Because the dust is so dense, it shows up clearly in the image.\n“Webb’s data, combined with observations from the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, confirmed that the two Wolf-Rayet stars sail past one another approximately every 190 years,” says a statement. “Over each orbit, they make a close pass for 25 years, producing and spewing amorphous carbon dust.” \nFind more on NASA’s website.\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThere is always something a bit uncanny about Simon Laveuve’s playful miniatures. Whether a ramshackle residence is built impossibly tall or seems to be both upside-down and right-side-up at the same time, we’re drawn into a strange yet alluring world filled with a range of precisely rendered homes and hangouts.\nLaveuve is known for his meticulously sculpted miniatures that evoke post-apocalyptic settings, from stilt houses hovering precariously on rock formations to playful amalgamations of numerous “found objects” like tires and old windows. Typically crafted at 1/24 or 1/35 scale, these tiny tableaux are devoid of people yet feel lived in, as if the inhabitants have just stepped away.\n“La Beauté Des Aurores” (2025), from ‘Les Étoiles,’ mixed media, 1/35 scale, 19 x 28 x 13 centimeters\nSome of Laveuve’s sculptures feature multiple levels, while others focus on a particular interaction between, say, a beach umbrella that someone appears to have pitched not too long ago next to a car that has been abandoned for years, with giant roots growing through the hood. Whether installed on the wall or propped up on a post, the scenes reveal new details when viewed from different vantage points.\nLaveuve has been exceptionally productive lately, as Galerie Decorde just exhibited 10 pieces at an art fair in Strasbourg, France, and the artist has work included in Lucas Nadel’s show at Tagliatella Galleries in Paris, which opens on November 22 and continues through December 20. Among other projects, Galerie Decorde will also include Laveuve’s work in its December group show.\nCheck out Laveuve’s website, and follow updates on Instagram.\n“Rêve De Cime” (2025), from ‘Les Étoiles,’ mixed media, 1/35 scale, 34 x 16 x 11 centimeters\nDetail of “Rêve De Cime”\nDetail of “La Beauté Des Aurores”\n“Une Place Au Soleil” (2025) from ‘Vestige,’ mixed media, 1/24 scale, 31 x 26 x 20 centimeters\n“Jour De Fête” (2025), from ‘Vestige,’ mixed media, 1/24 scale, 38 x 26 x 18 centimeters\n“Jour De Fête” (2025), from ‘Vestige,’ mixed media, 1/24 scale, 38 x 26 x 18 centimeters\nDetail of “Jour De Fête” \n“Fleur d’IPN” (2025), from ‘Vestige,’ mixed media, 1/24 scale, 33 x 30 x 21 centimeters\nDetail of “Fleur d’IPN”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen I retire, I plan to read every morning and bake bread from scratch. I’d like to resume Spanish classes and finally become fluent. And I plan to see movies mid-afternoon, take long, leisurely walks leading nowhere in particular, and travel as much as possible. Does this sound familiar? \nDreaming of retirement is one coping mechanism many of us tap into, including director John Kelly. Along with his co-writer Tara Lawall, Kelly created a charming animated “Retirement Plan” detailing all the things he’d finally like to do as an older person no longer tethered to the office. He intends to play a single song impeccably on the piano, finally organize the pantry, and take a hike—or better yet, understand what the point of taking a hike is. \n\n\n\nWith the ability to make viewers both laugh and cry, the short film captures both the excitement of anticipation and the sometimes lackluster reality of finally diving in. As one commenter points out, the animation also checks a particular item off the protagonist’s list: “write a devastating yet optimistic piece of poetry.”\nWatch “Retirement Plan” above, and spend the rest of the day envisioning all the things you plan to do in that dreamworld we call retirement. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom cheese wedges and leafy greens to loaves of bread and freshly picked zucchini, Eléonore Joulin has a tendency for playing with her food. In the Brussels-based artist’s work, a loaf of challah transforms into a vase, while a melting round of Raclette—a cheese originating in Switzerland that’s scraped right off the wheel onto baguettes or potatoes—transforms into a lighting fixture.\nJoulin is known for her lighthearted lamps and vessels resembling vegetables, sausages, and other foods. She enjoys experimenting with glazes, handcrafting her own in order to find finishes and hues that create a trompe-l’œil effect—as if, for example, cabbage leaves were simply folded into the shape of shoes. The durability of ceramics adds a playful tension to her subject, as we expect greens to wither and bread to turn moldy, yet these never will.\n\nMost recently, Joulin spent nearly six months trying to create a glaze-and-texture combination that would mimic wood. “I tried a lot of different ways, including an oxide juice technique and a fake wood rubber tool used by carpenters, but I ended with a combination of three matte glazes,” she tells Colossal. “I’m thinking of doing a cuckoo clock now—stay tuned!”\nExplore even more on Joulin’s Instagram. You might also enjoy Stephanie Shih’s nods to “domestic bliss” and Naomi Peterson’s confectionary-inspired “cup-cakes.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo by Tiffany Camusci, courtesy Local 2110 UAW)\n    \n        \n            Staff at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City are officially unionized following a successful National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election, workers announced today, Friday, January 16.The formation of the Met Union under United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2110, which represents workers at cultural organizations across the city and elsewhere, comes months after staff first announced their intent to organize, cutting the need for pay parity, increased representation, and more transparency. Workers filed a petition with the NLRB, a step sometimes taken to form a union when the employing organization does not voluntarily recognize it, in November. The union will represent workers across 50 departments at the museum, including curators, librarians, conservators, visitor experience staff, and archivists. Originally, the union filed to represent 1,000 employees of the museum’s approximately 2,000-person workforce. Staff voted to form the union by a margin of 76%, with 542 voting in favor, 172 voting in opposition, and 100 not counted because the museum disputed their eligibility to belong to the union, according to UAW Local 2110.”We won because we were able to convince our colleagues that they don't have to accept whatever is offered to them, that their experience and hard work have earned them a seat at the table,” Rebecca Capua, a Met conservator, said in a statement released by UAW Local 2110.In a statement, a spokesperson for The Met said the institution “look[s] forward to engaging with the UAW as we pursue The Met’s mission to connect all people to creativity, knowledge, ideas, and one another.”“As one of the world’s leading art museums, The Met has long been committed to supporting its exceptional staff with highly competitive salaries and benefit packages that surpass industry standards; robust professional development opportunities; and a culture that values inclusivity, creativity, collaboration and excellence,” the spokesperson said. The institution said that over 600 of its employees earn more than $100,000 per year, and added that salaries have increased by 4% over the past five years. Alison Clark, a collections manager in the Asian Art Department, said in a statement that unionizing “is only our first step.”“We look forward to negotiating a fair and equitable contract that reflects staff needs and priorities,” Clark said.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Metropolitan Museum of Art\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

The 2026 Martin Luther King Jr. holiday unfolds in a year already punctuated by public outrage as the Trump administration defends Immigration and Customs Enforcement violence and seeks to erase the nation's racist history. At the Kennedy Center, which Trump retained control over last year after criticizing \"woke\" programming, an annual concert celebrating King, Let Freedom Ring, has opted to play elsewhere.Cultural institutions across New York City, including the newly reopened Studio Museum in Harlem, are upholding commitments to honor the civil rights leader on a day his wife once described as \"a focal point for encouraging improved race relations.\" Below are five events commemorating the civil rights titan's life and legacy — from family-friendly activities to Mayor Zohran Mamdani performing one of King's sermons at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.The Studio Museum in HarlemThe Studio Museum will hold thematic art-making events on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. (photo courtesy the Studio Museum)After a seven-year closure, the Studio Museum will celebrate its first-ever Martin Luther King Jr. Day in its new building on Monday, January 19. During a free day of programming at the Harlem museum campus, the institution will lead the public of all ages in activities commemorating King's activism. The day will begin with a children's storytime featuring books written or illustrated by individuals of African descent; later in the day, the museum will host thematic art-making workshops, and curators will tour visitors through resonant works in its collections. The event is free and open to the public. Brooklyn Children's MuseumFrom 10am to 5pm on Monday, the Brooklyn Children's Museum in Crown Heights will hold a day-long programming series including shadow puppetry, community service projects, and an appearance by Grammy-nominated musician and social justice advocate Harold \"FYÜTCH\" Simmons II. Tickets are $15. Wave Hill: Freedom Quilters of Gee’s BendRita Mae Pettway of Gee's Bend in 2005 with a quilt by her grandmother (photo by Ted Fitzgerald/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images)On Sunday, January 18, from 10 am to 1 pm, family members are invited to create fabric collages in honor of King and the legacy of Gee’s Bend quilters at the Wave Hill House in the Bronx. The activity draws upon the history of Gee’s Bend  in Alabama, home to one of the most extraordinary quilting traditions in American history. A group of Black craftswomen in the community formed the Freedom Quilting Bee cooperative after King visited the area in 1966. The event is free with admission to Wave Hill House. Beyond Vietnam: MLK’s Call for Peace at the New York HistoricalFrom 12 pm to 2 pm on Sunday, the New York Historical will hold a family-friendly activity drawing upon King's 1967 anti-war speech at Manhattan's Riverside Church, \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence.\" The institution will also host a peace sign wall-hanging workshop. The event is free with admission to the museum. BAM's 40th Annual King TributeA BAM Kids event celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (photo courtesy BAM)The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in the Fort Greene neighborhood is hosting its 40th annual tribute event on Monday, with a reading of Dr. King's “Drum Major Instinct” sermon performed by Mayor Zohran Mamdani and others.

This haunting, abraded pastel and paint work is part of the revelatory exhibition Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson.A longtime resident of Boston, a city that never developed an artistic identity as strong as New York’s or some other major US cities, Wilson was a painter, public sculptor, printmaker, teacher, children’s book illustrator, and activist. He was known and respected among fellow Black artists, yet practically invisible in the mainstream, White art world to the extent that his work is seldom included in surveys of modern and contemporary Black artists working in the United States. This much-needed exhibition — originating at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which holds the largest single collection of his art, at 90 works — should bring him the visibility he has long deserved.John Wilson, \"My Brother\" (1942), oil on panel; Smith College Museum of Art (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Wilson’s parents, who immigrated to the US from British Guiana (now Guyana), encouraged him to study art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. When he realized that Black people were not represented in the museum’s collection, he devoted himself to “witnessing [their] humanity.” This realization anticipates that of internationally recognized Black contemporary artists such as Kerry James Marshall, who told Griselda Murray Brown of the Financial Times, in 2018: \"It’s less about changing the narrative than it is about participating, being a part of it.”After graduating from Tufts University (which is connected to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts), he received the James William Paige Traveling Fellowship in 1947. It enabled him to go to Paris, where he studied with the French artist Fernand Léger. Wilson was attracted to Léger because of his socialist and humanist beliefs, and his commitment to celebrating the dignity of workers. These convictions would grow stronger for Wilson over the years, setting him apart from the American avant-garde’s growing commitment to art for art’s sake, a stance from which many Black artists felt understandably estranged, particularly at a time when the Civil Rights movement was beginning to foment.Installation view of Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (photo Hyla Skopitz, courtesy The Met)In the summer of 1949, after returning from Europe, Wilson taught at Camp Wo-Chi-Ca (an acronym for Worker’s Children’s Camp) in New Jersey, where he met Elizabeth Catlett and Paul Robeson. The next year, he visited Mexico on a John Hay Whitney Foundation grant, where he stayed until 1956, studying mural painting in Mexico City, and connecting with David Alfaro Siqueiros. His classmates included Catlett and Charles White, who would later teach and influence Kerry James Marshall’s art. Two things should be clear from Wilson’s biography. He, along with White, Catlett, and their peers, were where the action was and, like them, his story centers on being a Black artist determined to be “a part of the narrative,” particularly in terms of what it was like to live in the US in the 20th century. In this regard, Wilson is both important as an individual artist and essential to understanding American history and art. In fact, an institution should organize an exhibition highlighting the artists, writers, and others who taught at the interracial Camp Wo-Chi-Ca — among them, Jacob Lawrence, Gwendolyn Knight, and the dancer Pearl Primus. John Wilson, \"Streetcar Scene\" (1945), lithograph; The Metropolitan Museum of Art (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Wilson portrayed the gamut of the Black experience, making visible the sense of deep isolation, fear, and apprehension accompanying oppression and marginalization in the US, as well as pride, family, and community. His lithograph “Streetcar Scene” (1945) shows a Black Boston Navy Yard worker sitting in uniform on the streetcar, surrounded by mostly White women, all of whom ignore him. He looks at the viewer, his hands folded over his lunch box, dignified yet reticent, and highly conscious that he is the lone Black passenger. He seems to know in this situation that he must prove that he is nonthreatening — his uniform and button establish that he is a gainfully employed, productive member of society — and not interact with the other passengers.Among the exhibition’s 100-plus works is a charcoal drawing of Martin Luther King Jr. The face is both idealized and weary, while the torso is schematic. The horizontal and vertical lines dividing the head and torso can be read as a sign of King’s martyrdom and as the crosshairs of the assassin’s rifle. Nearby is a commanding eight-foot bronze maquette of King’s head, which was modeled in 1982 and cast in 2021. Also on view are pages from Wilson’s sketchbooks, including works from Paris and Mexico City that show him absorbing lessons from Léger and the Mexican muralists. I see these pieces as integral to his commitment to portraying the daily life of Black people in the US — their aspirations and fears. Anyone would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by Wilson’s synthesis of empathy and artistic ambition. In the 2002 “Self-Portrait” and the lithograph “City Child (1965), Wilson, inspired by Ralph Ellison’s novel Invisible Man (1952), addresses the invisibility experienced in this country by people of color. In the prologue, Ellison writes: “I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.” In a country where the president demonizes immigrants and people of color, Wilson’s work reminds us that beauty, art, and politics don’t have to be divided, and the right to be seen should never be decided by others.John Wilson and James Stroud, Center Street Studio, \"Martin Luther King Jr.\" (2002), etching and aquatint on chine collé; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson continues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1000 Fifth Avenue, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through February 8.

(photo by Brontë Wittpenn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\n    \n        \n            This week San Francisco’s California College of the Arts (CCA) announced plans to close by the end of the 2026-2027 school year. CCA’s campus will then be owned by Vanderbilt University.Citing CCA’s long-standing financial struggles, including “demographic shifts and a persistent structural deficit,” CCA President David C. Howse called the plan “a decisive act of stewardship.” Deficits? How can this be? San Francisco is dense with millionaires. It frequently boasts the highest number of billionaires anywhere. How does one of the wealthiest cities in the world lose its last and oldest progressive art school? Intentionally. I taught at a variety of Bay Area art schools including CCA prior to moving to the DC area in 2019. I was appointed Scholar in Residence at CCA’s Center for Art + Public Life from 2015 to 2017. Art and activism have been the focus of my work for years.CCA students in the author's summer intensive, Art & The City, visiting Transamerica Redwood Park, one of San Francisco's oldest Privately Owned Publicly Open Spaces (photo by and courtesy Christian L. Frock) I first wrote about San Francisco’s wealth disparity and artists’ exodus for KQED in 2014. The art scene has always struggled to attract technology wealth, and today’s crypto kings have yet to emerge as philanthropists defending the arts or freedom of expression.The loss of CCA should be considered in relation to staggering wealth disparities and lack of social investment, primarily perpetuated by the technology sector, much of which has tight alliances with today’s leadership in Washington, DC. The indifference of wealth that has long-vexed San Francisco is now a systemic threat to the national ecosystem. These connections are evident in sweeping changes aimed at dismantling the social safety net and the cultural landscape. Last year, when funding was slashed for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the domino effect decimated initiatives across the country. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolved recently and the fate of PBS and NPR now hangs in the balance. Take note of who suffers the impact from these losses — working-class people of all stripes, children, veterans, people with disabilities, marginalized and vulnerable communities. The list goes on, and it doesn’t include oligarchs.  While it is difficult to track daily pronouncements from Washington, DC, aimed at limiting freedom of expression, the relative silence of the technology sector in the face of these changes is equally alarming, particularly given its supposed values in creativity, experimentation, and innovation. Meanwhile, most influential technology headquarters are furnished with amazing private art collections that rival those of public museums.As San Francisco’s last remaining and oldest private arts and design school — CCA will be 120 years old when it sunsets — the institution has been an essential stakeholder in art history and American history by extension. I spoke with Shalini Agrawal, my former director at CCA’s Center for Art + Public Life, to ask for her thoughts. Previously Associate Professor in Critical Ethnic Studies and Interdisciplinary Studies, with a 17-year track record at CCA, Professor Agrawal considered the losses and the possibilities that might be left open.CCA students from Art & The City, a summer intensive taught by the author, visiting one of the city's then-newest Privately Owned Publicly Open Spaces in the LinkedIn HQ, featuring several large-scale Frank Stella artworks, in 2016 (photo by and courtesy Christian L. Frock) “CCA would always bring in the most progressive artists and thinkers in the departments I worked in … There was just a lot of excitement in bringing in different thinkers,” she told me. “The Bay Area has always been a nexus for creative thinking and social justice. As creative thinkers, we also solve hard problems — I hope something [new] will emerge from this … perhaps something grassroots.” In West Coast art school parlance, the grassroots are the gold standard for excellence — and historically speaking, community organizing at the grassroots level has been essential to bringing about change in the United States. Barack Obama’s candidacy for presidency was secured by $5 campaign fundraisers early on. Grassroots action brought about change, and it can again. 2028 is on the horizon.CCA’s absence will have a wide-reaching impact that will be hard to quantify. What calculations can be made to demonstrate a loss of imagination? CCA always attracted local, national, and international students — and teaching is like scattering seeds on the wind, knowing art and ideas can take root anywhere. My students were frequently engaged in social justice issues, deeply invested in diversity, equity, and inclusion, and always focused on building community. CCA’s legacy contains scores of talented creatives, all wildly dangerous to the status quo for their ability to imagine a more expansive future.Students enrolled in New Media and Cultural Memory at CCA, a course taught by the author, visiting San Francisco's recently debuted Comfort Women Memorial in fall 2017 (photo by and courtesy Christian L. Frock) Artist and CCA Professor Emeritus Chris Johnson is set to retire this year after 48 years of teaching at the college, dating to when it was called California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC). “I was preparing for what I assumed would probably be my last undergraduate class,” he posted on Facebook. “It’s just that I thought that the school would always be there, with all of the inspiring growth it provided. It’s all of those meaningful conversations and moments of encouragement and insight that will be missed.” After noting CCA’s plans for students who will graduate next year, Johnson added, “After that we will all have to come to terms with the vast changes in what it means to study art in Northern California.” The lack of support that has resulted in CCA’s closure feels like a betrayal perpetuated by the San Francisco Bay Area’s wealthiest residents, who may also be party to the battle for democratic values unfolding before us today, but I trust the college’s past and present communities will make good on the grassroots promise that remains in San Francisco. The names on the walls might change, but I still believe in artists, and I’ll never give up on the West Coast. Si se puede, as we learn to say in school. American labor leader and feminist activist Dolores Huerta said it first, President Barack Obama said it last, and I’ll say it again — yes, we can.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        California College of the Arts\n                      \n                      \n                        San Francisco\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            Sometimes you wake up to news headlines that don't make any sense. Take this one, for example: South Africa Axes Venice Biennale Proposal Centering Gaza Victims. You ask yourself: Wait a second, isn't South Africa the same country that accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice? Yes, it is, but it happens to have a right-wing arts and culture minister who found artist Gabrielle Goliath’s performance piece “highly divisive in nature.” He later came up with the bizarre, unfounded claim that a “foreign power” was involved in the artwork. Writer and scholar Christina Sharpe and University of Buffalo professor Rinaldo Walcott saw this and felt an immediate urge to respond. In a must-read piece this week, they lament a world in which the country that toppled Apartheid abandons its own revolutionary legacy. Meanwhile, the White House brings the Smithsonian to its knees, forcing the DC institution to submit all information — down to wall-label texts — about its programming to make sure it aligns with the president's worldview.

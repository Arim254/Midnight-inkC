    "body": "\n                News\n                Local artist Phil Buehler said he unveiled the memorial display to help people “see something that they otherwise can't see.”\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Phil Buehler's public art installation \"Wall of Tears\" in Bushwick (all images Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)\n    \n        \n            Spanning the 50-foot stretch between a hipster tea shop and a bar proudly displaying anti-ICE posters in Bushwick, a public installation by Brooklyn-based artist and photographer Phil Buehler confronts passersby with the names of the estimated 18,500 children killed by Israel in Gaza from October 2023 to July 2025. Amid freezing temperatures on Thursday, February 5, many pedestrians scurried past the list of names on Buehler’s temporary “Wall of Tears,” which is fastened to a fence at 12 Grattan Street with zip ties. Others walking by paused to read the names listed on the banner.Buehler is a Bronx-raised photographer whose public art projects have included portraits of the empty beds of Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces and documentation of Ferguson in mourning after the killing of Michael Brown. His latest work, produced in collaboration with Radio Free Brooklyn, will remain on view until February 15.  The wall lists 18,457 names of children reported dead by the Gaza Health Ministry from October 2023 to July 19, 2025.In a phone call with Hyperallergic, Buehler said he drew the names of children from data compiled by the Gaza Health Ministry, which was also reported by the Washington Post last summer. The names are arranged by date of death, and their documented gender is indicated by one of two shades of tan. The age of babies who were killed before their first birthday is marked by “<1.” The data set ends in July 2025. Buehler has created other banner-type works, including a 2022 “Wall of Liars and Deniers,” a 50-foot-long composition of Trump allies’ claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Another piece, “Wall of Shame” (2025), chronicled the alleged crimes of January 6 insurrectionists.Though similar in form, his latest memorial takes a different tone from his Trump-related works. Buehler said he read the Post's July report on the death toll among Gaza's children and wanted to use art to ensure that the information reaches as many people as possible.“I think art gets into your brain a different way than if you read a newspaper or social media. You can see it. It might be mysterious. It makes you discover something. It gets past some of your filters,” Buehler said. The installation will be on view until February 15.Buehler unveiled the work on the second anniversary of the death of five-year-old Hind Rajab, who was killed by the Israeli military while riding in her family's car on January 29, 2024. The moments leading up to Rajab’s murder were captured in a harrowing recording of the girl’s final pleas for help to Red Cross workers, sparking international outrage over Israel’s killing of Palestinian children. Among the 18,457 names on Buehler’s 50-by-10-foot banner, a ubiquitous graduation photo of Rajab peers out at Grattan Street. Photos of other children are interspersed with the other names on the display. An entry documenting the circumstances of the killing of Hind Rajab in 2024On Thursday, Buehler told Hyperallergic that he was preparing to invite local officials, including Mayor Zohran Mamdani, to an upcoming event at the Bushwick site this weekend.  He said he had recently come across a James Baldwin quote from 1973: “The role of the artist is exactly the same as the role of the lover. If I love you, I have to make you conscious of the things you don’t see.” This line prompted Buehler to reflect on his own work, including “Wall of Tears.”“Some people don't want to see things, or are unconscious of them,” Buehler said. “In addition to just adding more eyeballs to the story, I'm hoping maybe it opens some minds, or opens people to see something that they otherwise can't see.” Phil Buehler has produced other banner-type works and enlarged photographs commemorating children whose lives were upended by violence.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Palestine\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Despite the weather, the streets are crowded with determined shoppers. I’m feeling rather pleased with myself, having just scored a pair of jeans at 50% off, when I wander into one of those shops that sell nothing but Christmas decorations. After a few minutes wading through a thicket of fake trees, Santas, and reindeer, I’m about to turn around to leave, when I see it.Presented with improbable dignity in a golden box is a hanging ornament in the shape of the Trevi Fountain that comes with a “complimentary papal blessing.” Its roughly shaped details would be dull if the whole thing weren’t drowned in glitter. Under the shop lights, this perfect miniature of late Baroque architecture explodes in shine: a beacon promising a brighter future and a better life.Although it might be best known for its seasonal cameos at Christmastime, glitter turns up nearly everywhere, from cosmetics to credit cards to, of course, contemporary art.Christmas ornament in the shape of the Trevi Fountain (image by the author for Hyperallergic)The material has a resolutely American story. Its beginnings trace back to the late 1930s, when Henry Ruschmann, a German immigrant, patented a high-speed machine for cutting photographic prints, which produced small, glossy cellulose “schnibbles” as waste. When his employees began taking these discarded fragments home to use as artificial snow, glitter was born. Today, Ruschmann’s company produces every imaginable variety, from fluorescent and holographic to biodegradable, responding to growing concerns about microplastics.In his short 1979 ssay “Light in its Artistic Manifestations,” Hans Sedlmayr identifies “phototropic eras” defined by the discovery of new luminous materials and their artistic use: bronze, Greek marble, Byzantium’s golden glass mosaics, oil paint. It’s a shame that his study ends with mirrors in 17th-century France, as glitter surely deserves inclusion.Apse mosaic in the Basilica of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy, built in 547 CE (photo by Petar Milošević, courtesy the artist)Beyond reflecting and refracting light, glitter flattens the surfaces it adheres to — cover a sculpture in it, and dimension dissolves into a twinkling veneer. Andy Warhol’s famous remark that to understand him, one need only look at the surface of his paintings resonates in his use of diamond dust. Though not technically glitter, this pulverized glass conveys the same message: glamor achieved cheaply and mass-produced, a symbol of 20th-century American consumerism.Perhaps relatedly, glitter is often dismissed as frivolous. As Nicole Seymour notes in her 2022 book on the subject, it is “typically associated with marginalized identities and subject positions including children, girls, women, feminine people, drag performers, queer people, transgender people, and people of color — categories that, of course, overlap in various ways.” Detail of Ebony Patterson, \"Of 72\" (2011) (photo Sarah Rose Sharp/Hyperallergic)Indeed, its association with queer culture emerged with drag performances in the 1950s and persists today in the form of costumes, makeup, and performances in widely popular TV shows such as RuPaul’s Drag Race (2009–present). In the visual arts, glitter has been used to make the presence of such marginalized identities impossible to overlook. In the work of Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, glitter transforms everyday materials like cardboard and plastic into richly textured surfaces that evoke spiritual transcendence, camp aesthetics, and queer ornamentation, turning kitsch into devotion.Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt. “Lollipop Knick Knack (Let’s Talk About You)” (c. 1968–69), mixed media (photo courtesy Pavel Zoubok Gallery)Glitter also allows marginalized racial and ethnic communities to push back against imposed stereotypes. Quil Lemons’s 2017 photographic series GLITTERBOY features young Black men with their cheekbones dusted in glitter, highlighting how social expectations restrict expressions of identity and behavior outside hypermasculine norms. Here, shimmer becomes a visual insistence on visibility.These layered meanings, as well as the material’s longstanding association with “lower” forms of art, might explain why the art market is hesitant to embrace glitter-laden artworks. A recent walk around Art Basel Miami last December confirmed as much. Searching for sparkling canvases in this temple of the (mostly) American art market, I came across a multimedia 1990 painting by Lucio Muñoz, a couple of shiny tapestries by Ebony G. Patterson and Yvette Mayorga, and a colorful painting by Chris Martin. A canvas by Mickalene Thomas briefly engrossed me in its booth, though its shimmer came from rhinestones, a material better suited to her carefully controlled compositions.Mickalene Thomas, \"November 1977\" (2023), rhinestones on dye sublimation prints (photo Alexis Clements/Hyperallergic)That same evening, on my way to dinner, I wandered into a hotel lobby suspiciously repurposed as a small art fair. Amid derivative pop and graffiti art, I finally found the holy grail of glitter: swarms of iridescent butterflies and dubious portraits of Hollywood actors, all gleaming under a thick coat of sparkle. Indulging in this Salon des Refusés of shine, I began to notice the audience around me: blazers encrusted with cabochons, mirror dresses, miniskirts in lurex and lamé, iridescent scale tops … Had Sedlmayr lived long enough to witness this after-hours fair, he might have revised his chronology. Light slipped out of the grand halls of Versailles and into the margins, where it became unruly, synthetic, and defiantly cheap. Glitter does not monumentalize light; it democratizes it. And perhaps that is what makes it so difficult for some of the contemporary art world to accept.\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Glitter\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

After it was auctioned off, I found out that parts of my lost work were being sold online. \n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Detail of Damien Davis, \"My Brother and Me\" (2018) from the exhibition For Demetrius (2019) at Sugar Hill Children's Museum in New York (all photos courtesy the artist) \n    \n        \n            There is a particular kind of shame that comes with losing your own work.Not the spectacular kind. Not the kind that arrives with a public failure or a dramatic ending. This shame is quieter. It settles in the body. It convinces you not to tell anyone. It suggests that if you were more responsible, more successful, more organized, this would not have happened. It tells you that asking for help would only confirm what you already fear, that you were never supposed to need it in the first place.Years ago, I couldn’t afford the payment on a storage unit in the neighborhood of Greenpoint in north Brooklyn, where I had been keeping a large portion of my work. Sculptural components, unfinished pieces, modular elements, things that only made sense in relation to one another. The unit was auctioned off. There was no intervention, no warning. The archive simply changed hands.About a year later, a friend sent me an Instagram post and asked, almost casually, if the work in the background was mine. I recognized it immediately. Pieces from that storage unit were staged as interior décor by a Philadelphia-based vintage design shop. When I looked further, I found multiple posts offering parts of the work for sale. Not complete pieces, but components of singular works. Individual elements were photographed, priced, and listed under my name without tagging or contacting me. At the time, I had no idea this was happening. Parts of my practice were being dismantled, circulated, and monetized without my knowledge, their meaning flattened into décor.This was not just the loss of objects. It was the loss of authorship, sequencing, and context. Works that were never meant to exist independently were broken apart and reintroduced to the world as aesthetic fragments. My archive had become modular in the most violent sense. Not by choice, but by necessity and market indifference.In Archive Fever, Jacques Derrida describes the archive not as a neutral container, but as a site of authority, anxiety, and exclusion. The archive is never just about preservation. It is about who gets to decide what is kept, how it is ordered, and who has access to it. Losing control of my work was not only a material loss. It was a loss of archival authority. A reminder that preservation is always entangled with power, and that power rarely rests with the artist once the work leaves their hands.Artists are rarely taught how to talk about this. We are trained to see our studios as sacred spaces and our archives as extensions of ourselves. What we are not given are the material conditions to protect them. Storage, when you are living project to project, grant to grant, becomes a ticking clock. Miss one payment and the evidence of your labor is no longer yours.Public storage is sold as neutral infrastructure, a convenience. For artists, it is often a site of profound vulnerability. These spaces are subject to floods, fires, mold, theft, rodents, and power failures. They are not designed to preserve culture. They are designed to extract monthly fees. The longer you stay solvent, the longer your work survives. The moment you falter, the archive becomes disposable.In September of last year, a fire tore through an iconic artist studio building in Brooklyn, destroying decades of work in a matter of hours. Studios that had housed entire careers were reduced to debris overnight. The loss was not abstract. It was total. What that fire made visible was not only the fragility of materials, but the absence of meaningful infrastructure to protect artists’ archives before catastrophe strikes. Disaster does not discriminate, but its consequences do. Artists without generational wealth, without secondary storage, without institutional backing are always the most exposed. That fire was not an anomaly. It was part of a longer pattern of loss that artists have been absorbing quietly for years.One of the structural conditions that makes archival precarity so acute is the constant threat of environmental disaster. Storms, floods, fires, and other climate events can erase entire bodies of work in a matter of hours. After Hurricane Sandy, galleries in Chelsea were still recovering years later, with basement studios, storage spaces, and ground-floor archives damaged or destroyed by floodwaters that swept through downtown Manhattan. More than a decade on, the scars of that event are still felt, not only in the work that was lost, but in the ways artists and institutions continue to relate to space, risk, and memory. Dealers and artists alike were left to rebuild what had been made vulnerable by an infrastructure that placed cultural material below flood lines and away from meaningful protection. The question that lingered was not only financial but existential. How do you reconstruct the thread of a practice when its physical record has been submerged? This history is not distant. It is a reminder that the systems surrounding art storage and display remain brittle in the face of storms that climate scientists now tell us are worsening, and that preservation in the arts is still treated as an individual responsibility rather than a shared obligation.Family photograph of the artist and his brother, c. 1988 One of the works that was broken apart and sold off from my storage unit had been part of my exhibition For Demetrius at the Sugar Hill Children’s Museum in 2019. The show was named for my late brother, who died from sickle cell disease in 2009, and it marked the tenth anniversary of his passing. That work was never meant to circulate casually. It was an act of remembrance, a way of holding grief in form. Knowing that it had been dismantled and redistributed without context was emotionally devastating in a way that is difficult to explain. It felt like a second loss, quieter than the first, but no less final.Recently, news circulated about a breakthrough gene therapy that has effectively cured sickle cell disease in at least one patient. I read it with a complicated mix of relief and grief. Scientific progress arrived too late to change my brother’s life, just as recognition arrived too late to protect the work that bore his name. These timelines do not align. They rarely do. What remains is the knowledge that some forms of care only appear after loss has already done its work.What connects the storage unit, the fire, and the auction is not just money. It is performance. Artists are expected to perform being okay when they often are not. The art world rewards the appearance of stability. It punishes visible need.In my previous writing about art auctions, I was thinking about spectacle. About how auctions stage confidence, inevitability, and demand. How value is performed in real time, with no room for hesitation. What becomes clearer here is the psychic toll of that performance. Auctions teach us that worth must never waver. The hammer comes down. The price is set. Everyone pretends this outcome was natural.Shame enters when an artist’s reality cannot sustain that fiction.There is shame in admitting you cannot afford storage. Shame in saying you missed a payment. Shame in asking for help before the crisis becomes irreversible. Shame in revealing that the archive, the thing institutions later rely on to narrate your significance, is one accident away from disappearance. This shame is not incidental. It is structural. It keeps artists performing competence while absorbing risk privately.Artists learn early how to be okay. We learn how to downplay instability. We learn how to smile through precarity. We learn how to turn survival into narrative resilience. What we do not learn is how to ask for help without fear of being seen as unprofessional or unviable. Silence feels safer, even when it isn’t. What often goes unacknowledged is that these moments do not end when the immediate crisis passes. Like storms or fires, they leave scars that shape how artists move through the world long after the damage is no longer visible.The auction clarifies the asymmetry. When work appears at auction, it is framed as success regardless of whether the artist benefits. When work is lost through a storage auction, it is framed as personal failure. Both are auctions. Only one is allowed to confer legitimacy. The other produces silence.\"When work is lost through a storage auction, it is framed as personal failure.\" Family photo of artist with his brother. This is why shame becomes part of the archive. Not just the shame of losing work, but the shame of nearly losing it. The shame of hiding instability. The shame of knowing the system prefers artists who can absorb risk quietly. These residues accumulate alongside objects, sketches, files, and fragments. They shape what artists keep, what they discard, and what they stop trusting themselves to hold.In this sense, the precarious archive is not only material. It is psychological. It is the ongoing labor of maintaining the appearance of being okay long enough for the market to catch up, or for institutions to intervene, or for history to decide you were worth preserving. When that performance fails, the consequences are real.If the archive is precarious, survival cannot be an individual project. Fred Moten, writing with Stefano Harney in The Undercommons, offers language for thinking about life and labor outside institutional recognition. The undercommons names the informal, relational networks people build when official structures fail them. For many artists, this is already how preservation works, through shared storage, borrowed space, mutual aid, and artist-run experiments that refuse the logic of scarcity.There are no perfect solutions, only survival strategies. Some artists digitize aggressively. Some make rules about what must remain intact and what can be released. Some negotiate storage with galleries or collectors. Some rely on friends, informal networks, or shared spaces. Writing becomes an archive too, a way of preserving intention when material evidence is unstable.None of this erases the underlying problem. It names it. The precarious archive is not an anomaly. It is a condition of contemporary artistic life. It asks artists to imagine a future audience while living in a present that offers very little security.To name this is not to confess failure. It is to refuse the lie that artists are solely responsible for their own erasure. The archive is not just a personal burden. It is a cultural infrastructure. If we care about artists’ legacies, we have to care about the conditions under which those legacies are allowed to survive, long before the market decides they matter.For now, many artists continue to work knowing their archives exist on borrowed time. One missed payment. One storm. One fire. The work persists anyway, not because the system protects it, but because artists keep making it.That endurance deserves more than silence.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tIn mid-December, on a tour of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, Abby Jones, the acting chief of protocol at the State Department, floated the idea that the Smithsonian should create a dedicated gallery featuring multiple images of President Donald Trump, according to the New York Times. This, of course, would be in addition to his official portrait.\n\n\tLater, administration officials noted that the White House regularly receives artworks depicting the President from supporters and suggested that some of it could be displayed at the museum.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“President Trump receives an unprecedented amount of beautiful artwork from patriotic Americans all across our great country,” a statement released by the White House said, “and it is important to the People’s President that their creations are showcased throughout the halls of our Nation’s Capital.”\n\n\tThere is no formal proposal on the table, the Times reported, and it remains unclear how seriously the idea is being considered, since the Smithsonian has not received an official request.\n\n\tThe National Portrait Gallery regularly includes more than one image of past Presidents in its permanent installation. But the museum’s standard practice has been to debut its commissioned portraits only after a President has completed his time in office.\n\n\tThe discussion follows a recent change at the museum. Last month, the gallery replaced Trump’s original official photograph with a different image he found more flattering. At the same time, it removed wall text referencing his two impeachments. The museum said the changes were part of a “broader update” to the exhibition and that the history of impeachments continues to be addressed elsewhere in its galleries.\n\n\tTensions between the White House and the Smithsonian have nearly boiled over since the start of Trump’s second term. The president has criticized what he described as ideological bias in museum displays and has pressed the institution for detailed information about its content and finances. Smithsonian officials, meanwhile, say that the institution operates independently of the executive branch.\n\n\tIn the meantime, visitors to the National Portrait Gallery can already see Trump’s current official image: a black-and-white photograph by White House photograph Daniel Torok showing the president scowling over the Resolute Desk. Whether that single portrait eventually gains company remains an open question, but despite professing its autonomy, the museum leadership have in the past buckled under White House pressure. Last year, the President said he had fired Kim Sajet, then the museum’s director, for a variety of reasons, including the wall texts that mentioned Trump’s impeachment. Sajet continued reporting to work before resigning.\n",

    "body": "\n\tJack Lang, the former French culture minister, stepped down as president of the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris after his name surfaced in newly released Jeffrey Epstein files, according to the Guardian.\n\n\tLang, who served two terms as culture minister under President François Mitterrand, resigned on Saturday amid mounting scrutiny. He had led the Institut du Monde Arabe since 2013.\n\n\tThe immediate catalyst was a tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice on January 30. In those files, Lang and his daughter, Caroline Lang, appear among hundreds of public figures whose names are connected in some way to Epstein’s vast web of contacts. Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tTheir inclusion in the files does not in itself suggest any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s crimes. Still, the fallout in France was swift. \n\n\tProsecutors announced that they had opened a preliminary investigation into Jack and Caroline Lang for alleged “aggravated tax fraud money laundering,” a move that increased political pressure. Lang was reportedly summoned to the French Foreign Ministry at the request of President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu. Rather than wait for that meeting, he chose to resign.\n\n\tIn a letter explaining his decision, Lang described the current atmosphere as toxic and said he was stepping aside to shield the institution from further harm. Speaking to Agence France-Presse, he called the accusations “baseless” and said he welcomed the investigation because it would confirm that he had done nothing wrong.\n\n\tThe attention has centered in part on Caroline Lang’s past business dealings. Files show that in 2016 she partnered with Epstein in a company called Pyrtanée LLC, which was described as focusing on acquiring works by emerging French artists. \n\n\tShe has said she was introduced to Epstein by Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn in 2012 and characterized her involvement as naïve. She told investigators that she did not invest in or receive funds from the US Virgin Islands–registered company and that its legal and financial structures were handled by Epstein’s lawyers.\n\n\tAs scrutiny intensified, she resigned from her role as managing director of France’s Independent Producer Syndicate and from the board of the TV festival Series Mania.\n\t\n\n\tJack Lang’s stature makes the episode especially striking. As culture minister in the 1980s and early 1990s, he was instrumental in expanding access to the arts and launched the annual Fête de la Musique, now celebrated worldwide. \n\n\tHis leadership at the Institute du Monde Arabe had become part of that legacy, positioning him as a bridge between France and the Arab world. His resignation closes a chapter that stretches back to the early Mitterrand years.\n\n\tLang confirmed to the French press that he had met Epstein years ago and said he was shocked when the financier’s crimes became public. He has framed the relationship as casual and insists he never received funds tied to Epstein’s activities.\n\n\tEpstein embedded himself in the cultural sphere and had myriad connections to the art world. He maintained a personal art collection, engaged with collectors such as Ronald Lauder and Leon Black, and corresponded with figures across museums, universities, and galleries. His network also extended to board members of institutions like the New York Academy of Art and to major donors linked to museums and research centers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne of the seven wonders of the ancient world, according to traditional lists, the Lighthouse of Alexandria once loomed over the Mediterranean city’s harbor during Egypt’s Hellenistic age. At 460 feet tall, it was second only to the Great Pyramid of Gaza in height.\n\n\tThe lighthouse, also known as the Pharos of Alexandria, was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter (c. 367–283 B.C.), a Macedonian Greek general under Alexander the Great who became pharaoh of Egypt; it was seen to completion by his son and successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus. During the Ptolomaic dynasty, which lasted 300 years, Alexandria was a center of Greek culture in Egypt.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tLocated on the island of Pharos off the coast of Alexandria, the lighthouse was constructed of stone and was rectangular at the bottom, octagonal in the middle, and cylindrical at the top. It used mirrors and a furnace to guide ships to the city’s harbor.\n\n\tThe building, already weakened by previous tremblors, was destroyed by the 1303 Crete earthquake, most of its remains disappearing under rising seas. Now, however, as reported in the New York Times, a group of historians, architects, and programmers are working to create a digital 3-D model of the ancient structure.\n\n\t“The architectural fragments lie scattered over 18 acres underwater,” Isabelle Hairy, an archaeologist at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and the Center for Alexandrian Studies in Egypt and leader of the Pharos Project team, told the Times.\n\n\tLast summer, the Pharos Project team used a crane to bring granite blocks and other relics to the surface so they could be scanned and digitally positioned in the 3-D model. One major discovery was a pylon combining Greek building skills with Egyptian stylistic elements.\n\n\tSo far, the project has made seabed scans of some 5000 building elements and artifacts on the sea floor; worsening water conditions, however, make it likely that further scans will rely on raising submerged material from the water before returning it to the sea for preservation. “The visibility is extremely bad,” Hairy told the Times, “the seabed is uneven and there are no clear layers of sediment.” Because of this, she estimates it will take generations to complete the project.\n",

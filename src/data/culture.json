    "body": "\n\tin English Language |   \tFebruary 6th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n“The three vol­umes of Green’s Dic­tio­nary of Slang demon­strate the sheer scope of a life­time of research by Jonathon Green, the lead­ing slang lex­i­cog­ra­ph­er of our time. A remark­able col­lec­tion of this often reviled but end­less­ly fas­ci­nat­ing area of the Eng­lish lan­guage, it cov­ers slang from the past five cen­turies right up to the present day, from all the dif­fer­ent Eng­lish-speak­ing coun­tries and regions. Total­ing 10.3 mil­lion words and over 53,000 entries, the col­lec­tion pro­vides the def­i­n­i­tions of 100,000 words and over 413,000 cita­tions. Every word and phrase is authen­ti­cat­ed by gen­uine and ful­ly-ref­er­enced cita­tions of its use, giv­ing the work a lev­el of author­i­ty and schol­ar­ship unmatched by any oth­er pub­li­ca­tion in this field.”\nIf you head over to Ama­zon, that’s how you will find Green’s Dic­tio­nary of Slang pitched to con­sumers. The dic­tio­nary is an attrac­tive three-vol­ume, hard-bound set. But it comes at a price. $1,327.78.\nNow comes the good news. Green’s Dic­tio­nary of Slang has become avail­able as a free web­site, giv­ing you access to an even more updat­ed ver­sion of the dic­tio­nary. Col­lec­tive­ly, the web­site lets you trace the devel­op­ment of slang over the past 500 years. And, as Men­tal Floss notes, the site “allows lookups of word def­i­n­i­tions and ety­molo­gies for free, and, for a well-worth-it sub­scrip­tion fee, it offers cita­tions and more exten­sive search options.” If you’ve ever won­dered about the mean­ing of words like kid­ly­wink, gol­lier, and lint­head, you now know where to begin.\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nA parrot confined to a too-small cage, jellyfish floating above fungi and ferns, and a spotted octopus resting as the centerpiece to a flourishing bouquet are a few of the surreal scenes in the works of Martin Wittfooth. The artist is known for his enigmatic paintings that meld flora and fauna to consider interconnection and nature’s endurance.\nWittfooth currently splits his time between Savannah and Brockville, although he plans to relocate permanently to the latter this year. Before he begins preparing for a solo exhibition in spring 2027 with Hashimoto Contemporary, the artist is completing a few larger commissions. \n“Dam”\nHe enjoys the balance between larger bodies of work and singular pieces: “A unified field of concepts and vibes, to have all of the pieces in an exhibition have a kind of kindred dialogue going on between one another, and then when the dust settles in between shows, to have singular works to focus on, where I can slow down just a bit and let the new ideas start to form for the next show,” he says.\nAlong with Yuko Shimizu, Wittfooth will also mentor at the unique Quarantine residency this April. This is his third time participating in the program, and it’s one that informs much of the way he thinks about connection. He’s always impressed by “how quickly bonds form between the students, between the mentors, between the students and the mentors, and with the whole crew that runs the show,” he says, adding: \n\nThere’s been a lot of emphasis on this notion that community is important—as a species, we’ve appreciated this in our various ways for as long as we’ve been around—but for artists, this is often a bit of a struggle to develop and to maintain, considering the isolating nature of how we work. It’s also something that seems to have become more broadly murky and confused in this era of social media, with person-to-person contact being replaced by virtual interactions and projection of virtual selves—methods of communication that I personally feel are missing the essential ingredient of connection.\n\nYou can find more about the program on Colossal, and explore Wittfooth’s work on his website and Instagram.\n“Parallelism Jellyfish 2”\n“The Alchemist”\n“Parallelism Paradise”\n“Liberty”\n“Parallelism 9”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(all screenshots via Department of Justice)In a document containing photographs sent to Jeffrey Epstein’s personal email address, the Department of Justice (DOJ) made a curious redaction, placing a black square on the face of one of the most ubiquitous portraits in the world. While the DOJ faces intense scrutiny for releasing sensitive information about Epstein's victims, including social security numbers and uncensored nude photos, in its recent document release, the federal agency decided to cover the face of what appears to be a reproduction of Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.”The altered “Mona Lisa” appears in a document containing photographs emailed to Epstein in 2009, with the subject line “simply paris.” Several photos in the email portray a young couple, including a woman whose face is redacted and an unnamed man. Photos in the email show the young couple at famous tourist destinations in Paris, including the Arc de Triomphe and inside the Louvre Museum.Redacted photos in a July 2009 email to Epstein titled \"simply paris\"The redacted image of Mona Lisa appears to be a reproduction of the artwork, not the actual painting, though in another photograph in the email, an individual can be seen walking past the glass-covered painting hanging in the Louvre. “We just walked around all over the city not just the sight seeing [sic]... we took like 1500 pictures so was really difficult to decide wich [sic] to send!” the email, sent by a redacted contact, said.The email is dated July 3, 2009, weeks before Epstein was released from jail following his Florida conviction for charges including soliciting prostitution from a minor. The redaction of the Mona Lisa feels particularly misguided as the DOJ faces accusations of releasing identifying information about about 100 Epstein survivors in their latest release of documents related to the convicted child sex offender. One lawyer for a survivor claimed his client was named over 500 times in the files. According to the New York Times, 40 images contained unredacted nude photos and the faces of seven individuals. After the publication notified the DOJ, a spokesperson said it was in the process of making proper redactions. The most recent tranche of Epstein files has also revealed new connections between the disgraced financier and art world figures. David A. Ross, the former chair of the School of Visual Arts MFA Art Practice Department, resigned from his post following the release of his email exchanges with Epstein. Emails also showed that Jeff Koons attended a dinner at Epstein's home years after his conviction.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Jeffrey Epstein\n                      \n                  \n        ",

She achieved this by reintroducing the hand and drawing into painting at a time when it was dominated by a stylized aesthetic, while utilizing different media and processes in each work: Using oil paint, acrylic, flashe, oil stick, ink, ballpoint pen, colored pencil, markers, and other diverse, seemingly incommensurable materials, she stains the canvas, creates flat and feathery shapes, and defines open-ended, linear constructions. The result is a cacophonous symphony of individual marks, shapes, and colors that somehow coheres without obscuring the individuality of each element. Her tour de force compositions feel discovered in the process of their becoming. The 13 paintings, three ballpoint pen drawings, and five ceramic sculptures in her current exhibition, Amnesia, at Nino Mier Gallery (all untitled and dated between 2010 and 2025) reveal even more sides of her multi-pronged approach to art. For example, she’s used a metallic glaze for one ceramic work, and silver leaf and an oil-based Sharpie for another. It is as if different people made them, but all are somehow Joanne Greenbaum. Joanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2014), oil, acrylic, flashe and graphite on canvasIn a conversation with artist Amy Sillman, Greenbaum said of her creative process:I don’t really scrape away. I just keep adding until the painting feels like it doesn’t need anything more. But there has to be lots of air in there, otherwise it’s claustrophobic.In a 2014 painting, colored lines coalesce into various configurations, which peek through flat, curving, monochromatic, and puzzle-like shapes rendered in a variety of oranges, blues, reds, pinks, and violets. Placed atop this layered composition is a large, slitted black form that seems to alternate between two and three dimensionality. While the different strata feel connected, it is unclear how, as she’s followed no discernible formula. As powerful as this combination of elements is, Greenbaum doesn’t turn it into a recipe for success — there is no other painting like this in Amnesia.Joanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2016), ballpoint pen, marker, and flashe on canvasJoanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2016), oil-based Sharpie on white stonewareFor a 2016 work, Greenbaum draws irregular concentric circles in ballpoint pen that culminate in an opaque spot near the center. The composition is reminiscent of water emptying down a drain, yet the bubble gum pink ground severs any connection we might make to a real-life scene while elevating the imagery into something that can only happen in paint. Greenbaum is disinterested in resemblance; however, her ability to evoke associations, even as she underscores that we are looking at paint and marks on a canvas, is one of the interesting paradoxes of her art. The dimensional blue and pink shape in a 2013 work looks like nothing we know, while a 2025 painting might bring to mind an aerial view of a futuristic city. That Greenbaum can traverse a perceptual territory that moves from object to place to action without ever crossing the line into representation is just one of the many pleasures of her art. There is an infectious fun to it that has nothing to do with style or statement. That deep-seated satisfaction of making something wild out of the banal — which is rare in art and poetry — can also be found in Joe Brainard’s experimental memoir, I Remember (1970), and the poetry of Frank O’Hara, who wrote “Grace to be born and live as variously as possible.”Joanne Greenbaum, \"Untitled\" (2013), oil, ink, acrylic, oil stick, and colored pencil on canvasJoanne Greenbaum: Amnesia continues at Nino Mier Gallery (62 Crosby Street, Soho, Manhattan) through February 21.

Others walking by paused to read the names listed on the banner.Buehler is a Bronx-raised photographer whose public art projects have included portraits of the empty beds of Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces and documentation of Ferguson in mourning after the killing of Michael Brown. His latest work, produced in collaboration with Radio Free Brooklyn, will remain on view until February 15.  The wall lists 18,457 names of children reported dead by the Gaza Health Ministry from October 2023 to July 19, 2025.In a phone call with Hyperallergic, Buehler said he drew the names of children from data compiled by the Gaza Health Ministry, which was also reported by the Washington Post last summer. The names are arranged by date of death, and their documented gender is indicated by one of two shades of tan. The age of babies who were killed before their first birthday is marked by “<1.” The data set ends in July 2025. Buehler has created other banner-type works, including a 2022 “Wall of Liars and Deniers,” a 50-foot-long composition of Trump allies’ claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Another piece, “Wall of Shame” (2025), chronicled the alleged crimes of January 6 insurrectionists.Though similar in form, his latest memorial takes a different tone from his Trump-related works. Buehler said he read the Post's July report on the death toll among Gaza's children and wanted to use art to ensure that the information reaches as many people as possible.“I think art gets into your brain a different way than if you read a newspaper or social media. You can see it. It might be mysterious. It makes you discover something. It gets past some of your filters,” Buehler said. The installation will be on view until February 15.Buehler unveiled the work on the second anniversary of the death of five-year-old Hind Rajab, who was killed by the Israeli military while riding in her family's car on January 29, 2024. The moments leading up to Rajab’s murder were captured in a harrowing recording of the girl’s final pleas for help to Red Cross workers, sparking international outrage over Israel’s killing of Palestinian children. Among the 18,457 names on Buehler’s 50-by-10-foot banner, a ubiquitous graduation photo of Rajab peers out at Grattan Street. Photos of other children are interspersed with the other names on the display. An entry documenting the circumstances of the killing of Hind Rajab in 2024On Thursday, Buehler told Hyperallergic that he was preparing to invite local officials, including Mayor Zohran Mamdani, to an upcoming event at the Bushwick site this weekend.  He said he had recently come across a James Baldwin quote from 1973: “The role of the artist is exactly the same as the role of the lover. If I love you, I have to make you conscious of the things you don’t see.” This line prompted Buehler to reflect on his own work, including “Wall of Tears.”“Some people don't want to see things, or are unconscious of them,” Buehler said. “In addition to just adding more eyeballs to the story, I'm hoping maybe it opens some minds, or opens people to see something that they otherwise can't see.” Phil Buehler has produced other banner-type works and enlarged photographs commemorating children whose lives were upended by violence.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Palestine\n                      \n                  \n        ",

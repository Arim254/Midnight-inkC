    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tDecember 3rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPaul Thomas Ander­son­’s lat­est film, the loose Thomas Pyn­chon adap­ta­tion One Bat­tle After Anoth­er, serves up many a mem­o­rable scene. But for a cer­tain kind of cinephile, noth­ing — not the ter­ror­ist attacks, not the chas­es, not the swerves into askew com­e­dy — sticks in the mind quite so much as the moment in which Leonar­do diCapri­o’s stoned pro­tag­o­nist tunes in to a broad­cast of Gillo Pon­tecor­vo’s The Bat­tle of Algiers. First released in 1966 (and cur­rent­ly free to watch on YouTube in cer­tain regions), that pic­ture has now been a main­stay of film-stud­ies syl­labi long enough that one for­gets just how much it would have star­tled its ear­li­est view­ers, more than a few of whom had no idea whether they were watch­ing a war movie or gen­uine Alger­ian War news­reel footage.\n\n\n\t\n\nSome of those view­ers includ­ed major film­mak­ers, not least Stan­ley Kubrick, who lat­er described all films as “false doc­u­men­taries,” and Pon­tecor­vo’s work as an espe­cial­ly impres­sive exam­ple there­of. Antho­ny Frewin, who worked as Kubrick­’s per­son­al assis­tant, remem­bers the direc­tor telling him that “I could­n’t real­ly under­stand what cin­e­ma was capa­ble of with­out see­ing The Bat­tle of Algiers. He was still enthus­ing about it pri­or to his death.”\nThe new Stu­dioBinder video at the top of the post also includes tes­ti­mo­ni­als from a host of oth­er auteurs includ­ing Wern­er Her­zog, Steven Soder­bergh, Oliv­er Stone, Alfon­so Cuarón, Spike Lee, Mira Nair, and Christo­pher Nolan.\n\n\n\t\n\nKathryn Bigelow — who, as the direc­tor of pic­tures like The Hurt Lock­er and Zero Dark Thir­ty, knows some­thing about spin­ning recent mil­i­tary con­flicts into com­pelling, real­is­tic thrillers — pulled The Bat­tle of Algiers from the shelves on her vis­it to the Cri­te­ri­on Col­lec­tion’s clos­et. She calls it “prob­a­bly my favorite movie of all time,” adding that “the metronome of ten­sion is almost insuf­fer­able, but I say that as a com­pli­ment.” A young Roger Ebert, in his con­tem­po­rary review of the film, warned that it “may be a deep­er film expe­ri­ence than many audi­ences can with­stand: too cyn­i­cal, too true, too cru­el and too heart­break­ing. It is about the Alger­ian war, but those not inter­est­ed in Alge­ria may sub­sti­tute anoth­er war.”\n\n\n\t\n\nSuch a “uni­ver­sal frame of ref­er­ence” is also com­mon to the oth­er high­lights of the Ital­ian neo­re­al­ist move­ment, which also include Rober­to Rossellini’s Rome, Open City, Vit­to­rio De Sica’s Bicy­cle Thieves, and Luchi­no Vis­con­ti’s The Earth Trem­bles, with their stark black-and-white cin­e­matog­ra­phy, their real, often still war-torn loca­tions, and their most­ly non-pro­fes­sion­al actors. Despite their ven­er­a­bil­i­ty, these films can remind even us twen­ty-first-cen­tu­ry view­ers who feel as if we’ve seen it all just how much cin­e­mat­ic poten­tial remains untapped. As Paul Thomas Ander­son puts it, “It’s always a good idea to watch The Bat­tle of Algiers again, just as a cin­e­mat­ic exer­cise to get you excit­ed” — no alter­ation of con­scious­ness required before­hand.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nStan­ley Kubrick’s List of Top 10 Films: The First and Only List He Ever Cre­at­ed\nFear and Desire: Stan­ley Kubrick’s First and Least-Seen Fea­ture Film (1953)\nHow Post­war Ital­ian Cin­e­ma Cre­at­ed La Dolce Vita and Then the Paparazzi\nAni­mat­ed Intro­duc­tions to Edward Said’s Ground­break­ing Book Ori­en­tal­ism\nThe Film Music of Ennio Mor­ri­cone (RIP) Beau­ti­ful­ly Per­formed by the Dan­ish Nation­al Sym­pho­ny Orches­tra Play: “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” & Much More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Life |   \tDecember 3rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nWith the old joke about every gen­er­a­tion think­ing they invent­ed sex, List­verse brings us the papyrus above, the old­est depic­tion of sex on record. Paint­ed some­time in the Rames­side Peri­od (1292–1075 B.C.E.), the frag­ments above—called the “Turin Erot­ic Papyrus” because of their “dis­cov­ery” in the Egypt­ian Muse­um of Turin, Italy—only hint at the frank ver­sions of ancient sex they depict (see a graph­ic par­tial recon­struc­tion at the bot­tom of the post—probably NSFW). The num­ber of sex­u­al posi­tions the papyrus illustrates—twelve in all—“fall some­where between impres­sive­ly acro­bat­ic and unnerv­ing­ly ambi­tious,” one even involv­ing a char­i­ot. Apart from its obvi­ous fer­til­i­ty sym­bols, writes archae­ol­o­gy blog Ancient Peo­ples, the papyrus also has a “humor­ous and/or satir­i­cal” pur­pose, and prob­a­bly a male audience—evidenced, per­haps, by its resem­blance to 70’s porn: “the men are most­ly unkempt, unshaven, and bald­ing […], where­as the women are the ide­al of beau­ty in Egypt.”\n\nIn fact the erot­ic por­tion of the papyrus was only made pub­lic in the 1970s. Egyp­tol­o­gists have known of the larg­er scroll, tech­ni­cal­ly called “Papyrus Turin 55001” since the 1820s. On the right side of the papyrus (above) ani­mals per­form var­i­ous human tasks as musi­cians, sol­diers, and arti­sans. The artist meant this piece too as satire, Ancient Peo­ples alleges. Like ancient Roman and Greek satir­i­cal art, the ani­mals may rep­re­sent sup­posed arche­typ­al aspects of the artists and trades­men shown here. All very inter­est­ing, but of course the real inter­est in Papyrus Turin 55001 is of the pruri­ent vari­ety.\nEgyp­tol­ogy stu­dent Car­o­line Sea­wright points us toward the rather lurid His­to­ry Chan­nel seg­ment on the erot­ic papyrus, which calls the pic­tures “one of the most shock­ing sets of images in the whole of antiq­ui­ty.” Against a per­cep­tion of ancient Egyp­tians as “but­toned-up and repressed,” the video, and Sea­wright, detail the ways in which the cul­ture rev­eled in a styl­ized rit­u­al sex­u­al­i­ty quite dif­fer­ent from our own lim­it­ed mores.\nSacred tem­ple pros­ti­tutes held a priv­i­leged posi­tion and mytho­log­i­cal nar­ra­tives incor­po­rat­ed unbi­ased descrip­tions of homo­sex­u­al­i­ty and trans­gen­derism. Ancient Egyp­tians even expect­ed to have sex after death, attach­ing fab­ri­cat­ed organs to their mum­mies. The above applies main­ly to a cer­tain class of Egypt­ian. As archae­ol­o­gist David O’Connor points out, the Turin Erot­ic Papyrus’ high “artis­tic mer­it” marks it as with­in the prove­nance of “an elite own­er and audi­ence.” You can find more detailed images from a dif­fer­ent recon­struc­tion of the erot­ic papyrus here.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAn Ancient Egypt­ian Home­work Assign­ment from 1800 Years Ago: Some Things Are Tru­ly Time­less\n3,200-Year-Old Egypt­ian Tablet Records Excus­es for Why Peo­ple Missed Work: “The Scor­pi­on Bit Him,” “Brew­ing Beer” & More\nSex and Alco­hol in Medieval Times: A Look into the Plea­sures of the Mid­dle Ages\nSci­en­tists Dis­cov­er that Ancient Egyp­tians Drank Hal­lu­cino­genic Cock­tails from 2,300 Year-Old Mug\n\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin History, Literature, Technology |   \tDecember 2nd, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nMark Twain was, in the esti­ma­tion of many, the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca’s first tru­ly home­grown man of let­ters. And in keep­ing with what would be rec­og­nized as the can-do Amer­i­can spir­it, he could­n’t resist putting him­self forth now and again as a man of sci­ence — or, more prac­ti­cal­ly, a man of tech­nol­o­gy. Here on Open Cul­ture, we’ve pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured his patent­ed inven­tions (includ­ing a bet­ter bra strap), the type­writer of which he made pio­neer­ing use to write a book, and even the inter­net-pre­dict­ing sto­ry he wrote in 1898. Giv­en Twain’s incli­na­tions, his fame, and the time in which he lived, it may come as no sur­prise to hear that he also struck up a friend­ship with the much-roman­ti­cized inven­tor Niko­la Tes­la.\nAs it hap­pens, Tes­la had become a fan of Twain’s long before they met, hav­ing found solace in the Amer­i­can writer’s books pro­vid­ed dur­ing a long, near-fatal stretch of child­hood ill­ness. He cred­its his recov­ery with the laugh­ter that read­ing mate­r­i­al pro­vid­ed him, and one imag­ines see­ing life in the U.S. through Twain’s eyes played some part in his even­tu­al emi­gra­tion there.\nBy that point, Twain him­self was liv­ing in Europe, though his fre­quent vis­its to New York meant that he could drop by Tes­la’s lab and see how his lat­est exper­i­ments with elec­tric­i­ty were going. It was there, in 1894, that the two men took the pho­to­graph above, in which Twain holds a vac­u­um lamp engi­neered by Tes­la and pow­ered (out of frame) by the elec­tro­mag­net­ic coil that bears his name.\nAs Ian Har­vey writes at The Vin­tage News, “Tes­la was a sci­en­tist whose work large­ly revolved around elec­tric­i­ty; at that time, mak­ing your liv­ing as a sci­en­tist and inven­tor could often mean hav­ing to be some­what of a show­man,” a pres­sure Twain under­stood. His­to­ry has record­ed that Tes­la pro­vid­ed Twain with — in addi­tion to an elec­tric­i­ty-based con­sti­pa­tion cure that worked rather too well — advice against putting his mon­ey into an uncom­pet­i­tive auto­mat­ic type­set­ting machine that, unfor­tu­nate­ly, went unheed­ed. The one­time river­boat cap­tain went on to make an even more unsound invest­ment in a pow­der called Plas­mon, which promised to end world hunger. Per­haps Tes­la’s spir­i­tu­al descen­dants are to be found in today’s Sil­i­con Val­ley, invent­ing the future; Mark Twain’s cer­tain­ly are, under­writ­ing any num­ber of far-fetched schemes, if with far less of a sense of humor.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMark Twain Plays With Elec­tric­i­ty in Niko­la Tesla’s Lab (Pho­to, 1894)\nMark Twain Wrote the First Book Ever Writ­ten With a Type­writer\nMark Twain’s Patent­ed Inven­tions for Bra Straps and Oth­er Every­day Items\nMark Twain Pre­dicts the Inter­net in 1898: Read His Sci-Fi Crime Sto­ry, “From The ‘Lon­don Times’ in 1904”\nNiko­la Tesla’s Pre­dic­tions for the 21st Cen­tu­ry: The Rise of Smart Phones & Wire­less, The Demise of Cof­fee & More (1926/35)\nWhen David Bowie Became Niko­la Tes­la: Watch His Elec­tric Per­for­mance in The Pres­tige (2006)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nTaken from a vertical perspective, Kevin Krautgartner’s photographs of crashing waves conjure the power and beauty of our oceans. Captured along the coast of Western Australia, the images revel in the clarity and textures of the water and shoreline, where “wind, swell, and underwater topography creates some of the most powerful and visually striking wave formations I’ve ever encountered,” he says.\nKrautgartner’s latest series is titled Waves | Ocean Forces. Turquoise water swirls, sprays, rolls, and washes over the sand, focused so specifically that the phenomenon appears nearly abstracted. The artist spends time planning and waiting for ideal weather conditions and swells in order to snap the high-resolution images, some of which he plans to transform into large-format prints. \n\nWhile taking an analytical approach to waves, considering their physical properties and geologic impact, Krautgartner is also interested evoking our emotional connection to the ocean. “Waves have always fascinated me—not just as shapes, but as fleeting configurations of energy shaped by global and local forces,” he says. “What drew me to Western Australia was the possibility to witness this process at its most intense and most precise.”\nKrautgartner’s work is currently on view through the end of January with Livia Lisboa Fotokunst in Hamburg, and he’s prepping for another solo exhibition in 2026. Find more on Behance, Instagram, and his website, where you can purchase prints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nSince time immemorial, humans have sculpted sacred symbols into stone or formed them from clay. Expressing beliefs, worldviews, and spirituality in physical objects like votives and shrines is a way to imbue power and venerate deities and the natural world. For artists Chenlu Hou and Chiara No, ceramics is an enduring conduit to explore spirituality and storytelling.\nHou and No’s work will be exhibited together in a duo exhibition titled What the Hands Remember to Hear, which opens next month at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. The artists showcase objects that take on a sacred quality, emphasizing ceremony and customs while considering how cultures change and merge over time.\nChiara No, “Votive of Frimoth” (2024), underglaze on stoneware, 23kt gold leaf, 24kt gold-plated rings, and waxed thread, 5 x 5.5 x 9.5 inches\nHou’s colorful sculptures draw on her Chinese heritage, “blending folklore, remembrance, and the layered experiences of diaspora and cultural hybridity,” the museum says. “Chiara No creates chiming bells that personify idols, demons, and goddesses inspired by ancient, pagan, and Christian mythologies.” And for No, characterful sculptures embody myth and allegory, influenced by terracotta figures from ancient Boeotia, a region of south-central Greece.\nPlayful—slightly cartoonish, even—Hou and No’s sculptures are contemporary gestures of time-honored beliefs and cultural traditions. Both artists incorporate painting into their works, with tiny tableaux enriching the surfaces.\nFor example, Hou’s “Tian Gou Shi Ri – The truth about solar eclipse and how to observe it using pinhole imaging principle” depicts a giant female dog biting the sun with an image of a woman holding up a large object shaped like an eye—perhaps a viewing device—on its front leg. The piece draws on the Chinese legend of tiangou, or “heavenly dog,” which is said to eat the sun or moon during an eclipse.\nNo’s figures focus on mythological beings often vilified in literature that she researched across a range of historical time periods and media, including medieval folklore, Renaissance prose, and Elizabethan grimoires. Her pieces take the form of bells, with each figure’s legs dangling like a pair of clappers—a clapper is the “tongue” inside a bell that hits the edges to produce sound—so when activated, each sculpture creates a distinctive tone.\nChenlu Hou, “Tian Gou Shi Ri – The truth about solar eclipse and how to observe it using pinhole imaging principle” (2024), terracotta, underglaze, zip-ties, and high-temp wire hooks (slab hand-built, air-brushed surface with underglaze), 20 x 6 x 25 inches\nHou and No’s works “resonate with themes of transformation and cultural inheritance through reimagined storytelling,” the museum says. “Their shared attention to material and mythology invites viewers into a space where living, ever-evolving storylines mirror our collective present.”\nWhat the Hands Remember to Hear runs from January 26 through May 25 in Ridgefield, Connecticut. \nChiara No, “Votive to Ischiron” (2024), underglaze on stoneware and waxed thread, 6 x 4 x 6 inches\nChenlu Hou, “Four long-haired people ride a pomegranate-shaped mini-spaceship into space to smell armpit odor” (2025), terracotta, underglaze, zip-ties, high-temp wire hooks, rope, and gold ink (slab hand-built, air-brushed surface with underglaze), 29 x 19 x 10 inches\nChiara No. L-R: “Idol to Kobal” (2024), underglaze on stoneware, waxed thread, and recycled glass  beads, 6 x 7 x 8 inches; “Votive to Klothod” (2024), underglaze on stoneware and waxed thread, 9.5 x 6 x 10 inches; “Votive to Gemory” (2024), underglaze on  stoneware and waxed  thread, 4.5 x 6.5 x 5.5 inches.

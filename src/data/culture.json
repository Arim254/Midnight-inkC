    "body": "\n\tin Film, History, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough his movies may have ben­e­fit­ed great­ly from for­eign audi­ences and back­ers, David Lynch was one of the most thor­ough­ly Amer­i­can of all film­mak­ers. “Born Mis­soula, MT,” declared his Twit­ter bio, yet one nev­er real­ly asso­ciates him with a par­tic­u­lar place in the Unit­ed States (at least no extant one). From Mon­tana, the Lynch fam­i­ly moved to Ida­ho, then Wash­ing­ton, then North Car­oli­na, then Vir­ginia. The tim­ing of that last stint proved cul­tur­al­ly for­tu­itous indeed: liv­ing in the city of Alexan­dria, the eigh­teen-year-old Lynch was close enough to the nation’s cap­i­tal to attend the very first con­cert the Bea­t­les played in North Amer­i­ca, at the Wash­ing­ton Col­i­se­um on Feb­ru­ary 11, 1964.\n“I was into rock and roll music, main­ly Elvis Pres­ley.” Lynch recalls this unsur­pris­ing fact in the clip above (which would have been among the last inter­views he gave before his death a year ago) from Bea­t­les ’64, the Mar­tin Scors­ese-pro­duced doc­u­men­tary on the Fab Four’s first U.S. tour.\n“I didn’t have any idea how big this event was. And it was in a gigan­tic place where they had box­ing match­es. The Bea­t­les were in the box­ing ring. It was so loud, you can’t believe. Girls shud­der­ing, cry­ing, scream­ing their heart out. It was phe­nom­e­nal.” That deaf­en­ing crowd noise fig­ures into most every account of the group’s Beat­le­ma­nia-era shows — and played a deci­sive role in their per­ma­nent retreat into the stu­dio a cou­ple of years lat­er.\nLynch sure­ly would have under­stood the desire for artis­tic explo­ration and con­trol that drove the Bea­t­les’ con­cen­tra­tion on mak­ing records. Even the sen­si­bil­i­ties of his work and theirs had some­thing in com­mon, exhibit­ing as they both did the unlike­ly com­bi­na­tion of pop­u­lar­i­ty and exper­i­men­ta­tion.  Some­how, David Lynch’s films and the Bea­t­les’ albums could ven­ture into bewil­der­ing obscu­ri­ty and sen­ti­men­tal kitsch with­out los­ing coher­ence or crit­i­cal respect. And dare one imag­ine that the expe­ri­ence of wit­ness­ing the Amer­i­can debut of what would become the most influ­en­tial rock band of all time has giv­en Lynch his appre­ci­a­tion — evi­dent in his movies, but also his own record­ings — for the pow­er of music, which he calls “one of the most fan­tas­tic things”? Even if not, it must have been, well… sur­re­al.\n\n\n\t\n\nvia Wel­come to Twin Peaks\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nAnge­lo Badala­men­ti Reveals How He and David Lynch Com­posed the Twin Peaks’ “Love Theme”\nWhen the Bea­t­les Refused to Play Before Seg­re­gat­ed Audi­ences on Their First U.S. Tour (1964)\nDavid Lynch Directs a New Music Video for Dono­van\nWatch the Bea­t­les Per­form Their Famous Rooftop Con­cert: It Hap­pened 50 Years Ago Today (Jan­u­ary 30, 1969)\nDavid Lynch Talks Med­i­ta­tion with Paul McCart­ney\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Life, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen the his­to­ry books are writ­ten, we’ll remem­ber the politi­cians, law firms, and CEOs who quick­ly bent the knee to Don­ald Trump. We’ll also remem­ber the scant few Amer­i­can fig­ures who refused to back down. Bruce Spring­steen will be high on that short list.\nTour­ing in Europe last sum­mer, Spring­steen warned his audi­ence: “The Amer­i­ca that I love, the Amer­i­ca I have writ­ten about, that has been a bea­con of hope and lib­er­ty for 250 years, is cur­rent­ly in the hands of a cor­rupt, incom­pe­tent and trea­so­nous admin­is­tra­tion.” Those words seem par­tic­u­lar­ly pre­scient giv­en the chaos and vio­lence now unfold­ing in Min­neso­ta.\nFol­low­ing the shoot­ings of Renee Good and Alex Pret­ti, Spring­steen made his voice heard again—this time through music. Last week, he released the protest song “Streets of Min­neapo­lis” and soon after­ward trav­eled to Min­neso­ta to per­form the song live at a ben­e­fit con­cert arranged by Tom Morel­lo. Speak­ing to the crowd, Spring­steen said, “I wrote Streets of Min­neapo­lis and record­ed it the next day.” When he won­dered if the song sound­ed too ‘soap­boxy,’ he turned to Morel­lo, and the Rage Against the Machine gui­tarist replied, “Bruce, nuance is won­der­ful, but some­times you need to kick them in the teeth.” We’ll say amen to that.\nAfter “Streets of Min­neapo­lis,” Spring­steen and Morel­lo per­formed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” Watch it above. The start of the show began with “Killing In The Name Of.” Catch it below.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\nScott Gal­loway Unveils “Resist and Unsub­scribe,” an Action Plan for Con­sumers to Push Back Against Gov­ern­ment Over­reach\nTom Morel­lo Responds to Angry Fans Who Sud­den­ly Real­ize That Rage Against the Machine’s Music Is Polit­i­cal: “What Music of Mine DIDN’T Con­tain Polit­i­cal BS?”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Economics |   \tFebruary 1st, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs men­tioned here last week, Scott Gal­loway argued that Amer­i­cans have one way to reverse the vio­lent over­reach of the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment: launch a one-month eco­nom­ic strike aimed at major tech and AI com­pa­nies, with the goal of reduc­ing Amer­i­ca’s GDP and mak­ing the mar­kets wob­ble. When the mar­kets gyrat­ed after “Lib­er­a­tion Day,” Pres­i­dent Trump imme­di­ate­ly rolled back many tar­iffs. Now, if Amer­i­cans can flex their eco­nom­ic mus­cles in Feb­ru­ary, Gal­loway wagers the admin­is­tra­tion will rethink whether it wants to keep arrest­ing jour­nal­ists and let­ting masked ICE agents shoot civil­ians in the streets—with impuni­ty.\nToday, Gal­loway has launched a new web­site, Resist and Unsub­scribe, that pro­vides an action plan for a month­long strike. In the “Ground Zero” sec­tion of the site, Gal­loway lists sub­scrip­tion ser­vices from America’s largest tech­nol­o­gy companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple, Net­flix, Ope­nAI, and Microsoft—and pro­vides links that let users unsub­scribe quick­ly. He also sug­gests hold­ing off on buy­ing new hard­ware and prod­ucts from these com­pa­nies (e.g. iPhones). If you use Feb­ru­ary to review your sub­scrip­tions and find ones to cut, you’ll clean up your per­son­al finances. You’ll also get the atten­tion of the major tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies that account for one-third of the S&P 500. When the tech CEOs get “yip­py,” so too will Trump.\nIn the “Blast Zone” sec­tion of Resist and Unsub­scribe, Gal­loway lists consumer‑facing com­pa­nies he has “iden­ti­fied as active enablers of ICE,” nam­ing AT&T, Com­cast, Lowe’s, Mar­riott, and Spo­ti­fy among oth­ers. He explains how these com­pa­nies sup­port ICE and rec­om­mends spe­cif­ic ser­vices you can can­cel or avoid. Scroll down the page to see these sug­ges­tions.\nVis­it Resist and Unsub­scribe, find some ser­vices to can­cel (it’s not a large sac­ri­fice), and spread the word. You can also find more infor­ma­tion about the Resist and Unsub­scribe move­ment on Gal­loway’s blog, “No Mercy/No Mal­ice.”\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nScott Gal­loway Explains How YOU Can Stop Gov­ern­ment Over­reach Using the Pow­er of Your Purse\nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\n\t\t\n        \t",

And how is solidarity practiced on the day after?Two stories in today's newsletter prompt readers to ask difficult questions. The first is an in-depth report about tensions between art galleries and street vendors in a Manhattan art hub. The other is artist Damien Davis's opinion piece about the art world's performative allyship.

(photo Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)Tribeca Galleries Discuss Reporting Street Vendors, Drawing CriticismA group of galleries in Tribeca met in January to discuss “issues of safety and accessibility” related to street vendor presence on and near Broadway, raising concerns among activists who say these sellers — many of them immigrants — are already under threat from local and federal officials. Staff Writer Isa Farfan spoke with street vendor advocates and local galleries for this deeply reported story, which illuminates the need for more education and information when it comes to the most vulnerable members of our community.After the Strike, Will Art Galleries Be Allies?Remember the black squares of 2020, shared on social media as a gesture of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement? Recent posts from arts organizations loudly announcing their participation in Friday's anti-ICE strike reminded Damien Davis of these and other often “frictionless” acts of allyship. In a much-needed opinion, he asks: “Will anything still be different after the news cycle passes and the next show opens?” \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Onassis AiR Opens Applications for 2026–27 Residencies in AthensParticipants receive an artist’s fee, a research budget, housing, round-trip travel, mentoring, and other resources to support their work.\n                        \n                        \n                            Learn more\n                        \n                    \n            From Our Critics Eugène Atget, \"École des Beaux-Arts, Monument Henri Regnault\" (1903) (photo courtesy the International Center of Photography)Eugène Atget, Readymade IconAn exhibition retells the story of his discovery by Berenice Abbott, leaving out the details of a life defined by failure. | Julia CurlJames Castle Was a World Unto HimselfThese works feel almost metaphysically transportive — like a universe bound by a different set of rules that’s a pleasure to explore. | Lisa Yin ZhangClaude Cahun’s Survival Guide for the AgesA new translation of the French artist’s 1930 memoir is a kaleidoscopic collection of dialogues, sketches, and Blakean proverbs. | Joyelle McSweeney\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Explore Low and Full Residency MFA Options at Maine College of Art & DesignBuilt on a commitment to one-on-one mentoring, the MFA in Studio Art offers an interdisciplinary approach that inspires students to think across traditional academic boundaries.\n                        \n                        \n                            Learn more\n                        \n                    \n            Sandy Sanders on Valentina Di Liscia's “Another NFT Platform Bites the Dust”:Worthless is as worthless does.

    "body": "\n\tThe latest batch of documents released by the Department of Justice as part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act includes references to two leading art collectors, Steve Tisch and Jean Pigozzi. The DOJ’s library of documents have been added to over the past several days, with the latest update occurring on Saturday, January 31.\n\n\tThe documents, primarily in the form of emails sent around 2013, appear to show convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein connecting Tisch, a film producer and co-owner of the New York Giants, with multiple women. The news was first reported on by the Athletic.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tIn one email chain, from April 2013, which has the subject line “Ukrainian Girl,” Tisch asks Epstein if he knows any information about his “assistant’s friend,” who he recently had lunch with. Epstein replied that he “will get all the info,” with Tisch later saying “pro or civilian?” Epstein replies at one point, “civilian, but Russian, and rarely tells the full truth, but fun.”\n\n\tIn a different set of emails, from May 1, 2013, Tisch and Epstein correspond about meeting up that evening. At one point, Tisch writes, “Can I expect ‘trouble’?” Epstein replies, “I can invite the russian [redacted] to meet if you like?” Tisch writes back, “Is she fun?” Later in the chain, Epstein writes, “she is free after 1030 she said, you can meet her, you can come over first.”\n\n\tIn an email chain from May 15–16, 2013, Tisch asks a woman whose name has been redacted if she would be interested in meeting in Boston. Tisch doesn’t receive a reply and forwards the correspondence to Epstein, who replies, “she is traveling. not sure when she returns to florida. she is a micro biology major and is still in university, so i doubt that she could travel during the week, but we’ll see. you should also make it clear that you will orgaznie her ticket.” Tisch later writes back, “Never heard back from her / Oh well…”\n\n\tIn a 2017 email chain, Tisch writes to Epstein, asking how he is and that he hopes Epstein is “having a great Summer.” Epstein replied, “Come visit.” Other documents point to Tisch inviting Epstein to Giants games as well as other meetings over meals.\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement sent to the Athletic about his affiliations with Epstein, Tisch said, “We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.”\n\n\tTisch is also a major collector of contemporary art, having appeared on ARTnews’s Top 200 Collectors list from 2016 to 2024. A 2016 New York Times article revealed that he had created a 4,5000-square-foot private museum to host his collection in the backyard of his Los Angeles home. Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where Tisch is a trustee, curated the initial hang. In 2011, he also donated funds to help LACMA acquire Christian Marclay’s 24-hour video work The Clock (2010).\n\n\tPigozzi’s connections to Epstein are currently circulating online via a 2009 email between Epstein and publicist Peggy Siegal, in which Siegal writes, “Just left Ghislaine’s townhouse…after party for film.  Bill Clinton and Jeff Bezos were there…Jean Pigozzi, director Mira Nair…etc.”\n\n\tThe correspondence, also made in 2013, between Epstein and Pigozzi ranges from emails in which Pigozzi asks if Epstein is planning to visit the south of France that summer to emails where the discuss the appearance of different women. In the latter email chain, Pigozzi wrote, “I like the red head. Seem fun and smart.” Epstein replied, “german jew.” Pigozzi then replied, “I like her / No tits. Small problem / Did Leon like her ?” (Pigozzi appears to be referring to fellow art collector Leon Black, whose connections to Epstein have been well documented.)\n\t\n\n\tIn another email chain, Pigozzi responds to an email from Epstein in which he sent an image (the image is not reproduced in the file): “Looks amazing / Can’t see any girls ???”\n\n\tThe documents also include a 2010 email chain between Pigozzi and “Gmax,” most likely Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime associate who was convicted of child sex trafficking in 2021. “Gmax” asks Pigozzi if he is planning to sell his properties in Panama and France, adding “If so price. Have potential interested party”; Pigozzi asks for a phone call before writing that the France property is 22.5 acres and that it “MUST BE OVER EURO 300M,” while for the Panama property, his asking price would be “OVER $ 150 M  JUST THE ISLAND 270 ACRES.”\n\n\tIn a phone call, Pigozzi told ARTnews that he did not remember any correspondence between him and Epstein about a “red head.” Regarding the prices for his Panama and France properties, he said he was not interested in selling it at the time, adding “I gave him some ridiculous price.”\n\n\tOf his connections with Epstein, Pigozzi said, “I never had anything to do with him and girls. Zero. Nothing. I also regret that I met him and Ghislaine.”\n\n\tPigozzi told ARTnews that he found his work in the art world a more interesting topic of conversation than “these stupid emails. I don’t find it so fascinating.” Pigozzi is a major collector of African art, with a focus on photography from the continent. He first started collecting in 1989 after seeing the Centre Pompidou’s influential “Magiciens de la Terre” exhibition that year.\n\t\n\n\tIn the decades since, he has amassed thousands of works from more than 160 artists from 22 sub-Saharan African countries, according to the collection’s website. The collection is currently based in Geneva but does not have a permanent exhibition space, though he told ARTnews he is currently at work building a space in Cannes.\n\n\tIn 2019, Pigozzi donated 45 works of contemporary African art to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The gift included pieces by Seydou Keïta, Romuald Hazoumè, Bodys Isek Kingelez, Moké, Chéri Samba, Ambroise Ngaimoko/Studio 3Z, and Frédéric Bruly Bouabré. At the time, MoMA called the donation “transformative” as it would make the museum “a unique institutional leader in this aspect of contemporary African art.”\n\n\tPigozzi’s holdings include dozens of photographs by Keïta, many of which are currently on view in a survey of the late photographer’s work at the Brooklyn Museum. The Jean Pigozzi African Art Collection is specifically thanked in the exhibition’s credits.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) in New Delhi, one of India’s leading private art institutions, has announced the appointment of Manuel Rabaté as its first chief executive and director. The Frenchman joins from Louvre Abu Dhabi, where he has served as its inaugural director since the museum opened in 2016.Rabaté’s arrival comes as KNMA prepares for a major expansion that will see it move from its current location inside a shopping mall into a purpose-built museum complex near Indira Gandhi International Airport. Designed by David Adjaye Associates, the massive new campus is expected to open within the next three years, according to a museum spokesperson.Kiran Nadar, who founded KNMA in 2010 and is its chair, has described the upcoming complex as the largest museum and cultural center in South Asia. The site will include multiple exhibition galleries, performance and theater spaces, a library, archive, and education center.The New Delhi role will be Rabaté’s first at a private museum. Before taking the helm at Louvre Abu Dhabi, he led France Muséums, the French government-backed consultancy created to develop the museum.  It was founded in the wake of an intergovernmental agreement between France and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier in his career, Rabaté held senior positions at the Louvre and the Musée du Quai Branly–Jacques Chirac, both in Paris.\n\n\t“I have always had a keen interest in South Asia and in India in particular, both for its cultural richness and its institutional life,” Rabaté said in a statement. “I am excited to be part of a project that will change the museum landscape of the subcontinent.”\n\t\n\tAt KNMA, Rabaté will work alongside the museum’s existing leadership team, including chief curator Roobina Karode and Deepanjana Klein, director of acquisitions and development. According to the museum, his appointment is intended to bring global museum leadership to the institution as it scales up its operations while remaining regionally focused.\n\tDuring his tenure at Louvre Abu Dhabi, Rabaté oversaw the construction and launch of Jean Nouvel’s landmark building, expanded the museum’s permanent collection, developed its exhibition program, and helped establish a curatorial infrastructure in a region where such roles were previously limited.\n\tRabaté will step down from his role at Louvre Abu Dhabi on March 7 and is expected to take up his post in New Delhi in the first half of this year. In a statement, Louvre Abu Dhabi said a search for his successor is underway, adding that the institution “extends its gratitude to Manuel Rabaté for his extraordinary contribution and wishes him every success in his new role.”",

    "body": "\n\tPat Oleszko has been making a fool of herself full time for 60 years. Known for her satirical wit, surreal costumes, and performances in and around immense inflatables, the artist defies easy categorization. Using her body as the armature for a unique sort of walking, talking “pedestrian art,” Oleszko has inhabited incendiary and far-flung guises including a rapacious Coat of Arms(1972), a robed and miter-clad Nincompope (1999), and, in recent years, a caricature of Dumpty Trumpty (2018). For Oleszko, the performance never stops and the costume’s never off, whether on the street or onstage, nude or covered from head to toe.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe upstart Midwesterner spent her formative years in the 1960s at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, then a crucible of experimental time-based art. In that milieu, she brushed shoulders with Andy Warhol, listened to lectures by visitors from Claes Oldenburg to the Velvet Underground, and went to performances collectively staged by the ONCE Group, Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage, and Judson Dance Theater. Realizing that she could express her ideas in the way she presented herself in the everyday, her wardrobe exploded to fit all occasions, and she began making appearances at ONCE Group events and the Ann Arbor Film Festival. \n\n\tWhen Oleszko moved to New York in 1970, an art world gripped by Minimalism and Conceptual art didn’t quite know what to make of her subversive humor and ostentatious getups. She created her own opportunities to perform, walking city streets in absurd attire and infiltrating Thanksgiving and Easter Day parades. Before long, she got invitations to exhibit and perform at the Museum of Modern Art, the Kitchen, P.S. 122, and the Whitney Museum. \n\n\tNow, at the age of 78, Oleszko is being recognized by two New York bastions of contemporary art: the Whitney Biennial and SculptureCenter, the latter of which is presenting (through April 27) the artist’s first institutional solo exhibition in the city in more than 35 years. A.i.A. spoke with Oleszko about her multidisciplinary trajectory and flirtations with the absurd.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tView of Pat Oleszko’s 2026 exhibition “Fool Disclosure” at SculptureCenter, New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharles Benton\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYour practice originated in over-the-top costumes. How has it shifted scope and format over the years?\n\t\n\n\tIn the beginning, the costumes were a kind of octopussian exploration of anything that I found attractive, challenging, or comment-worthy. I was always wearing the inside of my head on the outside of my body. There was no name for performance art when I started working. There were artists doing events that responded to “happenings.” But I needed to discover what I was doing, using my body as the platform for experimentation. I did everything with my costumed personas. The world is my stage. The world is my stooge. \n\n\tI street-walked, joined protests and parades, attended parties. I did time-based events. I made performances on film. I entered a striptease contest and beauty contests like Miss Subways and Miss Polish America. I waitressed at Max’s Kansas City and the St. Adrian Company, and every night I costumed so that people would come in just to see who I was that evening. I also did burlesque, which was another means of discovering what to do with wearable sculptures—to take things off, put things on, become a character. At some point, I started using my works as illustrations, calling them “visual editorials.” Those have been in Artforum, Esquire, Ms., Oui, Penthouse, Playboy, and even Sesame Street Magazine and National Geographic. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko: Coat of Arms, 1973.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Neil Selkirk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIs there a medium you’ve come to identify with most strongly? \n\t\n\n\tThey’re meshed together in the great Osterizer in the sky. But I’m a sculptor, essentially, who makes work that lives, breathes, walks, farts, and fucks. My body is the expression of the initial idea. The work’s never separated from myself. I’m its vehicle. It was a big deal when I could finally let other people wear my costumes, which were so much a part of my journey of finding out who I was.\n\n\tHow did your disparate activities begin to cohere into longer performances?\n\n\tIn 1976, I had the opportunity to do an evening-length piece at the Museum of Modern Art. I had no idea how to do that at first, but I started stringing things together. The performances weren’t necessarily propelled by a storyline, but they focused on ideas that I’d hit at in lots of different ways. Once I could perform on a stage, I started to do shows at the Kitchen, P.S. 122, and places across Europe. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko: Patty Cake, 1972.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Neil Selkirk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat did you learn from your time working in burlesque?\n\n\tI did that off and on, so to speak, for a couple of years in college as “Pat, the Hippie Strippy.” It was an enormously informative and inspiring subculture that was on its way out—the last vestiges of vaudeville. They had comedians at the theater where I worked who would do acts with the girls, making all these double and triple entendres that I, of course, loved.\n\t\n\n\tDid that impact your pacing and sense of narrative? The multiact structure of your performances parallels that of vaudeville or variety shows.\n\n\tIn the variety show, there’s a new act every five minutes. I adopted that and manipulated it into my own thing. As the only person onstage, I’d multiply myself and turn different parts of my body—fingers, knees, butt, breasts, and pussy—into smaller characters.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko: Womb with a View, 1990.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tListening to an artist talk you gave in the ’80s, I was struck that it had the cadence of standup comedy. How did you arrive upon humor as a strategy? \n\n\tAs an artist, you’re compelled to work in ways both instinctive and intellectual. I have a definite theatrical bent, ranging from comedy to tragedy. My muse is a-muse. And I’m constantly amused by what the human animal does in pursuit of acceptance. The people I admire—Buster Keaton, Lewis Carroll, Jacques Tati—were brilliant at pointing out the foibles of society, the wonder of man as a barely thinking animal. That’s what propels me. I see inadequacies that I want to point out or correct. I do so through absurdity, which mostly happens to be funny, though sometimes it’s not. It’s a double whammy. You can laugh at something and then think, “Oh, jeez, what was I laughing at? She was talking about the end of the world.” \n\t\n\n\tYou’re like a court jester, given license to say bad things. \n\n\tYou get credibility if you’re a fool. You can say things, do things, manipulate things. I’m often making statements about topics that I want people to pay closer attention to—climate change, women’s rights, politics, and inequity and absurdity wherever I see it. \n\n\tYou’ve described your work as a kind of sociological experiment. You enter environments as a catalyzing event. How do people react? \n\n\tIt depends on the situation, the costume, and what level I’m operating on. Is it a critique or not? Sally Sex-retary (1971) can have 500 men following her down Wall Street in an absurd costume—you know, all tits and ass. Or I can walk out onto the street in my neighborhood and not get any response. There are some outfits that you can’t not look at. Every pair of eyeballs sees me, follows me from the minute I leave the house to the minute I escape. It’s very demanding to be the center of attention, with no place to hide. As the fool, I’ve taken it on as my burden. I’m not going out unless I’m ready to be a peacock, to complement the situation, to disturb things. \n\n\tMany of your installations and performances incorporate inflatables that you design and construct yourself—a Grecian temple, an astronaut, the legs and feet of the Wicked Witch of the West. What first gave you the idea to work with inflatables?\n\t\n\n\tI saw something that could blow up in a coffee shop and said, “Oh, I can make inflatable things, only I’ll make them a little larger than that.” It became a way for me to make big sculptures, which was one of the problems that I had been trying to solve by using my body as an armature. It took me a little while to figure out the air, the right fabric, and how I could actually use them in a performance. I began to inhabit them, using their interior and exterior spaces. They were great onstage. You could inflate one in a minute. It was this kind of surprise, or organic magic. Then you unzip it and boom, it’s gone. That’s one of the beauties of the inflatables—there’s no there there.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko as the Nincompope in the performance Roamin’ Holiday: A View from a Broad, 1999.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto  Craig Verzone\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow does it feel to have both a solo exhibition up at SculptureCenter and work in the Whitney Biennial?\n\n\tIn the Whitney Biennial, I’m showing a giant inflatable. I’m usually a pedestrian-size sculpture, but I just might have the tallest and smallest pieces in the show! The exhibition at SculptureCenter—“Fool Disclosure”—is a survey concentrating on the sculptural works. When they asked, I said, “I’m going to jam as many inflatables in as I can.” It expanded to include films, hats, and some of my really early works. There’s also a catalog, which includes more than 100 names that I came up with for the exhibition. My partner suggested “Pat Oleszko: Nice Hair.” I’ve been telling everybody—everybody!—that I’m going to be in two institutions at the same time. Someone worried, “She’s institutionalized in two places?!”\n\t\n\n\tThat’s also a good title. “Pat Oleszko: Institutionalized.”\n\n\tI’ll add it to the list. \n",

    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tJanuary 20th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough it’s eas­i­ly for­got­ten in our age of air trav­el and instan­ta­neous glob­al com­mu­ni­ca­tion, many a great city is locat­ed where it is because of a riv­er. That holds true every­where from Lon­don to Buenos Aires to Tokyo to New York — and even to Los Ange­les, despite its own once-uncon­trol­lable riv­er hav­ing long since been turned into a much-ridiculed con­crete drainage chan­nel. But no urban water­way has been quite so roman­ti­cized for quite so long as the Seine, which runs through the mid­dle of Paris. And it was in the mid­dle of the Seine, on the now-apt­ly named Île de la Cité, that Paris began. In the 3D time-lapse video above, you can wit­ness the near­ly two-and-a-half-mil­len­ni­um evo­lu­tion of that tiny set­tle­ment into the cap­i­tal we know today in just three min­utes.\nParis did­n’t take its shape in a sim­ple process of out­ward growth. As is vis­i­ble from high above through the video’s ani­ma­tion, the city has grown dif­fer­ent­ly in each era of its exis­tence, whether it be that of the Parisii, the tribe from whom it takes its name; of the Roman Empire, which con­struct­ed the stan­dard Car­do Max­imus (now known as the Rue Saint-Jacques) and Decumanus Max­imus, among much oth­er infra­struc­ture; the Mid­dle Ages, amid whose great (and hap­haz­ard) den­si­fi­ca­tion rose Notre-Dame de Paris; or the time of Baron Hauss­mann, whose rad­i­cal urban ren­o­va­tions laid waste to great swathes of medieval Paris and replaced them with the broad avenues, state­ly res­i­den­tial build­ings, and grand mon­u­ments rec­og­nized around the world today.\nAt first glance, the built envi­ron­ment of mod­ern Paris can seem to have been frozen in Hauss­man­n’s mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry — and no doubt, that’s just the way its count­less many tourists might want it. But as shown in the video, the Ville Lumière has kept chang­ing through­out the indus­tri­al era, and has­n’t stopped in the suc­ceed­ing “glob­al­iza­tion era.” More growth and trans­for­ma­tion has late­ly tak­en place out­side cen­tral Paris, beyond the encir­cling Boule­vard Périphérique, but it would hard­ly do jus­tice to his­to­ry to ignore such more rel­a­tive­ly recent, more divi­sive addi­tions as the Tour Mont­par­nasse, the Cen­tre Pom­pi­dou, or the Lou­vre Pyra­mid. (When it was built in the eigh­teen-eight­ies, even the beloved Eif­fel Tow­er drew a great deal of ire and dis­dain.) And though the ven­er­a­ble Notre-Dame may have stood on Île de la Cité since the four­teenth cen­tu­ry, the thor­ough­go­ing recon­struc­tion that fol­lowed its 2019 fire has made it belong just as much to the twen­ty-first. \nvia Kot­tke\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nA 3D Ani­mat­ed His­to­ry of Paris: Take a Visu­al Jour­ney from Ancient Times to 1900\nHow Paris Became Paris: The Sto­ry Behind Its Icon­ic Squares, Bridges, Mon­u­ments & Boule­vards\nA 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals What Paris Looked Like When It Was a Roman Town\nTake an Aer­i­al Tour of Medieval Paris\nThe Archi­tec­tur­al His­to­ry of the Lou­vre: 800 Years in Three Min­utes\nAn Ani­mat­ed His­to­ry of Ver­sailles: Six Min­utes of Ani­ma­tion Show the Con­struc­tion of the Grand Palace Over 400 Years\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nI have tak­en more out of alco­hol than alco­hol has tak­en out of me. — Win­ston Churchill\nWin­ston Churchill had a rep­u­ta­tion as a bril­liant states­man and a prodi­gious drinker.\nThe for­mer prime min­is­ter imbibed through­out the day, every day.  He also burned through 10 dai­ly cig­ars, and lived to the ripe old age of 90.\nHis come­back to Field Mar­shal Bernard Mont­gomery’s boast that he nei­ther smoked nor drank, and was 100 per­cent fit was “I drink and smoke, and I am 200 per­cent fit.”\nFirst Lady Eleanor Roo­sevelt mar­veled “that any­one could smoke so much and drink so much and keep per­fect­ly well.”\nIn No More Cham­pagne: Churchill and His Mon­ey, author David Lough doc­u­ments Churchill’s dis­as­trous alco­hol expens­es, as well as the bot­tle count at Chartwell, his Ken­tish res­i­dence. Here’s the tal­ly for March 24,1937:\n180 bot­tles and 30 half bot­tles of Pol Roger cham­pagne\n20 bot­tles and 9 half bot­tles of oth­er cham­pagne\n100+ bot­tles of claret\n117 bot­tles and 389 half bot­tles of Barsac\n13 bot­tles of brandy\n5 bot­tles of cham­pagne brandy\n7 bot­tles of liqueur whisky\n\nAll that liquor was not going to drink itself.\nDid Churchill have a hol­low leg?  An extra­or­di­nar­i­ly high tol­er­ance? An uncan­ny abil­i­ty to mask his intox­i­ca­tion?\nWhiskey som­me­li­er Rex Williams, a founder of the Whiskey Tribe YouTube chan­nel, and pod­cast host Andrew Heaton endeav­or to find out, above, by ded­i­cat­ing a day to the British Bulldog’s drink­ing reg­i­men.\nThey’re not the first to under­take such a fol­ly.\nThe Dai­ly Telegraph’s Har­ry Wal­lop doc­u­ment­ed a sim­i­lar adven­ture in 2015, wind­ing up queasy, and to judge by his 200 spelling mis­takes, cog­ni­tive­ly impaired.\nWilliams and Heaton’s on-cam­era exper­i­ment achieves a Drunk His­to­ry vibe and tell­tale flushed cheeks.\nHere’s the drill, not that we advise try­ing it at home:\nBREAKFAST\nAn eye open­er of John­nie Walk­er Red — just a splash — mixed with soda water to the rim.\nFol­low with more of the same through­out the morn­ing.\nThis is how Churchill, who often con­duct­ed his morn­ing busi­ness abed in a dress­ing gown, man­aged to aver­age between 1 — 3 ounces of alco­hol before lunch.\nAppar­ent­ly he devel­oped a taste for it as a young sol­dier post­ed in what is now Pak­istan, when Scotch not only improved the fla­vor of plain water, ‘once one got the knack of it, the very repul­sion from the fla­vor devel­oped an attrac­tion of its own.”\nAfter a morn­ing spent sip­ping the stuff, Heaton reports feel­ing “play­ful and jokey, but not yet vio­lent.”\nLUNCH\nTime for “an ambi­tious quo­ta of cham­pagne!”\nChurchill’s pre­ferred brand was Pol Roger, though he wasn’t averse to Giesler, Moet et Chan­don, or Pom­mery,  pur­chased from the upscale wine and spir­its mer­chant Ran­dolph Payne & Sons,  whose let­ter­head iden­ti­fied them as sup­pli­ers to “Her Majesty The Late Queen Vic­to­ria and to The Late King William The Fourth.”\nChurchill enjoyed his impe­r­i­al pint of cham­pagne from a sil­ver tankard, like a “prop­er Edwar­dian gent” accord­ing to his life­long friend, Odette Pol-Roger.\nWilliams and Heaton take theirs in flutes accom­pa­nied by fish sticks from the freez­er case. This is the point beyond which a hang­over is all but assured.\nLunch con­cludes with a post-pran­di­al cognac, to set­tle the stom­ach and begin the diges­tion process.\nChurchill, who declared him­self a man of sim­ple tastes — I am eas­i­ly sat­is­fied with the best — would have insist­ed on some­thing from the house of Hine.\nRESTORATIVE  AFTERNOON NAP\nThis seems to be a crit­i­cal ele­ment of Churchill’s alco­hol man­age­ment suc­cess. He fre­quent­ly allowed him­self as much as 90 min­utes to clear the cob­webs.\nA nap def­i­nite­ly pulls our re-enac­tors out of their tail spins. Heaton emerges ready to “bluff (his) way through a meet­ing.”\nTEATIME\nI guess we can call it that, giv­en the tim­ing.\nNo tea though.\nJust a steady stream of extreme­ly weak scotch and sodas to take the edge off of admin­is­tra­tive tasks.\nDINNER\nMore cham­pagne!!! More cognac!!!\n“This should be the apex of our wit,” a bleary Heaton tells his belch­ing com­pan­ion, who fess­es up to vom­it­ing upon wak­ing the next day.\nTheir con­clu­sion? Churchill’s reg­i­men is unmanageable…at least for them.\nAnd pos­si­bly also for Churchill.\nAs fel­low Scotch enthu­si­ast Christo­pher Hitchens revealed in a 2002 arti­cle in The Atlantic, some of Churchill’s most famous radio broad­casts, includ­ing his famous pledge to “fight on the beach­es” after the Mir­a­cle of Dunkirk, were voiced by a pinch hit­ter:\nNor­man Shel­ley, who played Win­nie-the-Pooh for the BBC’s Children’s Hour, ven­tril­o­quized Churchill for his­to­ry and fooled mil­lions of lis­ten­ers. Per­haps Churchill was too much inca­pac­i­tat­ed by drink to deliv­er the speech­es him­self.\nOr per­haps the great man mere­ly felt he’d earned the right to unwind with a glass of Graham’s Vin­tage Char­ac­ter Port, a Fine Old Amon­til­la­do Sher­ry or a Fine Old Liquor brandy, as was his wont.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nWin­ston Churchill Gets a Doctor’s Note to Drink Unlim­it­ed Alco­hol While Vis­it­ing the U.S. Dur­ing Pro­hi­bi­tion (1932)\nWin­ston Churchill’s Paint­ings: Great States­man, Sur­pris­ing­ly Good Artist\nOh My God!

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tJanuary 20th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nThe sto­ry, the many sto­ries, of Miles Davis as an open­ing act for sev­er­al rock bands in the 1970s makes for fas­ci­nat­ing read­ing. Before he blew the Grate­ful Dead’s minds as their open­ing act at the Fill­more West in April 1970 (hear both bands’ sets here), Davis and his all-star Quintet—billed as an “Extra Added Attraction”—did a cou­ple nights at the Fill­more East, open­ing for Neil Young and Crazy Horse and The Steve Miller Band in March of 1970. The com­bi­na­tion of Young and Davis actu­al­ly seems to have been rather unre­mark­able, but there is a lot to say about where the two artists were indi­vid­u­al­ly.\nNate Chi­nen in At Length describes their meet­ing as a “min­i­mum orbit inter­sec­tion distance”—the “clos­est point of con­tact between the paths of two orbit­ing sys­tems.” Both artists were “in the thrall of rein­ven­tion,” Young mov­ing away from the smooth­ness of CSNY and into free-form anti-vir­tu­os­i­ty with Crazy Horse; Davis toward vir­tu­os­i­ty turned back into the blues.\nMiles, sug­gest­ed jazz writer Greg Tate, was “bored fid­dling with quan­tum mechan­ics and just want­ed to play the blues again.” The sto­ry of Davis and Young at the Fill­more East is best told by lis­ten­ing to the music both were mak­ing at the time. Hear “Cin­na­mon Girl” below and the rest of Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s incred­i­ble set here. The band had just released their beau­ti­ful­ly ragged Every­body Knows this is Nowhere.\n\n\n\t\n\nWhen it comes to the meet­ing of Davis and Steve Miller, the sto­ry gets juici­er, and much more Miles: the dif­fi­cult per­former, not the impos­si­bly cool musi­cian. (It some­times seems like the word “dif­fi­cult” was invent­ed to describe Miles Davis.) The trum­peter’s well-earned ego­tism lends his lega­cy a kind of rak­ish charm, but I don’t rel­ish the posi­tions of those record com­pa­ny exec­u­tives and pro­mot­ers who had to wran­gle him, though many of them were less than charm­ing indi­vid­u­als them­selves. Colum­bia Records’ Clive Davis, who does not have a rep­u­ta­tion as a pushover, sounds alarmed in his rec­ol­lec­tion of Miles’ reac­tion after he forced the trum­peter to play the Fill­more dates to mar­ket psy­che­del­ic jazz-funk mas­ter­piece Bitch­es Brew to white audi­ences.\nAccord­ing to John Glatt, Davis remem­bers that Miles “went nuts. He told me he had no inter­est in play­ing for ‘those fu*king long-haired kids.’” Par­tic­u­lar­ly offend­ed by The Steve Miller Band, Davis refused to arrive on time to open for an artist he deemed “a sor­ry-ass cat,” forc­ing Miller to go on before him. “Steve Miller didn’t have his shit going for him,” remem­bers Davis in his exple­tive-filled auto­bi­og­ra­phy, “so I’m pissed because I got to open for this non-play­ing motherfu*ker just because he had one or two sor­ry-ass records out. So I would come late and he would have to go on first and then when we got there, we smoked the motherfu*king place, and every­body dug it.” There is no doubt Davis and Quin­tet smoked. Hear them do “Direc­tions” above from an Ear­ly Show on March 6, 1970.\n\n\n\t\n\n“Direc­tions,” from unre­leased tapes, is as raw as they come, “the inten­si­ty,” writes music blog Willard’s Worm­holes, “of a band that sounds like they were play­ing at The Fill­more to prove some­thing to some­body… and did.” The next night’s per­for­mances were released in 2001 as It’s About That Time. Hear the title track above from March 7th. You can also stream more on YouTube. As for The Steve Miller Blues Band? We have audio of their per­for­mance from that night as well. Hear it below. It’s inher­ent­ly an unfair com­par­i­son between the two bands, not least because of the vast dif­fer­ence in audio qual­i­ty. But as for whether or not they sound like “sor­ry-ass cats”… well, you decide.\n\n\n\t\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Night When Miles Davis Opened for the Grate­ful Dead in 1970: Hear the Com­plete Record­ings\nIn 1969 Telegram, Jimi Hen­drix Invites Paul McCart­ney to Join a Super Group with Miles Davis\nMiles Davis Plays Music from Kind of Blue Live in 1959, Intro­duc­ing a Com­plete­ly New Style of Jazz\nJer­ry Gar­cia Talks About the Birth of the Grate­ful Dead & Play­ing Kesey’s Acid Tests in New Ani­mat­ed Video\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, Technology |   \tJanuary 19th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen Net­flix launched around the turn of the mil­len­ni­um, it was received as a god­send by many Amer­i­can cinephiles, espe­cial­ly those who lived nowhere near diverse­ly pro­grammed revival hous­es or well-curat­ed video stores. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry lat­er, it’s safe to say that those days have come to an end. Not only does the stream­ing-only Net­flix of the twen­ty-twen­ties no longer trans­mit movies on DVD through the mail (a ser­vice its younger users have trou­ble even imag­in­ing), it ranks approx­i­mate­ly nowhere as a pre­ferred cinephile des­ti­na­tion. That has to do with a selec­tion much dimin­ished since the DVD days — espe­cial­ly as regards movies more than a decade or so old — but also with a brand debased by too many bland, for­mu­la­ic orig­i­nal pro­duc­tions.\nUnlike the plat­for­m’s var­i­ous acclaimed mul­ti-episode dra­mat­ic series, the “Net­flix movie” com­mands no crit­i­cal respect. But it can, at least if you trust the com­pa­ny’s own view­er­ship data, com­mand a large audi­ence, if not an espe­cial­ly atten­tive one. The gen­er­al semi-engage­ment of Net­flix view­ers, as argued in the Nerd­stal­gic video at the top of the post, is reflect­ed in the qual­i­ty of the “movie-shaped prod­uct” now served to them. \nFar from the slapped-togeth­er approx­i­ma­tions of Hol­ly­wood we once expect­ed from films made for TV, the stream-chart-top­ping likes of Red Notice and The Elec­tric State are mega-bud­get­ed pro­duc­tions brim­ming with big stars and large-scale visu­al effects. They’re also tis­sues of algo­rithm-approved nar­ra­tive ele­ments, bor­rowed imagery, and third-hand quips, all of them for­got­ten as soon as the next piece of con­tent begins auto-play­ing.\n\n\n\t\n\nOn the lat­est Joe Rogan Expe­ri­ence pod­cast, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon turned up to pro­mote their own Net­flix movie, The Rip. They don’t take long to open up about the dis­tinc­tive chal­lenges of work­ing for that plat­form in this era. Damon men­tions that, where­as action movies once saved their explo­sion-inten­sive set pieces for after the sto­ry gets in motion, Net­flix asks, “Can we get a big one in the first five min­utes? We want peo­ple to stay tuned in. And it wouldn’t be ter­ri­ble if you reit­er­at­ed the plot three or four times in the dia­logue because peo­ple are on their phones while they’re watch­ing.” Accord­ing to the film­mak­ers who speak about it, the needs of these so-called “sec­ond screen” view­ers have assumed great impor­tance in the stu­dio notes offered by Net­flix — which has, at this point, become a major stu­dio in itself.\n\n\n\t\n\nSat­is­fy­ing the appar­ent demands of Net­flix’s met­rics results in what Nerd­stal­gic calls “visu­al muzak,” geared to hold out just enough famil­iar­i­ty and pres­tige to get users to press play, with­out ever call­ing so much atten­tion to itself that they press stop. This makes the stu­dio pic­tures of the nineties, when Affleck and Damon broke out, look like the stuff of a gold­en age. “There were a lot of real­ly good inde­pen­dent movies that were being made,” Damon remem­bers. “They were mak­ing dar­ing movies, and every­one just got way more con­ser­v­a­tive.” On one lev­el, stream­ing plat­forms have great­ly widened access to film in gen­er­al; on anoth­er, they’ve sti­fled artis­tic indi­vid­u­al­i­ty and risk-tak­ing on the part of actu­al films. As Quentin Taran­ti­no has point­ed out, tech­nol­o­gy and eco­nom­ics put main­stream cin­e­ma into peri­ods of cre­ative retrench­ment every so often: the fifties, for exam­ple, or the eight­ies. Whether anoth­er sev­en­ties or nineties lies ahead, today’s cinephiles can only hope.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWho Is Killing Cin­e­ma?: A Mur­der Mys­tery Iden­ti­fies the Cul­tur­al & Eco­nom­ic Cul­prits\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Like Movies Any­more: The Rise of Meta­mod­ernist Films, and How They Grew Out of Mod­ernism & Post­mod­ernism\nHow the “Mar­veliza­tion” of Cin­e­ma Accel­er­ates the Decline of Film­mak­ing\nThe Decay of Cin­e­ma: Susan Son­tag, Mar­tin Scors­ese & Their Lamen­ta­tions on the Decline of Cin­e­ma Explored in a New Video Essay\nWhy We All Need Sub­ti­tles Now\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n            A group of artists, preservationists, and activists is sounding the alarm against Trump’s potential demolition of a prominent federal office building next to the National Mall, and the treasured artworks inside it — including several New Deal-era murals that speak to the value of Social Security in the United States.Alex Lawson, executive director of the advocacy organization Social Security Works, co-authored a petition to save the works with local muralist Absurdly Well. Released earlier this week, the missive demands that the Trump administration cease its plans to sell the Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building, described in the petition as the “Sistine Chapel of New Deal art.”In an interview with Hyperallergic, Lawson called Trump’s proposed transaction “authoritarianism 101.”“Erasing art culture and history is how authoritarians make it seem there’s nothing better than the thin gruel of cruelty they are offering,” Lawson said. “We couldn’t stop them from destroying the East Wing of the White House, but I pledge we’ll stop them from destroying the Wilbur Cohen building.”It would have been unthinkable merely a year ago that any president would willingly erase a visible symbol of America’s national heritage.The facade of the Cohen Federal Building in Washington, DC (photo Sabrina Davis/Social Security Works)But these are unprecedented times. After tearing down the East Wing to build a new ballroom without approvals from a national planning commission or Congress and affixing his name on the Kennedy Center, President Trump is seeking to liquidate four federal buildings by auctioning them to private developers.One of them is the Wilbur Cohen building, a block-long office on Independence Avenue that houses the headquarters of the Social Security Administration and Voice of America’s offices. The Charles Klauder-designed Egyptian Revivalist structure has been a historically designated landmark in Washington, DC, since 1978 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places nearly two decades ago.The building interiors, which feature works by Ben Shahn, Philip Guston, Seymour Fogel, and Ethel and Jenne Magafan, are also landmarked and arguably even more significant. The most famous of them is Shahn’s stark yet emotional fresco-secco “The Meaning of Social Security” (1942), depicting how the federal financial safety net lifted American families out of the poverty they endured during the Great Depression. Shahn once called the fresco, which he painted on dry plaster, “the best work I’ve done.”Main panel of Ben Shahn's \"The Meaning of Social Security\" (photo by Carol Highsmith via Library of Congress)Fogel’s works “Security of the People” (1942) and “Wealth of the Nation” (1942) show Americans raising their families and working in scientific labs and factories to build an equitable society in the 20th century. Preservationist Judy Chesser, head of the nonprofit land use and planning group Committee of 100 on the Federal City, said the works symbolized the importance of the American worker through history and would be “very difficult and expensive to remove.”“The art and architecture of these endangered properties manifest the good that happens when the government puts the American worker first, as it did when these were conceived in the Works Progress Administration,” Chesser said in a statement to Hyperallergic. That hasn’t stopped President Trump from razing historically prominent artworks. In 1979, the Trump Organization executive purchased the Bonwit Teller building on 5th Avenue and 56th Street for $15 million and promised to donate two limestone Art Deco friezes to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Instead, workers destroyed the panels while demolishing the building to make way for Trump Tower. Trump reportedly told the press at the time that the art had no intrinsic value.When the White House published a list of hundreds of federal properties across the country it sought to close down or potentially sell two months into Trump’s tenure, few in Washington took the downsizing seriously until bulldozers began dismantling the East Wing in October. Now Trump’s plan is clear. The General Services Administration (GSA), which owns and operates most of the nation’s federal office buildings, listed the Wilbur Cohen property as an asset for accelerated disposition last year for the purpose of selling it off to a private owner. The building has more than 1 million square feet of rentable office space, but a developer would more likely prefer to tear it down and build their own project, preservationists said.Detail of “Benefits of Social Security” (1941) by Henry Kreis (photo Sabrina Davis/Social Security Works)That revelation sparked fear among activists who have been mobilizing to defend the landmark. Lawson has been reaching out to his email list of 4 million Social Security recipients, whom he said overwhelmingly oppose such a move, while artists and preservationists, including FDR’s grandson Jim Roosevelt, have signed a letter to save the building.The GSA’s move even drew attention from Congress. Maine Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree, co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Arts Caucus, vowed to “fight this reckless plan and to protect our cultural institutions from this inconsiderate and destructive Administration.” “The building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, and its art belong to the American people and represent a unique era when our government recognized the importance of investing in public art and memorializing landmark legislative accomplishments like the Social Security Act,” Pingress said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “Demolition would be a devastating and irreversible loss.”Artist Absurdly Well, who co-authored the recent petition, said the Trump administration was seeking to erase the country’s memory and history as it seeks to dismantle the anti-poverty systems Americans have relied on for generations. “Artists everywhere should be enraged by this. That rage needs to go back into studios, apartments, and then back into the streets. We need art in public space that says: You do not get to erase this narrative,” he said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “This history matters.”\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Washington, DC\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        ",

While the curatorial team can’t be faulted for this, it remained fresh on my mind as I considered the powers we are beholden to in the United States. The exhibition begins unexpectedly with a small selection of landscapes on fire or caught in an impending storm — moments of chaos not typically associated with the famed centenarian artist whose work harkened back to rural, idyllic depictions of the US during an era of rapid modernization. The excitement these flames stirred in me was quickly extinguished by the exhibition’s safe presentation of Grandma Moses's work. Its main accomplishment is its scale, which allows visitors to enjoy an astounding quantity of this seminal artist’s oeuvre. But rather than presenting any novel or nuanced readings of the artist, or even justifying the exhibition’s evocative title, it lays out a thorough biography of the artist that is didactic as opposed to substantial.This lack of discursive rigor is disappointing, given that the exhibition catalog brims with wonderfully researched essays that complicate the scholarship on Moses. While it’s easy — and true — to point to Trump’s executive order “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” as the reason for this risk-averse approach, the discrepancy reveals a deeper issue: the costs of preserving the myths that embody US exceptionalism. Grandma Moses’s trajectory as arguably the most famous artist in the United States is certainly notable; however, her vast, complex body of work warrants more careful aesthetic critique. The seemingly benign narrative presented in the galleries must be deconstructed, as it also embodies detrimental values the United States holds.  Grandma Moses, \"Early Springtime on the Farm\" (1945), oil on high-density fiberboard Anna Mary Robertson Moses was born in 1860 in the farmland of Washington County, New York. She was briefly educated in a one-room schoolhouse and then sent to work full-time for a wealthy couple as a preteen. Through that difficult experience, Moses learned skills in domestic farm labor that she would carry to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley after marrying her husband, Thomas Salmon Moses, as they tried to make a fortune in the Reconstruction-era South. Although they founded a life there, having 10 children, 5 of whom survived to adulthood, Moses and her family eventually moved back to Upstate New York after 18 years in 1905, where they bought a small, successful farm. In 1938, Moses was discovered by Louis Caldor, an art collector who saw her paintings in a drugstore. She gradually entered the limelight, becoming an endearing figure who graced the cover of Time magazine and whose work was reproduced in memorabilia, making her a ubiquitous grandmother figure. While Moses’s age is often pointed out biographically in the show, it is never given credence as an artistic factor, despite its formal importance to her painting. In fact, it was the impetus for her artistic output, as she switched from crafting pictures out of yarn to painting because of rheumatoid arthritis. In her catalog essay, “Age, Race, and Memory,” Erika Doss articulates that the increase in life expectancy in the 20th century marginalized older Americans, leading to false perceptions that they were burdens on their families and society. Doss then frames Moses as the antithesis: a symbol of the strong, self-sufficient American spirit. Grandma Moses, \"White Birches\" (1961), oil on pressed woodMoses’s age manifests in ways that are never acknowledged in the exhibition, though. Made 16 years apart and displayed side-by-side, “Early Springtime on the Farm” (1945) and “White Birches” (1961) evidence the deterioration of the artist’s fine motor skills. The springtime scene, still covered in a blanket of snow, is made up of bold, controlled applications of paint, while the green, vivacious scene surrounding nine birches has a soft, splotchy, expressionistic quality that suggests a loss of technical dexterity. Rather than exploring the reality of old age changing our bodies, the show and catalog reinforce the notion of Moses as a figure who beat time. The artist still experienced the effects of aging, and the omission perpetuates the idea that any bodily flaws are a burden to society — a larger ableist tendency prevalent in the United States.The exclusive presence of White figures in Moses’s scenes on display is another issue that the exhibition skirts. The racial bias is especially evident when considering her depictions of Virginia, where she is known to have hired Black domestic and farm laborers for years. “Calhoun” (1955), for instance, depicts a beautiful brick farmhouse and surrounding fertile farmland happily tended by White workers, betraying the historical reality. The artist herself never publicly acknowledged this disparity, and although the show references the “predominantly light-skinned” subjects, that is the extent of its critical analysis. Several essays in the catalog do tackle the issue of the racial dynamics of land ownership in the South, yet the absence is glaring in the galleries. Grandma Moses, \"Calhoun\" (1955), oil on pressed woodIronically, race is also tied to the weakest part of Moses’s practice: painting figures. Moses’s amorphous people, with crude smiley-face lines as expression, often detract from her skillfully rendered, serene landscapes. The quality of Moses's work as a painter has always been central to the artist’s discourse: “Serious” formalist critics of the 20th century derided her work for perceived fluffiness and its inconsequentiality to Modernism, while populists believed her achievements to be extraordinary. Why can’t both be true? Many of Moses’s paintings are formally spectacular, but aesthetically unpleasant flaws plague others. Take “July Fourth” (1951), which shows a White community parading down a town’s main road, waving flags as a group of kids play baseball under another flag. The mass of figures amplifies how awkward the faces, with their black dots and lines, are. Both this and the nationalism are cloying, lacking the poise of Moses’s more sparse and contemplative scenes. Grandma Moses: A Good Day’s Work feels frozen in time. While the catalog does admirable heavy lifting, it’s a massive disservice to both a public familiar and unfamiliar with her rich history to offer a show with little new. The most unfortunate part of the show is that refusing to complicate her legacy actually flattens it. Instead, more profound truths can be uncovered within her work to debunk harmful mythologies endemic to the US, while still upholding the magnitude of Moses’s achievement as one of the most famous and delightful American artists.Grandma Moses: A Good Day’s Work continues at the Smithsonian American Art Museum (G Street Northwest & 8th Street Northwest, Washington, DC) through July 12. The exhibition travels to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, from September 12, 2026–March 29, 2027. It was organized by Leslie Umberger and Randall R. Griffey with Maria R. Eipert. \n                  \n                      \n                        Art Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Grandma Moses\n                      \n                      \n                        Smithsonian American Art Museum\n                      \n                      \n                        Washington DC\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

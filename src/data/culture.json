    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nHere’s anoth­er thing you can cred­it Thomas Jef­fer­son with: being the first known Amer­i­can to record an ice cream recipe. It’s one of 10 sur­viv­ing recipes writ­ten by the found­ing father.\nAccord­ing to Monticello.org, ice cream began appear­ing “in French cook­books start­ing in the late 17th cen­tu­ry, and in Eng­lish-lan­guage cook­books in the ear­ly 18th cen­tu­ry.” And there “are accounts of ice cream being served in the Amer­i­can colonies as ear­ly as 1744.” Jef­fer­son like­ly tast­ed his fair share of the dessert while liv­ing in France (1784–1789), and it con­tin­ued to be served at Mon­ti­cel­lo upon his return to Vir­ginia. By the first decade of the 19th cen­tu­ry, ice cream became increas­ing­ly com­mon in cook­books pub­lished through­out the U.S.\nYou can see the entire recipe for Jef­fer­son­’s vanil­la ice cream here, and read a tran­script below.\n2. bot­tles of good cream.\n6. yolks of eggs.\n1/2 lb. sug­ar\nmix the yolks & sug­ar\nput the cream on a fire in a casse­role, first putting in a stick of Vanil­la.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off & pour it gen­tly into the mix­ture of eggs & sug­ar.\nstir it well.\nput it on the fire again stir­ring it thor­ough­ly with a spoon to pre­vent it’s stick­ing to the casse­role.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off and strain it thro’ a tow­el.\nput it in the Sabottiere[12]\nthen set it in ice an hour before it is to be served. put into the ice a hand­ful of salt.\nput salt on the cov­er­lid of the Sabotiere & cov­er the whole with ice.\nleave it still half a quar­ter of an hour.\nthen turn the Sabot­tiere in the ice 10 min­utes\nopen it to loosen with a spat­u­la the ice from the inner sides of the Sabotiere.\nshut it & replace it in the ice\nopen it from time to time to detach the ice from the sides\nwhen well tak­en (prise) stir it well with the Spat­u­la.\nput it in moulds, justling it well down on the knee.\nthen put the mould into the same buck­et of ice.\nleave it there to the moment of serv­ing it.\nto with­draw it, immerse the mould in warm water, turn­ing it well till it will come out & turn it into a plate\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe First Amer­i­can Cook­book: Sam­ple Recipes from Amer­i­can Cook­ery (1796)\nLeo Tolstoy’s Fam­i­ly Recipe for Mac and Cheese\nErnest Hemingway’s Favorite Ham­burg­er Recipe\nThe Recipes of Icon­ic Authors: Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath, Roald Dahl, the Mar­quis de Sade & More\nMoMA’s Artists’ Cook­book (1978) Reveals the Meals of Sal­vador Dalí, Willem de Koon­ing, Andy Warhol, Louise Bour­geois & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nHow to Actu­al­ly Cook Sal­vador Dali’s Sur­re­al­ist Recipes: Cray­fish, Prawns, and Spit­ted Eggs\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Books |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImag­ine you could talk to Hierony­mus Bosch, the authors of the Book of Rev­e­la­tion, or of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script—a bizarre 15th cen­tu­ry text writ­ten in an uncrack­able code; that you could solve cen­turies-old mys­ter­ies by ask­ing them, “what were you think­ing?” You might be dis­ap­point­ed to hear them say, as does Lui­gi Ser­afi­ni, author and illus­tra­tor of the Codex Seraphini­anus, “At the end of the day [it’s] sim­i­lar to the Rorschach inkblot test. You see what you want to see. You might think it’s speak­ing to you, but it’s just your imag­i­na­tion.”\nIf you were a long­time devo­tee of an intense­ly sym­bol­ic, myth­ic text, you might refuse to believe this. It must mean some­thing, fans of the Codex have insist­ed since the book’s appear­ance in 1981.\nIt shares many sim­i­lar­i­ties with the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, save its rel­a­tive­ly recent vin­tage and liv­ing author: both the Seraphini­anus and the Voyn­ich seem to be com­pendi­ums of an oth­er­world­ly nat­ur­al sci­ence and art, and both are writ­ten in a whol­ly invent­ed lan­guage.\n\nSer­afi­ni tells Wired he thinks Voyn­ich is a fake. “The Holy Roman Emper­or Rudolf II loved ancient man­u­scripts; some­body swin­dled him and spread the rumor that it was orig­i­nal. The idea of made-up lan­guages is not new at all.” As for his own made-up lan­guage in the Codex, he avers, “I always said that there is no mean­ing behind the script; it’s just a game.” But it is not a hoax. Though he hasn’t mind­ed the mon­ey from the book’s cult pop­u­lar­i­ty, he cre­at­ed the book, he says, “try­ing to reach out to my fel­low peo­ple, just like blog­gers do.” It is, he says, “the prod­uct of a gen­er­a­tion that chose to con­nect and cre­ate a net­work, rather than kill each oth­er in wars like their fathers did.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe Codex, writes Abe Books, who made the short video review above, is “essen­tial­ly an ency­clo­pe­dia about an alien world that clear­ly reflects our own, each chap­ter appears to deal with key facets of this sur­re­al place, includ­ing flo­ra, fau­na, sci­ence, machines, games and archi­tec­ture.” That’s only a guess giv­en the unin­tel­li­gi­ble lan­guage.\nThe illus­tra­tions seem to draw from Bosch, Leonar­do da Vin­ci, and the medieval trav­el­ogue as much as from the sur­re­al­ism of con­tem­po­rary Euro­pean artists like Fan­tas­tic Plan­et ani­ma­tor René Laloux.\n\nSer­afi­ni has been delight­ed to see an exten­sive inter­net com­mu­ni­ty coa­lesce around the book, and has had his fun with it. He “now states,” writes Dan­ger­ous Minds, “that a stray white cat that joined him while he cre­at­ed the Codex in Rome in the 1970s was actu­al­ly the real author, tele­path­i­cal­ly guid­ing Ser­afi­ni as he drew and ‘wrote.’” You can now, thanks to a recent, rel­a­tive­ly afford­able edi­tion pub­lished by Riz­zoli, pur­chase your copy of the Codex. Buy now, I’d say. First edi­tions of the book now fetch upwards of $6000, and its pop­u­lar­i­ty shows no sign of slow­ing.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:  \nA Dig­i­tal Archive of Hierony­mus Bosch’s Com­plete Works: Zoom In & Explore His Sur­re­al Art\nExplore a Dig­i­tized Edi­tion of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, “the World’s Most Mys­te­ri­ous Book”\nCarl Jung’s Hand-Drawn, Rarely-Seen Man­u­script The Red Book\nThe Foot-Lick­ing Demons & Oth­er Strange Things in a 1921 Illus­trat­ed Man­u­script from Iran\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\nAll images courtesy of the artist, shared with permission\nFebruary 21, 2026\n\n\nFor Michael Pederson, happenstances of infrastructure, nature, and the urban landscape present endless opportunities for the imagination. His playful miniatures scale the stems of weeds, reimagine gaps in walls, and reinterpret coincidences. Tiny structures and signs draw our attention to marvels of nature, like the seven-centimeter-tall “Mount Paltry,” or invite viewers into mysterious realms beyond civilization. Tapping into everyday occurrences and impressions, Pederson transforms the mundane into moments of wonder and delight.\nIf you’re in Seoul, see Pederson’s work in the show Room for Wonder at Groundseesaw until June 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

Worth noting too is the story of The Aids Walk in Central Pk. For many years AIDS Walk organizers were kept out of the pk, yet after much effort by The Walk's leadership and the NYC Pks Office of Special Events the event was welcomed into the Great Lawn. This only happened once NYC transitioned mayors from Ed Koch to David Dinkins - and importantly once a new commissioner was appointed. Having been there I can remember the meeting when the newly appointed Pks Commissioner Betsy Gotbaum agreed with the events team to allow the AIDS Walk to use The Great Lawn - the crowned jewl of NYC event locations. At the time this decision was cause for celebration. The move exponentially increased attendance and allowed for truly substantial increase in revenue. At one point upwards of 30,000 gathered on the lawn for the AIDS Walk. In recent years pressure from private groups has pushed this and other events from the Great Lawn; yet the event remains in Central Pk Bandshell with reports of crowds of more than 45,000 at the event's peak.\n                            Wilmers Integrity PrizeThis annual award honors changemakers striving to better our world across a range of fields.

    "body": "\n\tJasmine Little, a Los Angeles–based painter who made lush still lifes and etched ceramic vessels dense with historical references, has died at 41. La Loma, her Los Angeles gallery, announced her death on Friday. No cause of death was provided.\n\n\tIn a statement, gallery owner Kirk Nelson, who worked with Little since 2019, described her as “a force of nature” and her work as “a reflection of  her essence–at times tender, at times emotional, often naughty, always curious, and filled with wonder, beauty, pain–the whole astonishing rainbow of feeling, being.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“Even though I worked alongside her for years, I don’t know how this young artist from Joshua Tree sgraﬀito’d mythologies onto stone as if she was beamed in from Pompeii A.D,” Nelson said. “She worked in divine, painful frenzies for days and weeks on end. Monuments emerged. Five-hundred-pound sculpture inlaid with obsessively, beautifully detailed linework and whole narratives. I was awed by her art and prodigy, but what I will miss most of all is our deep, silly friendship. Long conversations in her studio about the lonely, inspired life of artmaking.

    "body": "\n\tHundreds of artists, gallery owners, and collectors staged sit-ins last week in museums across Spain to draw attention to the country’s high cultural VAT.\n\n\tOver 100 demonstrators parked their backsides on the floor of Madrid’s Museo Reina Sofía in the room dedicated to the late American artist Richard Serra. They surrounded Equal-Parallel/Guernica-Bengasi, a replica of a sculpture that had disappeared from a storage facility sometime between 1990 and 2005. It consisted of four 38-ton steel blocks that vanished without a trace. According to El País, one demonstrator warned, “The sector is going to disappear just like this piece vanished.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe sit-in was part of ongoing efforts by the visual arts community to push the government to reduce the 21 percent VAT on cultural goods, a rate that has remained unchanged since 2012. Organizers pointed out that neighboring countries have significantly lower rates: Italy charges 5 percent, France 5.5 percent, Germany 7 percent, and Portugal 6 percent.\n\n\tDuring the protest, participants chanted the comparative VAT rates in unison and called on the government to act. “We are not a luxury industry… we are culture,” they said. They also demanded the resignation of Culture Minister Ernest Urtasun and Finance Minister María Jesús Montero, highlighting what they described as years of government silence on the issue.\n\n\tThe sit-in followed galleries across Spain closing on February 2 in a symbolic protest against the high VAT. This year’s action took place just weeks ahead of the 45th edition of ARCOmadrid, the country’s leading contemporary art fair. Organizers said that the 21 percent VAT puts Spanish galleries at a significant disadvantage compared with international competitors. For example, a €10,000 artwork sold in Paris would cost €12,100 including VAT, compared with €10,550 in France at 5.5 percent VAT—a difference that can determine whether a sale succeeds.\n\n\tIdoia Fernández, president of the Consortium of Contemporary Art Galleries of Spain, said the protest was about “asking for equality.” Protesters held banners reading, “We are not asking for privileges, we are asking for equality,” and emphasized, “There are no museums without art, nor a country without heritage.”\n\t\n\n\tSimilar demonstrations took place at the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo in Seville, the Institut Valencià d’Art Modern in Valencia, and the Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona.\n\n\tInside the Reina Sofía, the atmosphere ranged from frustration to fatigue, as visitors largely ignored the protest. Yet organizers said the urgency was clear: without a VAT reduction, Spain’s galleries risk losing ground to European competitors and jeopardizing the country’s cultural sector in the long term.\n\n\tAfter a decades-long pressure campaign by Italian galleries, artists, auction houses, and art market players, last year the Italian government announced it was cutting the country’s VAT on art sales to just 5 percent. It was previously 22 percent, the highest in the European Union. \n",

    "body": "\n\tin Education, Games |   \tJanuary 8th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs any new par­ent soon finds out, there exists a robust mar­ket for prod­ucts, ser­vices, and media that promise to boost a child’s intel­li­gence. Some of these offer­ings come as close as legal­ly pos­si­ble to hold­ing out the promise of putting any tot on the path to genius, brazen­ly beg­ging the ques­tion of whether it’s pos­si­ble to raise a genius in the first place. Still, the efforts par­ents have delib­er­ate­ly made in that direc­tion have occa­sion­al­ly pro­duced notable results, from epochal fig­ures like Mozart or John Stu­art Mill to the promis­ing-math­e­mati­cian-turned-street­car-trans­fer-obsessed-recluse William Sidis. More recent­ly came the Pol­gár sis­ters, who were suc­cess­ful­ly raised to become some of the great­est female chess play­ers in his­to­ry.\nHav­ing stud­ied the nature of intel­li­gence at uni­ver­si­ty, their father Lás­zló got it in his head that, since most genius­es start­ed learn­ing their sub­jects inten­sive­ly and ear­ly, par­ents could cul­ti­vate genius-lev­el per­for­mance in their chil­dren by direct­ing that learn­ing process them­selves. He sought out a wife both intel­lec­tu­al­ly promis­ing and will­ing to devote her­self to test­ing this hypoth­e­sis. Togeth­er they went on to father three daugh­ters, putting them through a rig­or­ous, cus­tom-made edu­ca­tion ori­ent­ed toward chess mas­tery. Chess became the pro­jec­t’s cen­tral sub­ject in large part because of its sheer objec­tiv­i­ty, all the bet­ter for Lás­zló Pol­gár to mea­sure the results of this domes­tic exper­i­ment.\nNor could it have hurt, giv­en the impor­tance of retain­ing the inter­est of chil­dren, that chess was a game — and one with evoca­tive toy-like pieces — that offers imme­di­ate feed­back and feel­ings of accom­plish­ment. For his daugh­ters, Pol­gár has empha­sized, learn­ing involved none of the drudgery and busy­work of school. “A child does not like only play: for them it is also enjoy­able to acquire infor­ma­tion and solve prob­lems,” he writes in his book Raise a Genius! “A child’s work can also be enjoy­able; so can learn­ing, if it is suf­fi­cient­ly moti­vat­ing, and if it means a con­stant sup­ply of prob­lems to solve that are appro­pri­ate for the lev­el of the child’s needs. A child does not need play sep­a­rate from work, but mean­ing­ful action.”\nThe proof of Pol­gár’s the­o­ries is in the pud­ding — or at any rate, in the rat­ings. All three of his daugh­ters became elite chess play­ers. Sofia, the mid­dle one, became the sixth-strongest female play­er in the world; Susan, the eldest, the top-ranked female play­er in the world; Judit, the youngest, the strongest female chess play­er of all time. This despite the fact that their father was an unex­cep­tion­al chess play­er, and their moth­er not a chess play­er at all. Some eager­ly take the sto­ry of the Pol­gár sis­ters as a vin­di­ca­tion of nur­ture over nature; oth­ers, sci­en­tif­ic researchers includ­ed, argue that it only shows that prac­tice is a nec­es­sary con­di­tion for this kind of genius, not a suf­fi­cient one. For my part, hav­ing kept an eye on a pair of infant twins while writ­ing this, I’d be hap­py if my own kids could just mas­ter hold­ing on to their bot­tles.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nLearn How to Play Chess Online: Free Chess Lessons for Begin­ners, Inter­me­di­ate Play­ers & Beyond\nMeet Alma Deutsch­er, the Clas­si­cal Music Prodi­gy: Watch Her Per­for­mances from Age 6 to 14\nThe Mag­ic of Chess: Kids Share Their Unin­hib­it­ed, Philo­soph­i­cal Insights about the Ben­e­fits of Chess\nHear the Pieces Mozart Com­posed When He Was Only 5 Years Old\nRead an 18th-Cen­tu­ry Eye­wit­ness Account of 8‑Year-Old Mozart’s Extra­or­di­nary Musi­cal Skills\nThe Renewed Pop­u­lar­i­ty of Chess and The Queen’s Gam­bit: Pret­ty Much Pop Cul­ture Pod­cast Dis­cus­sion #78 with Chess Expert J.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs much as it is about every part of Dublin that ever passed by James Joyce’s once-young eyes, Ulysses is also a book about books, and about writ­ing and speech—as myth­ic invo­ca­tion, as seduc­tion, chat­ter, and rhetoric, ful­some and emp­ty. Words—two-faced, like open books—carry with them at least two sens­es, the mean­ing of their present utter­ance, and the ver­so shades of his­to­ry. This is at least part­ly the import of Joyce’s myth­i­cal method, as it is that of all expos­i­tors of ancient texts, from preach­ers and the­olo­gians to lit­er­ary crit­ics. It seems par­tic­u­lar­ly sig­nif­i­cant, then, that the pas­sage Joyce chose for the one and only record­ing of a read­ing from Ulysses comes from the “Aeo­lus” episode, which par­o­dies Odysseus and his com­pan­ions’ encounter with the god of wind.\nJoyce sets the scene in the news­pa­per offices of the Freeman’s Jour­nal, epit­o­me of writ­ing in the present tense, where reporters and edi­tors give puffed-up speech­es punc­tu­at­ed by reduc­tive, pithy head­lines. Amidst this busi­ness, eru­dite pro­fes­sor MacHugh and Stephen Dedalus wax lit­er­ary and his­tor­i­cal, mak­ing con­nec­tions. MacHugh recites “the finest dis­play of ora­to­ry” he ever heard—a defense of the revival of the Irish lan­guage that com­pares the Irish peo­ple to Moses and the ancient Hebrews spurn­ing the seduc­tions of an oppres­sive empire in the per­son of an Egypt­ian high priest: Vagrants and day­labour­ers are you called: the world trem­bles at our name.\nJoyce record­ed the pas­sage in 1924 at the urg­ing of Shake­speare and Com­pa­ny founder Sylvia Beach, who per­suad­ed the HMV gramo­phone stu­dio in Paris to make the record, under the pro­vi­sion that she would finance it and that the studio’s name would appear nowhere on the prod­uct. Ulysses, recall, was in many places under a ban for obscen­i­ty (not lift­ed in the U.S. until 1933 by Judge John Woolsey). The record­ing ses­sion was painful for Joyce, who need­ed two attempts on two sep­a­rate days to com­plete it, plagued as he was by his fail­ing eyes. And yet Joyce, Beach wrote in her notes, “was anx­ious to have the record­ing made… He had made up his mind, he told me, that this would be his only read­ing from Ulysses… it is more, one feels, than mere ora­to­ry.” You can read the speech here while lis­ten­ing to Joyce read above. Beach called Joyce’s read­ing a “won­der­ful per­for­mance.” “I nev­er hear it,” she wrote, “with­out being deeply moved.”\n\n\n\t\n\nWhile Beach may have been sat­is­fied with the record­ing, her friend, lin­guist C.K. Ogden pro­nounced it “very bad,” mean­ing, writes Beach, “it was not a suc­cess tech­ni­cal­ly” (though it was not, in any case, “at all a com­mer­cial ven­ture”). You will notice this imme­di­ate­ly as you strug­gle to hear Joyce’s mut­ed read­ing. Anx­ious to pre­serve his voice in a clear­er doc­u­ment, Ogden cap­tured Joyce read­ing from Finnegans Wake five years lat­er at the stu­dio of the Ornitho­log­i­cal Soci­ety in Cam­bridge (he boast­ed of own­ing “the two biggest record­ing machines in the world”). By this time, Joyce’s eye­sight had almost com­plete­ly dimmed. Ogden pho­tographed the text and enlarged it so that the let­ters were a half-inch tall, yet Joyce still could bare­ly make them out and “sup­pos­ed­ly need­ed some­one to whis­per along” (Beach, who was not present, imag­ined he must have known the pas­sage by heart).\nJoyce chose to read from the “Anna Livia Plura­belle” sec­tion of the exper­i­men­tal text—a pas­sage “over­flow­ing,” writes Men­tal Floss, with “allu­sions to the world’s rivers.” He reads in the voice of an old wash­er­woman, and begins with a most suc­cinct state­ment of the tem­po­ral dimen­sions of lan­guage: “I told you every telling has a tail­ing.” Where Ulysses fore­grounds lit­er­ary his­to­ry, Finnegans Wake dives deep into geo­log­ic time, and priv­i­leges the oral over the writ­ten. These are the only two record­ings Joyce ever made, and they sure­ly mark what were for him cen­tral loca­tions in both books, though he also chose them for their ease of read­ing aloud and, per­haps, mem­o­riz­ing.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nJames Joyce, With His Eye­sight Fail­ing, Draws a Sketch of Leopold Bloom (1926)\nSylvia Beach Tells the Sto­ry of Found­ing Shake­speare and Com­pa­ny, Pub­lish­ing Joyce’s Ulysses, Sell­ing Copies of Hemingway’s First Book & More (1962)\nHear All of Finnegans Wake Read Aloud: A 35 Hour Read­ing\nWhat Makes James Joyce’s Ulysses a Mas­ter­piece: Great Books Explained\nVir­ginia Woolf on James Joyce’s Ulysses, “Nev­er Did Any Book So Bore Me.” Shen Then Quit at Page 200\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Life |   \tJanuary 9th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nTrevor Noah end­ed his stint as the host of The Dai­ly Show a lit­tle over three years ago, but he’s made him­self into anoth­er kind of pop-cul­tur­al pres­ence since then. In evi­dence, we have his appear­ance above on the pop­u­lar pod­cast and YouTube show Diary of a CEO. For more than two and a half hours, Noah dis­cuss­es with host Steven Bartlett (who, like Noah, also hap­pens to be African-born with mixed parent­age) his rea­sons for quit­ting that polit­i­cal-news-com­e­dy TV insti­tu­tion, his strug­gles with depres­sion, and the time his step­fa­ther shot his moth­er in the head. She lived, owing to the mirac­u­lous­ly unlike­ly tra­jec­to­ry of the bul­let, but that did­n’t stop the expe­ri­ence from becom­ing what Noah describes as the worst of his life.\nDis­cussing all this brings to his mind the Japan­ese art of kintsu­gi (pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture). “It’s a prac­tice of repair­ing pot­tery and ceram­ics that have bro­ken,” Noah explains. “What hap­pens is, you break a plate, or you break a vase or some­thing,” and “they put it back togeth­er, these arti­sans who do it. But they don’t just glue it back togeth­er, they glue it back togeth­er and they sort of adorn it with a gold­en bind­ing. And what you get is an object that is some­how more beau­ti­ful than before it was bro­ken.”\nKintsu­gi struck him as “one of the most beau­ti­ful con­cepts, and a dif­fer­ent way to think about being ‘fixed’ or ‘over­com­ing’ ”; it was­n’t “the idea that we are per­fect, the way we were before some­thing hap­pened to us, but rather, it is that we get to wear our cracks with a new type of pride, and a new type of beau­ty.”\nNoah would hard­ly be the only per­son to see in these recon­sti­tut­ed ceram­ic ves­sels with their gleam­ing kintsu­gi seams a metaphor for him­self. Like more than a few pub­lic fig­ures in the West, he’s been will­ing to dis­cuss the vicis­si­tudes of his life in detail, and even use them for mate­r­i­al in work like his stand-up com­e­dy and his mem­oir Born a Crime. But it is unusu­al, in a chat like this with mil­lions and mil­lions of view­ers, to hear ref­er­ence made to a half-mil­len­ni­um-old Japan­ese form of pot­tery repair. That pos­si­bil­i­ty, of course, is cen­tral to the appeal of long-form inter­view pod­casts, whose con­ver­sa­tions have the time and space to go far down unex­pect­ed paths. The Dai­ly Show may deliv­er more laughs per minute, but giv­en its for­mat’s time con­straints, kintsu­gi-type talk is no doubt the first thing to get edit­ed out — and the cut cer­tain­ly won’t be high­light­ed.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nA Visu­al Intro­duc­tion to Kintsu­gi, the Japan­ese Art of Repair­ing Bro­ken Pot­tery and Find­ing Beau­ty in Imper­fec­tion\nHow Japan­ese Kintsu­gi Mas­ters Restore Pot­tery by Beau­ti­fy­ing the Cracks\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nStanford’s Robert Sapol­sky Demys­ti­fies Depres­sion, Which, Like Dia­betes, Is Root­ed in Biol­o­gy\nStephen Fry on Cop­ing with Depres­sion: It’s Rain­ing, But the Sun Will Come Out Again\nCharles Bukows­ki Explains How to Beat Depres­sion: Spend 3–4 Days in Bed and You’ll Get the Juices Flow­ing Again (NSFW)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Throughout the MFA program you’ll explore new techniques, refine your artistic philosophy, and gain teaching experience at one of the top universities in the United States. As a global research university, Notre Dame also offers opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and international engagement, including funding for research travel. As a tier 1 research university, Notre Dame offers students access to world-class scholars and cultural events from across the institution. Our dedicated faculty work closely with graduate students to develop their work in a supportive and critical environment augmented by a program of visiting artists, designers, critics, and art historians. With easy access to the museums and galleries of Chicago (90 minutes away by car) and museums in Indianapolis, Toledo, and Detroit within a few hours of campus, students have ample opportunity to enrich their research and practice. We offer full tuition waivers to all students admitted to the MFA program. Additionally, a $28,500 stipend is awarded to all accepted students for each year of the program. A variety of grants and awards are available for students to support travel, supplies, and other research-based costs. These resources and the relatively low cost of living in South Bend, Indiana, help us offer a terminal degree program that doesn’t burden artists and designers with significant debt. The MFA degree in studio art or design is a three-year, 60-credit program. Graduate students pursue an area of interest through a system of independent study courses with the faculty. The MFA program also allows qualified graduate students to gain college-level teaching experience during their second and third years of study. Applications for fall 2026 are due February 1. To learn more, visit artdept.nd.edu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArt Education Announcements\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSponsored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

Missouri is among them, where the city of St. Louis has been the site of both tenacious (and pugnacious) expansionist gusto and, in the wake of midcentury de-industrialization, precipitous decline. As is often the case for American culture, it takes an outsider to gild our mythos, to redeem the dismissed as truly magnificent. German artist Anselm Kiefer has pulled this off for the Mississippi River and its surrounding territory. Anselm Kiefer: Becoming the Sea, on view at the Saint Louis Art Museum, is the Neo-Expressionist’s first major United States museum show in 20 years. The exhibition is a dazzling tour de force, displaying 40 works from the past half century, about half created in the last five years, along with five towering, site-specific canvases that line the museum’s vaulted 1904 Sculpture Hall. Anselm Kiefer, \"Missouri, Mississippi\" (2024), emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, gold leaf, sediment of electrolysis, and collage on canvas Becoming the Sea is a sublime instance of Kiefer’s inveterate (some might say shameless) Romanticism. Nostalgia for the Rhine River of his childhood flows into homages to the Mississippi as a symbol of both industry and creative freedom; the feminine spirits of the Indigenous North American Anishinaabe and Wabanaki people ebb into a reference to the “Rhinemaidens” of the Wagner opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung); tributes to German-Jewish poet Paul Celan splash against those of American Beat poet Gregory Corso, to whom the show owes its title. Philosophers and mythological figures loom within a visual language that convolutes cultural distinction within a Kiefer-verse of singular awe. Uniting much of his recent work is a palette of refulgent gold and aquamarine, the murky browns of the “muddy” Mississippi exalted as glittering spectacle. Among the most moving monuments to Rustbelt grandeur is “Missouri, Mississippi” (2024), a vertical diptych reaching over 30 feet. In the upper portion, a nude water nymph rests her body against the curves of the Missouri River, the cursive words “St. Louis” draped over her knee like a gilt scarf. In the lower portion, torrential waves crash against the gates of a dam, dark below a saffron sky (a scene evidently based on a visit Kiefer made to the Melvin Price Lock and Dam in 1991 at the river confluence in Alton, Illinois). While an aerial view of the river tributary denotes divine leisure, from below the manmade marvels of industry explode with rapturous energy. Anselm Kiefer, \"Dans ce vert linceul\" (2024), emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, gold leaf, and sediment of electrolysis on canvasGrowing up in the professed “Gateway to the West,” flanked by the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, water was part of my consciousness — whether breathing soupy summer air as a child or dancing at a casino in college at the confluence of the country’s two largest rivers. As an adult, I developed a keen, if unsettling, awareness of my provenance as “flyover country.” Even the airport, where my grandfather toiled for 30 years, was a dim shell of the modernist masterpiece designed by Minoru Yamasaki a half century prior. Taking in “Missouri, Mississippi,” it is hard to see “flyover” country in quite the same way again.In the galleries of the museum’s East Building, where most of the exhibition is located, the deliciously tactile nature of Kiefer’s green-and-gold ensemble is more approachable and intimate. In “Der Rhine” (The Rhine, 2024), the Black Forest’s thick branches form a fine brocade over the river, the leaves leaping from the surface like tongues of fire. On the opposite wall, “Dans ce vert linceul” (In This Green Shroud) (2024), which quotes lines of poetry from French Romanticist Gérard de Nerval, depicts a man lying on the ground holding a tall bouquet of yellow-petaled twigs. Donning the signature nightshirt of Kiefer’s earlier self-portraits, the supine figure appears at once relaxed and wondrous, a gesture perhaps to a oneness with nature as our own mortality approaches. Installation view of Anselm Kiefer, Die Frauen der Antike (2018–25)View of fallen trees in Forest Park, outside the Saint Louis Art Museum, December 2025In the Weil Gallery, works from the sculpture series Die Frauen der Antike (The Women of Antiquity) (2018–25) catch the light from a wall-length window overlooking a row of trees. When the show opened, the greenery outside stood in stark contrast to the white gowns that compose the figures, each one representing a renowned female artist or martyr (Sappho, St. Eulalia, and Thusnelda among them); in winter, the dresses eerily align with the bare branches outside. In spaces like these, the art is in dialogue with Forest Park, the city’s crown jewel, where the museum is located.So, too, does the corroded quality of the electrolysis and charcoal sediment coating many of Kiefer’s canvases seem to resonate with the oxidized nature of the Rustbelt. Newer paintings like “Becoming the Ocean, for Gregory Corso” (2024) betray visual and tactile traces of older works such as “Brennstabe” (Fuel Rods) (1984–87), part of the museum’s permanent collection. While still grand in scale, these pieces feel more at home in the gallery than some of the three-story works in the Sculpture Hall, which recall the glinting mosaic walls of the Cathedral Basilica a few miles east. Though breathtaking at first sight, once respiration is restored, some of these installations feel a bit one-note and self-aggrandizing. If Kiefer’s identity as a larger-than-life art world treasure is meant to be taken literally, then the space makes sense. But I found myself longing for a less lofty vision of rivers — one that retains the majesty that so inspired the artist, but also bears a sprinkle of human frailty.Thanks to a bevy of generous donors, Becoming the Sea is free to the public. Many people may simply bask in its epic proportions and empyreal beauty. There is some poetic justice to the show’s populist appeal, given that in May St. Louis was ravaged by the deadliest tornado in 70 years, and the park itself lost 5,000 trees. Just yards away from the museum entrance, a very different spectacle awaits: piles of branches and abandoned stumps resembling fallen spacecraft, a solemn reminder that if “Spirit is Life,” it is also so much loss and carnage. Whether we emerge from the exhibition less afraid than before depends not only on our response to Kiefer’s visionary imagery, but to our attitude toward art at large. But maybe I’m just being a Romantic. Anselm Kiefer, \"Becoming the ocean, for Gregory Corso\" (2024), emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, sediment of electrolysis, gold leaf, and stones on canvasAnselm Kiefer: Becoming the Sea continues at the Saint Louis Art Museum (One Fine Arts Drive, Forest Park, St. Louis, Missouri) through January 25.

President Trump's words about the murder — that Good \"violently, willfully, and viciously ran over\" the officer — differ sharply from video documentation of the event. Thousands gathered in vigil and protest that evening, turning President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's words against them via signs and banners. A demonstrator outside the ICE building in Washington, DC, for instance, wielded a banner reading \"domestic terrorist,\" mocking Noem's characterization of Good as a threat. It's just one instantiation of how art can disrupt official narratives, expose both the cruelty and flimsiness of MAGA's dehumanizing worldview, and forge bonds of solidarity. In these dark times, visual literacy and journalistic accuracy are more important than ever. Let us not forget that Good was herself a poet, an artist.

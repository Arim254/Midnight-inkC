    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tFebruary 3rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nLast year, we fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture the sto­ry of how a samu­rai end­ed up in the unlike­ly set­ting of sev­en­teenth-cen­tu­ry Venice. But as com­pelling­ly told as it was in video essay form by Evan Puschak, bet­ter known as the Nerd­writer, it end­ed just as things were get­ting inter­est­ing. We last left Haseku­ra Rokue­mon Tsune­na­ga as he was set­ting out on a mis­sion to Europe in order to meet the Pope and facil­i­tate the bro­ker­ing of a deal for his feu­dal lord, Date Masamune. Hav­ing struck up a friend­ship with a Japan­ese-speak­ing Fran­cis­can fri­ar called Luis Sote­lo, whose mis­sion­ary hos­pi­tal had saved the life of one of his con­cu­bines, Date got it in his head that he should estab­lish a direct rela­tion­ship with the mighty Span­ish empire.\nOf course, in 1613, it was­n’t quite as easy as catch­ing a flight from Tokyo (or rather, in those days, Edo) to Rome. Mak­ing the long pas­sage by ship were about 180 Japan­ese, Por­tuguese, and Span­ish men, many of whom had nev­er been out on the open ocean before. After two less-than-smooth months, they land­ed 200 miles north of what we now call San Fran­cis­co, then made their way down the coast to Aca­pul­co, then a city in what was known as the colony of New Spain. From there, Date’s embassy went inland to the pow­er cen­ter of Mex­i­co City, then to Ver­acruz on the east coast, from whose port it could take anoth­er ship all the way across the Atlantic from New Spain to old.\nThe Span­ish king Philip had his reser­va­tions about open­ing trade rela­tion­ships with Japan, as grant­i­ng that dis­tant land “access to the Pacif­ic would risk turn­ing this exclu­sive impe­r­i­al cor­ri­dor into a shared com­mer­cial space.” The prospect of lim­it­ed inte­gra­tion, con­trolled by the hand of Spain, had appealed to him, but the dis­rup­tion caused by the embassy’s arrival soured him on even that idea. To Haseku­ra’s mind, the way for­ward lay in bol­ster­ing Japan­ese Catholi­cism. Though bap­tized in 1615 in Philip’s pres­ence, the samu­rai retain­er found that he could pre­vail upon the king no fur­ther. Onward, then, to the Eter­nal City, where, on the night of Octo­ber 25th, 1615, Haseku­ra man­aged to kiss the feet of the Pope.\nA few days there­after, Haseku­ra was offi­cial­ly made a cit­i­zen of Rome. Alas, the Pope proved either unwill­ing or unable to help estab­lish­ing the desired trade links, and mean­while, back in Japan, the new shō­gun Toku­gawa Ieya­su had expelled all mis­sion­ar­ies from Japan and ordered the destruc­tion of all the insti­tu­tions they’d built. Haseku­ra, it turns out, nev­er actu­al­ly made it to Venice; his let­ters, whose dis­cov­ery opened part one of this series, had just been sent there in a futile appeal for funds. After the embassy’s return to Japan, Sote­lo ful­filled his expec­ta­tion of achiev­ing mar­tyr­dom there. How Haseku­ra lived out the rest of his unusu­al life back in his home­land is only sketchi­ly known, but one sus­pects that, what­ev­er hap­pened, he nev­er imag­ined him­self becom­ing an object of world­wide fas­ci­na­tion four cen­turies after his death.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Mys­tery of How a Samu­rai End­ed up in 17th Cen­tu­ry Venice\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nPho­to by Al Aumuller, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nLike anoth­er famous Okie from Musko­gee, Woody Guthrie came from a part of Okla­homa that the U.S. gov­ern­ment sold dur­ing the 1889 land rush away from the Qua­paw and Osage nations, as well as the Musco­gee, a peo­ple who had been forcibly relo­cat­ed from the South­east under Andrew Jackson’s Indi­an Removal Act. By the time of Guthrie’s birth in 1912 in Okfus­kee Coun­ty, next to Musko­gee, the region was in the hands of con­ser­v­a­tive Democ­rats like Guthrie’s father Charles, a landown­er and mem­ber of the revived KKK who par­tic­i­pat­ed in a bru­tal lynch­ing the year before Guthrie was born.\nGuthrie was named after pres­i­dent Woodrow Wil­son, who was high­ly sym­pa­thet­ic to Jim Crow (but per­haps not, as has been alleged, an admir­er of the Klan). While he inher­it­ed many of his father’s atti­tudes, he recon­sid­ered them to such a degree lat­er in life that he wrote a song denounc­ing the noto­ri­ous­ly racist New York land­lord Fred Trump, father of the cur­rent pres­i­dent. “By the time he moved into his new apart­ment” in Brook­lyn in 1950, writes Will Kauf­man at The Guardian, Guthrie “had trav­eled a long road from the casu­al racism of his Okla­homa youth.”\nGuthrie was deeply embed­ded in the for­ma­tive racial pol­i­tics of the coun­try. While some peo­ple may con­vince them­selves that a time in the U.S. past was “great”—unmarred by class con­flict and racist vio­lence and exploita­tion, secure in the hands of a benev­o­lent white majority—Guthrie’s life tells a much more com­plex sto­ry. Many Indige­nous peo­ple feel with good rea­son that Guthrie’s most famous song, “The Land is Your Land,” has con­tributed to nation­al­ist mythol­o­gy. Oth­ers have viewed the song as a Marx­ist anthem. Like much else about Guthrie, and the coun­try, it’s com­pli­cat­ed.\n\n\n\t\n\nCon­sid­ered by many, Stephen Petrus writes, “to be the alter­na­tive nation­al anthem,” the song “to many peo­ple… rep­re­sents America’s best pro­gres­sive and demo­c­ra­t­ic tra­di­tions.” Guthrie turned the song into a hymn for the strug­gle against fas­cism and for the nascent Civ­il Rights move­ment. Writ­ten in New York in 1940 and first record­ed for Moe Asch’s Folk­ways Records in 1944, “This Land is Your Land” evolved over time, drop­ping vers­es protest­ing pri­vate prop­er­ty and pover­ty after the war in favor of a far more patri­ot­ic tone. It was a long evo­lu­tion from embit­tered par­o­dy of “God Bless Amer­i­ca” to “This land was made for you and me.”\n\n\n\t\n\nBut whether social­ist or pop­ulist in nature, Guthrie’s patri­o­tism was always sub­ver­sive. “By 1940,” writes John Pietaro, he had “joined forces with Pete Seeger in the Almanac Singers,” who “as a group, joined the Com­mu­nist Par­ty. Woody’s gui­tar had, by then, been adorned with the hand-paint­ed epi­taph, THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS.” (Guthrie had at least two gui­tars with the slo­gan scrawled on them, one on a stick­er and one with ragged hand-let­ter­ing.) The phrase, claims music crit­ic Jon­ny White­side, was orig­i­nal­ly “a morale-boost­ing WWII gov­ern­ment slo­gan print­ed on stick­ers that were hand­ed out to defense plant work­ers.” Guthrie reclaimed the pro­pa­gan­da for folk music’s role in the cul­ture. As Pietaro tells it:\nIn this time he also found­ed an inter-racial quar­tet with Lead­bel­ly, Son­ny Ter­ry and Cis­co Hous­ton, a ver­i­ta­ble super-group he named the Head­line Singers. This group, sad­ly, nev­er record­ed. The mate­r­i­al must have stood as the height of protest song—he’d named it in oppo­si­tion to a pro­duc­er who advised Woody to “stop try­ing to sing the head­lines.” Woody told us that all you can write is what you see.\nYou can hear The Head­line Singers above, minus Lead Bel­ly and fea­tur­ing Pete Seeger, in the ear­ly 1940’s radio broad­cast of “All You Fas­cists Bound to Lose.” “I’m gonna tell you fas­cists,” sings Woody, “you may be sur­prised, peo­ple in this world are get­ting orga­nized.” Upon join­ing the Mer­chant Marines, Guthrie fought against seg­re­ga­tion in the mil­i­tary. After the war, he “stood shoul­der to shoul­der with Paul Robe­son, Howard Fast, and Pete Seeger” against vio­lent racist mobs in Peek­skill, New York. Both of Guthrie’s anti-fas­cist gui­tars have seem­ing­ly dis­ap­peared. As Robert San­tel­li writes, “Guthrie didn’t care for his instru­ments with much love.” But dur­ing the decade of the 1940’s he was nev­er seen with­out the slo­gan on his pri­ma­ry instru­ment.\n\n“This Machine Kills Fas­cists” has since, writes Moth­er­board, become Guthrie’s “trade­mark slo­gan… still ref­er­enced in pop cul­ture and beyond” and pro­vid­ing an impor­tant point of ref­er­ence for the anti-fas­cist punk move­ment. You can see anoth­er of Guthrie’s anti-fas­cist slo­gans above, which he scrawled on a col­lec­tion of his sheet music: “Fas­cism fought indoors and out, good & bad weath­er.” Guthrie’s long-lived broth­er-in-arms Pete Seeger, car­ried on in the tra­di­tion of anti-fas­cism and anti-racism after Woody suc­cumbed in the last two decades of his life to Huntington’s dis­ease. Like Guthrie, Seeger paint­ed a slo­gan around the rim of his instru­ment of choice, the ban­jo, a mes­sage both play­ful and mil­i­tant: “This machine sur­rounds hate and forces it to sur­ren­der.”\n\nPho­to by “Jim, the Pho­tog­ra­ph­er”\nSeeger car­ried the mes­sage from his days play­ing and singing with Guthrie, to his Civ­il Rights and anti-war orga­niz­ing and protest in the 50s and 60s, and all the way into the 21st cen­tu­ry at Occu­py Wall Street in Man­hat­tan in 2011. At the 2009 inau­gu­ra­tion of Barack Oba­ma, Seeger sang “This Land is Your Land” onstage with Bruce Spring­steen and his son, Tao-Rodriquez Singer. In rehearsals, he insist­ed on singing the two vers­es Guthrie had omit­ted from the song after the war. “So it was,” writes John Nichols at The Nation, “that the new­ly elect­ed pres­i­dent of the Unit­ed States began his inau­gur­al cel­e­bra­tion by singing and clap­ping along with an old lefty who remem­bered the Depres­sion-era ref­er­ences of a song that took a class-con­scious swipe at those whose ‘Pri­vate Prop­er­ty’ signs turned away union orga­niz­ers, hobos and ban­jo pick­ers.”\nBoth Guthrie and Seeger drew direct con­nec­tions between the fas­cism and racism they fought and cap­i­tal­is­m’s out­sized, destruc­tive obses­sion with land and mon­ey. They felt so strong­ly about the bat­tle that they wore their mes­sages fig­u­ra­tive­ly on their sleeves and lit­er­al­ly on their instru­ments. Pete Seeger’s famous ban­jo has out­lived its own­er, and the col­or­ful leg­end around it has been mass-pro­duced by Deer­ing Ban­jos. Where Guthrie’s anti-fas­cist gui­tars went off to is any­one’s guess, but if one of them were ever dis­cov­ered, Robert San­tel­li writes, “it sure­ly would become one of Amer­i­ca’s most val­ued folk instru­ments.” Or one of its most val­ued instru­ments in gen­er­al.\n\nPho­to by “Jim, the Pho­tog­ra­ph­er”\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nBruce Spring­steen Won’t Back Down: Per­forms “Streets of Min­neapo­lis” Live in Min­neapo­lis\nHear Two Leg­ends, Lead Bel­ly & Woody Guthrie, Per­form­ing on the Same Radio Show (1940)\nThe Nazis’ 10 Con­trol-Freak Rules for Jazz Per­form­ers: A Strange List from World War II\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

We’ll also remem­ber the scant few Amer­i­can fig­ures who refused to back down. Bruce Spring­steen will be high on that short list.\nTour­ing in Europe last sum­mer, Spring­steen warned his audi­ence: “The Amer­i­ca that I love, the Amer­i­ca I have writ­ten about, that has been a bea­con of hope and lib­er­ty for 250 years, is cur­rent­ly in the hands of a cor­rupt, incom­pe­tent and trea­so­nous admin­is­tra­tion.” Those words seem par­tic­u­lar­ly pre­scient giv­en the chaos and vio­lence now unfold­ing in Min­neso­ta.\nFol­low­ing the shoot­ings of Renee Good and Alex Pret­ti, Spring­steen made his voice heard again—this time through music. Last week, he released the protest song “Streets of Min­neapo­lis” and soon after­ward trav­eled to Min­neso­ta to per­form the song live at a ben­e­fit con­cert arranged by Tom Morel­lo. Speak­ing to the crowd, Spring­steen said, “I wrote Streets of Min­neapo­lis and record­ed it the next day.” When he won­dered if the song sound­ed too ‘soap­boxy,’ he turned to Morel­lo, and the Rage Against the Machine gui­tarist replied, “Bruce, nuance is won­der­ful, but some­times you need to kick them in the teeth.” We’ll say amen to that.\nAfter “Streets of Min­neapo­lis,” Spring­steen and Morel­lo per­formed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” Watch it above. The start of the show began with “Killing In The Name Of.” Catch it below.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\nScott Gal­loway Unveils “Resist and Unsub­scribe,” an Action Plan for Con­sumers to Push Back Against Gov­ern­ment Over­reach\nTom Morel­lo Responds to Angry Fans Who Sud­den­ly Real­ize That Rage Against the Machine’s Music Is Polit­i­cal: “What Music of Mine DIDN’T Con­tain Polit­i­cal BS?”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough his movies may have ben­e­fit­ed great­ly from for­eign audi­ences and back­ers, David Lynch was one of the most thor­ough­ly Amer­i­can of all film­mak­ers. “Born Mis­soula, MT,” declared his Twit­ter bio, yet one nev­er real­ly asso­ciates him with a par­tic­u­lar place in the Unit­ed States (at least no extant one). From Mon­tana, the Lynch fam­i­ly moved to Ida­ho, then Wash­ing­ton, then North Car­oli­na, then Vir­ginia. The tim­ing of that last stint proved cul­tur­al­ly for­tu­itous indeed: liv­ing in the city of Alexan­dria, the eigh­teen-year-old Lynch was close enough to the nation’s cap­i­tal to attend the very first con­cert the Bea­t­les played in North Amer­i­ca, at the Wash­ing­ton Col­i­se­um on Feb­ru­ary 11, 1964.\n“I was into rock and roll music, main­ly Elvis Pres­ley.” Lynch recalls this unsur­pris­ing fact in the clip above (which would have been among the last inter­views he gave before his death a year ago) from Bea­t­les ’64, the Mar­tin Scors­ese-pro­duced doc­u­men­tary on the Fab Four’s first U.S. tour.\n“I didn’t have any idea how big this event was. And it was in a gigan­tic place where they had box­ing match­es. The Bea­t­les were in the box­ing ring. It was so loud, you can’t believe. Girls shud­der­ing, cry­ing, scream­ing their heart out. It was phe­nom­e­nal.” That deaf­en­ing crowd noise fig­ures into most every account of the group’s Beat­le­ma­nia-era shows — and played a deci­sive role in their per­ma­nent retreat into the stu­dio a cou­ple of years lat­er.\nLynch sure­ly would have under­stood the desire for artis­tic explo­ration and con­trol that drove the Bea­t­les’ con­cen­tra­tion on mak­ing records. Even the sen­si­bil­i­ties of his work and theirs had some­thing in com­mon, exhibit­ing as they both did the unlike­ly com­bi­na­tion of pop­u­lar­i­ty and exper­i­men­ta­tion.  Some­how, David Lynch’s films and the Bea­t­les’ albums could ven­ture into bewil­der­ing obscu­ri­ty and sen­ti­men­tal kitsch with­out los­ing coher­ence or crit­i­cal respect. And dare one imag­ine that the expe­ri­ence of wit­ness­ing the Amer­i­can debut of what would become the most influ­en­tial rock band of all time has giv­en Lynch his appre­ci­a­tion — evi­dent in his movies, but also his own record­ings — for the pow­er of music, which he calls “one of the most fan­tas­tic things”?

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“Imagine a world based on a different logic; a universe comprised of the absurd and paradoxes,” prompts Bruno Pontiroli, whose paintings explore the sometimes grotesque tension between the familiar and the uncanny.\nThe artist is known for his absurdist paintings of animals with overly long legs, contorted bodies, or myriad mutant-like heads or limbs. They’re often set amid woodlands or meadows evocative of 18th- and 19th-century academic landscape paintings or depictions of formal hunts. Instead, both domesticated and wild animals graze as normally as they would without dozens of heads or udders attached in unnatural places around their bodies.\n“De mal en pis” (2025), 70 x 80 centimeters\nThere’s something inherently disturbing about an elephant with a body cloaked in trunks or a giraffe with multiple heads and limbs jutting out in all directions. Despite their bucolic settings and generally calm or curious demeanors, as if nothing is amiss, Pontiroli’s paintings evoke a slight sense of dread. What have we done to cause this?\nSee more on the Pontiroli’s Instagram.\n“Les cous montés” (2025), 130 x 97 centimeters\n“Le trotteur” (2025), 80 x 70 centimeters\n“Il trompe son monde” (2025), 130 x 162 centimeters\n“Jo” (2025), 100 x 81 centimeters\n“L’un dans l’autre” (2025), 130 x 97 centimeters\n“Copains comme cochons #2” (2025), 60 x 50 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFashion reflects and influences culture. The 2026 Vilcek Prizes in Fashion & Design highlight immigrants elevating fashion through design practice, material innovation, makeup, and hairstyling. As part of its mission to uplift immigrants working in the arts and sciences, the Vilcek Foundation has awarded $250,000 to four immigrant fashion professionals: Peter Do, Jacques Agbobly, Marcelo Gutierrez, and Uyen Tran. \nThese prizes underscore the significance of immigrants and fashion to culture in the United States by recognizing the foreign-born individuals who bring their voices, cultural memories, and immigrant experiences to their work. Their unique creations not only capture the current cultural landscape but also encourage society to question artificial constructs of beauty. \n\nPeter Do\nPeter Do: Vilcek Prize for Fashion & Design\nPeter Do received the $100,000 Vilcek Prize in Fashion & Design for creating versatile clothing for everyday life without sacrificing durability or comfort. When he was 14, Do moved from his native Vietnam to the suburbs of Philadelphia, which exposed him to the often turbulent life of immigrants in the U.S. His mother helped steady him during this time, teaching Do the importance of resiliency. She and other women remain primary sources of inspiration for his creations.\n\nThe $50,000 Vilcek Prizes for Creative Promise in Fashion & Design have been awarded to Jacques Agbobly, Marcelo Gutierrez, and Uyen Tran. \nJacques Agbobly\nJacques Agbobly: Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Fashion & Design\nJacques Agbobly centers Afropolitan identity, Black multiplicity, and diasporic memory in their designs. They were inspired to pursue a career in fashion after witnessing their mother braiding hair to support their new life after immigrating to Chicago from Togo. Agbobly is now a full-time designer and professor at Parsons School of Design, and continues to build an American fashion house that centers Black identity while carrying forward the craftsmanship and memory of their home country. \nMarcelo Gutierrez\nMarcelo Gutierrez: Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Fashion & Design\nMarcelo Gutierrez is redefining beauty standards in the industry through his subversive and culturally grounded makeup artistry. An immigrant from Colombia, Gutierrez has become one of the most sought-after makeup artists and creative directors in the US. His work redefines who is seen, celebrated, and considered beautiful in fashion. \nUyen Tran \nUyen Tran: Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Fashion & Design\nUyen Tran is recognized for her leadership in the development of sustainable products that support the health of people and the planet without sacrificing quality. Growing up in the coastal city of Da Nang, Vietnam, Tran witnessed the horrific environmental effects of climate change caused by fast-fashion practices. She founded TômTex Inc., named after the Vietnamese word for plants, which transforms mushrooms and organic materials into fabrics that mimic the beauty and performance of leather without plastics or toxins.\nTo learn more, visit vilcek.org.\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Zhu writes about the project: “Garden serves as a metaphor for the meeting of the natural and the man-made. A garden is a space where nature and human intention intertwine: neither wholly wild nor entirely artificial.”\nFind more on Beauty of Science’s Behance and website.

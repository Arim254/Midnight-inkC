    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nHere’s anoth­er thing you can cred­it Thomas Jef­fer­son with: being the first known Amer­i­can to record an ice cream recipe. It’s one of 10 sur­viv­ing recipes writ­ten by the found­ing father.\nAccord­ing to Monticello.org, ice cream began appear­ing “in French cook­books start­ing in the late 17th cen­tu­ry, and in Eng­lish-lan­guage cook­books in the ear­ly 18th cen­tu­ry.” And there “are accounts of ice cream being served in the Amer­i­can colonies as ear­ly as 1744.” Jef­fer­son like­ly tast­ed his fair share of the dessert while liv­ing in France (1784–1789), and it con­tin­ued to be served at Mon­ti­cel­lo upon his return to Vir­ginia. By the first decade of the 19th cen­tu­ry, ice cream became increas­ing­ly com­mon in cook­books pub­lished through­out the U.S.\nYou can see the entire recipe for Jef­fer­son­’s vanil­la ice cream here, and read a tran­script below.\n2. bot­tles of good cream.\n6. yolks of eggs.\n1/2 lb. sug­ar\nmix the yolks & sug­ar\nput the cream on a fire in a casse­role, first putting in a stick of Vanil­la.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off & pour it gen­tly into the mix­ture of eggs & sug­ar.\nstir it well.\nput it on the fire again stir­ring it thor­ough­ly with a spoon to pre­vent it’s stick­ing to the casse­role.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off and strain it thro’ a tow­el.\nput it in the Sabottiere[12]\nthen set it in ice an hour before it is to be served. put into the ice a hand­ful of salt.\nput salt on the cov­er­lid of the Sabotiere & cov­er the whole with ice.\nleave it still half a quar­ter of an hour.\nthen turn the Sabot­tiere in the ice 10 min­utes\nopen it to loosen with a spat­u­la the ice from the inner sides of the Sabotiere.\nshut it & replace it in the ice\nopen it from time to time to detach the ice from the sides\nwhen well tak­en (prise) stir it well with the Spat­u­la.\nput it in moulds, justling it well down on the knee.\nthen put the mould into the same buck­et of ice.\nleave it there to the moment of serv­ing it.\nto with­draw it, immerse the mould in warm water, turn­ing it well till it will come out & turn it into a plate\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe First Amer­i­can Cook­book: Sam­ple Recipes from Amer­i­can Cook­ery (1796)\nLeo Tolstoy’s Fam­i­ly Recipe for Mac and Cheese\nErnest Hemingway’s Favorite Ham­burg­er Recipe\nThe Recipes of Icon­ic Authors: Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath, Roald Dahl, the Mar­quis de Sade & More\nMoMA’s Artists’ Cook­book (1978) Reveals the Meals of Sal­vador Dalí, Willem de Koon­ing, Andy Warhol, Louise Bour­geois & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nHow to Actu­al­ly Cook Sal­vador Dali’s Sur­re­al­ist Recipes: Cray­fish, Prawns, and Spit­ted Eggs\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Books |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImag­ine you could talk to Hierony­mus Bosch, the authors of the Book of Rev­e­la­tion, or of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script—a bizarre 15th cen­tu­ry text writ­ten in an uncrack­able code; that you could solve cen­turies-old mys­ter­ies by ask­ing them, “what were you think­ing?” You might be dis­ap­point­ed to hear them say, as does Lui­gi Ser­afi­ni, author and illus­tra­tor of the Codex Seraphini­anus, “At the end of the day [it’s] sim­i­lar to the Rorschach inkblot test. You see what you want to see. You might think it’s speak­ing to you, but it’s just your imag­i­na­tion.”\nIf you were a long­time devo­tee of an intense­ly sym­bol­ic, myth­ic text, you might refuse to believe this. It must mean some­thing, fans of the Codex have insist­ed since the book’s appear­ance in 1981.\nIt shares many sim­i­lar­i­ties with the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, save its rel­a­tive­ly recent vin­tage and liv­ing author: both the Seraphini­anus and the Voyn­ich seem to be com­pendi­ums of an oth­er­world­ly nat­ur­al sci­ence and art, and both are writ­ten in a whol­ly invent­ed lan­guage.\n\nSer­afi­ni tells Wired he thinks Voyn­ich is a fake. “The Holy Roman Emper­or Rudolf II loved ancient man­u­scripts; some­body swin­dled him and spread the rumor that it was orig­i­nal. The idea of made-up lan­guages is not new at all.” As for his own made-up lan­guage in the Codex, he avers, “I always said that there is no mean­ing behind the script; it’s just a game.” But it is not a hoax. Though he hasn’t mind­ed the mon­ey from the book’s cult pop­u­lar­i­ty, he cre­at­ed the book, he says, “try­ing to reach out to my fel­low peo­ple, just like blog­gers do.” It is, he says, “the prod­uct of a gen­er­a­tion that chose to con­nect and cre­ate a net­work, rather than kill each oth­er in wars like their fathers did.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe Codex, writes Abe Books, who made the short video review above, is “essen­tial­ly an ency­clo­pe­dia about an alien world that clear­ly reflects our own, each chap­ter appears to deal with key facets of this sur­re­al place, includ­ing flo­ra, fau­na, sci­ence, machines, games and archi­tec­ture.” That’s only a guess giv­en the unin­tel­li­gi­ble lan­guage.\nThe illus­tra­tions seem to draw from Bosch, Leonar­do da Vin­ci, and the medieval trav­el­ogue as much as from the sur­re­al­ism of con­tem­po­rary Euro­pean artists like Fan­tas­tic Plan­et ani­ma­tor René Laloux.\n\nSer­afi­ni has been delight­ed to see an exten­sive inter­net com­mu­ni­ty coa­lesce around the book, and has had his fun with it. He “now states,” writes Dan­ger­ous Minds, “that a stray white cat that joined him while he cre­at­ed the Codex in Rome in the 1970s was actu­al­ly the real author, tele­path­i­cal­ly guid­ing Ser­afi­ni as he drew and ‘wrote.’” You can now, thanks to a recent, rel­a­tive­ly afford­able edi­tion pub­lished by Riz­zoli, pur­chase your copy of the Codex. Buy now, I’d say. First edi­tions of the book now fetch upwards of $6000, and its pop­u­lar­i­ty shows no sign of slow­ing.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:  \nA Dig­i­tal Archive of Hierony­mus Bosch’s Com­plete Works: Zoom In & Explore His Sur­re­al Art\nExplore a Dig­i­tized Edi­tion of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, “the World’s Most Mys­te­ri­ous Book”\nCarl Jung’s Hand-Drawn, Rarely-Seen Man­u­script The Red Book\nThe Foot-Lick­ing Demons & Oth­er Strange Things in a 1921 Illus­trat­ed Man­u­script from Iran\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tFebruary 24th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn ancient Egypt, writ­ing hiero­glyphs was a high­ly spe­cial­ized skill, one com­mand­ed by only a small frac­tion of the pop­u­la­tion. The fact that there were more than 1,000 char­ac­ters to mem­o­rize prob­a­bly had some­thing to do with that, but the vari­ety of sur­faces on which hiero­glyphs were writ­ten could­n’t have made it any eas­i­er. Depend­ing on the occa­sion, ancient Egyp­tians used papyrus, wood, met­al, and pot­tery shards as writ­ing sur­faces. The most mon­u­men­tal or reli­gious­ly impor­tant texts, how­ev­er, got carved into stone, thus ensur­ing the words a kind of eter­nal life — a par­tic­u­lar con­cern in the cas­es of tomb walls and sar­copha­gi.\nThere may be lit­tle call to write hiero­glyphs today, but the tech­niques to do so haven’t been lost. In the new video above from the Vic­to­ria and Albert Muse­um, sculp­tor and stone carv­er Miri­am John­son demon­strates how to carve into stone the name of Pharaoh Khu­fu, who built the Great Pyra­mid (and indeed, was buried in it).\nThe first step is to write that name, sur­round­ed by its car­touche, on a sheet of car­bon paper. This isn’t the brush and ink that the ancient Egyp­tians would have used, grant­ed, but for the rest of the project, John­son sticks to the old-fash­ioned ways. With the image trans­ferred, and using noth­ing more than a mal­let and a chis­el, she carves the hiero­glyphs into the stone not just once but twice.\nThe first time, John­son carves in “sunken relief,” a tech­nique that involves cut­ting the image out of the sur­face of the stone. The sec­ond time, she ren­ders Pharaoh Khu­fu’s name in “raised relief,” which requires cut­ting out every­thing but the image, cre­at­ing the effect of the hiero­glyphs ris­ing out of the stone. With the for­mer “you see more of the shad­ows”; with the lat­ter, “you’ve got more oppor­tu­ni­ty of putting more tex­ture into the char­ac­ters.” Seen in a state of com­ple­tion — by a lay­man, at least — John­son’s carv­ings would­n’t look out of place in a muse­um exhib­it on ancient Egypt. Even if tools man­u­fac­tured in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry pro­duce a few sub­tle dif­fer­ences from the real thing, give these stones a mil­len­ni­um or two to age, and they’ll sure­ly look even more con­vinc­ing.\nvia Kot­tke\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow to Read Ancient Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs: A British Muse­um Cura­tor Explains\nAn Ani­mat­ed Intro­duc­tion to the Roset­ta Stone, and How It Unlocked Our Under­stand­ing of Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs\nWhat Ancient Egypt­ian Sound­ed Like & How We Know It\n3,200-Year-Old Egypt­ian Tablet Records Excus­es for Why Peo­ple Missed Work: “The Scor­pi­on Bit Him,” “Brew­ing Beer” & More\nYou Could Soon Be Able to Text with 2,000 Ancient Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs\nWatch a Mas­ter­piece Emerge from a Sol­id Block of Stone\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

In the artist’s characteristically smooth, cartoonish, vivid illustrations, creatures peer out from between giant leaves, cling to palm trees, and nap on long branches. She has also begun incorporating animated elements that enliven the scenes.\n“At the same time, living on the island has revealed the fragility of nature’s balance,” Maka tells Colossal. “The lush tropical landscape conceals the vulnerability of the ecosystem and the delicate relationship between humans and the natural world.” Through these observations, both beauty and fragility have become key themes in her recent works.\n“Frog”\nFind more on Maka’s Behance and Instagram, and support her work on Patreon.\n“Palm Squirrel”\n“Beast”\n“Among the Trees”\n“Owl”\n“Sloth”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

But when these otherworldly all-white mammals appear—such as the beloved Migaloo that was first spotted in 1991 off Australia’s east coast—they inspire wonder.\nMarine photographer Jono Allen captured a unique shot of a baby white humpback being nudged by its mother, taking the top prize in the 2026 World Nature Photography Awards (WNPA), in addition to winning the Underwater category.\n© Miki Spitzer, “The eye of the dragon.” Gold in the Planet Earth’s Landscapes and Environments category\nThe seventh edition of WNPA continues to highlight the diversity, beauty, and inherent vulnerability of our planet’s wildlife and ecosystems. From Mary Schrader’s tender portrait of a gorilla observing a butterfly to Miki Spitzer’s enigmatic drone photo of a mineral pool that looks like the close-up of a dragon’s eye, all of the winning photos emphasize curiosity and awe.\nThe contest is now accepting entries for its 2027 edition.

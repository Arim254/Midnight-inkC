The 2026 Martin Luther King Jr. holiday unfolds in a year already punctuated by public outrage as the Trump administration defends Immigration and Customs Enforcement violence and seeks to erase the nation's racist history. At the Kennedy Center, which Trump retained control over last year after criticizing \"woke\" programming, an annual concert celebrating King, Let Freedom Ring, has opted to play elsewhere.Cultural institutions across New York City, including the newly reopened Studio Museum in Harlem, are upholding commitments to honor the civil rights leader on a day his wife once described as \"a focal point for encouraging improved race relations.\" Below are five events commemorating the civil rights titan's life and legacy — from family-friendly activities to Mayor Zohran Mamdani performing one of King's sermons at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.The Studio Museum in HarlemThe Studio Museum will hold thematic art-making events on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. (photo courtesy the Studio Museum)After a seven-year closure, the Studio Museum will celebrate its first-ever Martin Luther King Jr. Day in its new building on Monday, January 19. During a free day of programming at the Harlem museum campus, the institution will lead the public of all ages in activities commemorating King's activism. The day will begin with a children's storytime featuring books written or illustrated by individuals of African descent; later in the day, the museum will host thematic art-making workshops, and curators will tour visitors through resonant works in its collections. The event is free and open to the public. Brooklyn Children's MuseumFrom 10am to 5pm on Monday, the Brooklyn Children's Museum in Crown Heights will hold a day-long programming series including shadow puppetry, community service projects, and an appearance by Grammy-nominated musician and social justice advocate Harold \"FYÜTCH\" Simmons II. Tickets are $15. Wave Hill: Freedom Quilters of Gee’s BendRita Mae Pettway of Gee's Bend in 2005 with a quilt by her grandmother (photo by Ted Fitzgerald/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images)On Sunday, January 18, from 10 am to 1 pm, family members are invited to create fabric collages in honor of King and the legacy of Gee’s Bend quilters at the Wave Hill House in the Bronx. The activity draws upon the history of Gee’s Bend  in Alabama, home to one of the most extraordinary quilting traditions in American history. A group of Black craftswomen in the community formed the Freedom Quilting Bee cooperative after King visited the area in 1966. The event is free with admission to Wave Hill House. Beyond Vietnam: MLK’s Call for Peace at the New York HistoricalFrom 12 pm to 2 pm on Sunday, the New York Historical will hold a family-friendly activity drawing upon King's 1967 anti-war speech at Manhattan's Riverside Church, \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence.\" The institution will also host a peace sign wall-hanging workshop. The event is free with admission to the museum. BAM's 40th Annual King TributeA BAM Kids event celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (photo courtesy BAM)The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in the Fort Greene neighborhood is hosting its 40th annual tribute event on Monday, with a reading of Dr. King's “Drum Major Instinct” sermon performed by Mayor Zohran Mamdani and others. Events for children include a movement activity and a letter-writing workshop. BAM will also present a screening of the film Just Mercy (2019). Doors to this free public event open at 8 am.

This haunting, abraded pastel and paint work is part of the revelatory exhibition Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson.A longtime resident of Boston, a city that never developed an artistic identity as strong as New York’s or some other major US cities, Wilson was a painter, public sculptor, printmaker, teacher, children’s book illustrator, and activist. He was known and respected among fellow Black artists, yet practically invisible in the mainstream, White art world to the extent that his work is seldom included in surveys of modern and contemporary Black artists working in the United States. This much-needed exhibition — originating at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which holds the largest single collection of his art, at 90 works — should bring him the visibility he has long deserved.John Wilson, \"My Brother\" (1942), oil on panel; Smith College Museum of Art (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Wilson’s parents, who immigrated to the US from British Guiana (now Guyana), encouraged him to study art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. When he realized that Black people were not represented in the museum’s collection, he devoted himself to “witnessing [their] humanity.” This realization anticipates that of internationally recognized Black contemporary artists such as Kerry James Marshall, who told Griselda Murray Brown of the Financial Times, in 2018: \"It’s less about changing the narrative than it is about participating, being a part of it.”After graduating from Tufts University (which is connected to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts), he received the James William Paige Traveling Fellowship in 1947. It enabled him to go to Paris, where he studied with the French artist Fernand Léger. Wilson was attracted to Léger because of his socialist and humanist beliefs, and his commitment to celebrating the dignity of workers. These convictions would grow stronger for Wilson over the years, setting him apart from the American avant-garde’s growing commitment to art for art’s sake, a stance from which many Black artists felt understandably estranged, particularly at a time when the Civil Rights movement was beginning to foment.Installation view of Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (photo Hyla Skopitz, courtesy The Met)In the summer of 1949, after returning from Europe, Wilson taught at Camp Wo-Chi-Ca (an acronym for Worker’s Children’s Camp) in New Jersey, where he met Elizabeth Catlett and Paul Robeson. The next year, he visited Mexico on a John Hay Whitney Foundation grant, where he stayed until 1956, studying mural painting in Mexico City, and connecting with David Alfaro Siqueiros. His classmates included Catlett and Charles White, who would later teach and influence Kerry James Marshall’s art. Two things should be clear from Wilson’s biography. He, along with White, Catlett, and their peers, were where the action was and, like them, his story centers on being a Black artist determined to be “a part of the narrative,” particularly in terms of what it was like to live in the US in the 20th century. In this regard, Wilson is both important as an individual artist and essential to understanding American history and art. In fact, an institution should organize an exhibition highlighting the artists, writers, and others who taught at the interracial Camp Wo-Chi-Ca — among them, Jacob Lawrence, Gwendolyn Knight, and the dancer Pearl Primus. John Wilson, \"Streetcar Scene\" (1945), lithograph; The Metropolitan Museum of Art (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Wilson portrayed the gamut of the Black experience, making visible the sense of deep isolation, fear, and apprehension accompanying oppression and marginalization in the US, as well as pride, family, and community. His lithograph “Streetcar Scene” (1945) shows a Black Boston Navy Yard worker sitting in uniform on the streetcar, surrounded by mostly White women, all of whom ignore him. He looks at the viewer, his hands folded over his lunch box, dignified yet reticent, and highly conscious that he is the lone Black passenger. He seems to know in this situation that he must prove that he is nonthreatening — his uniform and button establish that he is a gainfully employed, productive member of society — and not interact with the other passengers.Among the exhibition’s 100-plus works is a charcoal drawing of Martin Luther King Jr. The face is both idealized and weary, while the torso is schematic. The horizontal and vertical lines dividing the head and torso can be read as a sign of King’s martyrdom and as the crosshairs of the assassin’s rifle. Nearby is a commanding eight-foot bronze maquette of King’s head, which was modeled in 1982 and cast in 2021. Also on view are pages from Wilson’s sketchbooks, including works from Paris and Mexico City that show him absorbing lessons from Léger and the Mexican muralists. I see these pieces as integral to his commitment to portraying the daily life of Black people in the US — their aspirations and fears. Anyone would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by Wilson’s synthesis of empathy and artistic ambition. In the 2002 “Self-Portrait” and the lithograph “City Child (1965), Wilson, inspired by Ralph Ellison’s novel Invisible Man (1952), addresses the invisibility experienced in this country by people of color. In the prologue, Ellison writes: “I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.” In a country where the president demonizes immigrants and people of color, Wilson’s work reminds us that beauty, art, and politics don’t have to be divided, and the right to be seen should never be decided by others.John Wilson and James Stroud, Center Street Studio, \"Martin Luther King Jr.\" (2002), etching and aquatint on chine collé; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson continues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1000 Fifth Avenue, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through February 8.

(photo by Brontë Wittpenn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\n    \n        \n            This week San Francisco’s California College of the Arts (CCA) announced plans to close by the end of the 2026-2027 school year. CCA’s campus will then be owned by Vanderbilt University.Citing CCA’s long-standing financial struggles, including “demographic shifts and a persistent structural deficit,” CCA President David C. Howse called the plan “a decisive act of stewardship.” Deficits? How can this be? San Francisco is dense with millionaires. It frequently boasts the highest number of billionaires anywhere. How does one of the wealthiest cities in the world lose its last and oldest progressive art school? Intentionally. I taught at a variety of Bay Area art schools including CCA prior to moving to the DC area in 2019. I was appointed Scholar in Residence at CCA’s Center for Art + Public Life from 2015 to 2017. Art and activism have been the focus of my work for years.CCA students in the author's summer intensive, Art & The City, visiting Transamerica Redwood Park, one of San Francisco's oldest Privately Owned Publicly Open Spaces (photo by and courtesy Christian L. Frock) I first wrote about San Francisco’s wealth disparity and artists’ exodus for KQED in 2014. The art scene has always struggled to attract technology wealth, and today’s crypto kings have yet to emerge as philanthropists defending the arts or freedom of expression.The loss of CCA should be considered in relation to staggering wealth disparities and lack of social investment, primarily perpetuated by the technology sector, much of which has tight alliances with today’s leadership in Washington, DC. The indifference of wealth that has long-vexed San Francisco is now a systemic threat to the national ecosystem. These connections are evident in sweeping changes aimed at dismantling the social safety net and the cultural landscape. Last year, when funding was slashed for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the domino effect decimated initiatives across the country. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolved recently and the fate of PBS and NPR now hangs in the balance. Take note of who suffers the impact from these losses — working-class people of all stripes, children, veterans, people with disabilities, marginalized and vulnerable communities. The list goes on, and it doesn’t include oligarchs.  While it is difficult to track daily pronouncements from Washington, DC, aimed at limiting freedom of expression, the relative silence of the technology sector in the face of these changes is equally alarming, particularly given its supposed values in creativity, experimentation, and innovation. Meanwhile, most influential technology headquarters are furnished with amazing private art collections that rival those of public museums.As San Francisco’s last remaining and oldest private arts and design school — CCA will be 120 years old when it sunsets — the institution has been an essential stakeholder in art history and American history by extension. I spoke with Shalini Agrawal, my former director at CCA’s Center for Art + Public Life, to ask for her thoughts. Previously Associate Professor in Critical Ethnic Studies and Interdisciplinary Studies, with a 17-year track record at CCA, Professor Agrawal considered the losses and the possibilities that might be left open.CCA students from Art & The City, a summer intensive taught by the author, visiting one of the city's then-newest Privately Owned Publicly Open Spaces in the LinkedIn HQ, featuring several large-scale Frank Stella artworks, in 2016 (photo by and courtesy Christian L. Frock) “CCA would always bring in the most progressive artists and thinkers in the departments I worked in … There was just a lot of excitement in bringing in different thinkers,” she told me. “The Bay Area has always been a nexus for creative thinking and social justice. As creative thinkers, we also solve hard problems — I hope something [new] will emerge from this … perhaps something grassroots.” In West Coast art school parlance, the grassroots are the gold standard for excellence — and historically speaking, community organizing at the grassroots level has been essential to bringing about change in the United States. Barack Obama’s candidacy for presidency was secured by $5 campaign fundraisers early on. Grassroots action brought about change, and it can again. 2028 is on the horizon.CCA’s absence will have a wide-reaching impact that will be hard to quantify. What calculations can be made to demonstrate a loss of imagination? CCA always attracted local, national, and international students — and teaching is like scattering seeds on the wind, knowing art and ideas can take root anywhere. My students were frequently engaged in social justice issues, deeply invested in diversity, equity, and inclusion, and always focused on building community. CCA’s legacy contains scores of talented creatives, all wildly dangerous to the status quo for their ability to imagine a more expansive future.Students enrolled in New Media and Cultural Memory at CCA, a course taught by the author, visiting San Francisco's recently debuted Comfort Women Memorial in fall 2017 (photo by and courtesy Christian L. Frock) Artist and CCA Professor Emeritus Chris Johnson is set to retire this year after 48 years of teaching at the college, dating to when it was called California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC). “I was preparing for what I assumed would probably be my last undergraduate class,” he posted on Facebook. “It’s just that I thought that the school would always be there, with all of the inspiring growth it provided. It’s all of those meaningful conversations and moments of encouragement and insight that will be missed.” After noting CCA’s plans for students who will graduate next year, Johnson added, “After that we will all have to come to terms with the vast changes in what it means to study art in Northern California.” The lack of support that has resulted in CCA’s closure feels like a betrayal perpetuated by the San Francisco Bay Area’s wealthiest residents, who may also be party to the battle for democratic values unfolding before us today, but I trust the college’s past and present communities will make good on the grassroots promise that remains in San Francisco. The names on the walls might change, but I still believe in artists, and I’ll never give up on the West Coast. Si se puede, as we learn to say in school. American labor leader and feminist activist Dolores Huerta said it first, President Barack Obama said it last, and I’ll say it again — yes, we can.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        California College of the Arts\n                      \n                      \n                        San Francisco\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Highsmith/Buyenlarge/Getty Images)\n    \n        \n            Washington, DC — Last month, DC-based artist Nia Keturah Calhoun waited in line inside the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in the city’s downtown. She stared up at the 56-by-7-foot-tall mural by Don Miller. Calhoun, best known for her mural of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on 14th and S Streets NW, admired the piece while others passed by without a glance. “Murals can be markers of time and significance,” Calhoun told Hyperallergic. “People live their lives by it and associate with their surroundings. I think everyday reminders of sacrifice and triumph are important. Painting political figures puts them in the place of people's minds and physical space.”This Martin Luther King Jr. Day will mark the 40th anniversary of the “King Mural” unveiling. The work was preserved and restored to the library during massive renovations between 2017 and 2021. Since 1986, the painting has served as a visual portal into Martin Luther King Jr.’s life, painstakingly detailing a timeline from King’s childhood until his assassination in 1968. Depictions include King graduating from Morehouse College, King behind bars with Ralph Abernathy, leading a march, and speaking to a crowd with the Washington Monument in the background as a nod to his “I Have a Dream” speech. A woman stands next to Don Miller's Martin Luther King Jr. mural in progress (photo courtesy The People's Archive, DC Public Library)While the piece is dedicated to King, the mural honors other Civil Rights key figures, highlighting the often-overlooked leaders of the movement. The center of the mural is split. The right-center side shows a portrait of King, while the left-center depicts Southern Christian Leadership Conference leaders Andrew Young, Dorothy Cotton, Wyatt Tee Walker, Joseph E. Lowery, Septima P. Clark, Bayard Rustin, and Ella Baker speaking with King. Rosa Parks is prominently painted sitting on a Montgomery bus defying the segregation bus ordinance, which led to the 381-day bus boycott in 1955 and helped launch King as a significant leader in the movement. Several Civil Rights activists and the four girls killed in the 1963 Klan bombing of a church in Alabama are also memorialized with portraits.On Monday, January 19, the Library will host a special program dedicated to the mural and MLK Day, featuring a musical performance by the Seasons of Love Ensemble of the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington and remarks from members of Miller’s family.According to the DC Public Library, Miller originally proposed the mural after visiting the library in the early 1980s and seeing lots of empty wall space. The Jamaican-born, New Jersey-raised WWII vet dedicated his art practice to honoring and documenting Black history. He saw the opportunity for a grand visual piece honoring the man the library was named after. Installation of Martin Luther King Jr. Mural inside Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library (photo courtesy The People's Archive, DC Public Library)His proposal was approved in 1984. Miller then spent two years researching and creating the painting, talking with multiple civil rights leaders and surviving family members to get all the details right, like the exact bus route name from Parks when she visited Miller at his studio in Montclair. The Washington Post in 1986 reported that Miller slept in King’s former bed in Montgomery, Alabama, when visiting for research.DC-based artist Nekisha Durrett can relate to Miller’s art ethos. Raised in Southern Maryland outside of DC, she was raised not far from where Harriet Tubman grew up, but did not learn this fact until near adulthood. The absence of this knowledge from her childhood education fueled Durrett, a former educator, to create art to highlight forgotten Black history. Tubman has frequently been a muse for Durrett. Her latest piece, “The Hem of Heaven,” a 20-foot sculpture of Tubman’s shawl, will be unveiled at the Obama Presidential Center Library this year.Nekisha Durrett working on \"The Hem of Heaven\" for the Harriet Tubman Courtyard (photo courtesy Nekisha Durrett)Durrett emphasized the importance of creating art in public spaces. “It’s the democratization of space,” Durrett told Hyperallergic. “Not everyone feels necessarily comfortable going into a museum, and I love that public space is just so accessible for everyone.”After Miller passed in 1993 at the age of 69, his wife, Judith Miller, hosted a posthumous gallery exhibition honoring her husband in 1998, where she wrote in a pamphlet, “Don's dream was an artist's dream — that their work would continue to influence, inspire, and in his case instruct, long after they have departed.” Miller’s impact with “King Mural” on audiences — from the local artists who appreciate it to the library-goers who encounter it as a constant presence — proves that his dream has been fulfilled. \n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Martin Luther King Jr\n                      \n                      \n                        Washington DC\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            Sometimes you wake up to news headlines that don't make any sense. Take this one, for example: South Africa Axes Venice Biennale Proposal Centering Gaza Victims. You ask yourself: Wait a second, isn't South Africa the same country that accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice? Yes, it is, but it happens to have a right-wing arts and culture minister who found artist Gabrielle Goliath’s performance piece “highly divisive in nature.” He later came up with the bizarre, unfounded claim that a “foreign power” was involved in the artwork. Writer and scholar Christina Sharpe and University of Buffalo professor Rinaldo Walcott saw this and felt an immediate urge to respond. In a must-read piece this week, they lament a world in which the country that toppled Apartheid abandons its own revolutionary legacy. Meanwhile, the White House brings the Smithsonian to its knees, forcing the DC institution to submit all information — down to wall-label texts — about its programming to make sure it aligns with the president's worldview.

    "body": "\n\tA French court ordered the high-profile Galerie Kraemer in Paris to return €2.8 million (around $3.25 million) to collector Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani over questions about a Chinese vase. The decision follows eight years of legal wrangling over the date attributed to the piece.\n\n\tAs reported by the Art Newspaper, the Paris court of appeal sided with the collector, a cousin of the Emir of Qatar, “because of ‘serious doubts’ about the 18th-century dating of the gilded bronze mounts of the porcelain vase.”\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe vase sold for €815 ($945) in Brazil 20 years ago, according to investigators cited by TAN, and then passed through a Paris flea market and three antique dealers before being purchased by Laurent Kraemer for €180,000 ($208,750).\n\t\n\n\tBut after Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani bought the vase in 2012, he had it examined in the wake of questions raised after “Galerie Kraemer was embroiled in several fake furniture cases (including one involving counterfeit royal chairs sold to the same collector, for which the gallery was acquitted of deception by gross negligence; it denies wrongdoing in the others).”\n\n\tExpert Sébastien Evain deemed the vase’s dating “highly improbable,” and two others said it “could not have been mounted in the 18th century.” \n\n\t“But an expert commissioned by the gallery, Gilles Perrault, who did not see the object in person, countered these claims,” according to TAN. “After analyzing Evain’s report and viewing 76 photographs of the bronze mounts, he concluded it was ‘certainly an 18th-century manufacture.’ His opinion was supported by another expert, Guy Kalfon, who also only saw photographs.”\n\n\tA court rejected Sheikh Hamad’s claim in 2021, but more conflicting opinions arose. Then the most recent ruling was issued, as TAN reports: “The court of appeal ruled that ‘meticulous examinations by competent specialists,’ who examined the work by sight, raised ‘serious doubts.’ This was sufficient for the court to annul the sale, even though the creation date could not be ascertained.”\n\n\tThe lawyer for Galerie Kraemer, which plans to appeal the ruling, expressed disappointment with the decision and said: “All dealers should be concerned that it only takes a couple of experts to raise doubts about dates to cancel the sale of such a marvelous object.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tJoseph Atsus, a 51-year-old Pennsylvania man, was sentenced on Tuesday to 48 months in prison, a term of supervised release, and $1 million in restitution for several charges related to his participation in a notorious museum theft ring, the Department of Justice announced earlier this week.\n\n\tAtsus was part of a eight-person ring that stole millions in art and memorabilia between 1999 and 2019 from 20 museums, institutions, and stores across six states and Washington, D.C.\n\n\tAmong the most valuable pieces stolen were Andy Warhol’s silkscreen work Le Grande Passion (1984) and Jackson Pollock’s oil painting Springs Winter (1949) from the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 2005. In addition, the group stole antique firearms, gold nuggets, and nine World Series rings, seven championship and other rings, and two MVP plaques, all belonging to New York Yankees legend Yogi Berra, from the Yogi Berra Museum & Learning Center located in Little Falls, New Jersey.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tAtsus is the sixth member of the ring to be sentenced. Co-conspirator Nicholas Dombek, 55, was sentenced last month to 108 months imprisonment, while Damien Boland, 50, is awaiting sentencing. Four others pled guilty and were sentenced last year, with sentences ranging from six months to 96 months imprisonment. \n\n\tThe whereabouts of many of the stolen works in unknown. In at least one case, Dombek burned a painting valued at $125,000 to avoid it being recovered as evidence and used in the case.  The Berra rings, according to the prosecution, were melted down and sold for just $12,000.\n\n\tWhile prosecutors were seeking eight years for Atsus, his ex-wife and mother pleaded for a more lenient sentence due to his 11-year-old autistic son’s high needs.\n\n\t“They have [poured] their lives into [the son’s] care. It requires every bit of energy,” Oralia Iniguez, Atsus’s mother, told the court. \n\n\tU.S. District Judge Malachy E. Mannion was moved by the plea; he explicitly told Atsus that he reduced his sentence for the sake of his child. “I’m not doing this for you. I’m doing this for him,” the judge said, according to WVIA, a Scranton public media organization.\n",

    "body": "\n\tin Books, Comics/Cartoons, Film, Law, Music |   \tJanuary 1st, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough it isn’t the kind of thing one hears dis­cussed every day, seri­ous Dis­ney fans do tend to know that Goofy’s orig­i­nal name was Dip­py Dawg. But how many of the non-obses­sive know that Mick­ey’s faith­ful pet Plu­to was first called Rover? (We pass over in dig­ni­fied silence the qua­si-philo­soph­i­cal ques­tion of why the for­mer dog is humanoid and the lat­ter isn’t.) It is Rover, as dis­tinct from Plu­to, who pass­es into the pub­lic domain this new year, one of a cast of now-lib­er­at­ed char­ac­ters includ­ing Blondie and Dag­wood as well as Bet­ty Boop — who, upon mak­ing her debut in Fleis­ch­er Stu­dios’ Dizzy Dish­es of 1930, has a some­what canoid appear­ance her­self. You can see them all in the video above from Duke Uni­ver­si­ty’s Cen­ter for the Study of the Pub­lic Domain, with much more infor­ma­tion avail­able in their blog post mark­ing this year’s “Pub­lic Domain Day.”\nThe year 1930, write the Cen­ter’s Jen­nifer Jenk­ins and James Boyle, was one “of detec­tives, jazz, speakeasies, and icon­ic char­ac­ters step­ping onto the cul­tur­al stage — many of whom have been locked behind copy­right for near­ly a cen­tu­ry.”\nNov­els that come avail­able this year include William Faulkn­er’s As I Lay Dying, Dashiell Ham­met­t’s The Mal­tese Fal­con, and Agatha Christie’s The Mur­der at the Vic­arage; among the films are Lewis Mile­stone’s Best Pic­ture-win­ning All Qui­et on the West­ern Front, Vic­tor Heer­man’s Marx Broth­ers pic­ture Ani­mal Crack­ers, and Luis Buñuel and Sal­vador Dalí’s L’Âge d’Or. In music, com­po­si­tions like “I Got Rhythm” and “Embrace­able You” by the Gersh­win Broth­ers as well as record­ings like “Nobody Knows the Trou­ble I’ve Seen” by Mar­i­an Ander­son and “Sweet Geor­gia Brown” by Ben Bernie and His Hotel Roo­sevelt Orches­tra have also, at long last, gone pub­lic.\nReflec­tion on some of these works them­selves sug­gests some­thing about the impor­tance of the pub­lic domain. With the title of Cakes and Ale, anoth­er book in this year’s crop, Som­er­set Maugh­am makes ref­er­ence to “a clas­sic pub­lic domain work, in this case Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night”; so, for that mat­ter, does Faulkn­er, giv­en that the line “as I lay dying” comes from the Odyssey. “To tell new sto­ries, we draw from old­er ones,” write Jenk­ins and Boyle. “One work of art inspires anoth­er — that is how the pub­lic domain feeds cre­ativ­i­ty.” Today, we’re free to take explic­it inspi­ra­tion for our own work from Nan­cy Drew, “Just a Gigo­lo,” Blondie, Mon­dri­an’s Com­po­si­tion with Red, Blue, and Yel­low, Hitch­cock­’s Mur­der!, and much else besides. And by all means use Rover, but if you also want to bring in Dip­py Dawg, you’re going to have to wait until 2028.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWhat’s Enter­ing the Pub­lic Domain in 2025: Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms, Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury, Ear­ly Hitch­cock Films, Tintin and Pop­eye Car­toons & More\nThe Harlem Jazz Singer Who Inspired Bet­ty Boop: Meet the Orig­i­nal Boop-Oop-a-Doop, “Baby Esther”\nCar­toon­ists Draw Their Famous Car­toon Char­ac­ters While Blind­fold­ed (1947)\nWatch Restored Ver­sions of Clas­sic Fleis­ch­er Car­toons on Youtube, Fea­tur­ing Bet­ty Boop, Koko the Clown & Oth­ers\nVin­tage Audio: William Faulkn­er Reads From As I Lay Dying\n16 Free Hitch­cock Movies Online\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tDecember 31st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt would­n’t sur­prise us to come across a Japan­ese per­son in Venice. Indeed, giv­en the glob­al touris­tic appeal of the place, we could hard­ly imag­ine a day there with­out a vis­i­tor from the Land of the Ris­ing Sun. But things were dif­fer­ent in 1873, just five years after the end of the sakoku pol­i­cy that all but closed Japan to the world for two and a half cen­turies. On a mis­sion to research the mod­ern ways of the new­ly acces­si­ble out­side world, a Japan­ese del­e­ga­tion arrived in Venice and found in the state archives two let­ters writ­ten in Latin by one of their coun­try­men, dat­ed 1615 and 1616. Its author seemed to have been an emis­sary of Ōto­mo Sōrin, a feu­dal lord who con­vert­ed to Chris­tian­i­ty and once sent a mis­sion of four teenagers to meet the Pope in Rome — a mis­sion that took place ear­li­er, in 1586.\nSo who could this undoc­u­ment­ed Japan­ese trav­el­er in the fif­teen-tens have been? That ques­tion lies at the heart of the sto­ry told by Evan “Nerd­writer” Puschak in his new video above. The let­ter’s sig­na­ture of Haseku­ra Roke­mon would’ve con­sti­tut­ed a major clue, but the name seems not to have rung a bell with any­one at the time.\n“In 1873, there was like­ly no one on plan­et Earth who knew why Haseku­ra Roke­mon was in Venice in 1615,” says Puschak. The rea­sons have to do with the arrival of Chris­tian­i­ty in Japan — or at least the arrival of the first major Jesuit mis­sion­ary — in 1549. Not every ruler looked kind­ly on their work, and espe­cial­ly not Toy­oto­mi Hideyoshi, who ordered them removed from the coun­try in 1587 and lat­er had 26 Catholics cru­ci­fied in Nagasa­ki.\nHideyoshi was suc­ceed­ed by the more tol­er­ant Toku­gawa Ieya­su (1543–1616), dur­ing whose rule the Japan­ese-speak­ing Fran­cis­can fri­ar Luis Sote­lo arrived in Japan. Over the ensu­ing decade, he worked not just to spread his faith but also to build hos­pi­tals, one of which suc­cess­ful­ly treat­ed a Euro­pean con­cu­bine of the feu­dal lord Date Masamune. The two men got on, real­iz­ing the mutu­al ben­e­fit their rela­tion­ship could bring: per­haps Sote­lo could found a new dio­cese in Date’s north­ern ter­ri­to­ry, and per­haps Date could estab­lish links with the Span­ish empire. In order to accom­plish the lat­ter, he had a ship built and a team assem­bled for a mis­sion to Europe, includ­ing Sote­lo him­self. He sent with them a loy­al retain­er, a samu­rai by the name of Haseku­ra Roke­mon — or to use his full name, Haseku­ra Rokue­mon Tsune­na­ga, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture for his meet­ing with the pope and adop­tion of Roman cit­i­zen­ship. He may have been Japan­ese, but a mere tourist he cer­tain­ly was­n’t.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe 17th Cen­tu­ry Japan­ese Samu­rai Who Sailed to Europe, Met the Pope & Became a Roman Cit­i­zen\n21 Rules for Liv­ing from Miyamo­to Musashi, Japan’s Samu­rai Philoso­pher (1584–1645)\nA Mis­chie­vous Samu­rai Describes His Rough-and-Tum­ble Life in 19th Cen­tu­ry Japan\nHow to Be a Samu­rai: A 17th Cen­tu­ry Code for Life & War\nHand-Col­ored 1860s Pho­tographs Reveal the Last Days of Samu­rai Japan\nMeet Yasuke, Japan’s First Black Samu­rai War­rior\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as industrialization swelled and advances in science and health paralleled social and economic transformation, artists searched for ways to express the changing times. Fatigued with the traditions and values of conservative society, which increasingly felt at odds with the way the world was heading, artists began to seek new visual languages in painting, architecture, and design.\nWhat started as dalliances with non-academic painting in the late 1800s—think Vincent van Gogh and the Impressionists—burgeoned into a full-throttle movement, especially after World War I. Kasimir Malevich’s “Black Square” (1913), for one, marked a turning point in Western art when he broke down the boundary between representation and abstraction—it’s thought to be the first time an artist made a work that wasn’t of something. After World War II, modernism took off, and its influence on art continues to resonate around the globe.\nYayanagi Go (Tsuyoshi), “Flower Like the Blue Sky” (1982), silkscreen print, 15 1/2 × 15 1/2 inches. © Tsuyoshi (Go) Yayanagi. Image courtesy of Kumo Arts\nDuring the early-to-mid-20th century in Japan, creatives and tastemakers looked to both their own traditions, such as the rich legacy of ukiyo-e, and to the West. Forthcoming from Penguin Random House, Modern Japanese Printmakers: New Waves and Eruptions celebrates the trailblazing artists who innovated unique techniques, merged traditional mediums with new methods, and reveled in experimentation.\nAs Japan’s consumer culture blossomed in the early 20th century, and society adopted technologies and pop culture influences from abroad, artists also embraced modernity. Takea Hideo, for example, reimagines ukiyo-e imagery into surreal, dreamlike tableaux. And Funsaka Yoshiuke creates playful chromatic experiments using repeated motifs like lemons, black dots, grids, and multi-hued strips of color.\nAuthored by Malene Wagner, the volume covers the gamut of printmaking techniques, from woodblock and lithograph to silkscreen and monoprints, illuminating the virtually endless ways artists can translate imagery onto paper.\nModern Japanese Printmakers contains more than 100 full-page images and highlights a wide range of practices, from Ay-O’s explosively vibrant, psychedelic compositions to Ruth Asawa’s lithographs exploring the relationship between nature and geometry. Slated for release on January 13, the book is available for pre-order now on Bookshop.\nRuth Asawa, “Dessert Plant (TAM.1460)” (1965), lithograph. © 2025 Ruth Asawa Lanier, Inc., courtesy of David Zwirner\nTakea Hideo, “The Heike Clan’s Capital” from the series ‘Genpei’ (1985-99), silkscreen print, 20 3/4 × 15 1/2 inches. © Hideo Takeda\nYoshida Hodaka, “Mambo” (1956), monoprint, 32 3/4 × 46 1/2 inches. © Ayomi Yoshida\nAy-O, “Well!

His shows in the city drew an estimated half-million visitors to the GNP Seguros Stadium while right-wing backlash continues in the US against the artist, who is also a vocal advocate of immigration rights.

Her practice, which spans drawing, embroidery, engraving, printmaking, collage, sculpture, and installation, explores the history of racial violence and the persisting legacy of slavery in Brazil, illuminating the impact of memory on psychosocial constructions. Through archetypes and documents, Paulino blends personal and archival recollections to deconstruct those remnants of European colonialism influencing the cultural consciousness today.This year’s committee of nominators included Beverly Adams, Johnny Gandelsman, Tina Kukielski, Helen Molesworth, and James Oles, who selected Paulino after a thorough search process across diverse creative disciplines.“Rosana Paulino’s selection as the 2025 BMC Prize recipient extends Black Mountain College’s radical experiment across continents, recognizing a practice that, like the College itself, resists easy categories and sees art as a tool for inquiry, responsibility, and change. Paulino’s work resonates with the College’s enduring commitment to social engagement and transformative interdisciplinarity,” said Jeff Arnal, Executive Director of Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center.Origins of the PrizeThe legendary Black Mountain College (1933–1957) was founded on principles of collaboration, experimentation, and non-hierarchical, democratic structures — preparing individuals to become active citizens. The college’s impact has taken root across the globe, evolving to encompass diverse forms of expression. Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center is dedicated to preserving and extending the BMC legacy. The museum’s BMC Prize was established by cultural pollinators Hedy Fischer and Randy Shull to support the most innovative artists working in the BMC tradition today.To learn more, visit blackmountaincollege.org.\n                  \n                      \n                        Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Awards\n                      \n                      \n                        Sponsored\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Giménez had been living in a nursing home in Borja, according to the publication. In 2012, with permission from a local priest at the Santuario de Misericordia church, Giménez attempted to restore a fresco depicting Jesus Christ painted by Elías García Martínez titled “Ecce Homo.” The result of Giménez’s work, a cartoonish distortion of the faded original, was initially considered to be a failure. Upon completion, town officials initially suspected the fresco had been vandalized and reportedly considered taking legal action against the artist.But any contempt toward Giménez quickly faded when the image began circulating online, delighting netizens who saw it less as a botched restoration than as an original artwork in its own right. The work brought an onslaught of new visitors to her tiny town of nearly 5,000, and according to reporting by the New York Times, the wave of tourism “stabilized the town’s restaurant industry.” By 2016, the church's souvenir shop sold merchandise, including pillows and mugs, decorated with the distorted “Monkey Christ” or “Beast Jesus” face. The charming restoration also inspired an opera recounting the saga, Halloween costumes, and countless memes.Born in 1931, Giménez started painting in her free time. According to a wall text at the church, which describes the chaotic fresco, Giménez had previously painted mostly landscapes and performed “pictorial retouches” at religious buildings. She worked in a local bar and supported two sons, both of whom received their first communion at the church that houses the now-famous work. In a statement, the Borja City Council characterized Giménez as “kind and compassionate.” “She leaves behind the legacy of a strong woman, a devoted mother, a deeply resilient fighter who faced tough challenges throughout her life with truly admirable sacrifice, courage, and determination,” the statement said. The news of Giménez's passing has prompted a wave of online tributes from around the world, another testament to the impact she had on people from all walks of life.“Goodbye, cosmic kite, immortal goddess, spiritual guide, artistic icon,” wrote the Argentine artist Fernanda Laguna on Instagram. “I love you to infinity and beyond.”\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Obituaries\n                      \n                      \n                        Beast Jesus\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

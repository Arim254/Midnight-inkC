    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tNovember 14th, 2025  4 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEvery­one in ancient Rome wore togas, sur­round­ed them­selves with pure-white mar­ble stat­ues, bayed for blood as glad­i­a­tors fought to the death in the Colos­se­um, pro­gram­mat­i­cal­ly imi­tat­ed the Greeks, and, after each and every debauch­er­ous feast, excused them­selves to the vom­i­to­ria, where they rit­u­al­ly vacat­ed their stom­achs. Or at least that’s the pic­ture any of us here in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry might piece togeth­er out of the impres­sions we hap­pen to receive from a steady flow of sword-and-san­dals movies and TV shows — not to men­tion the count­less ref­er­ences that pop­u­lar cul­ture makes to the Roman Empire, which inevitably make their way into the con­scious­ness even of those of us who don’t think about it every day.\nIn the new, almost 80-minute Big Think inter­view above, Mary Beard explains some of the ways in which we’ve been “pic­tur­ing ancient Rome all wrong.” The ancient Romans lived in a world in which men kissed each oth­er as a stan­dard greet­ing (at least until a mas­sive out­break of her­pes put a stop to it it), stat­u­ary was paint­ed in all man­ner of gar­ish col­ors (though just how gar­ish remains a mat­ter of schol­ar­ly inquiry), cit­i­zens rich enough to wear togas need­ed the assis­tance of slaves even to get dressed in the morn­ing, and Greece took cul­tur­al influ­ence as well as gave it. These may not yet be fea­tures of the Rome we imag­ine, but they could be if we make a habit of lis­ten­ing to Beard’s new pod­cast Instant Clas­sics.\nWhat­ev­er lib­er­ties they take, the depic­tions of the Roman Empire that enter­tain us today also remind us that, as Beard puts it, “Rome has nev­er gone away in the mod­ern world.” Nowhere is that clear­er than in ever-more-fre­quent dis­cus­sions about the fate of mod­ern glob­al pow­ers. If we look at our sur­round­ings and see Rome, per­haps that’s because the Eter­nal City has “giv­en us an image of what it is to be pow­er­ful, what it is to be larg­er than life, what it is to be fun­ny, what it is to be an empire, so it’s pro­vid­ed many of the build­ing blocks we need to think about our­selves.” Even if we’re not the mod­ern equiv­a­lents of Augus­tus, Vir­gil, Cicero, or even Nero — to name a few of the Romans Beard name as, for bet­ter or worse, the most impor­tant — we could all stand to make our image of Roman life a lit­tle more real­is­tic.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEmpire With­out Lim­it: Watch Mary Beard’s TV Series on Ancient Rome\nMythol­o­gy Expert Reviews Depic­tions of Greek & Roman Myths in Pop­u­lar Movies and TV Shows\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nJoy Machine is excited to present General Strike, an exhibition of 70+ matchboxes, opening on November 21 in Chicago. \nWhat does solidarity mean for the artist? Or, what can art do in a time of crisis? The concept of a general strike is appealing to many advocates and activists because, in the face of oppression or inequality, it’s one of the few options available to the general public. General strikes are sometimes thought of as the “people’s veto,” and for the un-unionized among us, are less about joining our colleagues on the picket lines and more a call for solidarity. They ask us to pinpoint our strengths and identify how our skills can best be of use. \nChristina Keith\nWriting about the need and dream of solidarity, activist and novelist Sarah Schulman describes recognition, risk, and creativity as the essential tools in harnessing “the people power necessary to reach the tipping point that transforms lives and, in the most extreme conditions of brutality, actually saves lives.” For artists, these three tenets–recognition, risk, and creativity–are often already the building blocks of a practice. Discerning eyes and trenchant observations, personal sacrifices and provocative positions, combined with a wealth of imagination, are evident in both the studio and the streets. Artists are in many ways world-builders, helping to illuminate what’s previously gone unnoticed or otherwise been thought impossible.\nIn General Strike, we witness more than 70 approaches to a singular object: a large, wooden matchbox. Containing purple-tipped matchsticks, these vessels of potential display a wide array of mediums and methodologies offered by artists across North America. While some revel in whimsy, beauty, and the pleasures of life, others direct us toward bold, decisive action. All, in their own ways, speak to an innate impulse to transform something simple into another thing entirely.\nLike any crisis, whether tangible or of conscience, what’s required is a variety of responses, the best of which fan the flames of courage and ultimately insist on our shared humanity. The particularities of such approaches–and those stoking their creation–are what make this fight worthwhile, especially when we’re all striking together.\nA portion of the proceeds from all work sold in General Strike will be donated to the ACLU. RSVP to the opening reception.\nAndrew Hem\nBarry Hazard\nStevie Shao\nGraham Franciose\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLi Songsong (previously) has long centered his practice around translating archival imagery, whether it be a portrait printed in a newspaper or still from a film. The Chinese artist is broadly interested in the ways that memories morph over time and how, when we’re reflecting on a moment well in the past, our clarity over the particulars can be hazy.\nHis new body of work, History Painting, takes a similar technical approach, although rather than interpret a specific scene, Li ventures into the abstract. Wide, impasto layers of oil paint cloak the large-scale canvas, creating a cacophony of color and texture that seems to swell upward while simultaneously pulling downward. As a filmed studio visit shows, the artist works from top down, adding one thick mark atop another in a sort of grid. \n“History VII: Snake Year” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nPace Gallery, which represents Li, shares that History Painting reflects more on his relationship to the medium than any specific visual source, although, given his past work, it’s difficult not to try to find definition within the composition. The clustered ridges of paint, for example, might evoke bodies huddled together in mass, their backs to the viewer as they move toward an unknown destination. For Li, these brushstrokes, while abstract, do retain a sense of action and autonomy, and he describes them as “agentive and idiosyncratic” even as they’re covered again and again.\nHistory Painting is on view through December 20 in New York.\n“Revolution” (2025), oil on canvas, 210 x 210 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n“History IX: Mercy” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\n“History IV: Sacrifice” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for addressing issues of censorship and inequality, Iranian artist Arghavan Khosravi (previously) has long utilized her bold, fragmented works to confront large-scale problems relevant around the world. Her alluring color palettes and delicate motifs catch the eye and are paired with distinct symbols of tension: a chain lock, cords binding body parts, and roiling flames.\nWhile her concerns are global, Khosravi has always considered her practice somewhat of a balm that helps her cope with trying times. And so the inward turn of her latest body of work perhaps ventures farther into this territory as she allows herself to delve deep into a personal and collective subconscious.\n\nThe past year has engendered a period of introspection, which the artist translates into a collection of smaller, altar-esque pieces. She refers to them as “intimate constructions where interior space carries its own symbolism. It’s been a way to move inward for a moment, allowing ideas to surface without a predetermined destination.” \nBoth the subconscious and symbolic have long figured prominently in her work, and recent pieces are similar. Many layer seemingly disparate components into surreal scenes, with recurring imagery of long, flowing hair, bright orbs of light, birds, and patterns from historic Persian architecture and design. Whereas earlier works frequently incorporated windows, doorways, and other portal-like structures, Khosravi’s newer pieces peer outward from inside, inviting the viewer into a new realm.\nThe artist is in the early stages of preparing for an upcoming solo show at Uffner & Liu in New York next year. Until then, follow her practice on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAfter six momentous leaps from a small aircraft, skydiver Gabriel C. Brown completed his mission. Brown is friends with astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy and now, also one of his collaborators. Together, the pair created a stunning image that shows the adventurous subject falling in front of the sun.\nMcCarthy is known for his incredible patience and planning, which has led him to capture an array of striking photos and composites detailing cosmic phenomena. This most recent piece, titled “The Fall of Icarus,” details the roiling, fiery surface of the sun with his friend’s upside-down silhouette. The pair undertook this project this past weekend in Arizona.\n\nLike much of his work, this image is a composite that stitches together a collection of high-resolution captures. McCarthy and Brown had to coordinate the jump and subsequent shots to reveal the latter’s free fall, footage of which they share on Instagram. \n“The Fall of Icarus” is available as a limited-edition print in McCarthy’s shop, where you can find more of his work.

With exceptional opportunities for fellowships, awards, and summer stipends, the recently renamed Maria Manetti Shrem Art Studio MFA provides students with spacious private studios so they can thrive in a vibrant, creative community as they work closely with internationally renowned faculty and visiting artists. \nBecause UC Davis is a research university, MFA students have the opportunity to engage in intensive artistic work and interdisciplinary research while interacting with artists and scholars across campus. The program is committed to delivering an innovative educational curriculum to prepare graduates for professional public engagement in the arts, including arts education, exhibition and curatorial practices, and community-based work. The culmination of two years of study is presented in a thesis exhibition at the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum of Art. \nThree visiting artist programs offer students first-hand exposure to artists, critics, and curators of note: The California Studio, Betty Jean and Wayne Thiebaud Lecture, and Visiting Artist Lectures Series. A select list of recent speakers includes Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Cecilia Alemani, Xu Bing, Helen Molesworth, Wangechi Mutu, Tania Candiani, Raúl De Nieves, Latoya Ruby Frazier, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Kota Ezawa, Sky Hopinka, Amelia Jones, and Hito Steyerl, among other innovative artists.\nThe Maria Manetti Shrem Art Studio MFA Program provides substantial financial support through paid teaching assistant positions, awards, and fellowships. UC Davis partners with prestigious professional programs, including the Headlands Center for the Arts, the Dedalus Foundation, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, and Tropical Lab residency in Singapore. \nThe deadline to apply is January 5, 2026. Apply here.\nFor more information, visit arts.ucdavis.edu.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

Assistantships provide professional experience in teaching, gallery management, curatorial work, and program coordination, preparing students for the multifaceted realities of the art world.\nMFA candidates receive private studios and access to innovative facilities in the Windgate Art and Design District, including wood and metal shops, darkrooms, print and ceramics studios, fabrication labs, and on-campus galleries. Students work in a core area — ceramics, drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, or sculpture and experimental media — and are encouraged to explore across disciplines.\nThe graduate faculty embraces an interdisciplinary approach to artmaking in the 21st century. “Students enter the program with a focus on a specific medium and, because of how collaborative our program is, many find themselves working across disciplines in compelling ways by the time they reach their thesis exhibition,” said graduate program director Jody Travis Thompson.\nWhile some institutions have begun to phase out traditional processes like wet photography, analog printmaking, and metal casting, the School of Art has made a deliberate goal to maintain and invest in both historic and technologically advanced techniques. This dual emphasis reflects Northwest Arkansas’s history of artisanal skill and self-reliance, as well as the rapidly growing creative and tech industries in the region.\nThe MFA program also maintains partnerships and opportunities with Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, The Momentary, and Art Bridges, along with local galleries and artist-run spaces, connecting students directly to the art ecosystem.\n“Northwest Arkansas is rapidly growing and primed for creative exploration, experimentation, and collaboration,” said Adam Hogan, studio art program co-director. “Our students are an important part of this thriving ecosystem, one where the lines between world-class institutions, artists-run spaces, ad hoc experimental projects, laboratories, startups, and studios are wonderfully blurred. The partnerships we’ve built give graduate students real opportunities both inside and outside of our walls.”\nThese opportunities are bolstered by transformational support from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation and the Windgate Foundation, which help fund travel grants, summer assistantships, and research fellowships.\n“Our program is about giving artists the time, resources, and critical dialogue they need to push their work,” said Rebecca Drolen, studio art program co-director. “With robust support and resources, we want our students to feel the freedom to take risks in their practice, which in turn prepares them to shape the field in innovative ways.”\nApplications to the MFA in Studio Art require a portfolio of 20 recent works, artist and personal statements, a CV, transcripts, and three letters of recommendation submitted via SlideRoom. The application deadline is January 15, 2026.\nTo learn more, visit art.uark.edu or contact graduate program director Jody Travis Thompson at jtt005@uark.edu.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

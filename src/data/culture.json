Like fel­low L.A. punks <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/tYhgcH7yrVc\">the Germs</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/sDwcHUeG6Nc?si=v7udgf2sVhlYpTs-\">Cir­cle Jerks</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/ECSakWxQCCc?si=Wj-txmVfAI5UFA2N\">Black Flag</a>, Fear gets cred­it for pio­neer­ing a Cal­i­for­nia punk sound known for ado­les­cent brat­ti­ness and a total lack of pre­ten­sion to any kind of art­ful­ness or cool.</p>\n<p>Like many of their peers, Fear rose to promi­nence when Pene­lope Spheeris fea­tured them in her 1981 punk doc­u­men­tary <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amzn.to/1NYjwcl\">The Decline of West­ern Civ­i­liza­tion, Part I</a></em>. But before that sem­i­nal film’s release, Fear was dis­cov­ered by John Belushi, who first caught the band on a local L.A. music show called <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dangerousminds.net/comments/all_25_episodes_of_new_wave_theatre_are_online\">New Wave The­atre</a></em> in 1980. He tracked down Ving, who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-john-belushis-long-lost-punk-song-with-fear-20150910\">tells <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, “we had a cou­ple of beers and became fast friends.” At the time, Belushi was at work on his com­e­dy <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://screencrush.com/the-other-neighbors-belushi-aykroyd/\">Neigh­bors</a></em> with Dan Aykroyd and con­tract­ed the band to record a song for the film (his last before his death in 1982).</p>\n<p>The film’s pro­duc­ers, <em>Rolling Stone</em> writes, “were appalled” by the song “and refused to use it,” so to make it up to Ving and com­pa­ny, Belushi pushed to have the band booked on <em>Sat­ur­day Night Live</em> on Hal­loween, 1981. The result­ing per­for­mance has become leg­endary for what hap­pened, and what didn’t, and led to Fear becom­ing, says Ving, “one of the esteemed mem­bers of the per­ma­nent­ly banned.” You can watch a clip above of the band play­ing “Beef Boloney” and “New York’s Alright if You Like Sax­o­phones” (intro­duced by Don­ald Pleas­ance), and just below see Ving in a clip from an inter­view show dis­cussing the ill-fat­ed gig.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UqCxyC5QQBA?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Belushi stage-man­aged the band’s appear­ance, striv­ing for authen­tic­i­ty by bring­ing into the stu­dio what Ving calls “an actu­al punk rock audi­ence rather than just Mr. and Mrs. Mis­souri.” (That audi­ence includ­ed now-leg­ends Ian MacK­aye of Minor Threat and Fugazi, mem­bers of New York hard­core band the Cro-Mags, and Tesco Vee of the Meat­men.)  The result­ing mosh pit was noth­ing out of the ordi­nary for the typ­i­cal punk show. But, unsur­pris­ing­ly, “the real audi­ence at <em>Sat­ur­day Night Live</em> was scared to death,” says Ving, “They didn’t know what was hap­pen­ing with all the may­hem.”</p>\n<p>Dur­ing the riotous pro­ceed­ings, <em>SNL</em> pro­duc­er Dick Eber­sol “got hit in the chest with a pump­kin,” some equip­ment was dam­aged, and dur­ing the final song, “Let’s Have a War,” an audi­ence mem­ber grabbed the micro­phone and yelled out “F*ck New York!” The pro­fan­i­ty freaked out NBC, who cut the broad­cast short and shelved the footage for sev­er­al years. The <em>New York Post</em> lat­er quot­ed an unnamed NBC tech­ni­cian as say­ing, “This was a life-threat­en­ing sit­u­a­tion. They went crazy. It’s amaz­ing no one got killed.” The paper also quot­ed a fig­ure of $400,000 for dam­ages to the Rock­e­feller Cen­ter set.</p>\n<p>But as <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9yQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT14&ots=n8hOHBJ1Mg&dq=NY%20Post%20SNL%20Riot%20Fear&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false\">Bill­board </a></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9yQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT14&ots=n8hOHBJ1Mg&dq=NY%20Post%20SNL%20Riot%20Fear&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false\">report­ed two weeks lat­er</a>, the fig­ure was total­ly erro­neous (sup­plied to the <em>Post</em> by Ving as a prac­ti­cal joke, as he says above). “We had to pay $40 in labor penal­ties. That was the extent of it,” said <em>SNL</em> spokesman Peter Hamil­ton. As for the shock to view­ers, it seems the net­work received “all of 12 com­plaints” after the broad­cast. Ving him­self found the over­re­ac­tion ridicu­lous, and NBC’s long shelv­ing of the footage—only recent­ly made avail­able in a trun­cat­ed version—a humor­less mis­take. “They seem to be… los­ing the sense of humor about the whole idea,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “I had a sense of humor at the whole idea of start­ing Fear. It was extreme­ly humor­ous to me, and I think John saw that humor.”</p>\n<p>Indeed he did, but Belushi’s appre­ci­a­tion for Fear’s antics was ahead of its time. Now we can see, at least in part, what all the fuss was about. And we can also final­ly hear the long-shelved sin­gle for <em>Neigh­bors</em> that Belushi record­ed with the band.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/q55wNcD-Haw?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Stunt That Got Elvis Costello Banned From <i>Saturday Night Live</i> (1977)\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/09/the-stunt-that-got-elvis-costello-banned-from-saturday-night-live.html\">The Stunt That Got Elvis Costel­lo Banned From <i>Sat­ur­day Night Live</i> (1977)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Birth of the Blues Brothers: How Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi Started Introducing a New Generation to the Blues\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/04/the-birth-of-the-blues-brothers.html\">The Birth of the Blues Broth­ers: How Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi Start­ed Intro­duc­ing a New Gen­er­a­tion to the Blues</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to <i>Saturday Night Live</i>’s Very First Sketch: Watch John Belushi Launch SNL in October, 1975\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/03/saturday-night-lives-very-first-sketch.html\"><i>Sat­ur­day Night Live</i>’s Very First Sketch: Watch John Belushi Launch SNL in Octo­ber, 1975</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>",

Lat­er still, in 1972, that piece of music was adopt­ed by the Coun­cil of Europe as the con­ti­nen­t’s anthem; in 1985, the Euro­pean Union made it offi­cial as well.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/p5favl2Qtx0?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a sense, “Ode to Joy” is a nat­ur­al choice for a musi­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Europe, not just for its explic­it themes, but also for the obvi­ous ambi­tion of the sym­pho­ny that includes it to cap­ture an entire civ­i­liza­tion in musi­cal form.</p>\n<p>Its com­plex­i­ty and con­tra­dic­tion may be eas­i­er to appre­ci­ate through these videos, which con­sti­tute <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL865A414178BA4B6F\">a visu­al­iza­tion by Stephen Mali­nows­ki</a>, cre­ator of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/11/watch-classical-music-come-to-life-in-artfully-animated-scores.html\">Music Ani­ma­tion Machine</a>, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture for his ani­mat­ed scores of every­thing from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/?p=1122099\">Vivaldi’s <em>Four Sea­sons</em></a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/05/bachs_brandenburg_concerto_4_visualized_by_the_great_music_animation_machine.html\">Bach’s Bran­den­burg Con­cer­to no. 4</a> to Debussy’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/10/debussys-clair-de-lune.html\"><em>Clair de lune</em></a>.

Though already deaf, Beethoven nev­er­the­less com­posed this final com­plete sym­pho­ny with lay­er after ever-chang­ing yet inter­lock­ing lay­er, draw­ing from a vari­ety of musi­cal tra­di­tions as well as pieces he’d already writ­ten for oth­er pur­pos­es.

Still, it would sure­ly be called to mind by a vis­it to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://luraycaverns.com/\">Luray Cav­erns</a> in the Amer­i­can state of Vir­ginia, home of the Great Sta­lacpipe Organ. As its name sug­gests, that attrac­tion is an organ made out of sta­lac­tites, the geo­log­i­cal for­ma­tions that grow from cave ceil­ings. Not long after the dis­cov­ery of Luray Cav­erns itself in 1878, its sta­lac­tites were found to res­onate through the under­ground space in an almost musi­cal fash­ion when struck — a prop­er­ty Leland W. Sprin­kle took to its log­i­cal con­clu­sion in the mid-nine­teen fifties.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/LsjN2AK8l1o?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>“Dur­ing a tour of this world-famous nat­ur­al won­der, Mr. Sprin­kle watched in awe, which was still cus­tom­ary at the time, as a tour guide tapped the ancient stone for­ma­tions with a small mal­let, pro­duc­ing a musi­cal tone,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://luraycaverns.com/news/the-great-stalacpipe-organ/\">says Luray Cav­erns’ offi­cial site</a>. “Mr. Sprin­kle was great­ly inspired by this demon­stra­tion and the idea for a most unique instru­ment was con­ceived.”</p>\n<p>Con­cep­tion was one thing, but exe­cu­tion quite anoth­er: it took him three years to locate just the right sta­lac­tites, shave them down to ring out at just the right fre­quen­cy, and rig them up with elec­tron­i­cal­ly acti­vat­ed, key­board-con­trolled mal­lets. For the tech­ni­cal­ly mind­ed Sprin­kle, who worked at the Pen­ta­gon as a math­e­mati­cian and elec­tron­ics sci­en­tist, this must not have been quite as tedious a labor as it sounds.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nU7qsaVfn-8?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>The result was the biggest, the old­est (at least accord­ing to the age of the cave itself), and arguably the weird­est musi­cal instru­ment on Earth, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/09/watch-an-archaeologist-play-the-lithophone.html\">litho­phone</a> for the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry’s hero­ic age of engi­neer­ing.

That artist is known for her immersive <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/chiharu-shiota\">string installations</a>, inviting us into emotive, atmospheric experiences that tap into both universal and deeply personal narratives.</p>\n<p>In <em>Two Home Countries</em>, viewers enter a vivid world shaped by red thread, redolent of intertwined veins and blood vessels that attach to the floor, take on the shapes of houses, and spread through an entire room with a cloud-like aura of red—filled with written pages. Themes of memory, mortality, connection, identity, and belonging weave through Shiota’s pieces, exploring “how pain, displacement, boundaries, and existential uncertainty shape the human condition and our understanding of self,” the gallery says.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of a full-room installation of red fiber and paper pages by Chiharu Shiota\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-640x461.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-960x692.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-768x554.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-1536x1107.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Diary” (2025) in ‘Chiharu Shiota: Two Home Countries’ at Japan Society Gallery, New York, 2025</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An expansive, room-sized work titled “Diary,” which is based on an <a href=\"https://www.chiharu-shiota.com/diary-1\" target=\"_blank\">earlier installation</a> and commissioned anew for <em>Two Home Countries, </em>incorporates a dense web of yarn in which float pages of journals that once belonged to Japanese soldiers. Some were also penned by German civilians in the post-war era. “The accumulated pages reveal an expansive record of shared human existence across national boundaries,” the gallery says.</p>\n<p>“When the body is gone, the objects which surrounded them remain behind,” Shiota says in a statement. “As I wander the stalls of the markets in Berlin, I find especially personal items like photographs, old passports, and personal diaries. Once, I found a diary from 1946, which was an intimate insight into the person’s life and experiences.” For Shiota, the power of these objects are revealed in how she feels the presence of writer’s “inner self.”</p>\n<p><em>Two Home Countries </em>is on view through January 11 in New York City.

While Craig is based in New York, and Karl is based in London, the two collaborate across the pond—and around the world—to produce multimedia installations that revitalize urban spaces and celebrate the power of play.</p>\n<p>As part of the 2025 <a href=\"https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Brisbane Festival</a>, Craig & Karl created a pair of large-scale inflatable interventions on two of the city’s bridges, both riffing on the idea of the arch as passageway. Additionally, numerous illustrations, interactive sculptures, and inflatable “Mateys” — a series of quirky characters with expressive faces — pop up on buildings and sidewalks to enable joyful encounters as part of the expansive, city-wide exhibition titled <em>Rear Vision.</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg\" alt=\"colorful, inflatable arches by Craig & Karl are installed on a long bridge in Bisbrane, illuminated at night\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Walk This Way” (2025), Kangaroo Point Bridge, Brisbane.

The expressive, flexible characters are also immanently relatable for viewers of all ages. “The Mateys serve as companions that help foster community and shared experiences, welcoming us into different corners of the city,” says a festival statement.</p>\n<p>Craig & Karl are known for their vivid participatory projects, which range from mini-golf courses to playgrounds to murals. The artists initially met 30 years ago while studying at Griffith University in Brisbane, and since, their collaborative practice has included partnerships with global brands and publications like Adidas, Nike, Apple, Chanel, <em>The New Yorker, Variety, </em>and more.</p>\n<p>While the bridge installations came to a close at the end of September, you can still stroll along the <em>Public Art Trail</em> through October 20 to spot Craig & Karl’s sculptures and installations in unexpected places.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In the hands of Argentinian tattooer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pontotattoo/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Ponto</a>, lush gradients and surreal compositions emerge from layers and layers of tiny dots. Entirely self-taught, Ponto never learned to use the machines typical for many artists working in the medium. He instead embarked on an experimental journey 13 years ago that has since produced a vibrant catalog of designs, from a grayscale eye crying primary colors or a vivid beam shooting from a flying saucer.</p>\n<p>Ponto shares that while his process is typically slower than that of artists who utilize machines, his tools and approach are simple. “I just have to layer dots until I reach my desired saturation and look, which varies from skin to skin and the tattoo’s characteristics,” he says. “I use several kinds of needles to play with dot width, resolution, tattooing depth, ink saturation, and a few more variables to create my designs.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5.jpg\" alt=\"a white arm with a tattoo by Nano Ponto of a vibrant gradient beaming from a flying saucer\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5.jpg 1200w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-640x533.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-960x800.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-768x640.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n<p>While based in Buenos Aires, Ponto has spent the past few years moving between Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. Travel has been essential to his development from the beginning because most artists work with newer technologies and don’t share the same technical approaches. “Ten years ago, it was key for me to start traveling to meet other handpoked tattoo artists to share experience and knowledge, as there was no one in Argentina I could do this with,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Ponto’s latest travels have brought him to Brooklyn, where he’s a guest resident this month at <a href=\"https://www.ateliereva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Atelier Eva</a>.

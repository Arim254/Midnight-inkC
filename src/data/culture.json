    "body": "\n\tin History, Music, Podcasts |   \tDecember 23rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen dis­cussing a musi­cian like Fela Kuti, many of our usu­al terms fail us. They fail us, that is, if we came of age in a musi­cal cul­ture in which artists and bands put out an album of ten or so lyrics-for­ward songs every two or three years, pro­mot­ing it on tour while also play­ing their biggest hits. Fela — as all his fans refer to him — could put out six or sev­en albums in a sin­gle year, and refused to play live any mate­r­i­al he’d already record­ed. Even the word song, as we know it, does­n’t quite reflect the nature of his com­po­si­tions, which got expan­sive enough that two or three of them (or just one, half of it on each side) could fill a long-play­ing record.\nWal­ter Ben­jamin said of great lit­er­ary works that they either dis­solve a genre or invent one, and Fela’s musi­cal works invent­ed the genre of Afrobeat. The sound of that genre, as explained by Noah Lefevre in the Poly­phon­ic video above, reflects the dis­tinc­tive for­ma­tion of Fela him­self, who was born and raised in Nige­ria, stud­ied at the Trin­i­ty Col­lege of Music in Lon­don, and came of age dur­ing the end of Africa’s era of decol­o­niza­tion. To a lis­ten­er reared on Anglo-Amer­i­can pop­u­lar music, his sig­na­ture mix­ture of West African rhythms with jazz and funk tex­tures sounds famil­iar enough — at least for the first ten or fif­teen min­utes, after which time the lis­ten­ing expe­ri­ence ascends to a dif­fer­ent state entire­ly.\nSome­times it takes Fela just about that long to start singing, and when he does, he’s giv­en to procla­ma­tions, chants, calls-and-respons­es, and polit­i­cal exhor­ta­tions deliv­ered in the kind of Eng­lish that sounds high­ly unfa­mil­iar to non-African lis­ten­ers. Not that it’s always alien­at­ing: indeed, this par­tic­u­lar com­bi­na­tion of words and music has cap­ti­vat­ed gen­er­a­tions of lis­ten­ers from far out­side its place of ori­gin. One of them is David Byrne, who used Talk­ing Heads’ Remain in Light as more or less a medi­um for chan­nel­ing the musi­cal spir­it of Fela. Not that he him­self was gone yet: indeed, he had almost two decades of his event­ful life to go, one you can learn much more about from Fela Kuti: Fear No Man, a twelve-part bio­graph­i­cal pod­cast by Jad Abum­rad.\n\nBrought into Fela’s world by a fam­i­ly con­nec­tion, that for­mer Radi­o­lab host con­duct­ed dozens and dozens of inter­views on the rela­tion­ship between the man, his music, and the polit­i­cal con­text in which he found him­self. The facts, as any Fela fan knows, don’t always align com­fort­ably with main­stream sen­si­bil­i­ties of the twen­ty-twen­ties — the charges range from essen­tial­ism to polygamy — but as Lefevre reminds us, an artist should be inter­pret­ed through the lens of his own cul­ture and his­to­ry. How­ev­er many of us con­sid­er him a “prob­lem­at­ic fave” today, Fela Kuti will always be the man who invent­ed Afrobeat — and since nobody else has quite man­aged to repli­cate his grooves in their simul­ta­ne­ous tight­ness and loose­ness, blunt­ness and sub­tle­ty, per­haps also the man who dis­solved it.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAn Intro­duc­tion to the Life & Music of Fela Kuti: Rad­i­cal Niger­ian Band­leader, Polit­i­cal Hero, and Cre­ator of Afrobeat\nWhen Afrobeat Leg­end Fela Kuti Col­lab­o­rat­ed with Cream Drum­mer Gin­ger Bak­er\nZam­rock: An Intro­duc­tion to Zambia’s 1970s Rich & Psy­che­del­ic Rock Scene\nWatch the Talk­ing Heads Play Mate­r­i­al From Their Ground­break­ing Album Remain in Light in an Incred­i­ble Con­cert from 1980\nThe Awe-Inspir­ing But Trag­ic Sto­ry of Africa’s Fes­ti­val In The Desert (2001–2012)\nStream 8,000 Vin­tage Afropop Record­ings Dig­i­tized & Made Avail­able by The British Library\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tDecember 23rd, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nDie Hard is a Christ­mas movie. That once-con­trar­i­an cat­e­go­riza­tion has increas­ing­ly been accept­ed over the past cou­ple of decades, at least since an edi­tor with whom I’ve often worked first declared it in a Slate roundup. As a result, John McTier­nan’s stur­dy piece of one-build­ing eight­ies Hol­ly­wood action may have dis­placed It’s a Won­der­ful Life as a hol­i­day home-video tra­di­tion in cer­tain house­holds. But it’s also stoked a broad­er desire for ever more alter­na­tive Christ­mas movies with sub­tle, even sub­ver­sive hol­i­day ele­ments. If you, too, can’t han­dle yet anoth­er view­ing of Mir­a­cle on 34th Street, A Christ­mas Sto­ry, or Home Alone this year, have a look at the top ten lists com­piled in these four videos, which offer a selec­tion of films beyond — some­times well beyond — the estab­lished sea­son­al canon.\n\n\n\t\n\nThese selec­tions come from a vari­ety of gen­res, includ­ing the super­hero pic­ture: if you haven’t seen Bat­man Returns in a few decades, you may have for­got­ten how thor­ough­ly Tim Bur­ton sat­u­rates it with Christ­mas imagery, albeit of a kind suit­ed to the dank, men­ac­ing Gotham City. Those who want to crank up the dark­ness fur­ther still would do well to put on the Cana­di­an soror­i­ty-house slash­er film Black Christ­mas, which also appears on more than one of these lists.\nJoe Dan­te’s Yule­tide-set Grem­lins con­tains much high­er-bud­get spec­ta­cles of destruc­tion, albeit comedic ones; the humor of Ter­ry Gilliam’s Brazil, anoth­er elab­o­rate mid-eight­ies auteur project, runs to the dystopi­an, a sen­si­bil­i­ty cer­tain­ly present in the hol­i­day sea­son itself, if sel­dom treat­ed with such grotesque vivid­ness.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe work of no sin­gle pro­fes­sion­al makes these alter­na­tive Christ­mas movie lists more often than Shane Black, the writer of Lethal Weapon (with Die Hard, the mak­ings of a hol­i­day dou­ble bill if ever there was one) and The Long Kiss Good­night, as well as the writer-direc­tor of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3, and The Nice Guys. That all of those pic­tures are set at Christ­mas­time makes them feel — no mat­ter how height­ened, fan­tas­ti­cal, or visu­al effects-sat­u­rat­ed they may be — pal­pa­bly con­nect­ed to our own real­i­ty. It also tends to inten­si­fy the dra­ma: as Black remarked in one inter­view, “Christ­mas rep­re­sents a lit­tle stut­ter in the march of days, a hush in which we have a chance to assess and ret­ro­spect our lives.” Which hard­ly means, of course, that it can’t be enter­tain­ing.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch San­ta Claus, the Ear­li­est Movie About San­ta in Exis­tence (1898)\nWatch The Insects’ Christ­mas from 1913: A Stop Motion Film Star­ring a Cast of Dead Bugs\nAn Ani­mat­ed Christ­mas Fable by Mau­rice Sendak (1977)\nThe Junky’s Christ­mas: William S.

    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tDecember 24th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOne can hard­ly con­sid­er the Christ­mas sea­son for long, at least in the Eng­lish-speak­ing world, with­out the work of Charles Dick­ens com­ing to mind. That owes for the most part, of course, to A Christ­mas Car­ol, the novel­la that revived the pub­lic cul­ture of a hol­i­day that had been falling into desue­tude by the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry. What­ev­er its lit­er­ary short­com­ings, the book offers a host of mem­o­rable images, not least culi­nary ones: Mrs. Cratchit’s pud­ding, for instance, which Dick­ens likens to “a speck­led can­non-ball, so hard and firm, blaz­ing in half or half-a-quar­tern of ignit­ed brandy, and bedight with Christ­mas hol­ly stuck into the top.”\n\n\n\t\n\nIn the Tast­ing His­to­ry video at the top of the post, host Max Miller teach­es you how to make just such a hol­i­day pud­ding — and indeed a fig­gy one, a con­fec­tion whose name we all rec­og­nize from no less a stan­dard car­ol than “We Wish You a Mer­ry Christ­mas,” even if we don’t know that pud­ding, in the Vic­to­ri­an sense, refers to a kind of cake.\nThe fig­gy pud­ding Miller makes from an orig­i­nal 1845 recipe looks, and seems to taste, more like an alco­hol-soaked ver­sion of the fruit­cakes many of us still receive come Christ­mas­time. Despite its rep­u­ta­tion for lead­en unde­sir­abil­i­ty, rein­forced by decade after decade of John­ny Car­son gags, the fruit­cake has a rich his­to­ry, which Miller reveals in the video just above, and culi­nary strengths beyond its extreme shelf life.\n\n\n\t\n\nThis playlist of 20 Christ­mas-themed videos offers many more such delights: Turk­ish delight, for instance, as well as Vic­to­ri­an sug­ar plums, medieval gin­ger­bread, and his­tor­i­cal ver­sions of such still-com­mon com­forts and joys as eggnog and pump­kin pie. And if you’ve ever won­dered to what was­sail — as a noun or a verb — actu­al­ly refers, have a look at the video above, in which Miller explains it all while mak­ing a pot of the stuff, which turns out to be a kind of apple­sauce-enriched ale. Was­sail, too, is a favorite Dick­ens ref­er­ence, and not just in A Christ­mas Car­ol. His first nov­el The Pick­wick Papers includes a Christ­mas feast with “a mighty bowl of was­sail, some­thing small­er than an ordi­nary wash-house cop­per, in which the hot apples were hiss­ing and bub­bling with a rich look, and a jol­ly sound, that were per­fect­ly irre­sistible”: the kind of image that, near­ly two cen­turies lat­er, still makes read­ers want to go a‑wassailing.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nEudo­ra Welty’s Hand­writ­ten Eggnog Recipe, and Charles Dick­ens’ Recipe for Hol­i­day Punch\nTry George Orwell’s Recipe for Christ­mas Pud­ding, from His Essay “British Cook­ery” (1945)\nCharles Min­gus’ “Top Secret” Eggnog Recipe Con­tains “Enough Alco­hol to Put Down an Ele­phant”\nHow Eat­ing Ken­tucky Fried Chick­en Became a Christ­mas Tra­di­tion in Japan\nTast­ing His­to­ry: A Hit YouTube Series Shows How to Cook the Foods of Ancient Greece & Rome, Medieval Europe, and Oth­er Places & Peri­ods\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhat is the value of knowledge? A coffee shop latte easily costs six dollars or more these days, but peruse any used book sale and you’ll find classics of literature and science for mere cents—published works that have had an indelible impact on culture.\nIn many cases, mass production has rendered the value of books—as objects—at pennies. Used bookstores with buy-back policies often play a vital role in simply being able to properly recycle or dispose of volumes that are no longer salable. Hundreds of millions of books are tossed each year, whether due to overstock, age, or damage, which is an ongoing problem for the publishing industry.\n“The New American” (2021), hardcover book, acrylic varnish, 6.75 x 4.125 x 1.875 inches\nWhile some genres have fallen out of widespread use in our digital age, such as encyclopedia sets, what happens to them after they’re no longer needed is an ongoing sustainability challenge. For artists like Brian Dettmer, an out-of-date reference book isn’t a useless item but a trove of imagery and formal possibilities.\nIn the artist’s solo exhibition, In·Formation at Riverside Arts Center, work made over the past few years explores collage and sculpture through the medium of books. From cut-up elements interwoven into wall reliefs to freestanding forms made from carving directly into thick tomes, Dettmer highlights the afterlife of hardcover publications like dictionaries, atlases, guides, and other reference titles. He often meticulously splices elements together to create layered, stacked, and diorama-stuffed assemblages.\n“There is a randomness to what is revealed, followed by the thoughtfulness of what should remain,” the gallery says. “With each incision, Dettmer strips away layers to expose previously hidden texts and images, often editing the material and assembling it with his own vernacular that suggests new information.” What the artist chooses to reveal, conceal, or even redact—such as the titles on the spines of selected copies used in “Great Houses of Gardening Corners,” for example—nods to our increasingly tenuous relationship with how information is conveyed to us.\nIn·Formation continues through January 24 in Riverside, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

These are developed by AX Mina, a Hyperallergic contributor and producer for Five and Nine, a podcast about magic, work, and economic justice. These tarotscopes have a special focus on the arts and creative practice, for each solstice and equinox, to mark the turning of the seasons.In premodern times, the winter solstice would be felt intensely for its extended darkness. Today, with the abundance of artificial light, it can come and go with little notice. In San Francisco, where this reading was conducted, power outages have affected more than 10,000 people, a reminder of how delicate our systems of light really are. Rain fell during the solstice, and I found myself stuck on the train for an unexpected amount of time, unable to cross the Bay. With the city lights dimmed, I paused to notice the night sky, which is particularly compelling in the winter. Orion’s club was shining brightly above, joined with Canis Major and Canis Minor to form the Winter Triangle. This season’s tarotscope, as with most of ours, is read using the Mixed Signals Tarot, designed by artist M Eilo, on the tarot platform Moonlight. The cards were drawn in the midst of the Winter Solstice, in this 12th month of the Hermit Year (in the tarot system) and the final months of the Snake Year (in the East Asian lunar system).For this winter solstice, we read with the Thaw, a special spread offered by Moonlight. The first reflects a collective exploration of why many of us have felt frozen. The second suggests the first small signs of thaw. And then we draw a guide, customized to your astrological element, that gives you guidance for navigating this time of winter. We start with an inquiry: What must we keep in mind in the year’s twilight? As so much of the world slows down, the earth’s orbit around the sun continues unabated, reminding us that nothing is permanent — neither darkness nor light. Our planet simply turns and turns, giving us the seasons and their long days and long nights.Collective Tarot ReadingWhy We’ve Felt Frozen: Speaker of Wands (reversed)The First Small Sign of Thaw: Maker of CupsThe Wands are the suit of fire and inspiration, and the Speaker is the suit of power. In the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, this is considered the King of Wands, while M Eilo’s deck depicts it as a group of people speaking powerfully. They are reversed, which in tarot can indicate a blockage or challenge. For many artists right now, the past noise and activity of the community voice might remain silenced for the moment. In many ways, it is the energy of the Snake Year, often a difficult time of shedding and rebirth.The first small sign of thaw comes in the form of the Maker of Cups, known as the Queen of Cups in the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. Look carefully at this card: the Cups represent the suit of water, the depths of the heart. The hands cherish the cup, like an invitation into the heart. As we sit still in this final week of 2025, listen carefully to the heart. That little voice is whispering to you through this solstice and into the coming Year of the Horse. Below, you’ll find further guidance in the form of a single card for each group of zodiac signs. Imagine them as guides into the long night, as we slither slowly into a new year.Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)Guide: Fighter of Cups (reversed)Here, the Fighter of Cups points to the importance of taking a moment for pause. The Fighter (the Knight in the Rider-Waite-Smith deck) is a prompt to consider the substance of your emotions. The Cup, the suit of water, is an invitation to slow our pace, apparently contra your sign’s fiery nature. This is a simple interval with simple guidance — check in with your body and mind before you proceed into the new year, observe what’s arisen for you in 2025 and what your heart carries forward.Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)Guide: DeathThe Death card is often feared for its literal meaning. I welcome you to consider its metaphorical one instead. As the year comes to a close, reflect on what elements of 2025 with which you should part ways. In a year of intensity, a metaphorical death allows for rebirth. If you have experienced literal death this year, this card may encourage you to honor your grief. Whether the loss you’ve experienced is metaphorical or literal, consider a sacred ritual to mark the passing and ground you.Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)Window: Temperance (reversed)M Eilo portrays Temperance as a cozy place with books, pillows, and a blanket or two. Reversed, it is still a site of study for your busy mind, but perhaps the usual sources of comfort feel empty right now. The conditions of temperance depend on the individual, and only you can know your own. You can spend time with books, journaling and ruminating to find the balance you seek, but this card and its placement propose that temperance may best be found from lived experiences.Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)Window: Strength (reversed)The water signs, known for their strong emotions, are often mistaken for not having strength, but their strength comes through their ability to feel deeply. It’s possible you may be struggling with this superpower (aren’t all superpowers a double-edged sword?). I was reminded of Theodore Roethke's poem \"In a Dark Time,\" which describes feeling deeply, almost as if it was written during the winter solstice:In a dark time, the eye begins to see,I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;I hear my echo in the echoing wood—A lord of nature weeping to a tree.\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Hyperallergic’s Art Tarotscope\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Greta Rainbow holds your hand through the delicious drama, which is on full view at The Met’s Divine Egypt show.But the holiday season brings not just living room squabbles but ideological battles waged on a national and global stage. Banksy just painted a sobering mural in London addressing child homelessness — a stark reminder during a season meant for warmth, safety, and joy. Meanwhile, Christian nationalists often decry a so-called \"war on Christmas\" — all while pearl-clutching when Christian values are fully on view, as in a nativity scene protesting ICE's family separations and deportations at a parish in Dedham, Massachusetts. As Ed Simon writes, nativity scenes are inherently political — they declare that God dwells in the lowliest of places, among the marginalized and dispossessed. That's the true spirit of the holidays.

    "body": "\n            Some art publications worship the powerful. Here at Hyperallergic, we stand by the powerless. Welcome to the 2025 edition of the 20 Most Powerless People in the Art World, our annual antidote to the asinine lists of wealthy collectors, royals, and so-called tastemakers that pervade the market-driven art media. To be clear, the people and entities on this list are by no means weak or pitiable. Quite the opposite: They are the most resilient, unbreakable individuals and communities we can think of. This list celebrates their strength and the inspiration they give to all of us. Per tradition, we’ve peppered some of the entries with a bit of humor, another important means of resistance. Here’s to hoping for a new year that finds power in the hands of the many, not the few.—Hakim Bishara, editor-in-chief 1. International Art Students — They come here seeking a better education, and deplete their savings to pay exorbitant tuition fees, only to be treated as security threats. They may suffer in the short term, but the real loser here is higher education in the United States.  2. Arts Organizations That Get Federal Grants — Thousands of museums and organizations had the rug pulled out from under them when Trump and Elon Musk’s short-lived DOGE axed promised grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, seemingly without rhyme or reason. Some of the latter were reinstated earlier this month, but it was too little, too late, as many recipients had already made crucial programmatic and spending decisions.  3. Undocumented Artists — Historically ignored by the art establishment, they now live under the immediate threat of being torn away from their families and deported to concentration camps in countries they’ve never set foot in. The art community should do more to protect these most vulnerable artists.   4. Smithsonian Institution — The Smithsonian relies on government funding for more than half of its budget. This must be the art world’s most toxic relationship, as the institute has nowhere else to go. The Trump administration is well aware of this and continues to escalate its abusive tactics, even releasing a chilling list of artworks at the institution that it accuses of “divisive narratives.\" This has also cost the director of the National Portrait Gallery, Kim Sajet, her job. We won't be surprised if the institution is renamed the Trumpsonian. 5. Trans Artists — Unfortunately but unsurprisingly back on Hyperallergic’s Powerless List yet again, trans and nonbinary artists suffered an especially cruel year under President Trump, whose administration is not only targeting gender-affirming care for minors but denying the very existence of trans individuals in mandates and official language. You know things are very bad when Amy Sherald, arguably one of the most renowned American painters of our era, cancels a Smithsonian exhibition over fears that her portrait of a trans woman might be censored.   The charred remains of artist Christina Quarles's Altadena home, which was already undergoing renovations after a house fire in April (photo courtesy Christina Quarles)6. LA Artists Who Lost Everything — When fires raged through Los Angeles in January, tearing through entire neighborhoods and towns, like historically vibrant Altadena, many artists said they lost their life’s work, not to mention their homes and studios. The cultural community was quick to respond with mutual aid and fundraisers in support of those affected, a glimmer of light amid the trauma and loss of a tragedy whose scale was likely preventable.7. Palestinian Solidarity Activists — Silenced for speaking the truth, doxxed by shadowy groups, abducted by federal agents, their shows have been canceled, and their livelihoods destroyed. But ultimately, history will be on their side. 8. Creators of No Other Land — In September, the Israeli military raided the home of Basel Adra, co-director of this acclaimed documentary about settler violence in Palestine. Months earlier, Awdah Hathaleen, a beloved Palestinian activist and teacher who worked on the movie, was killed by an Israeli settler in the Occupied West Bank. The saga of No Other Land proves that not even Oscar-winning filmmakers are safe.9. White House East Wing — It survived 21 administrations and periods of deep political unrest in its 123-year history until one real estate developer with particularly bad taste became a second-term president. Like many other symbols of American democracy, the White House East Wing is no more. 10. The Louvre’s Security System — Imagine being hired to protect some of the world’s most renowned art treasures and having your efforts thwarted by the dumbest security password ever. While we couldn’t independently confirm the tragic reports that the password was, yes, “LOUVRE,” countless other failings likely helped facilitate the heist of the century. Old-money taste, new-money mistakes, right? President Trump demolished the White House East Wing to build a multimillion-dollar ballroom. (photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)11. National Museum of Yemen — The Sana'a museum, best known for its collection of Sabaean artifacts, reopened in 2023 in the “Palace of Happiness” (Dar Al-Sada) after being closed for a decade during the Yemeni revolution, but this past year was less than happy for the institution, which was damaged by Israeli air strikes in September.12. Ripley’s Believe It or Not! — It must’ve seemed like a cool and wacky idea at first, to become the owners of Maurizio Cattelan's “America” (2016). But now the company is stuck with a $12 million gold toilet that no one else wanted.  13. Artists Whose Materials Were Hit by Tariffs — Thanks to the US president’s regressive trade policies, all imported goods are more expensive now, including art materials. Makes sense, because there’s nothing Trump hates more than culture.    14. DEI Programs — While Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives at museums and cultural institutions were already extremely flawed, President Trump’s ruthless attacks on even the meekest effort to redress centuries of discrimination put the final nail in the coffin. This is especially true for federally funded organizations fearful of the president’s wrath, but the move also likely emboldened private funders and corporations to embrace his pale, male, and stale vision of culture. 15. Artists and Cultural Workers in Sudan: A report by the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS) released last month identified at least 55 artists killed in the brutal civil war, a toll that attests to “a disturbing escalation from incidental wartime loss to what human rights analysts describe as a campaign of cultural cleansing.” We stand in solidarity with our Sudanese peers and friends.  Online criticism of the Philadelphia Art Museum's rebranding (screenshot Hyperallergic via @philamuseum on Instagram)16. SAIC’s Video Data Bank — Video art was not exactly thriving before this happened, but when the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) decided to strip the historic Video Data Bank (VDB), the future of media-based practices began to look even bleaker. 17. The Philadelphia Art Museum’s Brand Identity — We are already nostalgic for the simpler days of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA), which this year became the Philadelphia Art Museum, uncomfortably stylized as … PhAM. That’s not all: The institution decided to rehaul its entire brand, with a new logo that looks like an AI-generated team jersey for a made-up sports team — or, in the words of online commentators, “some kind of Cold War monstrosity.”18. Isamu Noguchi’s Legacy — The Japanese-American artist spent his entire life as an anti-fascist, while those who head his namesake museum decided to prohibit workers from wearing keffiyehs, Arab headscarves that are seen as a symbol of Palestinian solidarity. Over a year after the Noguchi Museum in New York City first announced the controversial ban, the institution is back to business as usual, but the artist’s legacy is forever stained.  19. US Pavilion at the Venice Biennale — The United States’s Venice Biennale Pavilion has seen some things this year. First Trump changed the curatorial guidelines to suit his creepy patriotic fantasies, and then Andres Serrano proposed a truly terrifying design idea that fortunately did not come to fruition. But the final punch was thrown last month, when the artist selected to represent the nation was finally announced … and he was exactly what we expected. 20. Rainbow Crosswalks — It was a bad year for the multicolored stripes painted on street crossings as a symbol of LGBTQ+ pride and solidarity. Out of the many reports of their erasure at the behest of Republican officials across the country, perhaps no incident was more egregious than Florida’s shameless removal of a rainbow crosswalk memorial honoring the victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting.  Honorable Mentions• Poorly Positioned Art Fair Booths — We’ve seen it happen: a gallery shells out several grand for a minute piece of real estate on an art fair floor, only to be relegated to a dark corner near the bathrooms — or, worse yet, a new section with an insipid and ambiguous name, like “Neutron” or “Perpetual,” that was obviously thrown together last-minute to lump all the peasants in one place.  • Art Writers Who Love Em Dashes — Many of us love a good em dash — but AI came and ruined that, too. Thank you, AI slop machines — it’s said that they use em dashes profusely — for killing our joy. But you know what — you won’t stop us!• Beloved Art Material Shops — Having served expert knitters and crafty kindergarten teachers alike for eight decades, Joann, formerly Jo-Ann Fabrics, officially went out of business this year following two bankruptcy filings. Kremer Pigments, a family-run paint store worshipped by artists, closed its New York City location, citing rising rents and tariffs. It's a bad omen, if you ask us. \n                  \n                      \n                        Powerless 20\n                      \n                  \n        ",

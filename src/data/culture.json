    "body": "\n\tin Creativity, Film |   \tOctober 22nd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe prac­tice of car­toman­cy, or div­ina­tion with cards, dates back sev­er­al hun­dred years to at least 14th cen­tu­ry Europe, per­haps by way of Turkey. But the spe­cif­ic form we know of, the tarot, like­ly emerged in the 17th cen­tu­ry, and the deck we’re all most famil­iar with—the Rid­er-Waite Tarot—didn’t appear until 1909. Pop­u­lar main­ly with occultists like Aleis­ter Crow­ley and Madame Blavatsky in the ear­ly 20th cen­tu­ry, the tarot explod­ed into pop­u­lar cul­ture in the new age 70s with books like Stu­art Kaplan’s Tarot Cards for Fun and For­tune Telling, and by way of cult film­mak­ers like Ale­jan­dro Jodor­owsky.\nSince its rel­a­tive­ly recent pop­u­lar­iza­tion, “fun” and “for­tune telling” have more or less defined most people’s atti­tude to the tarot, whether they approve or dis­ap­prove of either one. But for artists and poets like William But­ler Yeats, T.S. Eliot, and sur­re­al­ist direc­tor Jodorowsky—whose film nar­ra­tion is per­haps the most poet­ic in mod­ern cinema—the tarot has always meant some­thing much more mys­te­ri­ous and inspir­ing. “The tarot,” says Jodor­owsky in the short film above, “will teach you how to cre­ate a soul.”\nAfter study­ing the Major and Minor Arcana and the suits, and puz­zling over the sym­bols on each card, Jodor­owsky dis­cov­ered that “all 78 cards could be joined in a man­dala, in just one image.” Learn­ing to see the deck thus, “You must not talk about the future. The future is a con. The tarot is a lan­guage that talks about the present. If you use it to see the future, you become a con­man.” Like oth­er mys­ti­cal poets, Jodorowsky’s study of the tarot did not lead him to the super­nat­ur­al but to the cre­ative act.\n\n\n\t\n\nAnd like many a poet before him, Jodor­owsky explored the jour­ney of the Fool in his 1973 film The Holy Moun­tain, a “daz­zling, ram­bling, often inco­her­ent satire,” writes Matt Zoller Seitz, that “unfurls like a hal­lu­cino­genic day­dream.” Jodorowsky’s cin­e­mat­ic dream log­ic comes not only from his work as a “shaman­ic psy­chother­a­pist.” He also cred­its the tarot for his psy­chomag­i­cal real­ism. “For me,” says Jodor­owsky in the video at the top, “the tarot was some­thing more seri­ous. It was a deep psy­cho­log­i­cal search.” The result of that search—Jodorowsky’s sin­gu­lar and total­ly unfor­get­table body of work—speaks to us of the val­ue of such an under­tak­ing, what­ev­er means one uses to get there.\nOr as Jodor­owsky says in one of his mys­ti­cal pro­nounce­ments, “If you set your spir­it to some­thing, that phe­nom­e­non will hap­pen.” If that sounds like mag­i­cal think­ing, that’s exact­ly what it is. Jodor­owsky shows us how to read the tarot as he does, for psy­cho­log­i­cal insight and cre­ative inspi­ra­tion, in the video above, addressed to a fan named John Bish­op. Span­ish speak­ers will have no trou­ble under­stand­ing his pre­sen­ta­tion, as he quick­ly slides almost ful­ly into his native lan­guage through lack of con­fi­dence in his facil­i­ty with Eng­lish. The video belongs to a series on Jodorowsky’s YouTube chan­nel, most of them ful­ly in Span­ish with­out sub­ti­tles.\n\n\n\t\n\nNev­er­the­less, for Eng­lish speak­ers, the sub­ti­tled video at the top offers a sur­pris­ing­ly dense les­son on the Chilean mystic’s inter­pre­ta­tion of the tarot’s sup­posed wis­dom as a sym­bol­ic sys­tem, and a way of telling the present.\nShould you wish to know more, you can find it in Jodorowsky’s book The Way of Tarot: The Spir­i­tu­al Teacher in the Cards, and prac­tice on your very own deck of Jodor­owsky-designed tarot cards.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMeet the For­got­ten Female Artist Behind the World’s Most Pop­u­lar Tarot Deck (1909)\nBehold the Sola-Bus­ca Tarot Deck, the Ear­li­est Com­plete Set of Tarot Cards (1490)\nCarl Jung on the Pow­er of Tarot Cards: They Pro­vide Door­ways to the Uncon­scious & Per­haps a Way to Pre­dict the Future\nThe Tarot Card Deck Cre­at­ed by Sal­vador Dalí\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tOctober 22nd, 2025  6 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you wish to become a cinephile wor­thy of the title, you must first pledge nev­er to refuse to watch a film for any of the fol­low­ing rea­sons. First, that it is in a dif­fer­ent lan­guage and sub­ti­tled; sec­ond, that it is too old; third, that it is too slow; fourth, that it is too long; and fifth, that it has no “sto­ry.” These cat­e­gories of refusal are what Lewis Bond, co-cre­ator of the YouTube chan­nel The House of Tab­u­la, calls “the five car­di­nal sins of cin­e­ma,” and no one who com­mits them can ever attain an under­stand­ing of the art form, its nature, its his­to­ry, and its poten­tial. Once you’ve made your vow, you’ll be ready to watch through the 135 chrono­log­i­cal­ly ordered motion pic­tures that con­sti­tute The House of Tab­u­la’s “Ulti­mate Film Stud­ies Watch­list,” ful­ly explained in the video above.\nWhile the movies first emerged in the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry, and plen­ty con­tin­ue to be made here in the twen­ty-first, they stand unop­posed as the defin­ing pop­u­lar art form of the twen­ti­eth. And it is from the span of that cen­tu­ry that all the films on this list are drawn, from Georges Méliès’ Le Voy­age dans la Lune and D. W. Grif­fith’s The Birth of a Nation to all the way to Quentin Taran­ti­no’s Pulp Fic­tion and the Wachowskis’ The Matrix. \nWhat hap­pened to cin­e­ma between those peri­ods was, in a sense, a process of tech­no­log­i­cal and artis­tic evo­lu­tion, but as Bond’s com­men­tary under­scores, old­er films aren’t super­seded by new­er ones — or at least, old­er films of val­ue aren’t. Indeed, the ambi­tion and cre­ativ­i­ty of these decades, or even cen­tu­ry-old movies, puts many a cur­rent release to shame.\nBy no means is the list dom­i­nat­ed by obscu­ri­ties. Gone with the Wind, Fan­ta­sia, Sin­gin’ in the Rain, Psy­cho, Jaws, Alien: even the least cin­e­mat­i­cal­ly inclined among us have seen a few of these movies, or at least they feel like they have. Maybe they’ve nev­er got around to watch­ing Cit­i­zen Kane, but they’ll have a sense that it belongs on any syl­labus meant to cul­ti­vate an under­stand­ing of film as an art form. The pres­ence of Star Wars may come as more of a sur­prise, but no less than Cit­i­zen Kane, it illus­trates the ben­e­fit of watch­ing your way through cin­e­ma his­to­ry: if you do, you’ll expe­ri­ence just how much of a break they rep­re­sent­ed with all that came before. Ordi­nary movie­go­ers may feel like they’ve seen it all before, but cinephiles — espe­cial­ly those who’ve made the jour­ney through The House of Tab­u­la’s watch­list — know how vast an area of cin­e­mat­ic pos­si­bil­i­ty remains unex­plored.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n78 Great Direc­tors Who Shaped the His­to­ry of Cin­e­ma: An Intro­duc­tion\nThe 30 Great­est Films Ever Made: A Video Essay\nMar­tin Scors­ese Cre­ates a List of 39 Essen­tial For­eign Films for a Young Film­mak­er\nThe Evo­lu­tion of Cin­e­ma: Watch Near­ly 140 Years of Film His­to­ry Unfold in 80 Min­utes\nTake a 16-Week Crash Course on the His­to­ry of Movies: From the First Mov­ing Pic­tures to the Rise of Mul­ti­plex­es & Net­flix\nThe 15 Great­est Doc­u­men­taries of All Time: Explore Films by Wern­er Her­zog, Errol Mor­ris & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Design, History |   \tOctober 23rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMore than a few of us might be inter­est­ed in the oppor­tu­ni­ty to spend a day in Vic­to­ri­an Lon­don. But very few of us indeed who’ve ever read, say, a Charles Dick­ens nov­el would ever elect to live there. “Lon­don’s lit­tle lanes are charm­ing now,” says Shee­han Quirke, the host of the video above, while stand­ing in one of them, “but 150 years ago in places like this, you’d have had whole fam­i­lies crammed into these tiny rooms with­out run­ning water. There would have been open cesspits spilling down the streets, and the stench of sewage boil­ing in the mid­day sun would have been unbear­able.” The stink­ing city, already the biggest in the world and grow­ing every day, “was­n’t only hor­ri­ble to live in, but gen­uine­ly dan­ger­ous.”\nMuch of the tremen­dous amount of waste pro­duced by Lon­don­ers went straight into the Riv­er Thames, which even­tu­al­ly grew so foul that the engi­neer Joseph Bazal­gette took on the job of design­ing not just a sew­er sys­tem, but also an embank­ment to “replace what was essen­tial­ly a stink­ing swamp filled with rub­bish and human waste and eels.” Though emi­nent­ly, even mirac­u­lous­ly func­tion­al, Bazal­get­te’s design was­n’t util­i­tar­i­an.\nAfter its com­ple­tion in 1870, the embank­ment was lined with elab­o­rate­ly dec­o­rat­ed lamps (some of the first pieces of elec­tric light­ing in the world) that still catch the eye of passers­by today, well into the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry. “We don’t asso­ciate dec­o­ra­tion with cut­ting-edge tech­nol­o­gy, and that’s a major dif­fer­ence between us and the Vic­to­ri­ans,” who “saw no con­tra­dic­tion between star­tling moder­ni­ty and time-hon­ored tra­di­tion.”\nQuirke became renowned as The Cul­tur­al Tutor a few years ago on the social media plat­form then called Twit­ter. His threads have cul­ti­vat­ed the under­stand­ing of count­less many read­ers about a host of sub­jects to do with his­to­ry, art, archi­tec­ture, music, and design, with an eye toward the ways in which past civ­i­liza­tions may have done them bet­ter than ours does. The Vic­to­ri­ans, for instance, may have lacked mod­ern ameni­ties that none of us could live with­out, but they designed even their sewage pump­ing sta­tions “with the same orna­men­tal exu­ber­ance as any church or palace.” Per­haps they thought their san­i­ta­tion work­ers deserved beau­ti­ful sur­round­ings; they cer­tain­ly had “a sense of pride, a belief that what they’d done here was worth­while, that it meant some­thing.” Cur­rent infra­struc­ture, large-scale and small, is tech­no­log­i­cal­ly supe­ri­or, yet almost none of it is worth regard­ing, to put it mild­ly. Whether our own civ­i­liza­tion could return to beau­ty is the ques­tion at the heart of Quirke’s enter­prise — and one his grow­ing group of fol­low­ers has begun to ask them­selves every time they step out­side.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhy Do Peo­ple Hate Mod­ern Archi­tec­ture?: A Video Essay\nRichard Feyn­man on Beau­ty\nWhy Dutch & Japan­ese Cities Are Insane­ly Well Designed (and Amer­i­can Cities Are Ter­ri­bly Designed)\nDis­cov­er The Gram­mar of Orna­ment, One of the Great Col­or Books & Design Mas­ter­pieces of the 19th Cen­tu­ry\nDieter Rams Lists the 10 Time­less Prin­ci­ples of Good Design — Backed by Music by Bri­an Eno\nSaul Bass’ Advice for Design­ers: Make Some­thing Beau­ti­ful and Don’t Wor­ry About the Mon­ey\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDuring a month in which hauntings and ghastly cosutmes are a ubiquitous sight, Brandon Morris presents a new body of work that taps into a shared sense of unease. The New York-based artist makes his Paris debut with Tissu Expansé, a collection of five fiberglass and resin gowns that appear as though they’ve come to life.\nConstructed in pale blue, the spectral works are part of Morris’ Ghost Dresses, a series that stitches together fashion and sculpture through garments that materialize without a body. Bodices are full, while skirts angle as if they’re moving with an invisible owner. One piece even lunges forward, the arms reaching out with what seems like a kick of the back leg that lifts the hem upward.\n\nTissu Expansé is more lively than the artist’s earlier collection, which saw hunched shoulders and bent postures suggestive of monstrous occupiers. While similarly haunting, these pieces appear less sinister, arising more as whimsical apparitions than supernatural villains.\nMorris’ exhibition is on view through October 30 with Europa. Keep up with his practice on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCeramics and textiles share several traditions. Both media have long occupied the realm of craft, are often functional, and tend to be tied to narrative and storytelling, whether sharing in family lore or communicating something about their owner.\nFor Shae Bishop, combining the two offers a way to tether the enduring and universal with the intimate and personal. The Richmond-based artist has spent more than a decade creating innumerable ceramic tiles that he stitches together into bandanas, suits, and other garments. “By merging the materials and fitting them to my body, I was seeking to merge the personal with the historical, to locate myself and my individual narrative within the larger story of human culture,” he tells Colossal.\n“Waistcoat of Earthly Delights” (2021), ceramic, underglaze, wool, poly satin, PE braid, wire. Photo by Loam\nBishop’s garments have evolved in complexity and embellishment during the last 14 years, as he gravitates toward art historical narratives and the self-mythologizing associated with cowboy culture. Pieces like “Waistcoat of Earthly Delights” reference Hieronymus Bosch’s famous triptych and its alternative realities. Long interested in the human-nature relationship, Bishop draws on Bosch’s biblical retelling as a way to “reimagine our fraught interactions with strange and misunderstood creatures like giant salamanders and venomous snakes,” as he adorns a vest with a pair of white serpents and vivid flowers.\nA peek at Bishop’s Instagram reveals a deep reverence for snakes—there are several images of the artist with the reptiles draped around his neck and arms— and an interest in reinventing the fear and animosity associated with the creatures, which he hopes to present instead as “a hero, an icon, and an ecological ambassador.”\nThis intention emerges, in part, through more performative works like the turquoise, fringe-lined “Rhinestone Rattlesnakeboy Suit.” Bishop often wears the elaborate getup while stationed inside a booth and handling a snake, a performance evoking entertainment ventures like Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show and the Roy Rogers Show.\nThe artist also frequently photographs himself out in the wild, whether knee-deep in a swampy landscape or perched atop a horse. These immersive images add another layer to the performative aspect of the project and reinforce the world-building and storytelling capacity that fashion has.\n“Rhinestone Rattlesnakeboy Suit.” Photo by Jack Mauch\nOf course, cowboy and Western culture are deeply entwined with American identity and masculinity, and Bishop reflects on these influences as he creates floral chaps and fringed hats. He adds: \n\nI like the tension between utility and conservatism on one hand and idiosyncratic flamboyance on the other hand. The colorful floral outfits of country music history and the high heels and ornate leatherwork of cowboy boots are such unique expressions of culture. And I look at darker elements like toxic masculinity and a gleeful love of fossil fuels. I also put myself into this work. I try to be self-critical and interrogate my own love-hate relationship with these cowboy tropes, while still keeping a sense of humor.\n\n“Rhinestone Rattlesnakeboy Suit” is on view through next September at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in an exhibition devoted to state fairs. This winter, Bishop will show pieces at Belger Arts in Kansas City and the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft, and he’s currently working on a collection of ceramic diving helmets, along with leather shoes.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn monumental installations teeming with sequins, brocades, fringe, and shiny vinyl, Anne von Freyburg stakes a bold claim about excess and freedom. \nThe artist (previously) is known for her “textile paintings,” large-scale tapestries that appear to drip, bleed, and cascade down the wall. Gaudy and yet rooted in elegance, the works draw on Dutch Golden Age and Rococo painting traditions, incoporating lush flowers and dramatic ornamentation.\n“Soft Blush (After Fragonard, The Progress of Love: The Reverie)” (2025), textile wall installation painting: acrylic ink, synthetic fabrics, PVC fabric, tapestry-fabric, sequin fabrics, hand-embroidery, polyester wadding and hand-dyed tassel fringes on canvas, 220 x 200 centimeters\nVon Freyburg continues to explore extravagance as it relates to traditional gender roles, romance, and saccharine expressions of love. She draws on Lauren Elkin’s recent book, Art Monsters, which posits that women who reject the role of wife and mother—and the societal expectations of beauty and kindness—are often seen as villains. \nThe tension between the feminine and the monstrous is evident in several of the artist’s works, including “Soft Blush (After Fragonard, The Progress of Love: The Reverie),” as pop culture symbols and text bubbles mar a central figure trapped in a chaotic blur of material. Distorted by the mass of embellishments, the woman appears grotesque and uncontainable as her form bulges and falls in a deluge of pink string. Von Freyburg adds:\n\nI approached this body of work as a declaration of the love and care necessary for all of us to thrive. It gives us permission to do the things we love doing. It’s about being free and choosing your own path to happiness in relationships. No more fairy tales about men saving women; instead, it’s about women being the heroines in their own life stories.\n\nThe vibrant pieces shown here will be on view in Amour Toujours, which runs from November 8 to December 27 at K Contemporary in Denver.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nJapan is an island nation rich in timber, from cypress (Hinoki) to cedar (Sugi) to larch (Karamatsu). Its renowned woodworking heritage dates back centuries, taking the form of immaculately carved wooden beams in houses, ornate storage boxes, and revered religious statuary. For some artists working today, this timeless tradition translates perfectly into contemporary expressions.\nHand-hewn from timber, expressive faces and dynamic motifs emerge in the sculptures of Kigaku – Re(a)lize – at FUMA Contemporary Tokyo. Colossal readers may be familiar with the work of Ikuo Inada and Yoshitoshi Kanemaki, and the show also includes recent pieces by Kosuke Ikeshima, Ayako Kita, Yuta Nakazato, and Ryo Matsumoto.\nAyako Kita, “Let Go of Everything” (2024), Japanese cypress and acrylic resin, 33.5 x 20.5 x 14 centimeters\nInada’s recognizable figurative sculptures, for example, feature sleepy people, their faces often obscured by sweatshirts or blankets, as if they are wandering back to bed after a midnight snack. Kanemaki’s characteristically glitchy portraits reveal numerous faces belonging to one personality, and Kita’s bold pieces combine carved wood with clear resin, creating an optical element with dresses one can see right through.\nThe exhibition furthers a project initiated in 2018 called Kigaku – XYLOLOGY, which highlighted the technique of wood carving and aimed to shine a light on contemporary artists working with the medium. Kigaku – Re(a)lize – is a continuation of this mission, showcasing the work of six Japanese artists creating today.\nAlongside pieces made within the past few years, Kigaku – Re(a)lize – includes examples of carved sacred sculptures from the Early Edo period (1603-1690) and the Heian period (794-1185). The exhibition continues through November 1. Find more on the gallery’s website.\nYoshitoshi Kanemaki, “Tiny Caprice” (2025), painted Japanese boxwood, 13.2 x 4.5 x 4.5 centimeters\nKosuke Ikeshima, “Vanitas” (2025), camphor wood, 29 x 27 x 11.5 centimeters\nAyako Kita, two views of “Public Self” (2023), Japanese cypress and acrylic resin, 33.5 x 20 x 16 centimeters\nYuta Nakazato, “Princess’s Whereabouts” (2025), Japanese cypress, 37 x 35 x 60 centimeters\nRyo Matsumoto, “kyojitsuhiniku, offering, broken skull-shinenshisou, kyojitsuhiniku, offering, mask” (2025), maple and camphor wood, 19 x 15 x 22 centimeters and 16 x 13 x 5 centimeters\nIkuo Inada, “Some things aren’t ‘whatever'” (2025), camphor wood, 58 x 18.5 x 18 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t",

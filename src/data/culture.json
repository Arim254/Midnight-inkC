    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nThe names Leo Fend­er and Les Paul will be for­ev­er asso­ci­at­ed with the explo­sion of the elec­tric gui­tar into pop­u­lar cul­ture. And right­ly so. With­out engi­neer Fend­er and musi­cian and stu­dio wiz Paul’s time­less designs, it’s hard to imag­ine what the most icon­ic instru­ments of decades of pop­u­lar music would look like.\nThey just might look like fry­ing pans.\nThough Fend­er and Paul (and the Gib­son com­pa­ny) get all the glo­ry, it’s two men named George who should right­ly get much of the cred­it for invent­ing the elec­tric gui­tar. The first, naval offi­cer George Breed, has a sta­tus vis-à-vis the elec­tric gui­tar sim­i­lar to Leonar­do da Vinci’s to the heli­copter.\nIn 1890, Breed sub­mit­ted a patent for a one-of-a-kind design, uti­liz­ing the two basic ele­ments that would even­tu­al­ly make their way into Stra­to­cast­ers and Les Pauls—a mag­net­ic pick­up and wire strings. Unfor­tu­nate­ly for Breed, his design also includ­ed some very imprac­ti­cal cir­cuit­ry and required bat­tery oper­a­tion, “result­ing in a small but extreme­ly heavy gui­tar with an uncon­ven­tion­al play­ing tech­nique,” writes the Inter­na­tion­al Reper­to­ry of Music Lit­er­a­ture, “that pro­duced an excep­tion­al­ly unusu­al and ungui­tar­like, con­tin­u­ous­ly sus­tained sound.”\n\n\n\t\n\nLike a Renais­sance fly­ing machine, the design went nowhere. That is, until George Beauchamp, a “musi­cian and tin­ker­er” from Texas, came up with a design for an elec­tric gui­tar pick­up that worked beau­ti­ful­ly. The first “Fry­ing Pan Hawai­ian” lap steel gui­tar, whose schemat­ic you can see at the top of the post, “now sits in a case in a muse­um,” writes Andre Mil­lard in his his­to­ry of the elec­tric gui­tar, “look­ing every inch the his­toric arti­fact but not much like a gui­tar.” Giz­mo­do quotes gui­tar his­to­ri­an Richard Smith, who dis­cuss­es the need in the 20s and 30s for an elec­tric gui­tar to be heard over the rhythm instru­ments in jazz and in Beauchamp’s pre­ferred style, Hawai­ian music, “where… the gui­tar was the melody instru­ment. So the real push to make the gui­tar elec­tric came from the Hawai­ian musi­cians.”\n\n\n\t\n\nBeauchamp devel­oped the gui­tar after he was fired as gen­er­al man­ag­er of the Nation­al String Instru­ment Cor­po­ra­tion. Need­ing a new project, he and anoth­er Nation­al employ­ee, Paul Barth, began exper­i­ment­ing with Breed’s ideas. After build­ing a work­ing pick­up, they called on anoth­er Nation­al employ­ee, writes Rickenbacker.com, “to make a wood­en neck and body for it. In sev­er­al hours, carv­ing with small hand tools, a rasp, and a file, the first ful­ly elec­tric gui­tar took form.” (An ear­li­er elec­tro-acoustic gui­tar—the Stromberg Elec­tro—con­tributed to ampli­fi­er tech­nol­o­gy but its awk­ward pick­up design didn’t catch on.)\n\n\n\t\n\nNeed­ing cap­i­tal, man­u­fac­tur­ing, and dis­tri­b­u­tion, Beauchamp con­tract­ed with tool­mak­er Adolph Rick­en­backer, who mass pro­duced the Fry­ing Pan as “The Rick­en­bach­er A‑22″ under the com­pa­ny name “Elec­tro String.” (The com­pa­ny became Rick­en­backer Gui­tars after its own­er sold it in the 50s.) Although the nov­el­ty of the instru­ment and its cost dur­ing the Great Depres­sion inhib­it­ed sales, Beauchamp and Rick­en­backer still pro­duced sev­er­al ver­sions of the Fry­ing Pan, with cast alu­minum bod­ies rather than wood. (See an ear­ly mod­el here.) Soon, the Fry­ing Pan became inte­grat­ed into live jazz bands (see it at the 3:34 mark above in a 1936 Adolph Zukor short film) and record­ings.\n\n\n\t\n\nHow does the Fry­ing Pan sound? Aston­ish­ing­ly good, as you can hear for your­self in the demon­stra­tion videos above. Although Rick­en­backer and oth­er gui­tar mak­ers moved on to installing pick­ups in so-called “Span­ish” guitars—hollow-bodied jazz box­es with their famil­iar f‑holes—the Fry­ing Pan lap steel con­tin­ues to have a par­tic­u­lar mys­tique in gui­tar his­to­ry, and was man­u­fac­tured and sold into the ear­ly 1950s.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe next leap for­ward in elec­tric gui­tar design? After the Fry­ing Pan came Les Paul’s first ful­ly solid­body elec­tric: The Log.\nLearn More about the inven­tion of the elec­tric gui­tar in the short Smith­son­ian video just above.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Evo­lu­tion of the Elec­tric Gui­tar: An Intro­duc­tion to Every Major Vari­ety of the Instru­ment That Made Rock-and-Roll\nThe His­to­ry of the Elec­tric Gui­tar Solo: A Sev­en-Part Series\nOxford Sci­en­tist Explains the Physics of Play­ing Elec­tric Gui­tar Solos\nHear the Bril­liant Gui­tar Work of Char­lie Chris­t­ian, Inven­tor of the Elec­tric Gui­tar Solo (1939)\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn the eigh­teenth cen­tu­ry, the read­ers of Europe went mad for epis­to­lary nov­els. France had, to name the most sen­sa­tion­al exam­ples, Mon­tesquieu’s Let­tres per­sanes, Rousseau’s Julie, and Lac­los’ Les Liaisons dan­gereuses; Ger­many, Goethe’s Die Lei­den des jun­gen Werther and Hölder­lin’s Hype­r­i­on. The Eng­lish proved espe­cial­ly insa­tiable when it came to long-form sto­ries com­posed entire­ly out of let­ters: soon after its pub­li­ca­tion in 1740, Samuel Richard­son’s Pamela — by some reck­on­ings, the first real Eng­lish nov­el — grew into an all-encom­pass­ing cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­non, which Richard­son him­self out­did eight years lat­er with Claris­sa. Alas, when the BBC sur­veyed the pub­lic two and three-quar­ter cen­turies lat­er to deter­mine the most beloved nov­el in the U.K., nei­ther of those books even made the top 100.\nWith the pos­si­ble excep­tions of Bram Stok­er’s Drac­u­la (#104) and Mary Shel­ley’s Franken­stein (#171) — two works of nine­teenth-cen­tu­ry hor­ror that make use of a vari­ety of tex­tu­al forms, let­ters includ­ed — the rank­ings pro­duced by “The Big Read” includ­ed prac­ti­cal­ly no epis­to­lary nov­els. (Nor did eigh­teenth-cen­tu­ry works of any oth­er kind make the cut.) What hap­pened to the lit­er­ary genre that had once caused such a nation­al craze? For one thing, Jane Austen hap­pened: nov­els like Pride and Prej­u­dice, Emma, and Per­sua­sion revealed just how rich a sto­ry could become when its nar­ra­tion breaks away from the pen of any char­ac­ter in par­tic­u­lar, gain­ing the abil­i­ty to know more about them than they know about them­selves. Not for noth­ing did all three of those books per­form well on The Big Read the bet­ter part of 200 years after they came out; Pride and Prej­u­dice even came in at num­ber two.\nThe top spot was tak­en by J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings tril­o­gy: an under­stand­able out­come, giv­en not just its ambi­tion but also its mas­sive and endur­ing pop­u­lar­i­ty and influ­ence. Still, one does won­der if Peter Jack­son’s block­buster film adap­ta­tions, released in the years lead­ing up to the poll, might have had some­thing to do with it. Sim­i­lar sus­pi­cions adhere to the likes of Cap­tain Corel­li’s Man­dolin (#19), Amer­i­can Psy­cho (#185), The Beach (#103), and Brid­get Jones’s Diary (#75), all of which pro­vid­ed the basis for major motion pic­tures around the turn of the mil­len­ni­um. Umber­to Eco’s The Name of the Rose, one of a scat­ter­ing of trans­lat­ed nov­els to make the list, also got the Hol­ly­wood treat­ment, but it’s worth remem­ber­ing that the book itself sold so well that its Eng­lish trans­la­tor could use his roy­al­ties to build an addi­tion to his Tus­can vil­la called the “Eco Cham­ber.”\nApart from Austen, the oth­er nov­el­ists with mul­ti­ple books on The Big Read­’s top 100 include Stephen King, who also has three; Thomas Hardy, with four; and Charles Dick­ens, with sev­en. Those are, in any case, some of the nov­el­ists for adults. The abid­ing British appre­ci­a­tion for chil­dren’s lit­er­a­ture shows in the high rank­ings of Roald Dahl, who secured a great many votes with even less­er works like The Twits and Dan­ny, the Cham­pi­on of the World; J. K. Rowl­ing, who would have ben­e­fit­ed from the height of Har­ry Pot­ter mania in any case; and the pro­lif­ic Dame Jacque­line Wil­son, whose four­teen nov­els on the list place her sec­ond only to Sir Ter­ry Pratch­et­t’s fif­teen. It could be that his com­ic-fan­ta­sy sen­si­bil­i­ty, sat­u­rat­ed with both the out­landish and the mun­dane, res­onat­ed unique­ly with the British psy­che. Or, as Pratch­ett him­self says in the BBC’s Big Read tele­vi­sion broad­cast, “it could just be that I’m quite pop­u­lar.”\nIn total, more than 750,000 read­ers par­tic­i­pat­ed in the Big Read poll.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen we think of the European colonization of Africa, one period that comes to mind is an era during the mid- to late-1800s known as the Scramble for Africa. The British, French, Spanish, and Portuguese—predominantly—had already staked control of communities in coastal areas. It was during this time that inland regions became increasingly attractive for resource extraction and the promise of further economic gain. But the so-called Scramble for Africa was far from the beginning.\nBy the 1870s, Europeans controlled one-tenth of the continent, mostly in the north, along the Mediterranean, and in the far south. The Dutch East India Company had established the first European settlement in Africa in Cape Town in 1652. But the transatlantic slave trade had already been active for nearly a century and would continue for nearly two more, during which a staggering 12.5 million or more people were put on ships—mostly to the New World.\n“Desk number 7” (2021), antique portable travel desk with leather inlay and wicker, 160 x 60 x 30 centimeters\nDuring this time, colonists wrote and conveyed all messages by hand. Small, portable, wooden desks made it possible to send letters from virtually anywhere, with fold-out surfaces covered in leather and storage areas for holding pens, nibs, and ink.\nFor artist Sonia E. Barrett, these antique desks are a tangible connection to a protracted era of cultural clashes fraught with greed, violence, and usually a one-sided telling of history. “These were the laptops of the day,” Barrett says of the portable tools that form her Desk series. “On them, they ‘wrote Africa’ in letters home, journals, and reports that now form the archives in Europe of Africa.”\nUsing pieces of reclaimed wood, leather, velvet, pens, ink, and wicker in addition to the found Edwardian writing surfaces, Barrett animates her sculptures with expressive faces redolent of African ceremonial masks. “I thought (the desks) could be a way of speaking back to Empire beyond the archived letters written on them.”\nWhile different regions and cultures across the African continent created unique masks reflective of their beliefs and traditions since time immemorial, the European fashion for collecting these objects gave rise to a commercial industry that continues today. Similar to the wooden desks covered in leather or velvet, the carved African masks were whittled from timber and embellished with leather. The mahogany used in the manufacture of the writing desk would have matured in a tropical climate, “shipped in much the same way as we were,” the artist says, referring to the international African slave trade.\nThe artist wearing “Desk number 6” (2021), lockable antique portable travel desk, mahogany, with embossed leather inlay, wicker, ink, and key, 100 x 60 x 60 centimeters\nBarrett adds wicker structures to the bases of the desks, which suggest shoulders and bodies and can also be donned loosely, as one would wear a ceremonial costume. In a sense, the pieces are like conduits or metaphysical transporters. “These heads can join with African diasporan bodies and enable us to reach back, as they enabled our ancestors,” the artist says. \nSome of Barrett’s sculptures are on display as part of The Ground Beneath: Material Memory and the Resilience of Hope at Messums London, which continues through November 15.

    "description": "\nOn July 11, Zeit Magazin editor Elisa Pfleger, through our gallery, invited me to contribute 15–20 short reflections on the prompt “What I would have",
    "body": "\nOn July 11, Zeit Magazin editor Elisa Pfleger, through our gallery, invited me to contribute 15–20 short reflections on the prompt “What I would have liked to know about Germany earlier” for an upcoming summer issue column. I subsequently wrote and submitted the piece. On July 23, in response to Zeit Magazin’s request for additional reflections in a more personal and light-hearted tone, I provided further contributions. Two days later, we were first shown a shortened and edited version by Pfleger, and then immediately afterward informed that Zeit Magazin’s Executive Editor Johannes Dudziak — Pfleger’s supervising manager — had reviewed the column, canceled its publication, and commissioned new contributions from other writers instead.\n\n“Was ich gern früher über Deutschland gewusst hätte”\nBy Ai Weiwei\nA society governed by regulations, yet lacking individual moral judgment, is more dangerous than one with none at all.\nA society that values obedience without questioning authority is destined to become corrupt.\nA society that admits to error but refuses to reflect on its origins possesses a mind as stubborn and dull as granite.\nHere, at a deserted street, people stop dutifully at a red light. Not a car in sight. This, I once thought, is the mark of a highly evolved society.\nAt the heart of bureaucracy lies a collective endorsement of power’s legitimacy, and therefore, individuals surrender their moral judgment — or perhaps never developed one. They abandon challenge. They relinquish dispute.\nWhen conversation becomes avoidance, when topics must not be mentioned, we are already living under the quiet logic of authoritarianism.\nWhen the majority believe they live in a free society, it is often a sign that the society is not free. Freedom is not a gift; it must be wrestled from the hands of banality and the quiet complicity with power.\n\nArtist Ai Weiwei (photo by Gao Yuan, courtesy Ai Weiwei Studio)\nWhen people sense that power is beyond challenge, they redirect their energy into trivial disputes. And those trivialities, collectively, are enough to erode a society’s very foundations of justice.\nWhen public events of great consequence — such as the Nord Stream Pipeline bombing — are met with silence from both government and media, the silence itself becomes more terrifying than any atomic bomb.\nFacts are acknowledged partially, forgotten deliberately, or swallowed by collective silence.And so we repeat catastrophe — again and again, in cycles.\nWhen the media becomes a servant of public opinion, or avoids conflict to maintain favor with existing powers, it becomes an accomplice to authority.\nWhat we call lies are not always distortions of fact.\nPolitical leaders make decisions steeped in fallacy and failure. This reflects the broader political condition of a society in which most people have surrendered their awareness and even their basic agency — allowing such leaders to enact their mistakes on their behalf.\nWhen a society uses linguistic difference or cultural misunderstanding as excuses for exclusion, it has crossed into a more insidious form of racism. This is not a political opinion — it is an attitude, a stain in blood, passed down like genes.\nBureaucracy is not merely sluggish. It is a cultural scorn. It rejects the possibility of dialogue. It insists that ignorance, codified into policy, no matter how wrong and inhumane it is, remains the best resistance against social mobility, against moral motion. In such a society, hope is not misplaced. It is extinguished.\nIn the surrounding atmosphere, one sees not culture, but self-congratulation; not art, but insularity and collective reverence for power. What is missing is sincerity — honesty of emotion and of intention. In such an environment, art that grapples with true human feeling or moral reckoning is nearly impossible to produce.\nA place that routinely discards self-awareness and erases individual agency is one that lives under iron walls of authoritianism.\nI have no family, no fatherland, never known what it is to belong. I belong only to myself. In the best of circumstances, that self should belong to everyone.\nI still do not know what art is. I only hope that what I make might touch its edges while it seems unrelated to anything. And in truth, in the best of circumstances it is unrelated to me, for the “I” already melts into everything.\nThose things found in galleries, museums, and collectors’ living rooms — are they art?Who has declared them so? On what basis? Why do I always feel suspicion in their presence?\nWorks that evade reality, that shy away from argument, from controversy, from debate — be they text, painting, or performance — are worthless. And strangely, it is this worthless work that society most readily celebrates.\nI understand now: People crave power and tyranny as they crave sunshine and rain, for the burden of self-awareness feels like pain. At times, even like catastrophe.\nUnder most circumstances, society selects the most selfish, least idealistic among us to take on the work we call “art” because that choice makes everyone feel safe.\n\nZusätzlich (Additionally):\nIn Berlin, I encounter the ever-present Schweinshaxe and Schnitzel, and I can hardly believe that such a highly developed, industrialized country offers such a monotonous selection of ingredients. Even more baffling is the sudden proliferation of Chinese restaurants — most of them noodle-based, and operating at a culinary level that any Chinese person could easily achieve at home. The variety of food and cooking methods is so limited here that people from all over the world feel compelled to open restaurants: Vietnamese, Thai, Turkish — you name it.\nBut the truly horrifying part? The sheer number of Chinese restaurants. I can only assume they believe that no matter what ends up on the plate, German customers will come running. In front of some of these establishments, there are even long queues — yet the food they serve bears little resemblance to anything recognizably Chinese.\nMy favorite food in Germany is the bread and sausage — you simply can’t find ones with such distinctive character anywhere else.\n I’m puzzled by why so many people would willingly cram themselves into a small bar just to have a long conversation. Since I don’t speak the language, I can only imagine that the young people coming to Berlin would talk about clubbing. This sort of thing was all the rage in the US back in the ’70s and ’80s.\nThe Germans might be the only people who are truly the furthest from a sense of humor. This could be the result of their deep reverence for rationality. Just look at Berlin Airport or the advertisements for Mercedes-Benz cars — you start to feel that their lack of humor has become a kind of immense humor in itself.\n\t",

(photo by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThieves stole “priceless” jewels from a gallery in the Louvre Museum in Paris in broad daylight on Sunday, October 19.\nLaurent Nuñez, France’s interior minister, told France Inter that burglars broke into the Galerie d’Apollon around 9:30am, half an hour after the museum opened to the public, and made off with the pieces in a span of just seven minutes before fleeing on motorcycles.\nThe Louvre’s d’Apollon gallery is known for its opulent displays of France’s crown jewels. Among the eight stolen items, according to a list from the Ministry of Culture shared with Hyperallergic, are several pieces from an early 19th-century set belonging to Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, including a sapphire and diamond tiara. A pair of emerald earrings and matching necklace, gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise of Austria on the occasion of their marriage, were also taken.\n“Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value,” a spokesperson for the Louvre said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “All possible measures are being taken to recover the stolen items.”\nOne of the jewels targeted by the thieves — the diamond-encrusted crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III — was later recovered outside the museum. However, the burglars managed to make off with Eugénie’s pearl and diamond tiara.\nThe Galerie d’Apollon at the Louvre Museum (photo by Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe Louvre spokesperson said that no injuries were reported, and that the French government has enlisted a specialized police force to investigate the robbery. The Louvre remained closed on Sunday “as a security measure and to preserve evidence for the investigation.”\nThe thieves allegedly used a mechanical ladder known as a basket lift to access the second-floor gallery, forced a window, and smashed the display cases in what Nuñez described as an expert operation executed by professionals. Five security officers were present in the gallery at the time, the Ministry of Culture’s statement said.\n“We saw some footage, they don’t target people, they enter calmly in four minutes, smash display cases, take their loot, and leave. No violence, very professional,” Culture Minister Rachida Dati told the French news channel TF1.\nTourists in line to enter the museum this morning told the BBC that security guards quickly ushered them out shortly after the incident. \nFrench police officers stand next to a mechanical ladder used by robbers to break into the Louvre Museum, on Quai Francois Mitterrand, in Paris on October 19, 2025. (photo by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe Louvre, which is the world’s most visited museum, drawing approximately 30,000 visitors per day, is no stranger to art heists. In 1911, one of its own employees notoriously made off with the Mona Lisa. He was arrested years later and the painting was returned. More recently, in 1998, a painting by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was snatched directly from a wall. It has never been found.\nToday’s incident comes just months after a mass work stoppage shuttered the museum for several hours this summer, with striking employees citing poor working conditions, overcrowding, and staff shortages at the iconic institution. \nEarlier this year, President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a decade-long renovation project that would revitalize the Louvre’s outdated infrastructure and create a dedicated gallery for the Mona Lisa, the museum’s top tourist draw. The overhaul plan also includes a “new security master plan,” the Ministry of Culture said today, including enhanced safety measures and perimeter detection technology.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValentina Di Liscia is the News Editor at Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTakako Yamaguchi, \"Stitch\" (2023), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 42 × 50 inches (106.7 × 127 cm) (all photos David S. Rubin/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nWhat makes a seascape? In this focus exhibition of 10 recent paintings at the Museum of Contemporary Art, veteran Los Angeles artist Takako Yamaguchi subverts the traditional notion. Rather than base her imagery on observations of the natural world, she takes the opposite approach and practices what she calls “abstraction in reverse.” Recognizing that early European and American Modernists derived their geometric or organic forms from nature, she instead begins by using abstract shapes to construct calm seascapes, with horizon lines bisecting each composition into two equal sections. She superimposes additional abstract imagery reflecting her love of pattern and decoration, fashion, and her concept of beauty, some loaded with symbolic associations.\nIn “Stitch” (2023), a brown rectangle suggests the presence of a beachfront, the ocean is divided into horizontal registers made up of undulating lines and interlocking zigzags, and clouds have been replaced by an expansive braid that the walls points out recalls a close-up of those feminized materials of hair or fabric. Easily perceived as separate elements, Yamaguchi’s abstract and figurative configurations do not really interact. Rather, they peacefully coexist as two worlds in one, as nature and culture.\n\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Trap” (2024), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 60 × 40 inches (152.4 × 101.6 cm)\nYamaguchi’s image lexicon also includes architectural columns, fountains, and geometric patterns derived from historical Japanese art, as in Ukiyo-e prints or folding screens. The latter influence is particularly evident in “Trap” (2024), where swirling cloud formations inhabit the sky and rhythmic waves swirl in the center like the codependent halves of a yin-yang symbol. A similar effect is at play in “Accomplice” (2025), where two Greek columns have been whimsically anthropomorphized such that they appear to be snuggling.\nIndeed, Yamaguchi is at her best when letting her imagination run rampant. This might be most clearly seen in her fantastic biomorphic creatures that seem to have risen from the ocean depths, blocking our views of distant horizons. Hybrids of architectural motifs and feminine symbols, such as flowing hair or wombs, the vibrant, energetic biomorphs in “Guide” (2023), “Pilot” (2024), and “Plenum” (2024) occupy entire foregrounds, commanding our attention like actors on a stage, the seascape behind functioning like a scenic backdrop. Delightfully surreal, these creatures evoke associations with Japanese anime and classic horror films. By contrast, the decorative structures in “Procession” and “Font” (both 2024) function more like gateways through which we can envision journeying across the waters. \nMelding abstraction with figuration through an idiosyncratic language that draws from Euroamerican Modernism and Japanese woodblock prints and pop culture alike, Yamaguchi effectively liberates herself from such distinctions, creating fresh compositions that are at once serene and animated.\n\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Guide” (2023), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 42 × 50 inches (106.7 × 127 cm)\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Font” (2024), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 60 × 40 inches (152.4 × 101.6 cm)\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Accomplice” (2025), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 50 × 42 inches (127 × 106.7 cm)\nMOCA Focus: Takako Yamaguchi continues at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (250 South Grand Avenue, Downtown Los Angeles) through January 4, 2026.

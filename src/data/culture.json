    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tDecember 5th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt would be impos­si­ble to under­stand West­ern civ­i­liza­tion with­out under­stand­ing the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ty. But in order to do that, it may serve us well to think of it as the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ties, plur­al. So sug­gests Hochela­ga cre­ator Tom­mie Trelawny in the new video above, which explains the Gnos­tic Gospels, the “for­bid­den teach­ings of Jesus.” As a sys­tem of beliefs, Gnos­ti­cism is a fair­ly far cry from the main­stream forms of Chris­tian­i­ty with which most of us are famil­iar today. But its sur­viv­ing texts may sound uncan­ni­ly famil­iar, despite also involv­ing out­landish-sound­ing ele­ments that seem to belong to anoth­er civ­i­liza­tion entire­ly. Gnos­tic teach­ings have long been con­sid­ered heresy by Chris­tians, but do they real­ly rep­re­sent just a dif­fer­ent evo­lu­tion­ary branch of the faith: anoth­er Chris­tian­i­ty?\nReli­gious schol­ars of many stripes have con­cerned them­selves with few mat­ters as inten­sive­ly as they have with theod­i­cy, that is, the mat­ter of how to square the notion of a good, omnipo­tent deity with the obvi­ous exis­tence of evil down here in the world. Since its loose coali­tion of beliefs came togeth­er in the late first cen­tu­ry, Gnos­ti­cism has pro­posed an ele­gant solu­tion: that the deity is not, in fact, good, or rather, that under the tran­scen­dent, unknow­able God is a much more poor­ly behaved “demi­urge” who dis­plays an indif­fer­ence, at best, to the lot of human­i­ty. In this view, our result­ing world is less a per­fect cre­ation than a cos­mic mis­take — a propo­si­tion that would account for cer­tain of its qual­i­ties we expe­ri­ence on the day-to-day lev­el, even if we have no par­tic­u­lar reli­gious pro­cliv­i­ties.\nThanks to the dis­cov­ery of Egyp­t’s Nag Ham­ma­di library in 1945, we can direct­ly access many of the teach­ings of the so-called “Gnos­tic Gospels.” They tell us, to make a few grand sim­pli­fi­ca­tions, that our real­i­ty is illu­so­ry and that we can only come to grasp the true nature of both it and our­selves through eso­teric learn­ing, gno­sis being the ancient Greek term for knowl­edge. This world­view may bring to mind that of cer­tain Greek philoso­phers, or indeed that of The Matrix, a near-oblig­a­tory ref­er­ence for a video like this. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry on from that movie, it’s not hard to under­stand why it res­onat­ed with the siz­able-enough pro­por­tion of human­i­ty who feel alien­at­ed from who they real­ly are or what the world real­ly is — and who, any mil­len­ni­um now, would make rea­son­ably promis­ing can­di­dates to bring about a Gnos­tic revival.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n3,500 Occult Man­u­scripts Will Be Dig­i­tized & Made Freely Avail­able Online, Thanks to The Da Vin­ci Code Author Dan Brown\nBehold the Codex Gigas (aka “Devil’s Bible”), the Largest Medieval Man­u­script in the World\nThe Phi­los­o­phy of The Matrix: From Pla­to and Descartes, to East­ern Phi­los­o­phy\nThe Ancient Greeks Who Con­vert­ed to Bud­dhism\nDis­cov­er Thomas Jefferson’s Cut-and-Paste Ver­sion of the Bible, and Read the Curi­ous Edi­tion Online\nHow Our Depic­tion of Jesus Changed Over 2,000 Years and What He May Have Actu­al­ly Looked Like\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLocated in the Yangtze River Delta, Hangzhou is enmeshed in waterways. The city’s center abuts a large lake and sits just north of the Qiantang River, infamous for its magnificent tidal bore that sweeps through the region each fall.\nFor their latest project presented in the Hangzhou Triennial of Fiber Art at Zhejiang Art Museum, Jin Choi and Thomas Shine merged aspects of this local environment and culture with their distinctive process. The artists, who work as Choi + Shine Architects, often create sweeping lace isntallations crocheted in partnership with local communities. Choi typically designs the motif, while Shine focuses on the structure itself. \n\nSuspended above reflective surface mimicking a dark body of water, “Distance” comprises crocheted sculptures representing all 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac. “As society evolves, [the zodiac] continues to find relevance, connecting to the wisdom of the past and the shared narratives that shape our identities today,” the artists write. “Its legacy, with its rich symbolism, cultural significance and unifying power, will endure as a navigational tool in the current and future social shifts.”\nRather than depict a dog or rabbit in its entirety, Choi isolated elements of each animal—find preliminary sketches and reference imagery on the artists’ website. The ox, for example, is represented through a slender tube evocative of a horn, while the rooster can be spotted through a fan-like plume. \nThe installation’s structure is circular and appears to shift depending on the viewer’s perpseicve. “The composition loses its legible visual order and the elements start to form different relations, allowing for varying compositions,” the artists say. This emphasizes “one’s power to position oneself in reference to others, to actively define different connections and relationships.”\nAs for the making-of, Choi + Shine know that community members come to their collaborative process with varying levels of craft experience. Their projects often become educational sessions in addition to community gatherings, as participants demonstrate a particular stitch or help troubleshoot issues. \n\n“Many volunteers are actually novices in crochet, and there are many complex patterns. They may not be very good at crochet, so we are in the process of communicating and collaborating. Beginners and skilled volunteers help each other,” said Wu Qin, who led volunteer efforts for this isntallation.\n“Distance” is now permanently isntalled at the Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen we look at a leaf, we see a predominantly flat plane, intersected by a midrib and myriad veins, or perhaps dotted with ailments like fungi or the eggs of insects. But imagine what these bits of foliage would look like if blown up like balloons. Artist Syd Carpenter responds “to the garden as a source of form” with her Expanded Leaf series. Imagining a papery leaf if it were inflated, perhaps to the size of a cat, the resulting forms take on “the girth, weight and physicality of animals,” she says.\nCarpenter is known for her clay-based practice exploring the body, land, agriculture, and African American history. She taps into the ancient legacy of the material, merging the timeless medium with contemporary concerns. Perception and expectations are thoughtfully challenged as we encounter bulbous, creature-like beings that simultaneously seem alive and inanimate.\n“Indiana Hutson” (2021), clay, 11 x 24 x 23 inches\n\nIn her recent Farm Bowl series, Carpenter considers another enduring juxtaposition, especially in the world of craft: form and function. She transforms the ubiquitous shape of a bowl into a series of tableaux that delve into relationships between African Americans and the land. Investigating ideas of utility, labor, place, and narrative, the sculptures are encircled by farm animals, foodstuffs, modest houses, and fences.\n“The handmade bowl is a universal form with equivalent examples represented in every culture,” Carpenter says in a statement. “It is an open, round form with an inner recessed chamber rising from a smaller foot to a wider rim. Bowls can serve ritualistically or as mundane, utilitarian objects.” In their nearly universal applications and ageless form, the bowl provides a unique way of “holding” African American experiences and connections to the land.\nA major retrospective of Carpenter’s work, Planting in Space, Time, and Memory, opens in January at the Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia. Running concurrently, another solo show titled Home Bound in Wood, Steel, and Clay runs from January 22 to April 5 at the Berman Museum of Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. Her work is also included in the group exhibition Re-Union: Syd Carpenter, Martha Jackson Jarvis, Judy Moonelis, Sana Musasama, and Winnie Owens Hart at the Frances M. Maguire Art Museum of Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, from January 14 to March 29.\nIf you’re in Washington, D.C., you can also see Carpenter’s ceramics in State Fairs: Growing American Craft at the Smithsonian’s Renwick Gallery, which continues through September 7.

Her most recent paintings, created during the past three years, reflect Blitt’s deepening connection with the natural world around her, building on core themes within her practice while reaching new levels of intimacy and nuance. Central to her approach is the conviction that line possesses an animating energy — each brushstroke, drawn gesture, or fusion of color embodies a sense of momentum and fluidity, as if capturing the choreography of nature itself.Throughout the decades, Blitt has consistently drawn inspiration from nature, family, music, and movement, aiming to transform the everyday beauty of neighborhood gardens and trees into expansive contemplations on growth, renewal, and the cyclical nature of life. Through painting, she turns fleeting glimpses of the everyday into meditations on the universal, hoping to remind viewers of nature’s endless potential for artistic transformation. Blitt’s signature style, where movement and color form a contrapuntal interdependence, intends for the local to become universal and the transient to become enduring.“Thinking of Trees IV” (2025) encapsulates these ideas. In this painting, Blitt’s commitment as a colorist is evident: radiant hues envelop energetic lines, echoing her landscapes of the 1960s and the luminous “Ovals” of the 1980s. “Thinking of Trees IV” demonstrates how she infuses color to create atmosphere, layering tones to evoke the shifting light and changing seasons. Sinuous lines suggest tree branches swaying in the breeze, their energy extending beyond the canvas. A visual symphony, harmonies of line and color resonate with the emotional and sensory registers of the natural world, reaffirming Blitt’s effort to translate the essence of nature into vibrant visual music.Find more information on the exhibition at leedy-voulkos.com, and learn about the artist at ritablitt.com.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSponsored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExhibition Announcement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMissouri\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

One clause of the bill states that the measure would help create secondary income streams for visual artists, who are among Canada’s lowest earners and, like artists in the United States, currently do not receive royalties if their work's value increases after its initial sale.Proponents of the measure say royalties will allow artists to benefit from their career growth over time, and that it will particularly benefit Indigenous artists whose work is “commonly exploited on the secondary market,” according to the nonprofit Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des artistes canadiens (CARFAC). A similar bid for royalties failed in Canada in 2022. Artist's Resale Right (ARR) is commonly recognized by countries in the European Union, entitling artists to a cut of each subsequent sale of their artworks. In France, for example, artists can pocket 3% an art sale of between €50,000 €200,000 ($58,189.50 and $232,758). In the United Kingdom, a work must sell for at least £1,000, and royalties are capped at £12,500 (~$1,332.51 and ~$16,657.34, respectively). The UK law applies to artists during their lifetime and for the 70 years following their death. The United States does not currently recognize a federal Artist’s Resale Right, and a California law implementing up to 5% in royalties for artists was struck down in 2018 after a federal judge ruled that federal copyright laws prevented the measure. The Canadian government has not announced specific royalties yet, nor a timeline for the implementation of an Artist’s Resale Right. A spokesperson for the Department of Canadian Heritage told Hyperallergic that amendments to the country's copyright laws will be brought forth “at the earliest possible opportunity, with details to be made public when the bill is tabled.” The spokesperson added that the government expects the budget bill to support Indigenous artists, who make up 4.1% of visual artists in the country and are most highly represented in the visual arts, as compared to other creative disciplines.April Britski, CARFAC's national executive director, believes that artists in Canada could receive between CA$3 and CA$5 million in total royalties annually (~$2.13 and $3.55 million) under an official Artist's Resale Right. The organization has issued a proposal recommending that the government implement 5% royalties on all works selling for at least CA$1,000 (~$721.07). “[The Artist's Resale Right] is particularly beneficial for Indigenous and senior artists, and it is a critical step forward in improving the economic conditions of Canadian artists,” Britski told Hyperallergic in an email.CARFAC’s website cites late Inuk artist Kenojuak Ashevak’s sale of editions of her stonecut print “Enchanted Owl” (1960) in support of an Artist's Resale Right. An edition was later resold for CA$216,000 (~$156,131.50) in 2018, and one is now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Neither Ashevak nor her estate received any of the profits from the resale of her work.“There can often be a huge markup on secondary sales of their work, so ARR is an important opportunity for economic reconciliation,” Britski continued.A second budget bill with further details about the copyright amendments and resale right is expected to reach the House of Commons later in the winter, according to Britski.“We're not quite there, but it is coming, and Canadian artists will soon be able to share in the profits made on their work in the secondary market,” Britski said. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Canada\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

As part of a three-year investigation that will inform upcoming restoration work, archaeologists discovered 60 flint flakes they believe were used as tools around 4,300 BCE during the Mesolithic or early Neolithic period. The archaeologists also uncovered additional items, including 800-year-old footwear and a 19th-century beer jug. The group noted that the flint artifacts predate Stonehenge's earliest earthworks by 1,000 years. At Stonehenge, flint tools are believed to have been used to chip and shape stone. The flint artifacts, said the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority in a press release, originated from the now-gone Thorney Island, formed by the once intersecting Thames and River Tyburn. Prehistoric people, archaeologists said, used that island stretch for fishing, hunting, and food gathering. The objects were discovered in the Cromwell Green section of the property.Flint artifacts believed to be 6,000 years old (image courtesy Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority)The discovery comes as parliament weighs costly options for the much-needed restoration of the building. Parliament was expected to vote on a final plan for the restoration of the palace later this year, but the process appears to be delayed again as members contend with a multibillion-pound price tag on the renewal. Proponents for urgent restoration caution against increasing fire risk to the building as it ages. Over the last decade, there were a reported 44 fires in the building. Judith Cummins MP, Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority board chair, said in a statement that the discovery came as part of inquiries into the building's history as it prepares for a major renovation \"to understand more about the building and the thousands of years of history underneath the home of Parliament.\" Nine areas of the Westminster campus are subject to the investigations, including the Royal Court, Speaker’s Court, and the Thames River shoreline. The discovery comes ahead of an expected restoration of the historic palace.\"It is vital we continue these investigations to understand what lies beneath the ground here at an early stage to inform and guide decisions on design and further surveys ahead of future enabling and construction works,\" Diane Abrams, the lead archaeologist for the investigations, said in a statement. \"This ensures the site’s extraordinary heritage and archaeology is managed appropriately while enabling the safe and efficient delivery of the Restoration and Renewal Programme.”Earlier this year, archaeologists at the site uncovered part of a medieval two-story hall from 1167, believed to have burnt completely in the 19th century, which once served as a dining area and as the Court of Chancery, the Court of Requests, and for parliamentary functions. In a statement, the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority said this previous discovery had been the most important of the group's work to date.The investigations will carry on through 2026, and a final report on the group's findings will be released in 2027.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tDecember 1st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhile not every Open Cul­ture read­er dreams of mov­ing to Japan and becom­ing a wood­block print­mak­er, it’s a safe bet that at least a few of you enter­tain just such a fan­ta­sy from time to time. David Bull, a British-Born Cana­di­an who got his first expo­sure to the art of ukiyo‑e in his late twen­ties, actu­al­ly did it. Though he’s been liv­ing in Japan and steadi­ly pur­su­ing his art there since 1986, only in recent years has he become known around the world. That’s thanks to his YouTube chan­nel, which we’ve fea­tured here sev­er­al times before. In the video above, one of his most pop­u­lar, he lets his view­ers expe­ri­ence print­mak­ing from his point of view, see­ing what he sees and even hear­ing what he hears.\nThough Bull nor­mal­ly focus­es on the ear­ly stage carv­ing images into the blocks, here he spends about an hour on the final print­ing phase, going through a batch of eight sheets. As even a few min­utes’ view­ing reveals, this is a labor-inten­sive and thor­ough­ly ana­log process.\nThat impres­sion will be height­ened if you wear head­phones, since, as Bull explains, he shot the video while wear­ing in-ear micro­phones that record the sounds of the job just as he hears them. This par­tic­u­lar aspect of the pro­duc­tion required him to rise con­sid­er­ably ear­li­er than usu­al, in order to avoid the con­sid­er­able day­time noise on the streets of Tokyo right out­side his work­shop — and thus to more ful­ly sat­is­fy the large ASMR crowd.\nThe term ASMR, or “Autonomous Sen­so­ry Merid­i­an Response,” refers to a set of pleas­ing sen­sa­tions trig­gered by cer­tain kinds of sound, often those pro­duced by soft-spo­ken indi­vid­u­als like Bull or the kind of repet­i­tive, method­i­cal tool work he does. Chances are, many if not most of the almost 950,000 views this video has racked up so far have come from ASMR enthu­si­asts less inter­est­ed in Japan­ese wood­block print­ing per se than in the gen­er­al aes­thet­ic expe­ri­ence of watch­ing and lis­ten­ing to Japan­ese wood­block print­ing — at least at first. We all know how life can go: one day you’re check­ing out YouTube, just look­ing to relax, and the next you’re ensconced in Asakusa, hav­ing whol­ly devot­ed your­self to a three-and-a-half-mil­len­ni­um-year-old tra­di­tion­al art form.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch the Mak­ing of Japan­ese Wood­block Prints, from Start to Fin­ish, by a Long­time Tokyo Print­mak­er\nEnter a Dig­i­tal Archive of 213,000+ Beau­ti­ful Japan­ese Wood­block Prints\nA Col­lec­tion of Hokusai’s Draw­ings Are Being Carved Onto Wood­blocks & Print­ed for the First Time Ever\nWatch an Art Con­ser­va­tor Bring Clas­sic Paint­ings Back to Life in Intrigu­ing­ly Nar­rat­ed Videos\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tDecember 1st, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nFor young chil­dren today, just as it was for gen­er­a­tions of their pre­de­ces­sors, noth­ing is quite so thrilling about their first vis­it to a Dis­ney theme park as catch­ing a glimpse of Mick­ey Mouse, Don­ald Duck, or anoth­er beloved char­ac­ter greet­ing them in real life. Cre­at­ing this mem­o­rable expe­ri­ence requires noth­ing more advanced than a well-trained employ­ee (or “cast mem­ber,” as the com­pa­ny puts it) in an over­sized cos­tume. Nev­er­the­less, effec­tive though it may be, it was­n’t part of Walt Dis­ney’s long-term vision. A true man of the Space Age, he looked ahead to the time — sure­ly not all too far in the future — when he could instead fill Dis­ney­land with reli­able, untir­ing, per­fect­ly life­like robots in the shape of ani­mals, human beings, or any­thing else besides.\nIn the event, Dis­ney only lived long enough to see his peo­ple cre­ate a mechan­i­cal ver­sion of Abra­ham Lin­coln, whose abil­i­ties were lim­it­ed to stand­ing up from his chair and deliv­er­ing a short speech. By the time that “audio-ani­ma­tron­ic” res­ur­rec­tion of the Unit­ed States’ six­teenth pres­i­dent was first pub­licly shown at the 1964 New York World’s Fair, its rumored devel­op­ment had already set off a num­ber of eth­i­cal and aes­thet­ic con­tro­ver­sies. Yet it worked so well — at least after its ear­ly, embar­rass­ing tech­ni­cal dif­fi­cul­ties were ironed out — that some atten­dees assumed that they were look­ing at an actor dressed up as Lin­coln, and even won­dered if the poor fel­low got tired doing the same rou­tine all day long.\nThis sto­ry is includ­ed in the video above from Defunct­land, a YouTube chan­nel that focus­es on amuse­ment-park-relat­ed fail­ures, espe­cial­ly those con­nect­ed with the Dis­ney empire. The Great Moments with Mr. Lin­coln show was a suc­cess, as was the all-robot­ic Hall of Pres­i­dents that opened at Dis­ney­land in 1971, a few years after Dis­ney’s death. But try as it might — and spend as much as it will — the com­pa­ny has yet to real­ize the vision that came to obsess its founder: in effect, that of cre­at­ing tech­no­log­i­cal life. Of course, Dis­ney was hard­ly the first to enter­tain such Promethean ambi­tions: mankind had already been try­ing to pull that trick off for quite some time, as evi­denced by the efforts, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, of minds like Leonar­do da Vin­ci and the medieval poly­math Al-Jazari.\n\n\n\t\n\nTo explain Dis­ney’s long, frus­trat­ed quest to cre­ate arti­fi­cial human beings — or mice, as the case may be — requires a good deal of his­tor­i­cal, eco­nom­ic, tech­no­log­i­cal, and even philo­soph­i­cal con­text. That’s just what Defunct­land cre­ator Kevin Per­jur­er does, and then some, in the doc­u­men­tary that com­pris­es the ear­li­er video from last year and its just-released sec­ond part above. Over its col­lec­tive run­time of six hours, he goes deep into a ques­tion of great inter­est to Dis­ney enthu­si­asts: what, exact­ly, has pre­vent­ed the most ambi­tious enter­tain­ment com­pa­ny in the world from per­fect­ing its automa­tons, even here in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry? But then, as those of us of a cer­tain age who have fond mem­o­ries of the rel­a­tive­ly crude likes of the Haunt­ed Man­sion and Pirates of the Caribbean (to say noth­ing of  non-Dis­ney oper­a­tions like Chuck. E Cheese) under­stand, per­fec­tion isn’t always the way to a child’s heart.\nvia Boing Boing\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nA Medieval Ara­bic Man­u­script Fea­tures the Designs for a “Per­pet­u­al Flute” and Oth­er Inge­nious Mechan­i­cal Devices\nThe Armored-Knight “Robot” Designed by Leonar­do da Vin­ci (cir­ca 1495)\n200-Year-Old Robots That Play Music, Shoot Arrows & Even Write Poems: Watch Automa­tons in Action\nThe First-Ever Look at the Orig­i­nal Dis­ney­land Prospec­tus\nDis­ney­land 1957: A Lit­tle Stroll Down Mem­o­ry Lane\nA Map of the Dis­ney Enter­tain­ment Empire Reveals the Deep Con­nec­tions Between Its Movies, Its Mer­chan­dise, Dis­ney­land & More (1967)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nEnigmatic landscapes and metaphysical scenes unfold in the work of Gideon Kiefer. On canvas and panel, the artist paints countrysides dotted with small fires, pensive figures, and natural phenomena seemingly detached from reality by varying degrees, such as a wave crashing inside of an architectural enclosure or a chunk of purple-tinted landscape floating inside of a celestial cube.\nKiefer is interested in the nature of time and the way we mark its passing. Many of the mysterious notations and framing devices he adds around his esoteric tableaux resemble quickly-scribbled notes, as if for remembering something important, or poetic extracts from diary entries.\n“B MF B”\nAt first glance, Kiefer’s scenes often present an initial sense of familiarity or recognition, but the longer one studies the composition, comprehension is gradually dismantled. Notes in the margins may or may not feel relevant, like a doodle on the edge of a document. Or perhaps the phrases and numbers are clues to some arcane puzzle, in which Kiefer presents seemingly disparate pieces for us to try to reassemble.\nWithin his spatially strange compositions, Kiefer incorporates themes around the climate crisis. As sea levels rise due to melting ice caps and weather patterns change due to warmer temperatures—among myriad other effects—ecological changes and disruptions increasingly affect not only the planet’s flora and fauna but our own communities.\nIn Kiefer’s atmospheric paintings, stormy waves, mercurial skies, monumental icebergs, and intense fires mirror how the planet is transforming. His pieces also consider how we remember both what has already happened to the planet and acknowledge what is happening right now.\nSee more on the artist’s website and Instagram.\n“The Wave” \n“Dead Rabbit”\n“The Fucking-Up Ritual”\n“Stop Fucking Around, Start Fucking Around”\n“Don’t Bang the Drum”\n“FILIP”\n“Parasite Killing Host”\n“Ich Möchte Ein Eisberg Sein”\n“Der Sohn”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo by Christoph Welkovits, all courtesy Leitz Photographica Auction)\n    \n        \n            Say formaggio!A blindingly white-and-silver Leica camera owned by the late Pope Francis sold at a European auction this weekend for about $7.5 million, nearly 100 times its estimate.It was one of the most expensive Leica models ever sold, according to Leitz Photographica Auction, which announced it would auction the Pope’s mechanical camera for charity in September. The record is still held by a 100-year-old prototype that sold for $16.7 million in 2022.The camera company presented a personalized Leica M-A film camera and its Noctilus-M 50 mm lens to his holiness last year. In a statement, the auction house said Pope Francis had decided to auction the Leica and donate the proceeds “in keeping with his commitment to charity and social causes.”The camera was gifted to the pontiff before he passed away last year.The camera kit features several unique elements that distinguish it from its base model, which retails for about $6,300 for the body and another $8,500 for the lens, before taxes. It carries a distinctive serial number of 5000000, which is valuable to collectors, and its white-painted top plate includes an engraving with Pope Francis’s motto miserando atque eligendo (which translates to “by having mercy and choosing,” drawn from a homily on the call of Saint Matthew by Saint Bede the Venerable). The flash cover is engraved with the keys of Peter. Both the body and lens caps are engraved with the Coat of Arms of the State of Vatican City, and the camera and lens include an etching that reads \"AD MMXXIV,\" the year Leica presented the Pope with the gift in Roman numerals. The white-painted top plate is engraved with Pope Francis's motto.It’s unclear whether Pope Francis got to use his camera much, but he didn’t own it very long. He passed away this spring at the age of 88, several months after receiving the gift.  Though the pontiff did not specifically express his views on photography, he was a vocal supporter of art and artists. “Architects and painters, sculptors and musicians, filmmakers and writers, photographers and poets, artists of every discipline, are called to make beauty shine,” he said during a 2016 address to the Pontifical Academies, “especially where darkness and greyness dominate everyday life.” \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Auctions\n                      \n                      \n                        Pope Francis\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Yet the art form reached its zenith in the later Middle Ages, with the rise of the great cathedrals. Before the broad availability of paper, designs began with the vidimus — Latin for “we have seen” — crafted with wood and chalk. By the early 16th century, according to the Victoria & Albert Museum, paper allowed for a separation — one person could illustrate the design, and these designs “could be saved, reused and handed down from glazier to glazier. This made stained glass an exceptionally collaborative art.”In Light of Innocence, a stained glass solo exhibition by Raúl de Nieves, currently on view at Pioneer Works, is also in many ways a collaboration — across tarot, Mexican folklore, and Catholicism, as de Nieves draws from these visual traditions to create a grand cathedral in the central gallery. By installing art with strongly spiritual and religious connotations, he’s transformed the space from a creative one to a contemplative one.Installation view of Raúl de Nieves: In Light of InnocenceWhen I arrived, I immediately gazed upward at the far back wall, where a calavera, or skull, occupies the top circular window. Figures signifying faith, hope, and love adorn the rectangular windows below. Just beneath them is a large installation of windows powered by a lightbox that includes depictions of flies, skeletons, steps under an archway, and the Mesoamerican deity Tlaltecuhtli. As the exhibition text notes, “Unlike traditional religious hierarchies, tarot allows for multiple perspectives and characters to hold equal power.” And unlike a traditional cathedral, the second and third floors of Pioneer Works allow visitors to view the stained glass rows directly and from above, rather than just from below. The lightbox can be seen at eye level by climbing to the top floor and looking down on the installation.This enables, for example, a closer look at a set of three panels featuring a figure that looks like a blend of the Queen of Cups and Queen of Swords, another figure that resembles the meditative King of Pentacles, and a panel that reads “And we are here to contemplate the wonders of life.”Installation view of central stained glass sequence in Raúl de Nieves: In Light of Innocence.It’s a rare experience to be able to look downward at stained glass. From below, these panels evoke judgment and command, as if the gods of tarot themselves were reminding me of my purpose in life. From above, they are all too human, as confused and bewildered about the fact of existence as I am.Flies, a surprising motif in stained glass, appear on the three adjacent panels. Back down on the ground, I got a better sense of their significance. One panel titled “The flies will lay their eggs” — an apparent reference to lyrics from Marilyn Manson’s “Tourniquet” — sits alongside another one with a figure of the Hanged Man tarot card. In New York City, flies might be associated with garbage and decay, rather than spiritual insight, but they have tremendous ecological importance as bridges between death and life. This feels, in many ways, like the very message of de Nieves’s installation. Death, life, faith, hope, love, calaveras, flies, and the royalty of tarot — their meanings all lay in how we shift our perspective.Installation view of Raúl de Nieves: In Light of Innocence featuring the stained glass sequence with the Queen of Cups, Queen of Swords, King of Pentacles, and “And we are here to contemplate the wonders of life.”Installation view of Raúl de Nieves: In Light of Innocence featuring panels with a focus on flies.Installation view of Raúl de Nieves: In Light of Innocence featuring a window with a calavera image.Raúl de Nieves: In Light of Innocence continues at Pioneer Works (159 Pioneer Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn) through December 14.

As journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones delivered a sharp lecture beneath Nina Chanel Abney's monumental installations, it became clear that this Medieval city was presenting narratives of Black American life that the United States is increasingly unwilling to hold. Jacob Lawrence: African American Modernist and Nina Chanel Abney: Heaven's Hotline opened in Amersfoort on the same evening. Together, Lawrence's historical narratives and Abney's bold indictments mapped the breadth of Black American artistic vision in a way that felt both clarifying and impossible to ignore.In fact, this year, four major European museums simultaneously staged ambitious exhibitions of Black American artists: Kerry James Marshall at London's Royal Academy, Lawrence at Kunsthal KAdé in Amersfoort, Abney in Paris and Amersfoort, and Mickalene Thomas at Les Abattoirs in Toulouse and forthcoming at the Grand Palais in Paris, all shows I visited with the exception of the first. This moment feels less like a coincidence and more like a long-overdue reckoning.Visitor looking at Augusta Savage's bronze cast of \"Gwendolyn Knight\" (1935) in Jacob Lawrence: African American Modernist at Kunsthal KAdé (photo © Mike Bink; image courtesy Kunsthal KAdé)These are not demure gallery shows. They are massive institutional commitments — entire floors and, in some cases, entire museums devoted to a single artist with hundreds of works spanning decades. These shows refuse simplification as they document Black American life, histories, love, resistance, queerness, labor, death, and joy without apology or translation.At Kunsthal KAdé, Dutch audiences are encountering Jacob Lawrence in his first European overview. The museum also commissioned four new portraits of Lawrence by contemporary artist Barbara Earl Thomas, his friend and former student at the University of Washington in Seattle.It's a striking contradiction: These groundbreaking shows and unprecedented opportunities for iconic Black American artists in Europe come at the exact moment that American institutional capacity, social infrastructure, and constitutional protections are collapsing in tandem.Jacob Lawrence, Genesis series (1989), silkscreen prints, at the Kunsthal KAdé in Amersfoort, Netherlands (photo © Mike Bink; image courtesy Kunsthal KAdé)In July, Amy Sherald withdrew her exhibition American Sublime from the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery after it reportedly deemed her painting of a Black transgender woman as the Statue of Liberty too controversial. And according to the American Alliance of Museums, one-third of museums in the United States have lost federal funding since Trump took office, with around one in four slashing programs for underserved communities.It's within this climate of censorship, disinvestment, and erasure at home that Kerry James Marshall's exhibition at the Royal Academy in London takes on even sharper resonance. Here, Marshall mounted the largest survey of his work ever presented in Europe, filling over a thousand square meters with more than 70 artworks and insisting that Black presence belongs at the center of Western art history. His monumental paintings, such as “School of Beauty, School of Culture” (2012), assert visibility and permanence even as people vanish from American communities, some violently removed by ICE raids, others quietly deported without notice or warning, all without constitutional protection.Kerry James Marshall, \"School of Beauty, School of Culture\" (2012), acrylic on canvas (image courtesy the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York)Mickalene Thomas's exhibitions in Europe are equally canon-shifting. All About Love at Les Abbatoirs in Toulouse was her first major show in France, and she will break yet another barrier in December by opening the first-ever major exhibition by an African-American artist at the Grand Palais in Paris. Her striking rhinestone portraits of Black women — like “Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe: Les trois femmes noires” (2010) and “Afro Goddess Looking Forward” (2015) — radiate glamor, intellect, and authority on a scale historically rare in major French institutions. European audiences embraced Thomas's All About Love, while over 300,000 Black women in the United States were pushed out of the workforce this year and their unemployment rate climbed to 6.7% in August as federal and corporate layoffs systematically targeted positions many had long held, including in dismantled Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs.Abney's Heaven's Hotline in the Elbow Church confronts religious capitalism and American Christian ideals with her monumental sculptures, even as White Christian nationalism in the United States becomes more extreme and entrenched.Across Europe, these exhibitions offer Black American stories that subvert reductive narratives. These artists speak for themselves, asserting specificity, imagination, and a refusal to be flattened or erased. Yet, these contradictions expose something larger than a funding crisis or political cycle. They reveal a nation fractured into competing narratives and a fight over whose stories prevail.Barbara Earl Thomas with her linocut \"Jacob as a Young Artist\" (2025) in Jacob Lawrence: African American Modernistat London's Royal Academy (photo © Mike Bink; image courtesy Kunsthal KAdé)Black Americans seeking and receiving better recognition in Europe is not new. James Baldwin, Barbara Chase-Riboud, Richard Wright, and many others sought reprieve there while white supremacy raged on at home. But this moment transcends individual refuge. Major European institutions are making visible, well-funded commitments to Black American narratives as the United States is seeking to neutralize, and tame what is evidenced in their power and skill.Walking through the exhibitions this fall, I felt the rupture between the full, complex realities of Black American experiences that these artists confront — erasure, exclusion, brutality, but also joy, resistance, and refusal — and the containment efforts happening at home. And I found myself wondering what European audiences make of seeing both sides of this growing chasm at once.A precedent is being set right now about which American stories are carried forward. Who steps up to witness matters. Who remembers matters. And who looks away will be remembered, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNina Chanel Abney\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJacob Lawrence\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKerry James Marshall\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMickalene Thomas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n",

Bourgeois lived to the age of 98, still active and furiously making art until the end. And according to Bernadac’s thorough and vivid account, the French-American artist kept nearly everything she made, read, wore, or wrote in the course of a long life. This includes Bourgeois’s massive oeuvre of sculpture, installations, prints, paintings, and drawings, along with letters dating back to her childhood, school notebooks, business transactions (hers and her parents’), and writing from at least as far back as age 11, when she first began keeping a diary. Even the hardiest biographer might buckle under the weight of so much material. Yet Bernadac, a French curator who knew Bourgeois and organized exhibitions of her work during the artist’s lifetime, is ideal to take on the task. She makes no effort to conceal her sympathetic perspective on her subject, while recognizing Bourgeois as an artist who was emotionally volatile, depressive, competitive, driven, and visionary. While there is a certain headlong bravery in writing the biography of so biographical an artist, one raised in and around Paris but who spent most of her adult life in New York, Bernadac humbly suggests that her book is just the beginning. She likens it to “a gigantic tapestry,” and writes, “I’m leaving the tapestry unfinished, so that other, more profound studies may take shape.” Crisply translated by writer Lauren Elkin (whose excellent 2023 book Art Monsters: Unruly Bodies in Feminist Art includes Bourgeois among its subjects), Knife-Woman is, if not necessarily profound, then impressively woven. And though it’s organized as a straightforward chronological account of Bourgeois’s life, Bernadac does veer from standard biographical practice by referring to her subject as Louise, a choice I appreciate for a variety of feminist and other reasons. Her use of first names extends to all the primary figures in the artist’s life, from her mother, Joséphine, and father, Louie (after whom Louise was named — he’d wanted a boy), to her husband, the esteemed American art historian Robert Goldwater.Louise Bourgeois in her studio, New York, c. 1946 (image © courtesy The Easton Foundation/Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York)The author deploys her metaphor deliberately, as Bourgeois was surrounded by tapestries growing up in her parents’ repair business, where her mother was responsible for the majority of the hands-on work. “The tapestry restoration workshop is the backdrop of all Bourgeois’s memories,” Bernadac writes, “the maternal material that structured and enfolded her artistic apprenticeship.” Bourgeois was employed at a young age by her mother to create replacement drawings for feet worn away when tapestries were dragged along the ground. Such a detail — repeatedly drawing feet (or other body parts) — is no doubt essential to the artist's later work. As is a passage about Bourgeois’s mother, who cut out “cupids’ genitals and other explicit parts and replaced them with flowers or fruits, because the puritanical American collectors couldn’t bear to see sexual organs on tapestries. Joséphine kept these woven bits of genitals clumped together in a box.” It’s not hard to image just such a box as a Louise Bourgeois artwork.Bernadac’s text is augmented with reproductions of her work and photographs from every era of Bourgeois’s life, from family snapshots of a proper young woman turned out in Chanel, Paul Poiret, and Sonia Delaunay, to Robert Mapplethorpe’s iconic 1982 image of a grinning Bourgeois with her penis sculpture, “Fillette,” tucked insouciantly under one arm. Louise Bourgeois with \"Sleep II,\" Pietrasanta, Italy, 1967 (image © The Easton Foundation/Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/Photo: Studio Fotografico, I. Bessi, Carrara)While offering much incisive biographical information and important insights on Bourgeois’s work, Bernadac’s observations of the artist’s inner life can feel less perceptive. For example, “Louise, like a good hysteric, worried she was sterile – which is one of the things that led her to adopt a French orphan in 1939” (the oldest of her three sons, Michel, was adopted), or, “She had all the physical symptoms of hysteria: cramps, heaviness in the stomach, contractions in the diaphragm, diarrhea, insomnia.” While there’s no question that Bourgeois struggled with her mental state, spending years in therapy (and writing about it), Bernadac’s outdated and arguably sexist terminology, applied with such breezy certainty, is unconvincing.On the whole, though, Bernadac’s book is an impressive undertaking that more than confirms Bourgeois’s wish for her career. “My credo,” the artist said in a 1968 interview, “is that I hope I will live long enough to say most of the things I want to say. That’s it.” She did.Louise Bourgeois with \"La famille\" (in progress), New York, 2008 (image © The Easton Foundation/Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York/Photo © Alex Van Gelder)Knife-Woman: The Life of Louise Bourgeois by Marie-Laure Bernadac with a translation by Lauren Elkin (2025) is published by Yale University Press and is available online and in bookstores.\n                  \n                      \n                        Book Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Louise Bourgeois\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

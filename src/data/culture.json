Because they've long stopped being about just one depraved pedophile and have come to symbolize the endemic depravity of the world's richest elites.  It's no surprise that the art world is implicated. There isn't much difference between a corporation's board of directors and a museum's board of trustees. It's more or less the same money, same power dynamics, and the same creeps crawling through the corridors. But another world is possible. Please read Editor-at-Large Hrag Vartanian's opinion piece on how we got here in the first place, and what we need to do to encourage an arts ecosystem that doesn't sustain itself with filthy money. \"I don’t believe the hogwash that 'the system has always been this way,' since that invites the type of pessimism that is fertile ground for exploitation,\" he writes.

    "body": "\n\tJack Lang, the former French culture minister, stepped down as president of the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris after his name surfaced in newly released Jeffrey Epstein files, according to the Guardian.\n\n\tLang, who served two terms as culture minister under President François Mitterrand, resigned on Saturday amid mounting scrutiny. He had led the Institut du Monde Arabe since 2013.\n\n\tThe immediate catalyst was a tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice on January 30. In those files, Lang and his daughter, Caroline Lang, appear among hundreds of public figures whose names are connected in some way to Epstein’s vast web of contacts. Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tTheir inclusion in the files does not in itself suggest any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s crimes. Still, the fallout in France was swift. \n\n\tProsecutors announced that they had opened a preliminary investigation into Jack and Caroline Lang for alleged “aggravated tax fraud money laundering,” a move that increased political pressure. Lang was reportedly summoned to the French Foreign Ministry at the request of President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu. Rather than wait for that meeting, he chose to resign.\n\n\tIn a letter explaining his decision, Lang described the current atmosphere as toxic and said he was stepping aside to shield the institution from further harm. Speaking to Agence France-Presse, he called the accusations “baseless” and said he welcomed the investigation because it would confirm that he had done nothing wrong.\n\n\tThe attention has centered in part on Caroline Lang’s past business dealings. Files show that in 2016 she partnered with Epstein in a company called Pyrtanée LLC, which was described as focusing on acquiring works by emerging French artists. \n\n\tShe has said she was introduced to Epstein by Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn in 2012 and characterized her involvement as naïve. She told investigators that she did not invest in or receive funds from the US Virgin Islands–registered company and that its legal and financial structures were handled by Epstein’s lawyers.\n\n\tAs scrutiny intensified, she resigned from her role as managing director of France’s Independent Producer Syndicate and from the board of the TV festival Series Mania.\n\t\n\n\tJack Lang’s stature makes the episode especially striking. As culture minister in the 1980s and early 1990s, he was instrumental in expanding access to the arts and launched the annual Fête de la Musique, now celebrated worldwide. \n\n\tHis leadership at the Institute du Monde Arabe had become part of that legacy, positioning him as a bridge between France and the Arab world. His resignation closes a chapter that stretches back to the early Mitterrand years.\n\n\tLang confirmed to the French press that he had met Epstein years ago and said he was shocked when the financier’s crimes became public. He has framed the relationship as casual and insists he never received funds tied to Epstein’s activities.\n\n\tEpstein embedded himself in the cultural sphere and had myriad connections to the art world. He maintained a personal art collection, engaged with collectors such as Ronald Lauder and Leon Black, and corresponded with figures across museums, universities, and galleries. His network also extended to board members of institutions like the New York Academy of Art and to major donors linked to museums and research centers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tOne of the seven wonders of the ancient world, according to traditional lists, the Lighthouse of Alexandria once loomed over the Mediterranean city’s harbor during Egypt’s Hellenistic age. At 460 feet tall, it was second only to the Great Pyramid of Gaza in height.\n\n\tThe lighthouse, also known as the Pharos of Alexandria, was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter (c. 367–283 B.C.), a Macedonian Greek general under Alexander the Great who became pharaoh of Egypt; it was seen to completion by his son and successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus. During the Ptolomaic dynasty, which lasted 300 years, Alexandria was a center of Greek culture in Egypt.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tLocated on the island of Pharos off the coast of Alexandria, the lighthouse was constructed of stone and was rectangular at the bottom, octagonal in the middle, and cylindrical at the top. It used mirrors and a furnace to guide ships to the city’s harbor.\n\n\tThe building, already weakened by previous tremblors, was destroyed by the 1303 Crete earthquake, most of its remains disappearing under rising seas. Now, however, as reported in the New York Times, a group of historians, architects, and programmers are working to create a digital 3-D model of the ancient structure.\n\n\t“The architectural fragments lie scattered over 18 acres underwater,” Isabelle Hairy, an archaeologist at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and the Center for Alexandrian Studies in Egypt and leader of the Pharos Project team, told the Times.\n\n\tLast summer, the Pharos Project team used a crane to bring granite blocks and other relics to the surface so they could be scanned and digitally positioned in the 3-D model. One major discovery was a pylon combining Greek building skills with Egyptian stylistic elements.\n\n\tSo far, the project has made seabed scans of some 5000 building elements and artifacts on the sea floor; worsening water conditions, however, make it likely that further scans will rely on raising submerged material from the water before returning it to the sea for preservation. “The visibility is extremely bad,” Hairy told the Times, “the seabed is uneven and there are no clear layers of sediment.” Because of this, she estimates it will take generations to complete the project.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn mid-December, on a tour of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, Abby Jones, the acting chief of protocol at the State Department, floated the idea that the Smithsonian should create a dedicated gallery featuring multiple images of President Donald Trump, according to the New York Times. This, of course, would be in addition to his official portrait.\n\n\tLater, administration officials noted that the White House regularly receives artworks depicting the President from supporters and suggested that some of it could be displayed at the museum.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“President Trump receives an unprecedented amount of beautiful artwork from patriotic Americans all across our great country,” a statement released by the White House said, “and it is important to the People’s President that their creations are showcased throughout the halls of our Nation’s Capital.”\n\n\tThere is no formal proposal on the table, the Times reported, and it remains unclear how seriously the idea is being considered, since the Smithsonian has not received an official request.\n\n\tThe National Portrait Gallery regularly includes more than one image of past Presidents in its permanent installation. But the museum’s standard practice has been to debut its commissioned portraits only after a President has completed his time in office.\n\n\tThe discussion follows a recent change at the museum. Last month, the gallery replaced Trump’s original official photograph with a different image he found more flattering. At the same time, it removed wall text referencing his two impeachments. The museum said the changes were part of a “broader update” to the exhibition and that the history of impeachments continues to be addressed elsewhere in its galleries.\n\n\tTensions between the White House and the Smithsonian have nearly boiled over since the start of Trump’s second term. The president has criticized what he described as ideological bias in museum displays and has pressed the institution for detailed information about its content and finances. Smithsonian officials, meanwhile, say that the institution operates independently of the executive branch.\n\n\tIn the meantime, visitors to the National Portrait Gallery can already see Trump’s current official image: a black-and-white photograph by White House photograph Daniel Torok showing the president scowling over the Resolute Desk. Whether that single portrait eventually gains company remains an open question, but despite professing its autonomy, the museum leadership have in the past buckled under White House pressure. Last year, the President said he had fired Kim Sajet, then the museum’s director, for a variety of reasons, including the wall texts that mentioned Trump’s impeachment. Sajet continued reporting to work before resigning.\n",

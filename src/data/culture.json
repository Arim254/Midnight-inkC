    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tNovember 28th, 2025  9 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs hard as it may be to believe, some of us have nev­er seen a movie belong­ing to the Mar­vel Cin­e­mat­ic Uni­verse. If you’re one of those unini­ti­at­ed, none of the count­less clips incor­po­rat­ed into the Like Sto­ries of Old video essay above will tempt you to get ini­ti­at­ed. Nor will the laments aired by host Tom van der Lin­den, who, despite once enjoy­ing the MCU him­self, even­tu­al­ly came to won­der why keep­ing up with its releas­es had begun to feel less like a thrill than a chore. As if their CGI-laden sound and fury weren’t try­ing enough, there’s also “the con­stant quip­ping, the annoy­ing self-aware­ness, the fact that every­thing has to be a fran­chise now.”\nVan der Lin­den labels a cen­tral fac­tor in the decline of the MCU “sto­ry­telling entropy.” Clas­sic films, you may have noticed, con­cen­trate prac­ti­cal­ly all the ener­gy in every facet of their pro­duc­tion toward the expres­sion of spe­cif­ic themes, sto­ries, and char­ac­ters; at their best, their every line, ges­ture, cut, and inven­tion rep­re­sents the tip of an artis­tic ice­berg. Take, to use a pop­u­lar exam­ple, the lightsaber intro­duced in Star Wars, which Van der Lin­den calls “not just a weapon, but a metaphor” that “sym­bol­i­cal­ly com­mu­ni­cates a lot about the phi­los­o­phy of its wield­er, and about the larg­er world that it exists in,” con­dens­ing “a mul­ti­tude of mean­ings and ideas into a sim­ple, sin­gu­lar object.”\nIt does so in the first two or three movies, at any rate. In the decades since, as the Star Wars uni­verse has grown ever vaster, more com­plex, and con­cep­tu­al­ly unwieldy, so the pro­lif­er­a­tion and mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the once-mar­velous lightsaber has turned it into some­thing mun­dane, even banal. So it goes with sto­ry­telling entropy, a phe­nom­e­non that afflicts every nar­ra­tive fran­chise com­mer­cial­ly com­pelled to grow with­out end. That process of expan­sion even­tu­al­ly turns even the most cap­ti­vat­ing orig­i­nal mate­ri­als dif­fuse and unin­volv­ing to all but the hard­est-core fans — by which point it has usu­al­ly become obvi­ous that cre­ators them­selves have long since lost their own pas­sion for the sto­ries.\nMost MCU view­ers will admit that it has pro­duced miss­es as well as hits. But Mar­veliza­tion, as Van der Lin­den calls it, has also inspired oth­er, imi­ta­tive cor­po­rate fran­chis­es to pump out glob­al­ly mar­ketable con­tent fierce­ly pro­tect­ed by intel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty lawyers — and has even drained the inter­est out of realms of film and tele­vi­sion that have noth­ing to do with super­heroes, swords, or sci-fi. Hol­ly­wood has always been about the bot­tom line, of course, but only in recent decades have mar­ket sat­u­ra­tion, cross-plat­form strat­e­gy, and max­i­mum crossover poten­tial come to dom­i­nate its pri­or­i­ties so com­plete­ly. From the MCU or oth­er­wise, a Mar­velized movie is one that, at bot­tom, has no press­ing need to be made — and that we, ulti­mate­ly, feel no press­ing need to see.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Real Any­more: A Close Look at Chang­ing Film­mak­ing Tech­niques\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tNovember 27th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAlice’s Restau­rant. It’s now a Thanks­giv­ing clas­sic, and some­thing of a tra­di­tion around here. Record­ed in 1967, the 18+ minute coun­ter­cul­ture song recounts Arlo Guthrie’s real encounter with the law, start­ing on Thanks­giv­ing Day 1965. As the long song unfolds, we hear all about how a hip­pie-bat­ing police offi­cer, by the name of William “Obie” Oban­hein, arrest­ed Arlo for lit­ter­ing. (Cul­tur­al foot­note: Obie pre­vi­ous­ly posed for sev­er­al Nor­man Rock­well paint­ings, includ­ing the well-known paint­ing, “The Run­away,” that graced a 1958 cov­er of The Sat­ur­day Evening Post.) In fair­ly short order, Arlo pleads guilty to a mis­de­meanor charge, pays a $25 fine, and cleans up the thrash. But the sto­ry isn’t over. Not by a long shot.\nLat­er, when Arlo (son of Woody Guthrie) gets called up for the draft, the pet­ty crime iron­i­cal­ly becomes a basis for dis­qual­i­fy­ing him from mil­i­tary ser­vice in the Viet­nam War. Guthrie recounts this with some bit­ter­ness as the song builds into a satir­i­cal protest against the war: “I’m sit­tin’ here on the Group W bench ’cause you want to know if I’m moral enough to join the Army, burn women, kids, hous­es and vil­lages after bein’ a lit­ter­bug.” And then we’re back to the cheery cho­rus again: “You can get any­thing you want, at Alice’s Restau­rant.”\nWe have fea­tured Guthrie’s clas­sic dur­ing past years.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThrough large-scale tapestries of fringed strips of fabric, Abdoulaye Konaté explores the contemporary relevance of ancient signs and symbols. The Malian artist began working with textiles in the 1990s, when it became clear to him how prevalent they are in our everyday lives, from clothing and home goods to tools and more. This early interest began what’s become a research-driven artistic practice, and today, he layers long, stitched pieces of Bazin and Kente fabrics into dynamic, largely abstract works.\nKonaté and his team create each monumental tapestry entirely by hand, from the dyeing process to cutting and stitching. The final layout typically occurs on the studio floor after the artist sketches in marker and digitally refines this preliminary drawing to determine the exact composition.\n“Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo” (2024), textile, 264.5 × 524 centimeters\nMost works incorporate gradients that begin with lighter colors on the bottom before reaching deep navys, reds, and blacks up top. Patterns and various motifs often emerge from the gathered strips as a way to invoke the artist’s broad research interests from “Malian craftsmanship, Tibetan art, Tunisian ceramics, Berber textiles, etc,” says a statement from Templon.\n“Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo,” for example, features a geometric mark derived from the Manding people of West Africa. “I took this symbol and deconstructed it, breaking it down into a central element, and then I tried to rework it from both sides,” the artist shares in a video interview. This enormous piece—which stretches upwards of 17 feet long—also features small Kalao birds, which, for the Bambara tribe, represent wisdom and protection. They’re also thought to facilitate communication between our realm and the spiritual.\nDespite his commitment to textiles, the artist likens his work to painting and the ways it allows for self-expression. “The material changes, but I think of it as painting,” he adds.\nIf you’re in Paris, you can see Konaté’s most recent exhibition, Le tissu du réel, or The fabric of reality, on view at Templon through December 31.\n“Composition bleue avec losanges – motif Tibet” (2023), textile (Bazin and Kente), 242 × 224 centimeters\nDetail of “Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo” (2024), textile, 264.5 × 524 centimeters\nDetail of “Losange et triangle (bazin et kente) – ocre” (2024), textile, 266 × 397 centimeters\n“Bleu et vert aux carrés” (2024), textile, 211 × 150 centimeters\n“Vert Touareg (motif 2)” (2023), textile, 194 × 157 centimeters\nInstallation view of Photo by Tanguy Beurdeley\nInstallation view\n\t\n\t\n\t",

This week, artists paint to the sounds of washing machines and commune with ancestors while they work.Want to take part? Check out our submission guidelines and share a bit about your studio with us through this form! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.Mieke Marple, Los Angeles, CaliforniaHow long have you been working in this space?My garage? Since right before my daughter was born, so almost three years.Describe an average day in your studio.It looks like me doing laundry while masking off a painting or running the dishwasher while airbrushing some final painting details. My art-making windows are small because I also work three part-time jobs and watch my daughter. So it’s an hour here, 45 minutes there, maybe another 30 minutes at night. But the time adds up, since I try to write or make art every day. I listen to electronic music, or NPR, or sometimes audiobooks (most recently Elizabeth Gilbert’s All the Way to the River), almost always coupled with the loud thrum of the washing machine and dryer.How does the space affect your work?I feel so safe and unselfconscious here in my garage studio that it’s allowed me to take risks in my art practice without fear. Previously, my studio was in a big building with over 60 artists and I felt self-conscious there for no good reason … It wasn’t like I left my door open, but simply being near other artists made me jumpy because I am a sensitive and neurotic bird.How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?I am very connected to the Silverlake neighborhood where I live and work. I can be found at the local playground four or five days a week. I don’t drink, but it’s the equivalent of a Cheers bar where everyone knows my name. I’ve met and befriended a lot of talented creatives, such as artist Alex Olson and filmmaker Aemelia Scott, just by hanging out at the playground for hours with my daughter.What do you love about your studio?That I can pop out and see my family for five seconds at any given time before going back to work.What do you wish were different?I wish it were bigger, had natural light, and that I wasn’t always doing laundry. For the first two years of my garage studio, I didn’t have anyone over because I was embarrassed about the washer and dryer and all the storage racks next to my art. Then, I got over that and started to love inviting people over. Still, I wish it didn’t double as my family’s storage space. My husband is always tossing empty Amazon boxes into the garage as if the garage weren’t my TEMPLE OF CREATIVITY … My dream situation would be to buy another house or storefront nearby, a five-minute walk away, and have that as my studio. Is that too lofty? I hope not.What is your favorite local museum?LACMA, not exactly an underdog museum, but that’s okay.What is your favorite art material to work with?Fluorescent paint. I love it!Akudzwe Elsie Chiwa, Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaHow long have you been working in this space?I have been working in this space for over a year. It is my home studio. I carved out a portion of our lounge to turn into my studio.Describe an average day in your studio.My work schedule is eclectic. I work a 9-to-5 job and I try to dedicate an hour after work, and the weekends when I am free. I normally work from the couch, and sometimes I take my work up to the room and watch a show or movie I have watched before as the background sound. When I am really in the zone, I like to listen to music, and sometimes I work in silence so I can hear the work speaking to me better. I generally work on several projects at the same time, so as to encourage fluidity amongst or between the works.How does the space affect your work?A lot of my work delves into the intersectionality of the home-space when it comes to femininity and Afro-feminism and the stories of womanhood and girlhood. The home-space is a site of memory and excavation. To be able to create the work at home builds into the themes, the storytelling, the materiality, and the intimacy it takes to tell and create stories through art.How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?I haven't been able to interact with the external environment as much as I want to. When I get into the process of making the work, I enter into a bubble of isolation, where I commune with my feminine ancestors. This is to ensure that the work stays true to their stories and desires as well as their purpose. I connect to the greater Pittsburgh Black community, as these stories are about the lost and forgotten histories of southern Africa, and by extension, Black identities before, during, and after the colonial and Civil Rights era. As a Zimbabwean-American who comes from a culture of humanism and connection, it is important that my work connects to the people who exist within its sphere of inception.What do you love about your studio?I love that it's home, that I can wake up in the middle of the night and make art.

    "body": "\n    \n                Book Review\n                Art historian Cat Dawson’s new book invites us to contemplate a world populated by subversive monuments — or one that does away with them altogether.\n                \n        \n            Kara Walker, \"A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby, an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant\" (2014), polystyrene foam and sugar (artwork © Kara Walker, courtesy Sikkema Jenkins & Co. and Sprüth Magers; photo Jason Wyche)\n    \n        \n            While Robert Musil’s century-old adage that “there is nothing in this world as invisible as a monument” still rings true in some ways, many monuments today feel more visible than ever. Statues of Cecil Rhodes and Robert E. Lee have collapsed under the pressures of public protest, exposing monuments for what they really are: flashpoints where histories are negotiated and mythologies are formed. In Monumental: How a New Generation of Artists Is Shaping the Memorial Landscape (2025), art historian Cat Dawson identifies the roots of contemporary artists’ confrontation of monumentality by locating its watershed moment. Kara Walker’s “A Subtlety” (2014), a 75-foot (~22.9-meter) sugar sculpture, temporarily occupied one of the now-demolished buildings at the Domino Sugar Refinery in Brooklyn and radically subverted the genre. Walker drew upon conventions of monumentality and subverted them to foreground histories of gendered and racialized violence, consumption, and extraction that bind the past to the present. The AIDS Memorial Quilt unfolded on the National Mall in Washington, DC, on July 4, 2012, as part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. (photo Elvert Barnes, image CC BY-SA 2.0 via Flickr)Dawson compellingly dubs this artistic turn a “monument boom” — an era characterized by contemporary artists troubling the genre of monuments from 2014 through at least 2023. This new generation of monuments pushes beyond the premise of uplifting silenced narratives, Dawson argues, by unraveling the very processes by which historical exclusions become naturalized in the public realm.The core chapters focus on the varied approaches taken by Walker’s “Fons Americanus” (2019), Kehinde Wiley’s “Rumors of War” (2019), Mark Bradford’s Tomorrow Is Another Day at the 2017 Venice Biennale, and Lauren Halsey’s the eastside of south central los angeles hieroglyph prototype architecture (I) (2022), the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Roof Garden Commission of 2023. Dawson argues that these artworks employ Black and queer representational strategies in their acts of monumental undoing, primarily concerning legacies of Atlantic slavery and their manifestations in the United States. This tight selection of examples illuminates the ordinary terror embodied by the “traditional” monument — typified by Confederate monuments from the late 19th and early 20th centuries — and how these artists subvert it, whether through wit, narrative mélange, or honoring everyday figures. Rather than construct an imagined past as a universal tradition, as with conventional monuments, Dawson writes that these contemporary artists understand ambivalence and impermanence as key conditions of resistance, whether in the form of ephemeral materials, representations that flit across binaries, or speculative propositions for the future that challenge linear readings of history. Halsey’s the eastside of south central, for example, reimagines the Temple of Dendur as a site where ancient African pasts collapse into an Afrofuturist horizon, where hieroglyphics commingle with references to funk music, graffiti art, protest signs, and Los Angeles streetscapes. Lauren Halsey's the eastside of south central los angeles hieroglyph prototype architecture (I) on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in April 2023 (photo Elaine Velie/Hyperallergic)This “ambivalence” is perhaps the keenest element of Dawson’s analysis. It taps into the fallibility of tidy historical narratives, while opening the window of uncertainty and anxiety that shapes all monuments.Dawson recognizes “that all monuments are subject to constraints that delimit even the most nuanced and complex examples of the form.” Still, I found myself craving a greater critical acknowledgment of the institutional conditions from which these new monuments emerge. The public power of these artworks is necessarily mediated by cultural institutions, which are themselves replete with legacies of extraction and exclusion running parallel to the tenor of monumentalism. Museums like The Met and the Tate, for instance, have latched onto the creative possibilities and popular interest afforded by the temporary, large-scale commission, which most of Dawson’s examples fall under. Yet artists must still play by the rules, abiding by the conditions of sponsorship to create an institutionally sanctioned expression of monumentalism. Despite Walker’s demonstrated interest in institutional contexts, her sculpture “Fons Americanus” at the Tate referred directly to a monument sited outside of the gallery, rather than the connections between its namesake, sugar refinery magnate Henry Tate, and the slave economy. Walker herself recalled that a former Tate director seemed unamused by her suggestion that “A Subtlety\" would be thematically well-suited for the Turbine Hall. Kara Walker, \"Fons Americanus\" (2019), non-toxic acrylic and cement composite, recyclable cork, wood, and metal, at the Tate Modern (artwork © Kara Walker, courtesy Sikkema Jenkins & Co. and Sprüth Magers; photo Matt Greenwood/Tate)What stakes are at play if the most common staging grounds for these new monuments are the rarified atriums and rooftops of art museums? While Dawson discusses the sponsorship and public presence of Confederate monuments in detail, this question of context is under-addressed in their study of new monuments — a narrative thread that would have helped generate a more complex picture of the networks of power that mediate the monumental landscape.That said, the salience of Dawson’s argument to the rise of fascism today and the future of monuments is undeniable. In freeing the form from the strictures of convention, these artworks contemplate a world populated by more diverse monumental narratives — or one that does away with monuments altogether. The ongoing negotiation of these paths forward plays out before us in real time. MONUMENTS at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, takes decommissioned Confederate memorials as the raw matter for artistic intervention, including works by Walker, who co-curated the show. The Trump administration’s call for a “National Garden of American Heroes” threatens to mobilize the aggrandizing rhetoric of monument-making in full force, ultimately in service of the president’s own self-monumentalization, while it seeks to reinstall many of the Confederate statues that were removed during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.As we scramble through this terrain of toppled, relocated, mutated monuments or ruminate on those never built, Dawson’s book is a timely reminder to question the fundamental utility of monuments — who are they for, and what work do they actually do? Statue of Napoleon I after the Fall of the Vendôme Column in Paris in 1870 (photo Bruno Braquehais, image public domain via the MIT Press)Monumental: How a New Generation of Artists Is Shaping the Memorial Landscape (2025) by Cat Dawson is published by the MIT Press and is available online and through independent booksellers.\n                  \n                      \n                        Book Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Monuments\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Remaining Native (2025) follows Paiute teenager Kutoven \"Ku\" Stevens, whose goal to run professionally proves to be inseparable from the story of his great-grandfather, who ran away from a residential school for Indigenous children.Four years in the making, Mohawk/Oneida director and producer Paige Bethmann’s film made its award-winning premiere at South by Southwest Film and TV Festival last March before embarking on its international festival circuit. The documentary's team organized a week of screenings from Friday, November 21, through Thursday, November 27, at DCTV’s Firehouse Cinema in Tribeca as part of the nationwide Fall of Freedom programming. Remaining Native is set on the Yerington Paiute Reservation in rural western Nevada, the ancestral lands where Stevens and his parents live. At 17 years old, Stevens wants only one thing: to shave seconds off his run time so he can get recruited to the University of Oregon's renowned track and field team. Stevens, while naturally talented, is coached only by his father and ultimately left to his own devices to stand out at races.“He was just really set on being the best runner ever,” Bethmann explained in a call with Hyperallergic. “But with that level of commitment comes sacrifice, right?” she continued, referring to Stevens’s tunnel-vision goal that came before everything else — including his identity.Every day, Stevens runs independently on the gravel paths in the desert land where he and his ancestors have resided for generations. His training schedule leaves him with little time to fully engage with his culture and community. But when he runs, he reaches a meditative state that allows him to reach through history and connect with his late paternal great-grandfather, Frank Quinn.Kutoven Stevens at one of his races in NevadaLike hundreds of thousands of Indigenous children across the colonized North American territories, Quinn had been abducted and forcibly taken to a government-funded residential training school run by Christian missionaries. From the early 19th to mid-20th centuries, the United States had over 400 boarding schools across 37 states; Quinn ended up at Stewart Indian School in Carson City, Nevada. Formed under the assimilationist mandate to “kill the Indian, save the man,” these state-sponsored residential schools forcibly immersed abducted Native children in the cultural and religious norms of a Christian, Anglo-American population. Missionaries cut off the children’s traditionally long hair, replaced their given names with Biblical or Western ones, and inflicted vicious corporal punishment if they didn't speak in English. Family separation, forced labor, physical and sexual abuse, uninhabitable conditions, and rampant disease broke the spirits of thousands of Indigenous children — many died or took their own lives, and were buried in unmarked graves at the schools. Others, like Quinn, were able to run away.Kutoven's great-grandfather, Yerington Paiute tribal elder Frank Quinn, and great-grandmother, HazelIt took Quinn three tries to escape Stewart Indian School. At eight years old, he managed to run 50 miles (~80.5 kilometers) from Carson City back to his family on Paiute land in Yerington, where he spent the rest of his life and later became a respected tribal elder. In Remaining Native, Bethmann incorporates archival photographs of uniformed children at the Stewart Indian School around 1910, when Quinn would have been a student, and juxtaposes them with footage of Stevens as a young boy engaging with Paiute traditions.A map of the 50-mile journey Frank Quinn ran as an eight year old, plotted by the Stevens family for the Remembrance Run“Imagine you’re eight,” Stevens’s voice repeats throughout the film as he recalls his great-grandfather’s monumental journey, acknowledging that without Quinn’s bravery and sacrifice, he wouldn’t be training for college recruitment. Stevens grapples with the weight of this legacy, even noting that his first name, which means “the eagle bringing the light from the darkness,” comes with responsibility. In 2021, when investigators discovered hundreds of children buried at an unmarked cemetery at a Canadian residential school, further investigations throughout North America found that the Indigenous boarding school system carried a collective death toll well into the thousands.These discoveries were profoundly traumatizing for Indigenous communities in both Canada and the United States. The Stevens family coped with the news by creating the Remembrance Run. They planned to cover the same 50 miles Quinn ran from Carson City to Yerington in a two-day run in order to channel his strength, carry his pain, and start healing through acknowledging generational trauma. Stevens has staged the annual group run three times now; Bethmann, whose own family has been similarly impacted by residential schools, filmed the run from Yerington back to the Stewart Indian School for inclusion in Remaining Native.Kutoven and other Remembrance Run participants trek through the water during the first 25 miles of the Remembrance Run.“The first run we did from the school to the reservation was for raising awareness, but this one in the film was about getting answers,” Stevens, now age 21, explained in a phone call to Hyperallergic. “It was about  bringing this unhealed wound to the government. So we invited then-Governor Sisolak and the Nevada Senators, showed them that there's a grave site at this school, and asked them, ‘What are you guys doing about this?’”For Stevens, remediation through the state “looks like education.”“It looks like enforcing the history of my people being taught at a public education level because it's not accurately represented when you think of the Native American in a typical history book,” he reiterated. Bethmann explained that she kept the government officials’ voices out of the film because “they felt empty.” She switched out their pre-written speeches with footage of the Remembrance Run's Native participants unpacking the ways in which residential schools have impacted their families. Kutoven's running shoesBethmann credits the cohort of Indigenous filmmakers at the 4th World Media Lab for their guidance and grounding, which ultimately influenced the film's narrative structure. “They helped me honor my original intention in the way I wanted to tell Ku’s story,” Bethmann said. “It doesn't need to be linear, it doesn't need to be investigative or follow a three-act structure, it can be more aligned with our ways of storytelling.” Remaining Native will screen three times on Thanksgiving Day at DCTV’s Firehouse Cinema.\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Film\n                      \n                      \n                        Documentary\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

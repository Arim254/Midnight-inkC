    "body": "\n\n\t\nYou’ve probably heard the idiom, “the elephant in the room,” to describe when there’s some uncomfortable and obvious problem that no one is addressing—the kind of issue that feels as though it’s taking up all available space. But what if yet another megafauna came stampeding onto the scene? That’s where Berlin-based artist Itamar Gov’s large-scale installation comes in.\nThe Rhinoceros in the Room is a towering, inflatable sculpture that fills a medieval church nave at Kunstmuseum Magdeburg in Germany. Gov draws inspiration from Renaissance engraver Albrecht Dürer’s iconic rhinoceros woodcut, which the artist created in 1515 without having ever seen one of the animals himself. His rendering is wildly inaccurate in terms of anatomy, depicting an extra horn at the creature’s shoulders and armor instead of a thick leather hide, but thanks to the ability to replicate it in print, it captured the public’s imagination.\n\nDürer’s image persists as a symbol of imperial might and prestige. The animal itself represents power and vigor, and one was even gifted from Sultan Muzafar II of Gujaratm, India, to King Manuel I of Portugal in 1515, providing the inspiration for the artist’s rendering.\nThe rhinoceros has also been hunted and poached nearly to extinction, and several species remain critically endangered today. For The Rhinoceros in the Room, Gov “combines historical events, philosophical ideas, and local legends and questions the fragile boundaries between fact and fiction; memory and imagination,” the museum says.\nPortrayed in monochrome gray, the gentle giant lumbers amid the 11th-century Romanesque colonnades, assuming a spectral guise. On one hand, it’s somewhat absurd in its sheer size and sense of being out-of-place, yet on the other, the creature invokes curiosity and wonder and stands sentry as an icon of brawn and resilience.\nThe Rhinoceros in the Room remains on view through July 5.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor residents of the Upper Midwest and Canada—the land of lakes—ice shanties are ubiquitous winter fixtures. From the huge temporary villages that emerge on Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago for sturgeon-spearing season to ramshackle, hand-built huts dotting Ontario’s Lake Simcoe, these vernacular structures are designed around openings or hatches in the floors so that hardy northerners can fish through holes drilled in the ice. It’s this unique tradition, combined with artistic flair, that serves as the inspiration for Art Shanty Projects.\nEvery winter, the Minneapolis-based program initiates an interactive series of projects on the lima bean-shaped Lake Harriet, located a few miles southwest of downtown. Dozens of artists construct one-of-a-kind huts that the public is invited to explore and interact with over the course of four weekends.\n\nFor the 2026 season, Art Shanty Projects commissioned local artists Emily Quandahl and Madeline Cochran for a bright, inviting, collaborative shelter. Quandahl’s practice predominantly centers around painting, and Cochran takes a multimedia approach to two-dimensional work, often incorporating textiles and weaving techniques.\nFor their “Quilt Shanty,” the duo conceived of a vibrant, blanket-like patchwork design that transports the feeling of comfort out into the lake’s stark openness. “We wanted to take a literal approach to the ‘barn quilt‘ by stretching a tactile textile over an agricultural form—specifically a hoop house,” Quandahl tells Colossal.\nA hoop house is a structure often used in gardens and agricultural settings that comprises a tunnel covered in PVC sheeting, which protects plants and can extend the growing season by a few weeks. Both artists grew up in the Driftless Region of Wisconsin and Minnesota, indelibly influenced by the region’s rural lifeways revolving around farming and deep-seated community.\n\n“Quilt Shanty” blends Cochran’s interest in folk illustrations through muslin compositions and interactive wooden quilt-square puzzle pieces. Quandahl constructed the hoop house frame and the 9-by-16-foot quilt made of studio scraps, vinyl, and drop cloths that encompasses it. To go along with Cochran’s wooden pieces, Quandahl also designed a trifold screen that serves as a key to the puzzle.\n“During our month on the ice, we found that nearly everyone who stepped into the shanty had a story to tell, whether it was about a quilt they inherited, a family member who taught them to sew, or a specific pattern that reminded them of home,” Quandahl says. “This collaboration really harkened back to the idea of a quilting bee. Historically, these weren’t just about sewing; they were social anchors for a community through communal labor.”\nExplore more of both Quandahl and Cochran’s work on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo by ZUNIS, courtesy Gabrielle Goliath studio)\n    \n        \n            South Africa has withdrawn its participation from the 2026 Venice Biennale following a months-long dispute over an artwork addressing Palestinian grief in Gaza.The move comes after the country's right-wing culture minister Gayton McKenzie scrapped a pavilion proposal by artist Gabrielle Goliath and curator Ingrid Masondo. An independent committee had selected the artist and curator in December to represent the country at the international art event. The two had proposed including a performance centering Gaza. Goliath and Masondo had planned to memorialize the lives of Gazans killed by the Israeli military, including the poet Hiba Abu Nada, as part of the ongoing performance series Elegy. The duo also planned to reference femicide in South Africa and the German-perpetuated Herero and Nama genocide in Namibia during the early 20th century.But in January, McKenzie halted Goliath and Masondo’s participation, arguing that the national pavilion “should not be used to amplify similarly divisive global disputes that do not center South Africa’s own story.” Goliath and Masondo’s dismissal was immediately met with opposition and accusations of censorship. “It is nothing short of shameful for the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture to have announced that South Africa will not be presenting a national pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year,” Goliath and Mosado said in a statement shared with Hyperallergic. “The space will remain empty: a space of erasure, cancellation, censure.”McKenzie's office has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s requests for comment on the withdrawal.Shortly after McKenzie pulled Goliath and Mosado’s pavilion in January, the duo sued the cultural minister in a South African court for making “unlawful attempt” to “censor and silence” their work. Earlier this week, however, a judge dismissed their case in a two-sentence ruling, according to a statement shared with Hyperallergic by a spokesperson for the duo. The judge also ordered Goliath and Mosado to pay the government’s lawyers' fees.Goliath and Mosado told Hyperallergic that they intended to appeal the decision, arguing that the ruling “jeopardise[s] the rights of artists, curators and creatives in South Africa to freedom of expression.”McKenzie’s actions to dismantle the Gaza-inclusive pavilion appear to represent an uncommon position within the South African government. Three decades after the official end of Apartheid, the South African government brought Israel in front of the International Court of Justice in 2024 for perpetuating the crime of genocide in Gaza in an ongoing landmark human rights case.The final deadline for countries to submit their pavilion proposals was January 19, days before Goliath and Mosado filed their lawsuit.“Elegy sounds a call to mourn, to refuse conditions of disregard and to assert black, brown, indigenous, femme, queer, and trans lives as lovable and grievable,” Goliath and Mosado wrote in their statement. “That call will not be silenced.”\n        ",

It is why I went to her latest exhibition, Goddess of All, at Jane Lombard.Carwath, whose work was the subject of an in-depth examination, Painting Is No Ordinary Object, organized by Karen Tsujimoto at the Oakland Museum of California in 2009, has long flown under the radar in New York City. Neither the Whitney Museum of American Art nor the Museum of Modern Art has anything in their collection by Carnwath, now in her late 70s.I cannot help but wonder if this neglect is because of her belief in the legacy of oil painting dating back to the Renaissance, as well as the fact that she has never been associated with Bay Area figurative painting or the Funk movement, despite living, teaching, and exhibiting there for many years. Artists who follow their own paths are generally not held in high regard unless it fits a curator’s agenda regarding politics, hot-button topics, or the “right” kind of abstraction — which are reasons why Joanne Greenbaum, a New York-based painter who is Carnwath’s temperamental opposite, is missing from those museum collections, too. Their fierce independence has not gained them the recognition it should have long ago.Squeak Carnwath, \"Past, Present, Future\" (2025), oil and alkyd on canvas over panelThere are 11 paintings in the exhibition, all of them square and ranging from 36 by 36 inches to 77 by 77 inches. Done in oil and alkyd on canvas mounted on panel with the titles written on the sides, they are made completely in oil paint, even when the lines and words appear to be drawn in pencil.Carnwath’s continually expanding vocabulary consists of meaningful motifs that reappear in her work — an LP record with a red label, a sinking ship, a 45 automatic with a red “X” through it, the outlines of the Venus de Milo and other classical busts and statuary, a tree stump, bands of color and abstract patterns — along with different phrases, such as “guilt free zone.” The LP record signifies that we go around once in life, while the sinking ship conveys inescapable disaster.Goddess of All includes her recent addition of a motif consisting of three black silhouettes: Edgar Degas’s “The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer” (c. 1881), the Statue of Liberty, and what looks like a crowned figure sitting in a high-backed chair or throne. Each silhouette signifies an idealized view of a woman, from aspiring dancer to powerful ruler.Squeak Carnwath, \"Our Own\" (2022), oil and alkyd on canvas over panel“Ancestors and Future Ghosts” (2023) is divided vertically into two unequal areas (one-third on the left and two-thirds on the right) by a band consisting of different-colored rectangles stacked on top of each other. On the left side, on a ground the color of poached salmon, we see the three silhouettes, writing, the black outline of an unidentified female figure overlaid by large, many-petaled flowers. From the petals to the writing, everything underscores the painting’s flat surface as a repository for graffiti, images, image fragments, and overheard snippets of the langue de tribe. Carnwath’s paintings comment on the present even as they speak to ancestors and speculate about future ghosts.“Ancient Fragments” (2025) is populated by red outlines of Roman busts, goddesses, insects, flowers, and the motif of two genderless faces passionately kissing. Two disembodied eyes look down at the word “insight.” Squeak Carnwath, \"Ancient Fragments\" (2025), oil and alkyd on canvas over panelWhat are we to make of this or the other paintings in the exhibition? I don’t see Carnwath as being didactic when she writes “Our bodies are our own” above the scribbled-over phrase “a sovereign territory” on the lower right side of “Our Own” (2022). Opposite this statement, on the left side of the painting, we read, “We are the sovereign rulers of our own bodies.” Carnwath has recognized that the world she grew up in has changed and there is no going back. The sinking ship in the upper half of the painting, against a pale gray ground, is situated above the black outline of two faces kissing against an off-white ground, above the crude lineation of crimson lips. Carnwath operates under the deep paradox of her commitment to paint and painting, even as she lives in a world that is spiraling out of control, and wrests out of it precarious instances of order.Goddess of All continues at Jane Lombard Gallery (58 White Street, Tribeca, Manhattan) through February 28. The exhibition was organized by the gallery.\n                  \n                      \n                        Art Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Squeak Carnwath\n                      \n                      \n                        Jane Lombard Gallery\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

(screenshot via Instagram)Punch was born at the zoo last summer and promptly abandoned by his mother, resulting in the zookeepers hand-rearing him. They provided him with towels and stuffed animals to cling onto for comfort and to promote muscle growth, as baby monkeys would normally do with their mothers, and Punch was especially fond of the orangutan toy. In an interview, the zookeepers said that the toy was essentially Punch's “surrogate mother.”Some of the viral photos of Punch and his toy orangutan (screenshot via X)When they facilitated his integration into the troop of macaques residing in the monkey enclosure in January, Punch brought the stuffed orangutan with him and held it for comfort as he started slowly interacting with the others. The zoo and its visitors shared regular updates of Punch moving around with the toy and laying on it — an equally precious and devastating sight.

The photos and videos have triggered everyone's maternal instincts online as increasingly fervent messages encouraging the shy monkey pour in on Instagram and X. Videos of the other monkeys bothering and pushing Punch around have circulated online as well, eliciting feelings of profound protectiveness as he runs back to his stuffed animal for safety and comfort.Japanese leaf-cutting artist Lito's (@lito_leafart) rendition of Punch and his stuffed animal (screenshot via Instagram)Creators celebrate Punch's bravery and steadfastness as he keeps trying to nestle into the new group of macaques while still being himself, ultimately showing how we all empathize with the little monkey.But as Punch's story unfolds, we can start to rest easy knowing that his hard work and perseverance is starting to pay off. The zoo has shared some photos and videos of the other macaques involving Punch in their groups, playing nicely with him, cuddling him, and doing some mutual grooming.Punch now hugs another macaque in the troop instead of just his stuffed orangutan.

(screenshot via X)Last year, we had to be brave like Tiki, the painfully shy rescue dog. This year, we need to keep being brave like baby Punch. The key message here is to be patient and keep trying.

    "body": "\n\tin Music, Television |   \tJanuary 16th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nMTV still exists. At least, it still exists in the Unit­ed States, or in cer­tain of that coun­try’s mar­kets, for the time being. A flur­ry of pre­ma­ture obit­u­ar­ies recent­ly blew through the inter­net after the announce­ment that the net­work had shut down in oth­er parts of the world, Europe includ­ed. But even there, some expressed the sen­ti­ment that MTV had already died long before. And indeed, in the U.S., where it orig­i­nal­ly launched, ask­ing who remem­bers when MTV actu­al­ly used to play music videos has been a com­mon lament for decades, aired even by gen­er­a­tions too young to remem­ber those days them­selves. But mem­bers of any gen­er­a­tion can now relive them — or live them for the first time — through a new site called MTV Rewind.\nThe first music video that greets the vis­i­tor is The Bug­gles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star,” and appro­pri­ate­ly so, since it inau­gu­rat­ed MTV itself when it went live on August 1st, 1981. What fol­lows are all the rest of the videos played on that first day, like Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight,” Blondie’s “Rap­ture,” David Bowie’s “Boys Keep Swing­ing,” and Kate Bush’s “Wuther­ing Heights.”\n(Oth­er, less wide­ly remem­bered entries include no few­er than three songs by Cliff Richard, which speaks to the then-incom­plete for­ma­tion of the kind of pop-musi­cal cul­ture we still asso­ciate with MTV.) The site’s oth­er playlists recre­ate oth­er eras and genre-spe­cif­ic pro­grams, from 120 Min­utes to Total Request Live, Head­banger’s Ball to Yo! MTV Raps.\nCur­rent­ly, MTV Rewind’s music video count comes to about 40,000, enough to ensure any for­mer addict of the net­work a stream of nos­tal­gia hits. But the site’s cre­ator (a 43-year-old Amer­i­can res­i­dent in Alba­nia, accord­ing to the New York Times, known pseu­do­ny­mous­ly as “Flex”) has also incor­po­rat­ed vin­tage sta­tion IDs and com­mer­cials, many of them liable to trig­ger down­right Prous­t­ian sen­sa­tions in the right view­er. What may feel refresh­ing even to curi­ous younger vis­i­tors is that, whichev­er chan­nel they choose, the next video that plays is deter­mined not by an algo­rithm attempt­ing to pre­dict their per­son­al tastes. Rather, each playlist is shaped by the pop­u­lar cul­ture of a par­tic­u­lar era, with enough left-field selec­tions to keep it inter­est­ing: just the sort of thing in hopes of which we used to flip over to MTV, back when the idea of stream­ing video on our com­put­ers still sound­ed like sheer­est fan­ta­sy.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom cheese wedges and leafy greens to loaves of bread and freshly picked zucchini, Eléonore Joulin has a tendency for playing with her food. In the Brussels-based artist’s work, a loaf of challah transforms into a vase, while a melting round of Raclette—a cheese originating in Switzerland that’s scraped right off the wheel onto baguettes or potatoes—transforms into a lighting fixture.\nJoulin is known for her lighthearted lamps and vessels resembling vegetables, sausages, and other foods. She enjoys experimenting with glazes, handcrafting her own in order to find finishes and hues that create a trompe-l’œil effect—as if, for example, cabbage leaves were simply folded into the shape of shoes. The durability of ceramics adds a playful tension to her subject, as we expect greens to wither and bread to turn moldy, yet these never will.\n\nMost recently, Joulin spent nearly six months trying to create a glaze-and-texture combination that would mimic wood. “I tried a lot of different ways, including an oxide juice technique and a fake wood rubber tool used by carpenters, but I ended with a combination of three matte glazes,” she tells Colossal. “I’m thinking of doing a cuckoo clock now—stay tuned!”\nExplore even more on Joulin’s Instagram. You might also enjoy Stephanie Shih’s nods to “domestic bliss” and Naomi Peterson’s confectionary-inspired “cup-cakes.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen I retire, I plan to read every morning and bake bread from scratch. I’d like to resume Spanish classes and finally become fluent. And I plan to see movies mid-afternoon, take long, leisurely walks leading nowhere in particular, and travel as much as possible. Does this sound familiar? \nDreaming of retirement is one coping mechanism many of us tap into, including director John Kelly. Along with his co-writer Tara Lawall, Kelly created a charming animated “Retirement Plan” detailing all the things he’d finally like to do as an older person no longer tethered to the office. He intends to play a single song impeccably on the piano, finally organize the pantry, and take a hike—or better yet, understand what the point of taking a hike is. \n\n\n\nWith the ability to make viewers both laugh and cry, the short film captures both the excitement of anticipation and the sometimes lackluster reality of finally diving in. As one commenter points out, the animation also checks a particular item off the protagonist’s list: “write a devastating yet optimistic piece of poetry.”\nWatch “Retirement Plan” above, and spend the rest of the day envisioning all the things you plan to do in that dreamworld we call retirement. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen a 65-year-old tree succumbed to a fungus known as oak wilt, Steve Parker wanted to pay tribute. The wooded habitat had previously loomed above Parker’s front yard and provided refuge to migratory birds. Rather than turn its limbs and trunk into mulch, though, Parker did as he often does with a material that’s no longer primed for its original purpose: he created a sound sculpture.\nRecently on view at Ivester Contemporary in Austin, “Funeral for a Tree” is a sprawling and poetic ode to the oak. Parker cut slices from the trunk that he then carved like vinyl, encoding bird song into the grain. When placed on a Victrola-style turntable, the records play the avian soundscapes.\n\n\n\nTo accompany these dirges, Parker also constructed a suspended brass and copper sculpture with tubing that splays like roots, some of which display blue-bag ventilators at their tips. These medical devices appear alongside CPAP machines in another installation of bark-clad limbs and vintage instruments known as shengs sourced from a Taipei flea market. \nEmphasizing breath and the rhythmic pulse of life, these additions also reference the artist’s late father. “The project emerged from Parker’s recognition that his grief for the tree echoed the loss of his father to cancer—both slow, inevitable declines where care could not prevent loss,” a statement says.\nWatch “Funeral for a Tree” in the video above, and find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo by Tiffany Camusci, courtesy Local 2110 UAW)\n    \n        \n            Staff at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City are officially unionized following a successful National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election, workers announced today, Friday, January 16.The formation of the Met Union under United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2110, which represents workers at cultural organizations across the city and elsewhere, comes months after staff first announced their intent to organize, cutting the need for pay parity, increased representation, and more transparency. Workers filed a petition with the NLRB, a step sometimes taken to form a union when the employing organization does not voluntarily recognize it, in November. The union will represent workers across 50 departments at the museum, including curators, librarians, conservators, visitor experience staff, and archivists. Originally, the union filed to represent 1,000 employees of the museum’s approximately 2,000-person workforce. Staff voted to form the union by a margin of 76%, with 542 voting in favor, 172 voting in opposition, and 100 not counted because the museum disputed their eligibility to belong to the union, according to UAW Local 2110.”We won because we were able to convince our colleagues that they don't have to accept whatever is offered to them, that their experience and hard work have earned them a seat at the table,” Rebecca Capua, a Met conservator, said in a statement released by UAW Local 2110.In a statement, a spokesperson for The Met said the institution “look[s] forward to engaging with the UAW as we pursue The Met’s mission to connect all people to creativity, knowledge, ideas, and one another.”“As one of the world’s leading art museums, The Met has long been committed to supporting its exceptional staff with highly competitive salaries and benefit packages that surpass industry standards; robust professional development opportunities; and a culture that values inclusivity, creativity, collaboration and excellence,” the spokesperson said. The institution said that over 600 of its employees earn more than $100,000 per year, and added that salaries have increased by 4% over the past five years. Alison Clark, a collections manager in the Asian Art Department, said in a statement that unionizing “is only our first step.”“We look forward to negotiating a fair and equitable contract that reflects staff needs and priorities,” Clark said.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Metropolitan Museum of Art\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            This spring, El Salvador will present a pavilion at the Venice Biennale for the first time in its history, during the contemporary art festival's 61st iteration from May 9 to November 22. Painter and sculptor J. Oscar Molina, born in El Salvador in 1971 and currently residing in Southampton, New York, will represent the country as its inaugural pavilion artist. Molina’s solo exhibition, Cartographies of the Displaced, will feature 15 to 18 of the artist’s abstract sculptures from his Children of the World (2019–ongoing) sculptural series, which evokes huddled figures in motion. News of El Salvador’s participation in the international art competition comes as human rights organizations condemn alleged abuses in the nation as a result of far-right Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s “war against gangs,” including torturous conditions at the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). Last year, the Trump administration deported over 200 Venezuelan men to the maximum security facility without due process.Sculptures from the \"Children of the World\" series on view at the Sala Nacional de Exposiciones Salarrué in San Salvador in 2024In an interview with Hyperallergic, Molina veered away from discussing El Salvador’s politics, but said his pavilion would explore aspects of what he described as the “migrant experience,” rooted in his flight from his home country during a 12-year bloody civil war between its US-backed military government and far-left guerrillas that lasted until 1992. With Cartographies of the Displaced, he said, he hopes to cultivate “patience and compassion for newcomers.”“Migration is a thing that transforms a human into a different type of human … the self being transformed into this being that doesn't exist there, and doesn't exist here, but exists somewhere,” Molina said. Molina recounted an idyllic childhood spent on his family farm in El Salvador alongside his parents and eight siblings before a bomb hit the corner of the concrete home they lived in when he was a young teenager. The government, he said, ordered his community to evacuate, at which point his family became displaced, moving from the mountains to the coastal municipality of La Unión.“For two years, we were just going from place to place,” Molina said. “We went from farmers to fishermen in a very short period of time.”Eventually, after he turned 16, his family decided to flee the country, and Molina and his brother, Abel, migrated to the US. “Abel was kind of my only family in the group of about 200 people, as we were crossing the desert in groups of tens,” Molina recalled. Molina came to the United States when he was 16 years old. In Southampton, Molina founded a stone masonry business, and by the time he was 30, he dedicated himself to his art, incorporating his migration story in his practice and opening a contemporary art gallery in the town in 2022. His work has previously appeared in exhibitions in El Salvador and in the US. The Venice Biennale pavilion was commissioned by the National Director of El Salvador's Ministry of Culture, Astrid Bahamond Panamá, and will be curated by Alejandra Cabezas. In an email to Hyperallergic, Cabezas said that El Salvador’s inclusion in this year’s Biennale is the result of a push by artists and cultural workers to recognize Salvadoran art abroad. “Our role is to ensure that the pavilion reflects the complexity, autonomy, and rigor of the community it represents,” Cabezas wrote, describing Molina’s work as representative of transnational identity, migration, and displacement, experiences common to some Salvadorans.“The aim is not to produce a national 'image' but to open a space where the nuances of Salvadoran and diasporic realities can be engaged with seriously,” Cabezas said.The Venice Biennale declined to confirm the Molina and the country’s participation in a statement to Hyperallergic and said it would announce an official list of countries and artists in late February. However, a number of countries, including the United States, have already publicized the artists selected for their respective pavilions. Molina said he strives for his pavilion exhibition to address universal themes beyond a specific political moment in his home country. “I know that there are so many rules that are being made by the minute, around the globe, but in all, I just want to make a sense of brotherhood,” Molina said. “We all need each other, from the top CEO of any corporation to the person who cleans the floor.”\n                  \n                      \n                        Feature\n                      \n                      \n                        Venice Biennale\n                      \n                      \n                        El Salvador\n                      \n                  \n        ",

This haunting, abraded pastel and paint work is part of the revelatory exhibition Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson.A longtime resident of Boston, a city that never developed an artistic identity as strong as New York’s or some other major US cities, Wilson was a painter, public sculptor, printmaker, teacher, children’s book illustrator, and activist. He was known and respected among fellow Black artists, yet practically invisible in the mainstream, White art world to the extent that his work is seldom included in surveys of modern and contemporary Black artists working in the United States. This much-needed exhibition — originating at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which holds the largest single collection of his art, at 90 works — should bring him the visibility he has long deserved.John Wilson, \"My Brother\" (1942), oil on panel; Smith College Museum of Art (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Wilson’s parents, who immigrated to the US from British Guiana (now Guyana), encouraged him to study art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. When he realized that Black people were not represented in the museum’s collection, he devoted himself to “witnessing [their] humanity.” This realization anticipates that of internationally recognized Black contemporary artists such as Kerry James Marshall, who told Griselda Murray Brown of the Financial Times, in 2018: \"It’s less about changing the narrative than it is about participating, being a part of it.”After graduating from Tufts University (which is connected to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts), he received the James William Paige Traveling Fellowship in 1947. It enabled him to go to Paris, where he studied with the French artist Fernand Léger. Wilson was attracted to Léger because of his socialist and humanist beliefs, and his commitment to celebrating the dignity of workers. These convictions would grow stronger for Wilson over the years, setting him apart from the American avant-garde’s growing commitment to art for art’s sake, a stance from which many Black artists felt understandably estranged, particularly at a time when the Civil Rights movement was beginning to foment.Installation view of Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (photo Hyla Skopitz, courtesy The Met)In the summer of 1949, after returning from Europe, Wilson taught at Camp Wo-Chi-Ca (an acronym for Worker’s Children’s Camp) in New Jersey, where he met Elizabeth Catlett and Paul Robeson. The next year, he visited Mexico on a John Hay Whitney Foundation grant, where he stayed until 1956, studying mural painting in Mexico City, and connecting with David Alfaro Siqueiros. His classmates included Catlett and Charles White, who would later teach and influence Kerry James Marshall’s art. Two things should be clear from Wilson’s biography. He, along with White, Catlett, and their peers, were where the action was and, like them, his story centers on being a Black artist determined to be “a part of the narrative,” particularly in terms of what it was like to live in the US in the 20th century. In this regard, Wilson is both important as an individual artist and essential to understanding American history and art. In fact, an institution should organize an exhibition highlighting the artists, writers, and others who taught at the interracial Camp Wo-Chi-Ca — among them, Jacob Lawrence, Gwendolyn Knight, and the dancer Pearl Primus. John Wilson, \"Streetcar Scene\" (1945), lithograph; The Metropolitan Museum of Art (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Wilson portrayed the gamut of the Black experience, making visible the sense of deep isolation, fear, and apprehension accompanying oppression and marginalization in the US, as well as pride, family, and community. His lithograph “Streetcar Scene” (1945) shows a Black Boston Navy Yard worker sitting in uniform on the streetcar, surrounded by mostly White women, all of whom ignore him. He looks at the viewer, his hands folded over his lunch box, dignified yet reticent, and highly conscious that he is the lone Black passenger. He seems to know in this situation that he must prove that he is nonthreatening — his uniform and button establish that he is a gainfully employed, productive member of society — and not interact with the other passengers.Among the exhibition’s 100-plus works is a charcoal drawing of Martin Luther King Jr. The face is both idealized and weary, while the torso is schematic. The horizontal and vertical lines dividing the head and torso can be read as a sign of King’s martyrdom and as the crosshairs of the assassin’s rifle. Nearby is a commanding eight-foot bronze maquette of King’s head, which was modeled in 1982 and cast in 2021. Also on view are pages from Wilson’s sketchbooks, including works from Paris and Mexico City that show him absorbing lessons from Léger and the Mexican muralists. I see these pieces as integral to his commitment to portraying the daily life of Black people in the US — their aspirations and fears. Anyone would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by Wilson’s synthesis of empathy and artistic ambition. In the 2002 “Self-Portrait” and the lithograph “City Child (1965), Wilson, inspired by Ralph Ellison’s novel Invisible Man (1952), addresses the invisibility experienced in this country by people of color. In the prologue, Ellison writes: “I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.” In a country where the president demonizes immigrants and people of color, Wilson’s work reminds us that beauty, art, and politics don’t have to be divided, and the right to be seen should never be decided by others.John Wilson and James Stroud, Center Street Studio, \"Martin Luther King Jr.\" (2002), etching and aquatint on chine collé; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (courtesy the Estate of John Wilson)Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson continues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1000 Fifth Avenue, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through February 8.

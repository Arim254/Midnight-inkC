Not long after the dis­cov­ery of Luray Cav­erns itself in 1878, its sta­lac­tites were found to res­onate through the under­ground space in an almost musi­cal fash­ion when struck — a prop­er­ty Leland W.

For the tech­ni­cal­ly mind­ed Sprin­kle, who worked at the Pen­ta­gon as a math­e­mati­cian and elec­tron­ics sci­en­tist, this must not have been quite as tedious a labor as it sounds.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nU7qsaVfn-8?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>The result was the biggest, the old­est (at least accord­ing to the age of the cave itself), and arguably the weird­est musi­cal instru­ment on Earth, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/09/watch-an-archaeologist-play-the-lithophone.html\">litho­phone</a> for the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry’s hero­ic age of engi­neer­ing.

But before that sem­i­nal film’s release, Fear was dis­cov­ered by John Belushi, who first caught the band on a local L.A. music show called <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dangerousminds.net/comments/all_25_episodes_of_new_wave_theatre_are_online\">New Wave The­atre</a></em> in 1980. He tracked down Ving, who <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-john-belushis-long-lost-punk-song-with-fear-20150910\">tells <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, “we had a cou­ple of beers and became fast friends.” At the time, Belushi was at work on his com­e­dy <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://screencrush.com/the-other-neighbors-belushi-aykroyd/\">Neigh­bors</a></em> with Dan Aykroyd and con­tract­ed the band to record a song for the film (his last before his death in 1982).</p>\n<p>The film’s pro­duc­ers, <em>Rolling Stone</em> writes, “were appalled” by the song “and refused to use it,” so to make it up to Ving and com­pa­ny, Belushi pushed to have the band booked on <em>Sat­ur­day Night Live</em> on Hal­loween, 1981. The result­ing per­for­mance has become leg­endary for what hap­pened, and what didn’t, and led to Fear becom­ing, says Ving, “one of the esteemed mem­bers of the per­ma­nent­ly banned.” You can watch a clip above of the band play­ing “Beef Boloney” and “New York’s Alright if You Like Sax­o­phones” (intro­duced by Don­ald Pleas­ance), and just below see Ving in a clip from an inter­view show dis­cussing the ill-fat­ed gig.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UqCxyC5QQBA?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Belushi stage-man­aged the band’s appear­ance, striv­ing for authen­tic­i­ty by bring­ing into the stu­dio what Ving calls “an actu­al punk rock audi­ence rather than just Mr. and Mrs. Mis­souri.” (That audi­ence includ­ed now-leg­ends Ian MacK­aye of Minor Threat and Fugazi, mem­bers of New York hard­core band the Cro-Mags, and Tesco Vee of the Meat­men.)  The result­ing mosh pit was noth­ing out of the ordi­nary for the typ­i­cal punk show. But, unsur­pris­ing­ly, “the real audi­ence at <em>Sat­ur­day Night Live</em> was scared to death,” says Ving, “They didn’t know what was hap­pen­ing with all the may­hem.”</p>\n<p>Dur­ing the riotous pro­ceed­ings, <em>SNL</em> pro­duc­er Dick Eber­sol “got hit in the chest with a pump­kin,” some equip­ment was dam­aged, and dur­ing the final song, “Let’s Have a War,” an audi­ence mem­ber grabbed the micro­phone and yelled out “F*ck New York!” The pro­fan­i­ty freaked out NBC, who cut the broad­cast short and shelved the footage for sev­er­al years. The <em>New York Post</em> lat­er quot­ed an unnamed NBC tech­ni­cian as say­ing, “This was a life-threat­en­ing sit­u­a­tion. They went crazy. It’s amaz­ing no one got killed.” The paper also quot­ed a fig­ure of $400,000 for dam­ages to the Rock­e­feller Cen­ter set.</p>\n<p>But as <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9yQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT14&ots=n8hOHBJ1Mg&dq=NY%20Post%20SNL%20Riot%20Fear&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false\">Bill­board </a></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9yQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT14&ots=n8hOHBJ1Mg&dq=NY%20Post%20SNL%20Riot%20Fear&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q&f=false\">report­ed two weeks lat­er</a>, the fig­ure was total­ly erro­neous (sup­plied to the <em>Post</em> by Ving as a prac­ti­cal joke, as he says above). “We had to pay $40 in labor penal­ties. That was the extent of it,” said <em>SNL</em> spokesman Peter Hamil­ton. As for the shock to view­ers, it seems the net­work received “all of 12 com­plaints” after the broad­cast. Ving him­self found the over­re­ac­tion ridicu­lous, and NBC’s long shelv­ing of the footage—only recent­ly made avail­able in a trun­cat­ed version—a humor­less mis­take. “They seem to be… los­ing the sense of humor about the whole idea,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “I had a sense of humor at the whole idea of start­ing Fear. It was extreme­ly humor­ous to me, and I think John saw that humor.”</p>\n<p>Indeed he did, but Belushi’s appre­ci­a­tion for Fear’s antics was ahead of its time. Now we can see, at least in part, what all the fuss was about. And we can also final­ly hear the long-shelved sin­gle for <em>Neigh­bors</em> that Belushi record­ed with the band.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/q55wNcD-Haw?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Stunt That Got Elvis Costello Banned From <i>Saturday Night Live</i> (1977)\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/09/the-stunt-that-got-elvis-costello-banned-from-saturday-night-live.html\">The Stunt That Got Elvis Costel­lo Banned From <i>Sat­ur­day Night Live</i> (1977)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Birth of the Blues Brothers: How Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi Started Introducing a New Generation to the Blues\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/04/the-birth-of-the-blues-brothers.html\">The Birth of the Blues Broth­ers: How Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi Start­ed Intro­duc­ing a New Gen­er­a­tion to the Blues</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to <i>Saturday Night Live</i>’s Very First Sketch: Watch John Belushi Launch SNL in October, 1975\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/03/saturday-night-lives-very-first-sketch.html\"><i>Sat­ur­day Night Live</i>’s Very First Sketch: Watch John Belushi Launch SNL in Octo­ber, 1975</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>"

Themes of memory, mortality, connection, identity, and belonging weave through Shiota’s pieces, exploring “how pain, displacement, boundaries, and existential uncertainty shape the human condition and our understanding of self,” the gallery says.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of a full-room installation of red fiber and paper pages by Chiharu Shiota\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-640x461.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-960x692.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-768x554.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-1536x1107.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Diary” (2025) in ‘Chiharu Shiota: Two Home Countries’ at Japan Society Gallery, New York, 2025</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An expansive, room-sized work titled “Diary,” which is based on an <a href=\"https://www.chiharu-shiota.com/diary-1\" target=\"_blank\">earlier installation</a> and commissioned anew for <em>Two Home Countries, </em>incorporates a dense web of yarn in which float pages of journals that once belonged to Japanese soldiers. Some were also penned by German civilians in the post-war era. “The accumulated pages reveal an expansive record of shared human existence across national boundaries,” the gallery says.</p>\n<p>“When the body is gone, the objects which surrounded them remain behind,” Shiota says in a statement. “As I wander the stalls of the markets in Berlin, I find especially personal items like photographs, old passports, and personal diaries. Once, I found a diary from 1946, which was an intimate insight into the person’s life and experiences.” For Shiota, the power of these objects are revealed in how she feels the presence of writer’s “inner self.”</p>\n<p><em>Two Home Countries </em>is on view through January 11 in New York City.

While Craig is based in New York, and Karl is based in London, the two collaborate across the pond—and around the world—to produce multimedia installations that revitalize urban spaces and celebrate the power of play.</p>\n<p>As part of the 2025 <a href=\"https://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Brisbane Festival</a>, Craig & Karl created a pair of large-scale inflatable interventions on two of the city’s bridges, both riffing on the idea of the arch as passageway. Additionally, numerous illustrations, interactive sculptures, and inflatable “Mateys” — a series of quirky characters with expressive faces — pop up on buildings and sidewalks to enable joyful encounters as part of the expansive, city-wide exhibition titled <em>Rear Vision.</em></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg\" alt=\"colorful, inflatable arches by Craig & Karl are installed on a long bridge in Bisbrane, illuminated at night\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/craig-karl-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Walk This Way” (2025), Kangaroo Point Bridge, Brisbane.

The expressive, flexible characters are also immanently relatable for viewers of all ages. “The Mateys serve as companions that help foster community and shared experiences, welcoming us into different corners of the city,” says a festival statement.</p>\n<p>Craig & Karl are known for their vivid participatory projects, which range from mini-golf courses to playgrounds to murals. The artists initially met 30 years ago while studying at Griffith University in Brisbane, and since, their collaborative practice has included partnerships with global brands and publications like Adidas, Nike, Apple, Chanel, <em>The New Yorker, Variety, </em>and more.</p>\n<p>While the bridge installations came to a close at the end of September, you can still stroll along the <em>Public Art Trail</em> through October 20 to spot Craig & Karl’s sculptures and installations in unexpected places.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Throughout history, those who wield the most power or resources are typically the ones whose stories are represented in textbooks, passed down through generations, and etched into our collective consciousness. Without intentional effort, it can be difficult to hear more than a single narrative.</p>\n<p>In art history, the reality is much the same. The canon has always privileged white male artists, from titans of the Renaissance like Michelangelo to bad-boy American Modernists like Jackson Pollock. The foundations of 19th-century American landscape painting, for example, are inextricable from the belief in Manifest Destiny, as the American government violently expanded westward. And Western painting and sculpture have historically reigned supreme in the market-driven hallows of galleries and auction houses. But what of the incredible breadth of—namely Indigenous—art forms that have long been overlooked?</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8.jpg\" alt=\"a columnar, geometric sculpture by Dyani White Hawk coated in patterns of beadwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-1366x2048.jpg 1366w\" /><figcaption>“Visiting” (2024), acrylic, glass beads, thread, and synthetic sinew on aluminum panel with a quartz base, 120 x 15.5 x 15.5 inches (base 5 x 24 x 24 inches).

Photo by Rik Sferra</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For Sičáŋǧu Lakota artist <a href=\"https://www.dyaniwhitehawk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dyani White Hawk</a>, the construction of American art history lies at the core of her multidisciplinary practice. “She lays bare the exclusionary hierarchies that have long governed cultural legitimacy, authority, value, and visibility,” says a joint statement from Alexander Gray Associates and Bockley Gallery. “In this light, White Hawk reframes Indigenous art and Western abstraction as inseparable practices—linked by a shared history that dominant narratives have labored to separate and obscure.”</p>\n<p>Pablo Picasso is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20141112-great-artists-steal\" target=\"_blank\">credited</a> with the saying, “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” Seminal paintings like “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” and others created in the early 1900s would not exist if it were not for his fascination with African masks. White Hawk draws a similar parallel between the 20th-century Color Field and Minimalism movements to highlight the influence of Native American art forms in the evolution of these styles. She prompts viewers to consider how these notions shape our aesthetic perceptions and judgment while also considering the role of cultural memory and community.</p>\n<p>White Hawk’s work spans painting, sculpture, photography, performance, and installations. Alongside oil and acrylic paint, she incorporates materials commonly used in Lakota art forms, like beads, porcupine quills, and buckskin.</p>\n<p>“I strive to create honest, inclusive works that draw from the breadth of my life experiences,” White Hawk says in a statement, merging influences from Native and non-Native, urban, academic, and cultural education systems. She continues: “This allows me to start from center, deepening my own understanding of the intricacies of self and culture, correlations between personal and national history, and Indigenous and mainstream art histories.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5.jpg\" alt=\"a geometric patterned wall installation by Dyani White Hawk of a Native American pattern\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-640x368.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-960x552.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-768x442.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-1536x884.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Nourish” (2024), ceramic tile installation of handmade tiles by Mercury Mosaics, 174 x 369 1/2 inches.

Vibrant geometric patterns are direct and visceral in a way that “unsettles the categories of Eurocentric art history,” the galleries say.</p>\n<p>White Hawk notes that her mixed-media canvases honor “the importance of the contributions of Lakota women and Indigenous artists to our national artistic history…as well as the ways in which Indigenous artists helped shape the evolution of the practices of Western artists who were inspired by their work.”</p>\n<p>“Nourish,” an installation that spans nearly 31 feet wide and 14.5 feet tall, comprises thousands of handmade ceramic tiles that visually reference Lakota beadwork and quillwork. Permanently installed at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the piece enters into a dialogue with the history of American Modernism through painters such as Marsden Hartley and Pollock, who are credited as trailblazers of American abstraction and yet were indelibly influenced by Native American art.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of a geometric sculpture by Dyani White Hawk coated in patterns of beadwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-1366x2048.jpg 1366w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Visiting.” Collection of the Denver Art Museum.

Her work invites viewers to evaluate current societal value systems and their capacity to support equitable futures.”</p>\n<p>Minneapolis-based Bockley Gallery, which has represented White Hawk for more than a decade, has recently announced co-representation of the artist with New York City-based Alexander Gray Associates, where she’ll present a solo exhibition in fall 2026. If you’re in Minneapolis, <em>Love Language </em>opens on October 18 at the <a href=\"https://walkerart.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Walker Art Center</a> and continues through February 15. The show then travels to <a href=\"https://remaimodern.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Remai Modern</a> in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where it will be on view from April 25 to September 27, 2026.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Say you visit a highly anticipated exhibition one Saturday afternoon and find yourself in a crowded gallery, shoulder-to-shoulder with a pack of rabid art goers. As you stealthily maneuver toward your viewing target, an over-stimulated (or, depending on the show, perhaps under-stimulated) child begins to melt down. You suddenly overhear an unreasonably heated conversation about brunch plans. Your heartbeat quickens, and soon, art gallery panic sets in. How do you return to the piece in front of you while also reclaiming your peace of mind?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1120735582?fl=pl&fe=sh\" target=\"_blank\">A collaborative film</a> by animator Gaia Alari and therapist Emily Price visualizes how art can help us get in tune with our senses and emotions. Paired with Alari’s dynamic drawings, Price guides viewers through an exercise designed to focus our attention even in the most anxious or gloomy of situations. Put your hands on your heart and stomach, she suggests, or imagine yourself protected in a cloche or invisibility cape, allowing yourself to feel calm and safe.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1120735582?dnt=1&app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p>“How does your body react to art?” is produced by MoMA, which also released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/1221\">a long-form interview</a> with Price that dives into the psychology of a museum visit.

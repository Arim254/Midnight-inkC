    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tNovember 10th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs many as a mil­lion peo­ple crossed the Gold­en Gate Bridge on foot to cel­e­brate the 50th anniver­sary of its con­struc­tion in 1987. More than a few of them would have remem­bered San Fran­cis­co as it was before it had its most icon­ic struc­ture — and indeed, some would even remem­ber walk­ing across it once before, on its inau­gur­al “Pedes­tri­an Day” in 1937. Bar­ring the pos­si­bil­i­ty of unusu­al­ly vig­or­ous super­cente­nar­i­ans, that won’t be the case eight years from now, on the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s 100th anniver­sary. But we’ll still be able to appre­ci­ate the enor­mous ambi­tion of its builders, not least its chief design engi­neer Joseph Strauss, who, along with Charles Alton Ellis, made pos­si­ble a project long assumed impos­si­ble.\nThe video from Sabin Civ­il Engi­neer­ing at the top of the post explains every stage of the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s design and con­struc­tion. Build­ing a sus­pen­sion bridge over the Gold­en Gate, the deep strait between San Fran­cis­co Bay and the Pacif­ic Ocean, posed for­mi­da­ble chal­lenges. The dis­tinc­tive shape we know from so many pho­tographs emerged in part from the need to anchor the bridge in such a way as to bal­ance out the mas­sive forces that would oth­er­wise bend its tow­ers inward, and the steel-on-steel con­struc­tion of its sus­penders and deck was nec­es­sary to pre­vent cat­a­stroph­ic crack for­ma­tion.\nThe deck hangs from 250 pairs of cables, and each of the main cables that run the length of the bridge actu­al­ly con­sists of 27,000 steel wires wound togeth­er. A sys­tem of ther­mal expan­sion joints accom­mo­dates reg­u­lar elon­ga­tion and shrink­age of near­ly four feet.\n\n\n\t\n\nAnd we haven’t even got into the under­wa­ter blast­ing and ter­ri­fy­ing-look­ing drilling work required to put up the tow­ers in the first place. In any case, the painstak­ing efforts of the engi­neers and labor­ers alike have sure­ly been vin­di­cat­ed by the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s func­tion­al­i­ty and pop­u­lar­i­ty over the past 88 years. Nat­u­ral­ly, it’s had to under­go con­sid­er­able main­te­nance and retro­fitting in that time, and it would take a true roman­tic to ignore its lim­i­ta­tions entire­ly. (Take its lack of rail capac­i­ty, which was nei­ther tech­ni­cal­ly nor eco­nom­i­cal­ly fea­si­ble to incor­po­rate dur­ing the Great Depres­sion.) Still, when 300,000 peo­ple jammed them­selves onto its deck at once on its 50th anniver­sary, it may have bent in the mid­dle, but it did­n’t break. That was a tes­ta­ment to the civ­il engi­neer­ing acu­men of Strauss and com­pa­ny — but let’s hope the cen­te­nary fes­tiv­i­ties are bet­ter orga­nized.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n“The Bay Lights,” the World’s Largest LED Light Sculp­ture, Debuts in San Fran­cis­co\nThe 5 Inno­v­a­tive Bridges That Make New York City, New York City\nHow the Brook­lyn Bridge Was Built: The Sto­ry of One of the Great­est Engi­neer­ing Feats in His­to­ry\nA Mes­mer­iz­ing Trip Across the Brook­lyn Bridge: Watch Footage from 1899\nWhy There Isn’t a Bridge from Italy to Sici­ly – And Why the 2,000-Year-Old Dream of Build­ing the Bridge May Soon Be Real­ized\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tNovember 10th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nIn addi­tion to the icon­ic scene in Jim Henson’s Labyrinth, or appear­ances in ani­mat­ed TV shows and video games, M.C. Esch­er’s work has adorned the cov­ers of albums like Mott the Hoople’s 1969 debut and the spec­u­la­tive fic­tion of Ita­lo Calvi­no and Jorge Luis Borges. A big hit with hip­pies and 1960s col­lege stu­dents, writes Heavy Music Art­work, his mind-bend­ing prints became asso­ci­at­ed with “ques­tion­ing accept­ed views of nor­mal expe­ri­ence and test­ing the lim­its of per­cep­tion with hal­lu­cino­genic drugs.” While he appre­ci­at­ed his cult fol­low­ing, Esch­er “did not encour­age their mys­ti­cal inter­pre­ta­tions of his images.” Reply­ing to one enthu­si­as­tic fan of his print Rep­tiles, who claimed to see in it an image of rein­car­na­tion, Esch­er replied, “Madame, if that’s the way you see it, so be it.”\n\nRather than illus­trate high­er states of con­scious­ness or meta­phys­i­cal enti­ties, Bruno Ernst writes in The Mag­ic Mir­ror of M.C. Esch­er, the artist intend­ed to cre­ate prac­ti­cal, “pic­to­r­i­al rep­re­sen­ta­tion of intel­lec­tu­al under­stand­ing.” Illus­tra­tions, that is, of philo­soph­i­cal and sci­en­tif­ic thought exper­i­ments. The son of a civ­il engi­neer, Esch­er began his stud­ies in archi­tec­ture before mov­ing to draw­ing and print­mak­ing.\nThe chal­lenge of cre­at­ing built environments—even seem­ing­ly impos­si­ble ones—always seemed to occu­py his mind. Along with themes from the nat­ur­al world, a high per­cent­age of his works cen­ter on buildings—inspired by for­ma­tive ear­ly years in Rome and his admi­ra­tion for Islam­ic art and Span­ish archi­tec­ture.\n\nIn the 50s and 60s Escher’s art piqued the inter­est of aca­d­e­mics and math­e­mati­cians, an audi­ence he found more con­ge­nial to his vision. He cor­re­spond­ed with sci­en­tists and incor­po­rat­ed their ideas into his work, mean­while claim­ing to be “absolute­ly inno­cent of train­ing or knowl­edge in the exact sci­ences.” In the 50s, Esch­er “daz­zled” the likes of math­e­mati­cians like Roger Pen­rose and HSM Cox­eter. In turn, notes Maev Kennedy, he “was inspired by Penrose’s per­spec­ti­val tri­an­gle and Coxeter’s work on crys­tal sym­me­try.”\n\nFor all the excite­ment he cre­at­ed among math­e­mati­cians, it took a bit longer for Esch­er to get noticed in the art world. When Penrose’s uncle showed Escher’s ver­sion of the per­spec­ti­val tri­an­gle to Picas­so, “Picas­so had heard of the British math­e­mati­cian but not of the Dutch artist.” Escher’s fame spread out­side of the sci­ences in part through the inter­ests of the coun­ter­cul­ture. He may have shrugged off mys­ti­cal and psy­che­del­ic read­ings of his prints, but he had an innate pen­chant for the mar­velous­ly weird (see his copy of a scene, for exam­ple, from Hierony­mus Bosch, above, or his sur­re­al print Grav­i­ty, below).\n\nSee the prints pic­tured here and a few dozen more dig­i­tized in high res­o­lu­tion at Dig­i­tal Com­mon­wealth, cour­tesy of Boston Pub­lic Library, who scanned their Esch­er col­lec­tion and made it avail­able to the pub­lic. Zoom into the fine details of prints like Inside Saint Peter’s, fur­ther up—a fine­ly ren­dered but oth­er­wise not-espe­cial­ly-Esch­er-like work—and the labyrinthine Ascend­ing and Descend­ing at the top. Whether—as Har­vard Library cura­tor John Over­holt confesses—you’re a “nerd who loves M.C. Esch­er” for his math­e­mat­i­cal mind, an artist with a mys­ti­cal bent who loves him for his hal­lu­ci­na­to­ry qual­i­ties, or some mea­sure of both, you’ll find exact­ly the Esch­er you’re look­ing for in this dig­i­tal gallery.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2018.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEnter an Online Inter­ac­tive Doc­u­men­tary on M.C.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAli Eyal, \"And Look Where I Went\" (2025), oil on linen (all photos Alex Paik/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nLOS ANGELES — The seventh iteration of Made in L.A., the Hammer Museum’s biennial exhibition showcasing artists working in the greater Los Angeles area, contains few surprises. The curators’ self described “no-methodology methodology” results in a scattered exhibition that feels bland and curatorially unimaginative. \nDespite this, the show contains some strong work, especially in cases where the artists have been given their own rooms — for example, Hannah Hur’s gorgeous five-panel installation “Suspension” (2025), installed in a vault-like gallery. Each painted panel consists of a grid of faint white lines dotted with white flower-like patterns. The interaction between the grid and the flower motif creates a sense of spatial confusion when viewing the work. This effect is only enhanced by the room’s architecture: The lines in the cement floor and the curved shadows cast from a panel, which appears to be floating in midair, become a vital part of the viewing experience. Hur’s quiet work transforms one’s perception of both the viewer’s physical space and the spaces she creates within each painting.\nInstallation view of Hanna Hur, “Suspension” (2025), acrylic, colored pencil, Flashe, and pigment on canvas\nNa Mira disorients histories and mythologies in “Sugungga (Hello)” (2025).” The work references a Korean allegory in which a sick dragon king trying to cure itself lures and is subsequently tricked by a rabbit. Two videos are projected onto opposite sides of a holographic glass — one filmed in a cab driving around the outside perimeter of a walled former military building, constructed by the Japanese army and later used as a US military base, and the other showing an inflatable rabbit sculpture inside of the grounds. These projections collapse inside and outside. They cast ghostly moving shadows and distorted imagery around the room and onto other viewers. The story of Korea’s occupiers is literally embodied by this one building, and the work’s confusing boundaries cast the viewer as both victim and complicit co-conspirator, as both inside and outside systems of power.\nAnother standout is an assemblage by Gabriela Ruiz comprised of cartoonishly painted screaming faces, a surveillance camera that displays the viewer on a screen, and an LED streetlamp. This piece perfectly embodies our fraught relationship with technology, wherein we willingly allow ourselves to be surveilled by social media platforms under the guise of connecting with others. These platforms have also manipulated and damaged our thought patterns, siloing us into our own personalized echo chambers and flattening commerce, memes, life milestones, and horrifying news clips into a single bland stream of content vying for our attention. The work is appropriately titled “Collective Scream” (2025).\n\nGabriela Ruiz, “Collective Scream” (2025), acrylic, gouache, pastel, colored pencil, acrylic pens, epoxy clay, metal hooks, metal pipes, metal hardware, LCD monitors, TV monitor, roll-up gate, LED streetlamp, and surveillance camera on wood panel\nOther highlights include Amanda Ross-Ho’s hilarious and poignant oversized replicas of her father’s residential nursing home door adorned with seasonal decorations, Carl Cheng’s singular erosion machines, and Patrick Martinez’s installation of a ruined and graffiti’d cinderblock structure, “Battle of the City on Fire” (2025).\nWithout a clear curatorial thesis, Made in L.A. reverts to the default modus operandi of large museum group exhibitions, which is to add legitimacy and cultural capital to artists who have already been vetted by the market or other institutions. Even as a relative newcomer to Los Angeles (I moved here about five years ago), many of the artists included are already familiar to me and have been showing regularly throughout the city. I’d love to see the next Made in L.A. go “off menu” a little more. \n\nNa Mira, “Sugungga (Hello)” (2024), two-channel Hi8 and HD video, holographic glass, 14 min.\nPatrick Martinez, “Battle of the City on Fire” (2025), stucco, cinder blocks, neon, acrylic paint, spray paint and latex house paint on scorched panel\nCarl Cheng, “Alternative TV #9” (1979–2016), plastic chassis, acrylic water tank, LED lighting and controller, electrical components, conglomerated rocks, and plastic plants\nBruce Yonemoto, “Broken Fences” (2025), monitors, lacquer, wood\nAmanda Ross-Ho, work from the series Untitled Thresholds (FOUR SEASONS) (2025)\nAlake Shilling, “Is there hope for me once more” (2025), glazed ceramic\nMade in L.A. 2025 continues at the Hammer Museum (10899 Wilshire Boulevard, Westwood, Los Angeles) through March 1, 2026.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoco Fusco, \"A Room of One's Own: Women and Power in\nthe New America\" (2006–8), performance documentation (image courtesy the artist and Mendes Wood DM; all other photos Clara Maria Apostolatos/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nFew artists have examined the ethnographic gaze as closely — or turned it as deftly back on itself — as Coco Fusco. Across her career, she has inhabited a succession of roles — museum specimen, interrogator, colonial queen, subaltern laborer — to expose the systems that produce them. Her works, whether filmed, staged, or photographed, return to that charged encounter so that what began as performances about being looked at has evolved into frameworks for looking back: at surveillance, at the museum’s apparatus of display, at the camera’s complicity, at the viewer’s own position within it. Fusco’s first United States retrospective, Tomorrow I Will Become an Island at El Museo del Barrio, traces this evolving choreography of perception.\nThe show is divided into four loosely thematic sections titled “Migration,” “Cultural Encounter,” “Interrogation,” and “Poetry and Power.” In “Els Segadors” (2023), part of the first section, a diverse grouping of Catalans recites the centuries-old anthem of independence — banned during Francisco Franco’s dictatorship in the mid-20th century and later revived as a symbol of sovereignty — reflecting on what the song now means to them. Filmed in a single, frontal frame and intercut with candid exchanges between Fusco and her participants, the work lets the performance slowly fray: pride gives way to hesitation, patriotism to unease, until talk of belonging turns to acknowledgements of exclusion. Voices slip between Catalan and Spanish, color alternates with grayscale, and the anthem mutates through salsa, folk, and rap. Each shift introduces a hybridity that unsettles a fixed sense of Catalan identity; each slippage loosens the seams of the nationalist script it supposedly restages.\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La Plaza Vacía (The Empty Plaza)” (2012), HD Video, 11:53 min\n“Els Segadors” unfolds from a script that gradually breaks open, a form that applies to much of her work, including her photographs. Rounding out the same gallery, for instance, is a continuous band of black and white portraits depicting immigrants, friends, and strangers alike, posed against urban and domestic backdrops. Taken over the past year — a period shadowed by immigration raids — “Everyone Who Lives Here Is a New Yorker” (2025) initially reads as a set of informal yet intimate portraits. Only when we cross the room to encounter Augustus Frederick Sherman and Lewis Hine’s early-20th-century photographs of immigrants, hung in a grid, does it become clear that Fusco has staged her sitters to mirror the archival compositions. The people in “Venezuelan family in Queens” sit in a neat alignment echoing Sherman’s “English Family at Ellis Island” (undated), while the beaming subjects in “Ecuadorian child vendors” holding bouquets reanimate Hine’s “Child Vendors, Bowery, 1910,” their smiles lending warmth to an iconic image once used to spur legislation around child labor. Notably, though her photographs are explicit citations of immigrant portraiture, they position people not by the conditions of their arrival but in the particular ways they belong to New York.\nThat studied quality defines much of the retrospective. Fusco’s performances often borrow from institutional procedures: She recreates military drills in “A Room of One’s Own: Women and Power in the New America” (2006–08) and enrolls in an immersive simulation and workshop on military interrogation in “Operation Atropos” (2006), dissecting the grammar of disciplinary systems. Her videos carry the same investigative and elegiac impulse. Works such as “La confesión” and “La Plaza vacía” (both 2012) consider Cuban national memory, splicing found footage, oral histories, historical documents, partial testimonies, and Fusco’s measured voice-over to trace the afterlives of the Cuban revolution. Watching the hours of accumulated testimony and archival fragments feels like joining her in the act of sifting. She speaks with the cadence of a reporter — methodical, informed, occasionally weary. Her editing, however, reveals an equally strong pull toward metaphor: Long takes of the deserted Plaza de la Revolución watched over by the monumental steel portraits of Castro and Che Guevara alternate with archival footage of military spectacle, the vacant square and its flattened icons mirroring the hollowed-out ideals of the revolution itself.\n\nDetail of Coco Fusco, “Everyone Who Lives Here is a New Yorker” (2025), 12 sets of pigment prints\nPart of the “Cultural Encounter” section is a room that revisits Fusco’s earliest and most overt acts of institutional critique. “Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit The West” (1992–94), made with Guillermo Gómez-Peña, is represented through photo documentation and a reconstruction of the original cage. It satirizes the enclosures once used to display Indigenous peoples at world’s fairs and museums, a practice that continued well into the 20th century, as a timeline on the wall makes clear. The artists — dressed in hand-sewn grass skirts, leather wristbands, and red face paint or masks — pose as “undiscovered natives,” staging an ethnographic fantasy of “discovery” and display. The cage’s mix of props — a Kahlúa Tiki decanter on a European-capitals tablecloth beside a Mickey Mouse rug and TV — collapses distinctions between “authentic” cultural emblem and mass-produced commodity. The effect underscores the manufactured nature of such “human zoo” displays as spectacles of staged authenticity — a dynamic that, Fusco and Gómez-Peña imply, museums risk repeating when they package non-Western cultures for display.\nIn this new installation, the cage has been restaged with its door open so that visitors can step inside and watch a documentary on the original performance playing on a small television within. The gesture shifts the work’s meaning: Rather than observing the ethnographic gaze from a distance, viewers are invited to experience what it feels like to inhabit its frame. Nearby, a wall text quotes a song by Los Tigres del Norte: “Even if the cage is made of gold, it is still a prison,” a line that echoes Fusco’s own skepticism about the art world’s liberal pieties. The cage, in this sense, stands for the structure of representation itself — one that offers visibility while preserving established hierarchies.\n\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West” (1992/2025), multimedia installation\nStill, the question remains: What exactly do we expect from critique now? To see this piece here in El Museo is to face a quiet symmetry between an artist who once staged marginalization as spectacle and a museum born from the Puerto Rican community organizing against such exclusion. Nearby archival materials from the 1997 work “La Chavela Realty Company” seem to address such frictions directly. They show Fusco dressed as Queen Isabel la Católica, the 15th-century monarch who financed Columbus’s voyage, offering parcels of the New World for sale at a dollar apiece. Among the “buyers” is El Museo del Barrio’s former director, whose signed deed now hangs beside photographic documentation and a campy golden gown with ship-shaped headdress designed by artist Pepón Osorio. Printed over a map and written in irreverent Spanglish, the deed is both grandiose and absurd. Presented here, the joke becomes self-referential, a correspondence between artist and institution. It leaves open a question of position — what kind of critical distance is still possible from the inside? Is maintaining proximity to institutions the only viable mode of holding power accountable?\nOne of the concluding works, “Your Eyes Will Be an Empty Word” (2021), offers something like an answer. In it, Fusco rows around Hart Island — the largest mass grave in the United States, where formerly enslaved and unhoused people and victims of epidemics such as COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS are buried — reciting a verse by Cuban poet Dulce María Loynaz about isolation and endurance. The camera drifts steadily, oars cutting through deep blue water, while violins draw out mournful, long-held notes. The allegorical image clarifies Fusco’s political stance as well as circles back to the exhibition’s title. To “become an island” is to maintain autonomy within systems that consume difference, to stay apart without retreating. Across three decades, Fusco has traced what happens when ideology isolates, when nations and individuals retreat behind physical and political borders. Yet the exhibition suggests that to “become an island” may also be to claim autonomy, to inhabit the structures of power without surrendering to them.\n\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La Chavela Realty Company” (1991) (left) and performance documentation of “La Chavela Realty Company” (1991) (right)\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Your Eyes Will Be an Empty Word” (2021)\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West” (1992/2025), multimedia installation\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La confesión (The Confession)” (2015), HD Video, 33:06 minutes\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La Chavela Realty Company” (1991) \nInstallation view of photos by Augustus Frederick Sherman and Lewis Hine \nInstallation view of Coco Fusco: Tomorrow, I Will Become an Island\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Els Segadors (The Reapers)” (2001), video, 22 min\nCoco Fusco: Tomorrow, I Will Become an Island continues at El Museo del Barrio (1230 5th Avenue, East Harlem, New York) through January 11, 2026.

    "body": "\n\tGalleries Sprüth Magers and Skarstedt have announced that they will be taking on joint representation of artist George Condo. The deal means that Condo will no longer be represented by Hauser & Wirth, which first started working with the artist in late 2019.\n\n\tCondo has a long history with both galleries. He first started showing with Sprüth Magers cofounder Monika Sprüth in 1984, around a year after opening Monika Sprüth Gallery. (She would merge with dealer Philomene Magers to form Sprüth Magers in 1998.) Prior to joining Hauser & Wirth, Condo had also been represented by Skarstedt, from 2004 to 2019.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tIn a statement to ARTnews, Sprüth said, “It has been an honor to work with George Condo since he was an artist just starting out in the early 1980s, and to support his career as it has flourished over the years. His first exhibition at Galerie Monika Sprüth in 1984, one of the gallery’s first shows, cemented his position as a groundbreaking painter not just in New York but as part of the international art scene.”  \n\n\tCondo’s most recent exhibition with Hauser & Wirth was a two-venue collaboration that appeared at the gallery’s new SoHo space, running from January to April of this year. (The other venue was Sprüth Magers’s Upper East Side location.)\n\n\tIn an email to ARTnews, Iwan Wirth, Hauser & Wirth’s founder and president, said, “George Condo is a remarkable artist, and it has been a privilege to work with him over the past six years. I am deeply proud of all we’ve achieved together, and we will continue to celebrate George’s every success.”\n\n\tCondo is best known for his eye-catching portraits that synthesize various art historical references, stretching back from 17th-century Dutch painting and Cubism and Surrealism in the early 20th century to the postwar era’s Pop art. In a single Condo exhibition, references from Picasso, Matisse, Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Willem de Kooning, and Francis Bacon are all likely to appear. In addition to his paintings, he also produces works on paper and sculpture.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGeorge Condo, The Clown Maker, 1984. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy Sprüth Magers and Skarstedt/Private Collection\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCondo is among today’s most sought-after blue-chip artists. His auction record currently stands at $6.8 million, set when his 2010 painting Force Field sold at a Christie’s Hong Kong auction in 2020, shortly after he joined Hauser & Wirth. His record was already over $6 million, achieved when Nude and Forms (2014) sold for $6.2 million at Christie’s New York in 2018. More recently, his Prescription for the Clinically Normal (2012) sold for $6.2 million at Christie’s Hong Kong in September 2024.\n\n\n\tEven Condo’s works on paper sell for six to seven figures. The 2025 two-venue exhibition, titled “Pastels” and displaying 20 works on paper, were priced between $600,000 and $1.5 million, according to a report by Artnet News. That report also noted that in 2024, Condo’s art generated $39.2 million at auction, the third highest for a living artist.\n\n\tAt Art Basel Paris, Hauser & Wirth reported selling a new Condo painting, Femme de Monaco, for $1.85 million during the fair’s newly introduced Avant Première, an ultra-exclusive event the night before the first VIP preview day in which galleries could invite a select number of clients; later in the fair, it sold his Multicolored Female Composition (2016) for $4.5 million. At the same fair, Sprüth Magers sold three Condos: two for $1.8 million each and one for $1.2 million. At Frieze London the week before, Hauser & Wirth sold his 2025 Head Composition sold for $200,000, while at Art Basel in Switzerland over the summer, the gallery sold two Condos for $2.45 million each.  \n\n\tIn addition to his market success, Condo also has institutional support. His is currently the subject of a major retrospective at the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, which opened just before Art Basel Paris and runs through February 2026. Previous surveys and solo exhibitions have been staged at National Museum Monaco (in 2023), the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. (2017), the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (2016), Tate Modern (2015), and the New Museum (2011).\n\n\tSprüth’s statement continued, “The major solo exhibition at the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, which just opened this month, is a testament to the breadth of his practice and to his prominent position in contemporary painting. It is a pleasure to be joining forces again with Per Skarstedt to represent George Condo at this exciting moment for the artist.”\n",

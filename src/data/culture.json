    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tFebruary 17th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe appear­ance of the Dead Sea Scrolls was the most impor­tant doc­u­ment dis­cov­ery of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry. Yet, in some sense, they did­n’t deliv­er what many assumed to be promised with­in: that is, the basis for a com­plete revi­sion of every­thing we thought we knew about Chris­tian­i­ty. The real­i­ty of the Dead Sea Scrolls’ con­tent is less sim­ple, but also stranger — which makes it an ide­al sub­ject for the YouTube chan­nel Hochela­ga, giv­en its pen­chant for explor­ing the obscure byways of reli­gious his­to­ry. And indeed, as host Tom­mie Trelawny says in his new video above, they are the “old­est Bib­li­cal writ­ings ever found,” a sta­tus that, what­ev­er their specifics, cer­tain­ly jus­ti­fies the great scruti­ny paid to them over the past eight decades.\nFor it was only in 1946 that the Scrolls were found, by a Bedouin shep­herd look­ing for his lost goat in a series of caves in the vicin­i­ty of ancient ruins by the Dead Sea. Or so the sto­ry goes, any­way, and Trelawny explains some of the com­pli­ca­tions that emerge when it’s exam­ined more close­ly.\nBut the fact remains that those caves did con­tain, tight­ly rolled up and for the most part well-pre­served, a set of scrolls adding up to “around 900 indi­vid­ual man­u­scripts: 40 per­cent of them “resem­bled books found in the Bible”; 30 per­cent, apoc­ryphal writ­ings “banned” from the Bible; and anoth­er 30 per­cent, “writ­ings pre­vi­ous­ly unknown to schol­ar­ship.” Those last include “texts that described a secre­tive reli­gious com­mu­ni­ty and apoc­a­lyp­tic visions of a great heav­en­ly war.”\nMost intrigu­ing­ly, there was also “a scroll made entire­ly of cop­per that lists the loca­tions of lost trea­sure.” None of it has ever been found, much as the con­tent of the oth­er texts has­n’t forced a great rethink­ing of the reli­gion at the cen­ter of so much of West­ern civ­i­liza­tion. In fact, as Bib­li­cal schol­ar Robert Alter writes in the Lon­don Review of Books, “the notion that these sec­tar­i­an writ­ings are actu­al­ly Chris­t­ian has no schol­ar­ly cred­i­bil­i­ty,” though some researchers argue that “the blue­print for the Gospel nar­ra­tives,” mes­si­ah fig­ure and all, “was laid out in the Scrolls and fol­lowed by the first Chris­t­ian writ­ers.” They do, how­ev­er, reveal a great deal about the world­view of the par­tic­u­lar fringe faith­ful who took to the desert to keep their unortho­dox beliefs safe from the harsh judg­ment of main­stream soci­ety — and, for about twen­ty cen­turies, safe they remained.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nGoogle Puts The Dead Sea Scrolls Online (in Super High Res­o­lu­tion)\nGoogle Dig­i­tizes Ancient Copies of the Ten Com­mand­ments and Gen­e­sis\n2,000-Year-Old Man­u­script of the Ten Com­mand­ments Gets Dig­i­tized: See/Download “Nash Papyrus” in High Res­o­lu­tion\nHow Ancient Scrolls, Charred by the Erup­tion of Mount Vesu­vius in 79 AD, Are Now Being Read by Par­ti­cle Accel­er­a­tors, 3D Mod­el­ing & Arti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence\nThe Gnos­tic Gospels: An Intro­duc­tion to the For­bid­den Teach­ings of Jesus\nIntro­duc­tion to the Old Tes­ta­ment: A Free Yale Course\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nApart from a few bridges that still work, the infra­struc­tur­al achieve­ments of the Roman Empire exist, for us, most­ly as ruins. With a lit­tle imag­i­na­tion, those his­toric sites give us a clear enough sense of the empire’s sheer might, but if we want to go deep­er, we should then look into the numer­ous Roman con­struc­tions that haven’t sur­vived at all. In the video below from his chan­nel Told in Stone, ancient-his­to­ry YouTu­ber Gar­rett Ryan gives his per­son­al top sev­en “lost Roman won­ders,” begin­ning with Trajan’s Bridge, whose length of more than a kilo­me­ter across the Danube made it the longest bridge ever built at that time: a project of ambi­tions befit­ting a man that his­to­ry remem­bers as one of the “Five Good Emper­ors.”\nNo such sta­tus for Nero, though he did com­mis­sion the Subi­a­co Dams. Nec­es­sary to cre­ate a series of arti­fi­cial lakes beneath the infa­mous ruler’s vil­la, they were the high­est dams in exis­tence until the Mid­dle Ages. Hadri­an’s more pub­lic-mind­ed white-mar­ble tem­ple at Cyz­i­cus in mod­ern-day Turkey was known as unusu­al­ly splen­did even by the stan­dards of that genre of build­ing; now only its foun­da­tions remain, with archae­o­log­i­cal digs turn­ing up the occa­sion­al frag­ment.\nIn the for­mer Con­stan­tino­ple, the Church of the Holy Apos­tles is remem­bered as the sec­ond-most famous van­ished ear­ly Chris­t­ian church, after only the old St. Peter’s Basil­i­ca in Rome. Hagia Sophia may still be around, but the Col­umn of Jus­tin­ian that once stood between it and the Great Palace was melt­ed down for scrap long ago.\n\n\n\t\n\nWe only know of these lost struc­tures because we have his­tor­i­cal attes­ta­tions of their exis­tence, most vivid­ly in paint­ings: take the Pyra­mid of Romu­lus, a strik­ing tomb that appears near the Vat­i­can in The Vision of the Cross, which Raphael’s assis­tants pro­duced after his death. Oth­ers, like the Colos­sus of Nero from which the Colos­se­um takes its name, are rep­re­sent­ed on coins. In the video at the top, Ryan cov­ers three more “for­got­ten Roman megapro­jects”: Claudius’ tun­nel of record-mak­ing length through the moun­tain between the Riv­er Liris and the Fucine Lake, Tra­jan’s mil­i­tary high­way through the “Iron Gates” of the Danube, and Octa­vian’s secret har­bor at Lake Aver­nus. In our time, of course, there are no more emper­ors, Roman or oth­er­wise, and we’re sure­ly bet­ter off for it. But we can still admire — to use a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry con­cept — the state capac­i­ty they com­mand­ed.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Genius Engi­neer­ing of Roman Aque­ducts\nThe Roman Colos­se­um Decon­struct­ed: 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals the Hid­den Tech­nol­o­gy That Pow­ered Rome’s Great Are­na\nThe Amaz­ing Engi­neer­ing of Roman Baths\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tFebruary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMad­man or vision­ary? A lit­tle of both? A genius? A brand? A men­sch? David Lynch was all these things and more, and this fan-made video above serves as a quick reminder of the career and the con­sis­ten­cy of the film director/artist/transcendental med­i­ta­tor who passed away last year.\nEar­ly in the video we see one of the director’s pub­lic­i­ty stunts, when he sat in a chair on the cor­ner of La Brea and Hol­ly­wood, next to a cow and a large poster of Lau­ra Dern. No, the cow had noth­ing to do with the film he was promoting—2006’s Inland Empire—but it did stop traf­fic and draw atten­tion. Lynch didn’t have an adver­tis­ing bud­get to pro­mote Lau­ra Dern’s lead role in the film, so the cow had to do.\nLau­ra Dern appeared in a major­i­ty of Lynch’s films begin­ning with 1986’s Blue Vel­vet, and the video hon­ors their friend­ship (he called her “Tid­bit”) as well as his col­lab­o­ra­tions with Kyle MacLach­lan (who Lynch called “Kale”) and Nao­mi Watts. All three obvi­ous­ly adored him.\nThere’s also a com­pi­la­tion of Lynch swear­ing like a champ. Prod­uct place­ment in film is “bull­shit,” prob­lems on set are “fuck­ing nuts,” and for those who sat through the “peanut sweep­ing” scene in Twin Peaks The Return, you’ll under­stand his out­burst on set: “Who gives a fuc&ing $hit how long a scene is?”\nWe’ve linked pre­vi­ous­ly to Lynch’s video where he makes quinoa, and this short edit sums up that video nice­ly. It’s also nice to see atten­tion giv­en to The Straight Sto­ry, which usu­al­ly gets passed over in his fil­mog­ra­phy, despite (or maybe because of) being his sweet­est movie.\nThere’s also a reminder that Lynch made videos from quar­an­tine in his Los Ange­les home. Not only did he deliv­er the dai­ly weath­er reports like he used to, but he also announced “Today’s Num­ber,” which caused quite a lot of anx­i­ety in the YouTube com­ments. (Why no sev­en? WHY NO NUMBER 7?)\nThe video ends with Lynch’s the­o­ry about catch­ing ideas like fish—we’ve also high­light­ed this before—and then a love­ly mon­tage of title cards, remind­ing us all that “Direct­ed by David Lynch” remains a guar­an­teed sign of qual­i­ty.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nTwin Peaks Actu­al­ly Explained: A 4‑Hour Video Essay Demys­ti­fies It All\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nDavid Lynch Made a Dis­turb­ing Web Sit­com Called “Rab­bits”: It’s Now Used by Psy­chol­o­gists to Induce a Sense of Exis­ten­tial Cri­sis in Research Sub­jects\nPat­ti Smith and David Lynch Talk About the Source of Their Ideas & Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n    \n                Art Review\n                After a stint in 1950s New York, the LA-based artist abandoned abstraction and painting in favor of dreamlike, sexually charged drawings. \n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            John Altoon, “Untitled (ABS-52)” (1965), airbrush, pastel, and ink on board (all images courtesy Franklin Parrasch Gallery)\n    \n        \n            I first saw John Altoon’s paintings in 1984 at the now-defunct Edward Thorp Gallery. Since then, I have learned as much about him as possible, by both looking at his work and talking with people who knew him — particularly the poet Robert Creeley, who collaborated with him on an artist’s book and portfolio titled About Women (1966), and the dealer Nicholas Wilder, who first exhibited his work in 1965. I have long wondered why Altoon, a brilliant and beloved maverick in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and ’60s, who died at age 43 in 1969, has generally flown under the radar outside of California. John Altoon: Drawings, a small, thoughtful exhibition at Franklin Parrasch Gallery, offered some clues. While he lived in New York in the early 1950s and was in contact with the Abstract Expressionists, he returned to LA and eventually abandoned abstraction and painting in favor of dreamlike, sexually charged drawings. On this path, Altoon rejected the formalist belief that drawing hindered the evolvement of modern art, which was prevalent at the time. He further set himself apart by flouting decorum and working from dreams and imagination. John Altoon, \"Untitled (F-39)\" (1966), pastel on paperThe exhibition’s seven works, all done between 1963 and ’68, speak to the range of Altoon’s drawing practice and use of diverse materials. There are the linear, feverish, sexual figure drawings done in ink and graphite that still cause consternation among some viewers and institutions (even museums with works by Hans Bellmer in their collection). The women in Altoon’s drawings are often larger than the men. They’re not vying for male attention, and often seem to be looking inward. The men, all seemingly uniform and undistinguished figures, come across as helpless dweebs. Altoon does not provide a context, which would help locate the drawing in the realm of the imagination. His frenetic line work, resulting in an image that is not immediately decipherable, makes us conscious of our looking — he confronts us with our voyeurism, anticipating the internet and private chatrooms. His infusion of humor into the erotic adds a note of absurdity to it all.In “Untitled (ABS-81A)” (1966), Altoon depicts, in dark violet, a form that looks like the bottom half of an ostrich floating on a mottled ground of faint blue and green circles. Three bulbous, tan-inflected plumes radiate from the central form while a square in the middle of it, which we read as a screen, shows a red, linear nude whose pose recalls Gustave Courbet’s infamous “Origin of the World” (1866) and Marcel Duchamp’s unsettling nude in “Étant donnés” (1946–66). Seeing this on what could be a bird’s backside sends a jolt of weird humor through the drawing. Are we to focus on the whole image or the nude? It’s a question also raised by Courbet and Duchamp.John Altoon, “Untitled (ABS-81A)” (1966), ink on boardAltoon composed the more abstract “Untitled (ABS-52)” (1965) using an airbrush, pastel, and ink. Four overlapping, amorphous shapes outlined in red and khaki green sit atop a sunburst composed of blue and yellow rays. In each of the outlined shapes, he drew something that is palpable but still remains beyond comprehension — an invented thing.When Altoon died, he was just coming into the height of his powers. He had mastered drawing and color, worked in different media, including pastel and airbrush, and developed a constantly morphing vocabulary. His openness to dreams and imagination made his work unpredictable (as in the drawing of an ostrich’s backside as the container for a screen). This is what drawing makes possible.

The camera created a distance rather than a connection; the intimacy wasn’t there. But in Miami, waist-deep in the Atlantic Ocean with their queer and trans friends, the opposite happens: Images arrive with ease. Bodies drift toward the lens without self-consciousness. Water softens everything. “The ocean is like church for us,” McCharen said. “It’s where we go to feel accepted, held, and whole.” The photos that emerge from these gatherings, depicting friends floating and laughing, form the raw material for Queer Atlantics, their newest body of work. On February 20, McCharen will host an evening at Green Space Miami as part of Women Photographers International Archive’s monthly Image Readings series, a community gathering where image-makers share and discuss works in progress. Two days later, the artist will present their first solo show at Dot Fiftyone Gallery, featuring works from the Queer Atlantics, on view until March 4.The event offers a rare chance to encounter the thinking behind McCharen’s newest body of work, a series of ocean-soaked photographs and quilts that transform Miami’s waters into a site of refuge, memory, and belonging.Artist Bex McCharen in December 2025 (photo Alexandra Martinez/Hyperallergic)Best known as the founder of Chromat, the body-inclusive fashion label now on hiatus, McCharen has spent the past several years shifting toward textile, cyanotype, and photography. In December, they debuted these works publicly in a solo presentation at Untitled Art Fair in partnership with Oolite Arts and Dot Fiftyone Gallery. The move into quilting marked a significant evolution, the language of swimwear and performance reconstituted into artworks that treat water as refuge in a moment when the state tries to legislate trans presence out of public life. From restrictions on gender-affirming care to attacks on drag and Pride, Florida’s recent legislative blitz has sought to render trans and queer people precarious, invisible, or gone.Bex McCharen, \"Aliyah in Bimini\" (2025) (image courtesy the artist)McCharen has lived in Miami for nearly a decade, after first arriving for Swim Week in 2013. What started as seasonal work became permanent once they fell in love with local queer and activist communities. The water, they said, changed them. “I went into the ocean as one person and came out another,” McCharen said.It became the site of their gender transition and the place where their closest community gathers in the face of political hostility. Quilting, for McCharen, is the medium that can hold that transformation. “Quilting is love and care and legacy,” McCharen explained. Bex McCharen, \"Floating into the Abyss on a boat of water diamonds\" (2025) (image courtesy the artist)It’s what swaddles infants; it’s what families pass down. They learned the craft from their mother, who learned from her mother, part of a long lineage of quilters in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. Recently, relatives began mailing McCharen unfinished quilt tops and scraps from decades-old projects. Those fabrics, already soft from handling, form part of this new work.But McCharen doesn’t see themselves as “modernizing” quilting. “I’m doing what people have done for centuries,” the artist said. When they’re unsure of a shape, they consult old quilting pattern books. One major piece in the Untitled presentation borrowed directly from a historic Mennonite design, but here, instead of calicoes and florals, the geometric structure holds cyanotypes of bodies underwater, digital prints of shoreline light, and the electric blues of Miami’s coastline. Quilting becomes a technology for preserving sensation: the drag of a wave across a back, the warmth of a friend pressed against your shoulder in the surf.In their Oolite studio, a draped textile of blue photo-strips slumps off the wall like a towel just shaken out after a swim. It feels like a small sanctuary. Most of the images in the work come from casual days spent in the ocean, rivers, and springs with queer friends. Many were shot with a small GoPro. “Photographing people is intimate,” McCharen said. “I have to feel comfortable with them, and they have to feel comfortable with me.” Bex McCharen, \"Being in the water\" (2025), cyanotype (image courtesy the artist)To translate these images into textile, McCharen creates negatives and prints cyanotypes on fabric, or uses Oolite Arts’ large-format printer to produce full-color panels. In “I am a river and my ancestral tributaries flow through me” (2025), a nude figure seems to dissolve into the water itself. Their limbs stretch across a field of deep blue. Hand-stitched lines radiate from the figure like veins emptying into an ocean. A long braid of beads and embroidery hangs down the quilt’s center, as if the river running through the body has breached the frame and continues its course into the world. It’s a quiet reminder, stitched into every seam, that we are all water.In these works, pleasure and joy act as a form of survival. Florida’s legislative climate remains openly hostile to trans life, but McCharen refuses the logic of exile. Laws shift, but the ocean stays open when institutional doors close.“Our relationship to the ocean is much deeper than whoever is in office,” McCharen said. “We’re not going to leave just because of whoever’s in power.” \n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Miami\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

But I do take notice when I feel like they’re communicating with me — and when they’re not. Wall texts aren’t just for listing who made an artwork; they’re one of the most direct ways that institutions can connect with visitors. So on those rare occasions when they speak to me clearly and graciously, without telling me what to think, but rather inviting me to ruminate on the art, I feel welcomed into the museum. In an illuminating essay below, art critic Aruna D’Souza reflects on what makes a good wall label and why getting them right is not just about the art — it’s about community, too.—Natalie Haddad, reviews editor\nHow much should museums care about their wall labels?

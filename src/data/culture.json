    "body": "\n\tin Life, Philosophy |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEach cul­ture has its own say­ings about the unique­ness and tran­sience of the present moment. In recent years, the Eng­lish-speak­ers have often found them­selves remind­ed, through the expres­sion “YOLO,” that they only live once. (The ques­tion of whether that should real­ly be “YLOO,” or “You Live Only Once,” we put aside for the time being.) In Japan, unsur­pris­ing­ly, one some­times hears a much more ven­er­a­ble equiv­a­lent: “ichi-go ichi‑e,” which some read­ers acquaint­ed with the Japan­ese lan­guage should be assured has noth­ing to do with straw­ber­ries, ichi­go. Rather, the say­ing’s under­ly­ing Chi­nese char­ac­ters (一期一会) can be trans­lat­ed as “one time, one meet­ing.”\nThe Bud­dhis­ti­cal­ly inflect­ed “ichi-go ichi‑e” is just one in the vast library of yoji­juku­go, high­ly con­densed apho­ris­tic expres­sions writ­ten with just four char­ac­ters. (Oth­er coun­tries with Chi­nese-influ­enced lan­guages have their ver­sions, includ­ing sajaseon­geo in Korea and chéngyǔ in Chi­na itself.) It descends, as the sto­ry goes, from a slight­ly longer say­ing favored by the six­teenth-cen­tu­ry tea mas­ter Sen no Rikyū, “ichi-go ni ichi-do” (一期に一度).\nOne must pay respects to the host of a tea cer­e­mo­ny because the meet­ing would only ever occur once — which, of course, it would, even if the cer­e­mo­ny was a reg­u­lar­ly sched­uled event. For we nev­er, to bor­row an ancient Greek take on this whole sub­ject, step into the same riv­er twice; no two events, sep­a­rat­ed in time, can ever tru­ly be iden­ti­cal.\n\n\n\t\n\nOne impli­ca­tion, as not­ed in the explana­to­ry videos above from the BBC and Einzel­gänger, is that we should savor what­ev­er moment we hap­pen to find our­selves in, how­ev­er imper­fect, because we won’t get a sec­ond chance to do so. And if it offers lit­tle or noth­ing to enjoy, we can find solace in the fact that its par­tic­u­lar dis­plea­sure, too, can nev­er revis­it us. With the past gone and the future nev­er guar­an­teed, the present moment, in any case, is the only time that actu­al­ly exists for us, so we’d bet­ter make our­selves com­fort­able with­in it. Though these ideas have per­haps found their most ele­gant and mem­o­rable expres­sion in Japan, they’re hard­ly con­sid­ered exclu­sive cul­tur­al prop­er­ty there.

    "body": "\n\tin Audio Books, Literature |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHav­ing not revis­it­ed The Hob­bit in some time, I’ve felt the famil­iar pull—shared by many readers—to return to Tolkien’s fairy-tale nov­el itself. It was my first expo­sure to Tolkien, and the per­fect book for a young read­er ready to dive into moral com­plex­i­ty and a ful­ly-real­ized fic­tion­al world.\nAnd what bet­ter guide could there be through The Hob­bit than Tolkien him­self, read­ing (above) from the 1937 work? In this 1952 record­ing in two parts (part 2 is below), the ven­er­a­ble fan­ta­sist and schol­ar reads from his own work for the first time on tape.\nTolkien begins with a pas­sage that first describes the crea­ture Gol­lum; lis­ten­ing to this descrip­tion again, I am struck by how much dif­fer­ent­ly I imag­ined him when I first read the book. The Gol­lum of The Hob­bit seems some­how hoari­er and more mon­strous than many lat­er visu­al inter­pre­ta­tions. This is a minor point and not a crit­i­cism, but per­haps a com­ment on how nec­es­sary it is to return to the source of a myth­ic world as rich as Tolkien’s, even, or espe­cial­ly, when it’s been so well-real­ized in oth­er media. No one, after all, knows Mid­dle Earth bet­ter than its cre­ator.\n\n\n\t\n\nThese read­ings were part of a much longer record­ing ses­sion, dur­ing which Tolkien also read (and sang!) exten­sive­ly from The Lord of the Rings. A YouTube user has col­lect­ed, in sev­er­al parts, a radio broad­cast of that full ses­sion, and it’s cer­tain­ly worth your time to lis­ten to it all the way through. It’s also worth know­ing the neat con­text of the record­ing. Here’s the text that accom­pa­nies the video on YouTube:\nWhen Tolkien vis­it­ed a friend in August of 1952 to retrieve a man­u­script of The Lord of the Rings, he was shown a “tape recorder”. Hav­ing nev­er seen one before, he asked how it worked and was then delight­ed to have his voice record­ed and hear him­self played back for the first time. His friend then asked him to read from The Hob­bit, and Tolkien did so in this one incred­i­ble take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2012.\nRelat­ed Con­tent\nLis­ten to J.R.R.

    "body": "\n\tThe British Museum is on a high-stakes hunt for hundreds of stolen artifacts, and it plans to hire a specialist to help track them down before they vanish for good.\n\n\tIn 2023, the museum revealed that thousands of items had gone missing from its Greek and Roman collections. Professor Tom Harrison, who was recently promoted to lead the department, has been leading the painstaking recovery of the treasures spanning gold jewellery, semi-precious stones, and glass dating back to the 15th century BC. Harrison told the Times that he hopes to reclaim the gold before it’s melted down, acknowledging that the search will likely continue “until I’m retired or under the ground.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tCurrently, a small team of five, already stretched with other museum duties, is tasked with the recovery. Harrison plans to recruit someone dedicated to “writing letters to dealers, auction houses, and collectors worldwide” once funding is secured. “We want to make progress fast,” he said.A museum spokesperson told ARTnews that the new role, which has not yet been advertised, will involve a good deal of archival research.\n\n\tThe scandal erupted when former curator Peter Higgs was sacked amid allegations of stealing, selling, and melting down artefacts over more than a decade. He denies the charges amid an ongoing civil case against him. The museum has so far recovered 654 of an estimated 1,500 missing items.\n\n\tRecovery is painstaking. Leads have been coming in from the public, but mostly the team’s own research into private sales, catalogues, and historical archives. Harrison noted that the quality of tips “varies enormously,” and increasingly the returns are modest, one or two objects at a time, though occasional windfalls, like 268 gems shipped from the US, offer hope.\n\n\tTechnology is playing a growing role in the search. Open-source investigations and AI-assisted image matching have helped track long-lost artifacts, while the museum ordered a full audit of the Greek and Roman collections to ensure that nothing else goes missing.Despite bureaucratic hurdles and the long wait for export licences, each recovered object has sparked flurries of joy, Harrison said. He recalled a moment of exhilaration when an item which has been  sold multiple times, even on eBay, since it went missing finally returns: “It’s good… a sense of real satisfaction, like bringing them home.”\n\n\tWins like that ensure that the team remains optimistic, especially for the gold. “It’s always assumed gold is stolen to be melted down. That is depressing, but there are little glimmers of hope we might find more of it,” Harrison said.\n",

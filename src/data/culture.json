    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tNovember 10th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs many as a mil­lion peo­ple crossed the Gold­en Gate Bridge on foot to cel­e­brate the 50th anniver­sary of its con­struc­tion in 1987. More than a few of them would have remem­bered San Fran­cis­co as it was before it had its most icon­ic struc­ture — and indeed, some would even remem­ber walk­ing across it once before, on its inau­gur­al “Pedes­tri­an Day” in 1937. Bar­ring the pos­si­bil­i­ty of unusu­al­ly vig­or­ous super­cente­nar­i­ans, that won’t be the case eight years from now, on the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s 100th anniver­sary. But we’ll still be able to appre­ci­ate the enor­mous ambi­tion of its builders, not least its chief design engi­neer Joseph Strauss, who, along with Charles Alton Ellis, made pos­si­ble a project long assumed impos­si­ble.\nThe video from Sabin Civ­il Engi­neer­ing at the top of the post explains every stage of the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s design and con­struc­tion. Build­ing a sus­pen­sion bridge over the Gold­en Gate, the deep strait between San Fran­cis­co Bay and the Pacif­ic Ocean, posed for­mi­da­ble chal­lenges. The dis­tinc­tive shape we know from so many pho­tographs emerged in part from the need to anchor the bridge in such a way as to bal­ance out the mas­sive forces that would oth­er­wise bend its tow­ers inward, and the steel-on-steel con­struc­tion of its sus­penders and deck was nec­es­sary to pre­vent cat­a­stroph­ic crack for­ma­tion.\nThe deck hangs from 250 pairs of cables, and each of the main cables that run the length of the bridge actu­al­ly con­sists of 27,000 steel wires wound togeth­er. A sys­tem of ther­mal expan­sion joints accom­mo­dates reg­u­lar elon­ga­tion and shrink­age of near­ly four feet.\n\n\n\t\n\nAnd we haven’t even got into the under­wa­ter blast­ing and ter­ri­fy­ing-look­ing drilling work required to put up the tow­ers in the first place. In any case, the painstak­ing efforts of the engi­neers and labor­ers alike have sure­ly been vin­di­cat­ed by the Gold­en Gate Bridge’s func­tion­al­i­ty and pop­u­lar­i­ty over the past 88 years. Nat­u­ral­ly, it’s had to under­go con­sid­er­able main­te­nance and retro­fitting in that time, and it would take a true roman­tic to ignore its lim­i­ta­tions entire­ly. (Take its lack of rail capac­i­ty, which was nei­ther tech­ni­cal­ly nor eco­nom­i­cal­ly fea­si­ble to incor­po­rate dur­ing the Great Depres­sion.) Still, when 300,000 peo­ple jammed them­selves onto its deck at once on its 50th anniver­sary, it may have bent in the mid­dle, but it did­n’t break. That was a tes­ta­ment to the civ­il engi­neer­ing acu­men of Strauss and com­pa­ny — but let’s hope the cen­te­nary fes­tiv­i­ties are bet­ter orga­nized.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n“The Bay Lights,” the World’s Largest LED Light Sculp­ture, Debuts in San Fran­cis­co\nThe 5 Inno­v­a­tive Bridges That Make New York City, New York City\nHow the Brook­lyn Bridge Was Built: The Sto­ry of One of the Great­est Engi­neer­ing Feats in His­to­ry\nA Mes­mer­iz­ing Trip Across the Brook­lyn Bridge: Watch Footage from 1899\nWhy There Isn’t a Bridge from Italy to Sici­ly – And Why the 2,000-Year-Old Dream of Build­ing the Bridge May Soon Be Real­ized\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art |   \tNovember 10th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nIn addi­tion to the icon­ic scene in Jim Henson’s Labyrinth, or appear­ances in ani­mat­ed TV shows and video games, M.C. Esch­er’s work has adorned the cov­ers of albums like Mott the Hoople’s 1969 debut and the spec­u­la­tive fic­tion of Ita­lo Calvi­no and Jorge Luis Borges. A big hit with hip­pies and 1960s col­lege stu­dents, writes Heavy Music Art­work, his mind-bend­ing prints became asso­ci­at­ed with “ques­tion­ing accept­ed views of nor­mal expe­ri­ence and test­ing the lim­its of per­cep­tion with hal­lu­cino­genic drugs.” While he appre­ci­at­ed his cult fol­low­ing, Esch­er “did not encour­age their mys­ti­cal inter­pre­ta­tions of his images.” Reply­ing to one enthu­si­as­tic fan of his print Rep­tiles, who claimed to see in it an image of rein­car­na­tion, Esch­er replied, “Madame, if that’s the way you see it, so be it.”\n\nRather than illus­trate high­er states of con­scious­ness or meta­phys­i­cal enti­ties, Bruno Ernst writes in The Mag­ic Mir­ror of M.C. Esch­er, the artist intend­ed to cre­ate prac­ti­cal, “pic­to­r­i­al rep­re­sen­ta­tion of intel­lec­tu­al under­stand­ing.” Illus­tra­tions, that is, of philo­soph­i­cal and sci­en­tif­ic thought exper­i­ments. The son of a civ­il engi­neer, Esch­er began his stud­ies in archi­tec­ture before mov­ing to draw­ing and print­mak­ing.\nThe chal­lenge of cre­at­ing built environments—even seem­ing­ly impos­si­ble ones—always seemed to occu­py his mind. Along with themes from the nat­ur­al world, a high per­cent­age of his works cen­ter on buildings—inspired by for­ma­tive ear­ly years in Rome and his admi­ra­tion for Islam­ic art and Span­ish archi­tec­ture.\n\nIn the 50s and 60s Escher’s art piqued the inter­est of aca­d­e­mics and math­e­mati­cians, an audi­ence he found more con­ge­nial to his vision. He cor­re­spond­ed with sci­en­tists and incor­po­rat­ed their ideas into his work, mean­while claim­ing to be “absolute­ly inno­cent of train­ing or knowl­edge in the exact sci­ences.” In the 50s, Esch­er “daz­zled” the likes of math­e­mati­cians like Roger Pen­rose and HSM Cox­eter. In turn, notes Maev Kennedy, he “was inspired by Penrose’s per­spec­ti­val tri­an­gle and Coxeter’s work on crys­tal sym­me­try.”\n\nFor all the excite­ment he cre­at­ed among math­e­mati­cians, it took a bit longer for Esch­er to get noticed in the art world. When Penrose’s uncle showed Escher’s ver­sion of the per­spec­ti­val tri­an­gle to Picas­so, “Picas­so had heard of the British math­e­mati­cian but not of the Dutch artist.” Escher’s fame spread out­side of the sci­ences in part through the inter­ests of the coun­ter­cul­ture. He may have shrugged off mys­ti­cal and psy­che­del­ic read­ings of his prints, but he had an innate pen­chant for the mar­velous­ly weird (see his copy of a scene, for exam­ple, from Hierony­mus Bosch, above, or his sur­re­al print Grav­i­ty, below).\n\nSee the prints pic­tured here and a few dozen more dig­i­tized in high res­o­lu­tion at Dig­i­tal Com­mon­wealth, cour­tesy of Boston Pub­lic Library, who scanned their Esch­er col­lec­tion and made it avail­able to the pub­lic. Zoom into the fine details of prints like Inside Saint Peter’s, fur­ther up—a fine­ly ren­dered but oth­er­wise not-espe­cial­ly-Esch­er-like work—and the labyrinthine Ascend­ing and Descend­ing at the top. Whether—as Har­vard Library cura­tor John Over­holt confesses—you’re a “nerd who loves M.C. Esch­er” for his math­e­mat­i­cal mind, an artist with a mys­ti­cal bent who loves him for his hal­lu­ci­na­to­ry qual­i­ties, or some mea­sure of both, you’ll find exact­ly the Esch­er you’re look­ing for in this dig­i­tal gallery.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2018.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEnter an Online Inter­ac­tive Doc­u­men­tary on M.C.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for her perplexing compositions of domestic interiors, Cinta Vidal continues to mesmerize with a new body of paintings at Thinkspace Projects. The artist’s solo show, Inward, continues her exploration of what she describes as “un-gravity constructions,” in which space and time appear folded or warped.\nIn Vidal’s dizzying compositions, people occupy different areas of invented apartments and homes. Perhaps each tableau represents a different period of time; perhaps they are parallel universes. “For Vidal, depicting macro and micro levels of inverted apartment buildings and city structures illustrates the various ways the world is experienced by a mass population,” the gallery says.\n“Flat” (2025), acrylic on wood, 31.5 x 31.5 inches\n“The word ‘inward’ speaks to both layers of interiority: the shared indoor spaces we inhabit and the private, inward-facing state we enter when we disconnect from what surrounds us,” Vidal says. A sofa, for example, can be a place of togetherness or quiet retreat. “These scenes reflect that subtle coexistence: being together, yet each within their own space,” she adds.\nInward continues through November 29 in Los Angeles. And as a complement to the exhibition, Vidal painted a new mural on the side of a local frame shop called Sherman Gallery in Marina del Rey.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 2016, a high school student in Charlottesville, Virginia, launched a petition to remove a number of statues from public view. These included Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, Thomas Jefferson, and others, a majority of which a businessman named Paul Goodloe McIntire commissioned in the early 20th century. Over time, these monuments were seen as glorifications of men who furthered Manifest Destiny and condoned slavery, and they continued as emblems of white supremacy.\nWhen the Charlottesville city council approved removing some statues, counterprotestors filed a lawsuit to keep them. And in 2017, during a Unite the Right rally, tensions grew deadly when a man accelerated his vehicle into a group of people, killing one and injuring dozens. The tragedy was an inflection point, but the statues remained until the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, spurred by George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, again amplified the conflict on a national scale.\n\nIn July 2021, 100 years after its initial unveiling, Charlottesville removed the sculptures of Lee and Jackson. The former was melted down, and the latter was deeded to artist Kara Walker by way of a Los Angeles nonprofit called The Brick. It’s here, as part of the exhibition MONUMENTS, that Walker has boldly re-envisioned the statue as a potent symbol of transformation.\nWalker is known for making work, often on a large scale, that engages with symbols and stereotypes of racism. Her monumental piece “A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby,” installed in a former Domino sugar factory in Brooklyn in 2014, comprised a giant sculpture of a woman-sphinx. \nWith a kerchief evocative of Aunt Jemima, viewers were face-to-face with an architectonic, stereotypically racist interpretation of Southern Black women, especially the notion of the “mammy,” a loyal servant. Walker turned the tables on this image, monumentalizing her into not only a giant decorative confection but also a deity.\nFor the piece at The Brick, Walker similarly transfigures a symbol of oppression into a compelling, retributive, enigmatic form. “At 13 feet high and 16 feet long, the bronze statue portrayed Jackson spurring his steed, ‘Little Sorrel,’ into the heat of battle,” says a statement.\n\nThe reimagined statue, “Unmanned Drone,” dissects the original sculpture created by artist Charles Keck into an unsettling, Hieronymus Bosch-like composition. “Altered beyond recognition, it is, however, still horse and rider,” the gallery says. “Instead of charging into battle, Walker’s headless horseman wanders in Civil War purgatory, dragging its sword over a ruined battlefield.”\nThe Brick is curated by Hamza Walker—no relation to Kara—who has been collecting decommissioned Confederate monuments from cities around the U.S. Today, the statue of Jackson takes an entirely new form, recontextualized in a way that spins the power to harm into the power to heal. Taken apart limb by limb and reconstructed into a surreal, fragmented, spectral reflection on how the past is woven into the present, Walker contends with the relationship between history and legend.\nThe title, “Unmanned Drone,” refers simultaneously to aircraft controlled remotely and a kind of low, humming, almost physical sound. The artist is interested in the way that, like a device flying overhead or a deep, reverberating sound, the sculpture also “presses on you…it looms.”\nIn an interview with Hamza Walker, Kara describes the impetus for memorial statues as rooted in myth. These sculptures are “all about these sometimes misapplied desires—a desire for heroism in a time of poverty and abysmal lack of faith,” she says. “I wanted to deal with the material in a way that was also about the act of separation—separating man from horse and man from myth.”\nMONUMENTS is a major group exhibition running concurrently at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA and The Brick, which pairs decommissioned historical monuments with contemporary artists as a response to the layered and living histories post-Civil War. The show continues in Los Angeles through May 3.\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAli Eyal, \"And Look Where I Went\" (2025), oil on linen (all photos Alex Paik/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nLOS ANGELES — The seventh iteration of Made in L.A., the Hammer Museum’s biennial exhibition showcasing artists working in the greater Los Angeles area, contains few surprises. The curators’ self described “no-methodology methodology” results in a scattered exhibition that feels bland and curatorially unimaginative. \nDespite this, the show contains some strong work, especially in cases where the artists have been given their own rooms — for example, Hannah Hur’s gorgeous five-panel installation “Suspension” (2025), installed in a vault-like gallery. Each painted panel consists of a grid of faint white lines dotted with white flower-like patterns. The interaction between the grid and the flower motif creates a sense of spatial confusion when viewing the work. This effect is only enhanced by the room’s architecture: The lines in the cement floor and the curved shadows cast from a panel, which appears to be floating in midair, become a vital part of the viewing experience. Hur’s quiet work transforms one’s perception of both the viewer’s physical space and the spaces she creates within each painting.\nInstallation view of Hanna Hur, “Suspension” (2025), acrylic, colored pencil, Flashe, and pigment on canvas\nNa Mira disorients histories and mythologies in “Sugungga (Hello)” (2025).” The work references a Korean allegory in which a sick dragon king trying to cure itself lures and is subsequently tricked by a rabbit. Two videos are projected onto opposite sides of a holographic glass — one filmed in a cab driving around the outside perimeter of a walled former military building, constructed by the Japanese army and later used as a US military base, and the other showing an inflatable rabbit sculpture inside of the grounds. These projections collapse inside and outside. They cast ghostly moving shadows and distorted imagery around the room and onto other viewers. The story of Korea’s occupiers is literally embodied by this one building, and the work’s confusing boundaries cast the viewer as both victim and complicit co-conspirator, as both inside and outside systems of power.\nAnother standout is an assemblage by Gabriela Ruiz comprised of cartoonishly painted screaming faces, a surveillance camera that displays the viewer on a screen, and an LED streetlamp. This piece perfectly embodies our fraught relationship with technology, wherein we willingly allow ourselves to be surveilled by social media platforms under the guise of connecting with others. These platforms have also manipulated and damaged our thought patterns, siloing us into our own personalized echo chambers and flattening commerce, memes, life milestones, and horrifying news clips into a single bland stream of content vying for our attention.

Across her career, she has inhabited a succession of roles — museum specimen, interrogator, colonial queen, subaltern laborer — to expose the systems that produce them. Her works, whether filmed, staged, or photographed, return to that charged encounter so that what began as performances about being looked at has evolved into frameworks for looking back: at surveillance, at the museum’s apparatus of display, at the camera’s complicity, at the viewer’s own position within it. Fusco’s first United States retrospective, Tomorrow I Will Become an Island at El Museo del Barrio, traces this evolving choreography of perception.\nThe show is divided into four loosely thematic sections titled “Migration,” “Cultural Encounter,” “Interrogation,” and “Poetry and Power.” In “Els Segadors” (2023), part of the first section, a diverse grouping of Catalans recites the centuries-old anthem of independence — banned during Francisco Franco’s dictatorship in the mid-20th century and later revived as a symbol of sovereignty — reflecting on what the song now means to them. Filmed in a single, frontal frame and intercut with candid exchanges between Fusco and her participants, the work lets the performance slowly fray: pride gives way to hesitation, patriotism to unease, until talk of belonging turns to acknowledgements of exclusion. Voices slip between Catalan and Spanish, color alternates with grayscale, and the anthem mutates through salsa, folk, and rap. Each shift introduces a hybridity that unsettles a fixed sense of Catalan identity; each slippage loosens the seams of the nationalist script it supposedly restages.\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La Plaza Vacía (The Empty Plaza)” (2012), HD Video, 11:53 min\n“Els Segadors” unfolds from a script that gradually breaks open, a form that applies to much of her work, including her photographs. Rounding out the same gallery, for instance, is a continuous band of black and white portraits depicting immigrants, friends, and strangers alike, posed against urban and domestic backdrops. Taken over the past year — a period shadowed by immigration raids — “Everyone Who Lives Here Is a New Yorker” (2025) initially reads as a set of informal yet intimate portraits. Only when we cross the room to encounter Augustus Frederick Sherman and Lewis Hine’s early-20th-century photographs of immigrants, hung in a grid, does it become clear that Fusco has staged her sitters to mirror the archival compositions. The people in “Venezuelan family in Queens” sit in a neat alignment echoing Sherman’s “English Family at Ellis Island” (undated), while the beaming subjects in “Ecuadorian child vendors” holding bouquets reanimate Hine’s “Child Vendors, Bowery, 1910,” their smiles lending warmth to an iconic image once used to spur legislation around child labor. Notably, though her photographs are explicit citations of immigrant portraiture, they position people not by the conditions of their arrival but in the particular ways they belong to New York.\nThat studied quality defines much of the retrospective. Fusco’s performances often borrow from institutional procedures: She recreates military drills in “A Room of One’s Own: Women and Power in the New America” (2006–08) and enrolls in an immersive simulation and workshop on military interrogation in “Operation Atropos” (2006), dissecting the grammar of disciplinary systems. Her videos carry the same investigative and elegiac impulse. Works such as “La confesión” and “La Plaza vacía” (both 2012) consider Cuban national memory, splicing found footage, oral histories, historical documents, partial testimonies, and Fusco’s measured voice-over to trace the afterlives of the Cuban revolution. Watching the hours of accumulated testimony and archival fragments feels like joining her in the act of sifting. She speaks with the cadence of a reporter — methodical, informed, occasionally weary. Her editing, however, reveals an equally strong pull toward metaphor: Long takes of the deserted Plaza de la Revolución watched over by the monumental steel portraits of Castro and Che Guevara alternate with archival footage of military spectacle, the vacant square and its flattened icons mirroring the hollowed-out ideals of the revolution itself.\n\nDetail of Coco Fusco, “Everyone Who Lives Here is a New Yorker” (2025), 12 sets of pigment prints\nPart of the “Cultural Encounter” section is a room that revisits Fusco’s earliest and most overt acts of institutional critique. “Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit The West” (1992–94), made with Guillermo Gómez-Peña, is represented through photo documentation and a reconstruction of the original cage. It satirizes the enclosures once used to display Indigenous peoples at world’s fairs and museums, a practice that continued well into the 20th century, as a timeline on the wall makes clear. The artists — dressed in hand-sewn grass skirts, leather wristbands, and red face paint or masks — pose as “undiscovered natives,” staging an ethnographic fantasy of “discovery” and display. The cage’s mix of props — a Kahlúa Tiki decanter on a European-capitals tablecloth beside a Mickey Mouse rug and TV — collapses distinctions between “authentic” cultural emblem and mass-produced commodity. The effect underscores the manufactured nature of such “human zoo” displays as spectacles of staged authenticity — a dynamic that, Fusco and Gómez-Peña imply, museums risk repeating when they package non-Western cultures for display.\nIn this new installation, the cage has been restaged with its door open so that visitors can step inside and watch a documentary on the original performance playing on a small television within. The gesture shifts the work’s meaning: Rather than observing the ethnographic gaze from a distance, viewers are invited to experience what it feels like to inhabit its frame. Nearby, a wall text quotes a song by Los Tigres del Norte: “Even if the cage is made of gold, it is still a prison,” a line that echoes Fusco’s own skepticism about the art world’s liberal pieties. The cage, in this sense, stands for the structure of representation itself — one that offers visibility while preserving established hierarchies.\n\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West” (1992/2025), multimedia installation\nStill, the question remains: What exactly do we expect from critique now? To see this piece here in El Museo is to face a quiet symmetry between an artist who once staged marginalization as spectacle and a museum born from the Puerto Rican community organizing against such exclusion. Nearby archival materials from the 1997 work “La Chavela Realty Company” seem to address such frictions directly. They show Fusco dressed as Queen Isabel la Católica, the 15th-century monarch who financed Columbus’s voyage, offering parcels of the New World for sale at a dollar apiece. Among the “buyers” is El Museo del Barrio’s former director, whose signed deed now hangs beside photographic documentation and a campy golden gown with ship-shaped headdress designed by artist Pepón Osorio. Printed over a map and written in irreverent Spanglish, the deed is both grandiose and absurd. Presented here, the joke becomes self-referential, a correspondence between artist and institution. It leaves open a question of position — what kind of critical distance is still possible from the inside? Is maintaining proximity to institutions the only viable mode of holding power accountable?\nOne of the concluding works, “Your Eyes Will Be an Empty Word” (2021), offers something like an answer. In it, Fusco rows around Hart Island — the largest mass grave in the United States, where formerly enslaved and unhoused people and victims of epidemics such as COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS are buried — reciting a verse by Cuban poet Dulce María Loynaz about isolation and endurance. The camera drifts steadily, oars cutting through deep blue water, while violins draw out mournful, long-held notes. The allegorical image clarifies Fusco’s political stance as well as circles back to the exhibition’s title. To “become an island” is to maintain autonomy within systems that consume difference, to stay apart without retreating. Across three decades, Fusco has traced what happens when ideology isolates, when nations and individuals retreat behind physical and political borders. Yet the exhibition suggests that to “become an island” may also be to claim autonomy, to inhabit the structures of power without surrendering to them.\n\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La Chavela Realty Company” (1991) (left) and performance documentation of “La Chavela Realty Company” (1991) (right)\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Your Eyes Will Be an Empty Word” (2021)\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West” (1992/2025), multimedia installation\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La confesión (The Confession)” (2015), HD Video, 33:06 minutes\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “La Chavela Realty Company” (1991) \nInstallation view of photos by Augustus Frederick Sherman and Lewis Hine \nInstallation view of Coco Fusco: Tomorrow, I Will Become an Island\nInstallation view of Coco Fusco, “Els Segadors (The Reapers)” (2001), video, 22 min\nCoco Fusco: Tomorrow, I Will Become an Island continues at El Museo del Barrio (1230 5th Avenue, East Harlem, New York) through January 11, 2026.

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Life, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen the his­to­ry books are writ­ten, we’ll remem­ber the politi­cians, law firms, and CEOs who quick­ly bent the knee to Don­ald Trump. We’ll also remem­ber the scant few Amer­i­can fig­ures who refused to back down. Bruce Spring­steen will be high on that short list.\nTour­ing in Europe last sum­mer, Spring­steen warned his audi­ence: “The Amer­i­ca that I love, the Amer­i­ca I have writ­ten about, that has been a bea­con of hope and lib­er­ty for 250 years, is cur­rent­ly in the hands of a cor­rupt, incom­pe­tent and trea­so­nous admin­is­tra­tion.” Those words seem par­tic­u­lar­ly pre­scient giv­en the chaos and vio­lence now unfold­ing in Min­neso­ta.\nFol­low­ing the shoot­ings of Renee Good and Alex Pret­ti, Spring­steen made his voice heard again—this time through music. Last week, he released the protest song “Streets of Min­neapo­lis” and soon after­ward trav­eled to Min­neso­ta to per­form the song live at a ben­e­fit con­cert arranged by Tom Morel­lo. Speak­ing to the crowd, Spring­steen said, “I wrote Streets of Min­neapo­lis and record­ed it the next day.” When he won­dered if the song sound­ed too ‘soap­boxy,’ he turned to Morel­lo, and the Rage Against the Machine gui­tarist replied, “Bruce, nuance is won­der­ful, but some­times you need to kick them in the teeth.” We’ll say amen to that.\nAfter “Streets of Min­neapo­lis,” Spring­steen and Morel­lo per­formed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” Watch it above. The start of the show began with “Killing In The Name Of.” Catch it below.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\nScott Gal­loway Unveils “Resist and Unsub­scribe,” an Action Plan for Con­sumers to Push Back Against Gov­ern­ment Over­reach\nTom Morel­lo Responds to Angry Fans Who Sud­den­ly Real­ize That Rage Against the Machine’s Music Is Polit­i­cal: “What Music of Mine DIDN’T Con­tain Polit­i­cal BS?”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Economics |   \tFebruary 1st, 2026  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs men­tioned here last week, Scott Gal­loway argued that Amer­i­cans have one way to reverse the vio­lent over­reach of the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment: launch a one-month eco­nom­ic strike aimed at major tech and AI com­pa­nies, with the goal of reduc­ing Amer­i­ca’s GDP and mak­ing the mar­kets wob­ble. When the mar­kets gyrat­ed after “Lib­er­a­tion Day,” Pres­i­dent Trump imme­di­ate­ly rolled back many tar­iffs. Now, if Amer­i­cans can flex their eco­nom­ic mus­cles in Feb­ru­ary, Gal­loway wagers the admin­is­tra­tion will rethink whether it wants to keep arrest­ing jour­nal­ists and let­ting masked ICE agents shoot civil­ians in the streets—with impuni­ty.\nToday, Gal­loway has launched a new web­site, Resist and Unsub­scribe, that pro­vides an action plan for a month­long strike. In the “Ground Zero” sec­tion of the site, Gal­loway lists sub­scrip­tion ser­vices from America’s largest tech­nol­o­gy companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple, Net­flix, Ope­nAI, and Microsoft—and pro­vides links that let users unsub­scribe quick­ly. He also sug­gests hold­ing off on buy­ing new hard­ware and prod­ucts from these com­pa­nies (e.g. iPhones). If you use Feb­ru­ary to review your sub­scrip­tions and find ones to cut, you’ll clean up your per­son­al finances. You’ll also get the atten­tion of the major tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies that account for one-third of the S&P 500. When the tech CEOs get “yip­py,” so too will Trump.\nIn the “Blast Zone” sec­tion of Resist and Unsub­scribe, Gal­loway lists consumer‑facing com­pa­nies he has “iden­ti­fied as active enablers of ICE,” nam­ing AT&T, Com­cast, Lowe’s, Mar­riott, and Spo­ti­fy among oth­ers. He explains how these com­pa­nies sup­port ICE and rec­om­mends spe­cif­ic ser­vices you can can­cel or avoid. Scroll down the page to see these sug­ges­tions.\nVis­it Resist and Unsub­scribe, find some ser­vices to can­cel (it’s not a large sac­ri­fice), and spread the word. You can also find more infor­ma­tion about the Resist and Unsub­scribe move­ment on Gal­loway’s blog, “No Mercy/No Mal­ice.”\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nScott Gal­loway Explains How YOU Can Stop Gov­ern­ment Over­reach Using the Pow­er of Your Purse\nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough his movies may have ben­e­fit­ed great­ly from for­eign audi­ences and back­ers, David Lynch was one of the most thor­ough­ly Amer­i­can of all film­mak­ers. “Born Mis­soula, MT,” declared his Twit­ter bio, yet one nev­er real­ly asso­ciates him with a par­tic­u­lar place in the Unit­ed States (at least no extant one). From Mon­tana, the Lynch fam­i­ly moved to Ida­ho, then Wash­ing­ton, then North Car­oli­na, then Vir­ginia. The tim­ing of that last stint proved cul­tur­al­ly for­tu­itous indeed: liv­ing in the city of Alexan­dria, the eigh­teen-year-old Lynch was close enough to the nation’s cap­i­tal to attend the very first con­cert the Bea­t­les played in North Amer­i­ca, at the Wash­ing­ton Col­i­se­um on Feb­ru­ary 11, 1964.\n“I was into rock and roll music, main­ly Elvis Pres­ley.” Lynch recalls this unsur­pris­ing fact in the clip above (which would have been among the last inter­views he gave before his death a year ago) from Bea­t­les ’64, the Mar­tin Scors­ese-pro­duced doc­u­men­tary on the Fab Four’s first U.S. tour.\n“I didn’t have any idea how big this event was. And it was in a gigan­tic place where they had box­ing match­es. The Bea­t­les were in the box­ing ring. It was so loud, you can’t believe. Girls shud­der­ing, cry­ing, scream­ing their heart out. It was phe­nom­e­nal.” That deaf­en­ing crowd noise fig­ures into most every account of the group’s Beat­le­ma­nia-era shows — and played a deci­sive role in their per­ma­nent retreat into the stu­dio a cou­ple of years lat­er.\nLynch sure­ly would have under­stood the desire for artis­tic explo­ration and con­trol that drove the Bea­t­les’ con­cen­tra­tion on mak­ing records. Even the sen­si­bil­i­ties of his work and theirs had some­thing in com­mon, exhibit­ing as they both did the unlike­ly com­bi­na­tion of pop­u­lar­i­ty and exper­i­men­ta­tion.  Some­how, David Lynch’s films and the Bea­t­les’ albums could ven­ture into bewil­der­ing obscu­ri­ty and sen­ti­men­tal kitsch with­out los­ing coher­ence or crit­i­cal respect. And dare one imag­ine that the expe­ri­ence of wit­ness­ing the Amer­i­can debut of what would become the most influ­en­tial rock band of all time has giv­en Lynch his appre­ci­a­tion — evi­dent in his movies, but also his own record­ings — for the pow­er of music, which he calls “one of the most fan­tas­tic things”? Even if not, it must have been, well… sur­re­al.\n\n\n\t\n\nvia Wel­come to Twin Peaks\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nAnge­lo Badala­men­ti Reveals How He and David Lynch Com­posed the Twin Peaks’ “Love Theme”\nWhen the Bea­t­les Refused to Play Before Seg­re­gat­ed Audi­ences on Their First U.S. Tour (1964)\nDavid Lynch Directs a New Music Video for Dono­van\nWatch the Bea­t­les Per­form Their Famous Rooftop Con­cert: It Hap­pened 50 Years Ago Today (Jan­u­ary 30, 1969)\nDavid Lynch Talks Med­i­ta­tion with Paul McCart­ney\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOn a promontory in eastern Portugal overlooking the Hispano-Portuguese plateau and the gorges of the Rio Erges, a spherical installation sits amid brush and old stone walls. A project of Paris-based studio Atelier Yokyok, “Ninho Globo” is made of a local black rock called schist. The material lends a dramatic effect in contrast to the sky and the windswept area of Salvaterra do Extremo, a town nestled in this rocky area bordering Spain.\nAtelier Yokyok is a four-person design studio founded by architects Samson Lacoste and Luc Pinsard and joined by Laure Qaremy and Pauline Lazareff. Evocative of Andy Goldworthy’s slate interventions in the form of portals and cones, “Ninho Globo” evokes a nest, a planet, or a giant seed pod tumbling through the landscape. Its title translates from Portuguese to mean “globe nest,” and its stark, otherworldly beauty challenges how we think about places of comfort and safety.\n\n“Ninho Globo” inhabits a former pig farm, where numerous walled pens known as furdas have been constructed from dry stone on a natural granite base. “It creates a small landscape strongly shaped by human intervention and endowed with heritage and archaeological significance,” says a statement. The installation invites visitors to step inside and pause, meditate on material and the surrounding environment, or simply get out of the wind.\nAtelier Yokyok chose a sphere to evoke celestial bodies and “an awareness of the planet as a shared place,” the team says. “It recalls its mineral origins…It embodies both stability and potential movement, gravity and balance. It conveys a sense of permanence, while engaging the body of those who experience it in a physical and spatial relationship.”\nThe pavilion is bisected by a deep, jagged space that the studio refers to as “The Canyon,” mirroring its rugged surroundings and creating a unique tension between its function as a shelter. Its goal is open-ended. “Is it a nest or a planet?…Can it be used? It challenges our relationship to the common good: how can it be used responsibly so that it endures? Who will come after us?”\nSee more on Atelier Yokyok’s Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDecades before the advent of photography, when European scientists and explorers were undertaking global expeditions and collecting flora and fauna from around the world, art and science converged in fields of medicine, anthropology, and natural history. During the Enlightenment, artists like Elizabeth Blackwell, John Gould, and Elizabeth Gould—among many, many others—documented botanicals, avians, insects, marine species, and more, many of which were published in hefty volumes and archived in museum collections.\nSarah Stone (1759-1844) was a British illustrator and the daughter of a fan painter, whose rich depictions of birds and artifacts highlight a singular talent during an era when women weren’t even permitted to be members of London’s prestigious Royal Academy. Nevertheless, she was invited to exhibit four drawings as an “Honorary Exhibitor” when she was 21.\nGoldfinch (Carduelis carduelis)\nIn the 1770s, British businessman and collector Sir Ashton Lever commissioned Stone to paint items in his museum chock-full of natural and ethnographic objects he called the Holophusikon, also known as the Lever Museum. Stone painted objects at Lever’s Holophusikon well into the 1780s, creating a visual chronicle of objects and fauna acquired from all over the world.\nAristocratic private museums were a phenomenon of the Enlightenment, when Britain enjoyed wealth, prestige, and influence, much of which was derived from other parts of the empire and the transatlantic slave trade. Many of today’s institutions, such as the British Museum, began with individuals’ private collections.\nNearly two dozen of the artist’s paintings are currently on view in Sarah Stone’s Unseen World: A Rare Collection of 18th Century Ornithological Watercolours as part of the Master Drawings New York art fair. Surveying a wide range of incredible birds, from the Bornean peacock pheasant to the distinctive orange-and-black rufous treepie.\nThe exhibition shares its title with a book co-authored by Errol Fuller and art dealer Craig Finch of Finch & Co., which presents the paintings this month. “Like many women painters of her time, Stone produced exquisite watercolour landscapes,” says a statement. “However, she was exceptional in her commercial success, with her paintings sought after by connoisseurs and collectors. In an era when women’s contributions were often overlooked, Stone defied the norm and stood out as a prominent figure.” \nSarah Stone’s Unseen World continues at Peter Harrington Rare Books in Manhattan through February 7.\nBarn Owl (Tyto alba)\nUnidentified Pheasant\nBornean Peacock Pheasant (Polyplecton schleirmacheri)\nDemoiselle Crane (Anthopoides virgo)\nRufous Treepie (Dendrocitta vagabunda)\nUnidentified Parakeets\nGuianan Cock of the Rock (Rupicola rupicola)\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n            Artist Jeff Koons attended a dinner party organized by Jeffrey Epstein in 2013, years after the financier was first convicted of soliciting sex from a minor, according to emails released by the Department of Justice (DOJ) last week.In 2013, Epstein specifically requested that Koons attend a September 4 dinner party at his Upper East Side residence, an invitation Koons and his wife accepted via email. According to correspondences released by the DOJ last week, the dinner's guest list also included director Woody Allen and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Neil Gershenfeld. In an August 30 email, Epstein told his former personal assistant Lesley Groff that he had asked Gershenfeld, who collaborated with Koons on the sculpture \"Liberty Bell\" (2006–14), to invite the contemporary artist.In a statement to Hyperallergic sent through his gallery, Gagosian, Koons confirmed that he attended the party.“Upon the invitation of a professor at MIT, Neil Gershenfeld, my wife Justine and I attended a dinner at Jeffrey Epstein’s house,\" Koons said. \"Beyond attending the dinner, I did not have a relationship with Epstein.\"At the time of the dinner party, Epstein had already served 18 months in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to charges including soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida. Epstein made a plea deal with United States prosecutors that gave him immunity from federal charges, which became public information in 2009. By 2012, the financier had reportedly turned to philanthropy to counter \"bad press\" about his sexual crimes.Koons confirmed he would attend Epstein's dinner party in 2013. (screenshot via DOJ)Last week's released documents include other emails in which Epstein and affiliates make references to the dinner attended by Koons. Relaying information from Epstein to an individual whose name is redacted, Groff wrote in one message that a \"girl,\" whose name is blacked out in the documents, was also expected at the party.\"Jeffrey wants to make sure you know there is a dinner being planned for Sept. 4th,\" Groff wrote in the email, sent on August 30, 2013. \"Woody Allen is coming, this girl [redacted]...we are flying in Neil Gershenfeld from Boston..and as you see below, JE asked Neil to invite Jeff Koons... I do not know who else is going yet...\"In another email chain about the dinner party, Epstein and Groff discussed a woman whose name is also redacted. “OK to email her and ask her to come for an interview?” Groff asked Epstein.Epstein replied: “No interview. She is coming for dinner with Woody and Leon. I also asked Neil to invite Jeff Koons.” (Epstein is likely referring to billionaire financier and Museum of Modern Art trustee Leon Black, who made payments of over $150 million to Epstein. Black has denied any wrongdoing related to his association with Epstein.)Epstein and his assistant discussed the dinner party guests, including an unnamed woman, in emails. (screenshot via DOJ)On September 3, a day before the dinner, an individual apparently working for Epstein told a recipient whose name is redacted to learn more about Koons ahead of the party.\"Jeffrey wanted me to let you know Jeff Koons will be coming to the dinner on WEd. night along with his wife, Justine. Jeffrey thought you could ‘Google’ him before coming,\" the apparent Epstein affiliate wrote.The redacted recipient replied that they had just arrived in New York, apparently from a foreign country.“Thank you so much for your letters, dear [redacted]! I will certainly Google to get to know more about Mr.Koons!” the individual responded. “I've just arrived to NY this afternoon and I still don't have a new phone card to use in states. I have only my [redacted] number. But anyway, tomorrow I will get in downtown to present myself at school office and I will try to get my new phone number so that I could let you know it.”A person apparently representing Epstein asked an individual to research Koons before the dinner party. (screenshot via DOJ)Three days after the dinner party, Epstein told Allen's wife, Soon-Yi Previn, that he would like to visit Koons's studio. In emails, Epstein discussed plans to stop by with Woody Allen on November 8 that year.In a statement to Hyperallergic, Koons denied that the visit took place. \"To the knowledge of myself and my staff, Epstein never visited my studio,” Koons said.However, an email apparently containing Epstein’s November 8 schedule, sent that same morning, referenced a plan to \"go see Jeff Koons studio\" at 2 pm. Another message Epstein received a year later from a redacted contact references a visit to Koons’s studio: “Rudy Ovchinnikova is back in town! Going to her bday tonight! Remember she came with us to Jeff Koons studio?”Epstein's November 8, 2013 schedule, per an email sent that day (screenshot via DOJ)Though the fact that Epstein tried to visit Koons’s studio was included in an investigation from the Wall Street Journal in 2023, the revelation that the artist attended a dinner at the convicted sex offender’s home years after his conviction had not been previously reported.The new information comes from the most recent tranche of so-called “Epstein files,” some 3 million additional documents published on Friday, January 30, over a month after the missed deadline set by Congress. The batch of files initially exposed the identities of dozens of Epstein’s victims, including minors, prompting outcry from survivors and advocates. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Jeffrey Epstein\n                      \n                      \n                        Jeff Koons\n                      \n                  \n        ",

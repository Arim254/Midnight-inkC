    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImages cour­tesy of the Library of Con­gress.\nActor George Takei was once best known as Star Trek’s Mr. Sulu. He still is, of course, but over the last cou­ple decades his friend­ly, intel­li­gent, and wicked­ly fun­ny pres­ence on social media has land­ed him a new pop­u­lar role as a civ­il lib­er­ties advo­cate. Takei’s activist pas­sion is informed not only by his sta­tus as a gay man, but also by his child­hood expe­ri­ences. At the age of 5, Takei was round­ed up with his Amer­i­can-born par­ents and tak­en to a Japan­ese intern­ment camp in Arkansas, where he would live for the next three years. In an inter­view with Democ­ra­cy Now, Takei spoke frankly about this his­to­ry:\nWe’re Amer­i­cans…. We had noth­ing to do with the war. We sim­ply hap­pened to look like the peo­ple that bombed Pearl Har­bor. But with­out charges, with­out tri­al, with­out due process—the fun­da­men­tal pil­lar of our jus­tice system—we were sum­mar­i­ly round­ed up, all Japan­ese Amer­i­cans on the West Coast, where we were pri­mar­i­ly res­i­dent, and sent off to 10 barb wire intern­ment camps—prison camps, real­ly, with sen­try tow­ers, machine guns point­ed at us—in some of the most des­o­late places in this coun­try.\nTakei and his fam­i­ly were among over 100,000 Japanese-Americans—over half of whom were U.S. cit­i­zens—interned in such camps.\n\nInto one of these camps, Man­za­nar, locat­ed in the foothills of the Sier­ra Nevadas, cel­e­brat­ed pho­tog­ra­ph­er Ansel Adams man­aged to gain entrance through his friend­ship with the war­den. Adams took over 200 pho­tographs of life inside the camp.\nIn 1965, he donat­ed his col­lec­tion to the Library of Con­gress, writ­ing in a let­ter, “The pur­pose of my work was to show how these peo­ple, suf­fer­ing under a great injus­tice, and loss of prop­er­ty, busi­ness and pro­fes­sions, had over­come the sense of defeat and dis­pair [sic] by build­ing for them­selves a vital com­mu­ni­ty in an arid (but mag­nif­i­cent) envi­ron­ment.”\n\nAdams had anoth­er pur­pose as well—as schol­ar of the peri­od Frank H. Wu describes it—“to doc­u­ment some aspects of the intern­ment camp that the gov­ern­ment didn’t want to have shown.” These include “the barbed wire, and the guard tow­ers, and the armed sol­diers.” Pro­hib­it­ed from doc­u­ment­ing these con­trol mech­a­nisms direct­ly, the pho­tog­ra­ph­er “cap­tured them in the back­ground, in shad­ows,” says Wu: “In some of the pho­tos when you look you can see just faint­ly that he’s tak­ing a pho­to of some­thing, but in front of the pho­to you can see barbed wire, or on the ground you can see the shad­ow of barbed wire. Some of the pho­tos even show the blur­ry out­line of a soldier’s shad­ow.”\n\nThe pho­tographs doc­u­ment the dai­ly activ­i­ties of the internees—their work and leisure rou­tines, and their strug­gles to main­tain some sem­blance of nor­mal­cy while liv­ing in hasti­ly con­struct­ed bar­racks in the harsh­est of con­di­tions.\n\nThough the land­scape, and its cli­mate, could be des­o­late and unfor­giv­ing, it was also, as Adams couldn’t help but notice, “mag­nif­i­cent.” The col­lec­tion includes sev­er­al wide shots of stretch­es of moun­tain range and sky, often with pris­on­ers star­ing off long­ing­ly into the dis­tance. But the major­i­ty of the pho­tos are of the internees—men, women, and chil­dren, often in close-up por­traits that show them look­ing var­i­ous­ly hope­ful, hap­py, sad­dened, and resigned.\n\nYou can view the entire col­lec­tion at the Library of Con­gress’ online cat­a­log. Adams also pub­lished about 65 of the pho­tographs in a book titled Born Free and Equal: The Sto­ry of Loy­al Japan­ese Amer­i­cans in 1944. The col­lec­tion rep­re­sents an impor­tant part of Adams’ work dur­ing the peri­od. But more impor­tant­ly, it rep­re­sents events in U.S. his­to­ry that should nev­er be for­got­ten or denied.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Dis­ney Fought Fas­cism with Pro­pa­gan­da Car­toons Dur­ing World War II & Avert­ed Finan­cial Col­lapse\nDr. Seuss’ World War II Pro­pa­gan­da Films: Your Job in Ger­many (1945) and Our Job in Japan (1946)\nAnsel Adams Reveals His Cre­ative Process in 1958 Doc­u­men­tary\nDis­cov­er Ansel Adams’ 226 Pho­tos of U.S. Nation­al Parks (and Anoth­er Side of the Leg­endary Pho­tog­ra­ph­er)\nDr. Seuss Draws Anti-Japan­ese Car­toons Dur­ing WWII, Then Atones with Hor­ton Hears a Who!\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Psychology |   \tNovember 25th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn his new video above, the writer Daniel Pink pro­pos­es the fol­low­ing exer­cise: “Grab a book and time your­self. How long can you read with­out get­ting up or check­ing your phone? Real­ly try to push your­self, but don’t judge your­self if it’s only a few min­utes. Write down your time; that’s your base­line.” From there, you “train your atten­tion like a mus­cle: build it by start­ing small and grad­u­al­ly stretch­ing it.” This is just one of five strate­gies he rec­om­mends to “fix your atten­tion span,” a repair of which more and more of us feel in need the deep­er we get into the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry. If even open­ing up a book sounds like a bit much, first take up Pink’s chal­lenge of watch­ing this four-and-a-half minute video “on full screen, 1x speed, with no dis­trac­tions.”\nAs with any endeav­or, it’s impor­tant to start small. Once you have your base­line, how­ev­er you’ve mea­sured it, you can set about improv­ing it. In order to place your­self well to do so, Pink rec­om­mends elim­i­nat­ing dis­trac­tions from your imme­di­ate envi­ron­ment, which has already been “rigged against you,” not least by social media com­pa­nies: hence the impor­tance of cre­at­ing a “no phone zone,” or at least per­ma­nent­ly turn­ing off noti­fi­ca­tions.\nDraw­ing on the work of Cal New­port (pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture), he also sug­gests cre­at­ing cues — using cer­tain phys­i­cal move­ments, cer­tain music, cer­tain scents — that sig­nal your brain to go into work mode. But even in work mode, you should make sure to take breaks, delib­er­ate­ly, every 90 min­utes, or at what­ev­er inter­val your brain starts per­form­ing like a tod­dler in a melt­down.\nOn the high­est lev­el of all, we must “recon­nect atten­tion to mean­ing.” In oth­er words, we have to under­stand the rea­sons we’re doing a task, if any, before we can hope to con­cen­trate on it. “I learned this myself on my last book,” Pink says. “I was strug­gling. I was dis­tract­ed. I was on my phone and watch­ing sports high­lights rather than my work, and I real­ized the prob­lem was that I did­n’t know why I was writ­ing this book. I did­n’t have a pur­pose.” Only when he final­ly artic­u­lat­ed the ben­e­fit of doing that work, and then post­ed that artic­u­la­tion above his desk, did it start to flow. When next you find your­self unable to stick to a task on the job, a per­son­al project, or a book — whether you’re read­ing or writ­ing one — ask your­self: Why am I doing this? Maybe the answer will empow­er you to attend to it. Or maybe you’ll be bet­ter off doing some­thing else entire­ly.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow to Focus: Five Talks Reveal the Secrets of Con­cen­tra­tion\nThe Case for Delet­ing Your Social Media Accounts & Doing Valu­able “Deep Work” Instead, Accord­ing to Com­put­er Sci­en­tist Cal New­port\nThe Sur­pris­ing Pow­er of Bore­dom: It Lets You Con­front Big Ques­tions & Give Life Mean­ing\nWhy You Should Only Work 3–4 Hours a Day, Like Charles Dar­win, Vir­ginia Woolf & Adam Smith\nHow to Read Five Books Per Month & Become a Seri­ous Read­er: Tips from Deep Work Author Cal New­port\nMedieval Monks Com­plained About Con­stant Dis­trac­tions: Learn How They Worked to Over­come Them\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tNovember 24th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nNew York isn’t the old­est city in the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca, and it cer­tain­ly isn’t the newest. But it is, quite pos­si­bly, the Amer­i­can city where more lay­ers of his­to­ry coex­ist than any oth­er, a qual­i­ty that man­i­fests most vivid­ly in its built envi­ron­ment. Even the most casu­al tourist can sense the sheer vari­ety of time peri­ods embod­ied in the build­ings around them on, say, a stroll down Broad­way — one of the streets fea­tured in the ten-part walk­ing tour com­piled in the new Archi­tec­tur­al Digest video above. As a whole, it offers a two-hour jour­ney through the city begin­ning in Cen­tral Park and end­ing on Wall Street.\nIn between come on-foot exam­i­na­tions of every­thing from the fin-de-siè­cle “apart­ment hotels” of the Upper West Side to the recent­ly built “super-tall” res­i­den­tial tow­ers of West 57th Street to the devel­op­ments atop the buried Grand Cen­tral Sta­tion to the dis­used indus­tri­al rail­way now known — and imi­tat­ed around the world — as a lin­ear park called the High Line. \nTend though long­time New York­ers may to regard each part of the city as more or less a nation unto itself, a per­spec­tive with a bit more dis­tance reveals signs of the nev­er-end­ing social, eco­nom­ic, and aes­thet­ic exchange between them: an impor­tant fac­tor in how the use of and role played by even the city’s most august struc­tures has been sub­ject to change after unan­tic­i­pat­ed change.\nHelp­ing us to under­stand all this are archi­tects Michael Wyet­zn­er and Nick Potts, both pro­fes­sion­al­ly well placed to explain both the big pic­ture of New York’s evo­lu­tion and the sig­nif­i­cance of the var­i­ous odd­i­ties and eccen­tric­i­ties on its streets. Even an archi­tec­tur­al lay­man would take impressed notice while pass­ing, say, the man­sions once inhab­it­ed by Alexan­der Hamil­ton and Aaron Burr; the jagged bunker that has housed the Whit­ney Muse­um of Amer­i­can Art, the Met Breuer, and Frick Madi­son; the impos­si­bly skin­ny-look­ing sky­scrap­ers of the so-called “Bil­lion­aire’s Row”; or the Dako­ta, John Lennon’s final res­i­dence. But to learn what such build­ings have to tell us about the his­to­ry and nature of New York, we must look at them, as anoth­er famous rock star once sang, thru’ these archi­tects’ eyes.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Lost Neigh­bor­hood Buried Under New York City’s Cen­tral Park\nA Whirl­wind Archi­tec­tur­al Tour of the New York Pub­lic Library — “Hid­den Details” and All\nArchi­tect Breaks Down the Design Of Four Icon­ic New York City Muse­ums: the Met, MoMA, Guggen­heim & Frick\nEvery Hid­den Detail of New York’s Clas­sic Sky­scrap­ers: The Chrysler, Empire State & Wool­worth Build­ings\nA Walk­ing Tour of Los Ange­les Archi­tec­ture: From Art Deco to Cal­i­for­nia Bun­ga­low\nA 5‑Hour Walk­ing Tour of Paris and Its Famous Streets, Mon­u­ments & Parks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Animation, History |   \tNovember 25th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nYou might know Win­sor McCay (1867? ‑1934) for the gor­geous­ly sur­re­al Lit­tle Nemo com­ic strip or for his ear­ly ani­mat­ed short Ger­tie the Dinosaur (1914). But did you know that he also cre­at­ed some of the ear­li­est exam­ples of ani­mat­ed pro­pa­gan­da ever?\nOn May 7, 1915, the RMS Lusi­ta­nia was just off the coast of Ire­land, head­ing towards its des­ti­na­tion of Liv­er­pool, when a Ger­man U‑boat attacked the ship with­out warn­ing. Eigh­teen min­utes after two tor­pe­does slammed into the ship, it was under water. 1,198 died. The furor over the inci­dent even­tu­al­ly led to the Unit­ed States enter­ing WWI.\nAt the time of the sink­ing, McCay was employed by William Ran­dolph Hearst as an edi­to­r­i­al car­toon­ist. Though McCay was incensed by the attack, Hearst was an iso­la­tion­ist and demand­ed that he draw anti-war car­toons. This grat­ed on the artist more and more until final­ly he decid­ed to fol­low up on his huge­ly suc­cess­ful Ger­tie the Dinosaur by mak­ing The Sink­ing of the Lusi­ta­nia (1918), which you can see above.\nThe movie took two years of painstak­ing effort to make and con­sist­ed of over 25,000 drawings—all done by hand and most done by McCay him­self dur­ing his free time after work.\nCom­pared to oth­er ani­ma­tion done around this time, the film is both stark and seri­ous, lend­ing it the air of a doc­u­men­tary. The piece, which isn’t much short­er than the actu­al time it took for the Lusi­ta­nia to sink, gives a blow-by-blow account of the attack. Though the inci­dent is depict­ed large­ly from afar, as if from a cam­era on anoth­er ship, McCay doesn’t shy away from show­ing some real­ly gut-wrench­ing moments of the tragedy up close. At one point, there is a shot of a des­per­ate moth­er try­ing to keep her baby above the waves. At anoth­er point, dozens of peo­ple are seen bob­bing in the chop­py seas like drift­wood.\nAnd, just in case you haven’t quite grasped the thrust of the film, McCay includes some inter­ti­tles, which are, even by the stan­dards of war pro­pa­gan­da, pret­ty heavy-hand­ed.\nThe babe that clung to his mother’s breast cried out to the world – TO AVENGE the most vio­lent cru­el­ty that was ever per­pe­trat­ed upon an unsus­pect­ing and inno­cent peo­ple.\nAnd\nThe man who fired the shot was dec­o­rat­ed for it by the Kaiser! – AND YET THEY TELL US NOT TO HATE THE HUN.\nThe curi­ous thing about the movie, con­sid­er­ing its sub­ject mat­ter, is how beau­ti­ful it is. Just look at the styl­ized lines of the ocean, the baroque arabesques of the smoke com­ing off the ship’s smoke­stacks, the ele­gant use of neg­a­tive space. Each and every cel of the movie is wor­thy of get­ting framed. How many war pro­pa­gan­da movies can you say that about?\nYou can find The Sink­ing of the Lusi­ta­nia in the Ani­ma­tion sec­tion of our col­lec­tion of Free Movies Online: Great Clas­sics, Indies, Noir, West­erns.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch the Sink­ing of the Lusi­ta­nia Ani­mat­ed in Real Time (1915)\nWatch Win­sor McCay’s Lit­tle Nemo and Ger­tie the Dinosaur, and Wit­ness the Birth of Mod­ern Ani­ma­tion (1911–1914)\nHow Dis­ney Fought Fas­cism with Pro­pa­gan­da Car­toons Dur­ing World War II & Avert­ed Finan­cial Col­lapse\nWatch Dzi­ga Vertov’s Sovi­et Toys: The First Sovi­et Ani­mat­ed Movie Ever (1924)\nJonathan Crow is a writer and film­mak­er whose work has appeared in Yahoo!, The Hol­ly­wood Reporter, and oth­er pub­li­ca­tions. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCombining hand-carved Japanese cypress with crystal-clear acrylic resin, Ayako Kita sculpts tender, emotive figures. For her current exhibition, The End of the Day Begins at FUMA Contemporary Tokyo, she focuses on the transitional moment of returning home, in which seemingly mundane tasks like switching on a light or opening a curtain are imbued with consequence, frozen in time.\nKita’s work emphasizes an often introspective world, where a young woman or girl’s consciousness, emotions, and anxieties manifest in uncanny scenarios. The titles usually offer important clues, too. In “me & me,” for example, an extra pair of legs is literally tethered to the character’s own limbs, as if another half-formed parallel version of her person is always present. And change is in the air in “Premonition,” where a slightly apprehensive expression is accompanied by a gust of wind.\n“Premonition” (2022), Japanese cypress and acrylic resin, 29 x 17 x 11 centimeters\nIn her most recent work, the figures exhibit expressions of curiosity, thoughtfulness, and faint concern, gazing directly at the viewer, as if seeing us unexpectedly across a room or out a window. “When I began to think about creating a world in which all the pieces would connect as one continuous story, this series naturally came to mind,” Kita says in a statement.\nThe End of the Day Begins includes works the artist has made throughout the past five years. Her newest pieces combine figures with furnishings and architectural elements, a theme she first explored when she was a student. “Rather than a return to my origins, this production became a time to reaffirm that these scenes still exist vividly within me,” she says.\nThe End of the Day Begins continues through November 29 in Tokyo.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nSebastian Foster is thrilled to present its 2025 Fall Print Set, marking the 13th anniversary of the collection since publishing the first set in 2012. The new release features 20 works by well-established illustrators, printmakers, and painters from around the world.\nThe prints in this set have all been published as relatively small editions, hand-signed, and numbered by the artists. Encompassing an eclectic array of mediums and themes, the collection showcases work from artists previously featured on Colossal, including Jeremy Miranda’s dreamy oil paintings, Kenny Harris’s delicately rendered moka pots, and Grant Haffner’s trippy landscapes in bold color palettes.\nDaniel Freaker, “Abode of Promise”\nBased in Austin but operating solely online, Sebastian Foster shifted focus from a traditional brick-and-mortar gallery handling original work to working with artists to make their paintings into limited print editions, publishing more than 1,000 editions since opening in the late 2000s.\nWhether you’re looking for the next piece to add to your collection or for meaningful holiday gifts, head to the gallery’s site to shop the 2025 Fall Print Set today.\nGrant Haffner, “Goodnight”\nMichael McGrath, “Bird Repellent”\nHiroki Kawanabe, “Night Drive”\nGraham Franciose, “Well Shit”\nMia Bergeron, “Constellation”\nKenny Harris, “Moka With Lemons”\nMatte Stephens, “New York”\nSusan Abbott, “Blue House in Summer”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAggression and struggles for power abound in the vivid paintings of Ángela Ferrari. The Argentinian artist is keen to explore the limits and consequences of control through scenes rife with antagonism: dogs nip at each other, horses buck and bare their teeth, and birds lie lifeless. Evoking hunting paintings and masculine displays of pride for a kill, Ferrari’s works consider the relationship between predator and prey.\nIn her most recent body of work, They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?, the artist extends her proclivity for teasing out the tension between life and death. There are tiny works with looser brushstrokes that zero in on singular moments of tension, while a spate of large pieces magnify several tussles with vivid details. \n“Aurora IX” (2024), oil on linen, 60 x 80 centimeters\nPaintings like “Aurora” stretch nearly 12 feet wide and present a diverse group of fowl with various dispositions, all against a stunning mottled sky. Some creatures appear on the verge of an inevitable battle, while others have already succumbed or go about their lives seemingly unaffected.\nSharing a partial title with the 2024 painting “Aurora IX,” this expansive piece similarly brings together themes of decay and vitality through flowers and vibrant feathers falling to the earth after being plucked. Sensual fabrics and grand spaces complement Ferrari’s rich color palette in several works and cement her self-described “grotesque-passionate baroque” style. \nWhereas earlier paintings are set indoors, the pieces in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? are fully in the wild. This exhibition—which shares a title with the 1969 Sydney Pollack film—brings violence and suffering front and center, a stark contrast to its presence in the background or underfoot in historical genre paintings of hunts. In doing so, Ferrari highlights a ruthless nature in which vying for domination always begets drama. Rather than dismiss such displays of hostility as inevitable, she prompts an urgent investigation into what caused such a commotion in the first place.\nThey Shoot Horses, Don’t They? is on view through December 14 at Povos in Chicago.

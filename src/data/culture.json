But the life to which Borges attach­es his labyrinths is a librar­i­an’s life; the strands that anchor his fic­tions are the obscure schol­ar­ly ref­er­ences he weaves through­out his text. Borges brings this ten­den­cy to whim­si­cal employ in his non­fic­tion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3auGKng\"><em>Book of Imag­i­nary Beings</em>,</a> a het­ero­ge­neous com­pendi­um of crea­tures from ancient folk­tale, myth, and demonolo­gy around the world.</p>\n<p>Borges him­self some­times remarks on how these ancient sto­ries can float too far away from rati­o­ci­na­tion. The “absurd hypothe­ses” regard­ing the myth­i­cal Greek Chimera, for exam­ple, “are proof” that the ridicu­lous beast “was begin­ning to bore peo­ple…. A vain or fool­ish fan­cy is the def­i­n­i­tion of Chimera that we now find in dic­tio­nar­ies.” Of  what he calls “Jew­ish Demons,” a cat­e­go­ry too numer­ous to parse, he writes, “a cen­sus of its pop­u­la­tion left the bounds of arith­metic far behind.</p>\n<p>Through­out the cen­turies, Egypt, Baby­lo­nia, and Per­sia all enriched this teem­ing mid­dle world.” Although a less­er field than angelol­o­gy, the influ­ence of this fas­ci­nat­ing­ly diverse canon only broad­ened over time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“The natives record­ed in the Tal­mud” soon became “thor­ough­ly inte­grat­ed” with the many demons of Chris­t­ian Europe and the Islam­ic world, form­ing a sprawl­ing hell whose denizens hail from at least three con­ti­nents, and who have mixed freely in alchem­i­cal, astro­log­i­cal, and oth­er occult works since at least the 13th cen­tu­ry and into the present.

Pre­dat­ing Islam, “the depic­tion of demons in the Near East… was fre­quent­ly used for mag­i­cal and tal­is­man­ic pur­pos­es,” just as it was by occultists like Aleis­ter Crow­ley at the time these illus­tra­tions were made.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“Not all of the 56 paint­ed illus­tra­tions in the man­u­script depict demon­ic beings,” the Pub­lic Domain Review points out. “Amongst the horned and fork-tongued we also find the archangels Jibrāʾīl (Gabriel) and Mikāʾīl (Michael), as well as the ani­mals — lion, lamb, crab, fish, scor­pi­on — asso­ci­at­ed with the zodi­ac.” But in the main, it’s demon city. What would Borges have made of these fan­tas­tic images? No doubt, had he seen them, and he had seen plen­ty of their like before he lost his sight, he would have been delight­ed.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>A blue man with claws, four horns, and a pro­ject­ing red tongue is no less fright­en­ing for the fact that he’s wear­ing a can­dy-striped loin­cloth. In anoth­er image we see a mous­ta­chioed goat man with tuber-nose and pol­ka dot skin mani­a­cal­ly con­coct­ing a less-than-appetis­ing dish. One recur­ring (and wor­ry­ing) theme is demons vis­it­ing sleep­ers in their beds, scenes involv­ing such pleas­ant activ­i­ties as tooth-pulling, eye-goug­ing, and — in one of the most engross­ing illus­tra­tions — a bout of foot-lick­ing (per­formed by a rep­til­ian feline with a shark-toothed tail).</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s a play­ful Boschi­an qual­i­ty to all of this, but while we tend to see Bosch’s work from our per­spec­tive as absurd, he appar­ent­ly took his bizarre inven­tions absolute­ly seri­ous­ly. So too, we might assume, did the illus­tra­tor here. We might won­der, as Woolf did, about this work as the prod­uct of “suf­fer­ing human beings… attached to gross­ly mate­r­i­al things, like health and mon­ey and the hous­es we live in.” What kinds of ordi­nary, mate­r­i­al con­cerns might have afflict­ed this artist, as he (we pre­sume) imag­ined demons goug­ing the eyes and lick­ing the feet of peo­ple tucked safe­ly in their beds?</p>\n<p>See many more of these strange paint­ings at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/persian-demons-from-a-book-of-magic-and-astrology-1921\">the Pub­lic Domain Review</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-293x360.jpg 293w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-195x240.jpg 195w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-300x369.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-293x360.jpg 293w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-195x240.jpg 195w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-300x369.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-300x379.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-300x379.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/04/persian-manuscripts-spanning-700-years-now-digitized-and-available-online.html\">700 Years of Per­sian Man­u­scripts Now Dig­i­tized and Avail­able Online</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to 2,178 Occult Books Now Digitized & Put Online, Thanks to the Ritman Library and <i>Da Vinci Code</i> Author Dan Brown\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/08/2178-occult-books-now-digitized-put-online.html\">2,178 Occult Books Now Dig­i­tized & Put Online, Thanks to the Rit­man Library and <i>Da Vin­ci Code</i> Author Dan Brown</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/12/160000-pages-of-glorious-medieval-manuscripts-digitized.html\">160,000 Pages of Glo­ri­ous Medieval Man­u­scripts Dig­i­tized: Vis­it the Bib­lio­the­ca Philadel­phien­sis</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>"

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In the hands of Argentinian tattooer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pontotattoo/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Ponto</a>, lush gradients and surreal compositions emerge from layers and layers of tiny dots. Entirely self-taught, Ponto never learned to use the machines typical for many artists working in the medium. He instead embarked on an experimental journey 13 years ago that has since produced a vibrant catalog of designs, from a grayscale eye crying primary colors or a vivid beam shooting from a flying saucer.</p>\n<p>Ponto shares that while his process is typically slower than that of artists who utilize machines, his tools and approach are simple. “I just have to layer dots until I reach my desired saturation and look, which varies from skin to skin and the tattoo’s characteristics,” he says. “I use several kinds of needles to play with dot width, resolution, tattooing depth, ink saturation, and a few more variables to create my designs.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5.jpg\" alt=\"a white arm with a tattoo by Nano Ponto of a vibrant gradient beaming from a flying saucer\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5.jpg 1200w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-640x533.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-960x800.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-768x640.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n<p>While based in Buenos Aires, Ponto has spent the past few years moving between Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. Travel has been essential to his development from the beginning because most artists work with newer technologies and don’t share the same technical approaches. “Ten years ago, it was key for me to start traveling to meet other handpoked tattoo artists to share experience and knowledge, as there was no one in Argentina I could do this with,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Ponto’s latest travels have brought him to Brooklyn, where he’s a guest resident this month at <a href=\"https://www.ateliereva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Atelier Eva</a>.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>Throughout history, those who wield the most power or resources are typically the ones whose stories are represented in textbooks, passed down through generations, and etched into our collective consciousness. Without intentional effort, it can be difficult to hear more than a single narrative.</p>\n<p>In art history, the reality is much the same. The canon has always privileged white male artists, from titans of the Renaissance like Michelangelo to bad-boy American Modernists like Jackson Pollock. The foundations of 19th-century American landscape painting, for example, are inextricable from the belief in Manifest Destiny, as the American government violently expanded westward. And Western painting and sculpture have historically reigned supreme in the market-driven hallows of galleries and auction houses. But what of the incredible breadth of—namely Indigenous—art forms that have long been overlooked?</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8.jpg\" alt=\"a columnar, geometric sculpture by Dyani White Hawk coated in patterns of beadwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-8-1366x2048.jpg 1366w\" /><figcaption>“Visiting” (2024), acrylic, glass beads, thread, and synthetic sinew on aluminum panel with a quartz base, 120 x 15.5 x 15.5 inches (base 5 x 24 x 24 inches).

Photo by Rik Sferra</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For Sičáŋǧu Lakota artist <a href=\"https://www.dyaniwhitehawk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dyani White Hawk</a>, the construction of American art history lies at the core of her multidisciplinary practice. “She lays bare the exclusionary hierarchies that have long governed cultural legitimacy, authority, value, and visibility,” says a joint statement from Alexander Gray Associates and Bockley Gallery. “In this light, White Hawk reframes Indigenous art and Western abstraction as inseparable practices—linked by a shared history that dominant narratives have labored to separate and obscure.”</p>\n<p>Pablo Picasso is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20141112-great-artists-steal\" target=\"_blank\">credited</a> with the saying, “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” Seminal paintings like “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” and others created in the early 1900s would not exist if it were not for his fascination with African masks. White Hawk draws a similar parallel between the 20th-century Color Field and Minimalism movements to highlight the influence of Native American art forms in the evolution of these styles. She prompts viewers to consider how these notions shape our aesthetic perceptions and judgment while also considering the role of cultural memory and community.</p>\n<p>White Hawk’s work spans painting, sculpture, photography, performance, and installations. Alongside oil and acrylic paint, she incorporates materials commonly used in Lakota art forms, like beads, porcupine quills, and buckskin.</p>\n<p>“I strive to create honest, inclusive works that draw from the breadth of my life experiences,” White Hawk says in a statement, merging influences from Native and non-Native, urban, academic, and cultural education systems. She continues: “This allows me to start from center, deepening my own understanding of the intricacies of self and culture, correlations between personal and national history, and Indigenous and mainstream art histories.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5.jpg\" alt=\"a geometric patterned wall installation by Dyani White Hawk of a Native American pattern\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-640x368.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-960x552.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-768x442.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-5-1536x884.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>“Nourish” (2024), ceramic tile installation of handmade tiles by Mercury Mosaics, 174 x 369 1/2 inches.

Vibrant geometric patterns are direct and visceral in a way that “unsettles the categories of Eurocentric art history,” the galleries say.</p>\n<p>White Hawk notes that her mixed-media canvases honor “the importance of the contributions of Lakota women and Indigenous artists to our national artistic history…as well as the ways in which Indigenous artists helped shape the evolution of the practices of Western artists who were inspired by their work.”</p>\n<p>“Nourish,” an installation that spans nearly 31 feet wide and 14.5 feet tall, comprises thousands of handmade ceramic tiles that visually reference Lakota beadwork and quillwork. Permanently installed at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the piece enters into a dialogue with the history of American Modernism through painters such as Marsden Hartley and Pollock, who are credited as trailblazers of American abstraction and yet were indelibly influenced by Native American art.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of a geometric sculpture by Dyani White Hawk coated in patterns of beadwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-640x960.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-960x1440.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/white-hawk-6-1366x2048.jpg 1366w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Visiting.” Collection of the Denver Art Museum. Photo by Rik Sferra</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“At its core, White Hawk’s practice is sustained by ancestral respect and guided by value systems that center relationality and care for all life,” the galleries say. “By addressing inequities affecting Native communities, she creates opportunities for cross-cultural connection and prompts a critical examination of how artistic and national histories have been constructed. Her work invites viewers to evaluate current societal value systems and their capacity to support equitable futures.”</p>\n<p>Minneapolis-based Bockley Gallery, which has represented White Hawk for more than a decade, has recently announced co-representation of the artist with New York City-based Alexander Gray Associates, where she’ll present a solo exhibition in fall 2026. If you’re in Minneapolis, <em>Love Language </em>opens on October 18 at the <a href=\"https://walkerart.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Walker Art Center</a> and continues through February 15.

That artist is known for her immersive <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/chiharu-shiota\">string installations</a>, inviting us into emotive, atmospheric experiences that tap into both universal and deeply personal narratives.</p>\n<p>In <em>Two Home Countries</em>, viewers enter a vivid world shaped by red thread, redolent of intertwined veins and blood vessels that attach to the floor, take on the shapes of houses, and spread through an entire room with a cloud-like aura of red—filled with written pages. Themes of memory, mortality, connection, identity, and belonging weave through Shiota’s pieces, exploring “how pain, displacement, boundaries, and existential uncertainty shape the human condition and our understanding of self,” the gallery says.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of a full-room installation of red fiber and paper pages by Chiharu Shiota\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-640x461.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-960x692.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-768x554.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shiota-5-1536x1107.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Detail of “Diary” (2025) in ‘Chiharu Shiota: Two Home Countries’ at Japan Society Gallery, New York, 2025</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An expansive, room-sized work titled “Diary,” which is based on an <a href=\"https://www.chiharu-shiota.com/diary-1\" target=\"_blank\">earlier installation</a> and commissioned anew for <em>Two Home Countries, </em>incorporates a dense web of yarn in which float pages of journals that once belonged to Japanese soldiers. Some were also penned by German civilians in the post-war era. “The accumulated pages reveal an expansive record of shared human existence across national boundaries,” the gallery says.</p>\n<p>“When the body is gone, the objects which surrounded them remain behind,” Shiota says in a statement. “As I wander the stalls of the markets in Berlin, I find especially personal items like photographs, old passports, and personal diaries. Once, I found a diary from 1946, which was an intimate insight into the person’s life and experiences.” For Shiota, the power of these objects are revealed in how she feels the presence of writer’s “inner self.”</p>\n<p><em>Two Home Countries </em>is on view through January 11 in New York City.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>When playwright Tennessee Williams reflected on the oeuvre of photographer <a href=\"http://www.stephenshore.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Shore</a> in 1982, he said, “His work is Nabokovian for me: Exposing so much and yet leaving so much room for your imagination to roam and do what it will.” The sentiment mirrors not only the power of Shore’s work but the capacity of street photography, more broadly, to provoke wonder and curiosity where we least expect it: the everyday.</p>\n<p>Shore was among the first to adopt color photography as an artistic medium, traveling throughout America to document quotidian scenes of life in rural towns and big cities alike. His work followed behemoths of the medium like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/08/crafting-sanctuaries-black-spaces-great-depression-american-south/\">Walker Evans</a> and Robert Frank and set the stage for others who emerged in his footsteps, including Alec Soth, Nan Goldin, and Martin Parr, among many others.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-6.jpg\" alt=\"a photo by Stephen Shore of people walking on El Paso Street in El Paso, Texas\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-6.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-6-640x509.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-6-960x763.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-6-768x611.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-6-1536x1221.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Stephen Shore, “El Paso Street, El Paso, Texas, July 5, 1975” (1975), photograph, chromogenic print. Museum purchase with funds donated by Scott Offen. © Stephen Shore, photograph © Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Shore is included in <em>Faces in the Crowd: Street Photography </em>at <a href=\"https://www.mfa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</a>, which explores the ever-evolving techniques and approaches that photographers use to document people and daily life. Seminal works from the 1970s to the 1990s by Shore, Garry Winogrand, Helen Levitt, Dawoud Bey, and Yolanda Andrade, among others, are complemented by more recent contributions to the genre by artists like Parr, Luc Delahaye, Katy Grannan, Amani Willett, and Zoe Strauss.</p>\n<p>Today, smartphones with powerful digital cameras have made photography more accessible than ever—and also completely transformed the medium. With people always unabashedly filming—taking photos, making videos, posting to social media—in the city, “photographers are now less concerned with surreptitiously capturing an image and much more likely to collaborate with their subjects in the street,” the MFA says.</p>\n<p>The difference between snapshots and art is perhaps partly in intention, although that line is often purposely blurred. Bey’s striking “A Man and Two Women After a Church Service,” for example, captures a seemingly simple scene, yet the composition and clarity are a testament to timing and technical expertise. In what feels like simultaneously a public and private moment, the 1976 image glimpses both a particular scene and an American historical period.</p>\n<p>Whether taken decades ago or snapped within the past few years, the images in <em>Faces in the Crowd </em>invite us into each experience. Luc Delahaye’s “Taxi,” for example, captures a solemn, intimate, enigmatic moment as a mother holds her young son in her arms in the back of a vehicle. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-10.jpg\" alt=\"a photo by Luc Delahaye of a mother with her young boy on her lap, sitting in the back of a taxi\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-10.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-10-640x503.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-10-960x755.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-10-768x604.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/faces-10-1536x1208.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Luc Delahaye, “Taxi” (2016), photograph, chromogenic print.

Photograph © Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Yasuhiro Ishimoto’s crowd photo, taken from the hip, immerses us in the thrum of a city thoroughfare. And Yolanda Andrade captures an uncanny blip when a street performer disappears behind the unsettlingly large head of a puppet. The MFA says, “Drawn to photography’s narrative potential, many employ the camera as a tool of transformation, taking everyday pictures from the ordinary to the strangely beautiful or even ominous.”</p>\n<p><em>Faces in the Crowd </em>opens on October 11 and runs through July 13, 2026.

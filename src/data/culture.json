    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nI have tak­en more out of alco­hol than alco­hol has tak­en out of me. — Win­ston Churchill\nWin­ston Churchill had a rep­u­ta­tion as a bril­liant states­man and a prodi­gious drinker.\nThe for­mer prime min­is­ter imbibed through­out the day, every day.  He also burned through 10 dai­ly cig­ars, and lived to the ripe old age of 90.\nHis come­back to Field Mar­shal Bernard Mont­gomery’s boast that he nei­ther smoked nor drank, and was 100 per­cent fit was “I drink and smoke, and I am 200 per­cent fit.”\nFirst Lady Eleanor Roo­sevelt mar­veled “that any­one could smoke so much and drink so much and keep per­fect­ly well.”\nIn No More Cham­pagne: Churchill and His Mon­ey, author David Lough doc­u­ments Churchill’s dis­as­trous alco­hol expens­es, as well as the bot­tle count at Chartwell, his Ken­tish res­i­dence. Here’s the tal­ly for March 24,1937:\n180 bot­tles and 30 half bot­tles of Pol Roger cham­pagne\n20 bot­tles and 9 half bot­tles of oth­er cham­pagne\n100+ bot­tles of claret\n117 bot­tles and 389 half bot­tles of Barsac\n13 bot­tles of brandy\n5 bot­tles of cham­pagne brandy\n7 bot­tles of liqueur whisky\n\nAll that liquor was not going to drink itself.\nDid Churchill have a hol­low leg?  An extra­or­di­nar­i­ly high tol­er­ance? An uncan­ny abil­i­ty to mask his intox­i­ca­tion?\nWhiskey som­me­li­er Rex Williams, a founder of the Whiskey Tribe YouTube chan­nel, and pod­cast host Andrew Heaton endeav­or to find out, above, by ded­i­cat­ing a day to the British Bulldog’s drink­ing reg­i­men.\nThey’re not the first to under­take such a fol­ly.\nThe Dai­ly Telegraph’s Har­ry Wal­lop doc­u­ment­ed a sim­i­lar adven­ture in 2015, wind­ing up queasy, and to judge by his 200 spelling mis­takes, cog­ni­tive­ly impaired.\nWilliams and Heaton’s on-cam­era exper­i­ment achieves a Drunk His­to­ry vibe and tell­tale flushed cheeks.\nHere’s the drill, not that we advise try­ing it at home:\nBREAKFAST\nAn eye open­er of John­nie Walk­er Red — just a splash — mixed with soda water to the rim.\nFol­low with more of the same through­out the morn­ing.\nThis is how Churchill, who often con­duct­ed his morn­ing busi­ness abed in a dress­ing gown, man­aged to aver­age between 1 — 3 ounces of alco­hol before lunch.\nAppar­ent­ly he devel­oped a taste for it as a young sol­dier post­ed in what is now Pak­istan, when Scotch not only improved the fla­vor of plain water, ‘once one got the knack of it, the very repul­sion from the fla­vor devel­oped an attrac­tion of its own.”\nAfter a morn­ing spent sip­ping the stuff, Heaton reports feel­ing “play­ful and jokey, but not yet vio­lent.”\nLUNCH\nTime for “an ambi­tious quo­ta of cham­pagne!”\nChurchill’s pre­ferred brand was Pol Roger, though he wasn’t averse to Giesler, Moet et Chan­don, or Pom­mery,  pur­chased from the upscale wine and spir­its mer­chant Ran­dolph Payne & Sons,  whose let­ter­head iden­ti­fied them as sup­pli­ers to “Her Majesty The Late Queen Vic­to­ria and to The Late King William The Fourth.”\nChurchill enjoyed his impe­r­i­al pint of cham­pagne from a sil­ver tankard, like a “prop­er Edwar­dian gent” accord­ing to his life­long friend, Odette Pol-Roger.\nWilliams and Heaton take theirs in flutes accom­pa­nied by fish sticks from the freez­er case. This is the point beyond which a hang­over is all but assured.\nLunch con­cludes with a post-pran­di­al cognac, to set­tle the stom­ach and begin the diges­tion process.\nChurchill, who declared him­self a man of sim­ple tastes — I am eas­i­ly sat­is­fied with the best — would have insist­ed on some­thing from the house of Hine.\nRESTORATIVE  AFTERNOON NAP\nThis seems to be a crit­i­cal ele­ment of Churchill’s alco­hol man­age­ment suc­cess. He fre­quent­ly allowed him­self as much as 90 min­utes to clear the cob­webs.\nA nap def­i­nite­ly pulls our re-enac­tors out of their tail spins. Heaton emerges ready to “bluff (his) way through a meet­ing.”\nTEATIME\nI guess we can call it that, giv­en the tim­ing.\nNo tea though.\nJust a steady stream of extreme­ly weak scotch and sodas to take the edge off of admin­is­tra­tive tasks.\nDINNER\nMore cham­pagne!!! More cognac!!!\n“This should be the apex of our wit,” a bleary Heaton tells his belch­ing com­pan­ion, who fess­es up to vom­it­ing upon wak­ing the next day.\nTheir con­clu­sion? Churchill’s reg­i­men is unmanageable…at least for them.\nAnd pos­si­bly also for Churchill.\nAs fel­low Scotch enthu­si­ast Christo­pher Hitchens revealed in a 2002 arti­cle in The Atlantic, some of Churchill’s most famous radio broad­casts, includ­ing his famous pledge to “fight on the beach­es” after the Mir­a­cle of Dunkirk, were voiced by a pinch hit­ter:\nNor­man Shel­ley, who played Win­nie-the-Pooh for the BBC’s Children’s Hour, ven­tril­o­quized Churchill for his­to­ry and fooled mil­lions of lis­ten­ers. Per­haps Churchill was too much inca­pac­i­tat­ed by drink to deliv­er the speech­es him­self.\nOr per­haps the great man mere­ly felt he’d earned the right to unwind with a glass of Graham’s Vin­tage Char­ac­ter Port, a Fine Old Amon­til­la­do Sher­ry or a Fine Old Liquor brandy, as was his wont.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nWin­ston Churchill Gets a Doctor’s Note to Drink Unlim­it­ed Alco­hol While Vis­it­ing the U.S. Dur­ing Pro­hi­bi­tion (1932)\nWin­ston Churchill’s Paint­ings: Great States­man, Sur­pris­ing­ly Good Artist\nOh My God!

Like the freedoms we often take for granted, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was hard-won. The designation of the third Monday in January as an official holiday commemorating the legacy of this momentous civil rights leader came after a 15-year battle waged by activists and grassroots groups who, despite pushback from Congress, refused to back down. They knew that there was something powerful about coming together to reflect on the lessons Dr. King left us, and that inscribing a dedicated day in the federal calendar was a way of agreeing, collectively, that he cannot be forgotten.Today, Hyperallergic celebrates Dr. King's outsized contributions as well as the labor and perseverance of those who ensured his remembrance.

Schaller revisits Don Miller's 56-by-7-foot mural at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, DC, on the occasion of the work's 40th anniversary, and speaks to local public artists for whom the piece continues to resonate.

(photo by Brontë Wittpenn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)San Francisco's Tech Billionaires Don't Care About Your Art SchoolNews of the abrupt closure of the California College of the Arts (CCA) and its acquisition by Vanderbilt University sent shockwaves through the Bay Area community. But we shouldn't be surprised that San Francisco's tech titans didn't step in to save it, writes Christian L. Frock: The loss of CCA should be considered in relation to staggering wealth disparities and lack of social investment, primarily perpetuated by the technology sector, much of which has tight alliances with today’s leadership in Washington, DC. The indifference of wealth that has long-vexed San Francisco is now a systemic threat to the national ecosystem.What to See During San Francisco Art WeekDespite recent closures in San Francisco’s art world, there's been a mushrooming of alternative spaces, side hustles, home galleries, and nonprofits. Veteran Bay Area curator and writer Natasha Boas recommends the best shows to see during this year's San Francisco Art Week.Jozanne Rabyor on \"How to Protect Your Right to Culture\" by Anna Kornbluh:Brava! Bravo! Thanks for this informative and inspiring message. After reading it, I sent a donation to my local art museum, bought tickets to a live performance (dance in this case), and wrote to my Congresswoman in my purple district urging her to do whatever she can to support the arts and culture – on individual and collective levels – specifying several organizations you name in your piece and others. I asked her to stand up for our rights of speech and assembly. Thanks for the push!From the ArchiveThe March on Washington as seen in MLK/FBI (2020), dir.

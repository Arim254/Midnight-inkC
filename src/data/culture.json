    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for addressing issues of censorship and inequality, Iranian artist Arghavan Khosravi (previously) has long utilized her bold, fragmented works to confront large-scale problems relevant around the world. Her alluring color palettes and delicate motifs catch the eye and are paired with distinct symbols of tension: a chain lock, cords binding body parts, and roiling flames.\nWhile her concerns are global, Khosravi has always considered her practice somewhat of a balm that helps her cope with trying times. And so the inward turn of her latest body of work perhaps ventures farther into this territory as she allows herself to delve deep into a personal and collective subconscious.\n\nThe past year has engendered a period of introspection, which the artist translates into a collection of smaller, altar-esque pieces. She refers to them as “intimate constructions where interior space carries its own symbolism. It’s been a way to move inward for a moment, allowing ideas to surface without a predetermined destination.” \nBoth the subconscious and symbolic have long figured prominently in her work, and recent pieces are similar. Many layer seemingly disparate components into surreal scenes, with recurring imagery of long, flowing hair, bright orbs of light, birds, and patterns from historic Persian architecture and design. Whereas earlier works frequently incorporated windows, doorways, and other portal-like structures, Khosravi’s newer pieces peer outward from inside, inviting the viewer into a new realm.\nThe artist is in the early stages of preparing for an upcoming solo show at Uffner & Liu in New York next year. Until then, follow her practice on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAfter six momentous leaps from a small aircraft, skydiver Gabriel C. Brown completed his mission. Brown is friends with astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy and now, also one of his collaborators. Together, the pair created a stunning image that shows the adventurous subject falling in front of the sun.\nMcCarthy is known for his incredible patience and planning, which has led him to capture an array of striking photos and composites detailing cosmic phenomena. This most recent piece, titled “The Fall of Icarus,” details the roiling, fiery surface of the sun with his friend’s upside-down silhouette. The pair undertook this project this past weekend in Arizona.\n\nLike much of his work, this image is a composite that stitches together a collection of high-resolution captures. McCarthy and Brown had to coordinate the jump and subsequent shots to reveal the latter’s free fall, footage of which they share on Instagram. \n“The Fall of Icarus” is available as a limited-edition print in McCarthy’s shop, where you can find more of his work.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLi Songsong (previously) has long centered his practice around translating archival imagery, whether it be a portrait printed in a newspaper or still from a film. The Chinese artist is broadly interested in the ways that memories morph over time and how, when we’re reflecting on a moment well in the past, our clarity over the particulars can be hazy.\nHis new body of work, History Painting, takes a similar technical approach, although rather than interpret a specific scene, Li ventures into the abstract. Wide, impasto layers of oil paint cloak the large-scale canvas, creating a cacophony of color and texture that seems to swell upward while simultaneously pulling downward. As a filmed studio visit shows, the artist works from top down, adding one thick mark atop another in a sort of grid. \n“History VII: Snake Year” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nPace Gallery, which represents Li, shares that History Painting reflects more on his relationship to the medium than any specific visual source, although, given his past work, it’s difficult not to try to find definition within the composition. The clustered ridges of paint, for example, might evoke bodies huddled together in mass, their backs to the viewer as they move toward an unknown destination. For Li, these brushstrokes, while abstract, do retain a sense of action and autonomy, and he describes them as “agentive and idiosyncratic” even as they’re covered again and again.\nHistory Painting is on view through December 20 in New York.\n“Revolution” (2025), oil on canvas, 210 x 210 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n“History IX: Mercy” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\n“History IV: Sacrifice” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArtist Andres Serrano with his exhibition \"Portraits of America\" at the Maillol Museum in Paris on April 24, 2024 (photo by Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, newly released by the House Oversight Committee this week, revealed an exchange between the deceased sex offender and artist-provocateur Andres Serrano.\nOn October 10, 2016, less than a month before Donald Trump was elected to the presidency for the first time, Serrano discussed his voting intentions with Epstein.\n“I was prepared to vote against Trump for all the right reasons,” Serrano wrote to Epstein. “But I’m so disgusted by the outrage over ‘grab them by the pussy’ that I may give him my sympathy vote.”\nIn the same email exchange, Serrano tells Epstein that he had just returned from Ireland for his exhibition Torture. The artist shares a photo of himself posing with a photograph from the eponymous series, depicting a hooded individual.\nSerrano has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s request for comment through a publicist and direct channels.\nSerrano, born in New York, rose to prominence in the late 1980s for “Piss Christ” (1987), a photograph of a crucifix that he submerged in his own urine that was included in an exhibition funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. The work upset conservative evangelists and members of Congress. He’d described the work as exploring “being drawn to Christ yet resisting organized religion.”\nEpstein posed in a portrait for Serrano in 2019, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor and only months before the disgraced former financier was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial. Serrano also photographed Trump in 2004.\nScreenshot of an email exchange between Andres Serrano and Jeffrey Epstein that was released by the House Oversight Committee\nIn 2019, the artist displayed his collection of 1,000 Trump memorabilia items at a gallery in Chelsea in the installation The Game: All Things Trump. Earlier this year, Serrano proposed a Trump altar for the United States pavilion at the Venice Biennale with the same title.\nIn July, when Hyperallergic asked Serrano through a publicist if he thought his Trump pavilion proposal met the State Department’s criteria of “non-political” character for the Biennale competition, he replied in a statement, “Of course, I’m not political. I don’t judge, I observe.”\nThough couched in the language of satire, Serrano’s artworks and public statements have often veered into offensive territory. Grantmakers for the Arts in 2022 labeled a recorded keynote address by Serrano with a content warning: “We acknowledge that some viewers may find Andres Serrano’s remarks hurtful and harmful. While Grantmakers in the Arts respects Serrano’s artistry, we do not endorse the views or tenor of his keynote remarks.”\nThe most recent trove of the so-called Epstein files sheds further light on Epstein’s art dealings and connections within the art world. \nIn one conversation, Epstein and journalist Michael Wolff discussed the provenance of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi,” which became the most expensive painting sold at auction when it fetched $450.3 million at Christie’s in 2017. It was consigned by Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev and reportedly purchased by Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, believed to be a proxy buyer for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman; the work’s whereabouts are currently unknown.\n“Is it a coincidence that the Russian who bought the house in Palm Beach and knows all, is the same guy who sold a painting last year to mbs for 450 million dollars,” wrote Epstein, according to the email exchange, referring to Rybolovlev, who purchased a Florida home once owned by Trump. “That was only worth 1.5m?” \n“So MBS was paying him off? Why? Ideas?” Wolff pressed. \n“reminder trump overuled congress on yemen,” Epstein responded, before adding that his “art guyd [sic] said the painting wasn’t very good.”\nHyperallergic has contacted Wolff for comment on the conversation.\nIn other emails from February 2017, Epstein discussed acquiring works from artists in Los Angeles and Berlin with an individual, Etienne Binant, who appeared to be advising him on collecting pieces. In one exchange, Binant assures Epstein that they “never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or anything of the kind” and promises to take Epstein only to artists’ studios or homes.\nWhen Binant asked if they were “still on,” Epstein wrote: “yes, lets [sic] start. . yes we are on. sorry with trump around it been very crazy busy.” \nHyperallergic has attempted to reach Etienne Binant for comment.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\tThe Metropolitan Museum of Art has returned an 18th-century painting to a Korean temple that once housed a vast depiction of hell.\n\n\tThe painting, titled The Tenth King of Hell, dates to 1798 and was made during the Joseon Dynasty. It’s one panel of a 10-part piece known as Siwangdo formerly sited at Sinheungsa Temple in Sokcho, the head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Each of the panels depicts a king of the afterlife.\n\n\tAccording to the Yonhap news agency, the painting was “illicitly” taken from the temple in 1954. By that point, the Korean War had already ended, though the US continued to maintain a presence in the country. “A 1942 survey by the Japanese government-general of Korea recorded the painting’s presence at the temple, and its existence is also documented in photos taken by U.S. military officers between 1953 and 1954,” the news agency said.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe Met quietly announced the return on its website, saying that the work is “believed to have been taken while the Temple was under the control of the United States Army during the Korean War.” The museum said it had purchased the painting in 2007. \n\n\tAccording to a provenance on the museum’s site, the Met bought the work from collector Robert Moore via an LLC registered in the name of Michael C. Hughes, who now serves as head of Bonhams’s department for Chinese art. The Met said it had shown The Tenth King of Hell in presentations of its Korean art holdings in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\t“The Met has a long history of working with colleagues and institutions in Korea, and we look forward to continuing our collaborative efforts to enhance the world’s understanding and appreciation of the arts of Korea,” said Met director Max Hollein in a statement.\n\n\tSix of the panels of Siwangdo had already made it back to South Korea previously. All six of them were returned in 2020 by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which worked on the repatriation with the Jogye Order. LACMA said at the time that the works were “believed to have been looted by United States Army personnel during the Korean War.” The remaining three parts are still abroad, according to Yonhap.\n\n\t“We are delighted that the Tenth King of Hell has returned to its original home. Our cultural heritage holds its greatest meaning when it is in its rightful place,” said Lee Sang-rae, chairman of the Sokcho Committee for the Return of Cultural Heritage, which worked on the repatriation alongside the temple. “We will continue our efforts to ensure that the remaining three Ten Kings of the Underworld paintings still abroad can also return home.”\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Tenth King of Hell, 1798.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe Met has indicated an increased willingness to work with foreign nations to return artworks in its holdings. In 2023, the museum launched the Cultural Property Initiative, which asks appointed researchers to review objects in the collection with provenance issues.\n\n\tIn its recently reopened Rockefeller Wing for art from Africa, Oceania, and the ancient Americas, the Met makes provenance information available within the galleries. Some have said that gesture is not enough, however.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSotheby’s CEO Charles Stewart said the art market has entered a new phase this fall, with supply finally “catching up with the demand” after months of strong bidder activity. \n\n\tThe comment, made recently to CNBC, comes as New York’s marquee auction houses prepare for sales expected to total more than $1.4 billion, a jump of roughly 50 percent from last year and a possible turning point after three consecutive years of declines.\n\n\tThe November auctions will test whether renewed confidence from consignors and buyers can sustain a broader recovery. This season’s centerpiece is the estate of Leonard Lauder, whose 55 works at Sotheby’s are valued at more than $400 million, led by Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer, estimated above $150 million, and two Klimt landscapes carrying estimates of more than $70 million and $80 million. Sotheby’s will also offer six bronze Matisse sculptures and an Edvard Munch Midsummer Night.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tWorks from Jay and Cindy Pritzker’s collection add another $120 million in estimated value, including a Van Gogh still life priced above $40 million.\n\n\tAt Christie’s, highlights include a Monet Nymphéas and David Hockney’s Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy, each estimated at $40 million to $60 million, alongside a Mark Rothko expected to achieve more than $50 million.\n\n\tAdvisors say the combination of rare material and stronger macroeconomic conditions—lower interest rates, a buoyant stock market, and recent wealth creation—has helped entice sellers back to auction. “What we’ve seen more recently is the supply catching up with the demand,” Stewart told CNBC. “Something’s definitely shifted in the last two months.”\n\n\tSotheby’s also enters the week with added momentum from the debut of its new global headquarters in the Breuer Building on Madison Avenue, which has drawn more than 10,000 visitors since opening last week. Stewart said consignors have responded to the increased visibility.\n\n\tStill, significant pressure remains at the top of the market. Sales of works priced above $10 million fell 44 percent in the first half of 2025 compared with 2024 and remain 72 percent below the post-pandemic peak in 2022, according to Bank of America Private Bank. No lot surpassed $50 million at auction in the first half of the year, down from 13 sales above that level in 2022.\n\n\n\tBy contrast, the lower end of the market continues to strengthen: dealers with annual turnover under $250,000 reported a 17 percent rise in sales last year, while those above $10 million saw a 9 percent drop.\n\n\tWhether next week’s auctions confirm a true rebound or simply a brief correction, the split between the trophy market and the thriving lower tiers suggests the next phase of growth may not look much like the last one. Still, even a strong week won’t resolve the deeper question hanging over the season: whether the market’s future belongs to trophy-hunting megacollectors, or to a rising cohort reshaping demand from the ground up.\n",

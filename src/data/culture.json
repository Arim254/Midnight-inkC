    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen furniture maker Terry Facey began repairing historical pieces, his work often centered around 17th-century examples, thanks to an antique dealer who regularly brought him new items. Over time, the practice instilled a love for the beauty and precise craftsmanship of these centuries-old objects. And one day, he decided to try making one himself—only his iteration was really, really small.\nFacey works out of his shed, set up much the same as any other wood shop, except that everything is optimized for making scale miniatures. Recently, the V&A commissioned him to replicate an ornate, 17th-century table in its permanent collection at 1:8 scale. “It’s a piece that I’ve always loved,” Facey says. “It’s got the most wonderful barley twist legs, lovely inlay top with olive wood on six-sided pieces. It’s quite unique. I don’t usually see pieces with that configuration of veneer.”\n\n\n\nTo begin, Facey takes measurements of the original c.1674 marquetry table at the V&A in London Kensington. He then forages for twigs straight enough for carving an itty bitty version, and salvages 300-year-old oak from an old drawer because the old-growth wood has a grain that’s tighter, sturdier, and easier to work with than the modern oak one can buy at a home store, for example. “The old oak in this (drawer) is so fantastic,” Facey says. “To be able to use this as opposed to modern oak is just chalk and cheese.”\nArmed with chisels and saws that are very sharp and fine, Facey meticulously cuts dovetail joints and carves the replica twisted legs on a tiny lathe. He creates the tabletop from slices of the foraged twigs, reveling in the patterns that emerge from inside a seemingly unimpressive branch. Even tinier pieces are sliced from the heartwood to recreate the six-sided veneer pieces.\nFacey’s construction sheds light on the intricate process of furniture building, especially the art of elaborate veneer, no matter the scale. He says, “The olive wood table in the V&A, the fella who made it—or the people who made it, because they’re probably more than one—they used almost identical techniques [to] the techniques that I’ve used.”\nSee the video, and more like it, on the V&A’s YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

In a well-lit performance, Christian worship painter Vanessa Horabuena began the portrait with a bright-yellow cross and ambidextrous brush strokes as a cover of “Hallelujah” and other religious music played in the background.“There’s a young lady named Vanessa who’s one of the greatest artists anywhere in the world,” Trump reportedly told the audience. “She can paint, slowly, a beautiful portrait for the White House, or she can paint the most incredible painting in literally 10 minutes.” It is unclear what he was referring to regarding a White House portrait, but Trump replaced a depiction of President Barack Obama with a painting portraying his assassination attempt last year. At the time, Trump had not announced the name of the artist who created the replacement portrait. The president, during the New Year’s Eve performance, went on to say the artist “has done portraits” of him in the White House, and that he had “replaced a lot of people with those portraits.” The final product was a fair-skinned, light-eyed figure resembling an AI-generated rendition of the Shroud of Turin, which Trump described as “amazing.” “If I wanted a portrait I would call Vanessa,” Trump remarked to his wealthy audience.Before the bidding commenced, Trump called out to his sons, Donald and Eric, to name their favorite charities, reportedly announcing that the proceeds of the sale would go to the sheriff’s department and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Trump did not specify the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department, which has assisted the Secret Service in the president’s security. The final bid of just under $3 million came from an unnamed couple, a drastic price increase from the $15,000–$40,000 Horabuena usually sells her devotional works for.Also on New Year’s Eve, the White House projected the number \"250\" and red, white and blue shapes onto the Washington Monument to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. Similar projections will be shown nightly through January 5. The White House has repeatedly referenced the country’s 250th birthday in communications with the Smithsonian in its attempts to alter the telling of history in its exhibitions this year. In some ways, auctioning off a painting of Jesus for millions of dollars is perfectly in line with Trump’s penchant for leaning on religion when it suits him. Some religious commentators and figures have rejected Trump’s policies and actions, including mass deportations, as opposed to Christian values.Hyperallergic has reached out to Horabuena for comment. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            Believe it or not, the future of our nation may rest on how museums in the United States perform in 2026. We must deliver content about the 250th anniversary of our nation and its democracy that is thoughtful and comprehensive. We must make access to museums within reach of all Americans. And finally, museums must issue a challenge to the communities we serve: It’s time to know your nation’s history, if for no other reason than that it is our only path to building a more perfect union.It’s tempting to be dispirited as a museum professional these days. Headlines about a highly partisan political environment, a cynical public, and a tidal wave of industrial and cultural change driven by AI might lead one to think that museums have been relegated to the sidelines of our nation’s future.   Yet museums are among the most trusted institutions in our nation, scoring well above the government, the media, and non-governmental organizations on perceived credibility, trustworthiness, and not having a political agenda.At The New York Historical, as part of our programming to mark the 250th, we commissioned a poll to better understand how museums can leverage the trust they inspire to address the national frustration. There was much to cover — and we focused on asking Americans how they are feeling about the upcoming birthday of their nation and its democracy, as opposed to what they think of museums or what would most attract attention. Administered by Lincoln Park Strategies, it surveyed more than 2,000 US residents (with 43% identifying as moderate, 26% “liberal” or “very liberal,” and 28% “conservative” or “very conservative”). The poll results are compelling yet not surprising. Forty-two percent of Americans think the nation is hopelessly divided and will likely never be united again, and 45% say it's just a rough patch and that things will get better eventually. When it comes to living up to our democratic ideals, more respondents would give us an F (12%) than an A (11%). Merely 9% think the Founders would be very happy with how the legislative and judicial branches have evolved. Finally, most think we need to do much more to teach civics and history to schoolchildren.Discontent with today’s governance crosses generations. Asked which decade of their life was the best in terms of how the country was doing, no group chose the last 10 years, and the most overall favored decade was the 1990s (the ’80s was the narrow favorite of the Gen Xers and Boomers). We also asked how the Constitution and our government has and will serve Americans based on gender, age, and class, and there is broad agreement that White men have been favored by the current system over the last 50 years (84% says they are treated “reasonably” or “very” well), compared to people of color (48%) and lower-income Americans (38%). Respondents do not think these groups will be treated much differently by the Constitution and government over the next 50 years. It would be easy to view these figures through a negative lens, yet there is also reason to be inspired. These figures reflect an idealistic population that is frustrated, wants more unity, and understands the principles of our democracy. Facade banner of The New York Historical on Manhattan's Central Park West promoting the museum's year of 250th anniversary exhibitions (photo courtesy The New York Historical)This American idealism isn’t new. On July 9, 1776, George Washington ordered that the new Declaration of Independence be read to the Continental Army in Lower Manhattan; later that day, inspired by hearing the words spoken aloud, soldiers and sailors tore down a statue of King George III in Bowling Green. Idealism runs through our history. We currently have on display at our museum a 1774 petition written by enslaved Massachusetts residents asking for one day a week of freedom to earn their own wages. The invocation of our ideals helped fuel the turn-of-the-century women’s suffrage movement, Americans rallying to fight fascism, and even the flags and patriotism of my own progressive neighborhood in Brooklyn following September 11. America’s cultural landscape is perfectly designed for museums to harness this idealism and deepen citizens’ engagement with and knowledge of our nation’s history. With over 35,000 museums, our field is large and extremely diverse — reflecting the same of our nation — and there will be no one central place or way to celebrate. Nor should there be. In terms of content, our museums are meeting the moment. There are hundreds of major displays related to the 250th across the nation, with each institution flexing its own muscles. At The New York Historical, we are starting the year by leaning on archival items that illustrate the rhetoric and ideals that fueled the Declaration of Independence and by presenting a display of 150 years of immigration photography. The Moab Museum in Utah will soon have a 250th exhibition on the stories of the Colorado Plateau region. The Idaho State Museum will present America We Celebrate, a show on the traditions that have brought Americans, and Idahoans, together. In Massachusetts, the Concord Museum is returning to the material evidence of the Revolution itself, reexamining iconic 1775 objects. Every state has multiple contributions. And the large museums in our large cities each have compelling exhibitions, with accompanying concerts, programs, and more. Museum leaders know that just because we build it doesn’t mean that visitors will come. This is why messaging matters — as does operations – in the year ahead.We must innovate to generate visitors, including making it easier and more engaging to visit museums. We can start by staying open later. While most museums in Europe accommodate visitors' schedules and are open late on multiple evenings, many American museums follow bankers’ hours. Music, food, and booze help, too. When I was leading marketing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, two small additions — jazz music and drink specials — almost tripled Friday and Saturday evening attendance and delivered a younger, more diverse audience.When we invite visitors into our museums, we must resist the pull to simply commemorate and instead communicate the relevance of our history. We must not smooth over conflicts. The public is better served by and attracted to accurate descriptions of the challenges of building our nation.  I faced this question recently when, in a recent meeting, we needed copy for our façade banners announcing our 250th exhibitions. Bantering catchy titles on the Declaration or the 250th, we settled on a wordplay of sorts: “Democracy Lives Here.”America’s museums inspire trust in a nation where citizens are lamenting the gap between the ideals of our democracy and the actions of our government. Museums can and must provide a critical means to sustain the idealism of Americans, so that we can continue to build a more perfect union.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        Museums\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Much ink has been spilled over Wojnarowicz’s work as a visual and performance artist, writer, and, of course, queer activist during the AIDS epidemic. But the Leslie-Lohman Museum’s new catalog, corresponding to its exhibition focusing on Wojnarowicz’s nearly 500-photograph Arthur Rimbaud in New York project, takes on particular resonance today, in an age of growing authoritarianism. Earlier this fall, federal immigration agents — masked to avoid identification — stormed Lower Manhattan in an unexpected raid, not too far from the museum. In the past few years, a whole fashion aesthetic dubbed stealth wear has sprung up, designed to resist government and corporate surveillance, including the constant presence of CCTV cameras.Rimbaud died in 1891. Unexpectedly, years later, the New York Downtown arts scene and discontented youth elsewhere rediscovered Rimbaud’s transgressive poetry and held him up as a luminary of sorts; at one point, writer and artist Dennis Cooper even held a Rimbaud “live-alike” contest. Beyond Rimbaud’s writings, Wojnarowicz likely saw himself in Rimbaud’s life, too — both men were young, queer runaways. But as critic Craig Dworkin writes in his contribution to the catalog, “On the Riverbank,” Wojnarowicz’s use of Rimbaud as a symbol was broad and uncompromising in its sweep — a protest “not just against the corporation or the state, but against the state of the world.” David Wojnarowicz, \"Arthur Rimbaud in New York (Times Square)\" (1978–79), silver printAntonio Sergio Bessa, who also curated the show, writes in his contribution to the catalog that Wojnarowicz transforms “the figure of Rimbaud into a mask of youth which anyone can identify with.” In doing so, Wojnarowicz “removed himself from the picture, so to speak, thus allowing the viewer to merge with the subject.” The current political climate asks us to take that contradiction — and Bessa’s thesis about self-removal — even further. Wojnarowicz, and anyone who cares to resist problematic power structures, should seriously consider removing themselves as a form of resistance. Certainly, the most direct way to remove one’s likeness from the surveillance state is to literally mask, maybe to pick up some stealth wear. But removal as political resistance goes beyond that. It calls for a refusal to engage in situations that take up time and energy better used elsewhere. As artists like Jenny Odell have written, doing “nothing” is a way of resisting oppressive forces, too. It calls for creativity.In her essay “Our Rimbaud Mask,” writer Anna Vitale notes elliptically that “Wojnarowicz’s Rimbaud both represents and reflects while also sabotaging reflection.” Indeed, Wojnarowicz’s use of Rimbaud reflects his specific time period and represents what artists from that era stood for — among other things, expanding formal boundaries and pushing for LGBTQ+ rights. But Wojnarowicz’s use of a mask also sabotages reflection. As Bessa writes, it “merges” the viewer and the subject. By reflecting and obscuring at once, Wojnarowicz reminds us how, in a world where governmental and corporate surveillance often blur into one another, we have to be innovative and unexpected in our resistance. This might look like traditional protesting, or preventing ICE raids before they begin, or continuing to make art in the face of institutional violence. Whichever ways we choose to resist, I think Wojnarowicz and Rimbaud would approve. David Wojnarowicz, \"Rimbaud in New York (diner)\" (1978–79), silver printDavid Wojnarowicz: Arthur Rimbaud in New York (2025), edited by Antonio Sergio Bessa, is available for purchase online and in bookstores.

Look, I know New Year’s resolutions are a cliché, but I want to share mine with you: This year, I’m going to finish my thesis. I completed coursework for my master’s degree in Art History years ago and wrote about half of my thesis before letting other projects, and plain old exhaustion, push it down the priority list. This made me feel guilty, and the guilt became another deterrent. Every time I sat down to write, a sense of shame loomed over the work ahead like a slowly expanding ink blot. Any writer or artist will know this feeling quite well. Yet we find a way to keep going.This week, Hyperallergic’s reporters and contributors authored pieces that spoke to resilience and momentum, like critic Seph Rodney’s moving review of a Hew Locke exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art. In Locke’s suspended sculptures of vessels, loaded with cargo as though “plucked from the sea mid-journey,” Rodney sees how vestiges of the past carry into the present. The show, he writes, “is about transitions, movement, both to and from what we might recognize as our home shores.”We also looked back at a legacy and found insights for the future. Spanish artist Cecilia Giménez, who died this week at 94, left not just the world’s most beloved botched restoration, but also the remarkable lesson that what might seem like a mistake could turn into your life’s most beautiful surprise. That’s a bit of wisdom we can all lean into — including us thesis writers …And on we go. Thank you as always for reading. — Valentina Di Liscia, senior editor\nNewsPiet Mondrian, “Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow” (1930) (photo via Wikimedia Commons)Dozens of works of art, film, literature, and music entered the public domain on January 1, including a historic painting by Piet Mondrian and Betty Boop's debut appearance.

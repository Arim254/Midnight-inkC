    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tOctober 24th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you’ve made the jour­ney to Athens, you prob­a­bly took the time to vis­it its most pop­u­lar tourist attrac­tion, the Acrop­o­lis. On that mon­u­ment-rich hill, you more than like­ly paid spe­cial atten­tion to the Parthenon, the ancient tem­ple ded­i­cat­ed to the city’s name­sake, the god­dess Athena Parthenos. But no mat­ter how much time you spent amid the ruins of the Parthenon, if that vis­it hap­pens to have tak­en place in the past 200 years, you may now ques­tion whether you’ve tru­ly seen it at all. That’s because only recent­ly has scaf­fold­ing been removed that has par­tial­ly obscured its west­ern façade for the past two decades, result­ing in the pur­er visu­al state seen in the clips col­lect­ed above.\nThe press atten­tion drawn by this event prompt­ed Greece’s Min­is­ter of Cul­ture Lin­da Men­doni to declare this the first time the Parthenon’s exte­ri­or has been com­plete­ly free of scaf­fold­ing in about two cen­turies. Hav­ing been orig­i­nal­ly built in the fifth cen­tu­ry BC, and come through most of that span much the worse for wear, it requires inten­sive and near-con­stant main­te­nance.\nIts inun­da­tion by vis­i­tors sure­ly does­n’t help: an esti­mat­ed 4.5 mil­lion peo­ple went to the Acrop­o­lis in 2024, the kind of fig­ure that makes you believe in the diag­noses of glob­al “over­tourism” thrown around these days. The Greek gov­ern­men­t’s coun­ter­mea­sures include a dai­ly vis­i­tor cap of 20,000, imple­ment­ed in 2023, and a require­ment to reserve a timed entry slot.\nIf you’d like to see the whol­ly un-scaf­fold­ed Parthenon in per­son, you’d best reserve your own slot as soon as pos­si­ble: more con­ser­va­tion work is sched­uled to begin in Novem­ber, albeit with tem­po­rary infra­struc­ture designed to be “lighter and aes­thet­i­cal­ly much clos­er to the log­ic of the mon­u­ment,” as Men­doni has explained. But if you miss that win­dow, don’t wor­ry, since that oper­a­tion should only last until ear­ly next sum­mer, and upon its com­ple­tion, “the Parthenon will be com­plete­ly freed of this scaf­fold­ing too, and peo­ple will be able to see it tru­ly free.” Not that they’ll be able to see it for free: even now, a gen­er­al-admis­sion Acrop­o­lis reser­va­tion costs €30 (about $35 USD) dur­ing the sum­mer­time peak sea­son. Athena was the god­dess of wis­dom, war­fare, and hand­i­craft, not wealth, but it clear­ly lies with­in her pow­ers to com­mand a decent price.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Greeks Built Their Mag­nif­i­cent Tem­ples: The Art of Ancient Engi­neer­ing\nA 3D Mod­el Reveals What the Parthenon and Its Inte­ri­or Looked Like 2,500 Years Ago\nHow the Parthenon Mar­bles End­ed Up In The British Muse­um\nThe City of Nashville Built a Full-Scale Repli­ca of the Parthenon in 1897, and It’s Still Stand­ing Today\nArtist is Cre­at­ing a Parthenon Made of 100,000 Banned Books: A Mon­u­ment to Democ­ra­cy & Intel­lec­tu­al Free­dom\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom record-breaking droughts and catastrophic flash floods to contaminated pipelines and increasingly thirsty AI farms, water is at the nexus of the climate crisis. The life-giving liquid is both scarce and too abundant, causing half the global population to lack sustained access to fresh drinking water, while much of the world is subject to hotter, wetter weather that subsumes communities with extreme conditions.\nFor designer, author, and activist Julia Watson, pinpointing myriad approaches to these all-consuming problems is one of the most critical and urgent tasks today. Her new book Lo-TEK Water, published by Taschen, highlights various Indigenous technologies and aquatic systems that could be utilized in adapting to a climate-changed world. \nToby Harriman, Ye-chan Floating Islands of the Intha, Myanmar\nThere are the two-meter-deep canals of Xochimilco, Mexico, which delineate 55,000 square meters of raised fields called chinampas. While built by the Aztecs to clean the water and irrigate crops, this system actually originated with the Nahua people. Similar are the floating islands of Intha Myanmar, which weave together roots, leaves, sediment, and other materials to create hydroponic beds.\nAlthough Watson is keen to draw on ancient practices that could be more widely utilized today, she also highlights more modern approaches, like Pakistan’s Yasmeen Lari, an architect who’s responsible for devising the world’s largest program for creating shelters and cookware that leave no carbon footprint.\nAt 558 pages, Lo—TEK Water positions “water as an intelligent force that can shape resilient cities and landscapes. Aquatic infrastructure is reframed—from extractive and industrial into regenerative and evolving—designed to sustain life for generations,” a statement says.\nWatson is a key voice in the broader Lo—TEK movement, and this new book is a companion to her previous volume focused on sustainable technologies.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrea Gyorody at the Weisman Museum, with work by Elana Mann in background (photo by Ron Hall, courtesy Andrea Gyorody)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe director of an embattled university museum has resigned after artists accused the school administration of censoring an exhibition she curated. Andrea Gyorody stepped down as director of the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University, confirming to Hyperallergic that today would be her last day in the role.\nHer resignation comes three weeks after the university administration decided to alter two works it considered “political” that were on view in the group show Hold My Hand in Yours, curated by Gyorody. The school then shuttered the exhibition six months early after several artists requested that their work be withdrawn from the show in protest.\nMichael Friel, Pepperdine’s senior director of Communications and Public Relations, told Hyperallergic that Gyorody and the school had “mutually agreed” that she would step down. \n“The University thanks Dr. Gyorody for her leadership and contributions during her tenure,” the museum said.\nThe university had turned off Elana Mann’s video “Call to Arms 2015-2025” (2025), which documents 10 years of performances and protests featuring the artist’s arm-shaped megaphones. Administrators also turned over a small embroidered patch reading “Abolish ICE,” part of the large-scale collaborative sculpture “Con Nuestros Manos Construimos Deidades (With Our Hands We Build Deities)” (2023) by the group Art Made Between Opposite Sides (AMBOS).\n“Because Pepperdine’s established practice with the Weisman Museum has been to avoid overtly political content consistent with the University’s nonprofit status, it removed these two pieces from display,” a university spokesperson told Hyperallergic at the time.\nAfter the museum was shuttered, students, faculty, and alumni voiced their outrage. On Friday, October 17, faculty of the Fine Arts Division at Pepperdine’s Seaver College posted a statement affirming their “full and unwavering support for our students and their right to engage in creative inquiry without fear of censorship.”\n“As educators and scholars, we believe that the freedom to explore complex and challenging ideas is central to the mission of a Christian liberal arts education such as Pepperdine University,” the statement continued. “Suppressing artwork because it is perceived as ‘political’ undermines this mission and erodes trust in the academic process.”\n\nThe “Freedom Wall” at Pepperdine University, where community members posted anti-censorship messages (photo by and courtesy Grace Bidewell)\nOn the evening of October 9, about 100 students gathered for an art night, making posters and signs which were then posted to a “Freedom Wall” at the school’s student center. \nThe protest art will be used again next Wednesday, October 29, in a demonstration outside the Elkins auditorium, where faculty will be meeting to discuss recent events at the museum, according to Pepperdine senior Grace Bidewell. Mann said she plans to attend with her horns to amplify the students’ message. \nBidewell, an art and sustainability double major, told Hyperallergic that the alteration of the artwork was at odds with Pepperdine’s Christian mission. \n“It doesn’t align with their beliefs as a school. Christ had the view that all beings were created equal. Having artwork that respects that view shouldn’t be a problem,” Bidwell said.\nBryan C. Keene, a third-generation Pepperdine alum who also taught art history there and had his first art world job as a museum attendant at the Weisman, echoed those sentiments in an open letter to Pepperdine’s president and board on October 12. \n“The recent censorship of artworks at the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art represents a profound betrayal of Pepperdine’s academic mission, its Christian values, and its stated commitment to diversity and global leadership,” Keene wrote. \nHe also rejected the school’s argument that its nonprofit status prohibited the display of artwork with political content. “Displaying an artist’s work does not constitute institutional endorsement; suggesting otherwise reflects a profound misunderstanding of both art and education,” Keene said.\nGyorody became director of the Weisman in 2021, where she organized exhibitions on artists Hildur Ásgeirsdóttir Jónsson, Jeni Spota C., Isabel Yellin, and Karl Haendel. She was previously assistant curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, where she co-curated Afterlives of the Black Atlantic, which received a 2020 Award for Curatorial Excellence from the Association of Art Museum Curators. \n“It’s a huge loss for the Pepperdine community and the larger LA art community. She’s a brilliant curator, art historian, writer, and thinker,” Mann told Hyperallergic. “There’s a sadness amongst students and faculty, but I hope it will spark meaningful change as to who ultimately decides what will go into the museum.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMatt Stromberg is a freelance visual arts writer based in Los Angeles.

Organized in collaboration with White Cube gallery during Paris Art Week, Cai transformed the Pompidou’s façade into a fleeting, monumental painting, using his custom-built AI model to fuse art, technology, and pyrotechnics.\nCai’s destructive spectacles have often sparked controversy. His 2024 Los Angeles show caused distress among residents due to loud explosions, falling debris, and a blanket of smoke. The backlash escalated after Cai was commissioned by the outdoor brand Arc’teryx to stage a fireworks display titled “Rising Dragon” at an altitude of 18,000 feet on a mountain ridge in the Tibetan Himalayas this September. Despite the Canadian-founded and now Chinese-owned company’s claims that “biodegradable materials” were used and livestock relocated, the show was accused of causing damage to the vulnerable high-altitude ecosystem. Four Chinese officials were dismissed as a result. \n“Tibet is not a stage for corporate spectacle,” said Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) France, the group behind the Pompidou demonstration, in an email to Hyperallergic.  \n“What took place in Shigatse, Tibet, was not art, it was exploitation,” the group continued. “China’s occupation of Tibet continues to wreak havoc on Tibet’s fragile ecosystem. And by detonating over a thousand explosives on Tibet’s sacred land, Arc’teryx and Cai Guo-Qiang showed a deep disregard for Tibet’s fragile environment and its people.”\nActivists with Students for a Free Tibet France in front of Cai Guo-Quang’s fireworks display at the Centre Pompidou (photo courtesy SFT France)\nThe stunt ignited global outrage, particularly among Tibetan communities, who viewed it as a profound act of disrespect toward sacred mountains and local traditions, framing it as an indefensible act of cultural violence. \nArc’teryx issued an apology on Instagram, pledging to collaborate with Cai and their “team in China” to address the project’s “environmental and social impacts”. Cai also apologized on his studio’s WeChat account, acknowledging “oversights” in the project’s execution, while Chinese central government launched an investigation. \nHyperallergic has contacted Arc’teryx, Cai Guo-Qiang, White Cube Gallery, and Centre Pompidou for comment.\n\nA flyer accuses Centre Pompidou and White Cube of complicity in “environmental vandalism.” (photo courtesy SFT France)\nSince then, Tibetan activists from Students for a Free Tibet and allied advocacy groups have staged demonstrations at multiple Cai performances. Alongside this week’s protest at the Centre Pompidou, activists gathered outside White Cube London on September 25, chanting “Chinese art, Tibetan destruction!”  \nIn response to the London protests, action group Free Tibet said in a statement: “Art must never be used to mask injustice or celebrate the destruction of a repressed culture.”\nActivists argue that Cai’s fireworks commodify Tibetan culture and spirituality, turning sacred spaces into marketing spectacles. “Tibet is not a setting and spirituality is not a marketing product,” SFT France said in an Instagram post after the Pompidou action. “Art cannot be an excuse to destroy.”  \n\nTwo protesters hold up signs in front of Cai Guo-Quang’s fireworks display. (photo courtesy SFT France)\nGroups have also staged protests at other Paris museums, drawing attention to what they see as the erasure of Tibetan identity and heritage in major cultural institutions. Earlier this year, four pro-Tibetan groups in France filed a legal complaint against the Musée Guimet over the renaming of its Nepal-Tibetan galleries to the more generic “Himalayan World.” Activists argue the move effectively erases the existence of Tibet, aligning with China’s broader efforts to suppress Tibetan culture, history, and political identity.  \nLast year, protests erupted when the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris labeled its Tibetan artifact collection as hailing from the “Xizang Autonomous Region,” adopting a term used by the Chinese government in place of the more widely recognized “Tibet.” \n“We believe that true art uplifts, it does not destroy,” SFT France told Hyperallergic. “By offering its platform to Cai Guo-Qiang, the Centre Pompidou and White Cube are complicit of this environmental and colonial vandalism.”\nTashi Lahmu, national coordinator for Voluntary Tibet Advocacy Group UK, added: “We will continue to be a voice for those voiceless inside Tibet.”\n\n“Tibet is not a stage for corporate spectacle,” activists said.

    "body": "\nPARIS — “Too big to fail” is a term mostly used in finance, but the phrase came to mind more than once as I navigated the massive fourth edition of Art Basel Paris, featuring presentations from over 200 galleries through this Sunday, October 26. At a time when the art world is going through a “the market is dead, long live the market!” moment, the fair suggests strong demand for art at different entry points.\nThis doesn’t mean, of course, that the anxiety isn’t real. The frequently cited 2024 Art Basel and UBS Survey of Global Collecting reported sales slipping at the higher end of the market, raising worries about a vacuum not being filled by younger buyers. But there’s also been positive news as new collectors seem to be entering the market, though at lower and mid-ranges. The just released 2025 Art Basel and UBS Survey noted the market’s relative resilience after last year’s correction.\nSomewhat omnisciently, Alex Da Corte installed a giant, partly deflated balloon-statue, “Kermit the Frog, Even” (2018/2025), outside the Place Vendôme during Paris Art Week. The work “reveals our collective anxieties,” according to a label. Located in a posh address near the Grand Palais, surrounded by high-end shops and hotels from Chanel to the Ritz, this cheeky green muppet is losing air from within amid all the affably aged glitz.\nAlex Da Corte’s massive inflatable Kermit the Frog sculpture outside the Place Vendôme\nBut at the Grand Palais itself, there were fewer signs that the art world can take itself a little less seriously. The fair layout is unsurprisingly hierarchical, with blue-chip and established galleries occupying the ground floor, the Premise program featuring special projects in the back, and the Emergence section, introducing new artists and younger galleries, spread across second-floor.\nAs usual, the bigger galleries reported some staggering sales. Hauser & Wirth said it sold Gerhard Richter’s “Abstract Painting” (1987) for $23 million. White Cube gallery claimed it placed Julie Mehretu’s “Charioteer” (2007) for $11.5 million, while Pace said someone bought Amedeo Modigliani’s “Young Woman with Hair in Side Burns” (1918) for nearly $10 million. Other established galleries also reported strong sales: Lisson said it sold a Leiko Ikemura bronze for $800,000 and placed two of her paintings, and PPOW said the gallery sold out Kyle Dunn’s paintings, with overall sales totaling $700,000.\nA view of Art Basel Paris inside the Grand Palais on October 23, 2025\nThe fair’s outgoing director Clément Delépine, who will be succeeded by Karim Crippa, the current head of communications and senior art editor at Art Basel globally, after 17 years at the helm, opted for more exclusivity for the VIP Avant Première opening on November 20. Each exhibitor was allowed just six invitations.  The strategy paid off for the biggest dealers, but some galleries told me that it made for a slow opening day, with sales picking up only on day two.\nGiven that most young buyers enter the market at around $5,000, according to the latest Art Basel/UBS survey, it’s worth asking where one might find this work at the Grand Palais — and what the fair is like for the artists whose work is priced at this level. Not surprisingly, they were concentrated in the Emergence section. Hong Kong-based Bank Gallery showed yellow-themed fabric furniture and biology- wall designs and drawings by artist and designer Duyi Han (the drawings, ranging from $2,700 to $17,000, all sold, the gallery said). Exo Exo in Paris, which transitioned from an artist-run project space into a commercial one four years ago, showed balloons and small paintings by Ash Love, with images lifted from small digital screens (still unsold when we spoke). Also in this section, Cibrian, a gallery from San Sebastián, Spain, showed the only large-scale video art I saw at the fair, by Siyi Liu (also unsold).\n\nAsh Love with works at the booth of Exo Exo at Art Basel Paris\nThe predominance of painting, with a scattering of photography and sculpture, went unchecked throughout. Josèfa Ntjam, showing with London-based gallery Nicoletti Contemporary, often refers back to her Cameroonian ancestry, combining ancestral imagery and Afrofuturism. This is her second time at the fair, after taking part in Emergence last year; she is also in the São Paulo Biennial. “I work mostly in video and installation and have a really mixed-media practice. I feel my career really grew in London. In terms of institutional practices, there’s more responsiveness in the art scene in the UK than in France,” Ntjam said.\nThe gallery shared a booth with London-based Seventeen in a continuing trend of exhibitors economizing on fair fees while challenging themselves to offer cohesive presentations. Nicoletti said it sold one of the three sound sculptures by Abbas Zahedi,  “Serpent Hole on Serpentine Wall” (2025), featuring a metal snake head that can be activated to emit sound and a base that’s a piece of cut-out wall from Serpentine Gallery, among the few pieces I saw that played with the idea of disrupting or hacking (into) the art world.\nA Gentil Carioca’s booth at Art Basel Paris \nI found some of the most compelling booths in the Premise section, where carefully curated proposals provided a refreshing sense of visual cohesion next to the fair’s overstimulating medley. There were strong presentations by women artists across the fair — notably at A Gentil Carioca and Fortes D’Aiola Gabriel, both from Brazil, with works from established artists such as Leda Catunda, whose acrylic on velvet piece, “Gotas Coloridas” (1998), sold for $175,000, and newcomers like Camiz Agrade, whose acrylic painting, “Sollilquy” (2025), sold for $28,000.\nTina Kim Gallery’s booth with works by Lee Shinja\nTina Kim Gallery presented geometric textile works by Lee Shinja, a 95-year-old Korean artist who has a major retrospective at the Berkley Art Museum. Galerie Eric Mouchet, with spaces in Paris and Brussels, showed stunning Constructivist works by Ella Bergman-Michel, one of which, the gallery said, was acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Meanwhile, Düsseldorf-based Kadel Willborn presented minimalist photographs by Bauhaus artist Lucia Moholy, poignantly paired with a quietly poetic piece by Liz Deschenes made in response to Moholy’s work.\nNot all dealers can claim the successes reaped at the fair by the biggest galleries, and for new artists, visibility may not be matched by sales. As usual, blue-chip sales reports paint only a small part of the picture, but Art Basel Paris may have shown its ability to introduce under-discovered artists to new buyers.\n\t",

Emboldened by her enthusiasm, I broke the well-worn rule of not touching artworks and caressed the fleshy ceramics of Vietnamese artist Hà My Nguyễn. Inside the grand halls of La Monnaie de Paris, just steps from the Louvre, the fair’s mood remained undisturbed by the museum’s recent brazen heist, which has shaken the country. The crowd — international, multicultural, and sharply focused — reinforced the fair’s boutique reputation.\nRunning until October 26, and now in its 11th edition under the title GROW, Asia NOW brings together close to 70 galleries from 28 territories across Asia. The fair prides itself on a program curated in collaboration with institutions and curators from across the continent, such as the Lahore Biennale Foundation and COLOMBOSCOPE. It features installations and performances (mostly staged in the courtyards of La Monnaie), as well as children’s workshops and conversations.\n\nVisitors to the courtyard at the fair (photo Eurídice Arratia/Hyperallergic)\nAfter dropping into a talk between curator Sofía Lanusse, artist Sajid Wajid Shaikh, and gallerist Sahil Arora on emerging voices from South Asia, I made my way to Arora’s Method Art Space booth from Mumbai. A newcomer to the fair, Arora presented Indian and Pakistani artists under the banner We Were Always Neighbors. “Because of the political situation in India, we cannot show Pakistani artists in India, and vice versa in Pakistan,” he explained. “Paris is a good neutral ground for us to do so. People have been very curious about the presentation, and we’ve had conversations with a pretty mixed, cosmopolitan audience.”\nInterconnected by open-air courtyards, the fair is pleasant to navigate. Crossing the central court — partly overtaken by Lebanese artist Pascal Hachem’s “Threaded Whole” (2025), a grand assemblage of wooden furniture neatly sliced into cross-sections, later to be animated by dancers — I made my way toward the two tents housing around 30 galleries. This area includes a section entitled Now On, a grouping of galleries founded after 2015, where one could find plenty of prêt-à-porter works — small, pleasant pieces that filled the space without quite changing it. Though the layout and signage made it difficult to tell which artworks belonged to which stands at times, it did come with an upside. It encouraged impromptu conversations between visitors and gallerists — with even a few artists lending a hand — who seemed genuinely glad to talk.\n\nInstallation of work by Sumakshi Singh (courtesy 193 Gallery)\nArchitecturally, the galleries housed on the first floor fared better, benefiting from a clearer layout and the wow effect of their sumptuous, historical environs. The view of the Seine from the windows warded off the fair numbness that so often sets in amid endless rows of booths in enclosed spaces. Installed along the palatial staircase leading to the upper level is “I Will Never, I Also Like Ever” (2024) a two-channel video installation of levitating bodies by Sarah Brahim, while “Topographies of Belonging, Homeskins I to V” (2025) — a grouping of monumental columns made of burnt sand and paper fabric by Muhannad Shono — hung from the ceiling. The two Saudi Arabian artists are part of a section curated by Arnaud Morand that reflects the fair’s strong focus on West Asia this year.\nHighlights were to be found upstairs, too. Practically facing each other were the booths of Esther Schipper gallery, with a striking, color-saturated multimedia solo presentation by Cemile Sahin; Carlier Gebauer gallery, offering an elegant pairing of Egyptian artist Iman Issa and Filipino artist Maria Taniguchi; and Kaikai Kiki gallery from Tokyo, showing a series of delicate, small paintings depicting scenes of everyday life in Japan by Iori Nagashima. Nearby, the Madrid-based Sabrina Amrani Gallery captivated me with a tightly curated booth that introduced me to a few artists I’ll be keeping an eye on, including Manal Al Dowayan’s delicate yet politically charged acrylic contour paintings of women’s bodies, and Jong Oh’s ethereal spatial constructions that seemed to float in midair.\n\nCeramics by Hà My Nguyễn (photo Eurídice Arratia/Hyperallergic)\nI continued through the lateral salons and came across a standout at the booth for Seoul’s Arario Gallery. A highlight was “Lottery Village” (1998) by Kim Soun-Gui, a pioneering Korean-born, Paris-based artist, comprised of a charming doll-sized city built from cardboard, every façade painstakingly papered with discarded, brightly colored lottery tickets. (The work itself was much stronger than the accompanying overexplanatory press release, which framed it as a critique of capitalism — a claim as flimsy as the cardboard of the village.)\n\nGallerist Sahil Arora (photo Eurídice Arratia/Hyperallergic)\nAs a whole, the fair had more of a soft hum than a buzz, though conversations with gallerists suggested otherwise. “The fair has been very successful for us,” Sabrina Amrani, a seasoned participant, enthused. “We’ve sold works to a Malaysian foundation, a Swiss foundation, a Belgian foundation, and to collectors from Australia and Jakarta.”\nAfter hours of weaving through booths; trading impressions with artists, visitors, and gallerists; and listening on panels, it was time to leave. Near the door, I ran into Anissa Touati, one of the curators, whose earlier remark over coffee came to mind: “It’s a fair, it’s a festival, it’s a bank of ideas.” \n\nView of the tents from the first floor (photo Eurídice Arratia/Hyperallergic)\nCurators Anissa Touati and Shwetal Patel (photo Eurídice Arratia/Hyperallergic)\nSabrina Amrani gallery’s booth (photo courtesy Sabrina Amrani)\nInstallation view of work by Muhannad Shono (courtesy Asia NOW)\nArario Gallery booth with Kim Soun-Gui, “Lottery Village” (1999) (photo courtesy Arario Gallery)\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Design, History |   \tFebruary 13th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt does­n’t take too long a look at the almost sur­re­al­is­ti­cal­ly clean-lined build­ings of Wal­ter Gropius to get the impres­sion that the man want­ed to ush­er in a new world, espe­cial­ly when you con­sid­er that many of them went up before World War II. Take the Bauhaus Dessau build­ing, which, though com­plet­ed exact­ly a cen­tu­ry ago, looks like a con­crete trans­mis­sion from the future that nev­er arrived, or one that may indeed still be on the way. It once housed the Ger­man art school turned polit­i­cal and cul­tur­al engine he found­ed in 1919, whose prin­ci­ples includ­ed absolute equal­i­ty between male and female par­tic­i­pants — or they did at first, at any rate.\nSoon decid­ing that the new insti­tu­tion would­n’t be tak­en seri­ous­ly with too high a pro­por­tion of women, Gropius lim­it­ed their enroll­ment to one-third of the stu­dent body. That episode, among oth­ers that under­score the ways in which Gropius and the Bauhaus’ osten­si­ble com­mit­ment to the advance­ment of women was­n’t all it could be, fig­ures into Susanne Radel­hof’s doc­u­men­tary The Untold Sto­ry of Bauhaus Women.\nYet what­ev­er the short­com­ings in that depart­ment one might iden­ti­fy from a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry van­tage, the fact remains that the Bauhaus made pos­si­ble — or at least encour­aged — more endur­ing and influ­en­tial work by female artists and design­ers than almost any art school in ear­ly twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry Europe.\nAmong the almost 500 women who stud­ied at the Bauhaus, the film pro­files fig­ures like Alma Busch­er, “who cre­at­ed pro­to­types of avant-garde fur­ni­ture and toys”; “vision­ary met­al­smith and design­er” Mar­i­anne Brandt; Gun­ta Stöl­zl, whose “weav­ing rev­o­lu­tion­ized mod­ern tex­tile design” (weav­ing even­tu­al­ly being the main pro­gram to which women were admit­ted); Friedl Dick­er, a “mul­ti­tal­ent­ed artist” ded­i­cat­ed to the Bauhaus; and Lucia Moholy, whose “excep­tion­al pho­tographs still influ­ence how we view Bauhaus design today.” The school itself may have shut down in 1933, owing to the con­flict between its aes­thet­ic and polit­i­cal ends and those of the ris­ing Nazi Par­ty, but the for­ward-look­ing nature and world­wide cul­tur­al influ­ence of the Bauhaus have ensured that we still feel the influ­ence of its alum­ni, male and female alike.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Female Pio­neers of the Bauhaus Art Move­ment: Dis­cov­er Gertrud Arndt, Mar­i­anne Brandt, Anni Albers & Oth­er For­got­ten Inno­va­tors\nWatch Bauhaus World, a Free Doc­u­men­tary That Cel­e­brates the 100th Anniver­sary of Germany’s Leg­endary Art, Archi­tec­ture & Design School\nThe Pol­i­tics & Phi­los­o­phy of the Bauhaus Design Move­ment: A Short Intro­duc­tion\nThe Women of the Bauhaus: See Hip, Avant-Garde Pho­tographs of Female Stu­dents & Instruc­tors at the Famous Art School\nAn Oral His­to­ry of the Bauhaus: Hear Rare Inter­views (in Eng­lish) with Wal­ter Gropius, Lud­wig Mies van der Rohe & More\nThe Bauhaus Book­shelf: Down­load Orig­i­nal Bauhaus Books, Jour­nals, Man­i­festos & Ads That Still Inspire Design­ers World­wide\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n            New York politicians and activists hoisted a large Pride flag to the Stonewall National Monument’s flagpole on Thursday afternoon, February 12, in defiance of a federal directive to take down any flags or pennants that aren’t the United States flag or from the Department of the Interior.It takes a lot to get New Yorkers to stand outdoors in subfreezing temperatures for more than an hour, but the Trump administration’s onslaught on an iconic gay rights symbol in the West Village mobilized a crowd to Christopher Park.“Whose streets? Our streets! Whose park? Our park! Whose neighborhood? Our neighborhood!” chanted several hundred people, who spilled into Christopher and Grove streets.National Park Service (NPS) employees had quietly removed the rainbow Pride flag on Monday, almost exactly a year after scrubbing multiple references to transgender and queer people from descriptions on its website of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising and the birth of the modern LGBTQ+ movement. On Wednesday, federal employees reportedly installed a US flag on the pole where the Pride flag had flown.Crowds filled the park for the impromptu ceremony. (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)The move was part of the White House’s widespread campaign to whitewash American history in displays at museums and national historic sites, including the Smithsonian Institution and Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia.  But the agency’s decision to pull down the Pride flag prompted a swift backlash from Mayor Zohran Mamdani, Governor Kathy Hochul, and dozens of Democratic leaders across the city, who immediately vowed to return it to its rightful place.“Our city has a duty not just to honor this legacy, but to live up to it,” Mamdani tweeted on Tuesday. “I will always fight for a New York City that invests in our LGBTQ+ community, defends their dignity, and protects every one of our neighbors—without exception.”A Trans Pride flag is seen on the \"Gay Liberation\" sculpture by George Segal. (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)Three days after the flag’s removal, Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal organized an impromptu flag-raising ceremony at the site with nearly every elected official in Lower Manhattan, drawing several hundred activists and onlookers who spilled out onto Christopher, Grove, and West Fourth streets.Their plan was to attach the Pride flag on a smaller aluminum pole, carry it toward the permanent flagpole in the center of Christopher Park, and affix it to the flagpole with several black plastic zip ties.It did not go smoothly. “Why are the politicians up there and the people are back here?” one activist shouted. “History is not a f–ing photo-op!” another said.A temporary flag was raised by local politicians, only to be taken down moments later by activists, who put it on the permanent flagpole with the US flag. (photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A pair of activists approached the crowd of elected officials and had a brief discussion with them while some in the crowd chanted, “Raise the flag!” and “Do it proper!” The officials slowly retreated toward the Christopher Street side of the park while activists took several minutes to cut the zip ties and lower the US flag, before threading the Pride flag through the halyard that attached the American flag and raising them together. “I don’t know what happened,” Manhattan Assemblyman Tony Simone told Hyperallergic. “We didn’t want to take the US flag down. That wasn’t the goal. We wanted both of them side by side.”A half hour later, both flags waved vigorously in the wind, satisfying much of the crowd, which headed across the street to the Stonewall Inn for happy hour.Bronx-based artist and drag queen Timothy French poses at the Stonewall ceremony. (photo Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)Timothy French, a Bronx trans non-binary artist and drag queen, brought their own trans pride flag to the event. They told Hyperallergic that the Trump administration's attack on the gay pride flag was devastating, but nothing new.“Today there's more understanding within the LGBTQIA+ community, but as society, especially in areas throughout Middle America, they don't know trans people,” French said. “We're just 1% of the population, and there's that lack of real-life exposure, so you have conservative media, you have the religious leaders, and so on that are demonizing the trans community when they don't really even know what they're saying.”Before Trump’s second term, visitors to Christopher Park could sometimes find the Trans Pride flag flying alongside the Pride rainbow flag. But last year, caretakers were reportedly told that only the traditional rainbow flag, initially designed in 1978 by Gilbert Baker, was allowed.“It's just another way to erase people in society and their right to exist and live their lives,” French said.Some attendees raised handmade signs and chanted. (photo Aaron Short/Hyperallergic)Newly elected State Senator Erik Bottcher, who represented the West Village and led the City Council’s LGBTQIA+ caucus, said the monument and its history were too important to the community to let the Trump administration attempt to erase their significance.“When I was growing up in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains, I felt so alone, so hopeless, I didn’t want to be alive, but when I learned about Stonewall and its proud history, it gave me hope,” he told Hyperallergic.Hoylman-Sigal said it was important for all New Yorkers to celebrate the site of the birthplace of the LGBTQ+ rights movement.“I predict if [NPS] tries to take it down, we will return, but they may want to keep it up,” Hoylman-Sigal said.Hyperallergic has contacted the National Park Service for comment.Rhea Nayyar contributed reporting.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Stonewall\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Studio Ghibli’s PONYO debuts February 14 at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, which opened in 2021 with a Miyazaki retrospective. This show aims to convey the film’s whimsy and wonder while examining its profound significance through Miyazaki’s drawings and other elements behind its production.“He set out to do a simple film with a simple storyline for young children,” exhibition curator Jessica Niebel told Hyperallergic. “He achieved that, but Ponyo is also very multi-layered and complex.”Art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida are on view in the exhibition. (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)After creating films for a slightly older audience, such as Princess Mononoke (1997) and Spirited Away (2001), Miyazaki had younger children in mind with Ponyo, which was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Little Mermaid. In keeping with this, the sight lines of much of the exhibition are intentionally lowered, said Shraddha Aryal, executive VP of exhibitions at the Academy Museum. She and her team also designed interactive elements, such as a movable figure of Ponyo running across the waves and a large-scale green bucket based on the one that Sosuke keeps Ponyo in, which smaller visitors can crawl into.There is also an interactive animation table, featuring colorful sea-creature cut-outs designed by Studio Ghibli. Using their phone and an app, guests can rearrange squid, crabs, sharks, and a pufferfish to create their own stop-motion film.The show includes a large-scale green bucket, a reference from the film, which smaller visitors can crawl into. (© Academy Museum Foundation, photo by Emily Shur)To reference the organic forms of Ponyo’s nautical world, Miyazaki was adamant that only curved lines be used in the film’s animation. “Get rid of straight lines. Use gently warped lines that allow the possibility of magic to exist, liberating us from the curse of perspective drawing. A world where even the horizon swells, dips, and sways,” he intones from a wall panel in the exhibition. Aryal echoed this sentiment in the exhibition design, even fabricating circular frames for the watercolor and pastel art boards by Art Director Noboru Yoshida.Ponyo is significant in part because it was completely hand-drawn, a return to form after some computer animation was used in previous Ghibli films. The exhibition features over 100 objects donated by Studio Ghibli, including several drawings by Miyazaki, highlighting the analog aspect of the film’s creation. The works are staged around a modest wooden desk used by Ghibli animators.A wooden desk used by Ghibli animators (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)These objects, with their distinctly human traces, will perhaps be even more deeply appreciated by audiences today, amid an onslaught of digitally generated images often indistinguishable from reality. Studio Ghibli’s Ponyo is not an exhaustive cinematic overview of the film, but rather an evocative experience that channels some of its captivating enchantment. “The film has these moments of slowing down, contemplative, mesmerizing moments,” Niebel said, adding that the oversized bucket offers an entry point into this calm, cool world. “Originally, we wanted to make it a little smaller, and then our director Amy Homma asked, ‘What if adults want to crawl in, too?’”Installation view of Studio Ghibli’s PONYO at the Academy Museum (photo Matt Stromberg/Hyperallergic)\n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Los Angeles\n                      \n                      \n                        Studio Ghibli\n                      \n                      \n                        Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            The University of North Texas (UNT) abruptly shuttered an exhibition of works by Victor “Marka27” Quiñonez, whose practice centers the lived experience of immigrants in the United States and their inhumane treatment by federal agencies.Ni de Aquí, Ni de Allá — Spanish for “neither from here nor from there” — opened on February 3 and was slated to run through May 1 at the College of Visual Arts and Design (CVAD) Galleries in the UNT Art Building. Initially curated by Kate Fowle for Boston University Art Galleries, where it was on view for three months last year, the show notably included several works from Quiñonez's acclaimed I.C.E. Scream series — life-sized sculptures of paletas, or ice pops, that are both tributes to Latine immigrant culture and searing critiques of the violence inflicted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Certain pieces feature handcuffs or revolvers suspended in the transparent resin. Other works in the exhibition, including graffiti, paintings, and installations, touched on Quiñonez's Indigenous roots and street art background.

They sent him photos showing the gallery's distinctive glass windows covered with brown paper sheets, blocking the view inside. Mentions of the exhibition were scrubbed from the school's website. A few days later, on February 11, the artist received a four-line email from Stefanie Dlugosz-Acton, director of the CVAD Galleries.\"I am writing to let you know that the university has terminated the art loan agreement with Boston University Art Galleries for 'Ni de Aquí, Ni de Allá.' The university is making arrangements to return the exhibit to Boston University,\" read the email, reviewed by Hyperallergic. “Any activities associated with the exhibition are no longer necessary,” Dlugosz-Acton continued, concluding with the offer to reimburse Quiñonez for any travel expenses.The University of North Texas did not immediately reply to Hyperallergic's request for comment. The school has not issued a public statement about the exhibition closure. Via a representative, Kate Fowle, who curated the Boston iteration of the show, declined to comment.Victor “Marka27” Quiñonez with his installation \"Elevar la Cultura\" at SCOPE Art Show in Miami in December 2025 (photo Valentina Di Liscia/Hyperallergic)UNT's main campus is located in Denton, about 40 miles from East Dallas, where the Mexican-born artist grew up. In a phone call from Brooklyn, where he currently resides, Quiñonez said the show's cancellation hit him especially hard, given his own immigrant story and the surge of aggression under President Trump.“I saw my father get deported,” he said. “I've seen families and children being pulled away from each other in front of my eyes, in New York, in Texas. It's heartbreaking.”The exhibition, Quiñonez continued, was “about dual identity, about what it means to grow up in the US but also be from another country.”Ni de Aquí, Ni de Allá featured carefully rendered references to his community’s cultural footprint, from a bodega shelf lined with the tall devotional candles found in Latine and Caribbean households to a paleta cart in honor of street vendors. Since the start of Trump's second term, the administration has deported over half a million people inside the country and at the border. A record 73,000 individuals are being held in detention as of mid-January, many of them in dangerous and inhumane conditions, with reports of sexual abuse and physical torture.Quiñonez acknowledged that he was not given a reason for the exhibition's termination and could only speculate about the motive, but he suspects that it is part of an eerily familiar pattern of censorship against artists who speak out against the government. “It's been a trend in this country to suppress any kind of expression that's going against what this administration is doing to civilians and this regime that's been harming and murdering people,” Quiñonez told Hyperallergic. “They say ICE is supposed to be helping people, but detention centers are just another word for privatized prisons,” he continued. “My work speaks to the vulnerability of the communities affected by that.”A sign taped to the gallery windows on Thursday, February 12 (photo courtesy Narong Tintamusik)Parallel to its escalation in violence against immigrants and civilians, including deadly attacks by ICE and Customs and Border Protection in Minneapolis, the Trump administration has unleashed a campaign of repression in the cultural sector. Amy Sherald's withdrawal of an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution over fears that her portrait of a trans woman would be censored is a major example, but similar incidents have unfolded at institutions across the country, including universities. Last fall, a long-running exhibition of political art at East Tennessee State University was discontinued after a wave of right-wing backlash over works critical of conservative figures.Hyperallergic spoke to Narong Tintamusik, an adjunct teacher in the Drawing and Painting department, who said he was on his way to teach his 5 pm class on Thursday when he saw a sign haphazardly taped to a gallery window. “Victor Quiñonez is being silenced,” the sign read. When Tintamusik got out of class later that evening, the sign had been taken down, he said.“Censorship wasn’t new to me,” Tintamusik noted, recalling that last year, a pro-Palestine art exhibition at a UNT student gallery was partly dismantled following complaints from Republican state representatives.“As an educator, I think this is a good reminder for students about why they’re studying art in the first, and why they’re here,” Tintamusik said.UNT faculty began circulating a letter to the university's president and leadership on Friday, calling on the school to explain why the show was cancelled and to “reaffirm its commitment to academic freedom, artistic expression, and the public trust entrusted to it.”On its website, UNT proudly boasts being “one of the nation’s most diverse universities,” with 11,000 students — about a quarter of the student body — identifying as Hispanic, and one of just 22 universities federally designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the US. The decision to cancel the show, Quiñonez said, “shows that they don't think about how it affects them, and whether or not they feel supported and seen.”“What we need more than anything right now is for galleries and museums and institutions to step up and show important work that speaks to the challenges in our country,” Quiñonez said, “and to have the courage to exhibit that work and support the artists who are making it.”\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Texas\n                      \n                      \n                        Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\n                      \n                      \n                        University of North Texas\n                      \n                      \n                        Victor “Marka27” Quiñonez\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Economics |   \tFebruary 1st, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs men­tioned here last week, Scott Gal­loway argued that Amer­i­cans have one way to reverse the vio­lent over­reach of the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment: launch a one-month eco­nom­ic strike aimed at major tech and AI com­pa­nies, with the goal of reduc­ing Amer­i­ca’s GDP and mak­ing the mar­kets wob­ble. When the mar­kets gyrat­ed after “Lib­er­a­tion Day,” Pres­i­dent Trump imme­di­ate­ly rolled back many tar­iffs. Now, if Amer­i­cans can flex their eco­nom­ic mus­cles in Feb­ru­ary, Gal­loway wagers the admin­is­tra­tion will rethink whether it wants to keep arrest­ing jour­nal­ists and let­ting masked ICE agents shoot civil­ians in the streets—with impuni­ty.\nToday, Gal­loway has launched a new web­site, Resist and Unsub­scribe, that pro­vides an action plan for a month­long strike. In the “Ground Zero” sec­tion of the site, Gal­loway lists sub­scrip­tion ser­vices from America’s largest tech­nol­o­gy companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple, Net­flix, Ope­nAI, and Microsoft—and pro­vides links that let users unsub­scribe quick­ly. He also sug­gests hold­ing off on buy­ing new hard­ware and prod­ucts from these com­pa­nies (e.g. iPhones). If you use Feb­ru­ary to review your sub­scrip­tions and find ones to cut, you’ll clean up your per­son­al finances. You’ll also get the atten­tion of the major tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies that account for one-third of the S&P 500. When the tech CEOs get “yip­py,” so too will Trump.\nIn the “Blast Zone” sec­tion of Resist and Unsub­scribe, Gal­loway lists consumer‑facing com­pa­nies he has “iden­ti­fied as active enablers of ICE,” nam­ing AT&T, Com­cast, Lowe’s, Mar­riott, and Spo­ti­fy among oth­ers. He explains how these com­pa­nies sup­port ICE and rec­om­mends spe­cif­ic ser­vices you can can­cel or avoid. Scroll down the page to see these sug­ges­tions.\nVis­it Resist and Unsub­scribe, find some ser­vices to can­cel (it’s not a large sac­ri­fice), and spread the word. You can also find more infor­ma­tion about the Resist and Unsub­scribe move­ment on Gal­loway’s blog, “No Mercy/No Mal­ice.”\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nScott Gal­loway Explains How YOU Can Stop Gov­ern­ment Over­reach Using the Pow­er of Your Purse\nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tThe latest batch of documents released by the Department of Justice as part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act includes references to two leading art collectors, Steve Tisch and Jean Pigozzi. The DOJ’s library of documents have been added to over the past several days, with the latest update occurring on Saturday, January 31.\n\n\tThe documents, primarily in the form of emails sent around 2013, appear to show convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein connecting Tisch, a film producer and co-owner of the New York Giants, with multiple women. The news was first reported on by the Athletic.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tIn one email chain, from April 2013, which has the subject line “Ukrainian Girl,” Tisch asks Epstein if he knows any information about his “assistant’s friend,” who he recently had lunch with. Epstein replied that he “will get all the info,” with Tisch later saying “pro or civilian?” Epstein replies at one point, “civilian, but Russian, and rarely tells the full truth, but fun.”\n\n\tIn a different set of emails, from May 1, 2013, Tisch and Epstein correspond about meeting up that evening. At one point, Tisch writes, “Can I expect ‘trouble’?” Epstein replies, “I can invite the russian [redacted] to meet if you like?” Tisch writes back, “Is she fun?” Later in the chain, Epstein writes, “she is free after 1030 she said, you can meet her, you can come over first.”\n\n\tIn an email chain from May 15–16, 2013, Tisch asks a woman whose name has been redacted if she would be interested in meeting in Boston. Tisch doesn’t receive a reply and forwards the correspondence to Epstein, who replies, “she is traveling. not sure when she returns to florida. she is a micro biology major and is still in university, so i doubt that she could travel during the week, but we’ll see. you should also make it clear that you will orgaznie her ticket.” Tisch later writes back, “Never heard back from her / Oh well…”\n\n\tIn a 2017 email chain, Tisch writes to Epstein, asking how he is and that he hopes Epstein is “having a great Summer.” Epstein replied, “Come visit.” Other documents point to Tisch inviting Epstein to Giants games as well as other meetings over meals.\n\t\n\n\tIn a statement sent to the Athletic about his affiliations with Epstein, Tisch said, “We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.”\n\n\tTisch is also a major collector of contemporary art, having appeared on ARTnews’s Top 200 Collectors list from 2016 to 2024. A 2016 New York Times article revealed that he had created a 4,5000-square-foot private museum to host his collection in the backyard of his Los Angeles home. Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where Tisch is a trustee, curated the initial hang. In 2011, he also donated funds to help LACMA acquire Christian Marclay’s 24-hour video work The Clock (2010).\n\n\tPigozzi’s connections to Epstein are currently circulating online via a 2009 email between Epstein and publicist Peggy Siegal, in which Siegal writes, “Just left Ghislaine’s townhouse…after party for film.  Bill Clinton and Jeff Bezos were there…Jean Pigozzi, director Mira Nair…etc.”\n\n\tThe correspondence, also made in 2013, between Epstein and Pigozzi ranges from emails in which Pigozzi asks if Epstein is planning to visit the south of France that summer to emails where the discuss the appearance of different women. In the latter email chain, Pigozzi wrote, “I like the red head. Seem fun and smart.” Epstein replied, “german jew.” Pigozzi then replied, “I like her / No tits. Small problem / Did Leon like her ?” (Pigozzi appears to be referring to fellow art collector Leon Black, whose connections to Epstein have been well documented.)\n\t\n\n\tIn another email chain, Pigozzi responds to an email from Epstein in which he sent an image (the image is not reproduced in the file): “Looks amazing / Can’t see any girls ???”\n\n\tThe documents also include a 2010 email chain between Pigozzi and “Gmax,” most likely Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime associate who was convicted of child sex trafficking in 2021. “Gmax” asks Pigozzi if he is planning to sell his properties in Panama and France, adding “If so price. Have potential interested party”; Pigozzi asks for a phone call before writing that the France property is 22.5 acres and that it “MUST BE OVER EURO 300M,” while for the Panama property, his asking price would be “OVER $ 150 M  JUST THE ISLAND 270 ACRES.”\n\n\tIn a phone call, Pigozzi told ARTnews that he did not remember any correspondence between him and Epstein about a “red head.” Regarding the prices for his Panama and France properties, he said he was not interested in selling it at the time, adding “I gave him some ridiculous price.”\n\n\tOf his connections with Epstein, Pigozzi said, “I never had anything to do with him and girls. Zero. Nothing. I also regret that I met him and Ghislaine.”\n\n\tPigozzi told ARTnews that he found his work in the art world a more interesting topic of conversation than “these stupid emails. I don’t find it so fascinating.” Pigozzi is a major collector of African art, with a focus on photography from the continent. He first started collecting in 1989 after seeing the Centre Pompidou’s influential “Magiciens de la Terre” exhibition that year.\n\t\n\n\tIn the decades since, he has amassed thousands of works from more than 160 artists from 22 sub-Saharan African countries, according to the collection’s website. The collection is currently based in Geneva but does not have a permanent exhibition space, though he told ARTnews he is currently at work building a space in Cannes.\n\n\tIn 2019, Pigozzi donated 45 works of contemporary African art to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The gift included pieces by Seydou Keïta, Romuald Hazoumè, Bodys Isek Kingelez, Moké, Chéri Samba, Ambroise Ngaimoko/Studio 3Z, and Frédéric Bruly Bouabré. At the time, MoMA called the donation “transformative” as it would make the museum “a unique institutional leader in this aspect of contemporary African art.”\n\n\tPigozzi’s holdings include dozens of photographs by Keïta, many of which are currently on view in a survey of the late photographer’s work at the Brooklyn Museum. The Jean Pigozzi African Art Collection is specifically thanked in the exhibition’s credits.\n",

    "body": "\n\tPat Oleszko has been making a fool of herself full time for 60 years. Known for her satirical wit, surreal costumes, and performances in and around immense inflatables, the artist defies easy categorization. Using her body as the armature for a unique sort of walking, talking “pedestrian art,” Oleszko has inhabited incendiary and far-flung guises including a rapacious Coat of Arms(1972), a robed and miter-clad Nincompope (1999), and, in recent years, a caricature of Dumpty Trumpty (2018). For Oleszko, the performance never stops and the costume’s never off, whether on the street or onstage, nude or covered from head to toe.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe upstart Midwesterner spent her formative years in the 1960s at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, then a crucible of experimental time-based art. In that milieu, she brushed shoulders with Andy Warhol, listened to lectures by visitors from Claes Oldenburg to the Velvet Underground, and went to performances collectively staged by the ONCE Group, Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage, and Judson Dance Theater. Realizing that she could express her ideas in the way she presented herself in the everyday, her wardrobe exploded to fit all occasions, and she began making appearances at ONCE Group events and the Ann Arbor Film Festival. \n\n\tWhen Oleszko moved to New York in 1970, an art world gripped by Minimalism and Conceptual art didn’t quite know what to make of her subversive humor and ostentatious getups. She created her own opportunities to perform, walking city streets in absurd attire and infiltrating Thanksgiving and Easter Day parades. Before long, she got invitations to exhibit and perform at the Museum of Modern Art, the Kitchen, P.S. 122, and the Whitney Museum. \n\n\tNow, at the age of 78, Oleszko is being recognized by two New York bastions of contemporary art: the Whitney Biennial and SculptureCenter, the latter of which is presenting (through April 27) the artist’s first institutional solo exhibition in the city in more than 35 years. A.i.A. spoke with Oleszko about her multidisciplinary trajectory and flirtations with the absurd.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tView of Pat Oleszko’s 2026 exhibition “Fool Disclosure” at SculptureCenter, New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharles Benton\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYour practice originated in over-the-top costumes. How has it shifted scope and format over the years?\n\t\n\n\tIn the beginning, the costumes were a kind of octopussian exploration of anything that I found attractive, challenging, or comment-worthy. I was always wearing the inside of my head on the outside of my body. There was no name for performance art when I started working. There were artists doing events that responded to “happenings.” But I needed to discover what I was doing, using my body as the platform for experimentation. I did everything with my costumed personas. The world is my stage. The world is my stooge. \n\n\tI street-walked, joined protests and parades, attended parties. I did time-based events. I made performances on film. I entered a striptease contest and beauty contests like Miss Subways and Miss Polish America. I waitressed at Max’s Kansas City and the St. Adrian Company, and every night I costumed so that people would come in just to see who I was that evening. I also did burlesque, which was another means of discovering what to do with wearable sculptures—to take things off, put things on, become a character. At some point, I started using my works as illustrations, calling them “visual editorials.” Those have been in Artforum, Esquire, Ms., Oui, Penthouse, Playboy, and even Sesame Street Magazine and National Geographic. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko: Coat of Arms, 1973.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Neil Selkirk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIs there a medium you’ve come to identify with most strongly? \n\t\n\n\tThey’re meshed together in the great Osterizer in the sky. But I’m a sculptor, essentially, who makes work that lives, breathes, walks, farts, and fucks. My body is the expression of the initial idea. The work’s never separated from myself. I’m its vehicle. It was a big deal when I could finally let other people wear my costumes, which were so much a part of my journey of finding out who I was.\n\n\tHow did your disparate activities begin to cohere into longer performances?\n\n\tIn 1976, I had the opportunity to do an evening-length piece at the Museum of Modern Art. I had no idea how to do that at first, but I started stringing things together. The performances weren’t necessarily propelled by a storyline, but they focused on ideas that I’d hit at in lots of different ways. Once I could perform on a stage, I started to do shows at the Kitchen, P.S. 122, and places across Europe. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko: Patty Cake, 1972.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Neil Selkirk\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhat did you learn from your time working in burlesque?\n\n\tI did that off and on, so to speak, for a couple of years in college as “Pat, the Hippie Strippy.” It was an enormously informative and inspiring subculture that was on its way out—the last vestiges of vaudeville. They had comedians at the theater where I worked who would do acts with the girls, making all these double and triple entendres that I, of course, loved.\n\t\n\n\tDid that impact your pacing and sense of narrative? The multiact structure of your performances parallels that of vaudeville or variety shows.\n\n\tIn the variety show, there’s a new act every five minutes. I adopted that and manipulated it into my own thing. As the only person onstage, I’d multiply myself and turn different parts of my body—fingers, knees, butt, breasts, and pussy—into smaller characters.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko: Womb with a View, 1990.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tListening to an artist talk you gave in the ’80s, I was struck that it had the cadence of standup comedy. How did you arrive upon humor as a strategy? \n\n\tAs an artist, you’re compelled to work in ways both instinctive and intellectual. I have a definite theatrical bent, ranging from comedy to tragedy. My muse is a-muse. And I’m constantly amused by what the human animal does in pursuit of acceptance. The people I admire—Buster Keaton, Lewis Carroll, Jacques Tati—were brilliant at pointing out the foibles of society, the wonder of man as a barely thinking animal. That’s what propels me. I see inadequacies that I want to point out or correct. I do so through absurdity, which mostly happens to be funny, though sometimes it’s not. It’s a double whammy. You can laugh at something and then think, “Oh, jeez, what was I laughing at? She was talking about the end of the world.” \n\t\n\n\tYou’re like a court jester, given license to say bad things. \n\n\tYou get credibility if you’re a fool. You can say things, do things, manipulate things. I’m often making statements about topics that I want people to pay closer attention to—climate change, women’s rights, politics, and inequity and absurdity wherever I see it. \n\n\tYou’ve described your work as a kind of sociological experiment. You enter environments as a catalyzing event. How do people react? \n\n\tIt depends on the situation, the costume, and what level I’m operating on. Is it a critique or not? Sally Sex-retary (1971) can have 500 men following her down Wall Street in an absurd costume—you know, all tits and ass. Or I can walk out onto the street in my neighborhood and not get any response. There are some outfits that you can’t not look at. Every pair of eyeballs sees me, follows me from the minute I leave the house to the minute I escape. It’s very demanding to be the center of attention, with no place to hide. As the fool, I’ve taken it on as my burden. I’m not going out unless I’m ready to be a peacock, to complement the situation, to disturb things. \n\n\tMany of your installations and performances incorporate inflatables that you design and construct yourself—a Grecian temple, an astronaut, the legs and feet of the Wicked Witch of the West. What first gave you the idea to work with inflatables?\n\t\n\n\tI saw something that could blow up in a coffee shop and said, “Oh, I can make inflatable things, only I’ll make them a little larger than that.” It became a way for me to make big sculptures, which was one of the problems that I had been trying to solve by using my body as an armature. It took me a little while to figure out the air, the right fabric, and how I could actually use them in a performance. I began to inhabit them, using their interior and exterior spaces. They were great onstage. You could inflate one in a minute. It was this kind of surprise, or organic magic. Then you unzip it and boom, it’s gone. That’s one of the beauties of the inflatables—there’s no there there.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPat Oleszko as the Nincompope in the performance Roamin’ Holiday: A View from a Broad, 1999.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto  Craig Verzone\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHow does it feel to have both a solo exhibition up at SculptureCenter and work in the Whitney Biennial?\n\n\tIn the Whitney Biennial, I’m showing a giant inflatable. I’m usually a pedestrian-size sculpture, but I just might have the tallest and smallest pieces in the show! The exhibition at SculptureCenter—“Fool Disclosure”—is a survey concentrating on the sculptural works. When they asked, I said, “I’m going to jam as many inflatables in as I can.” It expanded to include films, hats, and some of my really early works. There’s also a catalog, which includes more than 100 names that I came up with for the exhibition. My partner suggested “Pat Oleszko: Nice Hair.” I’ve been telling everybody—everybody!—that I’m going to be in two institutions at the same time. Someone worried, “She’s institutionalized in two places?!”\n\t\n\n\tThat’s also a good title. “Pat Oleszko: Institutionalized.”\n\n\tI’ll add it to the list. \n",

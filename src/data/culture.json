    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tNovember 14th, 2025  4 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEvery­one in ancient Rome wore togas, sur­round­ed them­selves with pure-white mar­ble stat­ues, bayed for blood as glad­i­a­tors fought to the death in the Colos­se­um, pro­gram­mat­i­cal­ly imi­tat­ed the Greeks, and, after each and every debauch­er­ous feast, excused them­selves to the vom­i­to­ria, where they rit­u­al­ly vacat­ed their stom­achs. Or at least that’s the pic­ture any of us here in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry might piece togeth­er out of the impres­sions we hap­pen to receive from a steady flow of sword-and-san­dals movies and TV shows — not to men­tion the count­less ref­er­ences that pop­u­lar cul­ture makes to the Roman Empire, which inevitably make their way into the con­scious­ness even of those of us who don’t think about it every day.\nIn the new, almost 80-minute Big Think inter­view above, Mary Beard explains some of the ways in which we’ve been “pic­tur­ing ancient Rome all wrong.” The ancient Romans lived in a world in which men kissed each oth­er as a stan­dard greet­ing (at least until a mas­sive out­break of her­pes put a stop to it it), stat­u­ary was paint­ed in all man­ner of gar­ish col­ors (though just how gar­ish remains a mat­ter of schol­ar­ly inquiry), cit­i­zens rich enough to wear togas need­ed the assis­tance of slaves even to get dressed in the morn­ing, and Greece took cul­tur­al influ­ence as well as gave it. These may not yet be fea­tures of the Rome we imag­ine, but they could be if we make a habit of lis­ten­ing to Beard’s new pod­cast Instant Clas­sics.\nWhat­ev­er lib­er­ties they take, the depic­tions of the Roman Empire that enter­tain us today also remind us that, as Beard puts it, “Rome has nev­er gone away in the mod­ern world.” Nowhere is that clear­er than in ever-more-fre­quent dis­cus­sions about the fate of mod­ern glob­al pow­ers. If we look at our sur­round­ings and see Rome, per­haps that’s because the Eter­nal City has “giv­en us an image of what it is to be pow­er­ful, what it is to be larg­er than life, what it is to be fun­ny, what it is to be an empire, so it’s pro­vid­ed many of the build­ing blocks we need to think about our­selves.” Even if we’re not the mod­ern equiv­a­lents of Augus­tus, Vir­gil, Cicero, or even Nero — to name a few of the Romans Beard name as, for bet­ter or worse, the most impor­tant — we could all stand to make our image of Roman life a lit­tle more real­is­tic.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEmpire With­out Lim­it: Watch Mary Beard’s TV Series on Ancient Rome\nMythol­o­gy Expert Reviews Depic­tions of Greek & Roman Myths in Pop­u­lar Movies and TV Shows\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for addressing issues of censorship and inequality, Iranian artist Arghavan Khosravi (previously) has long utilized her bold, fragmented works to confront large-scale problems relevant around the world. Her alluring color palettes and delicate motifs catch the eye and are paired with distinct symbols of tension: a chain lock, cords binding body parts, and roiling flames.\nWhile her concerns are global, Khosravi has always considered her practice somewhat of a balm that helps her cope with trying times. And so the inward turn of her latest body of work perhaps ventures farther into this territory as she allows herself to delve deep into a personal and collective subconscious.\n\nThe past year has engendered a period of introspection, which the artist translates into a collection of smaller, altar-esque pieces. She refers to them as “intimate constructions where interior space carries its own symbolism. It’s been a way to move inward for a moment, allowing ideas to surface without a predetermined destination.” \nBoth the subconscious and symbolic have long figured prominently in her work, and recent pieces are similar. Many layer seemingly disparate components into surreal scenes, with recurring imagery of long, flowing hair, bright orbs of light, birds, and patterns from historic Persian architecture and design. Whereas earlier works frequently incorporated windows, doorways, and other portal-like structures, Khosravi’s newer pieces peer outward from inside, inviting the viewer into a new realm.\nThe artist is in the early stages of preparing for an upcoming solo show at Uffner & Liu in New York next year. Until then, follow her practice on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLi Songsong (previously) has long centered his practice around translating archival imagery, whether it be a portrait printed in a newspaper or still from a film. The Chinese artist is broadly interested in the ways that memories morph over time and how, when we’re reflecting on a moment well in the past, our clarity over the particulars can be hazy.\nHis new body of work, History Painting, takes a similar technical approach, although rather than interpret a specific scene, Li ventures into the abstract. Wide, impasto layers of oil paint cloak the large-scale canvas, creating a cacophony of color and texture that seems to swell upward while simultaneously pulling downward. As a filmed studio visit shows, the artist works from top down, adding one thick mark atop another in a sort of grid. \n“History VII: Snake Year” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nPace Gallery, which represents Li, shares that History Painting reflects more on his relationship to the medium than any specific visual source, although, given his past work, it’s difficult not to try to find definition within the composition. The clustered ridges of paint, for example, might evoke bodies huddled together in mass, their backs to the viewer as they move toward an unknown destination. For Li, these brushstrokes, while abstract, do retain a sense of action and autonomy, and he describes them as “agentive and idiosyncratic” even as they’re covered again and again.\nHistory Painting is on view through December 20 in New York.\n“Revolution” (2025), oil on canvas, 210 x 210 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n“History IX: Mercy” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\n“History IV: Sacrifice” (2025), oil on canvas, 120 x 120 centimeters\nInstallation view of ‘Li Songson: History Painting’ (2025)\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAfter six momentous leaps from a small aircraft, skydiver Gabriel C. Brown completed his mission. Brown is friends with astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy and now, also one of his collaborators. Together, the pair created a stunning image that shows the adventurous subject falling in front of the sun.\nMcCarthy is known for his incredible patience and planning, which has led him to capture an array of striking photos and composites detailing cosmic phenomena. This most recent piece, titled “The Fall of Icarus,” details the roiling, fiery surface of the sun with his friend’s upside-down silhouette. The pair undertook this project this past weekend in Arizona.\n\nLike much of his work, this image is a composite that stitches together a collection of high-resolution captures. McCarthy and Brown had to coordinate the jump and subsequent shots to reveal the latter’s free fall, footage of which they share on Instagram. \n“The Fall of Icarus” is available as a limited-edition print in McCarthy’s shop, where you can find more of his work.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInstallation view of Kara Walker, “Unmanned Drone” (2023) in  MONUMENTS at  at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (photos Claudia Ross/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nLOS ANGELES — “Someday,” Confederate sympathizer and sculptor Frederick Wellington Ruckstuhl once remarked, “I will make a monument that will express the verdict of history.” \nThe quotation appears alongside Ruckstuhl’s 1903 work, “Confederate Soldiers and Sailors,” in the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA) and arts nonprofit The Brick’s long-awaited exhibition, MONUMENTS. The two-part show displays decommissioned public Confederate statues — Ruckstuhl’s, now splattered in red paint by protesters, was toppled in 2017 following Charlottesville’s violent Unite the Right rally — alongside (or within) commissions by contemporary artists and other selected artworks. \nRuckstuhl’s phrase reflects the problematic double bind of early 20th-century Lost Cause mythology, a belief system that downplayed slavery’s importance in the Civil War, both anticipating and deferring the Confederacy’s vindication. It also provides an oddly apt framing for the exhibition itself, which expertly captures America’s shifting political terrain and the role of art within it. Originally planned for the end of Biden’s first (and, likely, only) term, the exhibition once seemed poised to mark a national reckoning with slavery’s legacy. Instead, due to institutional logistics and security concerns, it arrives during Trump’s second, when several Confederate monuments have already been reinstated. Fittingly, MONUMENTS evokes a world where historical verdicts, especially noble ones, remain out of reach — but, through poetic, thoughtful installation, chief curators Bennett Simpson, Hamza Walker, and Kara Walker manage to find life in limbo.\nInstallation view of Abigail DeVille, “Deo Vindice (Orion’s Cabinet)” (2025), china cabinets, charcoal, rusted steel scaffolding, pig blood, salt, mud, lights, and natural fiber\nArtful pairings negotiate the exhibition’s difficult premise with ease, neither inadvertently valorizing Confederate history nor tritely dismissing slavery’s ongoing legacy. A single immersive installation by Abigail DeVille dominates the exhibition’s only second-floor gallery: “Deo Vindice (Death’s Cabinet)” (2025) features a sweeping array of charred colonial cabinets and furniture, their eerie assemblage inspired by images of burned homes in Richmond, Virginia, during the Civil War. In the bunker-like first-floor room directly below plays Julie Dash and Davóne Tines’s music video project “HOMEGOING” (2025). Filmed partially in Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church, where White supremacist Dylann Roof shot nine Black parishioners in 2015, the video cuts between scenes of the present-day church, where Tines and Black activists perform the gospel song “This Little Light of Mine,” and shots of Charleston’s 400-year-old Angel Oak Tree, a landmark older than the country itself. When seen with DeVille’s scorched sculpture above, the “light” of “HOMEGOING” seems abundantly powerful — even fiery — and almost unbearably tragic, as though American history were collapsing in one explosive space. \nNearby galleries stage similarly insightful collisions, this time between decommissioned monuments and contemporary artworks. One room adjacent to Tines and Dash’s film displays selections from Andres Serrano’s 1990 photo series The Klan, in which Ku Klux Klan members pose against dark backdrops, simultaneously illuminated through bright flash and obscured by their hooded uniforms. In the same room, Edward V. Valentine’s 1907 sculpture of Confederate president Jefferson Davis lies on its side, dripping in pink paint. Together, these artworks explore the complex visibility and persistence of White supremacy — but here, its symbols feel newly exposed and vulnerable, too. In another pairing, Laura Gardin Fraser’s hulking 1948 monument of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson faces Hank Willis Thomas’s “A Suspension of Hostilities” (2019), in which a towering replica of “General Lee” — the bright orange, Confederate-flag-emblazoned Dodge Charger from the TV show The Dukes of Hazzard — is flipped downward, colliding headfirst with the museum floor. \n\nInstallation view of Monuments\nInstallation view of Edward V. Valentine, “Jefferson Davis” (1907), bronze\nWhat does the Confederacy’s present look like? Several miles from MOCA, The Brick displays Kara Walker’s standout “Unmanned Drone” (2023), a deconstruction and reassembly of Charles Keck’s 1921 equestrian monument to Stonewall Jackson. The resulting artwork is a surreal hybrid of horse and rider — an amalgam of armor, limbs, and weapons — as though time has reshuffled the monument’s original structure into an even more grotesque, inhuman fighter. (The title references contemporary autonomous warcraft, which have been used in Russia, Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere.) In Cauleen Smith’s sprawling multimedia installation “The Warden” (2025), the “Vindicatrix,” a female statue that once stood atop Richmond’s Jefferson Davis monument, faces a black gallery corner. A CCTV camera points at her outstretched hand, a gesture that, in Lost Cause mythology, signifies the Confederacy’s eventual reprisal. The camera livestreams her pointing finger onto TVs scattered across the exhibition, where they implicate the viewer in the Vindicatrix’s quest: These ominous hands appear, at first glance, almost like wayfinding markers, guiding the viewer through entryways and corridors.\nJust inside MOCA’s doors is a metal detector flanked by two guards. Though it’s not an official artwork in the exhibition, it may as well be — the heightened security for the exhibition serves as a bracing reminder of how the material on view may still embolden White supremacists today. Luckily, this project also empowers artists. Near the entrance are piles of bronze ingot bars melted from Robert E. Lee’s Charlottesville monument, stacked like gold at a bank, alongside slag and a granite fragment from the monument. Their weighty presence speaks volumes about America’s economic foundation in slavery — but an accompanying text notes that what’s on view is only the material for a future artwork, and not the piece itself. Later, these relics will play a role in another new commission. History, after all, hasn’t reached its verdict yet. \n\nInstallation view of Monuments, featuring a monument by Frederick William Sievers in the foreground\nInstallation view of Monuments featuring works by Laura Gardin Fraser (left) and Hank Willis Thomas (right)\nMONUMENTS continues at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (152 North Central Ave, Los Angeles) and The Brick (518 North Western Avenue, Los Angeles) through May 3, 2026.

Yes, the autocracy is out in the open, but don't be fooled into thinking that it's all transparent. A lot of evil is still hidden from the public eye. That's where independent journalism, like what you're reading here, comes into the picture. Our stories this week investigate the intersections of power and image-making, asking who benefits from this potent mix. The visual lexicon of the No Kings movement, figure models and museum employees fighting for better working conditions, artists mired in debt, NYC Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani pulling a Marina Abramović at a museum in Queens, and the emergence of \"Crusadercore\" — these are just a few of the offerings in this edition.      I can't tell you how much we've been enjoying working on our revamped community columns. Art Movements covers industry news from an art worker's perspective. Art Problems answers your common career questions. Required Reading recaps the best and smartest reads around the internet. In Memoriam gives thoughtful portraits of community members we've lost. And in A View From the Easel, a personal favorite, artists reflect on their workspaces and practices. The next featured studio could be yours, by the way. Read the column to learn how to apply.         And make sure you also check out our Best of 2025 lists. This week, we rounded up our favorite art films of the year, plus outstanding exhibitions we've seen around the world. Alongside our team, contributors include Aruna D'Souza, Carolina A. Miranda, John Yau, Seph Rodney, Alex Paik, and other prominent critics.\n\n                            But we need your help to keep this publication thriving. Social media and AI companies are shamelessly ripping off our content and ad revenue is not enough to cover all of our costs. We're just a few hundred people away from our goal of 8,000 members by the end of the year. You'll make a big difference to our work as an independent art publication if you join us now.

    "body": "\n\tRobert Mnuchin, the Wall Street pioneer who became one of New York’s most respected art dealers and a fixture at blue-chip auctions, died on Friday at his home in Bridgewater, Connecticut. He was 92. His death, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by his stepdaughter, Lisa Hedley Wick. \n\n\tMnuchin was unusual in having two long and highly successful careers. At Goldman Sachs, he was a central figure in the rise of block trading in the 1960s and ’70s, helping build the firm’s institutional equities business under managing partner Gustave Levy. By 1978, the Wall Street Journal described him as “the acknowledged dean of block traders,” rivaled only by Salomon Brothers’ Michael Bloomberg. His skill on the trading floor—an encyclopedic recall of buyers and sellers, an instinct for pressure and timing—made him a legend inside the firm. He became a partner in 1967, co-headed trading and arbitrage by 1976, and joined the firm’s powerful management committee in 1980. He retired in 1990. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThat same set of instincts—competitive, analytic, and deeply interpersonal—animated his second act. After decades on Wall Street, Mnuchin did something that surprised even close friends: he left finance to open a gallery. It was not a move financiers of his stature typically made. As he later told ARTnews, it “took a lot of courage” to step away from the Goldman machine and test whether his success came from his own abilities or the institution behind him. “I wanted to see what I could do on my own,” he recalled. And because no museum would hire someone without a formal art background, “the only alternative was to start my own gallery, which is what I did.” \n\n\tHe and his wife, Adriana, converted part of their East 78th Street townhouse into C&M Arts (partnering with James Corcoran) in 1992, later partnering, with Dominique Levy in L&M Arts. He would establish Mnuchin Gallery, on his own, in 2013. From the start, the gallery had a clear identity: rigorous, museum-quality exhibitions focusing on the pillars of postwar American art—Pollock, Rothko, Kline, de Kooning—as well as major presentations of Alexander Calder, Donald Judd, Jeff Koons, Frank Stella, Philip Guston, Sam Gilliam, Ed Clark, and David Hammons. He staged eight exhibitions devoted to Willem de Kooning alone, calling the artist “Picasso-esque” for the breadth of his distinct periods. \n\t\n\n\tMnuchin’s passion for exhibitions—and his conviction that art should be lived with—shaped both his gallery and his own collecting. “The reason to buy art is because you love it, you love it, you love it,” he told the New York Times in 2013. He disliked the term “collection,” insisting that he and his wife kept everything they bought in their home, never in storage. \n\n\tHe became equally known for his presence in the auction room. At evening sales, he was a calm but relentless bidder—sometimes shouting out prices or jumping ahead in increments to secure a work. In 2019, wearing a cream-colored jacket and armed with a flip phone, he set a record for a living artist when he placed the winning $91.1 million bid for Jeff Koons’s Rabbit (1986), acting on behalf of an anonymous client widely believed to be hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen. His bidding style—patient, unshowy, decisive—made him a recognizable figure even for those who didn’t know his long résumé. \n\n\tThough he was the father of Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, Robert Mnuchin largely avoided politics and was described by colleagues as modest, disciplined, and deeply devoted to art. Friends and art-world peers often noted his integrity: Amy Cappellazzo, the former Sotheby’s chairman, once called him “one of the straightest shooters in the business.” \n\t\n\n\tRobert Elliott Mnuchin was born on September 5, 1933, in Manhattan. His father, Leon A. Mnuchin, was a lawyer and longtime director at several retail companies. The family collected works by Franz Kline and Mark Rothko—and, as he liked to note, once owned a forged Matisse. He grew up on Central Park West before the family moved to Scarsdale. He attended Scarsdale High School, graduated from Yale in 1955, and served briefly in the Army before joining Goldman Sachs. \n\n\tMnuchin married Elaine Terner in 1957; they had two sons, Steven and Alan. After their divorce, he married Adriana Graber, with whom he had a daughter, Valerie. In addition to his wife, daughter, and sons, he is survived by his stepchildren Lisa Hedley Wick and Bradley Abelow. \n\n\tMnuchin worked well into his later years, even as he faced mobility challenges. He skipped Art Basel in Basel for the first time in two decades in 2019, but continued to remain at the gallery’s exhibitions and for major sales. “I love what I do,” he said in the 2021 ARTnews interview. “I’d be lost without it.” \n",

    "body": "\n\tArnulf Rainer, the Austrian artist whose relentless drive for experimentation made him a key figure of Europe’s postwar scene, died on December 18 at 96 at his home in Austria. His death was confirmed by his gallery Thaddaeus Ropac.\n\n\tBorn in Baden, Austria, in 1929, Rainer spent more than seven decades searching for new modes of expression, producing a body of abstract work that is most closely associated with the Art Informel movement. \n\n\tHe is best known for his Übermalungen (“overpaintings”), a technique he began in 1952 in which he layered dense strokes of pigment over existing images—at first his own images, and, from 1953 onward, those of other artists such as Italian painter Emilio Vedova. Rainer’s resulting works, seemingly at once destructive and devotional, turned painting into a site of erasure, accumulation, and spiritual immersion. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“The organic act of creating is perhaps more essential than the completed painting,” he once said, likening the process to a contemplative ritual.\n\n\tAcross the 1950s and ’60s, Rainer turned his painterly attention to the body and self. His “blind drawings,” as well as the “Face Farces” and “Body Poses” series featured overpainted photographic self-portraits whose gestural marks complicated the artist’s presentation of his own psyche. Though not a Viennese Actionist, he exerted a catalytic influence on the movement’s early years.\n\n\tRainer’s engagement with postwar trauma also shaped his work. His 1951 photographic portfolio “Perspectives of Destruction” listed the catastrophic losses of the recent past—Hiroshima, the Holocaust, war and wreckage—and his subsequent layers of black, matte, and glossy paint became what art historian Helmut Friedel described as a “painterly skin in which history is safely stored.” Rainer later adapted this approach to enlarged photo-booth self-portraits, attacking the surface with paint applied by hand, producing hybrid images that fused representation with abstraction.\n\n\tBy the late 1960s and ’70s, major institutions had begun to recognize his importance. He received an early survey in 1968 at the Museum des 20. Jahrhunderts (now called Mumok) in Austria; participated in the 1972, 1977, and 1982 editions of Documenta in Kassel, Germany; and gained international prominence after exhibitions at Kunsthalle Bern and the Lenbachhaus Munich in 1977. \n\t\n\n\tHe represented Austria at the 1978 Venice Biennale, the same year he received the Grand Austrian State Prize. In the 1980s, he continued to have major exhibitions at the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Centre Pompidou in Paris, Abbazia di San Gregorio in Venice, and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. He also taught at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna from 1981 to 1995.\n\n\tHis work is included in dozens of major museum collections in Germany, Austria, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US. In 2009, the Arnulf Rainer Museum opened in Baden, which celebrated his 95th birthday with a monographic exhibition in 2024.\n\n\t“An artist makes the past his own and adds something new,” art historian Rudi H. Fuchs once wrote of the artist whom he included in Documenta 7. Rainer’s dealer Thaddaeus Ropac, who worked with the artist for more than four decades, called him “a true innovator,” adding: “He never stopped pushing the boundaries of what art could be and how it could be created.”\n\n\tArt critic Donald Kuspit perhaps put it best: in Rainer’s hands, gesture regained not only its raw energy but its “significance as an indicator of inner mystery.”\n",

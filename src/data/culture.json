Gianfranco Rosi, 2025 (image courtesy Film at Lincoln Center)</span></figcaption>\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>There must be a certain level of anxiety that comes with living in Naples, in the shadow of Vesuvius. It’s not just that it’s an active volcano that can blow its top at any minute, but also that it’s done so time and again throughout history, and that the most famous eruption — the one that destroyed the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 CE and preserved them in ash — is now a world-famous tourist attraction. Visitors can flee from the homes and bodies of ancient ancestors who died in terror, suffocating on ash and toxic gases,  but it could happen to you and yours tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Filmmaker Gianfranco Rosi skillfully captures that unease in <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/below-the-clouds/\">Below The Clouds</a></em>, shooting in elegant black and white that gives the film a dreamlike quality (he even opens with an epigraph by surrealist Jean Cocteau). The director darts between various people and places in the Southern Italian metropolis, capturing a wide swathe of civic institutions and experiences.</p>\n<p>The city’s particularities surface in the process. The local <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28254297\"><em>carabinieri</em></a> investigate illegal tunnels used for breaking into ancient tombs. The fire department monitors seismic activity emanating from the volcano. An after-school language tutor instructs students in French by comparing it with the Neapolitan dialect. Painterly images are interspersed like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/enigmatic-pillow-shots-yasujiro-ozu\">pillow shots</a>: commuter trains rambling down their tracks, ocean waves contrasted with lava flows, Greco-Roman statues languishing at the bottom of the sea. </p>\n<figure><div><p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eF_RPx6CXFw/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube video\" /></p></div></figure>\n<p>Naples emerges as something of a microcosmic metaphor for cataclysm knocking on the door of the rest of the world. At no time is this more apparent (and sometimes comedic) than when locals call the fire department after an earthquake tremor — a sign that Vesuvius may erupt. The callers range from hysterical (“What death do they want us to die?” says one woman) to the amusingly miffed (an annoyed man complains, “I was cooking a nice <em>ragù</em>”). Rarely has Marx’s famous saying about history weighing “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm\">like a nightmare on the brains of the living</a>” felt so literal. </p>\n<p>At certain moments, the knocking becomes more urgent. The director nods to his recent films, <em>Fire at Sea</em> (2016) and <em>Notturno</em> (2020), addressing the European migrant crisis and conflict in the Middle East, respectively, in a scene involving a Syrian-staffed freighter transporting grain to and from Odessa in Ukraine, under bombardment from Russia. The crew watch news reports about other ships getting bombed, yet are unperturbed: “We Syrians are used to war and bombs.” </p>\n<p>History feels particularly heavy in scenes that takes us into the catacomb-like storage of one of the city’s museums. Audiences peer into rooms full of statues and ancient artifacts, some shelved and sorted, others thrown into a massive pile of stone heads and bodies from dozens of eras: Greek, Roman, Bourbon, modern. The unusual or particularly important ones get photographed, such as a statue of Lakshmi (“the Indian Venus,” a researcher remarks) found at Pompeii that proves an ancient link to Eastern cultures. </p>\n<p>These scenes, in which historical art merges with Rosi’s sublime visuals, serve as a sort of <em>memento mori</em> for all the civilizations and rulers left in the dust. They remind us that borders and nations are contemporary inventions: Naples, after all, is older than Italy, a nation state only formed in 1861. Pompeii is older than Naples. And Vesuvius, older than any country, will outlive us all. </p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2025/films/below-the-clouds/\">Below The Clouds</a> <em>screens at the New York Film Festival (144 West 65th Street, Lincoln Square, Manhattan) on October 5 and 6. </em></p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/douglas-markowitz/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Avatar photo\" src=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/doug-markowitz.jpg\" srcset=\"https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/doug-markowitz.jpg 2x\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></p><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDouglas Markowitz is a journalist and critic covering art, film, and music.

The presentation places Norman Rockwell’s powerful Civil Rights–era images in conversation with a sweeping historical survey featuring artists and illustrators such as Faith Ringgold, Emory Douglas, Howard Pyle, and Loveis Wise.</p>\n<p>Featuring over 200 works originally commissioned for newspapers, magazines, books, trade cards, posters, packaging, and advertising, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bit.ly/3VIBw0A\">Delaware Art Museum (DelArt)</a> exhibition traces the prevalence of harmful and prolific racial stereotypes that were historically sanctioned in popular print culture. At the same time, <em>Imprinted </em>celebrates the concerted efforts of 20th- and 21st-century artists, editors, and publishers who used illustration to challenge those narratives — publishing inclusive imagery that emphasizes agency and equity across print and digital platforms.</p>\n<p>The Norman Rockwell Museum convened a national advisory board of artists and scholars during the show’s development; DelArt’s Curator of American Art, Heather Campbell Coyle, served on that board and contributed to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bit.ly/4nyrGL7\">exhibition catalogue</a>. The presentation at DelArt is part of an institutional exchange: while <em>Imprinted</em> is on view here, the Norman Rockwell Museum will host DelArt’s <em>Jazz Age Illustration</em> from November 8, 2025, to April 6, 2026 — an exhibition swap that highlights DelArt’s commitment to creative collaborations and partnerships that enhance public engagement with art and community.</p>\n<p><em>Imprinted</em> opens at the Delaware Art Museum on October 18, 2025. The show invites visitors to confront complex histories, consider the lasting power of images, and join conversations about representation and publishing. Gallery interpretation, catalogue essays, and a public program series will provide context and opportunities for discussion. </p>\n<p><strong>For more information, visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bit.ly/3KM0zxk\">delart.org</a>.</strong></p>\n\t</div>\n</article>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</section>"

He described photo presses as a way to make photography more “democratic,” in contrast to gallery-priced works. Gowin’s press prints the work of Japanese-American photographer Osamu James Nakagawa, who sought in 2022 to photograph every Japanese incarceration camp established in 1942. This year, Gowin printed the photographer’s work in newspaper tabloid format, selling them for $20 each.</p>\n<p>“This project is about news and current events,” Gowin said. “When I saw on the news

    "body": "<div>\n<p>LOS ANGELES — The Hammer Museum’s biennial,<em> </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2025/made-la-2025\"><em>Made in LA</em></a>, provides a snapshot of the state of contemporary art throughout the greater region, attempting to give coherent form to its sprawling and heterogeneous artistic landscape. With this year’s edition, opening to the public October 5, curators Essence Harden and Paulina Pobocha embraced that messiness, noting that LA’s “dissonance is perhaps its most distinguishing feature.” </p>\n<p>Still, after dozens of studio visits, the pair were able to identify some through lines. “If there is any single thread in this show, it is historical,” Harden told <em>Hyperallergic</em>, countering the stereotype of LA as a place that <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/products/1584-the-history-of-forgetting?\" target=\"_blank\">forgets its past</a>. “It is about histories.”</p>\n<p>Those histories range from the autobiographical to the communal, hyper-local to international; palimpsests layered in concrete and asphalt or held tight as personal memories. In advance of the exhibition’s opening, <em>Hyperallergic</em> highlights the work of five of the 28 participating artists, whose practices engage with narrative and memory in various ways.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"h-freddy-villalobos-b-1989-los-angeles\">Freddy Villalobos (b. 1989, Los Angeles)</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=720%2C540&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=800%2C600&quality=90&ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=600%2C450&quality=90&ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=400%2C300&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=200%2C150&quality=90&ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1500&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=780%2C585&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873.jpeg?resize=706%2C530&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6873-1200x900.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Freddy Villalobos, “waiting for the stone to speak, for I know nothing of aventure” (2025)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Freddy Villalobos’s installation “waiting for the stone to speak, for I know nothing of aventure” (2025), references the death of famed soul singer Sam Cooke as a vehicle to explore historical cycles, as it collapses the past, present, and future of LA. The work is centered around a video documenting a nighttime drive up Figueroa Street, from the Hacienda Motel where Sam Cooke was shot and killed in 1964 to the county morgue. The meditative single-shot, lasting nearly two hours, traverses time and space, from the historically African-American neighborhood of South Central where Villalobos grew up, north to the area being transformed by the University of Southern California’s ongoing expansion, to the LA Live entertainment complex and the infamous <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/870121/artists-make-los-angeles-graffiti-history-by-painting-on-abandoned-high-rises/\">graffiti towers</a>, examples of a “failed future,” as Villalobos called them. </p>\n<p>The installation is accompanied by a bass-heavy soundtrack which emanates from pedestals adorned with shiny automotive paint and purple neon. They are topped by abstract limestone frescoes that will deteriorate over time as the sonic vibrations turn their delicate surfaces back into dust. By revisiting this specific event through contemporary eyes, Villalobos draws parallels between Cooke’s cultural and political moment and our own. </p>\n<p>“The change we’re hoping for feels within our reach,” Villalobos said, echoing Cooke’s 1964 civil rights anthem, “A Change Is Gonna Come.”</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"h-patrick-martinez-b-1980-pasadena\"><strong>Patrick Martinez (b. 1980, Pasadena)</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=720%2C540&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=800%2C600&quality=90&ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=600%2C450&quality=90&ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=400%2C300&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=200%2C150&quality=90&ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1500&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=780%2C585&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858.jpeg?resize=706%2C530&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6858-1200x900.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Patrick Martinez, “Battle of the City on Fire” (2025), stucco, cinder blocks, neon, acrylic paint, spray paint, and latex house paint on scorched panel </figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>The physical landscape of Los Angeles also provides inspiration for Patrick Martinez, whose large-scale sculptural painting “Battle of the City on Fire” (2025) pulls from the city’s vernacular architecture, signage, and murals. The 70-foot long construction resembles a crumbling cinder-block wall, onto which Martinez has painted layers of history. The main image references a battle mural at Cacaxtla, an archaeological site in Mexico, linking LA’s rich mural culture with murals created hundreds of years ago elsewhere in the Americas. He imagines the brown-skinned warriors as the ancestors of the city’s Mexican and Central American communities, and draws parallels to LA’s current brutal immigration raids. “While I was making this work, in the world right outside, people were being disappeared and kidnapped, families being erased,” he said. </p>\n<p>Martinez has partially obscured this battle scene, covering it with graffiti tags, painted stucco, and neon, mimicking the accretion seen on storefronts throughout the city. He adds realistic depictions of bougainvillea, a plant native to Mexico that is ubiquitous across LA. “It’s like a landscape at first, but then you see the figures,” he notes, “and you understand that they’re either becoming covered up or breaking out.”</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"h-widline-cadet-b-1992-petion-ville-haiti\">Widline Cadet (b. 1992, Pétion-Ville, Haiti)</h3>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896-1200x890.jpeg?resize=1200%2C890&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=1200%2C890&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=720%2C534&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=768%2C570&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1139&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1519&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=1024%2C759&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1483&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=780%2C579&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=400%2C297&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896.jpeg?resize=706%2C524&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6896-1200x890.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Widline Cadet, “Shifting Skies” (2025)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Widline Cadet juxtaposes carefully composed portraits with archival family snapshots, placing them in shaped frames as part of larger installations. Born in Haiti, Cadet moved to the US as a child, and her fractured visions reference a sense of diasporic connection, bits and pieces of memories given equal weight as professionally staged photos. “I’m thinking about all the ways you measure life,” she told <em>Hyperallergic</em>. “Shifting Skies” (2025) is composed of 12 images in half-circle shaped frames, arranged in a design that resembles a pinwheel, or the pattern of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://la.curbed.com/2019/8/23/20826908/breeze-blocks-wall-los-angeles\">breeze blocks</a>, the perforated building blocks common to both Southern California and Haiti. This physical link, along with the region’s flora and warm weather, provided a sense of familiarity when Cadet moved to LA from New York three years ago. “I’ve never lived in a place that’s reminded me of my home country as much,” she said.</p>\n<p>Her sentiment underscores the notion that LA’s identity is fluid and multifaceted, informed by a myriad of sources from around the world. “LA is an international city that has an international impact,” said Harden. “It’s not isolated.”</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"h-ali-eyal-b-1994-baghdad-iraq\">Ali<strong> </strong>Eyal (b. 1994, Baghdad, Iraq)</h3>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal-1200x874.jpg?resize=1200%2C874&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=1200%2C874&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=720%2C524&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=768%2C559&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=1536%2C1119&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=2048%2C1492&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=1024%2C746&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=2000%2C1457&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=780%2C568&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=400%2C291&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal.jpg?resize=706%2C514&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/eyal-1200x874.jpg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Ali Eyal, “and look where I went” (2025)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Ali Eyal grew up in Baghdad during the American occupation of Iraq, and his paintings reflect the loss he experienced and his attempts to reckon with the aftermath. His large-scale canvases are often based on his personal experiences, but rendered as dream-like visions through his fantastical, figurative style. “And Look Where I Went” (2025) is based on his visit to the 9/11 Memorial in downtown New York last year — a site he had tried to avoid because of the profound despair embedded there. Nearby, he had a conversation with an Egyptian hot dog vendor who had recently immigrated to the US. Gazing into the void of the waterfalls, Eyal “became like a kid again,” he recalled, reliving the violence of the war and sectarian conflicts that followed. “It’s still happening, it’s ongoing,” he said.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"h-amanda-ross-ho-b-1975-chicago\">Amanda Ross-Ho (b. 1975, Chicago)</h3>\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861-1200x794.jpeg?resize=1200%2C794&quality=90&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=1200%2C794&quality=90&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=720%2C476&quality=90&ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=768%2C508&quality=90&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1016&quality=90&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1354&quality=90&ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=1024%2C677&quality=90&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=2000%2C1323&quality=90&ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=780%2C516&quality=90&ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=400%2C265&quality=90&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861.jpeg?resize=706%2C467&quality=90&ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6861-1200x794.jpeg?w=370&quality=90&ssl=1 370w\" /><figcaption>Amanda Ross-Ho, “Untitled Thresholds (FOUR SEASONS)” (2025)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Amanda Ross-Ho’s “Untitled Thresholds (FOUR SEASONS)” (2025) also stems from personal narrative, but is made accessible through decontextualization.

    "body": "<div><p>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/sean-combs/\">Sean Combs</a>, a rapper and record executive who made headlines when he bought a $21.1 million <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/kerry-james-marshall/\">Kerry James Marshall</a> painting in 2018, was sentenced in federal court on Friday to 50 months, or 4 years and 2 months. He was also fined $500,000, the maximum amount allowable by law. </p>\n<p>\n\tThe rapper, who also went by the name Diddy, was accused of racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution. He was acquitted of the racketeering and sex trafficking charges, but he was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution, both of which carried maximum sentences of up to 10 years each.\n\t</p>\n<section>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t</h2>\n</section>\n<p>\n\tThroughout the trial, which began in May, Combs maintained his innocence amid testimony from his ex-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, who alleged years of physical and sexual abuse. Combs was also accused of abuse and sexual assault by an anonymous former employee.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe sentencing hearing lasted all day Friday, with prosecutors, Combs’s defense team, his six adult children, and Combs all testifying. Prosecutor Christy Slavik said Combs is a “master puppeteer of his own image” and asked the judge not believe that Combs is a changed man, while Marc Agnifilo, who led Combs’s defense team, said “this has just been a devastating, destructive case for this man on the largest of stages,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/03/arts/sean-combs-diddy-sentencing\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> by the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his 12-minute statement, Combs called his behavior “disgusting, shameful and sick”; said he had “nobody to blame but myself”; and begged the judge for “mercy,” according to the <em>Times</em>. He apologized to Ventura before concluding his statement by saying, “No matter what anybody says, I know that I’m truly sorry for it all.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of issuing the sentence, Judge Arun Subramanian, of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, said that “a history of good works can’t wash away the record in this case, which shows that you abused the power and control over the lives of women who you professed to love,” according to the <em>Times</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tSubramanian called the prosecution’s request for more than 11 years “not reasonable” but said the defense’s request for 14 months not enough to convey the seriousness of the offense, adding that the fine was imposed because of Combs’s “immense financial resources,” which the judge said, “enabled his crimes,” per the <em>Times</em>. He ended his ruling by saying, “To Ms. Ventura and the other brave survivors that came forward, I want to say first: We heard you.”\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs has widely been reported to be an art collector, though it’s not entirely clear what works beyond the Marshall are in his holdings. That collection may not be his for much longer, however. Reports from earlier this year mentioned that the Department of Justice intended to seize his assets if he were to be found guilty of sex trafficking.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/arts/sean-combs-kerry-james-marshall.html\" target=\"_blank\">purchase</a> of the Marshall painting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/kerry-james-marshall-painting-sells-record-smashing-21-1-m-sothebys-high-flying-contemporary-art-evening-sale-10339/\">Sotheby’s in 2018</a> was perceived as a major purchase. Swizz Beatz, a record producer and art collector, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/swizz-beatz-alicia-keys-art-collection-13359/\">told <em>ARTnews</em></a> that Combs had made the acquisition at his behest.</p>\n<p>\n\tCombs’s purchase of the painting, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/sean-combs-diddy-may-lose-kerry-james-marshall-painting-1234743296/\">titled <em>Past Times</em> (1997)</a>, set Marshall’s auction record at the time and made him the most expensive living African American artist. The work is now included in Marshall’s Royal Academy of Arts retrospective in London, where wall text notes that the painting is held in a private collection, without specifying its owner.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe few remaining hints at the contents of Combs’s collections come via <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/will-scandal-plagued-diddy-offload-his-marquee-art-holdings-and-more-juicy-art-world-gossip-2463387\" target=\"_blank\">an <em>Artnet News</em> report</a> from 2024 that stated that he owns a neon sculpture by Tracey Emin, as well as works by the sculptor Brett Murray and the creative studio Random International, which is best known for its installation <em>Rain Room</em>.</p>\n</div>"

But among America’s art cities, Chicago might be the one best positioned to get through it, in part because it continues to draw and inspire people like Agada. </p>\n<p>\n\tChicago has art schools, art museums, and the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/27/travel/travel-news-best-connected-airports-2025\" target=\"_blank\">7th most-connected international airport</a> in the world. Art professionals, artists and gallerists told <em>ARTnews</em> that the city’s collaborative approach, affordable residential and commercial real estate, better work-life balance, and long history of fostering talent continue to be strengths even during this period of greater economic and political turmoil.</p>\n<p>\n\t“In the past 10 years, I’ve seen a lot more artists moving to Chicago,” said Monique Meloche, whose namesake gallery recently celebrated its 25th anniversary<em>.</em> “There’s always good artists here anyway, but there has been this palpable influx of outsiders who are realizing how great the city is, minus those first couple weeks in January.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Chicago is part of the strength of doing what it is, we do.” Emanuel Aguilar, co-founder of PATRON, told <em>ARTnews</em>, noting how often he can give tours of exhibitions to visitors. “And then, because of that, we can do things that others can’t. Like share the work with the community, with anyone that walked through that door.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BC397_In-petals-sweet-we-venture-forth_2025_300.jpg 8582w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BC397_In-petals-sweet-we-venture-forth_2025_300.jpg?resize=400,283 400w\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BC397_In-petals-sweet-we-venture-forth_2025_300.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Bethany Collins, <em>In petals sweet we venture forth</em>, (2024-2025).

Pritzker). Pucker started the event in 2023 in part to remedy a gap in Chicago’s art scene: the city already has a fair—<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/expo-chicago/\">Expo Chicago</a>, which co-organized CXW this time—but the last edition of Gallery Weekend Chicago, modeled after Gallery Weekend Berlin, took place in 2019.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFA_51390_7408224.jpg 3600w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFA_51390_7408224.jpg?resize=400,267 400w\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFA_51390_7408224.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"Gigi Pritzker Pucker, Abby Pucker\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Gigi Pritzker Pucker (L), Abby Pucker, and Michael Pucker at the Chicago Exhibition Weekend (CXW) Kickoff Dinner, hosted by Gertie.

And I’m just like, You know what? So many of our clients are going to be there. Let’s just have it the night before.”</p>\n<p>\n\tMeloche’s spirit of collaboration extends to the operations of Mariam Ibrahim Gallery, next door. “We’ll bring clients over to her,” Meloche said. “She’ll bring clients over to us. We’ve collaborated on dinners before. It’s like somebody buying something from next door is not going to stop them [from buying from us], or it might that year or that week or that month or whatever, but in the end, it’s like in everybody’s best interest.

Photography by Robert Heishman</span>\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tCompared to New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, Chicago has cheaper commercial and residential real estate. This means galleries like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/corbett-vs-dempsey/\">Corbett vs. Dempsey</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/mariane-ibrahim-gallery/\">Mariane Ibrahim Gallery</a> can afford larger spaces, including on-site or nearby storage. Artists, meanwhile, can obtain apartments and art studios for less money, thrifty curators can launch apartment-galleries, and collectors can buy bigger homes and spend more on art decorating them. </p>\n<p>\n\t“You can get 2.5 times more real estate for half the price of New York,” Michael Poulos, an art collector and distributor for Molteni stoves, told <em>ARTnews</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There are one bedrooms here for, like, $1,500,” said Old Friends Gallery cofounder Delia Pelli-Walbert, who relocated to Chicago from LA. “For the first two months, I felt <em>rich</em>.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“I bought my 2,000-square-foot house for $250,000,” a University of Chicago professor told <em>ARTnews. </em>“And I fill it with art.” </p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFA_51390_7408120.jpg 3600w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFA_51390_7408120.jpg?resize=400,286 400w\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFA_51390_7408120.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"Jenna Washington, Scott Campbell\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Jenna Washington and Independent Curators International Midwest programs manager Scott Campbell at the Chicago Exhibition Weekend (CXW) Kickoff Dinner, hosted by Gertie.

He arrived earlier this week.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Sometimes I feel a little selfish because I don’t want people to come because it’s like, so great that I kind of want to protect it,” Howard said. “But at the same time, if that means that there could be more opportunities that come into the city that can create and sustain financial growth, I’m all for it.”</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><img srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Offering_68x54_acrylic_on_canvas-.jpg 1440w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Offering_68x54_acrylic_on_canvas-.jpg?resize=400,313 400w\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Offering_68x54_acrylic_on_canvas-.jpg?w=400\" alt=\"\" />\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Armani Howard, <em>Offering</em> <em>(To the Sea)</em>, 2024.

(An opening date has not yet been set.)\n\t</p>\n<section>\n\t<h2 id=\"section-heading\">\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t</h2>\n</section>\n<p>\n\tPer a press release, SFMOMA is billing the exhibition as “a rare chance to see modern Korean artworks in conversation with contemporary artworks from around the world,” noting that a number of works from RM’s holdings have not been previously exhibited.</p>\n<p>\n\t“We live in an age defined by boundaries,” RM said in a statement. “This exhibition at SFMOMA reflects those boundaries: between East and West, Korea and America, the modern and the contemporary, the personal and the universal. I don’t want to prescribe how these works should be seen; whether out of curiosity or study, all perspectives are welcome. My only hope is that this exhibition can be a small but sturdy bridge for many.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Korean artists who will be featured in the exhibition worked in a range of styles. Among them are historical artists Yun Hyong-keun, an abstractionist associated with Dansaekhwa movement; Park Rehyun, who worked in both figurative and abstract modes; Chang Ucchin, known of his unique strain of modernism that focused on scenes of everyday life; and Kwon Okyon, an underknown artist internationally who died in 2011. Contemporary artists like realist painter To Sangbong and sculptor Kim Yun Shin, who showed in the 2024 Venice Biennale, will also be featured.</p>\n<p>\n\tTheir work will be paired with Western artists from SFMOMA’s collection like Mark Rothko, Agnes Martin, Henri Matisse, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Paul Klee. The exhibition will also include <em><a href=\"https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/79.127/\" target=\"_blank\">26-I-70 </a></em><a href=\"https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/79.127/\" target=\"_blank\">(1979)</a>, the sole work by<strong> </strong>Kim Whanki, an abstractionist whose spare paintings preceded the Dansaekhwa movement; this work is owned by SFMOMA.   </p>\n<p>\n\tFor the past few years, RM has used his fame to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/list/art-news/news/btss-rm-has-sent-k-pop-fans-flooding-to-art-museums-thanks-to-his-instagram-1234632793/\">steer his fans into art museums</a>. A road trip across this US in 2021 saw him visit institutions like the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Menil Collection and the Rothko Chapel in Houston, and the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas. His Instagram posts documenting his visits led to increase followers and interactions for the museums, as well as a bump in attendance figures.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis loan of a work Kwon Jin Kyu to the Seoul Museum of Art in 2022 led that exhibition to become one of the museum’s most attended presentations that year. “As one of many art enthusiasts, I just want to visit great exhibitions when I get a chance and share with people so they can enjoy them as well,” RM <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/btss-rm-interview-kpop-fine-art-1234635267/\">told <em>ARTnews</em></a> in 2022.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis past June, RM completed his compulsory military service and has since reemerged on the contemporary art scene. He became a global ambassador for Samsung Art TV, which saw him <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/rm-of-bts-debuts-as-samsung-electronics-art-tv-global-ambassador-at-art-basel-in-basel-2025\" target=\"_blank\">participate in a panel</a> at Art Basel in Switzerland in June.   </p>\n<p>\n\tIn a statement, SFMOMA chief curator Janet Bishop said, “Visitors will have an unprecedented opportunity to explore RM’s beautiful and contemplative collection of paintings and sculpture in dialogue with works from SFMOMA’s holdings, inviting us to make new discoveries and reflect on our own relationships with art.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Correction, October 3, 2025:</strong> <em>An earlier version of this article misreported the opening date of “RM x SFMOMA” as October 2025, instead of October 2026. </em></p>\n</div>"

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nCer­tain cult his­tor­i­cal fig­ures have served as pre­scient avatars for the tech­no-vision­ar­ies of the dig­i­tal age. Where the altru­is­tic utopi­an designs of Buck­min­ster Fuller pro­vid­ed an ide­al for the first wave of Sil­i­con Val­ley pio­neers (a group includ­ing com­put­er sci­en­tist and philoso­pher Jaron Lanier and Wired edi­tor Kevin Kel­ly), lat­er entre­pre­neurs have hewn clos­er to the prin­ci­ples of bril­liant sci­en­tist and inven­tor Niko­la Tes­la, who believed, as he told Lib­er­ty mag­a­zine in 1935, that “we suf­fer the derange­ment of our civ­i­liza­tion because we have not yet com­plete­ly adjust­ed our­selves to the machine age.”\nSuch an adjust­ment would come, Tes­la believed, only in “mas­ter­ing the machine”—and he seemed to have supreme con­fi­dence in human mastery—over food pro­duc­tion, cli­mate, and genet­ics. We would be freed from oner­ous labor by automa­tion and the cre­ation of “a think­ing machine,” he said, over a decade before the inven­tion of the com­put­er. Tes­la did not antic­i­pate the ways such machines would come to mas­ter us, even though he can­ni­ly fore­saw the future of wire­less tech­nol­o­gy, com­put­ing, and tele­pho­ny, tech­nolo­gies that would rad­i­cal­ly reshape every aspect of human life.\nIn an ear­li­er, 1926, inter­view in Col­lier’s mag­a­zine, Tes­la pre­dict­ed, as the edi­tors wrote, com­mu­ni­cat­ing “instant­ly by sim­ple vest-pock­et equip­ment.” His actu­al words con­veyed a much grander, and more accu­rate, pic­ture of the future.\nWhen wire­less is per­fect­ly applied the whole earth will be con­vert­ed into a huge brain, which in fact it is…. We shall be able to com­mu­ni­cate with one anoth­er instant­ly, irre­spec­tive of dis­tance. Not only this, but through tele­vi­sion and tele­pho­ny we shall see and hear one anoth­er as per­fect­ly as though we were face to face, despite inter­ven­ing dis­tances of thou­sands of miles; and the instru­ments through which we shall be able to do this will be amaz­ing­ly sim­ple com­pared with our present tele­phone. A man will be able to car­ry one in his vest pock­et. \nThe com­plex­i­ty of smart­phones far out­strips that of the tele­phone, but in every oth­er respect, Tesla’s pic­ture maps onto the real­i­ty of almost 100 years lat­er. Oth­er aspects of Tesla’s future sce­nario for wire­less also seem to antic­i­pate cur­rent tech­nolo­gies, like 3D print­ing, though the kind he describes still remains in the realm of sci­ence fic­tion: “Wire­less will achieve the clos­er con­tact through trans­mis­sion of intel­li­gence, trans­port of our bod­ies and mate­ri­als and con­veyance of ener­gy.”\nBut Tesla’s vision had its lim­i­ta­tions, and they lay pre­cise­ly in his tech­no-opti­mism. He nev­er met a prob­lem that wouldn’t even­tu­al­ly have a tech­no­log­i­cal solu­tion (and like many oth­er tech­no-vision­ar­ies of the time, he hearti­ly endorsed state-spon­sored eugen­ics). “The major­i­ty of the ills from which human­i­ty suf­fers,” he said, “are due to the immense extent of the ter­res­tri­al globe and the inabil­i­ty of indi­vid­u­als and nations to come into close con­tact.”\nWire­less tech­nol­o­gy, thought Tes­la, would help erad­i­cate war, pover­ty, dis­ease, pol­lu­tion, and gen­er­al dis­con­tent, when we are “able to wit­ness and hear events—the inau­gu­ra­tion of a Pres­i­dent, the play­ing of a world series game, the hav­oc of an earth­quake or the ter­ror of a battle—just as though we were present.” When inter­na­tion­al bound­aries are “large­ly oblit­er­at­ed” by instant com­mu­ni­ca­tion, he believed, “a great step will be made toward the uni­fi­ca­tion and har­mo­nious exis­tence of the var­i­ous races inhab­it­ing the globe.”\nTes­la did not, and per­haps could not, fore­see the ways in which tech­nolo­gies that bring us clos­er togeth­er than ever also, and at the same time, pull us ever fur­ther apart. Read Tes­la’s full inter­view here, in which he also pre­dicts that women will become the “supe­ri­or sex,” not by virtue of “the shal­low phys­i­cal imi­ta­tion of men” but through “the awak­en­ing of the intel­lect.”\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nSci-Fi Author J.G.

    "body": "\n\tin Comedy, History, Television |   \tNovember 3rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn 1957, the BBC pro­gram Panora­ma aired one of the first tele­vised April Fools’ Day hoax­es. Above, you can watch a faux news report from Switzer­land nar­rat­ed by respect­ed BBC jour­nal­ist Richard Dim­ble­by. Here’s the basic premise: After a mild win­ter and the “vir­tu­al dis­ap­pear­ance of the spaghet­ti wee­vil,” the res­i­dents of Ticoni (a Swiss can­ton on the Ital­ian bor­der) reap a record-break­ing spaghet­ti har­vest. Swiss farm­ers pluck strands of spaghet­ti from trees and lay them out to dry in the sun. Then we cut to Swiss res­i­dents enjoy­ing a fresh pas­ta meal for dinner—going from farm to table, as it were.\nThe spoof doc­u­men­tary orig­i­nat­ed with the BBC cam­era­man Charles de Jaeger. He remem­bered one of his child­hood school­teach­ers in Aus­tria jok­ing, “Boys, you are so stu­pid, you’d believe me if I told you that spaghet­ti grew on trees.” Appar­ent­ly he was right. Years lat­er, David Wheel­er, the pro­duc­er of the BBC seg­ment, recalled: “The fol­low­ing day [the broad­cast] there was quite a to-do because there were lots of peo­ple who went to work and said to their col­leagues ‘did you see that extra­or­di­nary thing on Panora­ma? I nev­er knew that about spaghet­ti.’ ” An esti­mat­ed eight mil­lion peo­ple watched the orig­i­nal pro­gram, and, decades lat­er, CNN called the broad­cast “the biggest hoax that any rep­utable news estab­lish­ment ever pulled.”\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFlowers, stars, leaves, eyes, and countless patterns transform into billowing garments in Irene Saputra’s vibrant embroideries. The South Jakarta-based artist, who also goes by Nengiren, repeats the playful motif of nona kecil, which means “little woman” in Indonesian. \nSaputra’s fashion-forward character might be described as a clotheshorse who dons numerous bold outfits, some of which seem to have personalities of their own. Saputra has often referred to these styles as OOTD’s, or outfits of the day, borrowing from a hashtag historically used by fashion influencers on social media.\n“Arak Arakan Sepi 2”\nThe faceless figure’s cropped bob and black boots are the only commonality, as always-symmetrical wide-leg trousers or dresses vary widely. Through color, scale, and repetition, Saputra’s hand-stitched characters also coordinate and complement one another. Some, like the Arak Arakan Sepi series—meaning “quiet procession” in Indonesian—are more abstract and bulbous, while others, like “ARTSUBS,” depict more realistic outfits.\nSaputra draws on a background in graphic design and illustration, which she applies to her fiber compositions. Through the lens of women’s fashion and personal expression, she channels optimism and her own journey of motherhood.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaurizio Cattelan, “America” (2016) (image courtesy Sotheby's)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nExactly one year after “Comedian” (2019), the cursed banana duct-taped to the wall, went under the hammer at Sotheby’s and down Chinese crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s gullet for a whopping $6.2 million, Maurizio Cattelan returns like clockwork to play in our faces once again. \nCattelan’s functional, 18-karat gold toilet “America” (2016) will lead Sotheby’s “The Now and Contemporary” evening sale on November 18, with starting bids expected at around $10.2 million on account of the toilet weighing in at just over 223lbs (101.2kg).\nSotheby’s is set to ring in its debut in its new headquarters at Manhattan’s Breuer Building on November 8 with the pre-auction display of “America” in one of its restrooms. While designed to be fully operational, the toilet is only available in one-to-one viewing sessions with visitors through the 17th, and nobody is permitted to use it for its intended purpose this time around.\nThe initial iteration of the work had been installed in the restroom of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, allowing museum visitors to wait up to several hours to relieve themselves in it like they would with any other commode (save for some security and maintenance restrictions). During the onset of Donald Trump’s inauguration and first presidency, Cattelan’s topical multi-million dollar sculpture drew criticism and trolling from every corner — from yarn-bombing the work onsite at the Guggenheim to the museum’s then-Chief Curator Nancy Spector offering to loan the work to the Trumps for its display in the White House in lieu of their initial request to borrow a Vincent van Gogh painting. \nIn 2019, “America” made headlines yet again after it was stolen from the Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England, while on loan to the mansion and birthplace of Winston Churchill for a solo exhibition of Cattelan’s works. The original toilet was never recovered, though two men were sentenced this year for their involvement with the heist. \nNow, the second edition of “America,” timed with Trump’s second term, returns to ruffle feathers in Cattelan’s continued mission to abuse the public while he questions how people ascribe value to objects and ideas and critiques the broader art market’s priorities — especially now that some 40 million vulnerable Americans are threatened with profound food insecurity amid the ongoing government shutdown. \nSpector was right to offer the toilet up to Donald and Melania instead of a van Gogh painting, because there couldn’t possibly be a better home for it than the forthcoming ballroom that gobbled up the White House’s East Wing. \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProtesters sprayed the phrase \"LAND BACK\" on riot shields held by police sent to the action at Mount Rushmore on July 2, 2020. (photo Candi Brings Plenty)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nI sit in front of my laptop on July 3, 2020, Facebook Live in full swing. I watch as cars zoom past the camera. Some drivers honk. Others hurl insults and rude gestures. My emotions are high despite watching from the safety of my home in Rapid City, South Dakota. I worry about my relatives, but I feel a deep sense of justice. I see the words “LAND BACK” splashed across banners, shawls, and paramilitary gear. I wait with anxious excitement and pride to see what the group of relatives does next; they illustrate our connection to this place through their activation.\nThe protest was a collective action led by Očéti Šakówiŋ activists to disrupt Donald Trump’s presidential rally at Mount Rushmore, held the day before the Fourth of July. The rally and highway blockage, of course, were escalated by aggressive police presence and eventually end in multiple arrests. By the end of it, the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office will have arrested 20 adults and one minor, mostly tribal citizens, including Ogala Lakota organizer Nick Tilsen. This is the energy I like to see: ongoing disruption of settler-colonial institutions and criticism directed at the monument.\nThe rally echoed similar demonstrations that occurred in the early 1970s, when relatives camped at the base of the monument, poured paint on the faces, and demanded the return of stewardship of the Black Hills to the Očéti Šakówiŋ (Lakota-, Dakota-, Nakota-speaking tribal communities). The call for land back has been consistent since the monument was authorized for construction on the face of Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe, or Six Grandfathers, in March 1925, one year after the federal government forced American citizenship on tribal nations through the Citizenship Act of 1924 and around 50 years after the land was stolen from several nations grouped under the umbrella term of “the Sioux” in the treaty. Completed over 14 years, the monument was designed by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and named for the New York attorney who secured the land for the Harney Peak Tin Company. For a century, our deep-rooted connection to the Black Hills has been disrupted by this eyesore and those who flock ignorantly and actively to a place that we see as our relative, our grandfather and grandmother.\nCharles D’Emery’s photo of Six Grandfathers in 1927, before the construction began on the carvings for Mount Rushmore. (image public domain via the Mount Rushmore National Historic Site – National Park Service, Dickinson State University, and Theodore Roosevelt Digital Library)\nAny memorialization of the United States government on our land is a blight. We have been facing assimilation tactics for much longer, but this hundred-year period has seen the waxing and waning of resistance, paradigm-shifting rhetoric, and defiant direct action that evokes a sense of continuity and relentlessness.\nWhen family or friends come to visit and ask to see Mount Rushmore, I begrudgingly tell them I will drive them by the entrance. A visit to the park almost feels like a rite of passage; here are four faces that represent oppression, violence, and the agility of tribal perseverance. If you have never been to the monument, visitors might fill your ear with fun facts — Thomas Jefferson’s vanilla ice cream recipe or the lighting system that illuminates the faces at night.\nBut on my most recent visit in 2022, I felt as though I were on the set of a horror movie, with patriotic zombies shuffling out of the pine trees. I always encourage my passengers to flip an obligatory bird toward the monument. I remind people that this is what we have survived: town-destroyer George Washington, enslaver Thomas Jefferson, racist Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, who ordered the hanging of the Dakota 38 + 2. As much as this ode to the institutions of settler colonial violence is designed to inflict terror upon me, it also fails — my rootedness in the Black Hills will always be a comfort that persists beyond erasure. \nThe author at Mount Rushmore in September 2020 (photo Clementine Bordeaux/Hyperallergic)\nThe monument is not without nuance and complexity. There are currently Očéti Šakówiŋ relatives who regularly perform at the site, hoop dancing and singing, during the peak of South Dakota tourism. Other relatives work for regional National Park Service sites and maintain relationships with Mount Rushmore to ensure that Indigenous narratives are included, even if only marginally. At the same time, the monument is haunted by politicians like the former South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, who currently holds a position of power — secretary of Homeland Security — that terrorizes our Black and Brown relatives across the nation while ridiculously hosting naturalization celebrations at the site. \nIf Mount Rushmore were destroyed and lost to memory, tribal people would continue unbothered by this blip in history. The Black Hills is our wizípaŋ, a vital repository that holds sites of relational significance. We pray here, we share stories, we build memories on the land. When passing Mount Rushmore, our eyes are trained to see the four awful faces of settler violence. But I still see the Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe and all the non-human relatives that will continue to exist in the region beyond white supremacy. Očéti Šakówiŋ people will continue to pass by the monument without or without celebration, and I imagine in another 100 years we’ll be asking, “Rushmore, who?”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClementine Bordeaux is an enrolled member of the Sicangu Oyate (Rosebud Sioux Tribe) and grew up on the Pine Ridge Reservation (South Dakota).

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nNayland Blake at work (all images courtesy the artist)\nEditor’s Note: The following text has been excerpted with permission and adapted from My Studio Is a Dungeon Is the Studio: Writings and Interviews, 1983–2024 by Nayland Blake, edited by Jarrett Earnest, published by Duke University Press on November 4, and available online and in bookstores (Copyright Duke University Press, 2025).\n\nI’ve taught for 30 years in colleges, residencies, and sex parties. I’ve come to view teaching as a necessity, a way of putting back into the world the culture and ideas the world has poured into me. The bedrock of teaching art is the assignment. And the basis for my own work as an artist is being able to give myself assignments. The right assignment at the right time can answer a need we ­haven’t been able to articulate to ourselves. The assignments we need tell the story of how we view the work and the world, even if they tell it slant. I give my students assignments that ­were given to me directly in school as well as others that I’ve gleaned from the writings of artists and thinkers in vari­ous fields. Finding a good assignment provides a thrill. I give them to ­people for vari­ous reasons — to build a par­tic­u­lar skill or to perhaps lead someone to a dif­fer­ent sense of how they could look at what they do. Some of ­these I’ve honed over years of classes in vari­ous disciplines; some are for no one but myself. When I doubt what I do or am unable to get myself to work, the only ­thing that has got me out is a self-­administered assignment. They have been my technique for creating myself. Good assignments are not easy to come up with, but one princi­ple that has helped me comes out of recovery: Take the action, and let go of the result. Many times people attempt to use assignments to force ­people to come to a conclusion, to predetermine the outcome. Good assignments awaken us to the breadth of possibilities available to us rather than narrow ­things down to one possibility. They are the scaffolding we build to touch the unexpected and wild within ourselves. They are how we stretch. ­There is no right or wrong answer. ­There is only the next ­thing to do.\nWhile ­these assignments ­will not turn someone ­else into me, they ­will provide the practitioner with a path to the deviations within themselves.\nThe right assignment at the right time can answer a need we ­haven’t been able to articulate to ourselves.\n\nReconstruct, without photo­graphs, a childhood toy, including what it felt, smelled, and tasted like.\nDesign a sculpture to be taken internally.\nMake a crown.

To reach the National Sexual Assault Hotline, call 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or visit online.rainn.org.\nPARIS — The Grand Palais in Paris is currently bedecked with awnings advertising the forthcoming Art Basel, a bastion of contemporary art. The Petit Palais, its mini version across the street, feels like the exact opposite, with its holdings of 19th-century art. On the 300th anniversary of the birth of Jean-Baptiste Greuze, it has chosen to mount a survey of his depictions of 18th-century French life through the prism of childhood. It claims that though Greuze is little celebrated today, he was incredibly popular in his own time, enjoying consistent success at the Salon and regularly collected by a wealth of patrons, and argues that he was “one of the most daring figures of the 18th century.” \nThose crossing the road from a display of what is popular today to one of what was in vogue then will learn that in the 1700s, populism meant technically proficient but excessively mawkish and moralizing renditions of women and children with eyes rolling a-heavenward. Curators Annick Lemoine, Yuriko Jackall, and Mickaël Szanto argue that Greuze’s renditions of families experiencing the societal rites of the time — bible-reading, school lessons, bearing witness to death — are critical and sharp renderings of psychological experience. The key issue here is the word “critical.” These works call to mind similar domestic scenes painted by William Hogarth in England a few decades earlier, which tackled the same scenes with no degree of sentimentality, employing biting satire to ridicule societal norms. But there is no abject criticism here — just a sympathetic, appealing softness both in painterly treatment and subject matter, which is mostly wide-eyed figures doing wholesome family stuff.\nJean-Baptiste Greuze, “Portrait of Anne-Geneviève (known as Caroline) Greuze” (1766), oil on canvas\nThe first impression of the exhibition is of a flurry of portraits of children clutching dogs, reading forlornly, or glancing adorably over their shoulders, insipid eyes gazing wetly at us. The real moralizing comes with the domestic scenes — in fact, it quickly becomes clear that that really should have been the focus, rather than childhood. Works in this category include genre scenes like “Silence!” (1759), in which a woman cares for her three children, and “Bible Reading”(1755), which includes a peasant family complete with inattentive children, eventually expanding into sections dedicated to themes such as father-son relations. Here we find depictions of an obscure Roman history story of “Septus Severus Reproaching his Son Caracalla” (1767–69), accompanied by a study for “Caracalla” (1767). It smells of insufficient direct childhood material to work with, which would have been fine (please, no more doe-eyed sprogs) if the show had centered the wider topic of domesticity.\nWhere the choice to focus on childhood becomes outright problematic is the show’s bizarre conclusion, which consists of several examples from a series on spoiled innocence, as well as, more explicitly, lost virginity. Here are innumerable worryingly adorable pre-pubescent girls sighing over a dead bird (“The Dead Bird,” 1800) or crying over a dead bird (“Young Girl with a Dead Bird,” 1763) in an allegory of lost innocence. “The Broken Vessel” (1771–72), in which an exposed girl with crumpled clothes gazes vacantly past the viewer following a recent unsavory experience, takes on the theme more explicitly. The curators write that “Greuze was the first painter to associate the loss of virginity with the notion of trauma.” Maybe so, but glance at its grand oval frame, and the subject’s deliberate attractiveness in dishevelment — we can’t have the girl looking actually upset, it seems to suggest, romanticizing this cruelest of experiences. Then think of his contemporaneous popularity, which this exhibition took such pains to emphasize. Such portrayals are perhaps the most revealing element about childhood in the whole show, and what they suggest has less to do with Greuze’s work in particular and more about the social views of his time.\nJean-Baptiste Greuze, “The Broken Vessel” (1771–72), oil on canvas\nJean-Baptiste Greuze, “The Father’s Curse.

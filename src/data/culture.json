    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tOctober 29th, 2025  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAmer­i­can is a tricky word. It can refer to every­one and every­thing of or per­tain­ing to all the coun­tries of North Amer­i­ca — and poten­tial­ly South Amer­i­ca as well — but it’s com­mon­ly used with spe­cif­ic regard to the Unit­ed States. For Frank Lloyd Wright, lin­guis­tic as well as archi­tec­tur­al per­fec­tion­ist, this was an unten­able state of affairs. To his mind, the newest civ­i­liza­tion of the New World, a vast land that offered man the rare chance to remake him­self, need­ed an adjec­tive all its own. And so, repur­pos­ing a demonym pro­posed by geo­g­ra­ph­er James Duff Law in the nine­teen-hun­dreds, Wright began to refer to his not just archi­tec­tur­al but also broad­ly cul­tur­al project as Uson­ian.\nWright com­plet­ed the first of his so-called “Uson­ian hous­es,” the Her­bert and Kather­ine Jacobs House in Madi­son, Wis­con­sin, in the mid­dle of the Great Depres­sion. Chal­lenged to “cre­ate a decent home for $5,000,” says the Frank Lloyd Wright Foun­da­tion’s web site, the archi­tect seized the chance to real­ize “a new afford­able archi­tec­ture that freed itself from Euro­pean con­ven­tions and respond­ed to the Amer­i­can land­scape.”\nThis first Uson­ian house and its 60 or so suc­ces­sors “relat­ed direct­ly to the earth, unim­ped­ed by a foun­da­tion, front porch, pro­trud­ing chim­ney, or dis­tract­ing shrub­bery. Glass cur­tain walls and nat­ur­al mate­ri­als like wood, stone and brick fur­ther tied the house to its envi­ron­ment.” In Pleas­antville, New York, there even exists a Uso­nia His­toric Dis­trict, three of whose 47 homes were designed by Wright him­self.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe BBC Glob­al video at the top of the post offers a tour of one of the Uso­nia His­toric Dis­tric­t’s hous­es led by the sole sur­viv­ing orig­i­nal own­er, the 100-year-old Roland Reis­ley. The Archi­tec­tur­al Digest video above fea­tures Reis­ley’s home as well as the Bertha and Sol Fried­man House, which Wright dubbed Toy­hill. Both have been kept as adher­ent as pos­si­ble to the vision that inspired them, and that was meant to inspire a renais­sance in Amer­i­can civ­i­liza­tion. The Uson­ian homes may have fall­en short of Wright’s Utopi­an hopes, but they did have a cer­tain influ­ence on post­war sub­urb-builders, and have much enriched the lives of their more appre­cia­tive inhab­i­tants. The cen­te­nar­i­an Reis­ley cred­its his star­tling youth­ful­ness to the man-made and nat­ur­al beau­ty of his domes­tic sur­round­ings — but then, this last of the Uso­ni­ans also hap­pens to be one of the rare clients who could get along with Frank Lloyd Wright.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhat Frank Lloyd Wright’s Unusu­al Win­dows Tell Us About His Archi­tec­tur­al Genius\n12 Famous Frank Lloyd Wright Hous­es Offer Vir­tu­al Tours: Hol­ly­hock House, Tal­iesin West, Falling­wa­ter & More\nHow Frank Lloyd Wright’s Archi­tec­ture Evolved Over 70 Years and Changed Amer­i­ca\nFrank Lloyd Wright Designs an Urban Utopia: See His Hand-Drawn Sketch­es of Broad­acre City (1932)\nHow Frank Lloyd Wright Became Frank Lloyd Wright: A Video Intro­duc­tion\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tOctober 30th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nApart from cer­tain stretch­es of absence, Leonar­do’s Mona Lisa has been on dis­play at the Lou­vre for 228 years and count­ing. Though cre­at­ed by an Ital­ian in Italy, the paint­ing has long since been a part of French cul­ture. At some point, the rev­er­ence for La Joconde, as the Mona Lisa is local­ly known, reached such an inten­si­ty as to inspire the label Jocondisme. For Mar­cel Duchamp, it all seems to have been a bit much. In 1919, he bought a post­card bear­ing the image of that most famous of all paint­ings, drew a mus­tache and goa­tee on it, and dubbed the result­ing “art­work” L.H.O.O.Q., whose French pro­nun­ci­a­tion “Elle a chaud au cul” trans­lates to — as Duchamp mod­est­ly put it — “There is fire down below.”\n\n\n\t\n\nA cen­tu­ry ago, this was a high­ly irrev­er­ent, even blas­phe­mous act, but also just what one might expect from the man who, a cou­ple years ear­li­er, signed a uri­nal and put it on dis­play in a gallery. Like the much-scru­ti­nized Foun­tain, L.H.O.O.Q. was one of Ducham­p’s “ready­mades,” or artis­tic provo­ca­tions exe­cut­ed by mod­i­fy­ing and re-con­tex­tu­al­iz­ing found objects.\nNei­ther was sin­gu­lar: just as Duchamp signed mul­ti­ple uri­nals, he also drew (or did­n’t draw) facial hair on mul­ti­ple Mona Lisa post­cards. In one instance, he even gave the okay to his fel­low artist Fran­cis Picabia to make one for pub­li­ca­tion in his mag­a­zine in New York as, nev­er­the­less, “par Mar­cel Duchamp” — though it lacked a goa­tee, an omis­sion the artist cor­rect­ed in his own hand some twen­ty years lat­er.\n\n\n\t\n\nIn the 1956 inter­view just above, Duchamp describes L.H.O.O.Q. as a part of his “Dada peri­od” (and, with char­ac­ter­is­tic mod­esty, “a great icon­o­clas­tic ges­ture on my part”). He also brings out a fake check — belong­ing to “no bank at all” — that he cre­at­ed to use at the den­tist (who accept­ed it); and a sys­tem designed to “break the bank at Monte Car­lo” (which stub­born­ly remained unbro­ken). “I believe that art is the only form of activ­i­ty in which man, as a man, shows him­self to be a true indi­vid­ual, and is capa­ble of going beyond the ani­mal state,” he declares. With his col­li­sion of Jocondisme and Dada, among the oth­er unlike­ly jux­ta­po­si­tions he engi­neered, he showed him­self to be the pre­mier prankster of ear­ly twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry art — and one whose pranks tran­scend­ed amuse­ment to inspire a schol­ar­ly indus­try that per­sists even today.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhat Makes the Mona Lisa a Great Paint­ing: A Deep Dive\nHow Did the Mona Lisa Become the World’s Most Famous Paint­ing?: It’s Not What You Think\nThe Mar­cel Duchamp Research Por­tal Opens, Mak­ing Avail­able 18,000 Doc­u­ments and 50,000 Images Relat­ed to the Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Artist\nHow Mar­cel Duchamp Signed a Uri­nal in 1917 & Rede­fined Art\nWhen Bri­an Eno & Oth­er Artists Peed in Mar­cel Duchamp’s Famous Uri­nal\nSal­vador Dalí Reveals the Secrets of His Trade­mark Mous­tache (1954)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tOctober 30th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nTo many long­time fans, there are — at the very least — two Pink Floyds. The first is the rock band that in 1965 took the name the Pink Floyd Sound, an inven­tion of its newest mem­ber Syd Bar­rett. A gui­tar-play­ing singer-song­writer, the young Bar­rett soon became the group’s guid­ing cre­ative intel­li­gence, albeit of a cracked kind. It was under his influ­ence that, two years lat­er, the Floyd released their first two hit singles,“Arnold Layne” and “See Emi­ly Play,” as well as their debut stu­dio album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This ear­ly mate­r­i­al exhibits a kind of dark­ly whim­si­cal Eng­lish eccen­tric­i­ty that turned out to fit neat­ly indeed with the psy­che­delia of the music-dri­ven late-six­ties coun­ter­cul­ture.\nThis first Pink Floyd last­ed until part­way through the pro­duc­tion of their sec­ond album, A Saucer­ful of Secrets. Up to that point, Bar­ret­t’s behav­ior had been turn­ing ever stranger and less man­age­able; even­tu­al­ly, he passed entire con­certs in a state of near cata­to­nia onstage (with the occa­sion­al spasm of a deep-seat­ed ten­den­cy to prac­ti­cal jokes).\nAfter con­sid­er­ing and find­ing unfea­si­ble the option to retain him as a non-tour­ing con­trib­u­tor, the oth­er mem­bers decid­ed sim­ply to eject him from the band. Thus began the Floy­d’s sec­ond iter­a­tion, which, despite the loss of the man who’d been writ­ing 90 per­cent of their songs, did nev­er­the­less man­age to come up with albums like Atom Heart Moth­er, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall.\nWhen Bar­rett died in 2006, after decades of life as a recluse (and, ever the Eng­lish­man, an enthu­si­as­tic gar­den­er), he was wide­ly remem­bered as a casu­al­ty of the psy­che­del­ic drug wave. But accord­ing to Roger Waters, who took the band’s reins, “LSD was not sole­ly respon­si­ble for Syd’s ill­ness.” He says so in the video above, a com­pi­la­tion of his rec­ol­lec­tions of Bar­ret­t’s decline. “It felt to me at the time that Syd was drift­ing off the rails, and when you’re drift­ing off the rails, the worst thing you could do is start mess­ing around with hal­lu­cino­gen­ics.” There was “no doubt that Syd was schiz­o­phrenic, and that he was tak­ing those drugs at the same time.” It could well have been that Bar­ret­t’s state of mind allowed him to voy­age into realms that the Floyd could oth­er­wise nev­er have accessed. But what­ev­er the causal fac­tors and their pro­por­tions, he even­tu­al­ly found him­self unable to come back home.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nPsy­che­del­ic Scenes of Pink Floyd’s Ear­ly Days with Syd Bar­rett, 1967\nUnder­stand­ing Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here, Their Trib­ute to Depart­ed Band­mate Syd Bar­rett\nShort Film “Syd Barrett’s First Trip” Reveals the Pink Floyd Founder’s Psy­che­del­ic Exper­i­men­ta­tion (1967)\nWatch David Gilmour Play the Songs of Syd Bar­rett, with the Help of David Bowie & Richard Wright\nAn Hour-Long Col­lec­tion of Live Footage Doc­u­ments the Ear­ly Days of Pink Floyd (1967–1972)\nThe Inven­tive Art­work of Pink Floyd’s Syd Bar­rett\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tOctober 29th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWe all know the man­child Mozart of Milos Forman’s 1984 biopic Amadeus. As embod­ied by a man­ic, bray­ing Thomas Hulce, the pre­co­cious and haunt­ed com­pos­er sup­pos­ed­ly loved noth­ing more than scan­dal­iz­ing, amus­ing, or exas­per­at­ing friends and ene­mies alike with juve­nile pranks and scat­o­log­i­cal humor. Sure­ly a fic­tion, eh? Gross exag­ger­a­tion, no? Undoubt­ed­ly Mozart com­port­ed him­self with more dig­ni­ty? Those famil­iar with the composer’s biog­ra­phy know oth­er­wise.\nWe have, for exam­ple, a ridicu­lous­ly dirty let­ter that the 21-year-old “poop-lov­ing musi­cal genius” wrote to his 19-year-old cousin Marianne—a mis­sive Let­ters of Note pref­aces with the dis­claimer “if you’re eas­i­ly offend­ed, please do not read any fur­ther” (oh, but how can you resist?). This piece of cor­re­spon­dence is but one of many “shock­ing­ly crude let­ters” Mozart wrote to his fam­i­ly. And if these slight­ly insane doc­u­ments don’t con­vince you, we offer as fur­ther evi­dence of Mozart’s exu­ber­ant­ly child­ish sen­si­bil­i­ty the above canon in B flat for six voic­es, Leck Mich Im Arsch, which trans­lates rough­ly to “Kiss My Ass.”\nOne of three naughty canons com­posed in 1782 with lyrics like “Good night, sleep tight, / And stick your ass to your mouth,” this piece was dis­cov­ered in 1991 at Har­vard Uni­ver­si­ty. Har­vard librar­i­an Michael Ochs, with a clear pen­chant for under­state­ment, said at the time: “These are minor works. They’re not the Requiem, or ‘Don Gio­van­ni.’ They were writ­ten for the amuse­ment of Mozart and his friends, and they show anoth­er side of him.” The first edi­tion of Mozart’s com­plete works, pub­lished in 1804, bowd­ler­ized the texts and removed the racy humor, chang­ing the title of Leck Mich Im Arsch to “Let us be glad!”—likely, writes Lucas Reil­ly at Men­tal Floss, “the com­plete oppo­site of what this tune means.”\nReil­ly also points out that Mozart’s “pot­ty mouth” was prob­a­bly not, as some have sup­posed, evi­dence of Tourette’s syn­drome, but rather of an espe­cial­ly strong cur­rent in Ger­man humor, shared by Johannes Guten­berg, Mar­tin Luther, and Mozart’s equal­ly bril­liant con­tem­po­rary, Johann Wolf­gang von Goethe. In fact, Leck Mich Im Arsch alludes to Goethe’s seri­ous dra­mat­ic work, Götz Von Berlichin­gen. The cho­rus reads as fol­lows in Eng­lish:\nKiss my arse!\n Goethe, Goethe!\n Götz von Berlichin­gen! Sec­ond act;\n You know the scene too well!\n Let’s sing out now sum­mar­i­ly:\n Here is Mozart lit­er­ary!\nHear two addi­tion­al dirty choral pieces—Bona Nox and Dif­fi­cile Lec­tu—at Men­tal Floss. Some oth­er scat­o­log­i­cal canons thought to be Mozart’s, such as Leck mir den Arsch fein recht schön sauber (“Lick my ass right well and clean”), have since been attrib­uted to ama­teur com­pos­er and physi­cian Wen­zel Trn­ka, yet it appears that the three fea­tured at Men­tal Floss are gen­uine.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHear the Pieces Mozart Com­posed When He Was Only 5 Years Old\nWatch the First Per­for­mance of a Mozart Com­po­si­tion That Had Been Lost for Cen­turies\nSee Mozart Played on Mozart’s Own Fortepi­ano, the Instru­ment That Most Authen­ti­cal­ly Cap­tures the Sound of His Music\nHear the Sounds of the Actu­al Instru­ments for Which Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Han­del Orig­i­nal­ly Com­posed Their Music\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThroughout her practice, Renée Condo draws on the philosophical tenets of her Mi’gmaq ancestry. The Montreal-based artist works with wooden beads that she sands, paints in bold acrylic, and nests into energetic compositions depicting juicy fruits, raindrops, and brilliant, golden suns.\nCondo is interested in mntu, or spirit, and what she refers to as heart knowledge, acts that emerge from empathy and love. Through sculptural pieces that emphasize interconnection and flow, the artist draws on Indigenous creation stories and myths, considering her beadwork a reimagining of various traditions.\n“Giju'” (2024), wood beads, acrylic paint, epoxy on wood panel, 72 × 60 inches\nCondo often engages the relationship between the component and composition, emphasizing the ways in which a singular piece would appear abstract without a broader context. “The bead as fundamental entity, as infinite potentiality, can appear as divided, as unit, as part,” she says, “but is at once whole and all-encompassing, holding secrets of the world and to the nature of reality.”\nThis fall, Condo will have work on view at GAVLAK, where she’s represented.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAs a communication designer, Kelli Anderson began her career in information design. “The act of data visualization is all about bringing facts from the abstract and numerical realm into the sphere of perception, so you can see them,” she says in a video on Kickstarter. “And I thought, why stop there? What if you could also feel and experience those facts?”\nLast year, Anderson launched a remarkable, five-years-in-the-making project called Alphabet in Motion: How Letters Get Their Shape, an ABC pop-up book about typography. She spent thousands of hours researching design archives and meticulously engineering kinetic and three-dimensional letters to show how type styles have evolved through the ages.\n\n“If you look carefully at letters, you can see a secret history of the world—from the Bronze Age to the Information Age,” Anderson says. “But because many of these methods, tools, and machines are now obsolete, this history is challenging to follow. Alphabet in Motion leverages tactile, interactive features to help clarify how letters have transformed alongside technological upheavals and shifting aesthetic moods.”\nThe project is composed of two conjoined, detachable books. The pop-up section includes an interactive, seven-segment display cover that changes from A to Z, 17 moveable paper elements, and hands-on activities. The accompanying 128-page section contains an essay diving into the history and concept of each pop-up, plus 300 color images from the history of type design.\nAnderson’s book originally funded on Kickstarter and is now being released more widely. Secure your copy in the Colossal Shop. Follow along with her work on Instagram, and you might also enjoy another of her projects, This Book Is a Camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson working on an engineered paper element for ‘Alphabet in Motion’\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom feminist activist Angela Davis to iconic symbols of peace amid political upheaval, Shepard Fairey is known for his bold illustrations and instantly recognizable posters. He rose to prominence within the world of street art and skateboarding culture, creating a sticker in 1989 with the phrase “Andre the Giant has a posse,” which was distributed widely and led to a recurring motif of the wrestler’s face on dozens of subsequent prints.\nFairey’s graphic motifs hit the mainstream in 2008 during Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, in which his portrait sits above the word “hope.” The optimistic work exemplifies how grassroots activism, especially through the form of printing and sharing imagery, can become iconic and have immense influence.\n“Afrocentric (Red)” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\nOut of Print, a retrospective of Fairey’s work presented by Beyond the Streets, celebrates what the gallery calls “the rebellious, democratic force of ink and paper.” More than 400 prints designed over the past few decades are joined by new works. Many of the posters emphasize his interest in activism, empowerment, and protest. His subversive practice, known as Obey Giant, even has a slogan: “Manufacturing quality dissent since 1989.”\nFairey often incorporates the color schemes and modernist, graphic motifs of early 20th-century propaganda posters, especially of the Soviet Union. By incorporating design motifs associated with fascism into messages of peace, feminism, love, and democracy, he reinforces the power of the medium. “Some people say digital media has ended print, but the provocative, tactile experience of a print on a wall or in the wild can’t be replaced,” Fairey says. “Printing still matters!”\nThe exhibition runs from November 15 to January 11 in Los Angeles. Learn more on the gallery’s website, follow updates on Fairey’s Instagram, and purchase prints in his shop.\n“Fist” (2000), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Visual Disobedience” (2004), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“War For Sale (Red)” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“High Time for Peace” (2005), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Guns and Roses” (2006), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Mujer Fatale” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n“Panther Power” (2007), screenprint on paper, 24 x 18 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

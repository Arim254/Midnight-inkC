    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tJanuary 15th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nThink back, if you will, to the works of art you cre­at­ed at age twelve or thir­teen. For many, per­haps most of us, our out­put at that stage of ado­les­cence amount­ed to direc­tion­less doo­dles, chaot­ic comics, and a few unsteady-at-best school projects. But then, most of us did­n’t grow up to be Michelan­ge­lo. In the late four­teen-eight­ies, when that tow­er­ing Renais­sance artist was still what we would now call a “tween,” he paint­ed The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny, a depic­tion of the tit­u­lar reli­gious fig­ure beset by demons in the desert. Though based on a wide­ly known engrav­ing, it nev­er­the­less shows evi­dence of rapid­ly advanc­ing tech­nique, inspi­ra­tion, and even cre­ativ­i­ty — espe­cial­ly when placed under the infrared scan­ner.\nFor about half a mil­len­ni­um, The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny was­n’t thought to have been paint­ed by Michelan­ge­lo. As explained in the video from Inspi­rag­gio just below, when the paint­ing sold at Sothe­by’s in 2008, the buy­er took it to the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Muse­um of Art for exam­i­na­tion and clean­ing.\n“Beneath the lay­ers of dirt accu­mu­lat­ed over the cen­turies,” says the nar­ra­tor, “a very par­tic­u­lar col­or palette appeared. “The tones, the blends, the way the human fig­ure was treat­ed: all of it began to resem­ble the style Michelan­ge­lo would use years lat­er in none oth­er than the Sis­tine Chapel.” Infrared reflec­tog­ra­phy sub­se­quent­ly turned up pen­ti­men­ti, or cor­rec­tion marks, a com­mon indi­ca­tion that “a paint­ing is not a copy, but an orig­i­nal work cre­at­ed with artis­tic free­dom.”\n\n\n\t\n\nIt was the Kim­bell Art Muse­um in Fort Worth, Texas that first bet big on the prove­nance of The Tor­ment of Saint Antho­ny. Its new­ly hired direc­tor pur­chased the paint­ing after turn­ing up “not a sin­gle con­vinc­ing argu­ment against the attri­bu­tion.” Thus acquired, it became “the only paint­ing by Michelan­ge­lo locat­ed any­where in the Amer­i­c­as, and also just one of four easel paint­ings attrib­uted to him through­out his entire career,” dur­ing most of which he dis­par­aged oil paint­ing itself. About a decade lat­er, and after fur­ther analy­sis, the art his­to­ri­an Gior­gio Bon­san­ti put his con­sid­er­able author­i­ty behind a defin­i­tive con­fir­ma­tion that it is indeed the work of the young Michelan­ge­lo. There remain doubters, of course, and even the noto­ri­ous­ly uncom­pro­mis­ing artist him­self may have con­sid­ered it an imma­ture work unwor­thy of his name.

    "body": "\n\tin Music, Television |   \tJanuary 16th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nMTV still exists. At least, it still exists in the Unit­ed States, or in cer­tain of that coun­try’s mar­kets, for the time being. A flur­ry of pre­ma­ture obit­u­ar­ies recent­ly blew through the inter­net after the announce­ment that the net­work had shut down in oth­er parts of the world, Europe includ­ed. But even there, some expressed the sen­ti­ment that MTV had already died long before. And indeed, in the U.S., where it orig­i­nal­ly launched, ask­ing who remem­bers when MTV actu­al­ly used to play music videos has been a com­mon lament for decades, aired even by gen­er­a­tions too young to remem­ber those days them­selves. But mem­bers of any gen­er­a­tion can now relive them — or live them for the first time — through a new site called MTV Rewind.\nThe first music video that greets the vis­i­tor is The Bug­gles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star,” and appro­pri­ate­ly so, since it inau­gu­rat­ed MTV itself when it went live on August 1st, 1981. What fol­lows are all the rest of the videos played on that first day, like Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight,” Blondie’s “Rap­ture,” David Bowie’s “Boys Keep Swing­ing,” and Kate Bush’s “Wuther­ing Heights.”\n(Oth­er, less wide­ly remem­bered entries include no few­er than three songs by Cliff Richard, which speaks to the then-incom­plete for­ma­tion of the kind of pop-musi­cal cul­ture we still asso­ciate with MTV.) The site’s oth­er playlists recre­ate oth­er eras and genre-spe­cif­ic pro­grams, from 120 Min­utes to Total Request Live, Head­banger’s Ball to Yo! MTV Raps.\nCur­rent­ly, MTV Rewind’s music video count comes to about 40,000, enough to ensure any for­mer addict of the net­work a stream of nos­tal­gia hits. But the site’s cre­ator (a 43-year-old Amer­i­can res­i­dent in Alba­nia, accord­ing to the New York Times, known pseu­do­ny­mous­ly as “Flex”) has also incor­po­rat­ed vin­tage sta­tion IDs and com­mer­cials, many of them liable to trig­ger down­right Prous­t­ian sen­sa­tions in the right view­er. What may feel refresh­ing even to curi­ous younger vis­i­tors is that, whichev­er chan­nel they choose, the next video that plays is deter­mined not by an algo­rithm attempt­ing to pre­dict their per­son­al tastes. Rather, each playlist is shaped by the pop­u­lar cul­ture of a par­tic­u­lar era, with enough left-field selec­tions to keep it inter­est­ing: just the sort of thing in hopes of which we used to flip over to MTV, back when the idea of stream­ing video on our com­put­ers still sound­ed like sheer­est fan­ta­sy.

When alarmed, they imme­di­ate­ly take refuge in their sub­ter­ranean cham­bers; or, if the dread­ed dan­ger be not imme­di­ate­ly impend­ing, they stand near the brink of the entrance, brave­ly bark­ing and flour­ish­ing their tails, or else sit erect to recon­noitre the move­ments of the ene­my.\nThe notes of ornithol­o­gist John Kirk Townsend (1809 – 1851) sug­gest that not every­one was as tak­en with the species as Say (who was, in all fair­ness, the father of Amer­i­can ento­mol­o­gy):\nNoth­ing can be more unpleas­ant than the bag­ging of this species, on account of the fleas with which their plumage swarms, and which in all prob­a­bil­i­ty have been left in the bur­row by the Bad­ger or Mar­mot, at the time it was aban­doned by these ani­mals. I know of no oth­er bird infest­ed by that kind of ver­min. \n\nThe Com­mon Gallinule, above, sug­gests that there’s often more to these birds than meets the eye. His some­what sheep­ish look­ing coun­te­nance belies the red hot love life Audubon recounts:\n… the man­i­fes­ta­tions of their ama­to­ry propen­si­ty were quite remark­able. The male birds court­ed the females, both on the land and on the water; they fre­quent­ly spread out their tail like a fan, and moved round each oth­er, emit­ting a mur­mur­ing sound for some sec­onds. The female would after­wards walk to the water’s edge, stand in the water up to her breast, and receive the caress­es of the male, who imme­di­ate­ly after would strut on the water before her, jerk­ing with rapid­i­ty his spread tail for awhile, after which they would both resume their ordi­nary occu­pa­tions.\n\nBeing that we are firm­ly plant­ed in the sec­ond type of bird lover’s camp, this ornitho­log­i­cal cor­nu­copia main­ly serves to whet our appetite for more Falseknees, self-described bird nerd Joshua Barkman’s beau­ti­ful­ly ren­dered web­com­ic.\nYes, Audubon’s Indi­go Bird, aka Petit Pape­bleu, “an active and live­ly lit­tle fel­low” who “pos­sess­es much ele­gance in his shape, and also a cer­tain degree of firm­ness in his make” was sep­a­rat­ed by a cen­tu­ry or so from “Mood Indi­go”—we pre­sume that’s the tune stuck in Barkman’s bird’s head—but he does look rather pre­oc­cu­pied, no?\nPos­si­bly just think­ing of meal­worms…\nExplore Audubon’s Birds of Amer­i­ca by chrono­log­i­cal or alpha­bet­i­cal order, or by state, and down­load them all for free here.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nCor­nell Launch­es Archive of 150,000 Bird Calls and Ani­mal Sounds, with Record­ings Going Back to 1929\nA Lav­ish­ly Illus­trat­ed Cat­a­log of All Hum­ming­bird Species Known in the 19th Cen­tu­ry Gets Restored & Put Online\nWhat Kind of Bird Is That?: A Free App From Cor­nell Will Give You the Answer\nExplore an Inter­ac­tive Ver­sion of The Wall of Birds, a 2,500 Square-Foot Mur­al That Doc­u­ments the Evo­lu­tion of Birds Over 375 Mil­lion Years\nThe Bird Library: A Library Built Espe­cial­ly for Our Fine Feath­ered Friends\nAyun Hal­l­i­day is an author, illus­tra­tor, and the­ater mak­er in NYC.\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nBefore he was a titan of Renaissance art history, Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) was a 12-year-old, although his childhood looked quite a bit different from what we associate with that age today. Already deeply invested in drawing and painting, he studied others’ work, such as an engraving titled “Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons,” created by 15th-century German artist Martin Schongauer. Unlike most tweens, though, when he set out to recreate the scene in tempera paint on a wood panel, he worked with a particular style that strongly hinted at the young boy’s preternatural talent.\nThis is the very first known painting by Michelangelo, titled “The Torment of Saint Anthony,” which was completed around 1487-88 at the age of 12 or 13. It wasn’t attributed to him until after the painting sold at auction in 2008 and a conservationist at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York removed yellowed varnish and some unskillful overpaint to reveal a unique color palette and attention to depth.\n\nArt historians such as Everett Fahy, a longtime curator at The Met, asserted that the painting had been made by Michelangelo, even though when the work went to auction, it was attributed more generally to the large Florentine workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, with which Michelangelo joined as an apprentice in 1488.\nFahy’s convictions were bolstered by the unique composition that emerged after its restoration at the hands of conservator Michael Gallagher, backed by art historian and restorer Giorgio Bonsanti’s expert opinion that it was indeed made by Michelangelo.\nWith no one else able (at least yet) to provide credible enough evidence that it was not, the work was acquired by the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, making it the only painting by the Renaissance master in a public collection in North America.\n“The rare subject is found in the life of Saint Anthony the Great, written by Athanasius of Alexandria in the 4th century, which describes how the Egyptian hermit-saint had a vision that he levitated into the air and was attacked by demons, whose torments he withstood,” says the Kimbell, adding that historians like Ascanio Condivi and Giorgio Vasari—Michelangelo’s contemporaries—recounted that “to give the demonic creatures veracity, he studied the colorful scales and other parts of specimens from the fish market.”\n\nIt’s possible that the famously exacting Michelangelo wouldn’t have chosen to have his name associated with this “amateur” work, which may help explain its attribution to the workshop instead. But for art historians and enthusiasts alike, it’s a wonderful insight into some of the artist’s earliest creative explorations. \nBelow, enjoy a video from art historian Erick Giraldo, who runs a channel called Inspiraggio on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen a 65-year-old tree succumbed to a fungus known as oak wilt, Steve Parker wanted to pay tribute. The wooded habitat had previously loomed above Parker’s front yard and provided refuge to migratory birds. Rather than turn its limbs and trunk into mulch, though, Parker did as he often does with a material that’s no longer primed for its original purpose: he created a sound sculpture.\nRecently on view at Ivester Contemporary in Austin, “Funeral for a Tree” is a sprawling and poetic ode to the oak. Parker cut slices from the trunk that he then carved like vinyl, encoding bird song into the grain. When placed on a Victrola-style turntable, the records play the avian soundscapes.\n\n\n\nTo accompany these dirges, Parker also constructed a suspended brass and copper sculpture with tubing that splays like roots, some of which display blue-bag ventilators at their tips. These medical devices appear alongside CPAP machines in another installation of bark-clad limbs and vintage instruments known as shengs sourced from a Taipei flea market. \nEmphasizing breath and the rhythmic pulse of life, these additions also reference the artist’s late father. “The project emerged from Parker’s recognition that his grief for the tree echoed the loss of his father to cancer—both slow, inevitable declines where care could not prevent loss,” a statement says.\nWatch “Funeral for a Tree” in the video above, and find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn her uncanny visages and sculptures, Malene Hartmann Rasmussen taps the ceramic medium as a form of make-believe. Surreal folkloric creatures take on absurd, sometimes cartoonish personalities, assembled from disparate plants and critters or reflecting characterful, mask-like qualities.\nIn Rasmussen’s playfully monstrous “Egg-head,” for example, silly antics are equally unsettling—what’s in its mouth? Where is the rest of its body? And “Inner Beast #10” gives a disgusted side-eye that’s open to interpretation. What does it find so offensive?\n“Egg-head” (2025), glazed stoneware, 24-carat gold luster, 37 x 27 x 21 centimeters\nBy disturbing the boundaries between cuteness and abjection and the playful and unsettling, the artist invokes the power of imagination and the enigmatic atmosphere of fairytales. Her ongoing Trolls series combines natural objects like snail shells, eggs, leaves, and flowers into sage mysterious faces that give little indication of whether they’re well-meaning or not.\nStarting tomorrow, find these works alongside paintings James Mortimer in the exhibition Brutes at James Freeman Gallery, which continues through February 14 in London.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom figures with multiple legs and noodles for arms to frolicking trees, Paco Pomet summons the absurd. Known for his uncanny oil paintings rendered mostly in monochrome and enlivened by colorful details of overly stretchy limbs or celestial objects, a sense of nostalgia greets surreal scenarios. The artist often derives his imagery from vintage black-and-white photographs, adding an absurd dimension to history.\nPomet’s work is currently on view in a solo exhibition titled Planet Circus at Richard Heller Gallery, which continues through February 14 in Santa Monica.

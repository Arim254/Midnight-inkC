For those of us with long mem­o­ries of com­put­er and video gam­ing, it brought to mind a title we had­n’t thought about in quite some time: <em>Omikron: The Nomad Soul</em>, released for Win­dows in 1999 and the Sega Dream­cast in 2000. More than a few gamers know it as the debut of con­tro­ver­sial design­er David Cage, whose stu­dio Quan­tic Dream has gone on to pro­duce var­i­ous games of con­sid­er­able cin­e­mat­ic and emo­tion­al ambit (if also an often frus­trat­ing eccen­tric­i­ty). But it made a wider cul­tur­al impact at the time by incor­po­rat­ing the per­for­mance of none oth­er than David Bowie.</p>\n<p>Or rather, it incor­po­rat­ed per­for­mances, plur­al, by David Bowie: in the game, he used motion cap­ture tech­nol­o­gy to play both Boz, the whol­ly dig­i­tal leader of an ancient reli­gious order, and the lead singer of the band The Dream­ers, whose con­certs (shown in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-0okqYM5s4\">the video above</a>) the play­er can view here and there around the dystopi­an cyber­punk city of Omikron.</p>\n<p>Orig­i­nal­ly, the devel­op­ers had only gone to Bowie in order to license his songs for the game’s sound­track, but, as explained in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TReGH6rZrE\">the mrixrt video below</a>, the project so appealed to his technophil­ia that he pro­posed a much deep­er involve­ment. That includ­ed record­ing a set of orig­i­nal songs, lat­er includ­ed on his album <em>Hours… </em>(which is itself notable in the his­to­ry of tech­nol­o­gy and cul­ture for being one of the first down­load­able releas­es by a major artist).</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-TReGH6rZrE?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>Among its many nov­el qual­i­ties, includ­ing pio­neer­ing the “open world” envi­ron­ment now stan­dard in big-bud­get games, <em>Omikron </em>grants the play­er — as the tit­u­lar “nomad soul” — the abil­i­ty to inhab­it the bod­ies of a host of oth­er char­ac­ters (includ­ing one played by Bowie’s wife Iman). It isn’t hard to imag­ine the con­cep­t’s appeal for a per­former who made his name with fre­quent changes of iden­ti­ty — and who even sug­gest­ed, at one point, that he leave that name behind in the real­i­ty of the game, re-emerg­ing into pub­lic life as David Jones. By the time he died, the bet­ter part of two decades lat­er, his role in gam­ing was most­ly for­got­ten, but one of the many trib­utes paid to him includ­ed a free re-release of <em>Omikron</em>. Those who took the chance to revis­it the game would have remem­bered the feel­ing it first gave them that its dig­i­tal world con­tin­ued even when they weren’t play­ing — accom­pa­nied by a sense that, some­how, Bowie con­tin­ues to live with­in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/04/when-david-bowie-launched-his-own-internet-service-provider.html\">When David Bowie Launched His Own Inter­net Ser­vice Provider: The Rise and Fall of BowieNet (1998)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/09/a-tour-of-the-new-david-bowie-archive-featuring-90000-artifacts-from-his-life-career.html\">A Tour of the New David Bowie Archive Fea­tur­ing 90,000 Arti­facts from His Life & Career</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/05/how-david-bowie-used-william-s-burroughs-cut-up-method-to-write-his-unforgettable-lyrics.html\">How David Bowie Used William S.

Few of us who can explain the the­o­ry of rel­a­tiv­i­ty can also say much about the per­son­al life of the man who came up with it, though that does­n’t owe to a lack of doc­u­men­ta­tion. Thanks to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDOWMgnWppA\">sci­ence YouTu­ber Toby Hendy</a>, we have, for exam­ple, some of the love let­ters he wrote to the women who con­sti­tut­ed a ver­i­ta­ble parade through his life. Also, in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Y-XGcBwWc\">anoth­er video for her chan­nel Tibees</a>, Hendy reads the let­ters he wrote in the process of divorc­ing his first wife, the Ser­bian physi­cist and math­e­mati­cian <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mileva_Mari%C4%87\">Mil­e­va Mar­ić</a>.</p>\n<p>Ein­stein mar­ried Mar­ić in Jan­u­ary 1903, says Hendy, “after they had been togeth­er for around five years. The rela­tion­ship was in its prime, and so was the aca­d­e­m­ic pro­duc­tiv­i­ty. It was in 1905 that Ein­stein would pub­lish his four major papers that would change the face of physics. By 1912, how­ev­er, Ein­stein had start­ed hav­ing an affair with his cousin,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Einstein\">Elsa Lowen­thal</a>.</p>\n<p>By 1914, Ein­stein wrote to Mar­ić <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/12/albert-einstein-imposes-on-his-first-wife-a-cruel-list-of-marital-demands.html\">a let­ter</a> “detail­ing some con­di­tions of them con­tin­u­ing to live togeth­er,” if not quite as man and wife. The con­di­tions read as fol­lows:</p>\n<p><em>CONDITIONS</em></p>\n<p><em>A. You will make sure:</em></p>\n<p><em>1. that my clothes and laun­dry are kept in good order;</em><br />\n<em> 2. that I will receive my three meals reg­u­lar­ly in my room;</em><br />\n<em> 3. that my bed­room and study are kept neat, and espe­cial­ly that my desk is left for my use only.</em></p>\n<p><em>B. You will renounce all per­son­al rela­tions with me inso­far as they are not com­plete­ly nec­es­sary for social rea­sons. Specif­i­cal­ly, You will forego:</em></p>\n<p><em>1. my sit­ting at home with you;</em><br />\n<em> 2. my going out or trav­el­ling with you.</em></p>\n<p><em>C. You will obey the fol­low­ing points in your rela­tions with me:</em></p>\n<p><em>1. you will not expect any inti­ma­cy from me, nor will you reproach me in any way;</em><br />\n<em> 2. you will stop talk­ing to me if I request it;</em><br />\n<em> 3. you will leave my bed­room or study imme­di­ate­ly with­out protest if I request it.</em></p>\n<p><em>D. You will under­take not to belit­tle me in front of our chil­dren, either through words or behav­ior.</em></p>\n<p>Though they agreed to put this strin­gent plan into effect, less than two weeks lat­er, he wrote to Elsa, “Yes­ter­day my wife left for good with the chil­dren” — and “you, dear lit­tle Elsie, will now become my wife and become con­vinced that it is not at all so hard to live by my side.”</p>\n<p>Ein­stein did mar­ry Lowen­thal in 1919, and the union, though hard­ly char­ac­ter­ized by ide­al faith­ful­ness, did last until her death in 1935. There would be plen­ty of oth­er women, but none who played quite the same role in his life as Mar­ić, not only the moth­er of his chil­dren, but also — accord­ing to some his­to­ri­ans — a col­lab­o­ra­tor on some of his accom­plish­ments in physics. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lostwomenofscience.org/post/does-mileva-einstein-maric-deserve-credit-for-albert-einsteins-discoveries\">Accord­ing to Lost Women of Sci­ence</a>, “there is lit­tle tan­gi­ble evi­dence to sup­port the claims that Mar­ić was a co-author of Einstein’s first major work. That said, there are plen­ty of per­son­al tes­ti­monies from those who knew Mar­ić and Ein­stein that her involve­ment was like­ly.” One con­di­tion of their divorce set­tle­ment, at any rate, held that Mar­ić receive his Nobel Prize mon­ey, were he to win it, which he went on to do a cou­ple of years lat­er. This makes clear that, what­ev­er the impor­tance of her own sci­en­tif­ic work, she must’ve had a good head on her shoul­ders.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/10/hear-readings-of-albert-einsteins-spicy-love-letters.html\">Hear Read­ings of Albert Einstein’s Love Let­ters (and Chilly Divorce Let­ters) to His First Wife Mil­e­va</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/12/albert-einstein-imposes-on-his-first-wife-a-cruel-list-of-marital-demands.html\">Albert Ein­stein Impos­es on His First Wife a Cru­el List of Mar­i­tal Demands</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2015/09/albert-einstein-sigmund-freud-exchange-letters.html\">Albert Ein­stein & Sig­mund Freud Exchange Let­ters and Debate How to Make the World Free from War (1932)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/12/read-the-dont-let-the-bastards-get-you-down-letter-that-albert-einstein-sent-to-marie-curie-during-a-time-of-personal-crisis-1911.html\">Read the Uplift­ing Let­ter That Albert Ein­stein Sent to Marie Curie Dur­ing a Time of Per­son­al Cri­sis (1911)</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2012/08/do_scientists_pray_einstein_responds.html\">“Do Sci­en­tists Pray?”: A Young Girl Asks Albert Ein­stein in 1936.

Antho­ny Burgess’ har­row­ing, lin­guis­ti­cal­ly inven­tive nov­el of a grim near future has come out on top in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pen.org/banned-books-list-2025/\">PEN Amer­i­ca’s lat­est rank­ing of banned books</a>: that is, books removed or pre­vent­ed even from enter­ing pub­lic school libraries, most com­mon­ly in the state of Flori­da, with Texas and Ten­nessee as run­ners-up. Fur­ther down the list appears anoth­er wide­ly known dystopi­an saga, Mar­garet Atwood’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4oc8i6x\"><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></a>; Toni Mor­rison’s tale of Depres­sion-era race rela­tions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4nBZyGG\"><em>The Bluest Eye</em></a>; and even such long-pop­u­lar “young adult” stan­dards as Judy Blume’s <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/42uR1wW\">For­ev­er</a>…</em> and Stephen Chbosky’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/42w4NPP\"><em>The Perks of Being a Wall­flower</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Since its pub­li­ca­tion in 1962, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3IJzMRV\"><em>A Clock­work</em> <em>Orange</em></a> has faced mul­ti­ple book ban­ning attempts due to the sex­u­al vio­lence it depicts,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bannedbooks.library.cmu.edu/a-clockwork-orange/\">says Carnegie Mel­lon Uni­ver­si­ty’s Banned Books Project</a>. “In 1973, a book­seller in Orem, Utah, was arrest­ed for sell­ing the nov­el along with two oth­er ‘obscene’ books.”</p>\n<p>Bans fol­lowed “in 1976 in Auro­ra, Col­orado, in 1977 in West­port, Con­necti­cut, and in 1982 in Annis­ton, Alaba­ma. As recent­ly as 2019, mem­bers of the Flori­da Cit­i­zens Alliance” — in yet anoth­er exam­ple of the sur­pris­ing ten­den­cy toward cul­tur­al author­i­tar­i­an­ism in the Sun­shine State — “have lob­bied to ban the book along with almost one hun­dred oth­er ‘porno­graph­ic’ nov­els.”</p>\n<p>The noto­ri­ety of <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3IJzMRV\">A Clock­work Orange</a> </em>in this regard prob­a­bly owes some­thing to the steely lurid­ness of Stan­ley Kubrick­’s film adap­ta­tion, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/when-stanley-kubrick-banned-a-clockwork-orange.html\">which was banned in Eng­land by Kubrick him­self</a>. It makes, in any case, for an iron­ic object of a book ban, giv­en its themes. Burgess was inspired to write this nov­el of juve­nile ultra-delin­quen­cy, as he explains in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jYOqu4b9BY\">the inter­view clip above</a>, by “talk in the nine­teen-six­ties of the pos­si­bil­i­ty of get­ting these young thugs and not putting them in jail, because jail is need­ed for pro­fes­sion­al crim­i­nals, but rather putting them through a course of con­di­tion­ing” to make them behave less like organ­isms than machines: the “clock­work oranges” of the title. The state, it seemed, “was all too ready to take over our brains and turn us into good lit­tle cit­i­zens with­out the pow­er of choice” — a process that plau­si­bly begins by restrict­ing the choice of read­ing mate­r­i­al.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/03/anthony-burgess-lists-his-five-favorite-dystopian-novels.html\"><em>A Clock­work Orange</em> Author Antho­ny Burgess Lists His Five Favorite Dystopi­an Nov­els: Orwell’s 1984, Huxley’s Island & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2016/10/anthony-burgess-names-the-99-best-novels-in-english.html\">Antho­ny Burgess Names the 99 Best Nov­els in Eng­lish Between 1939 & 1983: Orwell, Nabokov, Hux­ley & More</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/02/why-maya-angelous-memoir-i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-became-one-of-the-most-banned-books-of-all-time.html\">Why Maya Angelou’s Mem­oir <em>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</em> Became One of the Most Banned Books of All Time</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/01/the-brooklyn-public-library-gives-every-teenager-in-the-u-s-free-access-to-censored-books.html\">The Brook­lyn Pub­lic Library Gives Every Teenag­er in the U.S. Free Access to Cen­sored Books</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2021/09/americas-first-banned-book-discover-the-1637-book-that-mocked-the-puritans.html\">America’s First Banned Book: Dis­cov­er the 1637 Book That Mocked the Puri­tans</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2022/04/the-new-york-public-library-provides-free-online-access-to-four-banned-books-catcher-in-the-rye-stamped-more.html\">The New York Pub­lic Library Pro­vides Free Online Access to Banned Books: <em>Catch­er in the Rye</em>, <em>Stamped</em> & More</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In the northeastern London borough of Redbridge, a community arts program has transformed a simple electric truck into a vibrant, mobile artwork. Clad in richly embellished metal panels, the touring project is titled “Home Away from Home” and is inspired by the vivid, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/08/christopher-herwig-trucks-tuks/\">hand-embellished trucks</a> found in South Asia, especially around Pakistan and India.</p>\n<p>“Home Away from Home” is the final installment of a broader series of social art presentations called <em>Other Worlds</em>, organized by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://coloursofredbridge.com/\">Colours of Redbridge</a>. The local charity is part of a broader Arts Council England program called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/creative-people-and-places-0\">Creative People and Places</a>, which focuses on bringing arts and culture to communities where involvement in mainstream culture and creative expression is low relative to others.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4.jpg\" alt=\"a detail of the front of a colorful van that has been transformed into an artwork\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-640x406.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-960x609.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-768x487.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/art-truck-4-1536x974.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>The ornate truck was “designed by local groups to reflect what home means to them, exploring local heritage and identity in Redbridge, East London,” the organization says. “Bespoke panels reflect different themes such as music, sports, local landmarks, pets, and food—all of which are important to local community members and where they live.”</p>\n<p>Abid Bhai, an accomplished truck artist, created the panels in Pakistan, then shipped them to the U.K., where local blacksmith Felicity Jones affixed the colorful elements to the sides, top, and even the wheels. London-based artists Momtaz Begum-Hossain, Sheyamali Sudesh, and Bailes+Light were also instrumental in the collaborative work. “I’ve especially loved running the community metal workshops, where participants poured their own ideas into custom panel designs,” Jones says.”Seeing people grow in confidence and express themselves creatively through metalwork has been a real highlight.”</p>\n<p>Both Colours and Redbridge and Creative People and Places aim to not only break down barriers to the arts but to listen to residents’ real needs and wants. The overarching goal is to build and sustain healthier and happier communities. Through public engagement, the Colours of Redbridge also adheres to a mission “to reduce the impacts of the key issues residents face, such as the cost of living, health and wellbeing, or gaining skills and employment.”</p>\n<p>The inaugural appearance of “Home Away from Home’s” included dance performances, music, craft workshops with artist Zareena Bano, and more.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>When it comes to knitting complex motifs, a pattern is a needleworker’s best friend. But what if you want to customize one yourself? What about text? Fortunately, Zurich-based designer Rüdiger Schlömer wondered the same thing, resulting in a series of typefaces for knitting. Under the project umbrella of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/05/type-knitting-rudiger-schlomer/\">Typeknitting</a>, his new font is called <a href=\"https://www.knithello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Knit Hello</a>, which works by typing the digital letters into a word processing program like you would with any other font. As you go, a knitting pattern develops at the same time, making it easy to create a beginner-friendly design that you can endlessly customize.</p>\n<p>Download free trial fonts on the Typeknitting <a href=\"https://typeknitting.net/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, or purchase a style that meets the kind of knitting you do, whether on a machine or by hand. And say “hey” to two patterns for full fan scarves, available via Ravelry, on the Knit Hello <a href=\"https://www.knithello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6.jpg\" alt=\"a knitted, patchworked fabric that read \"HELLO\" in different languages\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2.jpg\" alt=\"a composite image of a knitted fabric that reads \"HI\" next to type that reads \"KNIT\" and \"TYPE\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-640x452.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-960x679.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-2-1536x1086.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4.jpg\" alt=\"digital typeface examples that read \"HEY,\" \"HOLA,\" \"CIAO,\" \"HI\" and \"SALUT,\" which double as knitting patterns\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-640x454.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-960x681.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-768x545.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-4-1536x1090.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1.jpg\" alt=\"a small knitted fabric piece that reads \"HELLO\" in red and white yarn, with knitting needles and yarn around it\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-640x452.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-960x679.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-1-1536x1086.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3.jpg\" alt=\"an image of a knitted alphabet in blue-and-white yarn next to a digital typeface that doubles as a knitting pattern\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-640x454.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-960x681.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-768x545.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-3-1536x1090.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7.jpg\" alt=\"a knitted red-and-white scarf with the word \"HELLO\" in numerous languages\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-640x445.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-960x668.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-768x534.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/knithello-7-1536x1068.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\t</div>\n\t</article>\n\t</section>",

Crouching down to reach her, the military fatigue-clad Volodimir stands on a train headed for the city of Kramatorsk in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. He’s on his way to the battlefield to fight Russia’s invasion.</p>\n<p>Taken by Ilvy Nijokiktijen, the photo capturing this heartwrenching moment is one of nearly 200 included in a book and large-scale exhibition at <a href=\"https://www.fenix.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Fenix,</a> a new art museum in Rotterdam that focuses entirely on migration. <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/96/9789464941562\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Family of Migrants</em></a> takes a broad look at human movement from 1905 to the present day, citing a wide array of reasons someone might relocate from war and economic crises to exile and internment to a search for opportunities abroad.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5.jpg\" alt=\"a photo by Ilvy Nijokiktijen of a young woman crying while she holds the hand of a soldier on a train\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/migrants-5-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Ilvy Nijokiktijen, Ukraine, 2022.

Providing such an expansive perspective of movement connects myriad experiences—from a Ukrainian soldier off to war to a young Afghan refugee to a poverty-stricken mother and her children—and is an attempt to broaden how we think of migration.</p>\n<p>“In every era, there has been movement of people, be it out of free will, out of necessity, or under pressure. Migration shapes the world, separating and connecting people, but when we talk about migration, the focus all too quickly shifts to figures or politics,” curator Hanneke Mantel says.</p>\n<p>The title references the 1955 Museum of Modern Art exhibition, <em>The Family of Man</em>. Curated by Edward Steichen, the bold exhibition included hundreds of photos that presented a narrative of global solidarity after World War II. Steichan wanted to depict “the gamut of life from birth to death,” a task Mantel seems to take on at Fenix by sharing a fuller story of migration today.</p>\n<p><em>The Family of Migrants</em>, published by <a href=\"https://hannibalbooks.be/en/soon\" target=\"_blank\">Hannibal Books</a>, includes photos by icons like Dorothea Lange and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/01/ernest-cole-the-true-america/\">Ernest Cole</a>, along with those working today like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2024/04/world-press-photos-2024/\">Alejandro Cegarra</a>.

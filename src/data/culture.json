    "body": "\n\tin Psychology |   \tNovember 17th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn the two-thou­sands, the magi­cian-come­di­ans Penn and Teller host­ed a tele­vi­sion series called Bull­shit! In it, they took on a vari­ety of cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­na they regard­ed as wor­thy of the tit­u­lar epi­thet, from ESP to Area 51, exor­cism to cre­ation­ism, feng shui to haute cui­sine. Their sar­don­ic argu­ments were enriched by clips of assort­ed inter­vie­wees —speak­ing in defense of the top­ic of the day. Penn once addressed the view­ers, say­ing that we might won­der why any­one agrees to come on the show, giv­en how they must know it will make them come off. But every­one, he explained, con­fi­dent­ly believes that their own ideas are the cor­rect ones.\nThat episode came right to mind while watch­ing the new Ver­i­ta­si­um video above, which deals with the phe­nom­e­non of over­con­fi­dence. Like the oft-cit­ed 93 per­cent of Amer­i­cans who believe them­selves bet­ter dri­vers than the medi­an, we all fall vic­tim to that afflic­tion at one time or anoth­er, to one degree or anoth­er; the more inter­est­ing mat­ter under inves­ti­ga­tion is why that should be so.\nOne can always point to what T. S. Eliot called “the end­less strug­gle to think well of them­selves”: want­i­ng to believe that we know it all, we take pains to present our­selves as if we do. But as explained by the pro­fes­sors inter­viewed here, Carnegie Mel­lon’s Baruch Fis­chhoff and Berke­ley’s Don A. Moore (author of Per­fect­ly Con­fi­dent: How to Cal­i­brate Your Deci­sions Wise­ly), the research has also revealed oth­er poten­tial fac­tors in play.\nOne impor­tant can­di­date is, as ever, stu­pid­i­ty. Much has been made of the Dun­ning-Kruger effect, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, which holds that the less com­pe­tent peo­ple are at a task, the more con­fi­dent they tend to be about their abil­i­ty to per­form it. That would seem to accord with much of our every­day expe­ri­ence, but we should also con­sid­er the role played by the basic cog­ni­tive lim­i­ta­tions that apply to us all. Our brains can only process so much at once, and when they come up against capac­i­ty, they default to sim­pli­fied, and often too-sim­pli­fied, ver­sions of the prob­lem before them. It all becomes more dif­fi­cult if we’re insu­lat­ed from direct, objec­tive feed­back, a con­di­tion that often results from the kind of suc­cess and esteem that can be achieved by pro­ject­ing — you guessed it — con­fi­dence.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhy Incom­pe­tent Peo­ple Think They’re Com­pe­tent: The Dun­ning-Kruger Effect, Explained\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tNovember 17th, 2025  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPunk rock and heavy met­al were two gen­res that evolved over the ‘70s, but seemed to run par­al­lel to each oth­er, despite shar­ing com­mon fash­ion, sounds, and atti­tudes. But then there are moments in his­to­ry, where every­body plays togeth­er in the same sand­box. For exam­ple, the above remas­tered audio, which cap­tures the Aus­tralian band AC/DC on their first Amer­i­can tour, play­ing New York’s CBGB, syn­ony­mous now with punk and new wave music.\nThe date is August 24, 1977, and AC/DC were on a cross-coun­try trip that had tak­en in both club dates and are­nas, where they supported—yes, hard to believe, I know—REO Speed­wag­on. Their album Let There Be Rock had just dropped in June. The band would be in the States until the win­ter.\nThis CBGB gig finds them on the same bill as Talk­ing Heads and the Dead Boys, accord­ing to a poster from the time. And while there’s no video for this show, you can find a few pho­tos that doc­u­ment the con­cert here. You can feel the mug­gy New York sum­mer in these pho­tos, but also the excite­ment of an unfor­get­table gig.\nAt 15 min­utes, the set is short, but still three min­utes longer than the Ramones’ first set at the same club three years ear­li­er. That’s pret­ty met­al, man.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nNYC’s Icon­ic Punk Club CBG­Bs Comes Alive in a Bril­liant Short Ani­ma­tion, Using David Godlis’ Pho­tos of Pat­ti Smith, The Ramones & More\nCBGB’s Hey­day: Watch The Ramones, The Dead Boys, Bad Brains, Talk­ing Heads & Blondie Per­form Live (1974–1982)\nLis­ten to Pat­ti Smith’s Glo­ri­ous Three Hour Farewell to CBGB’s on Its Final Night\nThe Talk­ing Heads Play CBGB, the New York Club That Shaped Their Sound (1975)\nWatch an Episode of TV-CBGB, the First Rock ‘n’ Roll Sit­com Ever Aired on Cable TV (1981)\n Ted Mills is a free­lance writer on the arts.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPeo­ple suf­fer­ing from demen­tia lose their abil­i­ty to take an active part in con­ver­sa­tions, every­day activ­i­ties, and their own phys­i­cal upkeep.\nThey are prone to sud­den mood swings, irri­tabil­i­ty, depres­sion, and anx­i­ety.\nThey may be strick­en with delu­sions and wild hal­lu­ci­na­tions.\nAll of these things can be under­stand­ably upset­ting to friends and fam­i­lies. There’s a lot of stig­ma sur­round­ing this sit­u­a­tion.\nTak­ing care of a spouse or par­ent with demen­tia can be an over­whelm­ing­ly iso­lat­ing expe­ri­ence, though no one is more iso­lat­ed than the per­son expe­ri­enc­ing severe cog­ni­tive decline first­hand.\nWhile many of us would do any­thing to stay out of them, the sad fact is res­i­den­tial mem­o­ry care facil­i­ties are often the end-of-the-line real­i­ty for those liv­ing with extreme demen­tia.\nThe Hogeweyk, a planned vil­lage just out­side of Ams­ter­dam, offers a dif­fer­ent sort of future for those with severe demen­tia.\nThe above episode of By Design, Vox’s series about the inter­sec­tion of design and tech­nol­o­gy, explores the inno­va­tions that con­tribute to the Hogeweyk’s res­i­dents’ over­all hap­pi­ness and well­be­ing.\nRather than group­ing res­i­dents togeth­er in a sin­gle insti­tu­tion­al set­ting, they are placed in groups of six, with every­one inhab­it­ing a pri­vate room and shar­ing com­mon spaces as they see fit.\nThe com­mon spaces open onto out­door areas that can be freely enjoyed by all housed in that “neigh­bor­hood”. No need to wait until a staff mem­ber grants per­mis­sion or fin­ish­es some task.\nThose wish­ing to ven­ture fur­ther afield can avail them­selves of such pleas­ant quo­tid­i­an des­ti­na­tions as a gro­cery, a restau­rant, a bar­ber­shop, or a the­ater.\nThese loca­tions are designed in accor­dance with cer­tain things proven to work well in insti­tu­tion­al set­tings —  for instance, avoid­ing dark floor tiles, which some peo­ple with demen­tia per­ceive as holes.\nBut oth­er design ele­ments reflect the choice to err on the side of qual­i­ty of life. Hand rails may help in pre­vent­ing falls, but so do rol­la­tors and walk­ers, which the res­i­dents use on their jaunts to the town squares, gar­dens and pub­lic ameni­ties.\nThe design­ers believe that equip­ping res­i­dents with a high lev­el of free­dom not only pro­motes phys­i­cal activ­i­ty, it min­i­mizes issues asso­ci­at­ed with demen­tia like aggres­sion, con­fu­sion, and wan­der­ing.\nCo-founders Eloy van Hal and Jan­nette Spier­ing write that the Hogeweyk’s crit­ics com­pare it to the Tru­man Show, the 1998 film in which Jim Car­rey’s title char­ac­ter real­izes that his whole­some small town life, and his every inter­ac­tion with his pur­port­ed friends, neigh­bors, and loved ones, have been a set up for a high­ly rat­ed, hid­den cam­era real­i­ty TV show.\nThey describe The Hogeweyk as a stage for, “the rem­i­nis­cence world”, in which actors help the res­i­dents live in a fic­ti­tious world. Many Alzheimer’s experts have, how­ev­er, val­ued The Hogeweyk for what it real­ly is: a famil­iar and safe envi­ron­ment in which peo­ple with demen­tia live while retain­ing their own iden­ti­ty and auton­o­my as much as pos­si­ble. They live in a social com­mu­ni­ty with real streets and squares, a real restau­rant with real cus­tomers, a super­mar­ket for gro­ceries and a the­atre that hosts real per­for­mances. There is no fake bus stop or post office, there are no fake façades and sets. The restau­rant employ­ee, the handy­man, the care­tak­er, the nurse, the hair­dress­er, etc.—in short: every­one who works at The Hogeweyk uses their pro­fes­sion­al skills to actu­al­ly sup­port the res­i­dents and are, there­fore, cer­tain­ly not actors.\nPro­fes­sion­al care and sup­port goes on around the clock, but rarely takes cen­ter­stage. Nor­mal life is pri­or­i­tized.\nA vis­i­tor describes a stroll through some of the Hogeweyk’s pub­lic areas:\n\nIn the shade of one of the large trees, a mar­ried cou­ple gazes hap­pi­ly at the activ­i­ty in the the­atre square. An elder­ly gen­tle­man, togeth­er with a young lady, intent­ly study the large chess board and take turns mov­ing the pieces. At the foun­tain, a group of women chat loud­ly on colour­ful gar­den chairs. The sto­ry is clear­ly audible—it is about a mem­o­ry of a vis­it to a park in Paris which had the same chairs. Passers-by, old and young, greet the women enthu­si­as­ti­cal­ly. A lit­tle fur­ther on, a woman is talk­ing to a man oppo­site her. She is ges­tur­ing wild­ly. After a while, anoth­er woman joins the con­ver­sa­tion. The two women then walk through the open front door of Boule­vard 15. \nThe cov­ered pas­sage smells of fresh­ly-baked cook­ies. The scent is com­ing from De Bonte Hof. Amus­ing con­ver­sa­tions can be heard that pause for a moment when the oven beeps in the kitchen that has been dec­o­rat­ed in an old-fash­ioned style. A tray of fresh cook­ies is removed from the oven. Two women, one in a wheel­chair, enter the venue, obvi­ous­ly seduced by the smell. They sam­ple the cook­ies. \nThe super­mar­ket across the street is very busy. Shop­ping trol­leys loaded with gro­ceries are pushed out of the shop. The rat­tle of a shop­ping trol­ley dis­si­pates into the dis­tance as it dis­ap­pears from view towards Grote Plein. A man reluc­tant­ly push­es the full trol­ley while two women fol­low behind him arm in arm. The trio dis­ap­pear behind the front door of Grote Plein 5.\n\nA staffer’s account of a typ­i­cal morn­ing in one of Hogeweyk’s hous­es reveals more about the hands-on care that allows res­i­dents to con­tin­ue enjoy­ing their care­ful­ly designed home, and the autonomous lifestyle it makes pos­si­ble:\nMr Hen­dricks wakes up on the sofa. He unzips his fly. I jump up and escort him to the toi­let just in time. I grab a roll of med­ica­tion for him from the med­ica­tion trol­ley. He is now walk­ing to his room. We pick out clothes togeth­er and I lay them out on his bed. He wash­es him­self at the sink. I watch briefly before leav­ing. Fif­teen min­utes lat­er, I poke my head through the door. That’s not how elec­tric shav­ing works! I offer to help, but Mr. Hen­dricks is clear­ly a bit irri­tat­ed and grum­bles. He’ll be a lit­tle less shaven today. We’ll try again after break­fast…\nWe help Mrs Sti­j­nen into the show­er chair with the hoist. She is clear­ly not used to it. Dis­cussing her exten­sive Swarovs­ki col­lec­tion, dis­played in the glass case in her room, turns out to be an excel­lent dis­trac­tion. She proud­ly talks about the lat­est piece she acquired this year. On to the show­er. The two oth­er res­i­dents are still sleep­ing. Great, that gives me the chance to devote some extra time to Mrs Sti­j­nen today. \nThe door­bell rings again and my col­league, Yas­min, walks in. She’s the famil­iar face that every­one can rely on. Always present at 8 a.m., 5 days a week. What a relief for res­i­dents and fam­i­ly. She, too, puts her coat and bag in the lock­er. The wash­ing machine is ready, and Yas­min loads up the dry­er. The table in the din­ing room is then set. Yas­min puts a flo­ral table­cloth from the cup­board on the table. Mr Hen­dricks lends a hand and, with some guid­ance, puts two plates in their place, but then walks away to the sofa and sits down. A Dutch break­fast with bread, cheese, cold cuts, jam, cof­fee, tea and milk is served. Yas­min is mak­ing por­ridge for Mrs Smit. As always, she has break­fast in bed. Yas­min helps Mrs Smit. It is now 08:45 and Mr Hen­dricks and Mrs Sti­j­nen are sit­ting at the din­ing table. Yas­min push­es the chairs in and sits down her­self. They chat about the weath­er, and Yas­min lends a help­ing hand when need­ed. \nMr Hen­dricks is real­ly grumpy today and is cur­rent­ly grum­bling at Mrs Jansen. I’m won­der­ing if we’re over­look­ing some­thing?\n\n\n\t\n\nLearn more about the Hogeweyk, the world’s first demen­tia vil­lage here.\nWatch a playlist of Vox By Design episodes here.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nThe Restau­rant of Mis­tak­en Orders: A Tokyo Restau­rant Where All the Servers Are Peo­ple Liv­ing with Demen­tia\nHow Music Can Awak­en Patients with Alzheimer’s and Demen­tia\nDemen­tia Patients Find Some Eter­nal Youth in the Sounds of AC/DC\n- Ayun Hal­l­i­day is the Chief Pri­ma­tol­o­gist in NYC.\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History, Museums |   \tNovember 18th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhether or not we believe that the cards of the tarot have super­nat­ur­al pow­ers, we all think of them pri­mar­i­ly as tools for div­ina­tion. It might seem as if they’ve played that cul­tur­al role since time immemo­r­i­al, but in fact, that par­tic­u­lar use only goes back to the eigh­teenth cen­tu­ry. They were, at first, play­ing cards, used for a game known as taroc­chi in Renais­sance Italy. That was the orig­i­nal pur­pose of the old­est tarot cards in pos­ses­sion of the Vic­to­ria and Albert Muse­um, which you can see unboxed by cura­tor Ruth Hib­bard in the video above. Through­out its fif­teen min­utes, Hib­bard and two col­leagues also “unbox” five oth­er decks pro­duced across the half-mil­len­ni­um of tarot his­to­ry.\nThese include the ear­ly eigh­teenth-cen­tu­ry Minchi­ate Deck, whose name refers to a slight­ly more com­plex Flo­ren­tine card game that evolved along­side tarot. The word itself pos­si­bly orig­i­nates from the term sminchiare, “to play your high­est card” (though in Sicil­ian dialect today, it has a rather dif­fer­ent mean­ing).\nLat­er, cir­ca 1807, comes Le Petit Ora­cle des Dames, “the petite ora­cle of women,” the ear­li­est deck in the video express­ly pro­duced for car­toman­cy, or pre­dic­tion of the future through cards — albeit only as a form of light enter­tain­ment for gath­er­ings of ladies. A decade or two lat­er, out came the lux­u­ri­ous Taroc­co Soprafi­no, which bears lav­ish illus­tra­tions made with cop­per-plate engrav­ing and col­ored sten­cil­ing.\nThe V&A also has an ear­ly twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry tarot deck with rich, live­ly art cre­at­ed by the occultist Pamela Col­man-Smith, whose work has pre­vi­ous­ly been fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture. “What makes these cards so great is that they’re just so rich with mythol­o­gy and sym­bol­o­gy and mul­ti­lay­ered mean­ing,” says cura­tor Beck­ie Billing­ham, “allow­ing you to read the cards in many dif­fer­ent ways.” That’s even true of the much more the­mat­i­cal­ly delib­er­ate deck that fol­lows, an exam­ple from the ear­ly two-thou­sands that brings into our dig­i­tal cen­tu­ry the mis­sion of tarot art to “reveal clan­des­tine knowl­edge and the hid­den pow­ers at work in the world.” Com­put­ers, drones, Aldous Hux­ley, world wars, the World Wide Web: per­haps these cards let us see our future, but they cer­tain­ly give us a clear view on our present.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nMeet the For­got­ten Female Artist Behind the World’s Most Pop­u­lar Tarot Deck (1909)\nBehold the Sola-Bus­ca Tarot Deck, the Ear­li­est Com­plete Set of Tarot Cards (1490)\nCarl Jung on the Pow­er of Tarot Cards: They Pro­vide Door­ways to the Uncon­scious & Per­haps a Way to Pre­dict the Future\nSal­vador Dalí’s Tarot Cards Get Re-Issued: The Occult Meets Sur­re­al­ism in a Clas­sic Tarot Card Deck\nAle­jan­dro Jodor­owsky Explains How Tarot Cards Can Give You Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\nDivine Decks: A Visu­al His­to­ry of Tarot: The First Com­pre­hen­sive Sur­vey of Tarot Gets Pub­lished by Taschen\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Photo: Olympia Shannon)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nUman’s practice is interdisciplinary and ever-evolving. Comprising painting, drawing, murals, mosaic, sculpture, and glass, her work is rooted in the tangibility of color and the transportive power of images. Shaped by memories, dreams, and the constant flux of life around her, Uman’s visual language is intuitive and multilayered, adaptable and free; it is neither exclusively abstract nor metaphorical — it grows out of what is indeterminate and into the transcendent. Her many inspirations range broadly, from her childhood in East Africa and diasporic experiences in Europe and the US to a love for textiles and transcontinental fashion. Her subject matter evokes the flamboyant fabrics worn by women in Somali bazaars, the slanted flourishes of Arabic calligraphy taught in madrasas, and the vast countryside of Kenya and Upstate New York.\nOn view at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, through May 10, 2026, Uman: After all the things … includes new and recent paintings, works on paper, video, and a sculpture. Created with oil, acrylic, spray paint, oil stick, and even sometimes incorporating elements of collage and sewing as well, Uman’s compositions dance with animated hues and phantasmagoric patterns. Working on many pieces simultaneously, Uman builds her pictorial arrangements — many of which reference 19th-century French painting, surrealism, and visionary abstraction alongside the natural world — with energetic mark-making methods, using dry brushes and even her fingers and palms, resulting in surface treatments that disrupt the conventional distinction between paintings and drawing. Fusing art history with autobiography and spirituality with reality, Uman’s work pursues the metaphorical through a close attention to, and reverence for, the natural world.\nUman: After all the things … is accompanied by the artist’s first museum publication, co-published by Gregory R. Miller & Co., featuring an essay by the curator, images of the work on view, and installation images.\nFor more information, visit thealdrich.org.\nUman: After all the things … is organized by Amy Smith-Stewart, Diana Bowes Chief Curator.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStriking union members on the picket line at the staff entrance of the Tate Modern on August 18, 2020 (photo by Guy Smallman/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nMonths after the Tate Museums in England cut 7% of their workforce, citing a post-pandemic slump, workers have vowed to go on strike for a week starting November 26.\nMore than 150 workers at Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool, and Tate St. Ives plan to strike over wages, citing “below-inflationary” pay raise offers over the last two years, a union spokesperson told Hyperallergic. \nThe striking staff members belong to Tate Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS Tate United), one of the three unions representing museum employees. In a ballot held on November 11, 98% of union staff members voted in favor of striking. The move comes after the museum cut a reported 40 jobs in March, attributing the downsizing to pandemic-related deficits. The strike is expected to end on December 2.\nThe union said in a press release that based on a recent survey, 72.2% of its members could not afford basic living costs with their salaries. The BBC reported this week that prices rose by 3.8% in the United Kingdom in 2025.\nA union spokesperson rebuked the museum’s 2% pay raise offer for 2024, which was later increased to 3% for 2025–2026. According to PCS Tate United, the pay raise offer “does not address ongoing issues of low pay at the institution.”\nThe union also said in a press release that the job cuts earlier this year led to the closure of a subsidized dining hall for staff.\n“The dispute is primarily focused on pay, with the last two years seeing below-inflationary offers,” a union spokesperson told Hyperallergic in an email. “This is in addition to a sustained period of cutbacks and restructures, with a series of voluntary redundancies, the closure of the subsidised staff canteen and the redundancies of some of the canteen staff.”\nIn response to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment, a Tate spokesperson said directors at the museum were not offered salary increases this year as part of institutional attempts to maintain a “balanced budget,” and added that the offer of a 3% pay increase was accepted by Tate’s other two unions.\n“Tate has made careful savings this year in order to invest in staff pay and still achieve a balanced budget,” the spokesperson said. “It is only by creating and maintaining a sustainable financial model that we can continue to invest in our staff in the long term.”\nWorkers previously went on strike in 2020, when the museum announced it intended to cut 313 jobs, or about half of its workforce.\n“With many Tate directors receiving six-figure pay packages and five-figure bonuses while staff are condemned to in-work poverty, it is no wonder we have seen such an overwhelming vote for strike action,” PCS General Secretary Fran Heathcote said in a statement. “Our members have rightly rejected another insulting pay offer from senior Tate management, and now stand ready to take strike action that will severely impact gallery operations.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

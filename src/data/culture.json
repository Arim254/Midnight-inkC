    "body": "\n\tin Life, Music |   \tJanuary 12th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n?si=euaFB6jMJ_TPxRmf\nDown in Austin, Texas, music teacher Gavin Tabone leads the Bar­ton Hills Choir, made up of 3rd- through 6th-grade stu­dents. Backed by pro­fes­sion­al musi­cians, the choir per­forms a wide-rang­ing mix of music, from clas­sic pop and rock to indie songs by artists like Wilco, Muse, The Flam­ing Lips, and espe­cial­ly the Grate­ful Dead. Above and below, you can find per­for­mances of such Dead clas­sics as “Rip­ple,” “Box of Rain” and “Going Down the Road Feel­ing Bad” → “I Know You Rid­er.” And if you head to their YouTube chan­nel, you can find ver­sions of “Cas­sidy,” “Touch of Grey,” “Scar­let Bego­nias,” “Broke­down Palace,” and more.\n\n\n\t\n\nWith the pass­ing of Bob Weir this week­end, it seems like a fit­ting time to high­light these per­for­mances. Weir first joined the Dead when only a teenag­er, still basi­cal­ly a kid him­self, and then con­tin­ued the jour­ney for the next 60 years, intro­duc­ing the Dead­’s song­book to suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions of fans. In recent years, he talked about the Dead song­book endur­ing for the next 200 to 300 years, much as Beethoven remains with us today. As we watch ele­men­tary stu­dents per­form Grate­ful Dead clas­sics, it’s hard not to think that Weir was on to some­thing.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nEle­men­tary School Kids Sing David Bowie’s “Space Odd­i­ty” & Oth­er Rock Hits: A Cult Clas­sic Record­ed in 1976\nThe Grate­ful Dead’s “Rip­ple” Played By Musi­cians Around the World (with Cameos by David Cros­by, Jim­my Buf­fett & Bill Kreutz­mann)\nWhen the Grate­ful Dead Played at the Egypt­ian Pyra­mids, in the Shad­ow of the Sphinx (1978)\nThe Iso­lat­ed Bass Grooves of The Grate­ful Dead’s Phil Lesh (RIP)\nStream a Mas­sive Archive of Grate­ful Dead Con­certs from 1965–1995\nHow the Grate­ful Dead’s “Wall of Sound”–a Mon­ster, 600-Speak­er Sound System–Changed Rock Con­certs & Live Music For­ev­er\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tJanuary 12th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe term sur­re­al­ism — or rather, sur­réal­isme — orig­i­nates from the French words for “beyond real­i­ty.” That’s a zone, we may assume, reach­able by only dar­ing, and pos­si­bly unhinged, artis­tic minds. But in fact, even the most down-to-earth among us go beyond real­i­ty on a night­ly basis. We do so in our dreams, where the accept­ed mechan­ics of space and time, life and death, and cause and effect do not apply. Or rather, they’re replaced by anoth­er set of rules entire­ly, which feels per­fect­ly con­sis­tent and con­vinc­ing to us in the moment. Such “dream log­ic” may frus­trate the friends and fam­i­ly we attempt to regale with tales of our night visions, but as the sur­re­al­ists found, it could also be put to the ser­vice of endur­ing art.\nIn the Hochela­ga video above, that chan­nel’s cre­ator Tom­mie Trelawny pro­vides a long his­to­ry of sur­re­al­ism in a short run­ning time. Trac­ing that move­men­t’s roots, he goes all the way back to the ancient cul­ture of the Aus­tralian Abo­rig­i­nals, for whom the con­cept of the “dream­time” still plays an impor­tant role — and has inspired “pos­si­bly the old­est unbro­ken artis­tic tra­di­tion in the world.”\nIn oth­er places and oth­er eras of antiq­ui­ty, dreams were also con­sid­ered “a bridge for the spir­it world and the phys­i­cal one.” For the Egyp­tians, “these night­time voy­ages were a chance to see real­i­ty more clear­ly,” as evi­denced by resut, their word for “dream,” which also means “awak­en­ing.” Unsur­pris­ing­ly for reg­u­lar Hochela­ga view­ers, Trelawny also finds dreams in the Bible, “a book full of visions of the divine and glimpses into the cos­mic unknown.”\nIn every peri­od between antiq­ui­ty and now, art — includ­ing the work of Hierony­mus Bosch, Albrecht Dur­er, and Edvard Munch, as well as Japan­ese wood­block prints — has attempt­ed to cap­ture the sort of expe­ri­ences and imagery encoun­tered only in dreams, and indeed night­mares. But it was only in the wake of Sig­mund Freud’s The Inter­pre­ta­tion of Dreams, first pub­lished in 1899, that sur­re­al­ism could take shape, inspired by the ques­tion, “If the mind can reveal itself through dreams, what if it could reveal itself through art?” Après Freud came the uncon­scious­ness-inspired paint­ings of Gior­gio de Chiri­co, René Magritte, and of course Sal­vador Dalí. Yet none of them could have fore­seen the tru­ly sur­re­al­is­tic déluge that arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence has brought us. If AI reveals to us some­thing of how we think, its hal­lu­ci­na­tions reveal to us even more about how we dream.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAn Intro­duc­tion to Sur­re­al­ism: The Big Aes­thet­ic Ideas Pre­sent­ed in Three Videos\nWhat Makes Sal­vador Dalí’s Icon­ic Sur­re­al­ist Paint­ing The Per­sis­tence of Mem­o­ry a Great Work of Art\nWatch Dreams That Mon­ey Can Buy, a Sur­re­al­ist Film by Man Ray, Mar­cel Duchamp, Alexan­der Calder, Fer­nand Léger & Hans Richter\nEurope After the Rain: Watch the Vin­tage Doc­u­men­tary on the Two Great Art Move­ments, Dada & Sur­re­al­ism (1978)\nDavid Lynch Presents the His­to­ry of Sur­re­al­ist Film (1987)\nThe Fan­tas­tic Women Of Sur­re­al­ism: An Intro­duc­tion\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor the Chicana feminist theorist Gloria Anzaldúa, rigidity is a sure path to demise. In her manifesto, Borderlands/La Frontera, Anzaldúa presents what she calls a new mestiza consciousness, which advocates for ambiguity and moves “toward a more whole perspective, one that includes rather than excludes.”\nGroundbreaking when it was published in 1987, this theory pushed queer, feminist, and cultural scholars to consider how identity is both fluid and informed by several overlapping factors. It also helped to lay the groundwork for branches of study like ecofeminism, which connects the subjugation of women to the subjugation of nature.\n“Ritual a las faldas de un volcán” (2025), oil on linen, 120 x 90 x 4 centimeters\nMexican artist Hilda Palafox draws on these lines of inquiry in her exhibition De Tierra y Susurros, or Of Soil and Whispers. Comprised of oil paintings on linen and carved cantera reliefs, this body of work considers a spiritual connection between women and nature and the possibilities for attuning ourselves to our environment once again. “For me, the point where two lines meet lies precisely there: in the conscious decision to pause, to listen, and to pay closer attention,” the artist says in a statement.\nOften capturing a moment of respite, several of Palafox’s paintings depict tender acts of care. “Origen,” for example, features two topless figures in the fetal position, cradling a sapling, while “Presagio” is similarly delicate as small yellow butterflies emerge between two women. One of the fluttering insects even lands on a fraying chain-link fence in the foreground, a metaphor for the rigid systems, both internal and external, that Anzaldúa opposed. \nPalafox has long been interested in how our bodies inform our experiences, and earlier works typically played with scale and proportion to explore such connections. In De Tierra y Susurros, the artist extends these metaphors to more directly incorporate ecology through a rich palette of Earth tones and vast landscapes that highlight the relationship between humanity and nature. A series of reliefs titled Portrals further entrenches Palafox’s attraction to the in between, as fragments of figures and flora intertwine to form ambiguous intersections. \nDe Tierra y Susurros is on view through February 21 at Sean Kelly, New York. Keep up with Palafox on Instagram.\n“Presagio” (2025), oil on linen, 180 x 140 x 4 centimeters\n“Custodia” (2025), diptych oil on linen, 220 x 240 x 4 centimeters\n“Portal III” (2025), low relief in Mexican cantera stone, 43.5 x 35 x 4 centimeters\n“Susurros II” (2025), oil on linen, 140 x 130 x 4 centimeters\n“Tierra sombra tostada” (2025), diptych oil and wax on linen, 140 x 440 x 4 centimeters\n“Resiliencia I” (2025), oil on linen,  180 x 160 x 4 centimeters\n“Portal I” (2025), low relief in Mexican cantera stone, 43.5 x 35 x 4 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCarved in low relief on vertical panels of wood, winged creatures, flowers, and mammals populate the surfaces of Valerie Hammond’s dream-like compositions. The artist plumbs the liminal state between sleeping and waking, where reality and fantasy blend and are sometimes indiscernible.\nHammond recently exhibited a new body of work at Planthouse in an exhibition titled Waking Dreams, which is also the name of her series of wood engravings depicting flora and woodland creatures in an elegant, suspended state. Focusing on animals like bats, moths, hares, and owls, the artist brings nocturnal creatures to the fore—those that become active at dusk—in an elegant exploration of the relationships between day and night and reality and imagination.\n“Deer Frieze” (2025), ink on paper cut-out mounted on archival board, 29 x 25 inches \nWaking dreams, in particular, fuel Hammond’s recent pieces. A phenomenon in which one is not quite fully asleep but not entirely awake either—sometimes referred to as a hypnagogic state—in which vivid, dream-like experiences blur the distinction between the real and the imagined. Through her drawings and carvings, “Hammond captures the fleeting visual language of the subconscious, balancing control and surrender as conscious details interact with the spontaneous flow of ink,” says a statement.\nExplore more of Hammond’s work and follow updates on the artist’s Instagram. You might also enjoy similar themes of nature and consciousness in the work of Kiki Smith.\nInstallation view of ‘Waking Dreams’ at Planthouse\n“Waking Dreams 3 (Owl Moth)” (2025), wood engraving, 48 x 25 inches\nDetail of “Waking Dreams 3 (Owl Moth)” (2025), wood engraving, 48 x 25 inches\n“Midnight Hours (Fox)” (2025), ink on Japanese paper, 25 1/4 x 27 1/2 inches\nInstallation view of ‘Waking Dreams’ at Planthouse\n“Waking Dreams I (Bat)” (2025), wood engraving, 48 x 24 inches\n“Midnight Hours (Wolves)” (2025), ink on Japanese paper, 69 1/2 x 38 inches \n“Waking Dreams 2 (Hare)” (2025), wood engraving, 48 x 25 inches\nInstallation view of ‘Waking Dreams’ at Planthouse\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Large New England Landscapes (Selected Paintings 2008-2025), on view at 425 Market Street, focuses on New England, where Johnson has been making regular painting trips since 2005. The paintings mostly reference Cape Porpoise, Maine; and Cape Cod. At 555 California Street, Giant Abstract and Landscape Works (Selected Paintings 2012-2025) features 11 78 x 120 inch canvases, including the brand new “Race Point Bench” (2026) inspired by Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi, as well as “Tokyo” (2012-2014), made after several trips to Japan. The 555 California show will also feature two San Francisco cityscapes, which include the building itself.Joan Ludman, the author of Fairfield Porter: A Catalogue Raisonne of His Paintings, Watercolors, and Pastels, wrote about Johnson’s work in the 2014 monograph, Color as Content:“Color, color relationships, pattern and form are the hallmarks of Mitchell Johnson's achievement. Contemplating the growth and movement of his efforts over the years, we experience his intent, instinct and intuition. We become aware of his affinities with Morandi and Albers, and with Bonnard, Vuillard and Fairfield Porter. Johnson has remarked that he tries to \"combine Morandi's feeling for composition with Albers'  intelligence about color.\" And he exhibits an inspirational and perhaps emotional relationship with the work of Fairfield Porter.”Mitchell Johnson, “Tokyo” (2014-2018), oil on canvas, 78x120 inches More recently, in a 2021 article for Artscope Magazine, Lee Roscoe wrote:“Indeed, color and shape seem to be the point rather than the subjects themselves. The houses and landscapes Johnson paints are, in a way, excuses to express colors. One wonders, is he suggesting our world is just color and form? And yet those colors and forms evoke the essence of place: his European vistas are somehow, well, so European. His vistas of New York, are utterly New York; those of San Francisco as from Russian Hill, could only be San Francisco. So, too, his Cape Cod vistas essentialize the Cape.”An article on Johnson by Susana Byers, “Seeing Paintings Instead of Locations,” appeared in American Artist Magazine in 1997 and included Johnson’s own explanation of his process:“Every element in a painting must work in terms of composition and color,”…“My somewhat abstract interpretations of the landscape and people in outdoor scenes are the result of this belief; the painting has to function as a painting. For instance, when I depict a tree against a sky, there has to be both value and color tension between the two elements. I focus on color, texture, and placement as much as image. If one of these aspects, even in a single tree, doesn’t work, I’ll scrape off the paint and start over again-just as quickly as if the entire view had failed to come together.”Mitchell Johnson’s paintings are in 700 private collections and the permanent collections of 40 museums. His work has been the subject of two museum retrospectives. An exhibition of his small paintings will be on view in Paris at Galerie Mercier this March.For more information, visit mitchelljohnson.com and follow him on Instagram: @mitchell_johnson_artist.Request a digital catalog by emailing mitchell.catalog@gmail.com.Mitchell Johnson, “Cape Porpoise” (2014), oil on canvas, 78x120 inches \n                  \n                      \n                        Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Sponsored\n                      \n                      \n                        Exhibition Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        San Francisco\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

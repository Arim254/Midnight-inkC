    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStriking union members on the picket line at the staff entrance of the Tate Modern on August 18, 2020 (photo by Guy Smallman/Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nMonths after the Tate Museums in England cut 7% of their workforce, citing a post-pandemic slump, workers have vowed to go on strike for a week starting November 26.\nMore than 150 workers at Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool, and Tate St. Ives plan to strike over wages, citing “below-inflationary” pay raise offers over the last two years, a union spokesperson told Hyperallergic. \nThe striking staff members belong to Tate Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS Tate United), one of the three unions representing museum employees. In a ballot held on November 11, 98% of union staff members voted in favor of striking. The move comes after the museum cut a reported 40 jobs in March, attributing the downsizing to pandemic-related deficits. The strike is expected to end on December 2.\nThe union said in a press release that based on a recent survey, 72.2% of its members could not afford basic living costs with their salaries. The BBC reported this week that prices rose by 3.8% in the United Kingdom in 2025.\nA union spokesperson rebuked the museum’s 2% pay raise offer for 2024, which was later increased to 3% for 2025–2026. According to PCS Tate United, the pay raise offer “does not address ongoing issues of low pay at the institution.”\nThe union also said in a press release that the job cuts earlier this year led to the closure of a subsidized dining hall for staff.\n“The dispute is primarily focused on pay, with the last two years seeing below-inflationary offers,” a union spokesperson told Hyperallergic in an email. “This is in addition to a sustained period of cutbacks and restructures, with a series of voluntary redundancies, the closure of the subsidised staff canteen and the redundancies of some of the canteen staff.”\nIn response to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment, a Tate spokesperson said directors at the museum were not offered salary increases this year as part of institutional attempts to maintain a “balanced budget,” and added that the offer of a 3% pay increase was accepted by Tate’s other two unions.\n“Tate has made careful savings this year in order to invest in staff pay and still achieve a balanced budget,” the spokesperson said. “It is only by creating and maintaining a sustainable financial model that we can continue to invest in our staff in the long term.”\nWorkers previously went on strike in 2020, when the museum announced it intended to cut 313 jobs, or about half of its workforce.\n“With many Tate directors receiving six-figure pay packages and five-figure bonuses while staff are condemned to in-work poverty, it is no wonder we have seen such an overwhelming vote for strike action,” PCS General Secretary Fran Heathcote said in a statement. “Our members have rightly rejected another insulting pay offer from senior Tate management, and now stand ready to take strike action that will severely impact gallery operations.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

NYC)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nAs the autumn chill pushes our events back indoors for the next seven months, it’s critical that we do everything in our power to keep gatherings accessible to everyone — especially our community members with chronic illnesses, disabilities, and other conditions that require taking stringent COVID-19 safety precautions to protect their lives. One Brooklyn-based collective, Artists in Resistance (A.I.R.) NYC, is committed to not only hosting COVID-safer art and music events from borough to borough, but also ensuring that anybody can do so for free.\nA.I.R. maintains a “library” of eight high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters (also known as air purifiers) that can be rented with a refundable $20 deposit for various events — though many renters opt to donate their deposit to help the collective cover rent and need-based transport costs. The collective’s volunteers manage its rental requests schedule and facilitate (masked) pick-ups and drop-offs during standard business hours seven days a week.\nWhen an air purifier is in use, indoor air is mechanically pulled through a filter comprised of a dense, pleated fiber mat that can capture minuscule particulate matter, from mold and dust to particles carrying bacteria and viruses. They’ve been proven to reduce the airborne transmission of COVID when used correctly. \n“Illness need not be the price of living in community or participating in the arts,” said Sarina Dass and Michelle Borreggine, advocacy volunteers with A.I.R., citing one of the collective’s four main tenets in an interview with Hyperallergic. \n\nBorreggine told Hyperallergic that when she developed health issues after contracting COVID, she felt isolated while continuing to take precautions when her social group had moved on. She sought out a space where other people also prioritized COVID safety, leading her to A.I.R. Dass said they joined after attending multiple events that rented air purifiers from the collective.\nBoth stressed that the A.I.R.’s primary causes are health and disability justice and harm reduction, both of which are essential for artists and culture workers who are disenfranchised and under-served, but are vital to the city’s infrastructure and economy. Safer receptions, artist talks, performances, concerts, and workshops should be accessible for everybody, they said.\nCrediting the Chicago-based Clean Air Club for their comprehensive guide on how to develop an air purifier library, Borreggine said that A.I.R. was born in early 2024 and has served over 100 local events this year alone, ranging from concerts by touring musicians and special community workshops to private parties and fundraisers. While most renters are inherently COVID-conscious, she mentioned that some individuals seek out A.I.R.’s library for an event because it’s the only mitigation resource available when hosts don’t enforce masking and other precautions.\n\nSinger Beverly Glenn-Copeland took the stage at a mask-required concert at Pioneer Works last September, using all eight of A.I.R.’s available purifiers for maximum safety. (Photo by Walter Wlodarczyk, courtesy of A.I.R. NYC)\nDass and Borreggine mentioned that at its core, A.I.R. is made up of volunteers with different abilities, and operates as an “anti-capitalist, anti-Zionist, anti-imperialist organization that incorporates intersectionality to build a new way of living that will disrupt colonial ideologies of healthcare in America.” They also noted that in observance of the “intersection between health justice and colonial violence,” the collective has committed to the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). \nIf you’re not hosting an event anytime soon and still want to support the collective’s mission, in addition to donations, A.I.R. is looking for more volunteers and outreach support for raising awareness of its library and the importance of COVID safety in a post-quarantine society. Even if you don’t have time to volunteer, you can still advocate for a safer arts and culture scene in NYC by asking event organizers to consider implementing air purifier use and other precautions for improved accessibility. \n“The pandemic is ongoing, and COVID continues to cause illness, disability, and death in our communities. Meanwhile, the public health response has been systematically dismantled,” A.I.R.’s mission reads. “Our government, institutions, and workplaces have failed us, but we can protect each other.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuncan McGillivray-Smith, \"Hunt\" (2023), oil on burlap (all images courtesy Ackerman Clarke, Chicago)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nCHICAGO — I was not familiar with Duncan McGillivray-Smith before I saw his auspicious debut exhibition, Ataraxia, at Ackerman Clarke. “Ataraxia” is an ancient Greek philosophical term for a state of tranquility that is achieved by detaching from external desires and concentrating attention on inner peace. While these paintings project a sense of calm, there is also a feeling of disquiet. The normal and anomalous overlap and become difficult to tell apart. That tension animates these peculiar images, in which figures and shadows, flatness and space, are equally important.\nOf the exhibition’s seven oil paintings, two are relatively small (no more than 18 by 14 inches). In the other five — all between 32 by 42 and 84 by 74 inches — the interplay between the featureless figures and their shadows transforms the oddly elevated views into mysterious narratives arising out of common human activities, such as skiing or felling a tree with a crosscut saw. \nIn “Late Day in a Small World” (2023), McGillivray-Smith depicts a stage-like outdoor space in which the ground takes up most of the picture plane. Along the top edge is a thin pink halation line that represents the horizon. Below, on the blue surface, two men and a woman are standing around a tree that divides the plane vertically; behind it is a black and white cow known as a Holstein Friesian. Above the horizon, visible through a row of narrow white trunks and dense green trees, is a gently sloping mountain spanning the length of the canvas, and a dramatic blue and pink sky. \n\nDuncan McGillivray-Smith, “Late Day in a Small World” (2023), oil on burlap\nThe three people, all apparently dressed in pajamas, are engaged in an animated conversation about something we can only guess at. Large blue shadows extend from these figures and the trees. A featureless man facing us points toward the left edge of the work; below his hand, we can see a snake crawling out from under a boulder.\nAs on a stage, the principal players and key props are largely visible. Yet here we have no idea what’s going on. This resistance to interpretation is what held my attention in the confounding “Four of Us” (2024). Amid a similar stage-like setting with a backdrop of trees, houses, a mountain, and an evening sky, two figures are using a crosscut saw to cut down a thin tree or sapling. While the man on the left is wearing a plaid shirt, brown pants, and pink shoes or socks, the one on the right is a solid red shape surrounded by a blue halation line. Located in the foreground, these two people form the base of a triangle, with a third person further back, creating the apex. \n\nDuncan McGillivray-Smith, “Four of Us” (2024), oil on canvas,\nEach person casts a large shadow that suggests another figure who appears capable of taking on a life of their own. This effect is enhanced by a fourth shadow rising up from the painting’s bottom edge. What is casting the light that makes the blackish-green silhouettes contrast sharply with the green ground speckled with blue, orange, red, and light green daubs? Who is the fourth person? If the tree falls, will it hit anyone? Are the silhouettes premonitions of disaster? \nThis is McGillivray-Smith’s great strength — in his seemingly serene scenes, ominous outcomes lurk as shadows or the uninvited snake. His use of shadows is inventive and uncanny. In “Thaw on the Mountain, Ice in the Valley” (2024), we see three skiers but four shadows on a white ski slope that divides the picture plane diagonally — the fourth, a head and shoulders rising from the bottom right edge, indicates a person outside of the pictorial space. One skier wears a sweater decorated with clouds and a sun rising in a brown sky, and the profile of a black horse on a green hill — a world within a world. \n\nDuncan McGillivray-Smith, “Thaw on the Mountain, Ice in the Valley” (2024), oil on canvas,\nWhile we have seen the silhouette of an unseen person in “Four of Us,” in this work, McGillivray-Smith splits the shadows of the skiers between the snow-covered slope and the valley with mountains in the distance, which fills the rest of the canvas. Two of the figures cast shadows that extend across the snow and onto these mountains. This improbable divide is integral to the logic of the painting and the world it evokes.  \nMcGillivray-Smith’s debut is impressive. Each of the scenes he builds through paint has its own logic and feels hard won. The composition and elements work in tandem to convey an open-ended narrative. Finally, and most importantly, these domains all belong to the artist. \nAtaraxia continues at Ackerman Clarke (2544 West Fullerton Avenue, Chicago, Illinois) through November 22. The exhibition was organized by the gallery.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Yau is an award winning poet, critic, curator, and publisher of Black Square Editions.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne of the most prevalent memes pertaining to the British Museum's collection.(screenshot Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic via X)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nInternational museum heists have populated our newsfeeds in a bizarre, whack-a-mole-eque fashion over the last few weeks, reinvigorating conversations around stolen artifacts and post-colonial remediations, as well as unleashing a relentless deluge of memes that inspired many a Halloween costume. And even while the Musée du Louvre bows its head in shame, taking blow after blow, first in the form of stolen and still-missing jewels and then in the revelation of its painfully insecure security system passwords, the current keeps steering me back to the British Museum. The once and always profiteer of colonial and extractive proclivities just … embraces PR nightmares with open arms, as if it’s above it all.\nIts reputation as a symbol of imperial looting is so cemented that as soon as the robbers absconded with France’s crown jewels, people from all over were telling the British Museum to turn out its pockets. Given the museum’s storied collection of lifted artifacts, the public wonders (mostly in jest) if it’s become emboldened to steal artifacts once again?\n(@livingformlk via X; screenshot Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)\n\nJust to recap: It’s not just the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of stolen objects the museum acquired through centuries of imperial looting, pillaging, and bloodshed across the world that render the British Museum unfavorable to most. It’s that the museum has made essentially no effort to reckon with its harm. It has spent almost 100 years repeatedly declining to repatriate the Parthenon Marbles to Greece, and maintains an ironclad grip over other contested objects in its collection, including an enormous swath of Benin Bronzes, the Rosetta Stone, and Moai from Rapa Nui (Easter Island), among a long list of priceless cultural, archaeological, and spiritual/animated objects. The museum hides behind opaque artspeak and institutional bullshitting, claiming to be “negotiating” and “developing relationships” with those seeking restitution.\nNot so secret, really … (Screenshot Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic via X)\nEven its own halls aren’t immune to thievery. Adding insult to injury, the museum is in the middle of legal proceedings regarding internal thefts within its collection across a decade — thus nullifying any argument that the institution is a safer and more stable environment for these invaluable objects. Who among us can’t feel a twinge of satisfaction at the irony of allegations that ~a thief~ plundered a collection from the Institute of Imperial Loot?\nAnd if you thought it couldn’t get any more egregious, the museum dug itself into an even deeper hole by opting to renew its highly criticized BP sponsorship, even though a majority of British arts and culture institutions have dropped the petrol giant’s funding over the last decade. Shortly after announcing its billion-dollar initiative to eliminate its carbon footprint entirely, at that.\nIf it wasn’t so depressing, I would say that I’m kind of impressed with the museum’s commitment to wickedness and backwardness. But thankfully, everyone else’s humorous, bittersweet takes bring a smile to my face.\nContrary to everything I’ve written in this post, it really can be that simple sometimes. (Screenshot Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic via X)\n\n(Screenshot Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic via X)\nWhat’s clear is that the best coping mechanism we have for our joint exasperation and disgust is trolling the fuck out of the British Museum. We’ve done it right here at Hyperallergic for April Fools’ Day; an artist has outright stolen from the museum as an ironic statement; and it’s been the site of climate protests long before the first can of soup was ever thrown at a van Gogh. And thousands of others who’ve been maligned by the institution’s … er … acquisition practices have visited it specifically to make derisive, sarcastic, and ultimately viral content.\n\n\nBut while these memes are funny and confrontational, their virality and tone can flatten, objectify, and, in some occasions, even discount the phenomena they call attention to, inadvertently normalizing the very crimes that they needle.\nWe’ve seen this happen with the proliferation of “arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor” tagline, which initially took off as a means of raising awareness of the atrocious systems of anti-Blackness, including no-knock warrants and police immunity, that facilitated the state’s murder of the 26-year-old African-American EMT, and holding them and their perpetrators accountable. But they ended up collapsing a brutal reality into comedic social media fodder, if not a commoditized punchline altogether. And they eventually lost steam as the pursuit of justice for Taylor hit roadblocks, and attention drifted elsewhere, suggesting it was never that deeply felt by many. (Aja Romano has also written an in-depth, thought-provoking piece on this for Vox.)\nWhile tackling a completely different problem, Morgan Sung observed in Mashable that the “Epstein didn’t kill himself” theory-turned-meme variations initially tried to remind people not to lose focus on the hidden networks protecting the powerful and perverse. But it soon ended up doing that very thing: diluting and devolving the real issue into a spammed one-liner that lost all meaning as our eyes glazed over from repeated encounters. \n\nWhen taking on systems that continuously subdue, marginalize, and extract from us, distilling their complexities and absurdities into accessible, exaggerated humor and public shaming does help get everyone in on the problem at hand. But it also runs the risk of oversimplifying the insidiousness of these forces and compressing the layers of historic depravity into something easily consumable — often yielding results that don’t differ so much from institutional posturing.\n\n\nAll of that is to say that while these memes and other jabs may not be driving actual repatriations or even impacting attendance (the museum stays flush, funded, and flourishing one way or another), I give them credit for keeping the British Museum in hot water even when it’s not in the headlines. They give voice to the helpless indignation we all feel. And it deserves to be knocked down a few pegs in the court of public opinion from a respected, worldly (lol) educational institution to the big box of deceit, harm, trauma, and thievery that it is.\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

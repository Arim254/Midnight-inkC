    "body": "\n\tin History, Music, Podcasts |   \tDecember 23rd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen dis­cussing a musi­cian like Fela Kuti, many of our usu­al terms fail us. They fail us, that is, if we came of age in a musi­cal cul­ture in which artists and bands put out an album of ten or so lyrics-for­ward songs every two or three years, pro­mot­ing it on tour while also play­ing their biggest hits. Fela — as all his fans refer to him — could put out six or sev­en albums in a sin­gle year, and refused to play live any mate­r­i­al he’d already record­ed. Even the word song, as we know it, does­n’t quite reflect the nature of his com­po­si­tions, which got expan­sive enough that two or three of them (or just one, half of it on each side) could fill a long-play­ing record.\nWal­ter Ben­jamin said of great lit­er­ary works that they either dis­solve a genre or invent one, and Fela’s musi­cal works invent­ed the genre of Afrobeat. The sound of that genre, as explained by Noah Lefevre in the Poly­phon­ic video above, reflects the dis­tinc­tive for­ma­tion of Fela him­self, who was born and raised in Nige­ria, stud­ied at the Trin­i­ty Col­lege of Music in Lon­don, and came of age dur­ing the end of Africa’s era of decol­o­niza­tion. To a lis­ten­er reared on Anglo-Amer­i­can pop­u­lar music, his sig­na­ture mix­ture of West African rhythms with jazz and funk tex­tures sounds famil­iar enough — at least for the first ten or fif­teen min­utes, after which time the lis­ten­ing expe­ri­ence ascends to a dif­fer­ent state entire­ly.\nSome­times it takes Fela just about that long to start singing, and when he does, he’s giv­en to procla­ma­tions, chants, calls-and-respons­es, and polit­i­cal exhor­ta­tions deliv­ered in the kind of Eng­lish that sounds high­ly unfa­mil­iar to non-African lis­ten­ers. Not that it’s always alien­at­ing: indeed, this par­tic­u­lar com­bi­na­tion of words and music has cap­ti­vat­ed gen­er­a­tions of lis­ten­ers from far out­side its place of ori­gin. One of them is David Byrne, who used Talk­ing Heads’ Remain in Light as more or less a medi­um for chan­nel­ing the musi­cal spir­it of Fela. Not that he him­self was gone yet: indeed, he had almost two decades of his event­ful life to go, one you can learn much more about from Fela Kuti: Fear No Man, a twelve-part bio­graph­i­cal pod­cast by Jad Abum­rad.\n\nBrought into Fela’s world by a fam­i­ly con­nec­tion, that for­mer Radi­o­lab host con­duct­ed dozens and dozens of inter­views on the rela­tion­ship between the man, his music, and the polit­i­cal con­text in which he found him­self. The facts, as any Fela fan knows, don’t always align com­fort­ably with main­stream sen­si­bil­i­ties of the twen­ty-twen­ties — the charges range from essen­tial­ism to polygamy — but as Lefevre reminds us, an artist should be inter­pret­ed through the lens of his own cul­ture and his­to­ry. How­ev­er many of us con­sid­er him a “prob­lem­at­ic fave” today, Fela Kuti will always be the man who invent­ed Afrobeat — and since nobody else has quite man­aged to repli­cate his grooves in their simul­ta­ne­ous tight­ness and loose­ness, blunt­ness and sub­tle­ty, per­haps also the man who dis­solved it.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAn Intro­duc­tion to the Life & Music of Fela Kuti: Rad­i­cal Niger­ian Band­leader, Polit­i­cal Hero, and Cre­ator of Afrobeat\nWhen Afrobeat Leg­end Fela Kuti Col­lab­o­rat­ed with Cream Drum­mer Gin­ger Bak­er\nZam­rock: An Intro­duc­tion to Zambia’s 1970s Rich & Psy­che­del­ic Rock Scene\nWatch the Talk­ing Heads Play Mate­r­i­al From Their Ground­break­ing Album Remain in Light in an Incred­i­ble Con­cert from 1980\nThe Awe-Inspir­ing But Trag­ic Sto­ry of Africa’s Fes­ti­val In The Desert (2001–2012)\nStream 8,000 Vin­tage Afropop Record­ings Dig­i­tized & Made Avail­able by The British Library\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tDecember 24th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOne can hard­ly con­sid­er the Christ­mas sea­son for long, at least in the Eng­lish-speak­ing world, with­out the work of Charles Dick­ens com­ing to mind. That owes for the most part, of course, to A Christ­mas Car­ol, the novel­la that revived the pub­lic cul­ture of a hol­i­day that had been falling into desue­tude by the mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry. What­ev­er its lit­er­ary short­com­ings, the book offers a host of mem­o­rable images, not least culi­nary ones: Mrs. Cratchit’s pud­ding, for instance, which Dick­ens likens to “a speck­led can­non-ball, so hard and firm, blaz­ing in half or half-a-quar­tern of ignit­ed brandy, and bedight with Christ­mas hol­ly stuck into the top.”\n\n\n\t\n\nIn the Tast­ing His­to­ry video at the top of the post, host Max Miller teach­es you how to make just such a hol­i­day pud­ding — and indeed a fig­gy one, a con­fec­tion whose name we all rec­og­nize from no less a stan­dard car­ol than “We Wish You a Mer­ry Christ­mas,” even if we don’t know that pud­ding, in the Vic­to­ri­an sense, refers to a kind of cake.\nThe fig­gy pud­ding Miller makes from an orig­i­nal 1845 recipe looks, and seems to taste, more like an alco­hol-soaked ver­sion of the fruit­cakes many of us still receive come Christ­mas­time. Despite its rep­u­ta­tion for lead­en unde­sir­abil­i­ty, rein­forced by decade after decade of John­ny Car­son gags, the fruit­cake has a rich his­to­ry, which Miller reveals in the video just above, and culi­nary strengths beyond its extreme shelf life.\n\n\n\t\n\nThis playlist of 20 Christ­mas-themed videos offers many more such delights: Turk­ish delight, for instance, as well as Vic­to­ri­an sug­ar plums, medieval gin­ger­bread, and his­tor­i­cal ver­sions of such still-com­mon com­forts and joys as eggnog and pump­kin pie. And if you’ve ever won­dered to what was­sail — as a noun or a verb — actu­al­ly refers, have a look at the video above, in which Miller explains it all while mak­ing a pot of the stuff, which turns out to be a kind of apple­sauce-enriched ale. Was­sail, too, is a favorite Dick­ens ref­er­ence, and not just in A Christ­mas Car­ol. His first nov­el The Pick­wick Papers includes a Christ­mas feast with “a mighty bowl of was­sail, some­thing small­er than an ordi­nary wash-house cop­per, in which the hot apples were hiss­ing and bub­bling with a rich look, and a jol­ly sound, that were per­fect­ly irre­sistible”: the kind of image that, near­ly two cen­turies lat­er, still makes read­ers want to go a‑wassailing.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nEudo­ra Welty’s Hand­writ­ten Eggnog Recipe, and Charles Dick­ens’ Recipe for Hol­i­day Punch\nTry George Orwell’s Recipe for Christ­mas Pud­ding, from His Essay “British Cook­ery” (1945)\nCharles Min­gus’ “Top Secret” Eggnog Recipe Con­tains “Enough Alco­hol to Put Down an Ele­phant”\nHow Eat­ing Ken­tucky Fried Chick­en Became a Christ­mas Tra­di­tion in Japan\nTast­ing His­to­ry: A Hit YouTube Series Shows How to Cook the Foods of Ancient Greece & Rome, Medieval Europe, and Oth­er Places & Peri­ods\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tDecember 23rd, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nDie Hard is a Christ­mas movie. That once-con­trar­i­an cat­e­go­riza­tion has increas­ing­ly been accept­ed over the past cou­ple of decades, at least since an edi­tor with whom I’ve often worked first declared it in a Slate roundup. As a result, John McTier­nan’s stur­dy piece of one-build­ing eight­ies Hol­ly­wood action may have dis­placed It’s a Won­der­ful Life as a hol­i­day home-video tra­di­tion in cer­tain house­holds. But it’s also stoked a broad­er desire for ever more alter­na­tive Christ­mas movies with sub­tle, even sub­ver­sive hol­i­day ele­ments. If you, too, can’t han­dle yet anoth­er view­ing of Mir­a­cle on 34th Street, A Christ­mas Sto­ry, or Home Alone this year, have a look at the top ten lists com­piled in these four videos, which offer a selec­tion of films beyond — some­times well beyond — the estab­lished sea­son­al canon.\n\n\n\t\n\nThese selec­tions come from a vari­ety of gen­res, includ­ing the super­hero pic­ture: if you haven’t seen Bat­man Returns in a few decades, you may have for­got­ten how thor­ough­ly Tim Bur­ton sat­u­rates it with Christ­mas imagery, albeit of a kind suit­ed to the dank, men­ac­ing Gotham City. Those who want to crank up the dark­ness fur­ther still would do well to put on the Cana­di­an soror­i­ty-house slash­er film Black Christ­mas, which also appears on more than one of these lists.\nJoe Dan­te’s Yule­tide-set Grem­lins con­tains much high­er-bud­get spec­ta­cles of destruc­tion, albeit comedic ones; the humor of Ter­ry Gilliam’s Brazil, anoth­er elab­o­rate mid-eight­ies auteur project, runs to the dystopi­an, a sen­si­bil­i­ty cer­tain­ly present in the hol­i­day sea­son itself, if sel­dom treat­ed with such grotesque vivid­ness.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe work of no sin­gle pro­fes­sion­al makes these alter­na­tive Christ­mas movie lists more often than Shane Black, the writer of Lethal Weapon (with Die Hard, the mak­ings of a hol­i­day dou­ble bill if ever there was one) and The Long Kiss Good­night, as well as the writer-direc­tor of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3, and The Nice Guys. That all of those pic­tures are set at Christ­mas­time makes them feel — no mat­ter how height­ened, fan­tas­ti­cal, or visu­al effects-sat­u­rat­ed they may be — pal­pa­bly con­nect­ed to our own real­i­ty. It also tends to inten­si­fy the dra­ma: as Black remarked in one inter­view, “Christ­mas rep­re­sents a lit­tle stut­ter in the march of days, a hush in which we have a chance to assess and ret­ro­spect our lives.” Which hard­ly means, of course, that it can’t be enter­tain­ing.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch San­ta Claus, the Ear­li­est Movie About San­ta in Exis­tence (1898)\nWatch The Insects’ Christ­mas from 1913: A Stop Motion Film Star­ring a Cast of Dead Bugs\nAn Ani­mat­ed Christ­mas Fable by Mau­rice Sendak (1977)\nThe Junky’s Christ­mas: William S.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhat is the value of knowledge? A coffee shop latte easily costs six dollars or more these days, but peruse any used book sale and you’ll find classics of literature and science for mere cents—published works that have had an indelible impact on culture.\nIn many cases, mass production has rendered the value of books—as objects—at pennies. Used bookstores with buy-back policies often play a vital role in simply being able to properly recycle or dispose of volumes that are no longer salable. Hundreds of millions of books are tossed each year, whether due to overstock, age, or damage, which is an ongoing problem for the publishing industry.\n“The New American” (2021), hardcover book, acrylic varnish, 6.75 x 4.125 x 1.875 inches\nWhile some genres have fallen out of widespread use in our digital age, such as encyclopedia sets, what happens to them after they’re no longer needed is an ongoing sustainability challenge. For artists like Brian Dettmer, an out-of-date reference book isn’t a useless item but a trove of imagery and formal possibilities.\nIn the artist’s solo exhibition, In·Formation at Riverside Arts Center, work made over the past few years explores collage and sculpture through the medium of books. From cut-up elements interwoven into wall reliefs to freestanding forms made from carving directly into thick tomes, Dettmer highlights the afterlife of hardcover publications like dictionaries, atlases, guides, and other reference titles. He often meticulously splices elements together to create layered, stacked, and diorama-stuffed assemblages.\n“There is a randomness to what is revealed, followed by the thoughtfulness of what should remain,” the gallery says. “With each incision, Dettmer strips away layers to expose previously hidden texts and images, often editing the material and assembling it with his own vernacular that suggests new information.” What the artist chooses to reveal, conceal, or even redact—such as the titles on the spines of selected copies used in “Great Houses of Gardening Corners,” for example—nods to our increasingly tenuous relationship with how information is conveyed to us.\nIn·Formation continues through January 24 in Riverside, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

His influential shadow boxes, lovingly composed from mementos, curios, images clipped from their literature, and ordinary or ephemeral objects that he came across, became dimensional worlds of wonder that laid the foundations for assemblage and installation art.The source material of those worlds, squirreled away in storage boxes or stacked on nearly every surface in Cornell's basement studio at his home along Utopia Parkway in Queens, is reconvened in a new devotional exhibition that recreates the late artist's workspace. Gagosian curator Jasper Sharp and filmmaker Wes Anderson co-developed the exhibition at the gallery's storefront location in Paris, the city Cornell knew intimately and deeply longed for, but ultimately never visited. Installation view of another corner of Joseph Cornell's restaged studio (photo by Thomas Lannes)“The location itself could not be more fitting: Paris was a place Cornell dreamed of his entire life,” Sharp said of The House on Utopia Parkway: Joseph Cornell’s Studio Re-Created by Wes Anderson, on view through March 14, in an essay about the show.Sharp noted that during one of his first encounters with Marcel Duchamp, who would become a close friend of Cornell's, the pair had a long conversation about the city, highlighting landmarks such as the Louvre Museum and the historic Place de l’Opéra. “Only at the end of the conversation did Cornell mention that he had never in fact visited the city, an admission that left Duchamp speechless,” Sharp wrote.Works by Joseph Cornell, left to right: “Chambre Gothique 'Moutarde Dijon'” (1950) (photo courtesy Michael Rosenfeld Gallery and Gagosian), “Untitled (Medici Series, Pinturicchio Boy)” (c. 1950) (photo by Owen Conway), “Pharmacy” (1943) (photo by Dominique Uldry)Though many of Cornell's shadow boxes and collages live in institutional collections, the artist's sister gifted his collected source materials, letters and journals, library, and other personal effects to the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 1978, six years after he died. Now, through Anderson's fastidious eye and exhibition designer Cécile Degos's expertise, The House on Utopia Parkway has reunited some of Cornell's most noteworthy shadow boxes with his meticulously restaged studio filled with over 300 original objects he collected over his lifetime. Works including “Pharmacy” (1943),  “A Dressing Room for Gille” (1939), and “Flemish Princess” (c. 1950) physically command visitors' attention as they sit below eye level on scrappy wooden tables up front. In the background, dozens upon dozens of cardboard boxes labeled in Cornell's painted lettering are crammed into a ceiling-high bookshelf. At another corner of the studio below shelves of collected curios, inspirational ephemera are haphazardly strewn across a table equipped with a typewriter, wood glue, ink jars, and a painted wooden parrot, among other needful tools.  An exterior view of The House on Utopia Parkway: Joseph Cornell's Studio Re-Created by Wes Anderson (photo by Thomas Lannes)Cornell devoted many boxes to his loved ones, several artists he was friends with, and women he was deeply enthralled with. In an ultimate act of appreciation for the artist's practice, The House on Utopia Parkway itself becomes a shadow box, viewed only through the windows of Gagosian's softly lit storefront.

(photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)\n    \n        \n            Banksy has struck again, revealing a new mural on a quiet cobblestoned street in the London neighborhood of Bayswater just days before Christmas. Depicting two bundled-up children lying down and stargazing, the stenciled street art that appeared over a row of garages could be a reference to the estimated 102,000 unhoused children residing in temporary accommodations in the capital city. Though the anonymous artist claimed responsibility for the street art along Queen's Mews in Bayswater in an Instagram post, the same motif also appeared on a concrete divider outside the Centre Point tower in Central London. Banksy has not indicated that he is responsible for the identical work by the tower; however, its location is especially significant.People walk by the Centrepoint building stencil on December 22, 2025 in London, England. (photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)Nicknamed the “North Star” locally, the Centre Point tower is a Brutalist behemoth that was constructed between 1963 and 1966 as an office building but stood empty for practically a decade after its completion. In 1969, Reverend Ken Leech, an Anglican socialist minister who worked specifically with youths struggling with homelessness and addiction, opened the basement of the nearby St. Anne's Church as a temporary shelter. He named it Centrepoint after the tower, which he regarded as an “affront to the homeless.” The shelter has since grown into one of the nation's leading support organizations for unhoused youths. Come 1974, while the United Kingdom weathered through a severe recession and chronic housing crisis, nearly 100 Londoners stormed and occupied the empty tower in protest of the mounting homelessness across the city, while thousands of buildings were vacant. Little has changed in the way of affordability, housing accessibility, and food insecurity across the UK. Newly released research indicates that nearly 300,000 families are facing acute homelessness in England alone as of 2025.Banksy, whose guerrilla art practice has long championed anti-war messaging worldwide, frequently comments on current events and crises through his street art. Most recently, he painted a mural depicting a judge beating a protester with his gavel outside of London's Royal Courts of Justice building in September after 900 people had been arrested for protesting the government's designation of the activist organization Palestine Action as a terrorist group. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Banksy\n                      \n                      \n                        London\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Around me are those cutting wreaths down to size, taking selfies, begging their parents for a bigger tree, and lugging them away. Despite the cold, the uncertainty, the relentlessness of the news cycle, it makes me feel grounded, in community — which is what the holiday season is about. I'd like to take a moment to thank you for being part of our community, whether you are a reader, a subscriber, or a paid member.We're in an interesting time of the year — not just the holiday season, but also that in-between time when we've elected a new mayor, but he hasn't been sworn in. It's the season for gratitude, but if I know anything about New York, it's that it always looks forward. In that spirit, I beseech you to read Sami Abu Shumays's open letter to the next mayoral administration. One stat I simply can't get over: The city currently gives The Met more money each year than every single institution in Queens and Staten Island combined. Let's see city government put our money where its mouth is. Wherever you're headed this week, whether you're just hopping on the subway or taking a flight, we hope it's absolutely lovely.

Crucially, Shumays emphasizes that he's not asking for special carve-outs for artists — funding culture more equitably is part and parcel of the general affordability reforms Mamdani's championing.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tJanuary 14th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nFormed in 1965, the Doors burned hot until Jim Mor­ri­son died in 1971, and the band final­ly broke up in 1973. The group left behind more than a few fine songs—“Light My Fire,” “Break On Through (To the Oth­er Side),” “L.A. Woman,” and “Road­house Blues,” to name a few. Above, the music col­lec­tive Play­ing for Change pays trib­ute to anoth­er Doors clas­sic, “Rid­ers on the Storm.” Fea­tur­ing per­for­mances by the two sur­viv­ing Doors mem­bers John Dens­more and Rob­by Krieger, the video also weaves in appear­ances by 20+ musi­cians, every­one from Lukas and Mic­ah Nel­son, to Don Was and Foo Fight­ers key­boardist Rami Jaf­fee. Accord­ing to Play­ing for Change, the “per­for­mance reimag­ines the clas­sic anthem as a med­i­ta­tion on uni­ty, hope, and shared human­i­ty,” qual­i­ties that oth­er­wise seem in short sup­ply today.

    "body": "\n\tin Life, Music |   \tJanuary 14th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nImag­ine, if you will, tak­ing a seat at the piano before a full house of 2,000 music lovers ready to hear Mozart’s Piano Con­cer­to No. 20 in D minor — and, more impor­tant­ly, on stage with an orches­tra and con­duc­tor more than ready to play it. That would be dif­fi­cult enough, but now imag­ine that you thought you were sup­posed to play the Piano Con­cer­to No.23 in A major, anoth­er piece of music entire­ly. This is the stuff of night­mares, and indeed, the very sit­u­a­tion in which pianist Maria João Pires found her­self in 2013, after she’d been recruit­ed to fill in for anoth­er play­er at an open rehearsal held at Ams­ter­dam’s Con­cert­ge­bouw. You can watch it unfold, assum­ing you can bear it, in the clip above.\nAs Pires says in the Clas­sic FM inter­view below, it had been “per­haps 11 months” since she’d last played the piece into which she could hear the orches­tra launch­ing, “and that’s the moment where you start los­ing the mem­o­ry of the details. That’s how the mem­o­ry func­tions, you know. And when peo­ple see this pan­ic, they per­haps don’t know that the real­i­ty is, we lose our mem­o­ries after just a cou­ple of months.”\nIt seems to have been the encour­age­ment of con­duc­tor Ric­car­do Chail­ly that got her through the moment of pan­ic and into a cred­itable per­for­mance. “You know it so well!” he insist­ed to her, and indeed, as he remem­bered lat­er, “The mir­a­cle is that she has such a mem­o­ry that she could, with­in a minute, switch to a new con­cer­to with­out mak­ing one mis­take.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe eleventh-hour call Pires received ask­ing her to take the gig was part of the prob­lem, but so was a mis­heard num­ber. Accord­ing to the Köchel cat­a­logue, which orga­nizes all of Mozart’s work, the Piano Con­cer­to No. 20 in D minor is 466, where­as the Piano Con­cer­to No. 23 in A major is 488. Whether Pires mis­heard the K‑number or the caller mis­spoke, she soon found her­self faced with a musi­cal chal­lenge for which she felt com­plete­ly unpre­pared. In fact, she was­n’t: as Chail­ly knew, or at least banked on, her career as a clas­si­cal pianist up to that point had giv­en her all the expe­ri­ence she need­ed to draw upon to over­come the cri­sis. As her recov­ery reminds us, pro­fes­sion­al­ism isn’t so much about mak­ing sure that things always go right as being able to han­dle it when they go wrong. It hap­pens that Pires has gone through this par­tic­u­lar kind of mix-up three times, which makes her a con­sum­mate pro­fes­sion­al indeed.\nvia MyMod­ern­Met\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Kei­th Jar­rett Played on a Bro­ken Piano & Turned a Poten­tial­ly Dis­as­trous Con­cert Into the Best-Sell­ing Piano Album of All Time (1975)\nWatch the First Per­for­mance of a Mozart Com­po­si­tion That Had Been Lost for Cen­turies\nHear the Exper­i­men­tal Piano Jazz Album by Come­di­an H.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tJanuary 13th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHuman­i­ty was already enjoy­ing motion pic­tures a cen­tu­ry ago. But the abil­i­ty to do so at home still lay a few decades in the future, and the abil­i­ty to pull up a movie on demand through a stream­ing ser­vice much fur­ther still. Young peo­ple in the twen­ty-twen­ties may be unable to fath­om how pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions got by with­out Net­flix and the like, but all of us, what­ev­er our age, may be curi­ous about what such plat­forms would have offered in the nine­teen-twen­ties. Now we can see for our­selves on Wik­i­Flix, a free stream­ing site that offers more than 4,000 pub­lic-domain films for our enjoy­ment. Cur­rent­ly hot on its front page: Fritz Lang’s Metrop­o­lis, Sergei Eisen­stein’s Bat­tle­ship Potemkin, and F. W. Mur­nau’s Nos­fer­atu.\n\n\n\t\n\nEven casu­al film-lovers will know those impor­tant titles, even if they have yet to watch the pic­tures them­selves. Reg­u­lar Open Cul­ture read­ers may also spot more than a few movies pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here: Georges Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon; Lotte Reiniger’s The Adven­tures of Prince Achmed; William Cameron Men­zies’ (H. G. Wells-script­ed) Things to Come; Ida Lupino’s The Hitch-Hik­er.\nThere’s also Stan­ley Donen’s Cha­rade, the best film Alfred Hitch­cock nev­er made — as well as some of the films he did make, like The Lodger, Jamaica Inn, and Noto­ri­ous. Hitch­cock­’s Mur­der! was one of the works from 1930 that just came avail­able on Pub­lic Domain Day at the begin­ning of this month, along with the likes of the Marx Broth­ers-star­ring Ani­mal Crack­ers and the Best Pic­ture-win­ning All Qui­et on the West­ern Front.\n\n\n\t\n\nNot all the movies on Wik­i­Flix are at least 95 years old. Some have fall­en into the pub­lic domain for rea­sons oth­er than sheer age. Oth­ers, like Nina Paley’s Sita Sings the Blues, were made freely avail­able by their cre­ators upon release; browse the site by year, and you can find plen­ty of oth­er recent pro­duc­tions. On the list of sec­tions, you can also orga­nize your view­ing options by coun­try, fre­quen­cy of cita­tion on Wikipedia (whose vol­un­teer com­mu­ni­ty cre­at­ed Wik­i­Flix), or genre. How about a film noir tonight? A bud­dy pic­ture? Some form of exploita­tion? Per­haps a B west­ern? As TechCrunch’s Aman­da Sil­ber­ling writes, “Why not watch a Sovi­et musi­cal inspired by Cin­derel­la, a silent film about swash­buck­ling pirates, or a Japan­ese post-apoc­a­lyp­tic film that fea­tures a guy who some­how played for both the Boston Celtics and the Chica­go Cubs?” With It’s a Won­der­ful Life on there, you at least know you’re set for next Christ­mas.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\n4,000+ Free Movies Online: Great Clas­sics, Indies, Noir, West­erns, Doc­u­men­taries & More\nDown­load 9,200+ Free Films from the Prelinger Archives: Doc­u­men­taries, Car­toons & More\nWatch 3,000+ Films Free Online from the Nation­al Film Board of Cana­da\n60 Free Film Noir Movies You Can Watch Online, Includ­ing Clas­sics by John Hus­ton, Orson Welles & Fritz Lang\nWatch 70+ Clas­sic Lit­er­ary Films Free Online: The Snows of Kil­i­man­jaro, Gulliver’s Trav­els, Jane Eyre, and More\nWhat’s Enter­ing the Pub­lic Domain in 2026: Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying, All Qui­et on the West­ern Front, Bet­ty Boop & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nOne poten­tial draw­back of genius, it seems, is rest­less­ness, a mind per­pet­u­al­ly on the move. Of course, this is what makes many cel­e­brat­ed thinkers and artists so pro­duc­tive. That and the extra hours some gain by sac­ri­fic­ing sleep. Voltaire report­ed­ly drank up to 50 cups of cof­fee a day, and seems to have suf­fered no par­tic­u­lar­ly ill effects. Balzac did the same, and died at 51. The caf­feine may have had some­thing to do with it. Both Socrates and Samuel John­son believed that sleep is wast­ed time, and “so for years has thought grey-haired Richard Buck­min­ster Fuller,” wrote Time mag­a­zine in 1943, “futu­rif­ic inven­tor of the Dymax­ion house, the Dymax­ion car and the Dymax­ion globe.”\nEngi­neer and vision­ary Fuller intend­ed his “Dymax­ion” brand to rev­o­lu­tion­ize every aspect of human life, or—in the now-slight­ly-dat­ed par­lance of our obses­sion with all things hacking—he engi­neered a series of rad­i­cal “life­hacks.” Giv­en his views on sleep, that seem­ing­ly essen­tial activ­i­ty also received a Dymax­ion upgrade, the trade­marked name com­bin­ing “dynam­ic,” “max­i­mum,” and “ten­sion.” “Two hours of sleep a day,” Fuller announced, “is plen­ty.” Did he con­sult with spe­cial­ists? Med­ical doc­tors? Biol­o­gists? Noth­ing as dull as that. He did what many a mad sci­en­tist does in the movies. (In the search, as Vin­cent Price says at the end of The Fly, “for the truth.”) He cooked up a the­o­ry, and test­ed it on him­self.\n“Fuller,” Time report­ed, “rea­soned that man has a pri­ma­ry store of ener­gy, quick­ly replen­ished, and a sec­ondary reserve (sec­ond wind) that takes longer to restore.” He hypoth­e­sized that we would need less sleep if we stopped to take a nap at “the first sign of fatigue.” Fuller trained him­self to do just that, for­go­ing the typ­i­cal eight hours, more or less, most of us get per night. He found—as have many artists and researchers over the years—that “after a half-hour nap he was com­plete­ly refreshed.” Naps every six hours allowed him to shrink his total sleep per 24-hour peri­od to two hours. Did he, like the 50s mad sci­en­tist, become a trag­ic vic­tim of his own exper­i­ment?\nNo dan­ger of merg­ing him with a fly or turn­ing him invis­i­ble. The exper­i­men­t’s fail­ure may have meant a day in bed catch­ing up on lost sleep. Instead, Fuller kept it up for two full years, 1932 and 1933, and report­ed feel­ing in “the most vig­or­ous and alert con­di­tion that I have ever enjoyed.” He might have slept two hours a day in 30 minute incre­ments indef­i­nite­ly, Time sug­gests, but found that his “busi­ness asso­ciates… insist­ed on sleep­ing like oth­er men,” and wouldn’t adapt to his eccen­tric sched­ule, though some not for lack of try­ing. In his book Buck­y­Works J. Bald­win claims, “I can per­son­al­ly attest that many of his younger col­leagues and stu­dents could not keep up with him. He nev­er seemed to tire.”\nA research orga­ni­za­tion looked into the sleep sys­tem and “not­ed that not every­one was able to train them­selves to sleep on com­mand.” The point may seem obvi­ous to the sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of peo­ple who suf­fer from insom­nia. “Bucky dis­con­cert­ed observers,” Bald­win writes, “by going to sleep in thir­ty sec­onds, as if he had thrown an Off switch in his head. It hap­pened so quick­ly that it looked like he had had a seizure.” Buck­min­ster Fuller was undoubt­ed­ly an unusu­al human, but human all the same. Time report­ed that “most sleep inves­ti­ga­tors agree that the first hours of sleep are the sound­est.” A Col­gate Uni­ver­si­ty researcher at the time dis­cov­ered that “peo­ple awak­ened after four hours’ sleep were just as alert, well-coor­di­nat­ed phys­i­cal­ly and resis­tant to fatigue” as those who slept the full eight.\nSleep research since the for­ties has made a num­ber of oth­er find­ings about vari­able sleep sched­ules among humans, study­ing shift work­ers’ sleep and the so-called “bipha­sic” pat­tern com­mon in cul­tures with very late bed­times and sies­tas in the mid­dle of the day. The suc­cess of this sleep rhythm “con­tra­dicts the nor­mal idea of a monopha­sic sleep­ing sched­ule,” writes Evan Mur­ray at MIT’s Cul­ture Shock, “in which all our time asleep is lumped into one block.” Bipha­sic sleep results in six or sev­en hours of sleep rather than the sev­en to nine of monopha­sic sleep­ers. Polypha­sic sleep­ing, how­ev­er, the kind pio­neered by Fuller, seems to gen­uine­ly result in even less need­ed sleep for many. It’s an idea that’s only become wide­spread “with­in rough­ly the last decade,” Mur­ray not­ed in 2009. He points to the redis­cov­ery, with­out any clear indebt­ed­ness, of Fuller’s Dymax­ion sys­tem by col­lege stu­dent Maria Staver, who named her method “Uber­man,” in hon­or of Niet­zsche, and spread its pop­u­lar­i­ty through a blog and a book.\nMur­ray also reports on anoth­er blog­ger, Steve Pavli­na, who con­duct­ed the exper­i­ment on him­self and found that “over a peri­od of 5 1/2 months, he was suc­cess­ful in adapt­ing com­plete­ly,” reap­ing the ben­e­fits of increased pro­duc­tiv­i­ty. But like Fuller, Pavli­na gave it up, not for “health rea­sons,” but because, he wrote, “the rest of the world is monopha­sic” or close to it. Our long block of sleep appar­ent­ly con­tains a good deal of “wast­ed tran­si­tion time” before we arrive at the nec­es­sary REM state. Polypha­sic sleep trains our brains to get to REM more quick­ly and effi­cient­ly. For this rea­son, writes Mur­ray, “I believe it can work for every­one.” Per­haps it can, pro­vid­ed they are will­ing to bear the social cost of being out of sync with the rest of the world. But peo­ple like­ly to prac­tice Dymax­ion Sleep for sev­er­al months or years prob­a­bly already are.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Pow­er of Pow­er Naps: Sal­vador Dali Teach­es You How Micro-Naps Can Give You Cre­ative Inspi­ra­tion\nPeo­ple in the Mid­dle Ages Slept Not Once But Twice Each Night: How This Lost Prac­tice Was Redis­cov­ered\nBertrand Rus­sell & Buck­min­ster Fuller on Why We Should Work Less, and Live & Learn More\nEvery­thing I Know: 42 Hours of Buck­min­ster Fuller’s Vision­ary Lec­tures Free Online (1975)\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nColossal has always emphasized great imagery when sharing art, photography, design, and more. We’re often thinking about ways to make the site more interactive and highlight all the phenomenal visuals. This week, we launched a new gallery feature.\nIn the body of any article, you can now click on images, and they will open in a gallery, free from text distractions other than the caption information—if available.\nNavigate with your mouse by clicking the arrows at the bottom of the window, or use your keyboard’s arrow keys to navigate back and forth. If you use the arrow keys or click anywhere outside of the black navigation bar, the bar and the caption (if there is one) will disappear, leaving just the image in your browser window. To exit, simply hit the little “x” in the upper right corner. Happy scrolling!\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor the Chicana feminist theorist Gloria Anzaldúa, rigidity is a sure path to demise. In her manifesto, Borderlands/La Frontera, Anzaldúa presents what she calls a new mestiza consciousness, which advocates for ambiguity and moves “toward a more whole perspective, one that includes rather than excludes.”\nGroundbreaking when it was published in 1987, this theory pushed queer, feminist, and cultural scholars to consider how identity is both fluid and informed by several overlapping factors. It also helped to lay the groundwork for branches of study like ecofeminism, which connects the subjugation of women to the subjugation of nature.\n“Ritual a las faldas de un volcán” (2025), oil on linen, 120 x 90 x 4 centimeters\nMexican artist Hilda Palafox draws on these lines of inquiry in her exhibition De Tierra y Susurros, or Of Soil and Whispers. Comprised of oil paintings on linen and carved cantera reliefs, this body of work considers a spiritual connection between women and nature and the possibilities for attuning ourselves to our environment once again. “For me, the point where two lines meet lies precisely there: in the conscious decision to pause, to listen, and to pay closer attention,” the artist says in a statement.\nOften capturing a moment of respite, several of Palafox’s paintings depict tender acts of care. “Origen,” for example, features two topless figures in the fetal position, cradling a sapling, while “Presagio” is similarly delicate as small yellow butterflies emerge between two women. One of the fluttering insects even lands on a fraying chain-link fence in the foreground, a metaphor for the rigid systems, both internal and external, that Anzaldúa opposed. \nPalafox has long been interested in how our bodies inform our experiences, and earlier works typically played with scale and proportion to explore such connections. In De Tierra y Susurros, the artist extends these metaphors to more directly incorporate ecology through a rich palette of Earth tones and vast landscapes that highlight the relationship between humanity and nature. A series of reliefs titled Portrals further entrenches Palafox’s attraction to the in between, as fragments of figures and flora intertwine to form ambiguous intersections. \nDe Tierra y Susurros is on view through February 21 at Sean Kelly, New York. Keep up with Palafox on Instagram.\n“Presagio” (2025), oil on linen, 180 x 140 x 4 centimeters\n“Custodia” (2025), diptych oil on linen, 220 x 240 x 4 centimeters\n“Portal III” (2025), low relief in Mexican cantera stone, 43.5 x 35 x 4 centimeters\n“Susurros II” (2025), oil on linen, 140 x 130 x 4 centimeters\n“Tierra sombra tostada” (2025), diptych oil and wax on linen, 140 x 440 x 4 centimeters\n“Resiliencia I” (2025), oil on linen,  180 x 160 x 4 centimeters\n“Portal I” (2025), low relief in Mexican cantera stone, 43.5 x 35 x 4 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, Sci Fi |   \tNovember 5th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn the whole of Alien, the tit­u­lar enti­ty only appears on screen for about three min­utes. That’s one rea­son the movie holds up so well against the oth­er crea­ture fea­tures of its era: in glimpses, you nev­er get a chance to reg­is­ter signs of the alien’s being an arti­fi­cial con­struc­tion. That’s not to say it was a shod­dy piece of work; quite the con­trary, as explained in the new video above from Cin­e­maTyler. Its cre­ation demand­ed the ded­i­cat­ed efforts of an inter­na­tion­al group of pro­fes­sion­als includ­ing spe­cial effects artist Car­lo Ram­bal­di, who’d engi­neered the giant ape head in the 1976 King Kong remake and the aliens in Close Encoun­ters of the Third Kind (and would lat­er work on an even more icon­ic extrater­res­tri­al for E.T.).\nCharged with design­ing the alien, and even­tu­al­ly with over­see­ing its fab­ri­ca­tion and assem­bly, was the artist H. R. Giger, whose artis­tic sen­si­bil­i­ty occu­pied the inter­sec­tion of organ­ism and machine, Eros and Thanatos. Though it’s most thor­ough­ly expressed in the dead­ly crea­ture that stows away aboard the space tug Nos­tro­mo, it also, to one degree or anoth­er, per­vades the whole movie’s look and feel.\nWhether from the late sev­en­ties or any oth­er peri­od, the usu­al sleek, anti­sep­tic sci-fi futures date rather quick­ly, a con­di­tion hard­ly suf­fered by the unre­lieved­ly dark, dank, and dys­func­tion­al set­ting of Alien. This sur­pris­ing­ly grimy real­ism makes the threat of the alien feel that much more real; hid­den in its many shad­ows, Giger’s vision preys that much more effec­tive­ly on our imag­i­na­tion.\nNot that it was guar­an­teed to suc­ceed in doing so. As Cin­e­maTyler explains, the process of cre­at­ing the alien came up against count­less set­backs, all under increas­ing­ly severe con­straints of both time and bud­get. At times the pro­duc­tion got lucky, as when it hap­pened upon the near­ly sev­en-foot-tall Bola­ji Bade­jo, who end­ed up wear­ing the alien cos­tume (despite Scot­t’s insis­tence, ear­ly in the pro­duc­tion, that he did­n’t want to make a movie about “a man in a suit”). But it was attempt­ing to cre­ate a being of a kind nev­er seen on screen before, one that had to be devel­oped through tri­al and error, more often the lat­ter than the for­mer. And it was hard­ly the only dif­fi­cult aspect of the mak­ing of Alien, as evi­denced by the eleven-and-count­ing episodes of Cin­e­maTyler’s series on the sub­ject. Maybe in space, no one can hear you scream, but one can eas­i­ly imag­ine the cries of frus­tra­tion let out by Scott, Giger, and all their pres­sured col­lab­o­ra­tors down here on Earth.\nRelat­ed Content:\nThe Giger Bar: Dis­cov­er the 1980s Tokyo Bar Designed by H.

    "body": "\n\tin Astronomy, Books, History |   \tNovember 5th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nFrom the mighty Maya civ­i­liza­tion, which dom­i­nat­ed Mesoamer­i­ca for more than three and a half mil­len­nia, we have exact­ly four books. Only one of them pre­dates the arrival of Span­ish con­quis­ta­dors in the six­teenth cen­tu­ry: the Códice Maya de Méx­i­co, or Maya Codex of Mex­i­co, which was cre­at­ed between 1021 and 1152. Though incom­plete, and hard­ly in good shape oth­er­wise, its art­work — col­ored in places with pre­cious mate­ri­als — vivid­ly evokes an ancient world­view now all but lost. In the video above from the Get­ty Muse­um and Smarthis­to­ry, art his­to­ri­ans Andrew Turn­er and Lau­ren Kil­roy-Ewbank tell us what we’re look­ing at when we behold the remains of this sacred Mayan book, the old­est ever found in the Amer­i­c­as.\n“This book has a con­tro­ver­sial his­to­ry,” says Turn­er. “It was long con­sid­ered to be a fake due to the strange cir­cum­stances in which it sur­faced.” After its dis­cov­ery in a pri­vate col­lec­tion in Mex­i­co City in the nine­teen-six­ties, it was rumored to have been loot­ed from a cave in Chi­a­pas.\nAt first pro­nounced a fake by experts, due to its lack of resem­blance to the oth­er extant Mayan texts, it was only ver­i­fied as the gen­uine arti­cle in 2018. For a non-spe­cial­ist, the ques­tion remains: what is the Códice about? Its pur­pose, as Kil­roy-Ewbank puts it, is astro­nom­i­cal, relay­ing as it does “infor­ma­tion about the cycle of the plan­et Venus” — which, as Turn­er adds, “was con­sid­ered a dan­ger­ous plan­et” by the Mayans.\n\nThe Códice con­tains records of Venus’ 584-day cycle over the course of 140 years, tes­ti­fy­ing to the scruti­ny Mayan astronomers gave to its com­pli­cat­ed pat­tern of ris­ing and falling. They thus man­aged to deter­mine — as many ancient civ­i­liza­tions did not — that it was both the Morn­ing Star and the Evening Star, although they seem to have been more inter­est­ed in what its move­ments revealed about the inten­tions of the deities they saw as con­trol­ling it, and thus the like­li­hood of events like war or famine. Those gods weren’t benev­o­lent: one page shows “a fright­ful skele­tal deity that has a blunt knife stick­ing out of his nasal cav­i­ty,” hold­ing “a giant jagged blade up” with one hand and “the hair of a cap­tive whose head he’s fresh­ly sev­ered” with the oth­er. That’s hard­ly the sort of image that comes to our mod­ern minds when we gaze up at the night sky, but then, we don’t see things like the Mayans did.\nvia Aeon\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nA 16th-Cen­tu­ry Astron­o­my Book Fea­tured “Ana­log Com­put­ers” to Cal­cu­late the Shape of the Moon, the Posi­tion of the Sun, and More\nA 400-Year-Old Ring that Unfolds to Track the Move­ments of the Heav­ens\nBehold the Astro­nom­icum Cae­sareum, “Per­haps the Most Beau­ti­ful Sci­en­tif­ic Book Ever Print­ed” (1540)\nThe Ancient Astron­o­my of Stone­henge Decod­ed\nExplore the Flo­ren­tine Codex: A Bril­liant 16th Cen­tu­ry Man­u­script Doc­u­ment­ing Aztec Cul­ture Is Now Dig­i­tized & Avail­able Online\nHow the Ancient Mayans Used Choco­late as Mon­ey\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tNovember 4th, 2025  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMar­lon Bran­do has now been gone for more than two decades, and so thor­ough­go­ing was his impact on the art of film act­ing that younger gen­er­a­tions of movie-lovers may have trou­ble pin­ning down what, exact­ly, he did so dif­fer­ent­ly on screen. In the new video above, Evan “Nerd­writer” Puschak shows them — and reminds us — using a sin­gle scene from Elia Kazan’s On the Water­front. No, it’s not the scene you’re think­ing of even if you’ve nev­er seen the movie: Puschak selects an ear­li­er one, a con­ver­sa­tion between Bran­do’s prize­fight­er-turned-long­shore­man Ter­ry Mal­loy and Eva Marie Sain­t’s young Edie Doyle, the sis­ter of the col­league Ter­ry unknow­ing­ly lured to his death.\nWhen Edie asks Ter­ry how he got into box­ing, Ter­ry glances at the floor while launch­ing into his answer. “It’s hard to over­state how rev­o­lu­tion­ary a choice like this was in 1954,” says Puschak. “Actors just did­n’t get dis­tract­ed in this way. Trained in the­atri­cal tech­niques, they hit their spots, artic­u­lat­ed their lines, and per­formed instant­ly leg­i­ble emo­tions for the audi­ence. They did­n’t pause a con­ver­sa­tion to look under the table, turn­ing their head away from the micro­phone in the process, and they cer­tain­ly did­n’t speak while chew­ing food.” Just a few years ear­li­er, “the famous Bran­do mum­ble” would have been unthink­able in a fea­ture film; after On the Water­front, it became an endur­ing part of pop­u­lar cul­ture.\nMuch of the evo­lu­tion of the motion pic­ture is the sto­ry of its lib­er­a­tion from the tropes of the­ater. The ear­li­est nar­ra­tive films amount­ed to lit­tle more than doc­u­men­ta­tions of stage per­for­mances, sta­t­i­cal­ly framed from the famil­iar per­spec­tive of a spec­ta­tor’s seat. Just as the devel­op­ment of the tech­nol­o­gy and tech­niques for cam­era move­ment and edit­ing allowed cin­e­ma to come into its own on the visu­al lev­el, the nature of the actors’ per­for­mances also had to change. In the mid-nine­teen-for­ties, the elec­tri­fied micro­phone allowed Frank Sina­tra to sing with the cadence and sub­tle­ty of speech; not long there­after, Bran­do took sim­i­lar advan­tage of the tech­no­log­i­cal capa­bil­i­ty of film to cap­ture a range of what would come to be known as his own sig­na­ture idio­syn­crasies.\nOn the Water­front opened fair­ly close on the heels of the Bran­do-star­ring A Street­car Named Desire and The Wild One; still to come were the likes of One-Eyed Jacks, The God­fa­ther, Last Tan­go in Paris, and Apoc­a­lypse Now. While Bran­do did­n’t appear exclu­sive­ly in acclaimed pic­tures — espe­cial­ly in the lat­er decades of his career — nev­er did he give a whol­ly unin­ter­est­ing per­for­mance. Incor­po­rat­ing the tics, hitch­es, and self-sti­fling impuls­es that afflict all our real-life com­mu­ni­ca­tion, he under­stood the poten­tial of both real­ism and odd­i­ty to bring a char­ac­ter’s inte­ri­or­i­ty out into the open, usu­al­ly against that char­ac­ter’s will. But he nev­er could’ve done it with­out his fel­low per­form­ers to act and react against, not least the for­mi­da­ble Eva Marie Saint: at 101 years old, one of our few liv­ing con­nec­tions to the vital, decep­tive­ly har­row­ing realm of post­war Hol­ly­wood cin­e­ma.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nMar­lon Bran­do Screen Tests for Rebel With­out A Cause (1947)\nWhen Mar­lon Bran­do Refused the Oscar for His Role in The God­fa­ther to Sup­port the Rights of Native Amer­i­cans (1973)\nThe God­fa­ther With­out Bran­do?: Cop­po­la Explains How It Almost Hap­pened\nHow Humphrey Bog­a­rt Became an Icon: A Video Essay\nWhy James Gandolfini’s Tony Sopra­no Is “the Great­est Act­ing Achieve­ment Ever Com­mit­ted to the Screen”: A Video Essay\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture |   \tNovember 4th, 2025  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\nLook up the word archi­tec­ture in the dic­tio­nary, and though you won’t actu­al­ly find a pic­ture of Frank Lloyd Wright, it may feel as if you should. Or at least it will feel that way if you’re look­ing in an Amer­i­can dic­tio­nary, giv­en that Wright has been regard­ed as the per­son­i­fi­ca­tion of Amer­i­can archi­tec­ture longer than any of us have been alive. Exact­ly when he gained that sta­tus isn’t easy to pin down. Like all archi­tects, he began his career unknown; only lat­er did even his ear­ly solo works from around the turn of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, like his pri­vate home and stu­dio and the Uni­ty Tem­ple, both in Oak Park, Illi­nois, become sites of pil­grim­age. By 1935, how­ev­er, Wright’s name had long since been inter­na­tion­al­ly made — and unmade.\n\n\n\t\n\nFor­tu­nate­ly for him, that was the year he designed the Edgar J. Kauf­mann Sr. House, bet­ter known as Falling­wa­ter, which is now wide­ly con­sid­ered his mas­ter­piece. Nat­u­ral­ly, Falling­wa­ter appears in one of the videos includ­ed in the playlist of short doc­u­men­taries on Wright’s hous­es from Archi­tec­tur­al Digest at the top of the post.\nIt could hard­ly have been oth­er­wise; near­ly as unig­nor­able are his Ari­zona home and stu­dio Tal­iesin West and his much-filmed Maya revival Ennis House in Los Ange­les. Through these videos, you can also get tours of his less­er-known works like Toy Hill House in Pleas­antville, New York; Tir­ran­na in New Canaan, Con­necti­cut; and the Cir­cu­lar Sun House in Phoenix, Ari­zona, his final real­ized home design.\n\n\n\t\n\nFor all the var­ied inter­ests he pur­sued and influ­ences he absorbed, Wright did stick to cer­tain philo­soph­i­cal prin­ci­ples, some of which Archi­tec­tur­al Digest has traced in its videos. Using three dif­fer­ent hous­es, the one just above illu­mi­nates per­haps Wright’s sin­gle most impor­tant guid­ing idea: “A home, he believed, should not be placed upon the land, but grow from it, nat­ur­al, inten­tion­al, and insep­a­ra­ble from the envi­ron­ment around it.” As his archi­tec­ture evolved, he increas­ing­ly “treat­ed the land­scape not as a back­drop, but as a col­lab­o­ra­tor,” cre­at­ing “spaces that invite the out­side in and express the essen­tial prin­ci­ples of organ­ic archi­tec­ture.” Wright’s hous­es can thus be stun­ning in a way we might’ve only thought pos­si­ble in a nat­ur­al land­scape — and, as gen­er­a­tions of buy­ers have found out by now, just as unruly and demand­ing as any pure­ly organ­ic cul­ti­va­tion.\n\n\n\t\n\n\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nFrank Lloyd Wright: America’s Great­est Archi­tect? — A Free Stream­ing Doc­u­men­tary\nA Med­i­ta­tive Tour of Falling­wa­ter, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Archi­tec­tur­al Mas­ter­piece\nWhat Frank Lloyd Wright’s Unusu­al Win­dows Tell Us About His Archi­tec­tur­al Genius\nThat Far Cor­ner: Frank Lloyd Wright in Los Ange­les — A Free Online Doc­u­men­tary\nA Vir­tu­al Tour of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Lost Japan­ese Mas­ter­piece, the Impe­r­i­al Hotel in Tokyo\nFrank Lloyd Wright Designs an Urban Utopia: See His Hand-Drawn Sketch­es of Broad­acre City (1932)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhere technology, time, the cosmos, and perception meet, you’ll find the work of Japanese artist Mariko Mori. The artist has long been interested in the relationship between the individual and the universe—existence itself—which she explores through a range of mediums and immersive experiences. She also draws from the Buddhist philosophy of interconnectedness, which centers around the idea that no living being, object, or event exists in isolation. Everything is linked.\nA recent series of dreamy tondos and luminescent acrylic sculptures make up the artist’s current solo exhibition, Radiance, at Sean Kelly. Comprising abstract, symmetrical, metaphysical forms in bright pastel hues, Mori’s circular Unity compositions emphasize beauty, interdependence, and transcendence.\n“Love II” (2025), Dichroic-coated layered acrylic in two parts with Corian base, 70 7/8 x 29 11/16 x 23 3/8 inches, edition of 1 with 1 AP\nThis body of work delves into Japan’s ancient cultures, especially prehistoric and early historic eras. Mori extensively researched a number of ancient periods during which artistic, philosophical, and social advances took place, like the Jomon era (14,000 to 300 B.C.E.) and Yayoi period (300 B.C.E. to 300 C.E.). She also delved into relatively more recent eras, like the Kofun (250 to 538 C.E.) and Asuka (538 to 710 C.E.) periods.\n“Informed by site visits to sacred geological formations across the Japanese archipelago, including the storied rocks of Okinoshima Island and the shrines of Izumo and Awaji, Mori focuses on these ancestral sites through a contemporary lens,” the gallery says. On Okinoshima, Mori observed sacred rocks known as iwakura, which are believed to contain kami—deities or spirits.\nMori’s Stone series, like “Love II,” re-envision iwakura within the context of the gallery. Made of solid, translucent acrylic that reflects and diffracts light in an almost prismatic effect, visitors are invited into a contemplative experience. “Their dichroic surfaces shift with ambient light and the viewer’s movement, reimagining invisible energies that recall the stones’ original function as portals to the sacred,” says a statement.\nRadiance continues through December 20 in New York.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the Malabar region of Kerala, India, an ancient Hindu ritual known as Theyyam exists in a continuum of ceremonial customs that date back hundreds, if not thousands, of years. The practice carries on today through elaborate costumes and dances during which a performer wears sacred garments and invites a deity to enter their body as a way to seek blessings. Theyyam season, which typically runs from October to May, sees hundreds of performances around the region, with many concentrated in November and December.\n“Theyyam is a reminder that the divine exists within and around us,” says artist Navneet Jayakumar, whose lens-based practice centers around explorations of ethnography and the surreal. “In an age of disconnection, its wisdom has the power to ground us and heal a fragmented world.”\n\nNow based in London, Jayakumar grew up in Malabar, and Theyyam was a memorable part of his childhood. For the first time in 12 years, he returned to Kerala during the ceremonial season and was struck by its intensity and time-honored connection to the region’s cultural heritage. “Witnessing the ritual reignited my curiosity about the broader spiritual and historical context of my culture, the role Theyyam once played in it, and the ways in which colonial narratives had distorted my perception of both,” he says in a statement.\nJayakumar’s series Beyond the Colonial Gaze documents the ancient custom through an ethnographic lens, aiming to highlight an event that’s little understood outside of the region, primarily due to its oral traditions, which make it challenging to research. “With a lack of traceable records exacerbated further by centuries of colonial intervention, I discovered there was very little information available about the ritual’s broader spiritual context,” he says.\nThrough the innately visual medium of photography, Jayakumar set out to record Theyyam to counteract its lack of recognition—especially as an Indigenous tradition that was seen by European colonizers as “uncivilized” or “primitive.” His energetic, glowing images portray meticulously designed costumes and face-painted performers. \nExhibited in different parts of Europe, Jayakumar’s images represent what he describes as “a symbolic victory of a culture that was destroyed and shunned as barbaric but lives on through me and many, many people back home.” Find more on Jayakumar’s website and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDelicate geometries and organic forms combine in the elegant works of Natalie Ciccoricco. Often working with found materials, the California-based artist threads multicolored string through handmade paper. In her ongoing Nesting series, fiber envelops small twigs that gently interrupt the otherwise meticulous shapes—redolent of the way that trees themselves have the ability to grow around fences and other obstacles in their way.\nCiccoricco has also recently been working on a series called Wrapped, a poignant exploration of loss and grief. Small panels collaged with colorful imagery are then wrapped tightly with bands of thin yarn. \n\nThe collection emerged as a deeply personal response to the sudden loss of her son, literally encompassing emotions and experiences that art makes it possible to describe. “These are not somber artworks, but rather an expression of radical acceptance and a surrender to both love and grief,” she says in a statement.\nThe artist has long been interested in the wide variety of ways that paper and fiber interact, from collaging found photographs with yarn details to hand-making paper in bespoke shapes. The sticks used in her latest Nesting works were foraged around her hometown of Budel, The Netherlands, where she spent the summer.\n“Between my own personal grief and the state of the world, I feel my art practice has become an important anchor in my life,” Ciccoricco shares. Her practice—and by extension, her pieces—channel a sense of calm, order, and harmony. “It’s both a tether to something beautiful and familiar, as well as a quiet resistance against all the fear, hate, and violence we are witnessing right now.”\nLately, Ciccoricco has been focusing primarily on commissions, including pieces from the Nesting series at a Big Sur, California, hotel called Alila Ventana. Find more on Ciccoricco’s website and Instagram.\nPieces from the ‘Wrapped’ series\n\n“They Are the Sun and the Moon”\n\n“Still Silently Watching”\nDetails of the ‘Nesting’ series\n\t\n\t\n\t",

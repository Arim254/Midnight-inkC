    "body": "\n\tin Art, Fashion |   \tDecember 26th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nUpon hear­ing the name of Sal­vador Dalí, even a total lay­man in the art world is bound to get visions of melt­ing clocks. Sur­pris­ing­ly, for an artist who showed so much self-mar­ket­ing savvy, Dalí nev­er brought an actu­al time­piece in that dis­tinc­tive­ly, even canon­i­cal­ly sur­re­al shape to mar­ket. But that hard­ly stopped Carti­er from putting out the Crash, whose dis­tort­ed shape may have always brought The Per­sis­tence of Mem­o­ry to mind, but whose name hints at the inspi­ra­tion of a watch smashed up in a car wreck. The Crash came out in swing­ing-six­ties Lon­don at its very height, by which time Dalí him­self had been design­ing real jew­el­ry for more than a quar­ter cen­tu­ry.\n\n\n\t\n\n?si=v8xd7w6Tr3ZQzIIq\nYou can see a few of Dalí’s jew­els in the 1960 British Pathé clip at the top of the post. Unsur­pris­ing­ly, they occu­py a realm apart from, or at least orthog­o­nal to, that of con­ven­tion­al jew­el­ry. Some of them move: Liv­ing Flower, for instance, which “opens to reveal sta­men and petals paved with dia­monds. The mech­a­nism is embed­ded in mala­chite from the Con­go, which to Dalí rep­re­sents the unknown, latent forces, while the gold and dia­mond flow­ers, known beau­ty and cre­ativ­i­ty.”\nAngel Cross, by con­trast, embod­ies “the hypox­i­o­log­i­cal con­cept of exis­tence — what­ev­er that means.”  Cer­tain­ly, Dalí nev­er claimed to play to the sen­si­bil­i­ty of the British, though some of them might go in for The Roy­al Heart, with its “pul­sat­ing rubies rep­re­sent­ing our queen, heart beat­ing con­stant­ly for her peo­ple, while the nugget gold sym­bol­izes the peo­ple shel­ter­ing and pro­tect­ing their ruler.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe seg­men­t’s out­takes fea­ture more footage of these pieces, giv­ing us a longer look at works like The Eye of Time, embed­ded with a small clock signed by Dalí, and the “leaf-veined hands” he described as “reach­ing out to the future.” Oth­er of his vivid jew­el­ry designs include the Medusa brooch, com­plet­ed with a nest of ruby-eyed gold snakes, and a con­struc­tion that lit­er­al­izes — and, at the same time, sur­re­al­izes — the expres­sion “ruby lips and teeth like pearls.” Real­ized in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the well-regard­ed jew­el­ers Car­los Ale­many, Eric Ert­man, and Hen­ryk Kas­ton, and often inspired by his wife and muse Gala, they may be over­shad­owed by Dalí’s paint­ings and draw­ings, but haute cou­ture does pay them occa­sion­al homage. What else — indeed, who else — could have inspired the throb­bing heart-shaped rhine­stone neck­lace seen on Schi­a­par­el­li’s mod­els last sum­mer at Paris Fash­ion Week?\nvia Messy Nessy\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nSal­vador Dalí’s Sur­re­al Cut­lery Set from 1957\nThe Tarot Card Deck Designed by Sal­vador Dalí\nWhen Sal­vador Dalí Cre­at­ed a Sur­re­al­ist Fun­house at New York World’s Fair (1939)\nWhat Makes Sal­vador Dalí’s Icon­ic Sur­re­al­ist Paint­ing “The Per­sis­tence of Mem­o­ry” a Great Work of Art\nCap­ti­vat­ing Col­lab­o­ra­tion: Artist Hubert Duprat Uses Insects to Cre­ate Gold­en Sculp­tures\nTake a Jour­ney Through 933 Paint­ings by Sal­vador Dalí & Watch His Sig­na­ture Sur­re­al­ism Emerge\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n            I joined Hyperallergic six years ago because I was drawn to its integrity and its commitment to tell stories that no other art publication would. And then I discovered the most rewarding part of working here — the freedom to speak my mind without fear. That’s not something to take for granted in a field plagued by bad-faith journalism and subservient, uncritical thinking. Now, as editor-in-chief of Hyperallergic, these values are my north star. This is my pledge: We will always speak our minds freely to meet the moment. We will stand for truth, justice, and equal rights for all. We will fight against tyranny, racism, misogyny, anti-LGBTQ+ hate, and elitism in the art world and beyond.We will hold art institutions and power players accountable.  We will champion art workers, art teachers and students, labor organizers, community activists, and marginalized groups — and help them be seen and heard. And we will always see art as a basic human right, not an investment asset for the ultra-wealthy. We’ve proven our commitment to these values for 16 years, sometimes at the cost of our bottom line. Help me lead Hyperallergic into this next chapter of its history. There’s still so much more to do and say. So much to fight for and against. I need you by my side. Please join as a member today!   Sincerely,Hakim BisharaEditor-in-Chief\n                  \n                      \n                        Membership\n                      \n                      \n                        Newsletter\n                      \n                  \n        ",

    "body": "\n    \n                Daily Newsletter\n                As writers and artists, we say the quiet part out loud, and we leave a record of our refusals and dreams. \n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Detail of Rose B. Simpson, \"Heights I, AP 2/2\" (2024) on the campus of the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico (photo courtesy Jason Ordaz)\n    \n        \n            Blue became my favorite color as soon as I laid eyes upon that most reproduced of artworks: Hokusai’s “The Great Wave off Kanagawa,” a framed poster of which still hangs in my grandmother’s room. Maybe you grew up with a print of this piece somewhere in your home, too.Over the last 12 months though, as blue as they’ve been, I find myself drawn more and more to the green that hooks my eye: the brushstrokes behind enthralled ballet dancers in British artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye’s “Harp-Strum” (2016), the shifting fabric in Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka’s 1931 “Young Woman in Green” and the candy paint of the Bugatti in her 1929 self-portrait, the phthalo green skin of Byron Kim’s ’90s Belly Painting series.But color is also an entrypoint — a way of changing how I see. Working with the many critics, artists, authors, and poets who have contributed to Hyperallergic this year, particularly our Opinion and Books sections, has required me to wipe my lens clean and reframe my thinking. That’s one of the gifts of editing; I love to learn and unlearn as I go along. And this year, I got to work on pieces that did what we in the arts are called to do — to respond and speak out. In New York City, artist Caitlin MacBride eulogized Kremer’s, a beloved and vital pigment shop that closed its physical storefront after three decades due, in part, to the Trump administration’s tariff policies. She describes how perusing its shelves became a meditative part of making art, grounding the process in tactility and sensation from the beginning.Among the excerpts we published, I was particularly proud to share essays drawn from Black in Blues by Imani Perry and Speculative Relations: Indigenous Worlding and Repair by Joseph M. Pierce (Cherokee). Perry writes unforgettably: “The same color could be a slur and a praise. Brown could be both luxurious and grotesque, and blue adornment could be garish or gorgeous.” What better year to read her words than this one, I wonder. Meanwhile, Pierce’s chapter begins with the bright red blanket in a haunting painting of Apache leader Geronimo, a reminder of the continuing fight for Indigenous sovereignty.In our Opinion section, artist Rose B. Simpson (Santa Clara Pueblo) took up this question in a moving statement in support of the Institute of American Indian Arts, a nexus of Native and Indigenous art of all kinds, after the Trump administration threatened its funding. Scholar Clementine Bordeaux (Sicangu Lakota Oyate) provided a true history of Mount Rushmore, first and still known as Six Grandfathers, that you won’t get from a park tour. “Our eyes are trained to see the four awful faces of settler violence,” she writes. “But I still see the Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe and all the non-human relatives that will continue to exist in the region beyond white supremacy.”\n\n                        Perhaps more than any other, this year in editing has only strengthened what artists and art writers do. We say the quiet part out loud, and we leave a record of our refusals and dreams. In 2026, Hyperallergic’s work of pushing our art worlds forward will be as important and vital as ever. Please consider supporting our work as a paying member — which, among other perks, enables you to comment on our articles. I hope you’ll consider joining the conversation and contributing in whatever way you can.

    "body": "\n            Happy last Saturday of the year. We've spent the past few weeks rounding up the best of the best of 2025 — our favorite exhibitions and artworks, the books and films that moved us, memes that made us laugh and helped us process an increasingly dystopian reality. We also published our annual 20 Most Powerless list, a Hyperallergic tradition dating back to our founding days that parodies the market-driven media's arbitrary “most powerful” rankings. Our first-ever Powerless list, published in 2009 (!), included “assistant curators living off $27,000 salaries,” and we're afraid not much has changed ... This year, we shout out undocumented immigrants, artists who've been censored, and other unsung heroes of the art world who are fighting for rights and recognition in spite of every effort to stop them.This week, we also remembered the artistic legends who left us this year. Artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, filmmaker David Lynch, architect Frank Gehry, and photographer Nona Faustine are among the giants who will remain with us in spirit and through their outsized imprint on the world. Each week, my colleague Associate Editor Lisa Yin Zhang’s In Memoriam column offers thoughtful tributes to artists we lost, part of Hyperallergic’s commitment to honoring legacies as we look ahead. Because art never sleeps, you’ll also find below our usual mix of criticism, news, community columns, and opinions: an art worker's letter to incoming NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Wes Anderson recreation of Joseph Cornell's studio in Paris, A View From the Easel, and lots more. Finally, please take a few seconds to read this personal message from our Editor-in-Chief Hakim Bishara to learn a little more about Hyperallergic’s work and why it matters so much that you support us in this moment. —Valentina Di Liscia, senior editorBest of 2025Undocumented immigrants, censored artists, and one famous Paris museum's security system are on our powerless list this year.

We’re all people deserving of love and respect and dignity. [...]What to do about this situation, I myself had not been sure. I was an adult and not especially “into” the series (as some adults are).

Pro-Palestine protesters jailed. Migrants disappeared from the streets of the United States. Trans individuals persecuted and denied life-saving care. Indigenous people's rights under threat.There was no shortage of injustices in 2025. Refusing to be desensitized by the perpetual scroll of tragic images and news headlines, artists and creative activists mobilized their mediums in pursuit of change, sometimes risking their own lives and livelihoods. Below are 10 works that spoke truth to power in 2025, a decidedly non-comprehensive list of murals, protest actions, museum exhibitions, and other artistic gestures to carry us with intention and courage into the new year.Banksy’s Mural in Support of Palestine ProtestersBanksy's September mural at the Royal Courts of Justice (screenshot Hyperallergic via @Banksy on Instagram)On September 8, two days after the mass arrests of 900 people who were protesting in support of Palestinian activists in London, Banksy revealed a chilling new mural on the exterior of the city's Royal Courts of Justice building. The elusive street artist's characteristically stenciled image — which was quickly covered up by authorities — depicted a court judge beating a protester with his gavel. It was an uncompromising denunciation of the British government's ban on the activist group Palestine Action, which was designated a “terrorist” organization in July. Ironically, Banksy's image is all the more powerful because it was scrubbed from the wall, leaving a haunting silhouette that became a protest artwork in its own right. An Aerial Photo of Migrants' Cry for HelpA drone view of detainees forming the letters SOS with their bodies in the courtyard at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, April 28, 2025 (© Reuters/Paul Ratje)Photojournalist Paul Ratje, who covers immigration and border issues on the ground from the US-Mexico border, captured this rare aerial image of imprisoned migrants spelling out the letters “SOS” from the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas. The mostly Venezuelan men held at Bluebonnet, labeled \"alien enemies\" with little or no evidence by the Trump administration, feared they could be deported to the infamous maximum security prison in El Salvador, CECOT. Ratje said journalists were not given access to the detention facility and he had little face-to-face contact with anyone in the town, making his experience of taking the photograph “surreal.”“Having this exchange with the detainees, albeit through the lens of my drone, was unexpected for me,” Ratje told Hyperallergic. “In my eyes, their decision to communicate with my drone was a clear indication of the urgency and anxiety they must have been feeling, under threat of being sent to CECOT with its brutal reputation.”\"Trans Forming Liberty\" by Amy SheraldA visitor with Amy Sherald's painting “Trans Forming Liberty\" (2024) at the Whitney Museum of American Art (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic) One of the defining images of 2025 is without a doubt Amy Sherald's “Trans Forming Liberty,” her portrait of a pink-haired Black trans woman, modeled after drag performer and musician Arewà Basit, dressed as the titular symbol of freedom and hope. Though painted in 2024, the artwork took on new significance this year, when Sherald canceled her planned exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in July over fears that the piece would be censored amid Trump's crackdown on the Smithsonian Institution. “When governments police museums, they are not simply policing exhibitions,” Sherald wrote in MSNBC’s opinion blog. “They are policing imagination itself.”Duane Linklater's Buffalo SculpturesA buffalo sculpture from the installation “wallowposition” in Duane Linklater: 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)Omaskêko Ininiwak (Cree) artist Duane Linklater explored the symbiotic relationship between Native people and buffalo in his poignant exhibition 12 + 2 at Dia Chelsea, anchored by seven wire and papier-mâché sculptures of the animals that are at once majestic and tender. Unlike the millions of buffalo killed by White settlers, part of a genocidal campaign to deny Indigenous people literal and spiritual sustenance, Linklater's bison roam free. They are deliberately rendered in various wallowing poses, like rolling in the dirt, which buffalo tend to assume when they feel comfortable, safe, and happy. In creating such an environment, Linklater gestures toward a future where Native life is neither contained nor threatened.A Climate Change Warning After LA FiresEddie Rodolfo Aparicio's painting at the California Common Good Rally (photo by Brooke Anderson, courtesy David Solnit)Victims of the Los Angeles fires rallied outside the Chevron oil refinery in Northern California in March, protesting the role of fossil fuels in creating the hot and dry conditions that we now know contributed to the spread of the blazes. At the center of that rally and another in Pasadena was a painting of a still-standing chimney emitting a thick cloud of black smoke, created by Eddie Rodolfo Aparicio along with David Solnit and dozens of volunteers. A call for action — “Invest in Communities, Not Fossil Fuels,” written in both English and Spanish — encircles the image, which draws on the metaphorical power of the chimneys that survived the fires. Aparicio, who lost his home in Altadena in the Eaton Fire, told Hyperallergic's LA Correspondent Matt Stromberg that he is “always looking at symbols that can hold both sides of an emotion: resilience and trauma.”The Drawing Protesters Refused to ForgetA sign at a No Kings protest in New York City (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)The drawing that President Trump reportedly gifted Jeffrey Epstein, part of a crude 50th birthday album for the convicted sex trafficker whose contents were made public earlier this year, spoke for itself. The sketch featured a cryptic imaginary conversation between the president and Epstein, typed within the outline of a woman’s body and signed “Trump” in place of her pubic hair. But a new version of the image quickly began circulating, one co-opted by concerned citizens demanding transparency and accountability. They replicated the now-infamous hourglass shape on protest placards and posters like the one above, captured by Hyperallergic co-founder and Editor-at-Large Hrag Vartanian at a “No Kings” protest in October. We resurface the damning visual amid the year-end release of a trove of new Epstein files, some containing serious allegations against Trump, and the promise of a million more to come.17,000 Children's Shoes for Gaza on Pennsylvania AvenueA shoe memorial organize by the New York City cultural advocacy organization the People’s Forum. April 5, 2025, in Washington, DC. (photo Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)In a devastating visual of the massacres committed by Israel in Gaza, the New York City-based group People’s Forum lined up approximately 17,000 pairs of kids' shoes — based on the number of Palestinian children killed between October 2023 and April 2025 — on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. Hyperallergic Staff Writer Isa Farfan captured the seemingly endless rows of tiny sandals and colorful sneakers arranged along the historic thoroughfare, a classic route of official government parades and protest marches. Israeli violence continued in Gaza despite a ceasefire agreement in October, reportedly killing hundreds of Palestinians since then. The Coming of the Lord by Fabián CháirezFábian Cháirez, \"La venida del señor\" (2018) (photo by Lalo Hermosilla Hanus/blok_studio_, courtesy the artist)Mexican artist Fabián Cháirez began creating his exquisitely painted portraits of queer priests and nuns in suggestive postures several years ago, but the works became a flashpoint of debates over artistic freedom in 2025. La venida del Señor (The coming of the Lord), Cháirez's solo exhibition at the Academia de San Carlos Centro Historico, which is affiliated with Mexico's national university, was censored in February after protests by Christian and right-wing groups. Cháirez told Hyperallergic that he perceived a “double standard” in the suppression of his works: \"I think there are other issues we should be protesting against, such as the church's abuse of power and sexual abuses within the church,\" he said.An Anti-Authoritarian Show Censored by ChinaDoc Tenzin, “Earth is Heard\" (2025) at the Bangkok Art & Culture Centre (photo courtesy the artist)An exhibition of works by artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and the Uyghur diaspora at the Bangkok Art & Culture Centre was heavily censored under pressure from Chinese authorities in August. Texts were blacked out, videos were turned off, and the flags of East Turkestan (Xinjiang) and Tibet were removed from the installation “Earth is Heard” (2025) by trans Tibetan artist Tenzin Mingyur Paldron (Doc Tenzin), among other alterations. The organizers of Constellation of Complicity: Visualising the Global Machinery of Authoritarian Solidarity, including an artist from Myanmar who reportedly fled the country in fear of persecution, said they opted to leave the show up with the covered artworks “as a statement itself.\"Nativities That Confront ICE’s CrueltyThe Nativity scene at St. Susanna Parish on December 3, 2025 (photo by Suzanne Kreiter/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)From the West Coast to the Vatican, the tradition of using Nativity scenes to convey humanitarian solidarity with migrants, displaced people, and oppressed communities is not new. The practice continued this year with particularly unflinching displays criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its record of violent aggression. One such example, the Nativity scene at St. Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, pictured above, came under attack by right-wing politicians for including a sign that read \"ICE WAS HERE\" in place of the Holy Family.Honorable Mention: The Statue of LibertyStreet artist Doug Groupp (aka Clown Soldier)'s “Attack on Liberty” graffiti (photo Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)She made appearances on protest signs and subway graffiti; on a mural in France and in marches at home, where demonstrators donned her gown, crown, and iconic torch to condemn the US government's abuses of power. From Amy Sherald's aforementioned portrait to politicians' calls for the sculpture's repatriation, Lady Liberty's remixes and resurgences reveal the public's hunger for art and symbols that rally communities and inspire action across time.\n                  \n                      \n                        Best of 2025\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

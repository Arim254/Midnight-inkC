    "body": "\n\tin Film, Technology |   \tJanuary 19th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen Net­flix launched around the turn of the mil­len­ni­um, it was received as a god­send by many Amer­i­can cinephiles, espe­cial­ly those who lived nowhere near diverse­ly pro­grammed revival hous­es or well-curat­ed video stores. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry lat­er, it’s safe to say that those days have come to an end. Not only does the stream­ing-only Net­flix of the twen­ty-twen­ties no longer trans­mit movies on DVD through the mail (a ser­vice its younger users have trou­ble even imag­in­ing), it ranks approx­i­mate­ly nowhere as a pre­ferred cinephile des­ti­na­tion. That has to do with a selec­tion much dimin­ished since the DVD days — espe­cial­ly as regards movies more than a decade or so old — but also with a brand debased by too many bland, for­mu­la­ic orig­i­nal pro­duc­tions.\nUnlike the plat­for­m’s var­i­ous acclaimed mul­ti-episode dra­mat­ic series, the “Net­flix movie” com­mands no crit­i­cal respect. But it can, at least if you trust the com­pa­ny’s own view­er­ship data, com­mand a large audi­ence, if not an espe­cial­ly atten­tive one. The gen­er­al semi-engage­ment of Net­flix view­ers, as argued in the Nerd­stal­gic video at the top of the post, is reflect­ed in the qual­i­ty of the “movie-shaped prod­uct” now served to them. \nFar from the slapped-togeth­er approx­i­ma­tions of Hol­ly­wood we once expect­ed from films made for TV, the stream-chart-top­ping likes of Red Notice and The Elec­tric State are mega-bud­get­ed pro­duc­tions brim­ming with big stars and large-scale visu­al effects. They’re also tis­sues of algo­rithm-approved nar­ra­tive ele­ments, bor­rowed imagery, and third-hand quips, all of them for­got­ten as soon as the next piece of con­tent begins auto-play­ing.\n\n\n\t\n\nOn the lat­est Joe Rogan Expe­ri­ence pod­cast, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon turned up to pro­mote their own Net­flix movie, The Rip. They don’t take long to open up about the dis­tinc­tive chal­lenges of work­ing for that plat­form in this era. Damon men­tions that, where­as action movies once saved their explo­sion-inten­sive set pieces for after the sto­ry gets in motion, Net­flix asks, “Can we get a big one in the first five min­utes? We want peo­ple to stay tuned in. And it wouldn’t be ter­ri­ble if you reit­er­at­ed the plot three or four times in the dia­logue because peo­ple are on their phones while they’re watch­ing.” Accord­ing to the film­mak­ers who speak about it, the needs of these so-called “sec­ond screen” view­ers have assumed great impor­tance in the stu­dio notes offered by Net­flix — which has, at this point, become a major stu­dio in itself.\n\n\n\t\n\nSat­is­fy­ing the appar­ent demands of Net­flix’s met­rics results in what Nerd­stal­gic calls “visu­al muzak,” geared to hold out just enough famil­iar­i­ty and pres­tige to get users to press play, with­out ever call­ing so much atten­tion to itself that they press stop. This makes the stu­dio pic­tures of the nineties, when Affleck and Damon broke out, look like the stuff of a gold­en age. “There were a lot of real­ly good inde­pen­dent movies that were being made,” Damon remem­bers. “They were mak­ing dar­ing movies, and every­one just got way more con­ser­v­a­tive.” On one lev­el, stream­ing plat­forms have great­ly widened access to film in gen­er­al; on anoth­er, they’ve sti­fled artis­tic indi­vid­u­al­i­ty and risk-tak­ing on the part of actu­al films. As Quentin Taran­ti­no has point­ed out, tech­nol­o­gy and eco­nom­ics put main­stream cin­e­ma into peri­ods of cre­ative retrench­ment every so often: the fifties, for exam­ple, or the eight­ies. Whether anoth­er sev­en­ties or nineties lies ahead, today’s cinephiles can only hope.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWho Is Killing Cin­e­ma?: A Mur­der Mys­tery Iden­ti­fies the Cul­tur­al & Eco­nom­ic Cul­prits\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Like Movies Any­more: The Rise of Meta­mod­ernist Films, and How They Grew Out of Mod­ernism & Post­mod­ernism\nHow the “Mar­veliza­tion” of Cin­e­ma Accel­er­ates the Decline of Film­mak­ing\nThe Decay of Cin­e­ma: Susan Son­tag, Mar­tin Scors­ese & Their Lamen­ta­tions on the Decline of Cin­e­ma Explored in a New Video Essay\nWhy We All Need Sub­ti­tles Now\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tJanuary 20th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nThe sto­ry, the many sto­ries, of Miles Davis as an open­ing act for sev­er­al rock bands in the 1970s makes for fas­ci­nat­ing read­ing. Before he blew the Grate­ful Dead’s minds as their open­ing act at the Fill­more West in April 1970 (hear both bands’ sets here), Davis and his all-star Quintet—billed as an “Extra Added Attraction”—did a cou­ple nights at the Fill­more East, open­ing for Neil Young and Crazy Horse and The Steve Miller Band in March of 1970. The com­bi­na­tion of Young and Davis actu­al­ly seems to have been rather unre­mark­able, but there is a lot to say about where the two artists were indi­vid­u­al­ly.\nNate Chi­nen in At Length describes their meet­ing as a “min­i­mum orbit inter­sec­tion distance”—the “clos­est point of con­tact between the paths of two orbit­ing sys­tems.” Both artists were “in the thrall of rein­ven­tion,” Young mov­ing away from the smooth­ness of CSNY and into free-form anti-vir­tu­os­i­ty with Crazy Horse; Davis toward vir­tu­os­i­ty turned back into the blues.\nMiles, sug­gest­ed jazz writer Greg Tate, was “bored fid­dling with quan­tum mechan­ics and just want­ed to play the blues again.” The sto­ry of Davis and Young at the Fill­more East is best told by lis­ten­ing to the music both were mak­ing at the time. Hear “Cin­na­mon Girl” below and the rest of Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s incred­i­ble set here. The band had just released their beau­ti­ful­ly ragged Every­body Knows this is Nowhere.\n\n\n\t\n\nWhen it comes to the meet­ing of Davis and Steve Miller, the sto­ry gets juici­er, and much more Miles: the dif­fi­cult per­former, not the impos­si­bly cool musi­cian. (It some­times seems like the word “dif­fi­cult” was invent­ed to describe Miles Davis.) The trum­peter’s well-earned ego­tism lends his lega­cy a kind of rak­ish charm, but I don’t rel­ish the posi­tions of those record com­pa­ny exec­u­tives and pro­mot­ers who had to wran­gle him, though many of them were less than charm­ing indi­vid­u­als them­selves. Colum­bia Records’ Clive Davis, who does not have a rep­u­ta­tion as a pushover, sounds alarmed in his rec­ol­lec­tion of Miles’ reac­tion after he forced the trum­peter to play the Fill­more dates to mar­ket psy­che­del­ic jazz-funk mas­ter­piece Bitch­es Brew to white audi­ences.\nAccord­ing to John Glatt, Davis remem­bers that Miles “went nuts. He told me he had no inter­est in play­ing for ‘those fu*king long-haired kids.’” Par­tic­u­lar­ly offend­ed by The Steve Miller Band, Davis refused to arrive on time to open for an artist he deemed “a sor­ry-ass cat,” forc­ing Miller to go on before him. “Steve Miller didn’t have his shit going for him,” remem­bers Davis in his exple­tive-filled auto­bi­og­ra­phy, “so I’m pissed because I got to open for this non-play­ing motherfu*ker just because he had one or two sor­ry-ass records out. So I would come late and he would have to go on first and then when we got there, we smoked the motherfu*king place, and every­body dug it.” There is no doubt Davis and Quin­tet smoked. Hear them do “Direc­tions” above from an Ear­ly Show on March 6, 1970.\n\n\n\t\n\n“Direc­tions,” from unre­leased tapes, is as raw as they come, “the inten­si­ty,” writes music blog Willard’s Worm­holes, “of a band that sounds like they were play­ing at The Fill­more to prove some­thing to some­body… and did.” The next night’s per­for­mances were released in 2001 as It’s About That Time. Hear the title track above from March 7th. You can also stream more on YouTube. As for The Steve Miller Blues Band? We have audio of their per­for­mance from that night as well. Hear it below. It’s inher­ent­ly an unfair com­par­i­son between the two bands, not least because of the vast dif­fer­ence in audio qual­i­ty. But as for whether or not they sound like “sor­ry-ass cats”… well, you decide.\n\n\n\t\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Night When Miles Davis Opened for the Grate­ful Dead in 1970: Hear the Com­plete Record­ings\nIn 1969 Telegram, Jimi Hen­drix Invites Paul McCart­ney to Join a Super Group with Miles Davis\nMiles Davis Plays Music from Kind of Blue Live in 1959, Intro­duc­ing a Com­plete­ly New Style of Jazz\nJer­ry Gar­cia Talks About the Birth of the Grate­ful Dead & Play­ing Kesey’s Acid Tests in New Ani­mat­ed Video\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nI have tak­en more out of alco­hol than alco­hol has tak­en out of me. — Win­ston Churchill\nWin­ston Churchill had a rep­u­ta­tion as a bril­liant states­man and a prodi­gious drinker.\nThe for­mer prime min­is­ter imbibed through­out the day, every day.  He also burned through 10 dai­ly cig­ars, and lived to the ripe old age of 90.\nHis come­back to Field Mar­shal Bernard Mont­gomery’s boast that he nei­ther smoked nor drank, and was 100 per­cent fit was “I drink and smoke, and I am 200 per­cent fit.”\nFirst Lady Eleanor Roo­sevelt mar­veled “that any­one could smoke so much and drink so much and keep per­fect­ly well.”\nIn No More Cham­pagne: Churchill and His Mon­ey, author David Lough doc­u­ments Churchill’s dis­as­trous alco­hol expens­es, as well as the bot­tle count at Chartwell, his Ken­tish res­i­dence. Here’s the tal­ly for March 24,1937:\n180 bot­tles and 30 half bot­tles of Pol Roger cham­pagne\n20 bot­tles and 9 half bot­tles of oth­er cham­pagne\n100+ bot­tles of claret\n117 bot­tles and 389 half bot­tles of Barsac\n13 bot­tles of brandy\n5 bot­tles of cham­pagne brandy\n7 bot­tles of liqueur whisky\n\nAll that liquor was not going to drink itself.\nDid Churchill have a hol­low leg?  An extra­or­di­nar­i­ly high tol­er­ance? An uncan­ny abil­i­ty to mask his intox­i­ca­tion?\nWhiskey som­me­li­er Rex Williams, a founder of the Whiskey Tribe YouTube chan­nel, and pod­cast host Andrew Heaton endeav­or to find out, above, by ded­i­cat­ing a day to the British Bulldog’s drink­ing reg­i­men.\nThey’re not the first to under­take such a fol­ly.\nThe Dai­ly Telegraph’s Har­ry Wal­lop doc­u­ment­ed a sim­i­lar adven­ture in 2015, wind­ing up queasy, and to judge by his 200 spelling mis­takes, cog­ni­tive­ly impaired.\nWilliams and Heaton’s on-cam­era exper­i­ment achieves a Drunk His­to­ry vibe and tell­tale flushed cheeks.\nHere’s the drill, not that we advise try­ing it at home:\nBREAKFAST\nAn eye open­er of John­nie Walk­er Red — just a splash — mixed with soda water to the rim.\nFol­low with more of the same through­out the morn­ing.\nThis is how Churchill, who often con­duct­ed his morn­ing busi­ness abed in a dress­ing gown, man­aged to aver­age between 1 — 3 ounces of alco­hol before lunch.\nAppar­ent­ly he devel­oped a taste for it as a young sol­dier post­ed in what is now Pak­istan, when Scotch not only improved the fla­vor of plain water, ‘once one got the knack of it, the very repul­sion from the fla­vor devel­oped an attrac­tion of its own.”\nAfter a morn­ing spent sip­ping the stuff, Heaton reports feel­ing “play­ful and jokey, but not yet vio­lent.”\nLUNCH\nTime for “an ambi­tious quo­ta of cham­pagne!”\nChurchill’s pre­ferred brand was Pol Roger, though he wasn’t averse to Giesler, Moet et Chan­don, or Pom­mery,  pur­chased from the upscale wine and spir­its mer­chant Ran­dolph Payne & Sons,  whose let­ter­head iden­ti­fied them as sup­pli­ers to “Her Majesty The Late Queen Vic­to­ria and to The Late King William The Fourth.”\nChurchill enjoyed his impe­r­i­al pint of cham­pagne from a sil­ver tankard, like a “prop­er Edwar­dian gent” accord­ing to his life­long friend, Odette Pol-Roger.\nWilliams and Heaton take theirs in flutes accom­pa­nied by fish sticks from the freez­er case. This is the point beyond which a hang­over is all but assured.\nLunch con­cludes with a post-pran­di­al cognac, to set­tle the stom­ach and begin the diges­tion process.\nChurchill, who declared him­self a man of sim­ple tastes — I am eas­i­ly sat­is­fied with the best — would have insist­ed on some­thing from the house of Hine.\nRESTORATIVE  AFTERNOON NAP\nThis seems to be a crit­i­cal ele­ment of Churchill’s alco­hol man­age­ment suc­cess. He fre­quent­ly allowed him­self as much as 90 min­utes to clear the cob­webs.\nA nap def­i­nite­ly pulls our re-enac­tors out of their tail spins. Heaton emerges ready to “bluff (his) way through a meet­ing.”\nTEATIME\nI guess we can call it that, giv­en the tim­ing.\nNo tea though.\nJust a steady stream of extreme­ly weak scotch and sodas to take the edge off of admin­is­tra­tive tasks.\nDINNER\nMore cham­pagne!!! More cognac!!!\n“This should be the apex of our wit,” a bleary Heaton tells his belch­ing com­pan­ion, who fess­es up to vom­it­ing upon wak­ing the next day.\nTheir con­clu­sion? Churchill’s reg­i­men is unmanageable…at least for them.\nAnd pos­si­bly also for Churchill.\nAs fel­low Scotch enthu­si­ast Christo­pher Hitchens revealed in a 2002 arti­cle in The Atlantic, some of Churchill’s most famous radio broad­casts, includ­ing his famous pledge to “fight on the beach­es” after the Mir­a­cle of Dunkirk, were voiced by a pinch hit­ter:\nNor­man Shel­ley, who played Win­nie-the-Pooh for the BBC’s Children’s Hour, ven­tril­o­quized Churchill for his­to­ry and fooled mil­lions of lis­ten­ers. Per­haps Churchill was too much inca­pac­i­tat­ed by drink to deliv­er the speech­es him­self.\nOr per­haps the great man mere­ly felt he’d earned the right to unwind with a glass of Graham’s Vin­tage Char­ac­ter Port, a Fine Old Amon­til­la­do Sher­ry or a Fine Old Liquor brandy, as was his wont.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nWin­ston Churchill Gets a Doctor’s Note to Drink Unlim­it­ed Alco­hol While Vis­it­ing the U.S. Dur­ing Pro­hi­bi­tion (1932)\nWin­ston Churchill’s Paint­ings: Great States­man, Sur­pris­ing­ly Good Artist\nOh My God!

    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tJanuary 20th, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough it’s eas­i­ly for­got­ten in our age of air trav­el and instan­ta­neous glob­al com­mu­ni­ca­tion, many a great city is locat­ed where it is because of a riv­er. That holds true every­where from Lon­don to Buenos Aires to Tokyo to New York — and even to Los Ange­les, despite its own once-uncon­trol­lable riv­er hav­ing long since been turned into a much-ridiculed con­crete drainage chan­nel. But no urban water­way has been quite so roman­ti­cized for quite so long as the Seine, which runs through the mid­dle of Paris. And it was in the mid­dle of the Seine, on the now-apt­ly named Île de la Cité, that Paris began. In the 3D time-lapse video above, you can wit­ness the near­ly two-and-a-half-mil­len­ni­um evo­lu­tion of that tiny set­tle­ment into the cap­i­tal we know today in just three min­utes.\nParis did­n’t take its shape in a sim­ple process of out­ward growth. As is vis­i­ble from high above through the video’s ani­ma­tion, the city has grown dif­fer­ent­ly in each era of its exis­tence, whether it be that of the Parisii, the tribe from whom it takes its name; of the Roman Empire, which con­struct­ed the stan­dard Car­do Max­imus (now known as the Rue Saint-Jacques) and Decumanus Max­imus, among much oth­er infra­struc­ture; the Mid­dle Ages, amid whose great (and hap­haz­ard) den­si­fi­ca­tion rose Notre-Dame de Paris; or the time of Baron Hauss­mann, whose rad­i­cal urban ren­o­va­tions laid waste to great swathes of medieval Paris and replaced them with the broad avenues, state­ly res­i­den­tial build­ings, and grand mon­u­ments rec­og­nized around the world today.\nAt first glance, the built envi­ron­ment of mod­ern Paris can seem to have been frozen in Hauss­man­n’s mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry — and no doubt, that’s just the way its count­less many tourists might want it. But as shown in the video, the Ville Lumière has kept chang­ing through­out the indus­tri­al era, and has­n’t stopped in the suc­ceed­ing “glob­al­iza­tion era.” More growth and trans­for­ma­tion has late­ly tak­en place out­side cen­tral Paris, beyond the encir­cling Boule­vard Périphérique, but it would hard­ly do jus­tice to his­to­ry to ignore such more rel­a­tive­ly recent, more divi­sive addi­tions as the Tour Mont­par­nasse, the Cen­tre Pom­pi­dou, or the Lou­vre Pyra­mid. (When it was built in the eigh­teen-eight­ies, even the beloved Eif­fel Tow­er drew a great deal of ire and dis­dain.) And though the ven­er­a­ble Notre-Dame may have stood on Île de la Cité since the four­teenth cen­tu­ry, the thor­ough­go­ing recon­struc­tion that fol­lowed its 2019 fire has made it belong just as much to the twen­ty-first. \nvia Kot­tke\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nA 3D Ani­mat­ed His­to­ry of Paris: Take a Visu­al Jour­ney from Ancient Times to 1900\nHow Paris Became Paris: The Sto­ry Behind Its Icon­ic Squares, Bridges, Mon­u­ments & Boule­vards\nA 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals What Paris Looked Like When It Was a Roman Town\nTake an Aer­i­al Tour of Medieval Paris\nThe Archi­tec­tur­al His­to­ry of the Lou­vre: 800 Years in Three Min­utes\nAn Ani­mat­ed His­to­ry of Ver­sailles: Six Min­utes of Ani­ma­tion Show the Con­struc­tion of the Grand Palace Over 400 Years\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

One part of a trilogy called Earth, comprising similar renditions of glowing orbs within scaffolding, “Divided” splits the sphere in half. Two identical sides sit within their own frameworks, open down the center so that visitors can immerse themselves in the illuminated corridor. SpY’s urban interventions pop up in warehouses and along city promenades in cities around the world. See more on his Instagram.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

On view in Fairfield, Connecticut, from January 23 through July 25, the exhibition opens with Childe Hassam’s “Italian Day, May 1918” — lent by Art Bridges — and concludes with a textile sculpture newly commissioned from Maria de Los Angeles. Emma Amos, Eric Fischl, Jane Hammond, and Glenn Ligon are among the many other artists whose work is represented.“This exhibition is an opportunity for all of us to examine the narratives that have shaped our country, particularly those that have been overlooked or challenged,” said Carey Mack Weber, executive director of the Fairfield University Art Museum and exhibition curator. “Through these artworks, we invite visitors to engage deeply with the pressing issues of justice, representation, and unity — issues that are as relevant today as they were when our nation was founded.”This show aligns with the guiding themes from Connecticut’s CT 250 initiative, especially those of “telling inclusive stories” and “for the common good.” As the CT 250 guidelines state, “For much of our history, the United States has excluded people — women, free and enslaved African Americans, Indigenous people, immigrants, people with disabilities, the poor, and many others — from full participation and representation in the nation’s political, economic, and cultural life. This commemoration is an opportunity to continue the nation’s reckoning with the past, both its glory and its missteps and flaws. By telling previously untold stories, we will enable everyone to find a place in our nation’s narrative.”A robust selection of programming has been developed to complement this exhibition, including gallery talks with artists whose work is included in the show, lectures on topics ranging from artist Florine Stettheimer’s passion for Americana to a deep dive into Stanley Forman’s photograph “The Soiling of Old Glory”, and family-friendly events centered around flag-making and other topics. All programs are free and open to the public. This exhibition is part of a series of cultural and artistic events at Fairfield University commemorating the semiquincentennial of the United States.To learn more, visit fairfield.edu. \n                  \n                      \n                        Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Sponsored\n                      \n                      \n                        Exhibition Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Connecticut\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Cathy Yan (all images courtesy the Sundance Film Festival)\n    \n        \n            Across nearly five decades, the Sundance Film Festival has evolved from a small showcase for independent film into one of the premier festivals in the United States and a linchpin of the business. In the process, it has departed from its indie roots, much as independent filmmaking in the US has been absorbed into the mainstream. Art-related films in particular reflect the festival’s changes, running the gamut from niche subjects to crowd pleasers. Case in point, one of the buzziest entries in this year’s program is The Moment, an autofictional mockumentary starring pop star Charli xcx.Musician Courtney Love gets a more traditional biographical treatment in Antiheroine, which follows her through the recording of her latest album and looks back on her career, most pointedly her relationship with Kurt Cobain. Broken English employs a more oblique approach in its portrait of the recently deceased actress and singer Marianne Faithfull. Interviews with Faithfull and archival materials are framed by segments in which actors Tilda Swinton and George MacKay play researchers for the “Ministry of Not Forgetting” who are investigating her life. Still from Barbara Forever, dir. Brydie O’ConnorOn the other end of the spectrum are documentaries about less prominent (though no less important) artists. Barbara Forever draws on the astonishingly rich personal archive and many  experimental films of the pioneering queer director Barbara Hammer to assemble a deeply personal and affecting biography. The highest compliment I can pay is that it feels of a piece with Hammer’s films. Some of the artist’s contemporaries either worked on or appeared in programming for Manhattan Cable Television, a taboo-busting public access channel that broadcast from 1976 to 1990. Public Access looks back at this anarchic venture into experimental television, which included The Emerald City, one of the earliest series by and for the queer community. An even greater feat of archival resurrection comes in the form of Once Upon a Time in Harlem, which captures a party staged in 1972 by filmmaker William Greaves for surviving artists of the Harlem Renaissance. The footage lay fallow for decades before the film was recently completed by Greaves’s son, David. We are now as far removed from this event as it was from the Harlem Renaissance itself. The result is a poignant, multilayered reckoning with history.Still from Once Upon a Time in Harlem, dir. William Greaves and David GreavesThe broader art world and its institutions are the subjects of the fiction feature The Gallerist. The film stars Natalie Portman as a gallery owner so desperate for exposure and success that she tries to sell a corpse as a piece at Art Basel Miami, satirizing the culture and commerce of art fairs. The documentary short The Oligarch and the Art Dealer chronicles the Bouvier affair, in which the relationship between art dealer Yves Bouvier and Russian magnate Dmitry Rybolovlev soured as the former faced various accusations of fraud, forgery, and money laundering. Finally, the callous treatment of Indigenous artifacts and remains by museums is scrutinized in Aanikoobijigan [ancestor/great-grandparent/great-grandchild], the latest film from Adam and Zack Khalil. They follow the Michigan Anishinaabek Cultural Preservation and Repatriation Alliance by imagining its work as a vector through which ancestors’ spirits free their bodies and belongings from institutions holding them captive. Whatever form the festival takes as it shifts cities next year and continues to change, I hope the experimental ethos of films like this one persists.Still from The Oligarch and the Art Dealer, dir.

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tNovember 28th, 2025  31 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs hard as it may be to believe, some of us have nev­er seen a movie belong­ing to the Mar­vel Cin­e­mat­ic Uni­verse. If you’re one of those unini­ti­at­ed, none of the count­less clips incor­po­rat­ed into the Like Sto­ries of Old video essay above will tempt you to get ini­ti­at­ed. Nor will the laments aired by host Tom van der Lin­den, who, despite once enjoy­ing the MCU him­self, even­tu­al­ly came to won­der why keep­ing up with its releas­es had begun to feel less like a thrill than a chore. As if their CGI-laden sound and fury weren’t try­ing enough, there’s also “the con­stant quip­ping, the annoy­ing self-aware­ness, the fact that every­thing has to be a fran­chise now.”\nVan der Lin­den labels a cen­tral fac­tor in the decline of the MCU “sto­ry­telling entropy.” Clas­sic films, you may have noticed, con­cen­trate prac­ti­cal­ly all the ener­gy in every facet of their pro­duc­tion toward the expres­sion of spe­cif­ic themes, sto­ries, and char­ac­ters; at their best, their every line, ges­ture, cut, and inven­tion rep­re­sents the tip of an artis­tic ice­berg. Take, to use a pop­u­lar exam­ple, the lightsaber intro­duced in Star Wars, which Van der Lin­den calls “not just a weapon, but a metaphor” that “sym­bol­i­cal­ly com­mu­ni­cates a lot about the phi­los­o­phy of its wield­er, and about the larg­er world that it exists in,” con­dens­ing “a mul­ti­tude of mean­ings and ideas into a sim­ple, sin­gu­lar object.”\nIt does so in the first two or three movies, at any rate. In the decades since, as the Star Wars uni­verse has grown ever vaster, more com­plex, and con­cep­tu­al­ly unwieldy, so the pro­lif­er­a­tion and mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the once-mar­velous lightsaber has turned it into some­thing mun­dane, even banal. So it goes with sto­ry­telling entropy, a phe­nom­e­non that afflicts every nar­ra­tive fran­chise com­mer­cial­ly com­pelled to grow with­out end. That process of expan­sion even­tu­al­ly turns even the most cap­ti­vat­ing orig­i­nal mate­ri­als dif­fuse and unin­volv­ing to all but the hard­est-core fans — by which point it has usu­al­ly become obvi­ous that cre­ators them­selves have long since lost their own pas­sion for the sto­ries.\nMost MCU view­ers will admit that it has pro­duced miss­es as well as hits. But Mar­veliza­tion, as Van der Lin­den calls it, has also inspired oth­er, imi­ta­tive cor­po­rate fran­chis­es to pump out glob­al­ly mar­ketable con­tent fierce­ly pro­tect­ed by intel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty lawyers — and has even drained the inter­est out of realms of film and tele­vi­sion that have noth­ing to do with super­heroes, swords, or sci-fi. Hol­ly­wood has always been about the bot­tom line, of course, but only in recent decades have mar­ket sat­u­ra­tion, cross-plat­form strat­e­gy, and max­i­mum crossover poten­tial come to dom­i­nate its pri­or­i­ties so com­plete­ly. From the MCU or oth­er­wise, a Mar­velized movie is one that, at bot­tom, has no press­ing need to be made — and that we, ulti­mate­ly, feel no press­ing need to see.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Real Any­more: A Close Look at Chang­ing Film­mak­ing Tech­niques\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom a variety of natural colors of clay, Léonore Chastagner sculpts tender representations of the human form. She details the wrinkles on one’s knuckles, the creases in a pair of denim jeans, and the intricate layers of a loosely folded T-shirt. \n“I use clay as one uses a diary: to record the feelings of daily life and the things that surround me,” Chastagner tells Colossal. “I take interest in what’s in front of me when I’m alone: my apartment, clothes, small gestures of the body.”\nUntitled (2022), ceramic, 51 x 65 x 45 centimeters. Photo by jclett\nChastagner’s background in art history also influences her work, especially through the lens of archaeology and the often mysterious origins or uses of small figurines or personal objects. She’s particularly interested in the kinds of talismans and goods that were buried with the deceased in order to accompany the soul to the afterlife—a ritual seen in myriad ancient cultures around the globe.\nClay is itself a timeless and inherently malleable medium, which Chastagner appreciates for the range of techniques and consistencies she can work with. Because the material is soft and immediately responsive to touch, it represents a kind of freedom and openness. “I was also drawn to (clay’s) simplicity,” the artist says. “It’s a natural material that’s been used by human beings since the earliest civilisations. It has a universal quality.”\nRecently, Chastagner has been working on a series of domestic environments, such as small bedrooms and living rooms. These move beyond objects or figurative gestures to consider the spaces that encompass the body and evoke a sense of nostalgia for miniatures, like dollhouses.\nThe artist’s work will be on view in a solo presentation during Ceramic Brussels, which runs January 21 to 25, and celebrates her win of the fair’s juried Art Prize last year. Chastagner is also working toward solo exhibitions opening in April at Centrale in Brussels and in May at Galerie Anne-Sarah Bénichou in Paris.

The art market media declared a once-again \"healthy\" market reemerging from a protracted slump. \"The entire week becomes a choreographed attempt to convince the world that everything is fine, that the market is strong, that the system still works,\" writes artist Damien Davis in our top piece this week. \"But everything is not fine. And most of the people making the work that keeps this machine running know it.\" While Davis writes from the perspective of the 99% of artists who don't partake in this blue-chip carnival, Marc Straus writes as a veteran art dealer who's been around the auction block many times. In an eye-opening essay, he explains why the market is in a much worse shape than many realize, citing the closure of at least 60 art galleries in recent years.Meanwhile, the world keeps turning, and another Thanksgiving came upon us in the United States. This year, amid high levels of political and social unease, we decided to put together a feel-good list of all the things we're grateful for in the art world. It ranges from thoughtful rehangs and no-strings-attached grants to gallery dogs and desserts at a specific museum cafe. Enjoy it.

    "body": "\n\tSotheby’s has unveiled the full contents of its Old Master and 19th century evening sale, slated for December 3 in London, saying the works are defined by “exceptional and scholarly significance and rare discoveries.” Of the 31 works, half have been hidden from public view for more than a century, while 12 have not been seen on the secondary market in 40 years. The house said the auction is one of the “greatest assemblages of Old Masters presented at Sotheby’s London in the last six years.”Among the top lots are Hans Eworth’s Portrait of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk (1652), which is making its auction debut with a high estimate of £3 million. The house said it “offers a striking glimpse into the artistry and political intrigue of the Tudor court.” The Census at Bethlehem (1566) by Pieter Brueghel the Younger will also hit the auction block with a high estimate of £5 million, as well as the rediscovered Peter Paul Rubens oil sketch, The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne adored by Saints of the House of Habsburg (high estimate: £3 million). A £7 million high estimate has been slapped on Rembrandt’s portrait of Saint John on Patmos.“This is such a special season, defined by truly great works,” Elisabeth Lobkowicz, Sotheby’s head of department and evening sale, Old Master paintings, told ARTnews. “In many instances the importance of these paintings has only recently been recognised, thanks to the enormous amount of research my colleagues have done, working—in some instances for months, even years—with outside scholars to shed new light on their authorship and history. The galleries look stunning, filled with an array of beautiful paintings, each with a fascinating story to tell. They are already working their magic on art lovers from across the globe, and we hope everyone can come into the galleries and experience these paintings firsthand. It’s an auction not to be missed.”The sale will also feature works from the collection of Dr Hinrich Bischoff. They include Lucas van Valckenborch’s Autumn: Landscape with Archduke Matthias of Austria with members of his court at the Vintage (1597)—high estimate: £800,000—and the artist’s The Crucifixion of Christ on Mount Calvary (1568), which has a high estimate of £400,000.The works went on public view at Sotheby’s on New Bond Street on Friday.\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n",

    "body": "\n\tChristie’s London is preparing to send another trove of works amassed by the late Sam Josefowitz to the auction block on December 3. Titled “The Sam Josefowitz Collection: Graphic Masterpieces by Rembrandt van Rijn – Part III,” it follows the sales of Part I and Part II over the last two years, which netted the house a combined £13.5 million.This time around, 101 prints by the Dutch master will be up for grabs during Christie’s Classic Week. “Rembrandt’s etchings were an enduring passion for the late Sam Josefowitz, whose collection of the Dutch master’s graphic works remains unparalleled by any other 20th-century collector,” the house said in a statement. “This sale presents the final opportunity to acquire some of the rarest and most moving graphic works by Rembrandt.”Among the top lots going under the hammer next month are a portrait titled Arnout Tholinx, Inspector (circa 1656), which has a high estimate of £2.5 million. “This print has always been considered a great rarity, and this is the last impression in private hands,” Tim Schmelcher, a prints and multiples specialist at Christie’s London, told ARTnews. “Twelve impressions of this work were made in total, and this is the only version not in a public collection. It is arguably the most beautiful, or at least on par with the one in the British Museum. There is also another impression in the Rothschild collection at the Louvre in Paris. The one we are selling has for centuries been considered one of the unicorns of print collecting because it is so rare. It’s also serendipitous that this particular sheet was offered exactly 101 years ago at Christie’s, given there are 101 lots in the sale. That was the last time this subject appeared in public.”The current record for a Rembrandt print at auction is held by Christ presented to the people (“Ecce Homo”), sold at Christie’s London in 2018 for £2,648,750.Josefowitz was originally from Lithuania and traveled to the US in the 1930s to study industrial engineering. He and his brother David set up the Concert Hall Society, a mail-order subscription club that sold records, vitamins, and books, a business model that predated Jeff Bezos’ early Amazon iteration by half a century. The booming business furnished Josefowitz with an impressive art collection spanning late-19th-century symbolism and the Pont-Aven School to Diego Giacometti furniture and prints. Much of the work was sold before he died, with 17 paintings and 84 prints going to the Indianapolis Museum of Art for a reported $30 million. A year after his death in 2015, Christie’s Paris sold 35 works for €2.7 million.“Christie’s last Old Masters print sale, which was in March and online, totaled £3.6 million and sold 94 percent by lot, showing that this category is very healthy. Schmelcher told ARTnews when asked about the health of the Old Masters print market. He added that “traditional, specialized collectors” are bidding on these prints, alongside buyers with “more eclectic collecting habits.”Christie’s tested demand for Rembrandt prints in October, when it sold the first part of Klaus Hegewisch’s collection, including the Dutch master’s etching and drypoint, The Three Trees (1643). It sold for £825,500, almost three times its high estimate and the auction’s second-highest price. On the night, Albrecht Dürer’s Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513) also realized £304,800 (high estimate: £120,000) and his Adam and Eve (1504) took £279,400 (high estimate: £180,000). The auction totaled £8,935,720. The print category has been a rare bright spot in the art market over the last couple of years. According to the most recent Art Basel and UBS report, spending on prints and multiples, most of which are priced under $50,000, saw a 3 percent rise, reaching a market share of 7 percent. Prints also now account for a quarter of high net worth collectors’ holdings, marking an increase of 16 percent on 2023.\n",

    "body": "\n\tEven the estate of an artist as acclaimed as Romare Bearden has trouble tracking down the thousands of works he made over the course of his five-decade career. Known as one of America’s foremost collagists, Bearden created a distinctive style that can often be easily recognizable, but tracking down every single work he made, including ones not in that mode, can be a difficult task, especially when it comes to compiling a catalogue raisonné for the artist. \n\n\tThough the support of a gallery is helpful in keeping track of an artwork’s provenance, artists aren’t always thinking about their legacy the way a gallerist would. “Bearden was a social worker, and by virtue of just his way of life, he was giving things away to friends of his who were outside of the art world. And so, these things weren’t necessarily being documented as transactions,” said Elizabeth Gorayeb, the director of the Wildenstein Plattner Institute (WPI), which is publishing a catalogue raisonné for Bearden with the late artist’s namesake foundation.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tBut, the Bearden Foundation has managed to ascribe 2,400 artworks to him, and approximately 800 more were identified by the WPI team that is compiling his catalogue raisonné. Of these 3,000 works, 210 of them form the basis of the first chapter of The Romare Bearden Catalogue Raisonné Project, an in-progress compendium of all the known works by the 20th-century artist and only the second catalogue raisonné for an African American artist to ever be compiled.\n\n\tAs part of the research process, the Bearden Foundation digitized the artist’s archive of ephemera, which included exhibition announcements, catalogs, and other printed things that he sent out. Excavating this archive resulted in new discoveries, like a portrait by Bearden of artist Edmonia Lewis, who achieved fame during the late 19th-century, a rarity for a Black and Native American woman artist at the time. The portrait was featured on a 1969 greeting card published Harris Graphics, for which he also produced other greeting cards. Bearden’s original portrait of Lewis, however, still remains at large.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA screenshot of WPI’s The Romare Bearden Catalogue Raisonné Project digital interface. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy WPI\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe partnership with WPI to publish the Bearden catalogue raisonné began in earnest in 2017 when Bearden Foundation codirector Diedra Harris-Kelley attended a talk for WPI’s release of a Jasper Johns catalogue raisonné, where she met Gorayeb. But a significant portion of the research had already been ongoing for nearly three decades, since the foundation’s formation in 1990, two years after the artist’s death.\n\n\n\t“For 30 years, we’ve been collecting information,” Harris-Kelley told ARTnews. “We knew that a catalogue raisonné was something we wanted to end up with eventually because this was something all artists need to have—and Bearden had not had one.”\n\n\tWhat attracted the Bearden Foundation to work with WPI was its emphasis on producing digital catalogue raisonnés, a rising trend in the field. For the most part, WPI has focused on the work of 19th-century artists, including Monet, Degas, Gauguin, and Renoir. The only other 20th-century artists it has conducted research for are Jasper Johns and Tom Wesselmann. The first installment of The Romare Bearden Catalogue Raisonné Project, initially published in June, accounts for the artist’s output between 1964 and 1969, considered his most recognizable period.  \n\n\tBefore undertaking this publication, Harris-Kelley knew the project wouldn’t be easy, estimating it would take at least 10 years to complete. In the past four years, the catalogue raisonné has completed the research for these five important years, while also simultaneously conducting research on earlier and later periods. Even still, there is much more work to be done. “Bearden was a prolific artist. We know of artworks that were in exhibitions that we don’t have images for—about 800 works that we just have titles but no images for,” she said. And so the research continues.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRomare Bearden, Prevalence of Ritual: Tidings, 1964.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Romare Bearden Foundation, Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY/Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh\n\t\n\n\n\n\tBorn in 1911 in Charlotte, North Carolina, Bearden was raised in New York and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After completing a degree in education in 1935 from New York University, he became a case worker for the New York City Department of Social Services. Around this time, he began taking classes at the Art Students League, under the direction of German Expressionist George Grosz. After serving in the US Army during World II, Bearden returned to Europe in 1950, using the GI Bill to study art history at the Sorbonne and philosophy with Gaston Bachelard. He returned to the US in 1951and continued working in a non-representational abstract mode, similar to what he witnessed in Europe at the time. \n\n\tWhen he turned away from abstraction to his earliest collage work—initially using a Photostat machine—in the 1960s, Bearden “recast canonical themes in Western art—genre scenes, devotional imagery, history paintings, portraits—with Black figures,” art historians Jacqueline Francis and Anne Mohan write in the catalogue raisonné. “The result merges references to contemporary Black life, African art, and Black folk traditions in ways that simultaneously redress an enduring representational lacuna in art history, index the richness and diversity of Black culture and experience, and refute the myth of a unitary Black subject.”\n\n\tBeginning in 1964, Bearden started making his now iconic collages, which were featured on the covers of Time, Fortune, and New York magazines. “This period of 1964 to 1969,” Gorayeb said, “is really when he became the Bearden that we know.” That pivotal moment in his career is discussed at length in an accompanying essay penned by Monahan and Francis, a Bearden expert who served as a coeditor on a 2011 monograph on the artist.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRomare Bearden, Sermons: The Walls of Jericho, 1964.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Romare Bearden Foundation, Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY/Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe first catalogue raisonné was published in France in 1751, the year after the death of its author, art dealer Edme-François Gersaint. Its title, Catalogue raisonné de toutes les pieces qui forment l’oeuvre de Rembrandt, literally translates to “reasoned catalogue of the pieces that form the collective works of Rembrandt,” and its objective was just that: to provide a full accounting of the works that could be attributed, without a doubt, to Rembrandt—and put to rest centuries of debate. The volume’s 1952 English translation includes “considerable additions and improvements” (per its new title), by Pierre Charles Alexandre Helle and Jean-Baptiste Glomy, such as describing the artworks in words. And thus the modern catalogue raisonné was born.\n\n\tToday, catalogues raisonnés are just as valuable as sources of scholarship as they are in aiding market transactions for the works included. The producers of catalogues raisonnés often avoid trying to “authenticate” an artwork to avoid lawsuits and litigious collectors, though inclusion in a catalogue raisonné does offer potential buyers a certain ease of legitimacy of a given work.  In the case of the discovery and verification of the missing Bearden collages, WPI’s Gorayeb said, “We’re not authenticating anything. We’re giving an opinion, and we reserve the right to tell them that we will include it or we won’t include it, and basically it indemnifies us in case they’re not happy with our opinion.”\n\n\tBecause of their costs, catalogues raisonnés are typically produced and funded by dealers who have a stake in an artist’s market, whether via official representation of the estate or being a well-regarded purveyor of the artist’s works on the secondary market. The role of an artist’s gallery also helps with the research as they typically know to whom they originally sold the work and likely who owns it today. The publisher of a catalogue raisonné, whether it be a gallery, estate, or independent entity, often gives them a certain amount of authority in the artist’s secondary market.\n\n\tThe Bearden Foundation and WPI are operating mostly independent of galleries who trade in Bearden’s art. “Some galleries are very protective of their clients,” Harris-Kelley told ARTnews about the estate’s ongoing research. “They don’t want to give out addresses. They don’t want you to go and photograph the work. They don’t know what condition the work is in. That’s the other thing—you go to photograph something and it doesn’t look like you thought it was going to look.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRomare Bearden, Spring Way, 1964.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Romare Bearden Foundation, Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY/Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C.\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe only other African American artist to have a catalogue raisonné is Jacob Lawrence. Published in 2000, the year of his death, Lawrence worked with the project’s coeditors, Peter T. Nesbett and Michelle DuBois, to help them compile a compendium of over 900 of the artist’s paintings, drawings, and murals completed between 1935 and 1999, including his iconic 60-panel work, The Migration Series (1940–41).\n\n\t“The challenging part was the huge undertaking,” Nesbett said of compiling the catalogue raisonné pre-internet and without a PhD. “There’s a long-term commitment that requires steadfastness, perseverance, but also not everybody wants you to do it.” To complete it, the nonprofit Jacob Lawrence Catalogue Raisonné Project had to raise $1.3 million, with some funds coming from the sale of $2,500 prints Lawrence created specifically for the project.\n\n\tOne challenge facing compiling the Bearden catalogue raisonné is that unlike, Lawrence, Bearden’s sales records for some of the galleries have been hard to come by due the changes in leadership.  “Prior to the ’90s, there were so few Black artists represented by major commercial galleries that had the resources to track [their artworks],” Nesbett said. Bearden often sold directly from his studio or gifted works to friends and many of these transactions did not carry proper documentation, making it more difficult to authenticate the provenance of any given artwork being considered for inclusion in the catalogue raisonné.\n\n\tThe Jacob Lawrence catalogue raisonné was published with an accompanying website that is now defunct, making it one of the earliest online catalogues raisonnés. “A printed catalogue raisonné is a snapshot of knowledge at a very specific point in time of publication,” Nesbett explained. “But these objects are all moving around the world and acquiring new social histories and exhibition histories, so the information in the catalogue raisonné is dynamic.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA screenshot of WPI’s The Romare Bearden Catalogue Raisonné Project digital interface. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy WPI\n\t\n\n\n\n\tFor Harris-Kelley, of the Beaden Foundation, that’s the “beauty” of producing a digital catalogue raisonné. “Together with all of the materials that we’ve transferred over and digitized, and we’re able to have a multi-dimensional catalogue,” she said, meaning that not only can it be updated as research continues but readers can access related materials in a way they wouldn’t with a printed catalogue raisonné.\n\n\tThat dynamism isn’t the only reason the foundation pursued this type of publication; a digital catalogue raisonné also provides a rabbit hole of research that could lead to new avenues of inquiry. “With the advent of catalogues raisonnés coming online, the audience is broader,” Gorayeb, of WPI, said. “With these online resources, you can search for a work by Bearden, and in that cataloguing for that Bearden work, you might see another name of a person who was a collector.”\n\n\tWhile there are 210 works identified as Bearden’s as part of the first volume, actual proof of all the artworks existence is still needed for about half of the works. Those that have not been verified are listed black and white images, awaiting the artwork holder to come forth and claim their ownership before being turned into a color image.\n\n\t“Some of them do exist—we know they exist, but we haven’t been contacted by the owners. We have good information on the half that haven’t been verified,” said Camara Holloway, a project manager for WPI who is working on the Bearden catalogue raisonné. But, in some cases, works “have disappeared” altogether.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRomare Bearden, photographed by Gary Schoichet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtesy the photographer, all rights reserved\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis new scholarship, Gorayeb said, helps ground Bearden as the maker of “works that are culturally significant, that have great impact and great import in American history” at a time when his market is also steadily growing. His auction record currently stands at $1.1 million, set in 2021 at a Sotheby’s New York evening sale. A 1980 collage came to auction in this year’s May sales, selling for $952,500, the third highest-price for a Bearden work.  \n\n\tThe compilation of a Bearden catalogue raisonné also comes at a time when the mainstream art world—museums, galleries, auction houses—has begun “recognizing the value of African American art,” Harris-Kelley said. “Just in the last eight to 10 years, there’s been an explosion of young black artists who are really getting their value up and galleries are after them.”\n\n\tAs more and more artists—Black artists and artists of color in particular—reach levels that would warrant that a catalogue raisonné would someday be produced about their work, Nesbett, the Lawrence catalogue raisonné coauthor, said it’s never too early to be organized and meticulous when it comes to an artist’s output. “I think there is a burden on the artist to keep very detailed records of the whereabouts of their work every time they complete a work, and it leaves the studio or even goes into storage,” he said. “Make sure you’ve got full accounting of it.”\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage by Jules Jacot Guil­lar­mod, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nIn 2016, we brought you a rather strange sto­ry about the rival­ry between poet William But­ler Yeats and magi­cian Aleis­ter Crow­ley. Theirs was a feud over the prac­tices of occult soci­ety the Her­met­ic Order of the Gold­en Dawn; but it was also—at least for Crowley—over poet­ry. Crow­ley envied Yeats’ lit­er­ary skill; Yeats could not say the same about Crow­ley. But while he did not nec­es­sar­i­ly respect his ene­my, Yeats feared him, as did near­ly every­one else. As Yeats’ biog­ra­ph­er wrote a few months after Crowley’s death in 1947, “in the old days men and women lived in ter­ror of his evil eye.”\nThe press called Crow­ley “the wickedest man in the world,” a rep­u­ta­tion he did more than enough to cul­ti­vate, iden­ti­fy­ing him­self as the Anti-Christ and dub­bing him­self “The Beast 666.” (Crow­ley may have inspired the “rough beast” of Yeats’ “The Sec­ond Com­ing.”) Crow­ley did not achieve the lit­er­ary recog­ni­tion he desired, but he con­tin­ued to write pro­lif­i­cal­ly after Yeats and oth­ers eject­ed him from the Gold­en Dawn in 1900: poet­ry, fic­tion, crit­i­cism, and man­u­als of sex mag­ic, rit­u­al, and symbolism—some penned dur­ing famed moun­taineer­ing expe­di­tions.\nThrough­out his life, Crow­ley was var­i­ous­ly a moun­taineer, chess prodi­gy, schol­ar, painter, yogi, and founder of a reli­gion he called Thele­ma. He was also a hero­in addict and by many accounts an extreme­ly abu­sive cult leader. How­ev­er one comes down on Crowley’s lega­cy, his influ­ence on the occult and the coun­ter­cul­ture is unde­ni­able. To delve into the his­to­ry of either is to meet him, the mys­te­ri­ous, bizarre, bald fig­ure whose the­o­ries inspired every­one from L. Ron Hub­bard and Anton LaVey to Jim­my Page and Ozzy Osbourne.\nWith­out Crow­ley, it’s hard to imag­ine much of the dark weird­ness of the six­ties and its result­ing flood of cults and eso­teric art. For some occult his­to­ri­ans, the Age of Aquar­ius real­ly began six­ty years ear­li­er, in what Crow­ley called the “Aeon of Horus.” For many oth­ers, Crowley’s influ­ence is inex­plic­a­ble, his books inco­her­ent, and his pres­ence in polite con­ver­sa­tion offen­sive. These are under­stand­able atti­tudes. If you’re a Crow­ley enthu­si­ast, how­ev­er, or sim­ply curi­ous about this leg­endary occultist, you have here a rare oppor­tu­ni­ty to hear the man him­self intone his poems and incan­ta­tions.\n\n“Although this record­ing has pre­vi­ous­ly been avail­able as a ‘Boot­leg,’” say the CD lin­er notes from which this audio comes, “this is its first offi­cial release and to the label’s knowl­edge, con­tains the only known record­ing of Crow­ley.” Record­ed cir­ca 1920 on a wax cylin­der, the audio has been dig­i­tal­ly enhanced, although “sur­face noise may be evi­dent.” (Stream them above, or on this YouTube playlist here.) Indeed, it is dif­fi­cult to make out what Crow­ley is say­ing much of the time, but that’s not only to do with the record­ing qual­i­ty, but with his cryp­tic lan­guage. The first five tracks com­prise “The Call of the First Aethyr” and “The Call of the Sec­ond Aethyr.” Oth­er titles include “La Gitana,” “The Pen­ta­gram,” “The Poet,” “Hymn to the Amer­i­can Peo­ple,” and “Excerpts from the Gnos­tic Mass.”\nIt’s unclear under what cir­cum­stances Crow­ley made these record­ings or why, but like many of his books, they com­bine occult litur­gy, mythol­o­gy, and his own lit­er­ary utter­ances. Love him, hate him, or remain indif­fer­ent, there’s no get­ting around it: Aleis­ter Crow­ley had a tremen­dous influ­ence on the 20th cen­tu­ry and beyond, even if only a very few peo­ple have made seri­ous attempts to under­stand what he was up to with all that sex mag­ic, blood sac­ri­fice, and wicked­ly bawdy verse.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAleis­ter Crow­ley & William But­ler Yeats Get into an Occult Bat­tle, Pit­ting White Mag­ic Against Black Mag­ic (1900)\nAleis­ter Crow­ley: The Wickedest Man in the World Doc­u­ments the Life of the Bizarre Occultist, Poet & Moun­taineer\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tNovember 13th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEven today, the Paris of the pop­u­lar imag­i­na­tion is, for the most part, the Paris envi­sioned by Baron Georges-Eugène Hauss­mann and made a real­i­ty in the eigh­teen-fifties and six­ties. Not that he could order the city built whole: as explained by Manuel Bra­vo in the new video above, Paris had already exist­ed for about two mil­len­nia, grow­ing larg­er, denser, and more intri­cate all the while. But as the pre­fect under Emper­or Napoleon III, Hauss­mann was empow­ered to carve it up by force, open­ing “dozens of wide, long avenues that con­nect­ed impor­tant parts of the city,” a lay­out that “mir­rored the street sys­tem in Rome cre­at­ed 300 years ear­li­er by Pope Six­tus V, but on a much grander scale.”\nHow­ev­er con­sid­er­able the vio­lence it did to medieval Paris, this process of “Hauss­m­an­niza­tion” showed a cer­tain his­tor­i­cal con­scious­ness. After all, the French cap­i­tal was once a Roman city: Lute­tia Pariso­rum, named for the Parisii, the Gal­lic tribe that had inhab­it­ed the island in the mid­dle of the Seine that Parisians now call Île de la Cité.\nAs was their usu­al modus operan­di, the con­quer­ing Romans laid a car­do max­imus run­ning from north to south, today known as Rue Saint-Jacques. There­after, “the rest of the orig­i­nal lay­out was lost to organ­ic growth.” In the form Paris even­tu­al­ly took in the Mid­dle Ages, “there were no pub­lic urban spaces of major sig­nif­i­cance”: no Place Dauphine, no Place des Vos­ges, no Place Vendôme.\nThose very same Parisian squares now enjoyed by locals and tourists alike did much to devel­op the expec­ta­tion of “aes­thet­ic uni­ty” in the city’s built envi­ron­ment, and a cou­ple of cen­turies before Hauss­mann at that. It may not be a com­plete exag­ger­a­tion to call Paris frozen in the Baron’s mid-nine­teenth cen­tu­ry, but as Bra­vo explains, a close exam­i­na­tion of both the city’s cel­e­brat­ed spaces and over­all form reveals the ways in which a much deep­er past has done its part to shape or inspire them. An enthu­si­ast of urban his­to­ry can spend weeks, months, or even years appre­ci­at­ing the details that remind us that the palimpsest of Paris has nev­er quite been over­writ­ten, even in a place as unre­lent­ing­ly exam­ined — if sel­dom tru­ly seen — as the Lou­vre.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nA 3D Ani­ma­tion Reveals What Paris Looked Like When It Was a Roman Town\nTake an Aer­i­al Tour of Medieval Paris\nThe Archi­tec­tur­al His­to­ry of the Lou­vre: 800 Years in Three Min­utes\nA 5‑Hour Walk­ing Tour of Paris and Its Famous Streets, Mon­u­ments & Parks\nA Cin­e­mat­ic Jour­ney Through Paris, As Seen Through the Lens of Leg­endary Film­mak­er Éric Rohmer: Watch Rohmer in Paris\nVenice Explained: Its Archi­tec­ture, Its Streets, Its Canals, and How Best to Expe­ri­ence Them All\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Photography |   \tNovember 12th, 2025  7 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\nYou’ve like­ly heard the rea­son peo­ple nev­er smile in very old pho­tographs. Ear­ly pho­tog­ra­phy could be an excru­ci­at­ing­ly slow process. With expo­sure times of up to 15 min­utes, por­trait sub­jects found it impos­si­ble to hold a grin, which could eas­i­ly slip into a pained gri­mace and ruin the pic­ture. A few min­utes rep­re­sent­ed a marked improve­ment on the time it took to make the very first pho­to­graph, Nicéphore Niépce’s 1826 “heli­o­graph.” Cap­tur­ing the shapes of light and shad­ow out­side his win­dow, Niépce’s image “required an eight-hour expo­sure,” notes the Chris­t­ian Sci­ence Mon­i­tor, “long enough that the sun­light reflects off both sides of the build­ings.”\nNiépce’s busi­ness and invent­ing part­ner is much more well-known: Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre, who went on after Niépce’s death in 1833 to devel­op the Daguerreo­type process, patent­ing it in 1839. That same year, the first self­ie was born. And the year pri­or Daguerre him­self took what most believe to be the very first pho­to­graph of a human, in a street scene of the Boule­vard du Tem­ple in Paris. The image shows us one of Daguerre’s ear­ly suc­cess­ful attempts at image-mak­ing, in which, writes NPR’s Robert Krul­wich, “he exposed a chem­i­cal­ly treat­ed met­al plate for ten min­utes. Oth­ers were walk­ing or rid­ing in car­riages down that busy street that day, but because they moved, they didn’t show up.”\nVis­i­ble, how­ev­er, in the low­er left quad­rant is a man stand­ing with his hands behind his back, one leg perched on a plat­form. A clos­er look reveals the fuzzy out­line of the per­son shin­ing his boots. A much fin­er-grained analy­sis of the pho­to­graph shows what may be oth­er, less dis­tinct fig­ures, includ­ing what looks like two women with a cart or pram, a child’s face in a win­dow, and var­i­ous oth­er passers­by. The pho­to­graph marks a his­tor­i­cal­ly impor­tant peri­od in the devel­op­ment of the medi­um, one in which pho­tog­ra­phy passed from curios­i­ty to rev­o­lu­tion­ary tech­nol­o­gy for both artists and sci­en­tists.\n\nAlthough Daguerre had been work­ing on a reli­able method since the 1820s, it wasn’t until 1838, the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Muse­um of Art explains, that his “con­tin­ued exper­i­ments pro­gressed to the point where he felt com­fort­able show­ing exam­ples of the new medi­um to select­ed artists and sci­en­tists in the hope of lin­ing up investors.” Photography’s most pop­u­lar 19th cen­tu­ry use—perhaps then as now—was as a means of cap­tur­ing faces. But Daguerre’s ear­li­est plates “were still life com­po­si­tions of plas­ter casts after antique sculp­ture,” lend­ing “the ‘aura’ of art to pic­tures made by mechan­i­cal means.” He also took pho­tographs of shells and fos­sils, demon­strat­ing the medium’s util­i­ty for sci­en­tif­ic pur­pos­es.\nIf por­traits were per­haps less inter­est­ing to Daguerre’s investors, they were essen­tial to his suc­ces­sors and admir­ers. Can­did shots of peo­ple mov­ing about their dai­ly lives as in this Paris street scene, how­ev­er, proved next to impos­si­ble for sev­er­al more decades. What was for­mer­ly believed to be the old­est such pho­to­graph, an 1848 image from Cincin­nati, shows what appears to be two men stand­ing at the edge of the Ohio Riv­er. It seems as though they’ve come to fetch water, but they must have been stand­ing very still to have appeared so clear­ly. Pho­tog­ra­phy seemed to stop time, freez­ing a sta­t­ic moment for­ev­er in phys­i­cal form. Blurred images of peo­ple mov­ing through the frame expose the illu­sion. Even in the stillest, stiffest of images, there is move­ment, an insight Ead­weard Muy­bridge would make cen­tral to his exper­i­ments in motion pho­tog­ra­phy just a few decades after Daguerre debuted his world-famous method.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe First Pho­to­graph Ever Tak­en (1826)\nThe First “Self­ie” In His­to­ry Tak­en by Robert Cor­nelius, a Philadel­phia Chemist, in 1839\nEad­weard Muybridge’s Motion Pho­tog­ra­phy Exper­i­ments from the 1870s Pre­sent­ed in 93 Ani­mat­ed Gifs\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, Music |   \tNovember 12th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nEach of us has a dif­fer­ent idea of when, exact­ly, the six­ties end­ed, not as a decade, but as a dis­tinct cul­tur­al peri­od. Some have a notion of the “long six­ties” that extends well into the sev­en­ties; if pressed for a spe­cif­ic final year, they could do worse than point­ing to 1972, when David Bowie made his epoch-shift­ing appear­ance as Zig­gy Star­dust, backed by the Spi­ders from Mars, on the BBC’s Top of the Pops. It was also the year he released music videos for “Space Odd­i­ty,” the sin­gle that had begun to make his name at the time of the moon land­ing in 1969, and “Jean Genie,” the first sin­gle from Aladdin Sane, an album inspired in part by the debauch­ery of the Amer­i­can Zig­gy tour he under­took after blast­ing off into star­dom.\n\n\n\t\n\n\nHav­ing strug­gled in the six­ties to find a suit­able iden­ti­ty and audi­ence, the young Bowie devel­oped an unusu­al­ly strong under­stand­ing of not just the music indus­try, but also the cul­ture itself. One era was giv­ing way to anoth­er, and nobody knew it bet­ter than he did. When all those hir­sute fig­ures in beards and den­im, singing with osten­ta­tious earnest­ness about love and free­dom, dis­ap­peared, who would replace them?\nIn Bowie’s vision, the next phase belonged to clean-shaven, made-up androg­y­nes in flam­boy­ant design­er cos­tumes work­ing grand, some­times sci­ence fic­tion­al, and often inscrutable themes into what would strike con­cert­go­ers as almost com­plete the­atri­cal expe­ri­ences — and he would be the first and fore­most among them.\n\n\n\t\n\nBowie, in oth­er words, made the sev­en­ties his own, oper­at­ing on his knowl­edge of and instincts about the media envi­ron­ment of that decade and how images would be made in it. By that time, he’d seen too many flash­es in the pan of pop music to get com­pla­cent about his own prospects for endurance. The recep­tion of “Space Odd­i­ty” as a nov­el­ty song did its part to moti­vate him to come up with his bisex­u­al space-alien rock-star alter ego — and to moti­vate him to ter­mi­nate that per­sona on stage in 1973. A cou­ple of years before that, he had already sung of the impor­tance of changes, a kind of man­i­festo that would guide his career through all the decades that remained. Nev­er would Bowie adhere to a par­tic­u­lar musi­cal or aes­thet­ic style for very long, an abid­ing ten­den­cy vivid­ly on dis­play in this playlist of 50 music videos on his offi­cial YouTube chan­nel.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe expe­ri­ence of putting out music videos in the sev­en­ties placed Bowie well, espe­cial­ly com­pared to oth­er artists of his gen­er­a­tion, to make his mark on MTV in the eight­ies with a sta­di­um-ready hit like “Let’s Dance.” The nineties found him tak­ing the form in new direc­tions, as with the cinephili­cal­ly astute video for “Jump They Say” and the dar­ing­ly action-free visu­al treat­ment of the reflec­tive “Thurs­day’s Child” (from the album Hours…, which began as the sound­track to the com­put­er game Omikron: The Nomad Soul). Apart from this playlist, his chan­nel also con­tains music videos for his lat­er songs from the two-thou­sands and twen­ty-tens, from “New Killer Star” to “The Stars (Are Out Tonight)” to “Black­star” — the nature of star­dom hav­ing been a pre­oc­cu­pa­tion since the begin­ning, even though he kept on chang­ing to the very end.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch David Bowie Star in His First Film Role, a Short Hor­ror Flick Called The Image (1967)\nWatch David Bowie Per­form “Star­man” on Top of the Pops: Vot­ed the Great­est Music Per­for­mance Ever on the BBC (1972)\nDavid Bowie Per­forms “Life on Mars?” and “Ash­es to Ash­es” on John­ny Carson’s “Tonight Show” (1980)\nDavid Bowie’s Music Video “Jump They Say” Pays Trib­ute to Marker’s La Jetée, Godard’s Alphav­ille, Welles’ The Tri­al & Kubrick’s 2001\nWatch David Bowie’s New Video for “The Stars (Are Out Tonight)” With Til­da Swin­ton\nWhen Bowie & Jagger’s “Danc­ing in the Street” Music Video Becomes a Silent Film\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhile walking in public parks near her home in Melbourne, Ying Ang spotted fleshy spores poking through autumn leaves and spring grass. The photographer decided to document these distinctive growths, which soon had her thinking about the process of decay and regeneration.\nNow compiled in a book titled Fruiting Bodies, Ying’s images glimpse a variety of common mushrooms from ground level. Her lens pokes through blades of grass to peer upwards at the spongy underbellies of the growths, capturing their unique textures and colors in impeccable detail.\n\nYing utilizes the collection as an opportunity to delve into ecofeminism and the relationship between productivity and fertility, a historically fraught link when considering a woman’s presumed role of wife and mother. She explains: \n\nLike the female body, mushrooms have been understood and valued primarily through their reproductive function. Yet, beneath the surface, a vast underground mycelial network is vital in ways that defy conventional visibility: in care, in knowledge, in reciprocity.\n\nFruiting Bodies is published by Perimeter Editions, and you can find more from Ying on her website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for his vivid portrait photography, Yannis Davy Guibinga is interested in the intersection of art and public spaces. This is especially apropos when it comes to celebrating culture, heritage, and a sense of belonging for “a new generation of Africans who embrace the multiplicity of their heritage in a globalized world,” says a statement for his new project, Of Colour.\nGuibinga taps into color as a means of communication—a language that can be used for storytelling, conveying emotions, and embodying symbols of identity. Saturated hues and the interplay of light and shadow reflect “joy, pride, and the complexity of Black experience.”\n\nThrough bold, large-scale portraits, Guibinga says that he aims “to explore how colour carries emotion and identity, expanding my ongoing work on contemporary African representation.” Presented in collaboration with Los Angeles-based media company StandardVision, Of Colour comprises several vibrant compositions by the Montréal-based artist that alternate across eight billboards throughout November.\nSee more on his website and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe poetic idea that “doors are the architecture of intimacy” grounds a new installation by Portuguese artist Alexandre Farto, a.k.a. Vhils (previously). Against the stunning desert backdrop of the Pyramids of Giza, “Doors of Cairo” is a site-specific work featuring a layered collection of Vhils’ distinctive etched portraits. Faces peer out from the weathered structures, some of which nest in the sand while others tower above on scaffolding.\nContrasting the ancient tombs with an installation that will dot the landscape for just a month, Vhils explores the ways we mark the world and how our imprints endure over time. “The pyramids were built for kings and gods, meant to last forever. My installation is made from wood and memory, and it will soon disappear,” he says. “Yet both belong to the same human impulse, to build, to remember, to leave a trace.”\n\n“Doors of Cairo” is part of the fifth Forever Is Now project, an ongoing exhibition curated by Art D’Égypte with the support of UNESCO. Vhils is the first Portuguese artist invited to participate in the project, and he tethers his homeland to the historic site. All 65 repurposed doors were sourced from demolition sites and renovation projects between the two countries, and each bears traces of former use, whether chipped paint, scuffed surfaces, or faint fingerprints that linger in a well-worn spot.\nThe fragmented portraits don’t depict anyone specific but rather function as stand-ins for people past and present. “A single face can represent one person, but it can also stand for a community, a generation, or a shared emotional landscape,” the artist says. “It speaks to how people and places are inseparable, how memory becomes embedded in matter, and how identity is built from many invisible layers.”\nAfter six months of carving in his studio—and creating a smaller, sculptural iteration that will live beyond the outdoor installation—Vhils spent three days working on site, shaping and reshaping the composition. “It evolved intuitively, door by door, guided by their scale, texture, and rhythm,” he shares. “This project is a dialogue between the everyday and the eternal, between the wooden doors of ordinary lives and the stone pyramids that have outlasted civilisations. It is a reminder that even what is temporary can carry the weight of time.”\n“Doors of Cairo” is on view through December 7. Find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Literature, Random |   \tDecember 19th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt was some­thing of a Christ­mas rit­u­al at Hunter S. Thomp­son’s Col­orado cab­in, Owl Farm. Every year, his sec­re­tary Deb­o­rah Fuller would take down the Christ­mas tree and leave it on the front porch rather than dis­pose of it entire­ly. That’s because Hunter, more often than not, want­ed to set it on fire. In 1990, Sam Allis, a writer for the then for­mi­da­ble TIME mag­a­zine, vis­it­ed Thomp­son’s home and watched the fiery tra­di­tion unfold. He wrote:\nI gave up on the inter­view and start­ed wor­ry­ing about my life when Hunter Thomp­son squirt­ed two cans of fire starter on the Christ­mas tree he was going to burn in his liv­ing-room fire­place, a few feet away from an unopened wood­en crate of 9‑mm bul­lets. That the tree was far too large to fit into the fire­place mat­tered not a whit to Hunter, who was sport­ing a dime-store wig at the time and resem­bled Tony Perkins in Psy­cho. Min­utes ear­li­er, he had smashed a Polaroid cam­era on the floor.\nHunter had decid­ed to video­tape the Christ­mas tree burn­ing, and we lat­er heard on the replay the ter­ri­fied voic­es of Deb­o­rah Fuller, his long­time sec­re­tary-baby sit­ter, and me off-cam­era plead­ing with him, “NO, HUNTER, NO! PLEASE, HUNTER, DON’T DO IT!” The orig­i­nal man­u­script of Hell’s Angels was on the table, and there were the bul­lets. Noth­ing doing. Thomp­son was a man pos­sessed by now, full of the Chivas Regal he had been slurp­ing straight from the bot­tle and the gin he had been mix­ing with pink lemon­ade for hours.\nThe wood­en man­tel above the fire­place appar­ent­ly still has burn marks on it today.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen considering Miguel Arzabe’s bold, woven works, it’s unsurprising that he begins by painting two abstract pieces. Vibrant fields of acrylic spread across his canvases before they’re sliced into long strips and reconfigured. Resulting are dynamic compositions that meld art historical traditions with Arzabe’s Bolivian heritage, drawing on longstanding Andean imagery and weaving practices.\nNext month at Johansson Projects, the Oakland-based artist presents a collection of new wall works and suspended sculptures in Sin Contar Cincuenta. Arzabe refers to his practice as offering a “productive confrontation” of distinct cultures, approaches, and periods, and these new compositions continue his explorations into imagining spaces where differences exist in harmony. \n“La Bahía de Niebla” (2025), woven acrylic on canvas, 48 x 60 inches\nThe artist often roots his work in place and connections to a particular environment, and several pieces evoke vast landscapes and weather. “La Bahía de Niebla,” for example, echoes the dense opacity of Bay Area fog, while the elongated form reminiscent of an atoll sprawls across “Isla del Lago.” \nSin Contar Cincuenta is on view from January 17 to March 21 in Oakland.

Smooth wings and bodies contrast the fluffy feathers typical of fowl, as they hunch over or curl up as if taking a nap. Elegant and seemingly primed for flight, the avians perch between abstract and realistic representations.\nTheakston has several exhibitions and fairs planned for 2026, including Naarden Art Fair and Brussels Affordable Art Fair with DeKunst Salon and the Washington Winter Show and Art Palm Beach with Gladwell and Patterson.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAt the start of a new short film, a young boy is gifted a present of a stuffed wolf at a family dinner—an animal he’s afraid of. We’re soon transported to a forest, where we witness a wily tale of compassion and friendship. The film has gone viral since it was released in early December, but this animated gem wasn’t created by Disney or Pixar—it’s a grocery store ad. And it’s shed some unexpectedly bright light on both the joys of the holiday season and the inimitable warmth of human-made film.\nFrench supermarket chain Intermarché launched its advertisement titled “Le mal aimé,” or “Unloved,” during a season in which Coca-Cola’s annual ad was made with generative AI and news of Disney’s licensing agreement with OpenAI means that more than 200 of the media conglomerate’s characters can be used in the generative AI app Sora.\n\n\n\n“Unloved,” which is set to a 1970s French hit song by Claude François titled “Le mal aimé,” quickly went viral online with hundreds of millions of views outside of France. The project was produced by an advertising agency called Romance, and the two-and-a-half-minute project took a team of 80 people about a year to create.\nThe commercial’s painterly scenes and expressive characters meet an emphasis on creativity, humor, generosity, and glee. Indeed, the protagonist—a lone wolf—learns that through making something with his own hands, requiring lots of practice, he can cook the magic ingredient to help him connect with others.\nFor more handmade cinematic advertising, you might also enjoy Apple’s refreshingly analog holiday ad this year.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo via Wikimedia Commons, CC0 1.0 Universal)\n    \n        \n            A controversial monument to \"victims of communism\" in downtown Ottawa will no longer include the names of specific people after the Canadian government reportedly discovered potential Nazi affiliations among the commemorated individuals. The memorial, \"Canada, a Land of Refuge,\" originally proposed under conservative former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, was inaugurated last December by the government of Canada and Tribute to Liberty, an organization formed to build a monument honoring those \"affected by communism.\" Over 500 specific names were reportedly expected to be engraved on the memorial within a year of its unveiling, though Jewish groups and historians raised concerns for years that over half of the individuals could have been Nazi collaborators in the Holocaust. The monument's unveiling was delayed amid the controversy. This week, one year after the memorial's unveiling, the Department of Canadian Heritage said that it no longer planned to etch specific names into the memorial.“The Government of Canada has emphasized that all aspects of the Memorial to the Victims of Communism must align with Canadian values of democracy and human rights,” Caroline Czajkowski, a spokesperson for the Department of Canadian Heritage, told Hyperallergic in a statement. “The Wall of Remembrance will now solely feature thematic content that conveys the broader commemorative and educational intent of the Memorial.” When Hyperallergic asked Tribute to Liberty about reports that Nazi connections were discovered among the commemorated, the organization provided a statement alleging that \"Kremlin-aligned activists and commentators in Canada have relentlessly spread disinformation targeting Central and Eastern European diaspora communities.\"The monument comprises 4,000 metal rods designed by Paul Raff Studio, a central element of the memorial called the “Arc of Memory,” and is \"intended to express the vastness of people who suffered under communist regimes,\" according to the Department of Canadian Heritage.According to government records obtained by the Ottawa Citizen under freedom of information laws, the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a local Holocaust education organization, warned the Canadian government in 2021 that one individual whose name was to be included, Ukrainian nationalist Roman Shukhevych, was connected to the killings of Jews. Some names had already been engraved on the monument, including that of Janis Niedra, who was reportedly connected to a massacre of 350 Jews in Latvia. These names had been reportedly previously removed from the monument. Hyperallergic has contacted Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        ",

(photo courtesy NEA)\n    \n        \n            Political consultant Mary Anne Carter, who served as the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) during the first Trump administration, will lead the agency again following Senate approval this week. Carter's appointment comes almost a year after Maria Rosario Jackson, a former Biden-appointed chair of the agency, stepped down from the post one day after Trump was inaugurated for a second term. Jackson was the first African American and the first Mexican-American person to lead the federal arts agency. In the 11 months since Jackson stepped down, the NEA rescinded arts grants en masse, notifying awardees that their projects were cancelled as the agency refocused on promoting “skilled trade jobs,” “AI competency,” “support [for] the military and veterans.” The NEA also terminated a longstanding grant program, Challenge America, that was geared toward \"underserved communities.\" Senior officials within the NEA resigned in May amid the cuts. Trump had also threatened to eliminate the agency entirely in a budget proposal earlier this year. In September, the American Civil Liberties Union won a lawsuit it filed against the NEA for asking applicants to abstain from funding anything that could be considered to be \"gender ideology,\" as defined by the Trump administration.After Carter's first appointment in 2018, reporters pointed out that she had served on Trump's presidential inaugural committee. A public LinkedIn account also notes that she served as director for Republican Rick Scott's transition to governor in 2011, later becoming his office's chief policy advisor. Her LinkedIn also includes experiences as a radio talk show host and campaign strategist. Notably, in the 1990s, she worked for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, which helped shape Trump's Project 2025 far-right policy agenda. \"The arts are essential to creating, innovating, healing, and recovery, and they provide vital economic stability to communities across the nation,\" Carter said in a press release. \"I look forward to the many celebrations that will take place in 2026 in honor of America’s 250th anniversary, as well as to the agency’s continued research into the powerful role the arts play in healing—from illness to trauma to natural disasters.” There is no indication that Carter has any specific experience working in fields related to arts and culture, aside from her previous tenure at the NEA. When Jackson was appointed in 2021, she served as a tenured professor at Arizona State University’s Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts. Carter was first nominated to lead the NEA in May, but was not officially approved by the Senate until yesterday, December 18. Her approval comes as the board of the Kennedy Center for the Arts, which is chaired by Trump, voted to rename the Washington, DC, organization the “Trump-Kennedy Center.” Trump’s name was affixed to the center’s facade this morning. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nMost every­one who knows the work of George Orwell knows his 1946 essay “Pol­i­tics and the Eng­lish Lan­guage” (pub­lished here), in which he rails against care­less, con­fus­ing, and unclear prose. “Our civ­i­liza­tion is deca­dent,” he argues, “and our lan­guage… must inevitably share in the gen­er­al col­lapse.” The exam­ples Orwell quotes are all guilty in var­i­ous ways of “stal­e­ness of imagery” and “lack of pre­ci­sion.”\nUlti­mate­ly, Orwell claims, bad writ­ing results from cor­rupt think­ing, and often attempts to make palat­able cor­rupt acts: “Polit­i­cal speech and writ­ing are large­ly the defense of the inde­fen­si­ble.” His exam­ples of colo­nial­ism, forced depor­ta­tions, and bomb­ing cam­paigns find ready ana­logues in our own time. Pay atten­tion to how the next arti­cle, inter­view, or book you read uses lan­guage “favor­able to polit­i­cal con­for­mi­ty” to soft­en ter­ri­ble things.\nOrwell’s analy­sis iden­ti­fies sev­er­al cul­prits that obscure mean­ing and lead to whole para­graphs of bom­bas­tic, emp­ty prose:\nDying metaphors: essen­tial­ly clichés, which “have lost all evoca­tive pow­er and are mere­ly used because they save peo­ple the trou­ble of invent­ing phras­es for them­selves.”\nOper­a­tors or ver­bal false limbs: these are the wordy, awk­ward con­struc­tions in place of a sin­gle, sim­ple word. Some exam­ples he gives include “exhib­it a ten­den­cy to,” “serve the pur­pose of,” “play a lead­ing part in,” “have the effect of.” (One par­tic­u­lar peeve of mine when I taught Eng­lish com­po­si­tion was the phrase “due to the fact that” for the far sim­pler “because.”)\nPre­ten­tious dic­tion: Orwell iden­ti­fies a num­ber of words he says “are used to dress up a sim­ple state­ment and give an air of sci­en­tif­ic impar­tial­i­ty to biased judg­ments.” He also includes in this cat­e­go­ry “jar­gon pecu­liar to Marx­ist writ­ing” (“pet­ty bour­geois,” “lack­ey,” “flunkey,” “hye­na”).\nMean­ing­less words: Abstrac­tions, such as “roman­tic,” “plas­tic,” “val­ues,” “human,” “sen­ti­men­tal,” etc. used “in the sense that they not only do not point to any dis­cov­er­able object, but are hard­ly ever expect­ed to do so by the read­er.” Orwell also damns such polit­i­cal buzz­words as “democ­ra­cy,” “social­ism,” “free­dom,” “patri­ot­ic,” “jus­tice,” and “fas­cism,” since they each have “sev­er­al dif­fer­ent mean­ings which can­not be rec­on­ciled with one anoth­er.”\nMost read­ers of Orwell’s essay inevitably point out that Orwell him­self has com­mit­ted some of the faults he finds in oth­ers, but will also, with some intro­spec­tion, find those same faults in their own writ­ing. Any­one who writes in an insti­tu­tion­al context—be it acad­e­mia, jour­nal­ism, or the cor­po­rate world—acquires all sorts of bad habits that must be bro­ken with delib­er­ate intent. “The process” of learn­ing bad writ­ing habits “is reversible” Orwell promis­es, “if one is will­ing to take the nec­es­sary trou­ble.” How should we pro­ceed? These are the rules Orwell sug­gests:\n(i) Nev­er use a metaphor, sim­i­le, or oth­er fig­ure of speech which you are used to see­ing in print.\n(ii) Nev­er use a long word where a short one will do.\n(iii) If it is pos­si­ble to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n(iv) Nev­er use the pas­sive where you can use the active.\n(v) Nev­er use a for­eign phrase, a sci­en­tif­ic word, or a jar­gon word if you can think of an every­day Eng­lish equiv­a­lent.\n(vi) Break any of these rules soon­er than say any­thing out­right bar­barous.\nWhat con­sti­tutes “out­right bar­barous” word­ing he does not say, exact­ly. As the inter­net cliché has it: Your Mileage May Vary. You may find cre­ative ways to break these rules with­out there­by being obscure or jus­ti­fy­ing mass mur­der.\nBut Orwell does pref­ace his guide­lines with some very sound advice: “Prob­a­bly it is bet­ter to put off using words as long as pos­si­ble and get one’s mean­ing as clear as one can through pic­tures and sen­sa­tions. After­ward one can choose—not sim­ply accept—the phras­es that will best cov­er the mean­ing.” Not only does this prac­tice get us clos­er to using clear, spe­cif­ic, con­crete lan­guage, but it results in writ­ing that grounds our read­ers in the sen­so­ry world we all share to some degree, rather than the airy world of abstract thought and belief that we don’t.\nThese “ele­men­tary” rules do not cov­er “the lit­er­ary use of lan­guage,” writes Orwell, “but mere­ly lan­guage as an instru­ment for express­ing and not for con­ceal­ing or pre­vent­ing thought.” In the almost eighty years since his essay, the qual­i­ty of Eng­lish prose has like­ly not improved, but our ready access to writ­ing guides of all kinds has. Those who care about clar­i­ty of thought and respon­si­ble use of rhetoric would do well to con­sult them often, and to read, or re-read, Orwell’s essay.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2016.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\n10 Writ­ing Tips from Leg­endary Writ­ing Teacher William Zinss­er\nStephen King’s 20 Rules for Writ­ers\nV.S.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Comics/Cartoons, History |   \tDecember 4th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe Adven­tures of Tintin may be a chil­dren’s com­ic series from mid-twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry Europe, but its appeal has long since tran­scend­ed the bound­aries of form, cul­ture, and gen­er­a­tion. In fact, many if not most seri­ous­ly ded­i­cat­ed fans of Tintin are in mid­dle age and beyond, and few of them can have avoid­ed ever con­sid­er­ing the ques­tion of his cre­ator’s activ­i­ties dur­ing the Sec­ond World War. Georges Remi, known by the nom de plume Hergé, was born to a low­er-mid­dle-class fam­i­ly in a Brus­sels sub­urb in 1907: utter­ly mun­dane begin­nings, per­haps, but ones that would lead to what the apoc­ryphal ancient Chi­nese curse calls inter­est­ing times, even for a young man whose inter­ests did­n’t run far past scout­ing and draw­ing.\nAfter serv­ing in the Bel­gian army, explains his­to­ry YouTu­ber Mark Fel­ton in his new video above, Remi was hired by the con­ser­v­a­tive Catholic paper Le Vingtième Siè­cle to draw comics for its chil­dren’s sup­ple­ment Le Petit Vingtième. It was there that he became Hergé and cre­at­ed the boy reporter Tintin, whom the paper’s edi­tor asked to be sent to a fic­tion­al­ized Sovi­et Union in order to expose the evils of the Bol­she­viks. Pop­u­lar­i­ty came imme­di­ate­ly, and built up to the degree that an actor was hired to put his hair into a quiff and “return” by train to an appre­cia­tive crowd in Brus­sels upon the sto­ry’s con­clu­sion. There fol­lowed the fur­ther adven­tures of Tintin in the Con­go (at the time, a Bel­gian colony) and Tintin in Amer­i­ca, both of which have since come in for a great deal of crit­i­cism for their reliance on stereo­types.\nThough very much his own artist, Hergé at this stage let the pol­i­tics of Tintin sto­ries be dic­tat­ed by high­er-ups. Con­ceived in response to Japan’s inva­sion of Manchuria, The Blue Lotus, from 1934, did offer him an oppor­tu­ni­ty to increase the real­ism of his art, ren­der­ing the look and feel of Chi­na as accu­rate­ly as his research could make pos­si­ble; he con­tin­ued to incor­po­rate large amounts of detail from all over the world into The Bro­ken Ear, The Black Island, and King Ottokar’s Scep­tre. Though that last deals with fic­tion­al Euro­pean coun­tries, it also clear­ly sat­i­rizes the inva­sive ten­den­cies of Hitler’s Ger­many — which would come for Hergé’s home­land in 1940, shut­ting down Le Petit Vingtième, putting him out of a job, and even req­ui­si­tion­ing his home.\nEven­tu­al­ly, Hergé land­ed on his feet and joined Le Soir, Bel­gium’s largest French-lan­guage news­pa­per. Though he could pub­lish Tintin there, the Nazis had turned it into their ide­o­log­i­cal mouth­piece, a fact that did­n’t reflect well on Hergé after the Allied vic­to­ry. He found him­self black­list­ed and cat­e­go­rized with the thou­sands of Bel­gian col­lab­o­ra­tors who could receive the death penal­ty or life in prison, but an inves­ti­ga­tion into his case found him to be “a blun­der­er rather than a trai­tor” — shades of P. G. Wode­house mak­ing broad­casts about the lighter side of intern­ment for the Gestapo. His good stand­ing as a cit­i­zen and artist was even­tu­al­ly restored, though even today, his wartime activ­i­ties are occa­sion­al­ly called into ques­tion. Still, he was able to con­tin­ue Tintin’s adven­tures until he died in 1983, engag­ing in only the kind of col­lab­o­ra­tion he could do with his staff at Stu­dios Hergé.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHergé Draws Tintin in Vin­tage Footage (and What Explains the Character’s Endur­ing Appeal)\nHow Andy Warhol and Tintin Cre­ator Hergé Mutu­al­ly Admired and Influ­enced One Anoth­er\nComics Inspired by Wait­ing for Godot, Fea­tur­ing Tintin, Roz Chast, and Beav­is & Butthead\nHow Dis­ney Fought Fas­cism with Pro­pa­gan­da Car­toons Dur­ing World War II & Avert­ed Finan­cial Col­lapse\nHow the Nazis Waged War on Mod­ern Art: Inside the “Degen­er­ate Art” Exhi­bi­tion of 1937\nThe Nazis’ 10 Con­trol-Freak Rules for Jazz Per­form­ers: A Strange List from World War II\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tDecember 5th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt would be impos­si­ble to under­stand West­ern civ­i­liza­tion with­out under­stand­ing the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ty. But in order to do that, it may serve us well to think of it as the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ties, plur­al. So sug­gests Hochela­ga cre­ator Tom­mie Trelawny in the new video above, which explains the Gnos­tic Gospels, the “for­bid­den teach­ings of Jesus.” As a sys­tem of beliefs, Gnos­ti­cism is a fair­ly far cry from the main­stream forms of Chris­tian­i­ty with which most of us are famil­iar today. But its sur­viv­ing texts may sound uncan­ni­ly famil­iar, despite also involv­ing out­landish-sound­ing ele­ments that seem to belong to anoth­er civ­i­liza­tion entire­ly. Gnos­tic teach­ings have long been con­sid­ered heresy by Chris­tians, but do they real­ly rep­re­sent just a dif­fer­ent evo­lu­tion­ary branch of the faith: anoth­er Chris­tian­i­ty?\nReli­gious schol­ars of many stripes have con­cerned them­selves with few mat­ters as inten­sive­ly as they have with theod­i­cy, that is, the mat­ter of how to square the notion of a good, omnipo­tent deity with the obvi­ous exis­tence of evil down here in the world. Since its loose coali­tion of beliefs came togeth­er in the late first cen­tu­ry, Gnos­ti­cism has pro­posed an ele­gant solu­tion: that the deity is not, in fact, good, or rather, that under the tran­scen­dent, unknow­able God is a much more poor­ly behaved “demi­urge” who dis­plays an indif­fer­ence, at best, to the lot of human­i­ty. In this view, our result­ing world is less a per­fect cre­ation than a cos­mic mis­take — a propo­si­tion that would account for cer­tain of its qual­i­ties we expe­ri­ence on the day-to-day lev­el, even if we have no par­tic­u­lar reli­gious pro­cliv­i­ties.\nThanks to the dis­cov­ery of Egyp­t’s Nag Ham­ma­di library in 1945, we can direct­ly access many of the teach­ings of the so-called “Gnos­tic Gospels.” They tell us, to make a few grand sim­pli­fi­ca­tions, that our real­i­ty is illu­so­ry and that we can only come to grasp the true nature of both it and our­selves through eso­teric learn­ing, gno­sis being the ancient Greek term for knowl­edge. This world­view may bring to mind that of cer­tain Greek philoso­phers, or indeed that of The Matrix, a near-oblig­a­tory ref­er­ence for a video like this. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry on from that movie, it’s not hard to under­stand why it res­onat­ed with the siz­able-enough pro­por­tion of human­i­ty who feel alien­at­ed from who they real­ly are or what the world real­ly is — and who, any mil­len­ni­um now, would make rea­son­ably promis­ing can­di­dates to bring about a Gnos­tic revival.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n3,500 Occult Man­u­scripts Will Be Dig­i­tized & Made Freely Avail­able Online, Thanks to The Da Vin­ci Code Author Dan Brown\nBehold the Codex Gigas (aka “Devil’s Bible”), the Largest Medieval Man­u­script in the World\nThe Phi­los­o­phy of The Matrix: From Pla­to and Descartes, to East­ern Phi­los­o­phy\nThe Ancient Greeks Who Con­vert­ed to Bud­dhism\nDis­cov­er Thomas Jefferson’s Cut-and-Paste Ver­sion of the Bible, and Read the Curi­ous Edi­tion Online\nHow Our Depic­tion of Jesus Changed Over 2,000 Years and What He May Have Actu­al­ly Looked Like\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLocated in the Yangtze River Delta, Hangzhou is enmeshed in waterways. The city’s center abuts a large lake and sits just north of the Qiantang River, infamous for its magnificent tidal bore that sweeps through the region each fall.\nFor their latest project presented in the Hangzhou Triennial of Fiber Art at Zhejiang Art Museum, Jin Choi and Thomas Shine merged aspects of this local environment and culture with their distinctive process. The artists, who work as Choi + Shine Architects, often create sweeping lace isntallations crocheted in partnership with local communities. Choi typically designs the motif, while Shine focuses on the structure itself. \n\nSuspended above reflective surface mimicking a dark body of water, “Distance” comprises crocheted sculptures representing all 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac. “As society evolves, [the zodiac] continues to find relevance, connecting to the wisdom of the past and the shared narratives that shape our identities today,” the artists write. “Its legacy, with its rich symbolism, cultural significance and unifying power, will endure as a navigational tool in the current and future social shifts.”\nRather than depict a dog or rabbit in its entirety, Choi isolated elements of each animal—find preliminary sketches and reference imagery on the artists’ website. The ox, for example, is represented through a slender tube evocative of a horn, while the rooster can be spotted through a fan-like plume. \nThe installation’s structure is circular and appears to shift depending on the viewer’s perpseicve. “The composition loses its legible visual order and the elements start to form different relations, allowing for varying compositions,” the artists say. This emphasizes “one’s power to position oneself in reference to others, to actively define different connections and relationships.”\nAs for the making-of, Choi + Shine know that community members come to their collaborative process with varying levels of craft experience. Their projects often become educational sessions in addition to community gatherings, as participants demonstrate a particular stitch or help troubleshoot issues. \n\n“Many volunteers are actually novices in crochet, and there are many complex patterns. They may not be very good at crochet, so we are in the process of communicating and collaborating. Beginners and skilled volunteers help each other,” said Wu Qin, who led volunteer efforts for this isntallation.\n“Distance” is now permanently isntalled at the Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen we look at a leaf, we see a predominantly flat plane, intersected by a midrib and myriad veins, or perhaps dotted with ailments like fungi or the eggs of insects. But imagine what these bits of foliage would look like if blown up like balloons. Artist Syd Carpenter responds “to the garden as a source of form” with her Expanded Leaf series. Imagining a papery leaf if it were inflated, perhaps to the size of a cat, the resulting forms take on “the girth, weight and physicality of animals,” she says.\nCarpenter is known for her clay-based practice exploring the body, land, agriculture, and African American history. She taps into the ancient legacy of the material, merging the timeless medium with contemporary concerns. Perception and expectations are thoughtfully challenged as we encounter bulbous, creature-like beings that simultaneously seem alive and inanimate.\n“Indiana Hutson” (2021), clay, 11 x 24 x 23 inches\n\nIn her recent Farm Bowl series, Carpenter considers another enduring juxtaposition, especially in the world of craft: form and function. She transforms the ubiquitous shape of a bowl into a series of tableaux that delve into relationships between African Americans and the land. Investigating ideas of utility, labor, place, and narrative, the sculptures are encircled by farm animals, foodstuffs, modest houses, and fences.\n“The handmade bowl is a universal form with equivalent examples represented in every culture,” Carpenter says in a statement. “It is an open, round form with an inner recessed chamber rising from a smaller foot to a wider rim. Bowls can serve ritualistically or as mundane, utilitarian objects.” In their nearly universal applications and ageless form, the bowl provides a unique way of “holding” African American experiences and connections to the land.\nA major retrospective of Carpenter’s work, Planting in Space, Time, and Memory, opens in January at the Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia. Running concurrently, another solo show titled Home Bound in Wood, Steel, and Clay runs from January 22 to April 5 at the Berman Museum of Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pennsylvania.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown as Tse Bitai to the Diné (Navajo) people, or “winged rock,” Ship Rock in New Mexico is an otherworldly geological formation rising out of the desert that can be seen for miles around. The result of a massive volcanic eruption, the unique outcrop consists of a monolithic stack and at least six radiating, serpentine ridges of long-cooled lava.\nOriginally, Ship Rock was likely a few thousand feet below the ground, but gradual erosion over tens of millions of years has revealed its jagged shape. For Karol Nienartowicz, who won second place in this year’s International Landscape Photographer of the Year contest, the natural landmark was an irresistible place to document from the air as a storm rolled through the Navajo Nation.\nLukas Trixl (Austria), “The Land Before Time,” New Plymouth, North Island, New Zealand\nOne of more than 3,600 entries from photographers around the world for the competition’s 12th edition, Nienartowicz’s image is joined by dozens more honorable mentions that highlight the astonishing diversity of our planet’s surface. Forests, deserts, mountains, lakes, canyons, plains, and many more nuanced ecological systems take center stage in the winners’ striking images.\nA panel of judges chose three winners, with the first place award of Landscape Photographer of the Year presented to J. Fritz Rumpf, followed closely by Nienartowicz and Joyce Bealer. Another category commended specific photographs, with Lukas Trixl’s ethereal capture of New Plymouth, New Zealand, taking the top spot.\nIn total, a pool of 101 photographs made the cut for publication in the competition’s annual book, a further 101 of which can be viewed in the online gallery.\nEnrico Raimondo (Italy), “From the cold age,” Capracotta, Molise, Italy\nDennis Hualong Zhang (Armenia), “Supercell,” New Mexico\nJ.

As part of a three-year investigation that will inform upcoming restoration work, archaeologists discovered 60 flint flakes they believe were used as tools around 4,300 BCE during the Mesolithic or early Neolithic period. The archaeologists also uncovered additional items, including 800-year-old footwear and a 19th-century beer jug. The group noted that the flint artifacts predate Stonehenge's earliest earthworks by 1,000 years. At Stonehenge, flint tools are believed to have been used to chip and shape stone. The flint artifacts, said the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority in a press release, originated from the now-gone Thorney Island, formed by the once intersecting Thames and River Tyburn. Prehistoric people, archaeologists said, used that island stretch for fishing, hunting, and food gathering. The objects were discovered in the Cromwell Green section of the property.Flint artifacts believed to be 6,000 years old (image courtesy Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority)The discovery comes as parliament weighs costly options for the much-needed restoration of the building. Parliament was expected to vote on a final plan for the restoration of the palace later this year, but the process appears to be delayed again as members contend with a multibillion-pound price tag on the renewal. Proponents for urgent restoration caution against increasing fire risk to the building as it ages. Over the last decade, there were a reported 44 fires in the building. Judith Cummins MP, Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority board chair, said in a statement that the discovery came as part of inquiries into the building's history as it prepares for a major renovation \"to understand more about the building and the thousands of years of history underneath the home of Parliament.\" Nine areas of the Westminster campus are subject to the investigations, including the Royal Court, Speaker’s Court, and the Thames River shoreline. The discovery comes ahead of an expected restoration of the historic palace.\"It is vital we continue these investigations to understand what lies beneath the ground here at an early stage to inform and guide decisions on design and further surveys ahead of future enabling and construction works,\" Diane Abrams, the lead archaeologist for the investigations, said in a statement. \"This ensures the site’s extraordinary heritage and archaeology is managed appropriately while enabling the safe and efficient delivery of the Restoration and Renewal Programme.”Earlier this year, archaeologists at the site uncovered part of a medieval two-story hall from 1167, believed to have burnt completely in the 19th century, which once served as a dining area and as the Court of Chancery, the Court of Requests, and for parliamentary functions. In a statement, the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority said this previous discovery had been the most important of the group's work to date.The investigations will carry on through 2026, and a final report on the group's findings will be released in 2027.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

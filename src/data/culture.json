    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMichael Jack­son’s Thriller is the best-sell­ing album of all time, and not by a par­tic­u­lar­ly slim mar­gin. The most recent fig­ures have it reg­is­tered at 51.3 mil­lion copies, as against the 31.2 mil­lion notched by the run­ner up, AC/DC’s Back in Black. But it would sure­ly be a clos­er call with­out the title song’s cel­e­brat­ed music video, thir­teen John Lan­dis-direct­ed min­utes full of not just singing and danc­ing, but also clas­sic-style Hol­ly­wood mon­sters, some of them doing that singing and danc­ing them­selves. Hal­loween night is, of course, the best time to revis­it Michael Jack­son’s Thriller, as it’s offi­cial­ly titled. This year, why not chase it with the behind-the-scenes doc­u­men­tary below, Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller?\nYounger fans may not know that “Thriller” was­n’t even released as a sin­gle until Novem­ber of 1983: about a year after the album itself, which had already spun off six songs, includ­ing enor­mous hits like “Bil­lie Jean” and “Beat It.” In fact, Jack­son’s unprece­dent­ed vision for the album had been that every song could be a hit, with no filler in between.\nThe high­er-ups at Epic Records felt that its pop­u­lar­i­ty, how­ev­er sen­sa­tion­al to that point, had just about run its course. That made them unwill­ing, at first, to put out “Thriller” on its own, as did the song’s campy scary-movie lyrics, sound effects, and “rap” by none oth­er than Vin­cent Price, the embod­i­ment of old-Hol­ly­wood hor­ror. (This sort of thing was­n’t with­out prece­dent: with his sib­lings, Jack­son had cre­at­ed a sim­i­lar spooky atmos­phere in “This Place Hotel,” from 1980.)\n\n\n\t\n\nStill, at that point in his rise to the kind of fame no cul­tur­al fig­ure may ever know again, Jack­son under­stood much that the old guard did­n’t. He knew that “Thriller” could suc­ceed, not just as a song on the radio, but a mul­ti­me­dia cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­non. It would, of course, need a music video, but not one that mere­ly met the (still fair­ly lax) stan­dards of MTV. Impressed by the hor­ror, com­e­dy, and visu­al effects of John Lan­dis’ An Amer­i­can Were­wolf in Lon­don, Jack­son called up Lan­dis and asked him to direct what he’d been envi­sion­ing for “Thriller” at fea­ture-film pro­duc­tion val­ues. The $500,000 bud­get came from tele­vi­sion net­works like MTV and Show­time, offi­cial­ly for broad­cast­ing rights to Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller.\nThe doc­u­men­tary cap­tures var­i­ous aspects of the video’s cre­ation, from cast­ing to chore­og­ra­phy to shoot­ing to make­up, that last being an espe­cial­ly painstak­ing process over­seen by indus­try mas­ter Rick Bak­er. What­ev­er the rig­ors of the pro­duc­tion, Jack­son dis­plays undis­guised enjoy­ment of it all in this footage, per­haps fore­see­ing that it would cul­mi­nate in the kind of expres­sion that could come from no oth­er artist. Though an intense­ly col­lab­o­ra­tive effort, Michael Jack­son’s Thriller is true to its name in ulti­mate­ly being the prod­uct of a sin­gle, guid­ing per­for­ma­tive sen­si­bil­i­ty, some­how both uni­ver­sal­ly appeal­ing and high­ly idio­syn­crat­ic at the same time. Jack­son’s insis­tence on call­ing his music videos “short films” may have been regard­ed as a typ­i­cal eccen­tric­i­ty, but nev­er was the label more appro­pri­ate than when he brought back the old-school mon­ster movie one last, funky time.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” Video Changed Pop Cul­ture For­ev­er: Revis­it the 13-Minute Short Film Direct­ed by John Lan­dis\nHear “Starlight,” Michael Jackson’s Ear­ly Demo of “Thriller”: A Ver­sion Before the Lyrics Were Rad­i­cal­ly Changed\nWhen Mar­tin Scors­ese Direct­ed Michael Jack­son in the 18-Minute “Bad” Music Video & Paid Cin­e­mat­ic Trib­ute to West Side Sto­ry (1986)\nHow Michael Jack­son Wrote a Song: A Close Look at How the King of Pop Craft­ed “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough”\nJohn Lan­dis Decon­structs Trail­ers of Great 20th Cen­tu­ry Films: Cit­i­zen Kane, Sun­set Boule­vard, 2001 & More\nWhere Zom­bies Come From: A Video Essay on the Ori­gin of the Hor­ri­fy­ing, Satir­i­cal Mon­sters\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Literature |   \tOctober 31st, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOf the many read­ings and adap­ta­tions of Edgar Allan Poe’s clas­sic moody-broody poem “The Raven,” none is more fun than The Simp­sons’, in which Lisa Simpson’s intro tran­si­tions into the read­ing voice of James Earl Jones and the slap­stick inter­jec­tions of Homer as Poe’s avatar and Bart as the tit­u­lar bird. Jones’ solo read­ing of the poem is not to be missed and exists in sev­er­al ver­sions on YouTube.\nBut Jones is not the only clas­si­cal­ly creepy actor to have mas­tered Poe’s dic­tion. Above, we have Christo­pher Walken, whose unset­tling weird­ness is always tinged with a cer­tain wry humor, per­haps an effect of his clas­si­cal New York accent.\nAccom­pa­ny­ing Walken’s read­ing are the stan­dard eerie wind sounds and the unusu­al addi­tion of some dis­tort­ed met­al gui­tar: per­haps an intru­sion, per­haps a unique dra­mat­ic effect. The visu­al com­po­nent, a mon­tage of expres­sive pen­cil draw­ings, also may or may not work for you.\n\n\n\t\n\nYou may wish to con­trast this pro­duc­tion with what may be the locus clas­si­cus for tele­vi­su­al inter­pre­ta­tions of “The Raven.” Of course I mean the ham­my Vin­cent Price read­ing (above), which lent so much aes­thet­i­cal­ly to The Simp­sons par­o­dy. One of my favorite lit­tle in-jokes in the lat­ter occurs dur­ing Bart and Lisa’s intro­duc­tion. Bart whines, “that looks like a school-book!” and Lisa replies, “don’t wor­ry, Bart. You won’t learn any­thing.”\nLisa’s rejoin­der is a sly ref­er­ence to Poe’s con­tempt for lit­er­a­ture meant to instruct or mor­al­ize, a ten­den­cy he called “the heresy of the Didac­tic.” Poe’s the­o­ry and prac­tice grew out of his desire that lit­er­a­ture have a “uni­ty of effect,” that it pro­duce an aes­thet­ic expe­ri­ence sole­ly through the author’s skill­ful use of lit­er­ary form. Poe may have antic­i­pat­ed and direct­ly influ­enced the French sym­bol­ists and oth­er aes­thetes like Oscar Wilde, but his assured place in high cul­ture has thank­ful­ly not got­ten in the way of pop appro­pri­a­tions of his more odd­ball tales, like “The Raven.” A peren­ni­al favorite read­ing of the poem is clas­sic hor­ror actor Christo­pher Lee’s (below), which may be the most straight­for­ward­ly creepy of them all.\n\n\n\t\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEdgar Allan Poe’s the Raven: Watch an Award-Win­ning Short Film That Mod­ern­izes Poe’s Clas­sic Tale\nÉdouard Manet Illus­trates Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven, in a French Edi­tion Trans­lat­ed by Stephane Mal­lar­mé (1875)\nHear Lou Reed’s The Raven, a Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe Fea­tur­ing David Bowie, Ornette Cole­man, Willem Dafoe & More\nThe Grate­ful Dead Pays Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” in a 1982 Con­cert: Hear “Raven Space”\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThroughout her practice, Renée Condo draws on the philosophical tenets of her Mi’gmaq ancestry. The Montreal-based artist works with wooden beads that she sands, paints in bold acrylic, and nests into energetic compositions depicting juicy fruits, raindrops, and brilliant, golden suns.\nCondo is interested in mntu, or spirit, and what she refers to as heart knowledge, acts that emerge from empathy and love. Through sculptural pieces that emphasize interconnection and flow, the artist draws on Indigenous creation stories and myths, considering her beadwork a reimagining of various traditions.\n“Giju'” (2024), wood beads, acrylic paint, epoxy on wood panel, 72 × 60 inches\nCondo often engages the relationship between the component and composition, emphasizing the ways in which a singular piece would appear abstract without a broader context. “The bead as fundamental entity, as infinite potentiality, can appear as divided, as unit, as part,” she says, “but is at once whole and all-encompassing, holding secrets of the world and to the nature of reality.”\nThis fall, Condo will have work on view at GAVLAK, where she’s represented.

Built by architects and amateurs alike, each dwelling is varied in material, layout, purpose, and aesthetic, although all thrive because of their proximity to nature’s beauty.\n“Modern tree houses are proof that happiness doesn’t have to be built big—just built right,” author Florian Siebeck says, presenting an array of spaces from luxurious escapes to children’s hideouts.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCaledonia Curry’s story of the Sibylant Sisters starts like many others in the fairytale genre, although it takes just a few words to realize that something is off: “Once upon a swampy ol’ dirt road, two sisters, Caelum and Terra, were growing up under the care of a spindly little witch by the name of Katarina.” The narrative continues with the sorcerous mother beginning to unravel, prompting the siblings to rely on the younger Caelum’s magical powers to survive.\n“This story is drawn from my own childhood growing up at the end of a dirt road with a mother who was in the midst of a psychotic breakdown, and a lifetime spent teasing out the relationship between creativity, intuition, magic, and madness,” the artist says.\n\n\n\nCurry, who’s better known as Swoon (previously), has taken a sort of narrative turn in her practice as of late, translating her interest in family and intergenerational trauma into a sprawling, mythical tale. Seven years in the making, the project is multi-disciplinary and spans sculpture, installation, costume, film, and more. Many of the works can be seen in a four-part read-aloud, and they’ve also spawned an 88-card deck called “The Oracle of the Sibylants,” complete with symbolic imagery distinct to the artist’s practice.\nIncluded are renderings common in divination, including stars and smoking cauldrons, along with more idiosyncratic objects like a glowing Skee Ball machine and flailing garden hose. “Suffused with joy and tenderness amidst the hardship, these cards speak the language of fairytale, because there are some truths that can only be told by witches and unicorns, ogres and toads,” Swoon adds.\n“The Oracle of the Sibylants” is currently funding on Kickstarter, which features a video glimpsing some of the live-action and animated films to come. Stay up to date with the entire project—which Swoon envisions as a traveling exhibition, films, novella, and theatrical production—on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Curated by Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath (Directors of Hamburger Bahnhof – Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart, Berlin), the exhibition brings together about 150 works by 72 artists from 37 cities, featuring 34 new commissions and site-specific installations spanning painting, sculpture, film, photography, and performance. \nWhispers on the Horizon explores yearning as an enduring human drive that reaches beyond the possible, speaking of the future through quiet insistence rather than proclamation. Its conceptual framework centers on three modest yet charged objects drawn from Taiwan’s literary and cinematic works — absent from the galleries but shaping the exhibition’s emotional and temporal arc. The puppet from Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s The Puppetmaster (1993) embodies perseverance through eras of occupation and renewal; the diary in Chen Yingzhen’s My Kid Brother Kangxiong (1960) captures a generation’s struggle between conviction and disillusion; and the bicycle in Wu Ming-Yi’s The Stolen Bicycle (2015) evokes loss, inheritance, and belonging. Together, they form an invisible architecture for the Biennial: the puppet as continuity, the diary as interiority, and the bicycle as pursuit — three intertwined expressions of yearning.\nThe Biennial weaves contemporary works with around 30 pieces from the Taipei Fine Arts Museum’s collection. In dialogue with the new art, these collection pieces act not as static artifacts but as living agents of yearning, bridging past and present to foster intergenerational conversation. Suspended textile partitions replace solid walls in an echo of the exhibitions themes, creating permeable thresholds and open sightlines that foster a rhythm of visibility and connection. \n“We want to create a Biennial that could only exist here — one that listens to the histories, languages, and contradictions that make Taipei what it is. Our dialogue with TFAM’s collection was not an act of nostalgia but of grounding: an insistence that the local, when deeply engaged, becomes a lens for the world. In Whispers on the Horizon, yearning is that bridge — it begins in the intimacy of memory and extends into a shared horizon where the local turns universal,” said Bardaouil and Fellrath.\nExhibition Highlights\nThe ground floor features works devoted to craft, memory, and care as acts of survival, including Ciou Zih-Yan’s “Fake Airfield” (2025), which reconstructs a decoy airstrip from the Japanese colonial era. Also on view are “Out in the Fields” (1934) by Chen Chin, whose paintings of elegant women came to symbolize a Taiwan in search of its identity, and Afra Al Dhaheri’s “Weighted PAUSE” (2025), in which meditative looped rope arrangements invite viewers to contemplate slowness as a form of resistance.\nThe basement level centers on the body as both witness and vessel of transformation. Through rhythmically crushed stone and glass vessels, Ivana Bašić shapes the act of breathing into sculpture in “Passion of Pneumatics” (2020–24) and “Metanoia” (2025). A 1956 photograph by the late Syu Ching-Pwo, “Confidence,” captures two men leaning close in conversation, separating and connecting at once, while Jacky Connolly’s “The Mineral Kingdom (Dark Green)” (2025) uses dreamlike imagery to merge memory with virtual terrain, turning personal grief into digital landscapes.\nOn the upper level, the works trace an artistic lineage driven by the desire to perceive, interpret, and connect — collectively reimagining the world through the lens of yearning. Liu Kuo-Sung breaks from traditional ink painting to develop new abstract forms in “Floating Mountain” (1971) as Eva Jospin constructs a mirrored forest in “Ici” (2025), inspired by the classical Huang Gongwang painting “Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains” (1348–50). With “Skeleton” (2025), P. Staff turns the gallery into an exploration of control and resistance, layering infrared imagery and poetic narration to examine how bodies are regulated and liberated.\nLi-chen Loh, Director of the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, remarks: “Since its inception, the Taipei Biennial has embraced diversity of voices. This edition reflects on the ties between local experience and global context, inviting visitors to reconsider their place in an interconnected world.”\nFor more information, visit taipeibiennial.org/2025 or follow TFAM’s Facebook and Instagram.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

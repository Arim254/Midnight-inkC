    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne of the top comments on a new video from the Victoria and Albert Museum reads as follows: “I think it is time to have a renaissance of mourning. In this age of sanitized and hidden grief, it would be a welcomed relief for a more refined mourning experience.”\nThis commenter is responding to two V&A curators unboxing a collection of 19th-century objects common in Victorian mourning traditions. Through a variety of garments, ephemera, and photos, the pair showcases the elaborate rituals and rites people once used to honor the dead.\n\n\n\nThe video highlights a black, silk gown with tiny pleats, delicate lace, and sequins, along with jewelry made from semi-precious jet stones, and brooches containing human hair. The curators also present several printed artifacts, like mourning cards and portraits of the dying.\nWhat becomes clear throughout the video is how much our contemporary culture of grief and loss has turned inward and is something managed privately rather than shared with a community. “Mourning objects can be personal, portable, ostentatious, sentimental, or even a little bit grizzly,” the curators add. “Is it too much? Or do you think we should mourn the passing of these poignant and fascinating trappings of grief?”\nFind the unboxing on YouTube, along with several additional adventures in the museum’s collections.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMIAMI BEACH — For the third year in a row, a coalition of Miami artists and activists met at City Hall near the Miami Beach Convention Center today, December 6, on the busy Saturday of Art Basel to raise their voices and handmade signs in protest of the event’s ties to the genocide in Gaza. This time, the advocacy group Artists 4 Artists also joined the action to call for a boycott of the next edition of the fair in 2026, citing the event's impact on both the environment and the local arts community. After being relocated from the front of the Convention Center last year by dozens of Miami Beach police officers, several of the organizers are involved in ongoing litigation with the city of Miami Beach over what they allege are violations of their free speech. Chanting from the grass in front of City Hall within view of the fair entrance, dozens of protestors spoke with passing fairgoers peacefully about Israel’s ongoing violence in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank despite a ceasefire.The action brought together members of Artists 4 Artists and Jewish Voice for Peace. (photo courtesy A4A:MIA)Watched by a police sniper on a nearby rooftop and three rented vans with screens on them that accused South Florida Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP) leaders of being antisemitic, organizers raised the “LET PALESTINE LIVE” banner that was sewn for Art Week in December 2023. They handed out leaflets that included QR codes linking to poetry and visual art by Mahmoud Darwish, Hazem Harb, and other Palestinian writers and artists. A spokesperson for Art Basel told Hyperallergic that the fair was “in close coordination with the City of Miami Beach and the Miami Beach Police Department to ensure that demonstrators were able to gather in the public area outside the venue, and that visitors could access the fair safely and without disruption.”Attendees flagged the presence of police and a sniper on a nearby rooftop. (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)Palestinian-American artist and activist Elias Rischmawi was approached several times by police officers who claimed handing out flyers on the sidewalk was not allowed. In an interview with Hyperallergic, Rischmawi pointed to the importance of de-centering this week and Art Basel in the close-knit Miami art scene. “It’s strange seeing our people on those trucks being vilified, because they are scared of us and we’re just coming from a place of love and commitment and trying to build bridges in our community,” Rischmawi said. “I think even just people seeing how we are happy and all together and in true community outside of a money-centered event like this is valuable.”Rischmawi is organizing an exhibition at the Boom Box in Miami next week called Beyond Home, which will use the form of a tent to consider displacement in both a Floridian and international context and feature Palestinian and immigrant artists. Dozens gathered near City Hall in Miami Beach. (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)In speeches, JVP leaders pointed to Art Basel sponsor UBS’s investment in Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems as the primary reason for this year’s demonstration. Miami-Dade County has also invested a reported $151 million in Israeli bonds. Meanwhile, Miami Artists 4 Artists organizers misael soto and johann c. muñoz-tapasco urged people to boycott Art Basel and its associated events next year.“These fairs come here and extract the labor of gig workers, extract the cultural nuances and energies that the city has to offer, and turn that into a profit that none of us see,” muñoz-tapasco explained, pointing to the intersectionality of Palestine with the larger rise of fascism and censorship in Florida under the Republican-led government. Police presence at the protest (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)“These institutions want our art, but they don’t want the people who make the art. They refuse to do things that will make the world safer for us, and are often complicit in the systems eroding our work,” muñoz-tabasco continued. “We’re not just in late stage capitalism, but in a kind of cognitive capitalism, where our artwork is feeding AI programs, from image to writing,\" they said. “We are in a position of advantage because we have the actual vision, which they want, but we are taught that we have to be a certain way to be anyone in the world of the arts.”The Art Basel spokesperson said the fair “remains deeply committed to the creative community in Greater Miami and to supporting the many Miami Beach– and Miami-based artists who participate in our show through their galleries.” UBS, the spokesperson added, is “Art Basel’s long-standing Global Lead Partner, and our collaboration is focused on supporting artists, galleries, and cultural programming across our shows worldwide.\"Artist Eddie Arroyo holds up his drawing of the police sniper. (photo Francess Archer Dunbar/Hyperallergic)Miami Artists 4 Artists was one of the organizers of an ongoing artists’ census, as well as an exhibition earlier this year called The Artist as Activist, which protested the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center in the Everglades. Recognizing that this week is an important source of income for South Florida artists and culture workers, they envision the boycott as a call in to locals and visitors, with exhibitions and programming that are artist- instead of industry-centric. As artist Eddie Arroyo sketched the police vans at the edge of the barricade, Jewish Miami resident Amanda Rose pointed to the religious resonance of looking towards the future. “There’s a saying many of us grew up hearing around Passover: ‘Next year in Jerusalem.’ And it was a subtle way of initiating us into Zionism. But there’s something very powerful about that thought, like projecting into the next year,” she shared in an interview with Hyperallergic. “Maybe next year we won’t have to be here. Maybe if we continue to say it, Palestine will be free.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tMartin Parr, a photographer known for pictures of tourists that were both genuinely curious explorations of their lifestyle and wry indictments of it, has died on December 6 at his home in Bristol, England. His death was announced on Sunday by the namesake foundation that he founded in Bristol in 2017.\n\n\tThough the foundation did not specify a cause, Parr was diagnosed with myeloma, a form of bone marrow cancer, in 2021. The Guardian reported this year that he was in remission, but that he was still taking chemotherapy tablets.\n\n\t“The Martin Parr Foundation and Magnum Photos will work together to preserve and share Martin’s legacy,” the foundation said in a statement. “More information on this will follow in due course.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tParr was among the most famous photographers of his generation. Know best for his pictures of sunbathers and sightseers, he published countless photobooks and did fashion shoots for Vogue, Gucci, and various other brands.\n\n\tThough his subjects varied widely, Parr’s photography was always characterized by a certain crassness and a fascination with “low” culture. Depending on how you looked at his work, it was either unironically interested in its subjects or shrewdly critical of them. \n\n\tFrom either perspective, the politics of his art was always opaque, which is one reason it could be seen from so many angles. Parr will next year be the subject of a retrospective at the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris that is themed around how he pictured climate change and overtourism. (Parr claimed that French audiences were always more receptive to his work than British ones, telling the Guardian, “they love photography more, they buy prints, they review shows.”)\n\n\tHe remains most famous for his 1983–85 series “The Last Resort,” for which Parr shot bathers at New Brighton Beach in England. In one image, a bathers is flopped out on the sand behind a dirtied tractor, without a clean view of the nearby water; in another, a tanning mother looks away from her crying baby, who gets more sun than she does. Both pictures seem to image a culture in thrall to the notion of relaxation, its people distanced from the possibility of actually reaching tranquility during their spare time. Upon its exhibition in 1986 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, Parr became a star.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGB. England. Salford. Spending Time. 1986.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMartin Parr\n\t\n\n\n\n\tParr continued that theme with his 1987–94 series “Small World,” in which he shot massed groups of sightseers in foreign locales, doing anything but looking at the sights they came to see. One beloved image, shot in front of the Tower of Pisa, shows people sticking up their hands, pretending to hold up the structure for a photo op. Those people have notably turned their backs to the structure itself, which dominates the picture. “Tourism is the biggest industry in the world,” Parr told the New Yorker. “I’m interested in the great conundrum, the contradiction between the mythology of these places and the reality.”\n\n\tSeries like “Small World” were notably divisive upon their debut. In his 2025 autobiography, Parr recalled that when “Small World” was first exhibited, Henri Cartier-Bresson, the modernist whose pictures defined an entire branch of modernist photography, told the artist that it was out of this world—in a bad way. Parr then told him: “I acknowledge that there is a large gap between your celebration of life and my implied criticism of it.” He continued, “What I would query with you is, ‘Why shoot the messenger?’”\n\n\tMartin Parr was born in 1952 in Surrey, England. He developed a love of photography early on, thanks in part to his grandfather, who taught him how to use a camera, and found himself on track for an art career when he flunked out of key school topics. He attended Manchester Polytechnic, the only school that accepted him.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMartin Parr, Venice, Italy, 2005.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© Martin Parr/Magnum Photos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tParr moved to Hebden Bridge, where he met Susan Mitchell, whom he later married. (They had one daughter, Ellen Parr, who survives him.) He started out shooting chapels before he and his wife moved to Ireland, where Parr continued to work mainly in black and white.\n\n\tThen, once they moved to Wallasey, he transitioned to color, a mode that was still considered déclassé in photography, even as Americans such as Stephen Shore, Joel Meyerowitz, and William Eggleston had begun to show during the ’70s that it could be used artistically. While “The Last Resort” is relatively restrained in its color palette, later works would embrace sharper hues that only heightened the strangeness of his work.\n\n\tParr began shooting fashion photography in 1999 at the invitation of Amica, an Italian magazine. Many of his fashion photographs were notably not shot in a studio but in supermarkets, museums, and other sites. “For me, getting out in the real world, trying to make a real plausible picture that works, that looks interesting is the challenge and that’s what I’ve basically done,” Parr told Aperture ahead of his 2024 book Fashion Faux Parr. “I don’t think there’s any shots in the studio at all here. It’s all in the outside world.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMartin Parr, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 2007.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t©Martin Parr/Magnum Photos\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThroughout his career, his work moved fluidly across multiple industries. He joined Magnum, a leading photography collective known mainly for its documentary output, in 1994 and later became its president, running it from 2013 to 2017. He also regularly showed in art museums, with retrospectives staged at the Barbican Centre in London and the Haus der Kunst in Munich.\n\n\tHe remained active into the later stages of his career, even as he battled cancer. He continued devoting much attention to his foundation, which runs a gallery and has provided to emerging photographers. “Hopefully it will be of some benefit,” he told the Guardian of his foundation. “I’m not going to say I’m saving the world. I never expect photography to change anything.” \n",

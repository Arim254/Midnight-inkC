    "body": "\n\tin Life, Philosophy |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEach cul­ture has its own say­ings about the unique­ness and tran­sience of the present moment. In recent years, the Eng­lish-speak­ers have often found them­selves remind­ed, through the expres­sion “YOLO,” that they only live once. (The ques­tion of whether that should real­ly be “YLOO,” or “You Live Only Once,” we put aside for the time being.) In Japan, unsur­pris­ing­ly, one some­times hears a much more ven­er­a­ble equiv­a­lent: “ichi-go ichi‑e,” which some read­ers acquaint­ed with the Japan­ese lan­guage should be assured has noth­ing to do with straw­ber­ries, ichi­go. Rather, the say­ing’s under­ly­ing Chi­nese char­ac­ters (一期一会) can be trans­lat­ed as “one time, one meet­ing.”\nThe Bud­dhis­ti­cal­ly inflect­ed “ichi-go ichi‑e” is just one in the vast library of yoji­juku­go, high­ly con­densed apho­ris­tic expres­sions writ­ten with just four char­ac­ters. (Oth­er coun­tries with Chi­nese-influ­enced lan­guages have their ver­sions, includ­ing sajaseon­geo in Korea and chéngyǔ in Chi­na itself.) It descends, as the sto­ry goes, from a slight­ly longer say­ing favored by the six­teenth-cen­tu­ry tea mas­ter Sen no Rikyū, “ichi-go ni ichi-do” (一期に一度).\nOne must pay respects to the host of a tea cer­e­mo­ny because the meet­ing would only ever occur once — which, of course, it would, even if the cer­e­mo­ny was a reg­u­lar­ly sched­uled event. For we nev­er, to bor­row an ancient Greek take on this whole sub­ject, step into the same riv­er twice; no two events, sep­a­rat­ed in time, can ever tru­ly be iden­ti­cal.\n\n\n\t\n\nOne impli­ca­tion, as not­ed in the explana­to­ry videos above from the BBC and Einzel­gänger, is that we should savor what­ev­er moment we hap­pen to find our­selves in, how­ev­er imper­fect, because we won’t get a sec­ond chance to do so. And if it offers lit­tle or noth­ing to enjoy, we can find solace in the fact that its par­tic­u­lar dis­plea­sure, too, can nev­er revis­it us. With the past gone and the future nev­er guar­an­teed, the present moment, in any case, is the only time that actu­al­ly exists for us, so we’d bet­ter make our­selves com­fort­able with­in it. Though these ideas have per­haps found their most ele­gant and mem­o­rable expres­sion in Japan, they’re hard­ly con­sid­ered exclu­sive cul­tur­al prop­er­ty there.

    "body": "\n\tin Audio Books, Literature |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHav­ing not revis­it­ed The Hob­bit in some time, I’ve felt the famil­iar pull—shared by many readers—to return to Tolkien’s fairy-tale nov­el itself. It was my first expo­sure to Tolkien, and the per­fect book for a young read­er ready to dive into moral com­plex­i­ty and a ful­ly-real­ized fic­tion­al world.\nAnd what bet­ter guide could there be through The Hob­bit than Tolkien him­self, read­ing (above) from the 1937 work? In this 1952 record­ing in two parts (part 2 is below), the ven­er­a­ble fan­ta­sist and schol­ar reads from his own work for the first time on tape.\nTolkien begins with a pas­sage that first describes the crea­ture Gol­lum; lis­ten­ing to this descrip­tion again, I am struck by how much dif­fer­ent­ly I imag­ined him when I first read the book. The Gol­lum of The Hob­bit seems some­how hoari­er and more mon­strous than many lat­er visu­al inter­pre­ta­tions. This is a minor point and not a crit­i­cism, but per­haps a com­ment on how nec­es­sary it is to return to the source of a myth­ic world as rich as Tolkien’s, even, or espe­cial­ly, when it’s been so well-real­ized in oth­er media. No one, after all, knows Mid­dle Earth bet­ter than its cre­ator.\n\n\n\t\n\nThese read­ings were part of a much longer record­ing ses­sion, dur­ing which Tolkien also read (and sang!) exten­sive­ly from The Lord of the Rings. A YouTube user has col­lect­ed, in sev­er­al parts, a radio broad­cast of that full ses­sion, and it’s cer­tain­ly worth your time to lis­ten to it all the way through. It’s also worth know­ing the neat con­text of the record­ing. Here’s the text that accom­pa­nies the video on YouTube:\nWhen Tolkien vis­it­ed a friend in August of 1952 to retrieve a man­u­script of The Lord of the Rings, he was shown a “tape recorder”. Hav­ing nev­er seen one before, he asked how it worked and was then delight­ed to have his voice record­ed and hear him­self played back for the first time. His friend then asked him to read from The Hob­bit, and Tolkien did so in this one incred­i­ble take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2012.\nRelat­ed Con­tent\nLis­ten to J.R.R.

More than 600 artists have benefited from this celebrated artist residency since its beginning in 1974.\nKohler Co. will host four artists at a time for the three-month residency: Within each cohort, two residents work in the Kohler Co. Pottery and two in the Foundry. Advance experience working with clay or metal is not required — artists must simply have an interest in adapting industrial processes to their practice. \nArts/Industry artist-in-residence Nirmal Raja in the Kohler Co. Foundry. \nIn addition to 24/7 studio access, residents receive free industrial materials, use of equipment, technical support, photographic services, housing, round-trip transportation, and a monthly honorarium. Artists may choose to work in the Pottery or Foundry.\nArts/Industry is a collaboration between the John Michael Kohler Arts Center, a nonprofit arts organization in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and Kohler Co., the global kitchen and bath manufacturing company headquartered in nearby Kohler, Wisconsin. The program is funded by both JMKAC and Kohler. \nThe deadline to apply for the 2027 residency is February 28, 2026.\nFor program details and application guidelines, visit jmkac.org/applications.\nArts/Industry artist-in-residence Erin Smith in the Kohler Co.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nTopped with a roof shaped like a crabshell, Le Corbusier’s Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut is a sanctuary amid the French mountainside. The 1955 construction rests atop a hill in Ronchamp, standing unobstructed by the otherwise forested inclines. As the sun rises and falls, light filters in through the mélange of rectangular windows tinted to cast streams of color around the space.\nThe stained glass apertures of Le Corbusier’s modernist chapel are a clear reference point for Luftwerk’s “Open Frame.” The site-specific work fills a cavernous corner of Secrist | Beach with a collection of rectangular aluminum panels painted with acrylic and, most notably, fluorescent. Where the pioneering architect sought a natural backlight in the sun, Luftwerk relies on the properties of the paint to achieve a luminous glow. The only external source is a handful of strategically placed LED spotlights that bathe the entire installation in purple when in use.\nDetail of “Open Frame”\n“Open Frame” is one of the many pieces in the artists’ latest exhibition that extends their unyielding interest in light and color. The Sun Standing Still features a collection of sculptures and installations that harness the principles of color theory, explore space, and elicit various sensory experiences. The artists, Chicago-based Petra Bachmaier and Sean Gallero (previously), draw on the characteristics of sunlight as it broaches the horizon, cultivating a body of work that conjures luminosity through negative space and pigment.\nLong interested in perspective, Luftwerk presents several works that appear dramatically different depending on the viewer’s position. The Solargraph series, for example, references the long-duration images that capture the sun’s path between solstices. Stretching across the gallery, these works incorporate skinny, aluminum strips painted white on one side and bisected by various hues on the inverse. As the viewer moves, so does the perception of the piece, revealing an expanse of faintly tinted white before shifting to a bright arc of color.\nRelatedly, the freestanding Aperture of Twilight sculptures place five panels cut with differently sized openings eight inches apart. Painted on one side, the layers form a sort of portal or entrance, inviting a closer look. The circular Aurae Quartet pieces function similarly as they utilize concentric rings to capture a sense of movement inward or out.\nIf you’re in Chicago, you can see The Sun Standing Still through February 28. Find more from the artists on their website and Instagram.\n“Solargraph: Shortest Day” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 6 feet x 4.75 feet x 2 inches\n“Solargraph: Arc of Days” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 72 pieces, 6 feet x 27 feet x 6 inches\n“Aurae Quartet No. 1 ” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 33 inches in diameter, 3 inches in depth\n\n“Aurae Trio No. 1” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 26.375 inch diameter, 3 inches depth\nInstallation view of ‘The Sun Standing Still’\n“Aperture of Twilight: Dawn” (2025), aluminum and acrylic paint, 5 layers, 33 x 33 inches each\n“Open Frame” (2025), aluminum, acrylic, and fluorescent paint, size variable\n“Open Frame” (2025), aluminum, acrylic, and fluorescent paint, size variable\n“Color Space No. 3” (2025), glass with film, 13 x 13 x 13 inches, edition of 3\nThe artists in their studio.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom a single material, a Hyderabad-based design studio creates a wide range of site-specific installations, furnishings, and decor. It’s all in the name of the firm, The Wicker Story, which was founded in 2019 by architect Priyanka Narula. Capable of being formed into everything from abstract constructions to functional objects, the natural material lends itself a huge variety of pieces that vary in size and complexity.\nWicker is a common technique used for basket-weaving and other applications in India, and The Wicker Story evolved out of a fascination with the geometry and math inherent in traditional Indian pieces. The material and process nods to a time-honored aesthetic while emphasizing organic forms, fluidity, and experimentation.\n“Flowering Vines”\nA swirling plane descending from a light fixture, a bean-shaped bench, and a bulbous floor lamp are just a couple of The Wicker Story’s woven creations. Botanicals often provide reference points, as abstracted petals and vine-like tendrils often complement the compositions.\nAfter refining the possibilities of the technique, including colorful dyes and a range of forms, the studio is honing a core collection that will continue to mature and grow. “We are currently translating those traditional wicker techniques into metal weaving; it’s a rigorous research-and-development process that we look forward to debuting fully next year,” the studio says.\nSee more on The Wicker Story’s website and Instagram.\n“Bark Bench”\nTWS x Seraspire lighting feature collaboration\n“Bark Lamp”\n“Imli Bench”\n“Flower” installation\n“Bow Bench 1”\n“Sunset Beach”\n“Bloom”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe term “needlework” covers a wide variety of thread-based practices from sewing to knitting to lace-making. While some of these are functional, techniques like embroidery are often employed purely for their aesthetic qualities. From ornately stitched Japanese robes to regal, patterned belts in Central Africa’s Kuba kingdom, the time-honored medium is diverse with virtually endless applications.\nIn The Atlas of World Embroidery by Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood, forthcoming from Princeton University Press, a world of compositions made with needle and thread is compiled into a single volume.\nA belt for a Kuba king or immediate family, which has numerous small pendants, including ram’s heads, bells, and harps, all covered with glass beads and cowries. Image courtesy of Minneapolis Institute of Art, The Ethel Morrison Van Derlip Fund\nWhere there is fabric, there tends to be embroidery, whether in the form of ceremonial headdresses, badges, vestments, quilts, gowns, or myriad other items. Often combined with beads, shells, leather, and found objects, the practice fulfills a range of cultural, ritual, and personal purposes.\nEvery world region has its own interpretations and motifs, from Indigenous America to Europe to the Iranian Plateau. But there is also a rich amount of cross-pollination, highlighting how international trade and migration introduced different designs across cultures.\nEmphasizing the spectacular visual diversity of the art form, Vogelsang-Eastwood illuminates embroidery’s global history. The volume contains more than 300 images and thoroughly surveys its implementation and styles, with subsections devoted to individual countries, cultures, and the kinds of ornate needlework that characterize different regions.\nThe Atlas of World Embroidery is scheduled for release on February 17.

A man was taken into custody in Paris on Friday, January 2, after he was suspected of breaking off and stealing the sword from an equestrian sculpture of Joan of Arc at the Place Saint-Augustin in the city's 8th arrondissement in broad daylight. The sculpture, a bronze cast of Paul Dubois's original 19th-century rendition of the national heroine, depicts an armored Joan of Arc on horseback, holding her famous sword in the air. Karen Taïeb, the deputy mayor of Paris overseeing heritage, history, and religious relations, told French media outlet Le Parisien that CCTV footage of the incident shows the man “violently shaking the horse, before climbing the statue and breaking the sword with a snap using his bare hands.”The man reportedly made off with the sword, which broke into a few pieces, until a passing police patrol stopped him. Though the sword was recovered after the man's arrest, it remains to be seen whether the bronze weapon can be repaired or if it must be identically reproduced.The suspect will undergo a behavioral assessment, and the 8th arrondissement has filed a complaint in light of the incident, reports say.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Joan of Arc\n                      \n                      \n                        Paris\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

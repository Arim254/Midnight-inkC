    "body": "\n\tin Literature, Random |   \tDecember 19th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt was some­thing of a Christ­mas rit­u­al at Hunter S. Thomp­son’s Col­orado cab­in, Owl Farm. Every year, his sec­re­tary Deb­o­rah Fuller would take down the Christ­mas tree and leave it on the front porch rather than dis­pose of it entire­ly. That’s because Hunter, more often than not, want­ed to set it on fire. In 1990, Sam Allis, a writer for the then for­mi­da­ble TIME mag­a­zine, vis­it­ed Thomp­son’s home and watched the fiery tra­di­tion unfold. He wrote:\nI gave up on the inter­view and start­ed wor­ry­ing about my life when Hunter Thomp­son squirt­ed two cans of fire starter on the Christ­mas tree he was going to burn in his liv­ing-room fire­place, a few feet away from an unopened wood­en crate of 9‑mm bul­lets. That the tree was far too large to fit into the fire­place mat­tered not a whit to Hunter, who was sport­ing a dime-store wig at the time and resem­bled Tony Perkins in Psy­cho. Min­utes ear­li­er, he had smashed a Polaroid cam­era on the floor.\nHunter had decid­ed to video­tape the Christ­mas tree burn­ing, and we lat­er heard on the replay the ter­ri­fied voic­es of Deb­o­rah Fuller, his long­time sec­re­tary-baby sit­ter, and me off-cam­era plead­ing with him, “NO, HUNTER, NO! PLEASE, HUNTER, DON’T DO IT!” The orig­i­nal man­u­script of Hell’s Angels was on the table, and there were the bul­lets. Noth­ing doing. Thomp­son was a man pos­sessed by now, full of the Chivas Regal he had been slurp­ing straight from the bot­tle and the gin he had been mix­ing with pink lemon­ade for hours.\nThe wood­en man­tel above the fire­place appar­ent­ly still has burn marks on it today.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.

    "body": "\nAll images courtesy of Anthony Theakston, shared with permission\nDecember 19, 2025\n\n\nLincolnshire-based artist Anthony Theakston continues his explorations of common birds like barn owls and herons, sculpting their likeness in sleek bronze and ceramic. Smooth wings and bodies contrast the fluffy feathers typical of fowl, as they hunch over or curl up as if taking a nap. Elegant and seemingly primed for flight, the avians perch between abstract and realistic representations.\nTheakston has several exhibitions and fairs planned for 2026, including Naarden Art Fair and Brussels Affordable Art Fair with DeKunst Salon and the Washington Winter Show and Art Palm Beach with Gladwell and Patterson. He’s also represented by Gallery Bartoux, and you can find more of his work on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen considering Miguel Arzabe’s bold, woven works, it’s unsurprising that he begins by painting two abstract pieces. Vibrant fields of acrylic spread across his canvases before they’re sliced into long strips and reconfigured. Resulting are dynamic compositions that meld art historical traditions with Arzabe’s Bolivian heritage, drawing on longstanding Andean imagery and weaving practices.\nNext month at Johansson Projects, the Oakland-based artist presents a collection of new wall works and suspended sculptures in Sin Contar Cincuenta. Arzabe refers to his practice as offering a “productive confrontation” of distinct cultures, approaches, and periods, and these new compositions continue his explorations into imagining spaces where differences exist in harmony. \n“La Bahía de Niebla” (2025), woven acrylic on canvas, 48 x 60 inches\nThe artist often roots his work in place and connections to a particular environment, and several pieces evoke vast landscapes and weather. “La Bahía de Niebla,” for example, echoes the dense opacity of Bay Area fog, while the elongated form reminiscent of an atoll sprawls across “Isla del Lago.” \nSin Contar Cincuenta is on view from January 17 to March 21 in Oakland.

(photo via Wikimedia Commons, CC0 1.0 Universal)\n    \n        \n            A controversial monument to \"victims of communism\" in downtown Ottawa will no longer include the names of specific people after the Canadian government reportedly discovered potential Nazi affiliations among the commemorated individuals. The memorial, \"Canada, a Land of Refuge,\" originally proposed under conservative former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, was inaugurated last December by the government of Canada and Tribute to Liberty, an organization formed to build a monument honoring those \"affected by communism.\" Over 500 specific names were reportedly expected to be engraved on the memorial within a year of its unveiling, though Jewish groups and historians raised concerns for years that over half of the individuals could have been Nazi collaborators in the Holocaust. The monument's unveiling was delayed amid the controversy. This week, one year after the memorial's unveiling, the Department of Canadian Heritage said that it no longer planned to etch specific names into the memorial.“The Government of Canada has emphasized that all aspects of the Memorial to the Victims of Communism must align with Canadian values of democracy and human rights,” Caroline Czajkowski, a spokesperson for the Department of Canadian Heritage, told Hyperallergic in a statement. “The Wall of Remembrance will now solely feature thematic content that conveys the broader commemorative and educational intent of the Memorial.” When Hyperallergic asked Tribute to Liberty about reports that Nazi connections were discovered among the commemorated, the organization provided a statement alleging that \"Kremlin-aligned activists and commentators in Canada have relentlessly spread disinformation targeting Central and Eastern European diaspora communities.\"The monument comprises 4,000 metal rods designed by Paul Raff Studio, a central element of the memorial called the “Arc of Memory,” and is \"intended to express the vastness of people who suffered under communist regimes,\" according to the Department of Canadian Heritage.According to government records obtained by the Ottawa Citizen under freedom of information laws, the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a local Holocaust education organization, warned the Canadian government in 2021 that one individual whose name was to be included, Ukrainian nationalist Roman Shukhevych, was connected to the killings of Jews. Some names had already been engraved on the monument, including that of Janis Niedra, who was reportedly connected to a massacre of 350 Jews in Latvia. These names had been reportedly previously removed from the monument. Hyperallergic has contacted Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        ",

(photo courtesy NEA)\n    \n        \n            Political consultant Mary Anne Carter, who served as the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) during the first Trump administration, will lead the agency again following Senate approval this week. Carter's appointment comes almost a year after Maria Rosario Jackson, a former Biden-appointed chair of the agency, stepped down from the post one day after Trump was inaugurated for a second term. Jackson was the first African American and the first Mexican-American person to lead the federal arts agency. In the 11 months since Jackson stepped down, the NEA rescinded arts grants en masse, notifying awardees that their projects were cancelled as the agency refocused on promoting “skilled trade jobs,” “AI competency,” “support [for] the military and veterans.” The NEA also terminated a longstanding grant program, Challenge America, that was geared toward \"underserved communities.\" Senior officials within the NEA resigned in May amid the cuts. Trump had also threatened to eliminate the agency entirely in a budget proposal earlier this year. In September, the American Civil Liberties Union won a lawsuit it filed against the NEA for asking applicants to abstain from funding anything that could be considered to be \"gender ideology,\" as defined by the Trump administration.After Carter's first appointment in 2018, reporters pointed out that she had served on Trump's presidential inaugural committee. A public LinkedIn account also notes that she served as director for Republican Rick Scott's transition to governor in 2011, later becoming his office's chief policy advisor. Her LinkedIn also includes experiences as a radio talk show host and campaign strategist. Notably, in the 1990s, she worked for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, which helped shape Trump's Project 2025 far-right policy agenda. \"The arts are essential to creating, innovating, healing, and recovery, and they provide vital economic stability to communities across the nation,\" Carter said in a press release. \"I look forward to the many celebrations that will take place in 2026 in honor of America’s 250th anniversary, as well as to the agency’s continued research into the powerful role the arts play in healing—from illness to trauma to natural disasters.” There is no indication that Carter has any specific experience working in fields related to arts and culture, aside from her previous tenure at the NEA. When Jackson was appointed in 2021, she served as a tenured professor at Arizona State University’s Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts. Carter was first nominated to lead the NEA in May, but was not officially approved by the Senate until yesterday, December 18. Her approval comes as the board of the Kennedy Center for the Arts, which is chaired by Trump, voted to rename the Washington, DC, organization the “Trump-Kennedy Center.” Trump’s name was affixed to the center’s facade this morning. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

But while the exhibition offers a beautiful and instructive display of manuscript artistry, it risks presenting a sanitized vision of the book's history, one that glosses over the fundamental power dynamics and conflicts inherent in medieval religious life. By framing these \"gloriously illuminated\" Psalters as impacting Medieval men and women in general, the exhibition risks creating the illusion of widespread engagement and access. In reality, these breathtakingly expensive manuscripts were tools of the elite.The Book of Psalms (often called “Psalms\" or the “Psalter”) is a central book in the Jewish Bible (Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament. At its core, it is an anthology of 150 sacred Hebrew poems, songs, and prayers that were originally set to music for use in temple worship and often attributed to King David, though there were many authors. The English term “Psalms” derives from the Greek word psalmoi, which originally meant “songs sung to stringed instruments.” In the Jewish tradition, the book is called Tehillim (meaning “Praises”).The text is therefore a shared inheritance between Judaism and Christianity. However, as the introduction to the exhibition implies, the interpretative framework between the two is fundamentally different. The Christian approach is predominantly framed around Christ himself, viewing the Psalms as Messianic prophecies that prefigure His life, suffering, and triumph — a lens sharply different from the traditional Jewish focus on their original liturgical and historical context. Ingeborg Psalter Workshop, \"God Commanding Adam\" and \"River of Paradise Psalms\" in Latin with interlinear French translation and French commentary of Simon de Tournai (c. 1200) (photo by Janny Chiu)The exhibition attempts to bridge this difference by organizing its impressive selection of manuscripts, printed texts, and devotional objects across five thematic sections. The first, “Translating the Psalms” highlights the movement of the Psalter into diverse languages (Latin, Greek, Middle English, Amharic, Hebrew and Aramaic), ostensibly focused on how communities with linguistic differences adopted the text. “Teaching the Psalms\" explores the Psalter's role in monastic and clerical learning across Europe, including commentaries and liturgical books. Here, the inclusion of texts associated with noblewomen — such as a French commentary from Belgium (c. 1200) by Simon de Tournai written for the noblewoman Laurette d’Alsace, daughter of Count Thierry of Flanders — attempts to frame the Psalter as a gateway to female literacy and learning under the misleading heading “Women and Learning.”The section “Illuminating the Psalms” showcases lavishly decorated Psalters, including famous “greatest hits” like the Eadwine Psalter from Canterbury, England (c. 1155–60) and the Lewis Psalter from Paris (c. 1225–30), emphasizing the artistic tradition of medieval manuscripts. “Performing the Psalms” considers how the large, unadorned choir books — or Antiphonaries, mostly from parts of Italy — were used in daily monastic or clerical offices. Finally, “Using the Psalms” concludes by examining the Psalter’s secondary functions, such as the warding off of evil, illustrated by objects like a fascinating amulet prayer scroll in Greek and Arabic from Trebizond, in the Byzantine Empire (c. 14th century). Unknown maker(s), \"Life of Christ\" (1155–60) from the Eadwine Psalter, England, Canterbury (photo by Graham S. Haber)But while these books are certainly beautiful and instructive, presenting them as impacting the ordinary “men and women in medieval Europe” is inaccurate. The aforementioned Lewis Psalter and similar examples were not tools for the \"everyday spiritual life of the peasant,\" as the curators suggest in the wall text. They were commissioned by the nobility and royalty. Their construction required enormous resources — hundreds of animal skins for the vellum, the labor of multiple specialized artisans (scribes, illuminators, binders), and costly pigments like ultramarine (lapis lazuli), which was often more expensive than gold. The educational value of the Psalter for the vast majority was limited to rote, catechetical instruction — they were not a gateway to broader literacy or social mobility. By emphasizing these lavish objects, the exhibition becomes more a celebration of aristocratic patronage and clerical control than a true reflection of average medieval spirituality.The section “Translating the Psalms” implies a natural, cohesive progression of the Psalter into diverse communities. However, this process was deeply political, disruptive, and frequently met with suspicion and hostility from the Church hierarchy. The most direct example of this hostility is the Constitutions of Oxford (1408), a set of rules issued by Archbishop Thomas Arundel. This decree was directly aimed at suppressing the Lollards — the followers of English reformer and Catholic priest John Wycliffe — by explicitly restricting access to unauthorized English translations of the Bible, including the Psalms. The Constitutions mandated that no one should translate or read any scripture into English without episcopal approval, effectively criminalizing lay ownership of the Wycliffite Psalter and formally linking vernacular scripture to heresy. This act demonstrates that the Church often viewed the Psalter in the common tongue not as a devotional aid, but as a source of subversive, unapproved theological interpretation.Simon ben Rabbi Samuel, \"Carcassone Bible\" (1422) (photo by Graham S. Haber)The decision to align diverse languages and cultures side-by-side in the exhibition, without acknowledging the periods of intense ethno-religious conflict, also suggests a misleading uniformity. During the Middle Ages, the Christian interpretation of the Psalms was frequently marshaled as a theological weapon against Judaism. Medieval Christian polemicists commonly interpreted the Imprecatory Psalms (those containing prayers for divine vengeance, such as Psalm 69 or Psalm 109) as prophesying the suffering and damnation of the Jewish people for their refusal to accept Christ. For example, Psalm 109:6–13 was often allegorically interpreted as a curse against Judas Iscariot and, by extension, the entire Jewish community. This theological framework was used to justify policies of persecution and segregation, a crucial, messy reality of the Psalter’s use in medieval Europe that is omitted when stressing only \"universal themes.”The exhibition's title, Sing a New Song, and the section “Performing the Psalms” emphasize the auditory \"performance\" of the text — how the Psalms were chanted, sung, and integrated into the daily offices. Yet the exhibition’s primary medium is the manuscript, an object that is inherently silent and visually focused. The display overemphasizes the physical relic (the luxurious book) while failing to fully reconstruct the ritualistic context that defined the Psalter’s primary function in medieval life. By not bridging the divide between the visual relics and the performed ritual — for instance, through accompanying audio loops of Gregorian chant or monastic recitation — the presentation ultimately prioritizes the expensive, silent object over the lived, functional, and auditory experience of the medieval (and illiterate) believer.This exhibition at the Morgan Library succeeds admirably as a showcase of glorious manuscript illumination and aristocratic devotion. However, in its effort to present a seamless, universally embraced history, it glosses over the critical realities that defined access to and interpretation of the Psalms: the breathtaking cost that restricted them to the elite, the political and ecclesiastical suppression of vernacular versions, and their use in justifying the marginalization of Jewish communities. The exhibition’s primary emphasis remains on the luxurious visual object rather than the complex, often conflict-ridden reality of the Psalter’s power within medieval life.Attavante degli Attavanti, \"Pope Leo X Vesting; Leo X Praying\" (1520), part of Praeparatio ad missam of Leo X Italy, Rome (photo by Janny Chiu)Giulio Clovio, \"Death of Uriah\" and \"David in Penance\" (1546) (photo by Janny Chiu)Master of Catherine of Cleves, \"The Virgin and the Crucified Christ Intercede for Catherine of Cleves; The Virgin and Christ in a Grape Arbor\" (c. 1440) (photo courtesy Faksimile Verlag Luzern)Unknown maker(s), \"Old Testament Scenes (Noah)\" (c. 1212–20) (photo by Janny Chiu)Sing a New Song: The Psalms in Medieval Art and Life continues at the Morgan Library and Museum (225 Madison Avenue, Murray Hill, Manhattan) through January 4.

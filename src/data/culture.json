    "body": "\n\n\t\nMysterious light sources, geometric puzzles, disjointed figures, and bold hues characterize the diverse, narrative compositions of Bryce Wymer. The Brooklyn-based artist is known for his enigmatic, emotive murals, paintings, and illustrations. Merging the analog and the digital, Wymer’s pieces often explore themes of social interactions and power dynamics, often through a lens tinged with anxiety, mystery, and solitude.\nWhether working on large-scale commissions or more intimate drawings, sketchbooks remain Wymer’s primary jumping-off points. “I’ve been keeping sketchbooks since middle school, when I filled them with graffiti tags, local DIY show flyer ideas, and zine layouts,” Wymer tells Colossal. “Over the years, they’ve evolved from casual notebooks into an essential part of my creative process. I carry one with me at all times, and without it, I feel pretty untethered.”\n\n\n\nThe artist often makes his way through three to four books each year, sometimes experimenting with compositions on grander canvases but often leaving them within their small format. “Some lose their raw energy when translated to a larger scale, which is a tension I enjoy trying to navigate,” he says. “That in-between space, where an idea first lands and where it eventually ends up, is part of what keeps the process so compelling.”\nWymer has recently been focused on figurative motifs that examine what he describes as “quiet tension and emotional complexity.” He positions the figures within minimal environments, highlighting social dynamics with undercurrents of vulnerability and perceptions of control—or lack thereof.\nFlat planes of saturated color nod to Social Realism, a movement that emerged between the World Wars and shone a light on everyday people as heroes in the face of especially government-generated adversity. For Wymer, Social Realism is indelibly linked to emotional and collective experience, which he channels through a varied and ever-evolving contemporary aesthetic. “More than anything, the sketchbook is my playground, free from expectations or fear of failure,” he says. “In any artistic practice, it’s important to have a space where very few rules exist.” \nSee more on Wymer’s website and Instagram, and watch even more timelapses on his Vimeo channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Palais de Tokyo in Paris (photo by Francisco Anzola via Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA work by American artist Cameron Rowland was taken down from the facade of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris after the museum said the piece, which involves replacing the French flag with the flag of Martinique, “could be considered illegal” under French law, Hyperallergic confirmed.\nThe contemporary art museum determined that “Replacement” (2025), which comments on the colonization of Martinique, an “overseas region” of France in the Caribbean, could violate laws governing the public display of flags. Rowland’s work was part of the exhibition ECHO DELAY REVERB: American Art, Francophone Thought, which opened at the Palais de Tokyo on Wednesday, October 22.\nA spokesperson for Palais de Tokyo told Hyperallergic that the museum had planned to include the work in the exhibition since the spring, but on September 18, they received a memorandum from the office of the French Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior related to the public display of flags.\nThe memo reiterated the “principle of neutrality” of the Conseil d’État, France’s highest administrative court, which prohibits the display on public buildings of symbols representing the advocacy of political, religious, or philosophical opinions.”\nThe notification came as the French government cracked down on the displays of Palestinian flags that had been flown at town halls in response to President Emmanuel Macron’s recognition of Palestinian statehood.\nAfter consulting with Rowland and their gallery, Palais de Tokyo allowed the flag to hang during the exhibition’s opening day only, and moved its accompanying text inside the museum afterward with a note that the flag had been excluded due to potential violations of French law.\n“Following this note and in consideration of the principle of public service neutrality, the Palais de Tokyo sought several legal opinions regarding the presentation of the artwork,” the spokesperson said. “These opinions indicated that the artist’s original display would contravene the principle of neutrality in public service.”\n\nA post from Maxwell Graham Gallery included photos of the updated museum labels. (screenshot Hyperallergic via Instagram)\nRowland’s New York-based gallery, Maxwell Graham, first announced the decision to exclude the piece on Instagram, posting images of updated labels inside the museum. The gallery has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s inquiries.\nMartinique, located southeast of Puerto Rico, has been a territory of France since it was colonized in 1635. It was the birthplace of Frantz Fanon, the widely influential psychiatrist and anti-colonial theorist. In 2024, France sent an anti-riot police force accused of excessive force to the island to quell protests against racial and social inequalities. \nRowland’s text recognizes the original colonization of the island and ongoing political movements. A plaque accompanying “Replacement” alludes to ongoing liberation struggles in Martinique. \n“Black Martinicans have pursued the end of French rule for 390 years,” the text reads. “As early as 1665, black rebels in Martinique wore red, black, and green as a ‘rallying sign.'”\nRowland received the MacArthur “Genius” award in 2019, a no-strings-attached $800,000 grant given to artists based on creative merit.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGilbert & George, \"Fates\" (2005) (© Gilbert & George, courtesy White Cube)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nLONDON — Who are — or, better, what is — Gilbert & George? British-born George Passmore (the taller one) and Gilbert Prousch, the shorter Italian one from San Martin de Tor in the South Tyrol province, met at St Martins School of Art in 1967. In 1969 they donned suits tailored in an already vintage style (the tweed three-piece that became their uniform), slathered themselves in multicolored metallic paint and sang “Underneath the Arches.” This was the first iteration of themselves as artwork. Since then, the oddball duo in archaic English dress have lived and worked together in East London as perhaps one of the original, most complete, and longest running examples of performance art. They speak as one, are married, and appear together nearly all the time, but always as their own art. \nThe problem with being the artwork, one would think, is that it is financially and practically unsustainable as a career (at least without a decades-long demand for singing sculptures). Thus out of necessity they turned to visual output: large-scale photomontages composed of smaller panels, like stained glass windows, always featuring the two men. Judging from the lending institutions named in the Hayward Gallery’s 25-year survey, Gilbert & George: 21st Century Pictures, these works have proven to be collectible. The list includes, variously, the Burger Collection, Hong Kong, Tate; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; and several private collections (curiously, several in Vienna), among many others. \nGilbert & George, “Bagrave” (2020)\nRachel Thomas, the Roden Chief Curator, along with assistant curators Suzanna Petot and Hannah Martin, seem to have placed the works according to the available wall shape, for the Hayward’s unusually sized and spaced walls are crammed. There are no captions listing name, date, and ownership, and the installation follows no chronological order. Each piece has a year, title, and the artists’ trademark signature embedded within it. A wall text explains how Gilbert & George explore “the fundamental truths at the heart of our existence: death, hope, life, fear, sex, money, race, religion.” So everything then. The curators intersperse text explaining how the artists “adapt sacred imagery to challenge religious belief systems” or “have always acknowledged mortality.” Their commentary is moot, for the images function less as means to explore these themes than to perpetuate the concept of Gilbert & George as the artwork, or even a brand. It is quite impressive how consistently they refer back to themselves as the OG.\nThey appear in every single piece, whether looming large with Mao-like enormous heads in three-quarter profile or making mock-shocked faces to the camera or facing frontally with arms outstretched in quasi-religious blessing, eyes cut out and alarmingly emphasized like so many ancient votive figurines. There is more than a whiff of idolatry in how they constantly appear as gods in their own icons. This is not to say that the images are propagandistic: they are filled with cheek, humor, provocation, and irreverence that is at times disarmingly charming. The standardized black-lined window format evokes the panels of a cartoon, with contrasting oversaturated colors to match: here, Gilbert & George are sleeping on a park bench; here, they’re adventuring through the drug-addled streets of Britain. Large scale, vivid, with just enough reference to big themes such as sex, death, and religion, they tick all the boxes a contemporary collector would want. It feels as if they have made collectible editions of themselves. \n\nGilbert & George, “Murder” (2011)\nJust enough reference, because — befitting their blaring slogans that shout “No Nazis,” “Homo Riot,” “God loves fucking! Enjoy” (all capitalized, naturally), printed in the infamous British tabloid-style font and accompanied by examples of posters used on A-boards — the works provide no more depth or analysis than the newspapers they mimic. They do not offer a stance or interpretation, or even a jumping off point, as much art attempts to do. Like the singing sculpture, the images just exist. What do Gilbert & George actually think of all these incredibly pertinent and alarming issues plaguing society? To ask that question is to miss the point, darling. \nThe cult of Gilbert & George continues in the gift shop, where merchandise has gone to town on all the key elements that form their brand: cheeky irreverence in a wooden swear box (“Pay up and f**k off”), duo bookmarks (what do you mean, they don’t both read the same book at the same time?), police-style tape emblazoned with “Homo riot,” and pins that say “free dick.” A little like Jeff Koons, who speaks of the meaning in his works like a true Pop Art salesman, with a Cheshire grin, you have to admire Gilbert & George’s total dedication to being the art: a peculiarly dry and British double act.\n\nInstallation view of Gilbert & George: 21st Century Pictures at the Hayward Gallery, London.

    "body": "\nPARIS — “Too big to fail” is a term mostly used in finance, but the phrase came to mind more than once as I navigated the massive fourth edition of Art Basel Paris, featuring presentations from over 200 galleries through this Sunday, October 26. At a time when the art world is going through a “the market is dead, long live the market!” moment, the fair suggests strong demand for art at different entry points.\nThis doesn’t mean, of course, that the anxiety isn’t real. The frequently cited 2024 Art Basel and UBS Survey of Global Collecting reported sales slipping at the higher end of the market, raising worries about a vacuum not being filled by younger buyers. But there’s also been positive news as new collectors seem to be entering the market, though at lower and mid-ranges. The just released 2025 Art Basel and UBS Survey noted the market’s relative resilience after last year’s correction.\nSomewhat omnisciently, Alex Da Corte installed a giant, partly deflated balloon-statue, “Kermit the Frog, Even” (2018/2025), outside the Place Vendôme during Paris Art Week. The work “reveals our collective anxieties,” according to a label. Located in a posh address near the Grand Palais, surrounded by high-end shops and hotels from Chanel to the Ritz, this cheeky green muppet is losing air from within amid all the affably aged glitz.\nAlex Da Corte’s massive inflatable Kermit the Frog sculpture outside the Place Vendôme\nBut at the Grand Palais itself, there were fewer signs that the art world can take itself a little less seriously. The fair layout is unsurprisingly hierarchical, with blue-chip and established galleries occupying the ground floor, the Premise program featuring special projects in the back, and the Emergence section, introducing new artists and younger galleries, spread across second-floor.\nAs usual, the bigger galleries reported some staggering sales. Hauser & Wirth said it sold Gerhard Richter’s “Abstract Painting” (1987) for $23 million. White Cube gallery claimed it placed Julie Mehretu’s “Charioteer” (2007) for $11.5 million, while Pace said someone bought Amedeo Modigliani’s “Young Woman with Hair in Side Burns” (1918) for nearly $10 million. Other established galleries also reported strong sales: Lisson said it sold a Leiko Ikemura bronze for $800,000 and placed two of her paintings, and PPOW said the gallery sold out Kyle Dunn’s paintings, with overall sales totaling $700,000.\nA view of Art Basel Paris inside the Grand Palais on October 23, 2025\nThe fair’s outgoing director Clément Delépine, who will be succeeded by Karim Crippa, the current head of communications and senior art editor at Art Basel globally, after 17 years at the helm, opted for more exclusivity for the VIP Avant Première opening on November 20. Each exhibitor was allowed just six invitations.  The strategy paid off for the biggest dealers, but some galleries told me that it made for a slow opening day, with sales picking up only on day two.\nGiven that most young buyers enter the market at around $5,000, according to the latest Art Basel/UBS survey, it’s worth asking where one might find this work at the Grand Palais — and what the fair is like for the artists whose work is priced at this level. Not surprisingly, they were concentrated in the Emergence section. Hong Kong-based Bank Gallery showed yellow-themed fabric furniture and biology- wall designs and drawings by artist and designer Duyi Han (the drawings, ranging from $2,700 to $17,000, all sold, the gallery said). Exo Exo in Paris, which transitioned from an artist-run project space into a commercial one four years ago, showed balloons and small paintings by Ash Love, with images lifted from small digital screens (still unsold when we spoke). Also in this section, Cibrian, a gallery from San Sebastián, Spain, showed the only large-scale video art I saw at the fair, by Siyi Liu (also unsold).\n\nAsh Love with works at the booth of Exo Exo at Art Basel Paris\nThe predominance of painting, with a scattering of photography and sculpture, went unchecked throughout. Josèfa Ntjam, showing with London-based gallery Nicoletti Contemporary, often refers back to her Cameroonian ancestry, combining ancestral imagery and Afrofuturism. This is her second time at the fair, after taking part in Emergence last year; she is also in the São Paulo Biennial. “I work mostly in video and installation and have a really mixed-media practice. I feel my career really grew in London. In terms of institutional practices, there’s more responsiveness in the art scene in the UK than in France,” Ntjam said.\nThe gallery shared a booth with London-based Seventeen in a continuing trend of exhibitors economizing on fair fees while challenging themselves to offer cohesive presentations. Nicoletti said it sold one of the three sound sculptures by Abbas Zahedi,  “Serpent Hole on Serpentine Wall” (2025), featuring a metal snake head that can be activated to emit sound and a base that’s a piece of cut-out wall from Serpentine Gallery, among the few pieces I saw that played with the idea of disrupting or hacking (into) the art world.\nA Gentil Carioca’s booth at Art Basel Paris \nI found some of the most compelling booths in the Premise section, where carefully curated proposals provided a refreshing sense of visual cohesion next to the fair’s overstimulating medley. There were strong presentations by women artists across the fair — notably at A Gentil Carioca and Fortes D’Aiola Gabriel, both from Brazil, with works from established artists such as Leda Catunda, whose acrylic on velvet piece, “Gotas Coloridas” (1998), sold for $175,000, and newcomers like Camiz Agrade, whose acrylic painting, “Sollilquy” (2025), sold for $28,000.\nTina Kim Gallery’s booth with works by Lee Shinja\nTina Kim Gallery presented geometric textile works by Lee Shinja, a 95-year-old Korean artist who has a major retrospective at the Berkley Art Museum. Galerie Eric Mouchet, with spaces in Paris and Brussels, showed stunning Constructivist works by Ella Bergman-Michel, one of which, the gallery said, was acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Meanwhile, Düsseldorf-based Kadel Willborn presented minimalist photographs by Bauhaus artist Lucia Moholy, poignantly paired with a quietly poetic piece by Liz Deschenes made in response to Moholy’s work.\nNot all dealers can claim the successes reaped at the fair by the biggest galleries, and for new artists, visibility may not be matched by sales. As usual, blue-chip sales reports paint only a small part of the picture, but Art Basel Paris may have shown its ability to introduce under-discovered artists to new buyers.\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrea Gyorody at the Weisman Museum, with work by Elana Mann in background (photo by Ron Hall, courtesy Andrea Gyorody)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe director of an embattled university museum has resigned after artists accused the school administration of censoring an exhibition she curated. Andrea Gyorody stepped down as director of the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University, confirming to Hyperallergic that today would be her last day in the role.\nHer resignation comes three weeks after the university administration decided to alter two works it considered “political” that were on view in the group show Hold My Hand in Yours, curated by Gyorody. The school then shuttered the exhibition six months early after several artists requested that their work be withdrawn from the show in protest.\nMichael Friel, Pepperdine’s senior director of Communications and Public Relations, told Hyperallergic that Gyorody and the school had “mutually agreed” that she would step down. \n“The University thanks Dr. Gyorody for her leadership and contributions during her tenure,” the museum said.\nThe university had turned off Elana Mann’s video “Call to Arms 2015-2025” (2025), which documents 10 years of performances and protests featuring the artist’s arm-shaped megaphones. Administrators also turned over a small embroidered patch reading “Abolish ICE,” part of the large-scale collaborative sculpture “Con Nuestros Manos Construimos Deidades (With Our Hands We Build Deities)” (2023) by the group Art Made Between Opposite Sides (AMBOS).\n“Because Pepperdine’s established practice with the Weisman Museum has been to avoid overtly political content consistent with the University’s nonprofit status, it removed these two pieces from display,” a university spokesperson told Hyperallergic at the time.\nAfter the museum was shuttered, students, faculty, and alumni voiced their outrage. On Friday, October 17, faculty of the Fine Arts Division at Pepperdine’s Seaver College posted a statement affirming their “full and unwavering support for our students and their right to engage in creative inquiry without fear of censorship.”\n“As educators and scholars, we believe that the freedom to explore complex and challenging ideas is central to the mission of a Christian liberal arts education such as Pepperdine University,” the statement continued. “Suppressing artwork because it is perceived as ‘political’ undermines this mission and erodes trust in the academic process.”\n\nThe “Freedom Wall” at Pepperdine University, where community members posted anti-censorship messages (photo by and courtesy Grace Bidewell)\nOn the evening of October 9, about 100 students gathered for an art night, making posters and signs which were then posted to a “Freedom Wall” at the school’s student center. \nThe protest art will be used again next Wednesday, October 29, in a demonstration outside the Elkins auditorium, where faculty will be meeting to discuss recent events at the museum, according to Pepperdine senior Grace Bidewell. Mann said she plans to attend with her horns to amplify the students’ message. \nBidewell, an art and sustainability double major, told Hyperallergic that the alteration of the artwork was at odds with Pepperdine’s Christian mission. \n“It doesn’t align with their beliefs as a school. Christ had the view that all beings were created equal. Having artwork that respects that view shouldn’t be a problem,” Bidwell said.\nBryan C. Keene, a third-generation Pepperdine alum who also taught art history there and had his first art world job as a museum attendant at the Weisman, echoed those sentiments in an open letter to Pepperdine’s president and board on October 12. \n“The recent censorship of artworks at the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art represents a profound betrayal of Pepperdine’s academic mission, its Christian values, and its stated commitment to diversity and global leadership,” Keene wrote. \nHe also rejected the school’s argument that its nonprofit status prohibited the display of artwork with political content. “Displaying an artist’s work does not constitute institutional endorsement; suggesting otherwise reflects a profound misunderstanding of both art and education,” Keene said.\nGyorody became director of the Weisman in 2021, where she organized exhibitions on artists Hildur Ásgeirsdóttir Jónsson, Jeni Spota C., Isabel Yellin, and Karl Haendel. She was previously assistant curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, where she co-curated Afterlives of the Black Atlantic, which received a 2020 Award for Curatorial Excellence from the Association of Art Museum Curators. \n“It’s a huge loss for the Pepperdine community and the larger LA art community. She’s a brilliant curator, art historian, writer, and thinker,” Mann told Hyperallergic. “There’s a sadness amongst students and faculty, but I hope it will spark meaningful change as to who ultimately decides what will go into the museum.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMatt Stromberg is a freelance visual arts writer based in Los Angeles.

    "body": "\nLVIV — The city of Lviv has been a hub for Ukrainians fleeing Russian assaults and brutality since 2014, serving as a home to humanitarian projects like Superhumans and Unbroken that provide rehabilitation, support, extensive therapy, and prosthetics for war victims. Though it has not suffered nearly the volume and intensity of Russian attacks as have regions further east, it is far from immune to the current war. The storied, cathedral-rich city dating to the 13th century is subject to aerial attacks, including a recent one that killed one civilian and injured many more on August 21, shortly after I departed. \nI was there to visit The Stammering Circle, a signature component of Faktura 10, a year-long series of exhibitions, art projects, concerts, performances, films, and symposia mostly in Ukraine (two events were in New York). Faktura 10 Chief Curator and Director Marta Kuzma, an American from a Ukrainian immigrant family, was a crucial figure in the post-independence 1990s Ukrainian art scene. Now she’s come home, so to speak. The title of the exhibition, which is on view at Jam Factory Art Center and two other venues, references the Romanian-Jewish poet, writer, translator, and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan (born in what is now Chernivtsi in Ukraine) — specifically his efforts to fashion a language and art in his mother tongue, German, with the ability to survive and flourish amid trauma and war. \n\nJulie Poly, Ukrzaliznytsia (2025), framed color photograph mounted on aluminum and color photographs\nSurprisingly, few artworks in the exhibition directly address the current war, and many were made years ago, sometimes far from Ukraine. However, all do so obliquely, while situating artmaking in a context of war, resistance, resilience, and fundamental humanity. \nIn his 2011–12 series Structures of Madness, Ukrainian photographer Boris Mikhailov captures rugged rock formations, caves, and mountainous surfaces. Geological markings hint at human, energetic, often erotic, sometimes fantastical figures, which the artist’s adjacent drawings clarify — conflations of nature and humans. Mikhailov is from Kharkiv, now attacked daily and nightly by Russia. For me, his series assumes startling new connotations during wartime, including the fierce attachment of a people to their land.\nThe silhouette and drawn figures in Mikhailov’s work connect with those in American artist R.H. Quaytman’s nearby innovative paintings from her 2021 series Modern Subjects, Chapter Zero, based in part on artworks concerning pressing social issues by 19th-century Belgian painter Antoine Wiertz. An upended, headless body; a solitary, small orphan; a suicide with a pistol — these resonate in contemporary Ukraine.\n\nYana Kononova, Incendiary Lands (2025), black-and-white print from negative (photo Gregory Volk/Hyperallergic)\nYana Kononova’s large-scale, black and white photographs, at once voluptuous and foreboding, are of mud volcanoes and rocky terrain in oil-producing Azerbaijan, formerly part of the Soviet Union. They are coupled with “Incendiary Lands” (2025), comprising reprints of archival photos in a vitrine showing derricks and infrastructure from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Russians were central to the development of the petroleum industry in Azerbaijan. Now, oil and gas fuel the Russian economy and war machine: Oil profits equal death for Ukrainians. Many countries are looking to independent Azerbaijan as a replacement for Russian petroleum. Kononova was born on the Azerbaijani island of Pirallahi and emigrated with her family to Ukraine during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988 to ’94 (part of the nation’s ongoing attacks on Armenian communities and cultural heritage). She is now living through another war. Juxtaposing geological and human time, her primeval landscapes link fossil fuels with global warming and war. \nConceptual, visual, and material correspondences course through this sensitively curated exhibition. A single, prominent sunflower in Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki’s street scene “Tokyo Fine Day” (1993/2025), one of several photographs from early in his career in the exhibition, is especially apt here: The sunflower is a symbol of Ukraine. Lebanese artist Walid Raad’s vibrant inkjet prints are geometric abstractions that also resemble flowers, including sunflowers in some cases, as in the series Appendix 153, part of The Atlas Group (1989–2004) which archived imagined stories and artifacts of the Lebanese Civil War. \n\nWalid Raad in collaboration with The Atlas Group, 1989–2004, Appendix 153 (2019), framed pigmented inkjet print\nRaad’s accompanying fictional story indicates that these prints are photographs that the apocryphal Palestinian artist Suha Traboulsi took in the late 1950s of her own work. He writes that while “many Arab art historians” perceived her paintings as forerunners of Op-Art, they were instead based on shell explosions during the ’70s in war-stricken Beirut. A small photograph of an explosion is attached to each print. Raad’s story, sly and fanciful yet vaguely plausible, is indelible. He has found a novel way of transmuting war into beauty, terror into art, without sanitizing its brutality. \nElsewhere, Ukrainian artist Julie Poly’s 2025 photographs explore the life of Ukrzaliznytsia, the highly efficient and hospitable national rail system that gives the series its name. She capture scenes of everyday life: a female soldier in fatigues curled up and asleep in a sleeper car next to her black dog, a smiling woman with several fluffy dogs and numerous trophies; a shirtless, tattooed soldier with his head bowed as if deep in thought or prayer; children with their toys, a train car transformed into a makeshift hospital, diligent conductors at work. There is such humanity in these images — joy, love, sorrow, endurance, tenderness — that contrasts so extremely with Russia’s inhumane war. A young woman lying on her back calmly gazes at the camera. She embodies the whole nation’s exhaustion and resolve. \n\nJulie Poly, Ukrzaliznytsia (2025), framed color photograph mounted on aluminum and color photographs\nWhile Vladimir Putin seeks to deny and eliminate Ukrainian identity altogether, a collaborative installation by set designer Janina Pedan and artist Anna-Mariia Kucherenko at the Dim 42 art space features uniquely Ukrainian symbols, signs, and ornaments dating back centuries. At the Jam Factory, a film by Moyra Davey focuses on four diasporic artists: Paul Celan; Peter Hujar, who was raised by his Ukrainian grandparents; Kyiv-born filmmaker Maya Deren, whose family fled to escape anti-Jewish pogroms in the 1920s; and Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, whose family also fled Western Ukraine during the pogroms.\nUkrainian filmmaker Oleksiy Radynski, collaborating with researcher Philipp Goll, has turned recently unearthed film footage taken by a group of Ukrainian filmmakers in Siberia in the 1980s into an extraordinary single-channel video, a travelogue of sorts titled “Where Russia Ends” (2024). Narrated by filmmaker Lyuba Knorozok, it exposes the brutality, greed, and racism underpinning the subjugation and exploitation of Indigenous peoples (notably Buryats) under the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union, accompanied by enormous environmental damage. Left implicit is that Putin’s so-called “special military operation,” which also impacts Indigenous communities at home, is more of the same; yet another Russian colonial war with devastating consequences, including ecocide.\nDavey’s entrancing video “Four [чотири]” (2025), commissioned specifically for this exhibition, combines scenes of diverse people playing, dancing, communing, and exercising in Manhattan’s Riverside Park with the recitation of an excellent text about the artists, read by Davey in English and Knorozok in Ukrainian. The New York scenes include symbols of Ukrainian culture — hair, dancing, flowers, and music among them. Near this deeply touching video hang two absurdist yet ominous 1815–17 etchings by Francisco Goya with cavorting figures, women in one, men in the other. The Spanish artist was himself steeped in war and brings historical gravity to this superlative show, whose pangs and dreams still resonate with his own two centuries later.\n\nFrancisco Goya, “Disparate femenino” (1815–17) (left) and “Modo de Volar” (1815–16) (right), etching, aquatint, and drypoint on laid paper\nInstallation view of The Stammering Circle at the Jam Factory Art Center, with Nobuyoshi Araki’s “Tokyo Fine Day” (1993/2025) in the background and Boris Mikhailov’s Series of Four (1982–83/2025), print of contact sheet, in the foreground\nThe Stammering Circle continues at multiple venues across Lviv, Ukraine, through November 2. The exhibition was curated by Marta Kuzma.\n\t",

Le Guin at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, London (all images © Elena Andreea Teleaga, unless otherwise noted)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nLONDON — How does any great creative work by a novelist or poet come into being? This question never fails to fascinate. Henry James preceded his great 1916 novel The Ambassadors by writing the most intricate of plot lines, a work almost as dense as the finished novel itself. It was quite different for the poet W.B. Yeats: The first draft of the first poem of a great sequence called The Tower was so far from its final outcome that you could never have guessed at it. And yet he got there in the end.\nAnd what of Ursula K. Le Guin, the American novelist, whose many works occupied a fascinating terrain somewhere between fantasy and science fiction? How did she begin to realize her multiple fictional creations? A new exhibition at the handsomely sited Architectural Association in London — in a Georgian building that looks out onto London’s sole surviving entire 18th-century square — shows us. The Word for World is a rhythmical presentation of slender, wafty banners suspended from the ceiling, all blue cyanotypes on which are maps reproduced in white. Navigating the space is a matter of ducking and weaving.\n\nInstallation view of The Word for World: The Maps of Ursula K. Le Guin at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, London, featuring an untitled and undated sketch of Stonehenge by Le Guin.\nYes, Le Guin was a map maker. That’s how she found her way into her invented worlds. After she made her maps, she proceeded to settle on them and mentally walk around inside them. If we home in on the exhibition’s maps themselves we can begin to unlock her secrets. Take, for example, “Earthsea,” an aerial view of a great archipelago of islands, several of the larger ones in a great central cluster, others frittering out in all directions of the compass. A close look at all the hand-drawn map’s detail reveals a great deal of naming of particular locations: Havnor, Osskill Sea, the Inmost Sea, mountains, a small group of islands collectively known as The Torikles. It was her way into the imaginative world that would eventually end in a celebrated  trilogy of novels. How did it help her? How did it show her the way ahead as a conjurer of a world that had never before existed?\nThe map was reproduced in the first edition of A Wizard of Earthsea (1968). Years later she explained in an introduction to the collected Books of Earthsea:\n\nThe first thing I did was sit down and draw a map. I saw and named Earthsea and all its islands. I knew almost nothing about  them, but I knew their names. In the name is the magic.\n\nThe naming was the key — it lit the touch paper. It enabled her to “set sail with [the wizard] Ged from Gont … to Rake, and the Ninety Isles, and Osskil, and farther east even than Astowell ….”\n\nInstallation view of hand-drawn maps, watercolors, and ink drawings in The Word for World: The Maps of Ursula K.

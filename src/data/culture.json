    "body": "\n\n\t\nYou’ve probably heard the idiom, “the elephant in the room,” to describe when there’s some uncomfortable and obvious problem that no one is addressing—the kind of issue that feels as though it’s taking up all available space. But what if yet another megafauna came stampeding onto the scene? That’s where Berlin-based artist Itamar Gov’s large-scale installation comes in.\nThe Rhinoceros in the Room is a towering, inflatable sculpture that fills a medieval church nave at Kunstmuseum Magdeburg in Germany. Gov draws inspiration from Renaissance engraver Albrecht Dürer’s iconic rhinoceros woodcut, which the artist created in 1515 without having ever seen one of the animals himself. His rendering is wildly inaccurate in terms of anatomy, depicting an extra horn at the creature’s shoulders and armor instead of a thick leather hide, but thanks to the ability to replicate it in print, it captured the public’s imagination.\n\nDürer’s image persists as a symbol of imperial might and prestige. The animal itself represents power and vigor, and one was even gifted from Sultan Muzafar II of Gujaratm, India, to King Manuel I of Portugal in 1515, providing the inspiration for the artist’s rendering.\nThe rhinoceros has also been hunted and poached nearly to extinction, and several species remain critically endangered today. For The Rhinoceros in the Room, Gov “combines historical events, philosophical ideas, and local legends and questions the fragile boundaries between fact and fiction; memory and imagination,” the museum says.\nPortrayed in monochrome gray, the gentle giant lumbers amid the 11th-century Romanesque colonnades, assuming a spectral guise. On one hand, it’s somewhat absurd in its sheer size and sense of being out-of-place, yet on the other, the creature invokes curiosity and wonder and stands sentry as an icon of brawn and resilience.\nThe Rhinoceros in the Room remains on view through July 5.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhile balancing atop a precarious stack of bolsters and tables, a young juggler sends four bright balls up into the air. A fellow performer stands on the floor nearby, observing the skillful toss against the backdrop of a wall-mounted tent in bright, primary colors.\nVeiled in a warm glow, the photo by Constanze Han offers a rare glimpse into a practice session at Escuela Nacional de Circo, Havana’s center for circus performance. “Founded after the Cuban Revolution, the school was part of a broader effort to make professional arts education accessible to young people across the island,” Han shares. “With Soviet support in the late 1970s, it blended technical rigor with Cuban creativity and style, shaping a distinct circus tradition that continues today.”\n\nCircuses have an enduring role in Cuban culture, one that began in the 16th century “as a family-run, traveling tradition, especially in the countryside,” the photographer adds. Combined with Soviet styles following the revolution, the circus became a distinctive blend of “rumba, Cuban folklore, and Afro-Cuban influences.”\nHan has worked on several projects in Cuba in the past few years, often in collaboration with her friend Karla Batte. While staying in Havana for a residency at Casa Cache, a connection from an earlier project that centered around the iconic Tropicana Nightclub introduced Han to the school.\nDuring a week-long visit, she created Circus of a Revolution, which documents a group of ambitious, dedicated artists and offers a timely glimpse of youth culture in a country that has been experiencing a mass exodus of its youngest generations. Cuba lost nearly 20 percent of its population between 2022 and 2023 alone, and one in four residents is currently over age 60.\nHan notes that amid the country’s dire economic situation, Circus of a Revolution provides an alternate look at the people defining its cultural output. Whether a posed portrait or candid snapshot, the photos echo the intimacy and focus of the performers, while capturing the beauty of creative expression and how it flourishes amid enormous difficulties. \n\n“Because a lot of the equipment is older and manually operated, performers rely heavily on discipline, teamwork, and each other. This creates a strong sense of community, camaraderie, and mutual support within the practice,” she adds.\nHan’s work has taken her around the world, from Tegucigalpa to Taipei, where she’s photographed often unseen communities and ways of life.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor residents of the Upper Midwest and Canada—the land of lakes—ice shanties are ubiquitous winter fixtures. From the huge temporary villages that emerge on Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago for sturgeon-spearing season to ramshackle, hand-built huts dotting Ontario’s Lake Simcoe, these vernacular structures are designed around openings or hatches in the floors so that hardy northerners can fish through holes drilled in the ice. It’s this unique tradition, combined with artistic flair, that serves as the inspiration for Art Shanty Projects.\nEvery winter, the Minneapolis-based program initiates an interactive series of projects on the lima bean-shaped Lake Harriet, located a few miles southwest of downtown. Dozens of artists construct one-of-a-kind huts that the public is invited to explore and interact with over the course of four weekends.\n\nFor the 2026 season, Art Shanty Projects commissioned local artists Emily Quandahl and Madeline Cochran for a bright, inviting, collaborative shelter. Quandahl’s practice predominantly centers around painting, and Cochran takes a multimedia approach to two-dimensional work, often incorporating textiles and weaving techniques.\nFor their “Quilt Shanty,” the duo conceived of a vibrant, blanket-like patchwork design that transports the feeling of comfort out into the lake’s stark openness. “We wanted to take a literal approach to the ‘barn quilt‘ by stretching a tactile textile over an agricultural form—specifically a hoop house,” Quandahl tells Colossal.\nA hoop house is a structure often used in gardens and agricultural settings that comprises a tunnel covered in PVC sheeting, which protects plants and can extend the growing season by a few weeks. Both artists grew up in the Driftless Region of Wisconsin and Minnesota, indelibly influenced by the region’s rural lifeways revolving around farming and deep-seated community.\n\n“Quilt Shanty” blends Cochran’s interest in folk illustrations through muslin compositions and interactive wooden quilt-square puzzle pieces. Quandahl constructed the hoop house frame and the 9-by-16-foot quilt made of studio scraps, vinyl, and drop cloths that encompasses it. To go along with Cochran’s wooden pieces, Quandahl also designed a trifold screen that serves as a key to the puzzle.\n“During our month on the ice, we found that nearly everyone who stepped into the shanty had a story to tell, whether it was about a quilt they inherited, a family member who taught them to sew, or a specific pattern that reminded them of home,” Quandahl says. “This collaboration really harkened back to the idea of a quilting bee. Historically, these weren’t just about sewing; they were social anchors for a community through communal labor.”\nExplore more of both Quandahl and Cochran’s work on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

While pursuing his MFA at Parsons School of Design in the 1980s, Johnson studied under many of Hofmann’s former students, including Paul Resika, Jane Freilicher, Leland Bell, Robert De Niro, Sr., and Larry Rivers, which informed his personal work and painting style. Through this exhibition, Johnson seeks to bridge the connection between Hofmann’s teaching legacy and its impact on contemporary American painting.Mitchell Johnson, “Paris (Green Window)” (2018-2024), 19x27 inches (©Mitchell Johnson, 2026)Personal Color will be on view from February 28 through March 21, 2026, with an opening reception held on Saturday, February 28, from 3 to 5pm (CET). An artist talk with Mitchell Johnson will also take place on Saturday, March 14, from 2 to 3pm (CET).Johnson’s paintings are in 700 private collections and the permanent collections of 40 museums. His work has also been the subject of museum retrospectives at the Bakersfield Museum of Art and Musee Villa Les Camelias in Cap d’Ail, France.

(photo by ZUNIS, courtesy Gabrielle Goliath studio)\n    \n        \n            South Africa has withdrawn its participation from the 2026 Venice Biennale following a months-long dispute over an artwork addressing Palestinian grief in Gaza.The move comes after the country's right-wing culture minister Gayton McKenzie scrapped a pavilion proposal by artist Gabrielle Goliath and curator Ingrid Masondo. An independent committee had selected the artist and curator in December to represent the country at the international art event. The two had proposed including a performance centering Gaza. Goliath and Masondo had planned to memorialize the lives of Gazans killed by the Israeli military, including the poet Hiba Abu Nada, as part of the ongoing performance series Elegy. The duo also planned to reference femicide in South Africa and the German-perpetuated Herero and Nama genocide in Namibia during the early 20th century.But in January, McKenzie halted Goliath and Masondo’s participation, arguing that the national pavilion “should not be used to amplify similarly divisive global disputes that do not center South Africa’s own story.” Goliath and Masondo’s dismissal was immediately met with opposition and accusations of censorship. “It is nothing short of shameful for the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture to have announced that South Africa will not be presenting a national pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year,” Goliath and Mosado said in a statement shared with Hyperallergic. “The space will remain empty: a space of erasure, cancellation, censure.”McKenzie's office has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s requests for comment on the withdrawal.Shortly after McKenzie pulled Goliath and Mosado’s pavilion in January, the duo sued the cultural minister in a South African court for making “unlawful attempt” to “censor and silence” their work. Earlier this week, however, a judge dismissed their case in a two-sentence ruling, according to a statement shared with Hyperallergic by a spokesperson for the duo. The judge also ordered Goliath and Mosado to pay the government’s lawyers' fees.Goliath and Mosado told Hyperallergic that they intended to appeal the decision, arguing that the ruling “jeopardise[s] the rights of artists, curators and creatives in South Africa to freedom of expression.”McKenzie’s actions to dismantle the Gaza-inclusive pavilion appear to represent an uncommon position within the South African government. Three decades after the official end of Apartheid, the South African government brought Israel in front of the International Court of Justice in 2024 for perpetuating the crime of genocide in Gaza in an ongoing landmark human rights case.The final deadline for countries to submit their pavilion proposals was January 19, days before Goliath and Mosado filed their lawsuit.“Elegy sounds a call to mourn, to refuse conditions of disregard and to assert black, brown, indigenous, femme, queer, and trans lives as lovable and grievable,” Goliath and Mosado wrote in their statement. “That call will not be silenced.”\n        ",

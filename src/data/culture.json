    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tDecember 16th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe youngest movie­go­ers today do not, of course, remem­ber a time before visu­al effects could be cre­at­ed dig­i­tal­ly. What may give us more pause is that, at this point in cin­e­ma his­to­ry, most of their par­ents don’t remem­ber it either. Con­sid­er the fact that Steven Spiel­berg’s Juras­sic Park, with its once impos­si­bly real­is­tic (and still whol­ly pass­able) CGI dinosaurs, came out 32 years ago. That may put it, we must acknowl­edge, into the realm of the “clas­sic,” the kind of pic­ture whose enter­tain­ment val­ue holds up despite — or because of — the qual­i­ties that fix it in its time. Equal­ly spec­tac­u­lar but longer-can­on­ized clas­sics pose a greater chal­lenge to the imag­i­na­tions of young view­ers, who can hard­ly guess how they could have been made “before com­put­ers.”\nAfter see­ing the notable exam­ples pro­vid­ed in the new Pri­mal Space video above, they’ll cer­tain­ly under­stand one thing: it was­n’t easy. Even a seem­ing­ly sim­ple effect like the pen float­ing loose through the zero-grav­i­ty cab­in in 2001: A Space Odyssey required no small degree of inge­nu­ity. We might nat­u­ral­ly assume that film­mak­ers in 1968 would have accom­plished it with a cou­ple of pieces of Scotch tape and fish­ing line, but that would have result­ed in unac­cept­able tan­gling prob­lems, to say noth­ing of the trick­i­ness of ensur­ing, quite lit­er­al­ly, that the strings did­n’t show. Instead, Kubrick­’s team end­ed up attach­ing the pen to a sheet of glass — metic­u­lous­ly cleaned, no doubt, to elim­i­nate the pos­si­bil­i­ty of streaks — large enough to occu­py the entire frame and thus go unno­ticed by the view­er. It was then slow­ly rotat­ed by a crank-turn­ing assis­tant.\nA few dif­fer­ent effects from 2001 come in for expla­na­tion through­out the course of the video, includ­ing the mul­ti­ple-expo­sure pho­tog­ra­phy that made pos­si­ble shots of space­craft pass­ing plan­ets as well as the psy­che­del­ic “Star Gate” sequence toward the end. Though some of the devices used in these process­es were put togeth­er just for the pro­duc­tion, the under­ly­ing tech­niques had already been evolv­ing for more than 60 years. Indeed, many were pio­neered by Georges Méliès, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture for A Trip to the Moon from 1902, the very first sci­ence-fic­tion film. This video goes behind the scenes of a work from the year before: L’Homme à la tête en caoutchouc, or The Man with the Rub­ber Head, in which Méliès man­aged a shot in which his own cra­ni­um inflates to huge pro­por­tions with­out the use of so much as a zoom lens.\nOth­er exam­ples, drawn from a range of beloved films from Metrop­o­lis to Mary Pop­pins, illus­trate the inven­tive­ness born of sheer tech­ni­cal lim­i­ta­tion in the days when film­mak­ing was a whol­ly ana­log affair. In some cas­es, the effects these pro­duc­tions pulled off with minia­tures, prisms, and mir­rors 60, 80, 100 years ago look as good as any­thing Hol­ly­wood puts on the screen today — or rather bet­ter, since the innate phys­i­cal­i­ty behind them makes them feel more “real.” Per­haps unsur­pris­ing­ly, this video’s arti­fi­cial-intel­li­gence course spon­sor makes ref­er­ence to the end­less range of visu­al pos­si­bil­i­ties avail­able to those who mas­ter that tech­nol­o­gy. And it’s not impos­si­ble that we now stand on the cusp of a rev­o­lu­tion in visu­al effects for that rea­son, with at least as much of an upside and down­side as CGI. If so, we should pre­pare our­selves to hear the ques­tion, from chil­dren born today, of how any­one ever made movies before AI.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow Georges Méliès A Trip to the Moon Became the First Sci-Fi Film & Changed Cin­e­ma For­ev­er (1902)\nThe Art of Cre­at­ing Spe­cial Effects in Silent Movies: Inge­nu­ity Before the Age of CGI\nThe 1927 Film Metrop­o­lis Cre­at­ed a Dystopi­an Vision of What the World Would Look Like in 2026–and It Hits Close to Home\nHow Stan­ley Kubrick Made 2001: A Space Odyssey: A Sev­en-Part Video Essay\nHow 2001: A Space Odyssey Became “the Hard­est Film Kubrick Ever Made”\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Real Any­more: A Close Look at Chang­ing Film­mak­ing Tech­niques\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History, Politics |   \tDecember 17th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen the Nazis came to pow­er in 1933, they declared the begin­ning of a “Thou­sand-Year Reich” that ulti­mate­ly came up about 988 years short. Fas­cism in Italy man­aged to hold on to pow­er for a cou­ple of decades, which was pre­sum­ably still much less time than Ben­i­to Mus­soli­ni imag­ined he’d get on the throne. His­to­ry shows us that regimes of this kind suf­fered a fair­ly severe sta­bil­i­ty prob­lem, which is per­haps why they need­ed to put forth such a sol­id, for­mi­da­ble image. The IMPERIAL video above explores “the evil genius of fas­cist design,” focus­ing on how Hitler and Mus­soli­ni ren­dered their ide­olo­gies in art and the built envi­ron­ment, but many of its obser­va­tions can be gen­er­al­ized to any polit­i­cal move­ment that seeks total con­trol of a soci­ety, espe­cial­ly if that soci­ety has a suf­fi­cient­ly glo­ri­ous-seem­ing past.\nFas­cis­m’s visu­al lan­guage has many inspi­ra­tions, two of the most impor­tant cit­ed in the video being  Roman­ti­cism and Futur­ism. The for­mer offered “a long­ing for the past, an obses­sion with nature, and a focus on the sub­lime”; the lat­ter “wor­shiped speed, machines, and vio­lence.” Despite their appar­ent con­tra­dic­tion, these dual cur­rents allowed fas­cism “a pecu­liar abil­i­ty to look both back­ward and for­ward, to sum­mon the glo­ry of past empires while promis­ing a rad­i­cal new future.”\nIn Italy, such an empire may have been dis­tant in time, but it was nev­er­the­less close at hand. “We dream of a Roman Italy that is wise and strong, dis­ci­plined and Impe­r­i­al.” Even Hitler drew from the glo­ries of ancient Rome and Greece to shape his own aspi­ra­tional vision of an all-pow­er­ful Ger­man civ­i­liza­tion.\nHence both of those dic­ta­tors under­tak­ing large-scale Neo­clas­si­cal-style archi­tec­tur­al projects “to bring the aes­thet­ics of ancient Rome to their city streets,” includ­ing even mus­cu­lar stat­ues meant to embody the offi­cial­ly sanc­tioned human ide­al. Of course, the builders of the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca had also looked to Roman forms, but they did so at a small­er, more humane scale. Fas­cist struc­tures were designed not just to be eter­nal sym­bols but over­whelm­ing pres­ences, intend­ed “not to ele­vate the soul, but to crush the indi­vid­ual into the crowd and pro­mote con­for­mi­ty.” This, in the­o­ry, would make the cit­i­zen feel small and pow­er­less, but with an accom­pa­ny­ing qua­si-reli­gious long­ing to be part of a larg­er project: that of fas­cism, which sub­or­di­nates every­thing to the state. For the likes of Mus­soli­ni and Hitler (an artist-turned-politi­cian, as one can hard­ly fail to note), aes­thet­ics was pow­er — albeit not quite enough, in the event, to ensure their own sur­vival.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWal­ter Ben­jamin Explains How Fas­cism Uses Mass Media to Turn Pol­i­tics Into Spec­ta­cle (1935)\nYale Pro­fes­sor Jason Stan­ley Iden­ti­fies 10 Tac­tics of Fas­cism: The “Cult of the Leader,” Law & Order, Vic­tim­hood and More\nMus­soli­ni Sends to Amer­i­ca a Hap­py Mes­sage, Full of Friend­ly Feel­ings, in Eng­lish (1927)\nAre You a Fas­cist?: Take Theodor Adorno’s Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Test Cre­at­ed to Com­bat Fas­cism (1947)\nThe Sto­ry of Fas­cism: Rick Steves’ Doc­u­men­tary Helps Us Learn from the Painful Lessons of the 20th Cen­tu­ry\nUmber­to Eco’s List of the 14 Com­mon Fea­tures of Fas­cism\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

The husband-and-wife duo have been working with white paper since 2010, when they began experimenting with illumination and shadow. Today, they’re known for their intricately layered narratives that translate the magical allure of fairytales and mythology into dynamic sculptures.\n“Paper is brutal in its simplicity,” the artists say. “It is skin and skeleton. It demands attention and can be moulded, carved, sculpted, and cut. It can be shaped in various forms that hold memory, resilience, and silence.”\n“All That Glitters Is Gold”\nHari & Deepti, who are currently based in Mumbai, have a collection of works on view at Nucleus that draw on this sentiment. All That Glitters Is Gold features a variety of light boxes that depict tiny figures skating and gathering amid dense forest scenes. “It is about everything human and the connections we carry,” the artists say.\nIf you’re in Portland, Oregon, you can see All That Glitters Is Gold through January 11.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhile studying art history as a Princeton undergrad, Field Kallop was tasked with an assignment that continues to shape her artistic practice today. The prompt was to consider the relationship between the micro and macro, and she thought about the atom and galaxies, two organic structures with the same design despite their vastly different scales.\nThis experience vaulted the young art historian-turned-painter toward an enduring line of inquiry that reaches into astronomy, physics, mathematics, philosophy, religious iconography, and much more. “I’m not really a religious person, but I think I’m spiritual in that I’m interested in that beauty and that order that is everywhere, that connects everyone,” Kallop tells Colossal from her New York studio.\n“Silent Hours (Study)” (2024), watercolor on Arches paper, 23 x 23 inches\nInvoking the approaches of abstract pioneers like Hilma af Klint and Agnes Martin, Kallop cultivates a deeply contemplative practice in which she produces bold, chromatic works that read like mystical color charts. Smooth gradients radiate from one edge to the other through perfectly cordoned rays, circles, and lines. Each piece begins with a precisely measured grid and continues with the artist nesting washes of pigment into the uniform geometries.\nBodies of Light, Kallop’s most recent body of work, goes on view this week at GAVLAK. Featuring some of her largest pieces to date, the exhibition comprises a collection of watercolor studies and subsequent paintings, three of which are arranged as a monumental triptych stretching 18 feet. Awash in brilliant color, the gallery becomes a sort of sacred space as it envelops visitors in a bold palette that catches and reflects the light. Some works even contain bisected circles of gold and silver leaf, evoking the sun and moon and bolstering their radiant qualities.\nDuring the last few years, Kallop has slowly been scaling up her works, which each begin as a small rendering before turning into a larger, two-to-three-foot watercolor study. For the pieces that merit further exploration, the artist reiterates these in acrylic on canvas. But while the materials differ, her approach remains the same, and she even waters down her acrylics to achieve a more watercolor-like consistency. “I have a pretty good idea of what the painting will end up looking like based on the watercolor. And that’s when I really get into the flow,” she adds.\nKallop also works on each piece horizontally. For smaller pieces, this allows her to drape her body atop the composition. Larger works, on the other hand, like the six-foot Inside the Sun trio, rest atop sawhorses and require more agility as she stretches to reach the center of the canvas. \nKallop in her studio.  Photo by Talena Mascali/Alejandro Jassan Studio\nWhile a perfectionist at heart with a profound commitment to precision, Kallop prefers to paint without tape or a guide. “It’s too perfect,” she says. “I want that softness and that wobble, and those very slight accidents.”\nAs its name suggests, Bodies of Light reflects this methodical, physically demanding practice and, of course, speaks to the transcendent symbolism of illumination. Some pieces nod to a sort of earthly light, which dazzles as “it comes through windows or when it comes through trees,” the artist says, adding that several pieces consider photosynthesis and the process of transforming light into energy. Then there’s cosmic and celestial light—that which glimmers above on clear nights and connects distant realms through a dotted network in the sky.\nHere again, she returns to the concept of universal order and the beauty we can find in it. “I’m interested in thinking about our role in this crazy, huge, weird, wild world and what it all means,” she says. “I think there’s so much more uniting us than we realize.”\nBodies of Light runs from December 18 to January 24 in West Palm Beach.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThere’s always something a little bit unsettling about Sabrina Bockler’s dynamic paintings, although it can sometimes take a moment to narrow down the reason why. At first glance, a table appears sumptuously set, or a floral scene unfolds with brilliant hues. Upon further inspection, we’ll notice a two-headed goose, a table of food being ravaged by cats and dogs, or the disquieting feeling you’re being watched.\nBockler combines glowy, Rococo-esque figures with elements of Dutch Golden Age painting, specifically still-lifes that incorporate tables full of flowers, dead game, and decomposing fruit. She also taps into romance, allegory, and the hunting genre, portraying dogs leaping after prey or fighting with one another over scraps.\n“Through the Glass Darkly”\nA sense of chaos is always present in Bockler’s maximalist paintings, but to varying degrees. “Through the Glass Darkly,” for example, teeters on the edge of strangeness, depicting a seemingly calm tablescape with vessels full of wine interspersed among peonies, fruit, and fish. And yet, in the vein of traditional vanitas paintings, an abandoned open pomegranate suggests things are not as ideal as they seem. The plated fish stare blankly at the viewer, and mysteriously disembodied eyes peer through glasses of wine.\nIn other works, like “Beg, Borrow, and Steal,” which is currently on view in the group exhibition Symposium at Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery in West Palm Beach, “disorder” only begins to describe the anarchic scene of dogs and cats in a frenzy over a table of produce, flowers, seafood, and meat. As much as we associate these lavish scenes with refinement and wealth, there is also a disquieting undercurrent that at times bubbles up to the surface in the form of unnaturalness or even pure mania.\nBockler’s work, including a few of the pieces seen below, will go on view at Beers London in the artist’s solo exhibition titled Impending Rapture, which runs from January 15 to February 28.

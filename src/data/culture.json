    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tFebruary 26th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nSci­ence and engi­neer­ing may be con­flat­ed to some degree in the pub­lic mind, but any­one who’s spent much time in an aca­d­e­m­ic depart­ment belong­ing to one or the oth­er of those branch­es of endeav­or knows how insis­tent­ly dis­tinc­tions can be drawn between them. Bill Ham­mack, a pro­fes­sor of engi­neer­ing at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Illi­nois Urbana-Cham­paign who’s been there since he was a mas­ter’s stu­dent in 1986, sure­ly has his own thoughts on the sub­ject. The video above from his pop­u­lar YouTube chan­nel Engi­neer­guy explains how cathe­drals were designed in the Mid­dle Ages, using the exam­ple of Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. Specif­i­cal­ly, it gets into how such a build­ing’s arch­es and sup­port­ing walls could have been engi­neered with­out the aid of sci­ence at all, or even the use of math­e­mat­ics.\nCom­pared to today, the scope of knowl­edge human­i­ty com­mand­ed back in medieval times may have been impos­si­bly nar­row — to say noth­ing of the knowl­edge pos­sessed by any giv­en human, espe­cial­ly out­side the lit­er­ate elite. Yet what was then known proved more than suf­fi­cient to build struc­tures that still stand, and indeed impress, many cen­turies (and in some cas­es, more than a mil­len­ni­um) lat­er.\nHam­mack explains that, in the place of mak­ing cal­cu­la­tions, their builders would per­form actions. For instance, a medieval mason would have made a life-size chalk draw­ing of the arch, laid a rope along its form, and cut the rope’s length to match that of the arch. He could then use the rope to deter­mine just how thick the wall would need to be, between a fourth and a fifth of the arch’s span, with­out a num­ber ever being involved.\nHam­mack notes that the Romans, too, under­stood this nec­es­sary pro­por­tion for arch con­struc­tion. “The pro­por­tion­al rule does­n’t come from some sci­en­tif­ic analy­sis of stone and its prop­er­ties,” he says. “It comes from cen­turies of expe­ri­ence, from tri­al and error.” Such heuris­tics, or rules of thumb, con­sti­tute “an impre­cise method used as a short­cut to find a solu­tion to a prob­lem, often by nar­row­ing the range of pos­si­ble solu­tions.” They’re also employed in the engi­neer­ing method to “cause the best change in a poor­ly under­stood sit­u­a­tion using avail­able resources.” Its thor­ough­go­ing prac­ti­cal­i­ty would seem to have lit­tle to do with the dif­fer­ent sort of rig­ors that apply in sci­ence, where estab­lish­ing truth, or at least the absence of false­ness, is all. Belief in the engi­neer­ing approach to prob­lems like this does­n’t require faith in the reli­gious sense, but if you like, you can find proof of its effec­tive­ness in hous­es of wor­ship from Sainte-Chapelle to the Pan­theon to Hagia Sophia — or at least in their arch­es.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nGöbek­li Tepe: The 12,000-Year-Old Ruins That Rewrite the Sto­ry of Civ­i­liza­tion\nThe Cre­ation & Restora­tion of Notre-Dame Cathe­dral, Ani­mat­ed\nAn Ani­mat­ed Video Shows the Build­ing of a Medieval Bridge: 45 Years of Con­struc­tion in 3 Min­utes\nBehold a 21st-Cen­tu­ry Medieval Cas­tle Being Built with Only Tools & Mate­ri­als from the Mid­dle Ages\nHow Design­ing Build­ings Upside-Down Rev­o­lu­tion­ized Archi­tec­ture, Mak­ing Pos­si­ble St. Paul’s Cathe­dral, Sagra­da Família & More\nThe Longest Con­struc­tion Projects in His­to­ry: Why Sagra­da Família, the Milan Duo­mo, Greek Tem­ples & Oth­er Famous Struc­tures Took Gen­er­a­tions to Com­plete\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWel­come to The Gar­den of Earth­ly Delights.\nYou’ll find no angel­ic strings here.\nThose are reserved for first-class cit­i­zens whose vir­tu­ous lives earned them pas­sage to the upper­most heights.\nDown below, stringed instru­ments pro­duce the most hell­ish sort of cacoph­o­ny, a fit­ting accom­pa­ni­ment for the horn whose bell is befouled with the arm of a tor­tured soul.\nHow do we know that’s what they sound­ed like?\nA group of musi­col­o­gists, crafts­peo­ple and aca­d­e­mics from the Bate Col­lec­tion of Musi­cal Instru­ments at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Oxford, took it upon them­selves to actu­al­ly build the instru­ments depict­ed in Hierony­mus Bosch’s action-packed trip­tych—the hell harp, the vio­lat­ed lute, the gross­ly over­sized hur­dy-gur­dy…\n…And then they played them.\n\nLet us hope they stopped shy of shov­ing flutes up their bums. (Such a place­ment might pro­duce a sound, but not from the flute’s gold­en throat).\nThe Bosch exper­i­ment added ten more instru­ments to the museum’s already impres­sive, over 1000-strong col­lec­tion of wood­winds, per­cus­sion, and brass, many from the stu­dios of esteemed mak­ers, some dat­ing all the way back to the Renais­sance.\nUnfor­tu­nate­ly, the new addi­tions don’t sound very good. “Hor­ri­ble” and “painful” are among the adjec­tives the Bate Col­lec­tion man­ag­er Andrew Lamb uses to describe the aur­al fruits of his team’s months-long labors.\nMight we assume Bosch would have want­ed it that way?\nBran­don McWilliams, the wag behind Bosch’s wild­ly enthu­si­as­tic, f‑bomb-laced review of thrash met­al band Slayer’s 1986 Reign in Blood album, would sure­ly say yes, as would Alden and Cali Hack­mann, North Amer­i­can hur­dy-gur­dy mak­ers, who note that Bosch’s painter­ly des­e­cra­tions were not lim­it­ed to their per­son­al favorite instru­ment:\nBosch and his con­tem­po­raries viewed music as sin­ful, asso­ci­at­ing it with oth­er sins of the flesh and spir­it. A num­ber of oth­er instru­ments are also depict­ed: a harp, a drum, a shawm, a recorder, and the met­al tri­an­gle being played by the woman (a nun, per­haps) who is appar­ent­ly impris­oned in the key­box of the instru­ment. The hur­dy-gur­dy was also asso­ci­at­ed with beg­gars, who were often blind. The man turn­ing the crank is hold­ing a beg­ging bowl in his oth­er hand. Hang­ing from the bowl is a met­al seal on a rib­bon, called a “gaber­lun­zie.” This was a license to beg in a par­tic­u­lar town on a par­tic­u­lar day, grant­ed by the nobil­i­ty. Sol­diers who were blind­ed or maimed in their lord’s ser­vice might be giv­en a gaber­lun­zie in rec­om­pense.\nTo the best of our knowl­edge, no gaber­lun­zies were grant­ed, nor any sin­ners eter­nal­ly damned, in the Bate Collection’s caper. Accord­ing to man­ag­er Lamb, expand­ing the bound­aries of music edu­ca­tion was rec­om­pense enough, well worth the tem­po­rary affront to ten­der ears.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHear the Song Writ­ten on a Sinner’s But­tock in Hierony­mus Bosch’s Paint­ing The Gar­den of Earth­ly Delights\nThe Mean­ing of Hierony­mus Bosch’s The Gar­den of Earth­ly Delights Explained\nTake a Vir­tu­al Tour of Hierony­mus Bosch’s Bewil­der­ing Mas­ter­piece The Gar­den of Earth­ly Delights\nThe Hierony­mus Bosch Demon Bird Was Spot­ted Rid­ing the New York City Sub­way the Oth­er Day…\nHierony­mus Bosch Fig­urines: Col­lect Sur­re­al Char­ac­ters from Bosch’s Paint­ings & Put Them on Your Book­shelf\nAyun Hal­l­i­day is an author, illus­tra­tor, the­ater mak­er and Chief Pri­ma­tol­o­gist of the East Vil­lage Inky zine.  \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tFebruary 27th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nA vast, mis­er­able pro­le­tari­at squan­ders its days in mean­ing­less toil. Soci­ety is under the con­trol of ultra-wealthy busi­ness mag­nates. In order to paci­fy the under­class, the rul­ing class pins its hopes on a tech­no­log­i­cal solu­tion: arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence. Wel­come to the year 2026, as envi­sioned in Fritz Lang’s Metrop­o­lis. When the film pre­miered, not long after 1926 had come to an end, that date would have seemed arbi­trar­i­ly futur­is­tic. Now, of course, it’s the present, though our world may nowhere look quite as styl­ish as the Art Deco dystopia craft­ed at great expense and an unprece­dent­ed scale of pro­duc­tion by Lang and com­pa­ny. Yet when we watch Metrop­o­lis today, the ele­ments that now seem pre­scient stand out more than the fan­tas­ti­cal ones.\nThe new short doc­u­men­tary from DW above exam­ines the mak­ing and lega­cy of Metrop­o­lis, pay­ing spe­cial atten­tion to its con­sid­er­able influ­ence on much of the sci­ence-fic­tion and dystopi­an cin­e­ma since. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Blade Run­ner, Ter­mi­na­tor 2, Madon­na’s “Express Your­self” video: these are just a few of the pro­duc­tions that take no great pains to hide — and in some cas­es, even empha­size — their debt to Lang’s vision.\nVer­tig­i­nous, inten­sive­ly illu­mi­nat­ed, infra­struc­ture-webbed sky­scraper canyons and labor­ers at once manip­u­lat­ing and being manip­u­lat­ed by over­sized clock­work are only the most obvi­ous images that have come down through decades of pop­u­lar cul­ture. For the ori­gin of the wild-haired “mad sci­en­tist” sur­round­ed by tubes and coils, look no fur­ther than Metrop­o­lis’ Rot­wang.\nMuch could also be writ­ten — and indeed, much already has been writ­ten — about the lega­cy of Rot­wang’s inven­tion, the robot woman who takes on the like­ness of a work­ing-class hero­ine. Beyond the ground­break­ing nature of its design, Metrop­o­lis has also retained atten­tion after near­ly a cen­tu­ry thanks to the folk­loric, even myth­i­cal res­o­nances of its sto­ry. It may be tech­ni­cal­ly implau­si­ble, at least from our point of view, to imag­ine large-scale automa­tion coex­ist­ing with large-scale employ­ment, how­ev­er dire the jobs, but age-old nar­ra­tive under­cur­rents allow even mod­ern audi­ences to sus­pend dis­be­lief (a phe­nom­e­non that has­n’t gone unno­ticed by the mak­ers of more recent sci-fi and fan­ta­sy block­busters). We may not live in quite the 2026  that Metrop­o­lis puts onscreen, but in some sense, we do inhab­it the world it made.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe 1927 Film Metrop­o­lis Cre­at­ed a Dystopi­an Vision of What the World Would Look Like in 2026 — and It Hits Close to Home\nFritz Lang First Depict­ed Arti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence on Film in Metrop­o­lis (1927), and It Fright­ened Peo­ple Even Then\nFritz Lang Invents the Video Phone in Metrop­o­lis (1927)\nRead the Orig­i­nal 32-Page Pro­gram for Fritz Lang’s Metrop­o­lis (1927)\nHow Movies Cre­at­ed Their Spe­cial Effects Before CGI: Metrop­o­lis, 2001: A Space Odyssey & More\nH.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAfter more than two decades as a commercial textile designer, often working digitally, Amy Gross was drawn to making something that felt more immediate and tactile. “I started making beaded jewelry, something I could hold and feel,” she tells Colossal.\nThe beading techniques gradually merged with canvases, which over time became more three-dimensional. They were “less about adornment and more about personal stories I felt I needed to tell,” she says. These eventually became sculptural objects, representative of the natural world that has long been a source of wonder and curiosity for the artist.\n“Aggregating Vivarium”\nGross’ imaginative compositions of flora, fungi, and sometimes even fauna tap into her fascination with scale. In her practice, it’s “not about size, it’s about what is most important to you,” she says. “It’s how we see and think and remember.” Beads, thread, yarn, and paper transform into otherworldly, miniature biomes. \nThe artist focuses on mushrooms, roots, leaves, blossoms, and tiny critters as a meditation on our planet’s smallest denizens. She also incorporates motifs evocative of elements we typically can’t comprehend with the naked eye, such as spores, pollen, viruses, molecules, and cells. “To my mind’s eye, they are of equal importance,” she says. “The health of the world we see is deeply dependent on the health of the tiniest elements.”\nGross’ work is currently on view in two shows at Momentum Gallery in Asheville, which also represents the artist. In late 2027, her work will be included in a group exhibition at the Fuller Craft Museum in Brockton, Massachusetts, and one of her sculptures will be featured in a forthcoming book published by Phaidon about fungi. See more of the artist’s work on Instagram.\n“Evada Dolor”\n“Taraxa Contineo”\n“Mycorrhiza Web”\n“Broodnest Vivarium 2”\n“Towhee”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

His newest work, “Strange Light,” is a mesmerizing one-minute animation conceived as a loop, drawn with ink and Wite-Out, then digitally enhanced with otherworldly, glowing hues.\nAn electric green pervades the scenes, dominated by eyes and motifs related to the act of viewing, augmented occasionally with pinks and other pastels.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe second cut on disc 39 of his most recent double album, “The Fall-Off Is Inevitable” unfolds J. Cole’s life and professional career through a backward-moving narrative. Directed by Palestinian-American filmmaker Ryan Doubiago, the track’s accompanying music video visually captures the feeling of reminiscence, as the rapper looks back on his journey thus far.\nThough each scene takes place within the same studio walls through a looping cycle, viewers move through a multitude of defining moments: a funeral scene, a wedding, writing music in solitude, and rewatching home videos from 1992. Because it’s shot on film, the grain and warm color grading strengthen the through line of nostalgia and memory.\n\n\n\n“For the past 10 years, this album has been hand crafted with one intention: a personal challenge to myself to create my best work,” the musician states in the video’s opening slate. “To do on my last what I was unable to do on my first.” \nAt the video’s close, he looks back as a stream of studio equipment floats behind him, tying together a full-circle ending. The Fall-Off is Cole’s seventh and final album, and he is evidently taking it all in—down to selling CDs out of his Honda Civic trunk again, for $1. \nWatch more of Ryan Doubiago’s work on Vimeo, and keep up with his projects on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom dramatic aquatic encounters to deep caves to fish and amphibians closely guarding their eggs, there’s an entire world below the surface that few of us ever really get to see. That’s where images like those in the annual Underwater Photographer of the Year (UPY) come in, glimpsing some of the darkest depths and most alluring and fragile ecosystems on the planet.\nThe top prize of the 2026 competition, which has been running annually since 1965, goes to Matthew Smith for his capture of two young sea lions in the Falkland Islands. Additional winning images include Natalie Yarrow’s tableau of hinge-beak shrimp inside a pink barrel sponge, Khaichuin Sim’s observation of the controversial annual whale hunt in the Faroe Islands, and Sam Blount’s dramatic encounter with a leopard seal.\n© Kirsty Andrews (U.K.), “Dusk Encounter,” Porthkerris, Cornwall, U.K. Runner-up in the British Waters Wide Angle category\nUPY’s categories range from portraits to coral reefs to macro images, all with an emphasis on the diversity, beauty, and vulnerability of the vast parts of our submerged world. We’ve shared a selection of our favorites here, but you can see the entire winners’ gallery on UPY’s website, and follow updates on Instagram.\n© Anton Sorokin (U.S.), “Egg Clutcher,” San Francisco Bay Area, California, U.S. Third place in the Behavior category\n© Dan Bolt (U.K.), “New Life,” Manse Point, U.K. Third place in the British Waters Macro category\n© Simon Theuma (Australia), “A Time to Dream,” The Gutter, Shellharbour, NSW, Australia.

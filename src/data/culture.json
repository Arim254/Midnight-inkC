    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nThe names Leo Fend­er and Les Paul will be for­ev­er asso­ci­at­ed with the explo­sion of the elec­tric gui­tar into pop­u­lar cul­ture. And right­ly so. With­out engi­neer Fend­er and musi­cian and stu­dio wiz Paul’s time­less designs, it’s hard to imag­ine what the most icon­ic instru­ments of decades of pop­u­lar music would look like.\nThey just might look like fry­ing pans.\nThough Fend­er and Paul (and the Gib­son com­pa­ny) get all the glo­ry, it’s two men named George who should right­ly get much of the cred­it for invent­ing the elec­tric gui­tar. The first, naval offi­cer George Breed, has a sta­tus vis-à-vis the elec­tric gui­tar sim­i­lar to Leonar­do da Vinci’s to the heli­copter.\nIn 1890, Breed sub­mit­ted a patent for a one-of-a-kind design, uti­liz­ing the two basic ele­ments that would even­tu­al­ly make their way into Stra­to­cast­ers and Les Pauls—a mag­net­ic pick­up and wire strings. Unfor­tu­nate­ly for Breed, his design also includ­ed some very imprac­ti­cal cir­cuit­ry and required bat­tery oper­a­tion, “result­ing in a small but extreme­ly heavy gui­tar with an uncon­ven­tion­al play­ing tech­nique,” writes the Inter­na­tion­al Reper­to­ry of Music Lit­er­a­ture, “that pro­duced an excep­tion­al­ly unusu­al and ungui­tar­like, con­tin­u­ous­ly sus­tained sound.”\n\n\n\t\n\nLike a Renais­sance fly­ing machine, the design went nowhere. That is, until George Beauchamp, a “musi­cian and tin­ker­er” from Texas, came up with a design for an elec­tric gui­tar pick­up that worked beau­ti­ful­ly. The first “Fry­ing Pan Hawai­ian” lap steel gui­tar, whose schemat­ic you can see at the top of the post, “now sits in a case in a muse­um,” writes Andre Mil­lard in his his­to­ry of the elec­tric gui­tar, “look­ing every inch the his­toric arti­fact but not much like a gui­tar.” Giz­mo­do quotes gui­tar his­to­ri­an Richard Smith, who dis­cuss­es the need in the 20s and 30s for an elec­tric gui­tar to be heard over the rhythm instru­ments in jazz and in Beauchamp’s pre­ferred style, Hawai­ian music, “where… the gui­tar was the melody instru­ment. So the real push to make the gui­tar elec­tric came from the Hawai­ian musi­cians.”\n\n\n\t\n\nBeauchamp devel­oped the gui­tar after he was fired as gen­er­al man­ag­er of the Nation­al String Instru­ment Cor­po­ra­tion. Need­ing a new project, he and anoth­er Nation­al employ­ee, Paul Barth, began exper­i­ment­ing with Breed’s ideas. After build­ing a work­ing pick­up, they called on anoth­er Nation­al employ­ee, writes Rickenbacker.com, “to make a wood­en neck and body for it. In sev­er­al hours, carv­ing with small hand tools, a rasp, and a file, the first ful­ly elec­tric gui­tar took form.” (An ear­li­er elec­tro-acoustic gui­tar—the Stromberg Elec­tro—con­tributed to ampli­fi­er tech­nol­o­gy but its awk­ward pick­up design didn’t catch on.)\n\n\n\t\n\nNeed­ing cap­i­tal, man­u­fac­tur­ing, and dis­tri­b­u­tion, Beauchamp con­tract­ed with tool­mak­er Adolph Rick­en­backer, who mass pro­duced the Fry­ing Pan as “The Rick­en­bach­er A‑22″ under the com­pa­ny name “Elec­tro String.” (The com­pa­ny became Rick­en­backer Gui­tars after its own­er sold it in the 50s.) Although the nov­el­ty of the instru­ment and its cost dur­ing the Great Depres­sion inhib­it­ed sales, Beauchamp and Rick­en­backer still pro­duced sev­er­al ver­sions of the Fry­ing Pan, with cast alu­minum bod­ies rather than wood. (See an ear­ly mod­el here.) Soon, the Fry­ing Pan became inte­grat­ed into live jazz bands (see it at the 3:34 mark above in a 1936 Adolph Zukor short film) and record­ings.\n\n\n\t\n\nHow does the Fry­ing Pan sound? Aston­ish­ing­ly good, as you can hear for your­self in the demon­stra­tion videos above. Although Rick­en­backer and oth­er gui­tar mak­ers moved on to installing pick­ups in so-called “Span­ish” guitars—hollow-bodied jazz box­es with their famil­iar f‑holes—the Fry­ing Pan lap steel con­tin­ues to have a par­tic­u­lar mys­tique in gui­tar his­to­ry, and was man­u­fac­tured and sold into the ear­ly 1950s.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe next leap for­ward in elec­tric gui­tar design? After the Fry­ing Pan came Les Paul’s first ful­ly solid­body elec­tric: The Log.\nLearn More about the inven­tion of the elec­tric gui­tar in the short Smith­son­ian video just above.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Evo­lu­tion of the Elec­tric Gui­tar: An Intro­duc­tion to Every Major Vari­ety of the Instru­ment That Made Rock-and-Roll\nThe His­to­ry of the Elec­tric Gui­tar Solo: A Sev­en-Part Series\nOxford Sci­en­tist Explains the Physics of Play­ing Elec­tric Gui­tar Solos\nHear the Bril­liant Gui­tar Work of Char­lie Chris­t­ian, Inven­tor of the Elec­tric Gui­tar Solo (1939)\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.

(photo by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThieves stole “priceless” jewels from a gallery in the Louvre Museum in Paris in broad daylight on Sunday, October 19.\nLaurent Nuñez, France’s interior minister, told France Inter that burglars broke into the Galerie d’Apollon around 9:30am, half an hour after the museum opened to the public, and made off with the pieces in a span of just seven minutes before fleeing on motorcycles.\nThe Louvre’s d’Apollon gallery is known for its opulent displays of France’s crown jewels. Among the eight stolen items, according to a list from the Ministry of Culture shared with Hyperallergic, are several pieces from an early 19th-century set belonging to Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, including a sapphire and diamond tiara. A pair of emerald earrings and matching necklace, gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise of Austria on the occasion of their marriage, were also taken.\n“Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value,” a spokesperson for the Louvre said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “All possible measures are being taken to recover the stolen items.”\nOne of the jewels targeted by the thieves — the diamond-encrusted crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III — was later recovered outside the museum. However, the burglars managed to make off with Eugénie’s pearl and diamond tiara.\nThe Galerie d’Apollon at the Louvre Museum (photo by Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe Louvre spokesperson said that no injuries were reported, and that the French government has enlisted a specialized police force to investigate the robbery. The Louvre remained closed on Sunday “as a security measure and to preserve evidence for the investigation.”\nThe thieves allegedly used a mechanical ladder known as a basket lift to access the second-floor gallery, forced a window, and smashed the display cases in what Nuñez described as an expert operation executed by professionals. Five security officers were present in the gallery at the time, the Ministry of Culture’s statement said.\n“We saw some footage, they don’t target people, they enter calmly in four minutes, smash display cases, take their loot, and leave. No violence, very professional,” Culture Minister Rachida Dati told the French news channel TF1.\nTourists in line to enter the museum this morning told the BBC that security guards quickly ushered them out shortly after the incident. \nFrench police officers stand next to a mechanical ladder used by robbers to break into the Louvre Museum, on Quai Francois Mitterrand, in Paris on October 19, 2025. (photo by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe Louvre, which is the world’s most visited museum, drawing approximately 30,000 visitors per day, is no stranger to art heists. In 1911, one of its own employees notoriously made off with the Mona Lisa. He was arrested years later and the painting was returned. More recently, in 1998, a painting by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was snatched directly from a wall. It has never been found.\nToday’s incident comes just months after a mass work stoppage shuttered the museum for several hours this summer, with striking employees citing poor working conditions, overcrowding, and staff shortages at the iconic institution. \nEarlier this year, President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a decade-long renovation project that would revitalize the Louvre’s outdated infrastructure and create a dedicated gallery for the Mona Lisa, the museum’s top tourist draw. The overhaul plan also includes a “new security master plan,” the Ministry of Culture said today, including enhanced safety measures and perimeter detection technology.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValentina Di Liscia is the News Editor at Hyperallergic.

Rubin/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nWhat makes a seascape? In this focus exhibition of 10 recent paintings at the Museum of Contemporary Art, veteran Los Angeles artist Takako Yamaguchi subverts the traditional notion. Rather than base her imagery on observations of the natural world, she takes the opposite approach and practices what she calls “abstraction in reverse.” Recognizing that early European and American Modernists derived their geometric or organic forms from nature, she instead begins by using abstract shapes to construct calm seascapes, with horizon lines bisecting each composition into two equal sections. She superimposes additional abstract imagery reflecting her love of pattern and decoration, fashion, and her concept of beauty, some loaded with symbolic associations.\nIn “Stitch” (2023), a brown rectangle suggests the presence of a beachfront, the ocean is divided into horizontal registers made up of undulating lines and interlocking zigzags, and clouds have been replaced by an expansive braid that the walls points out recalls a close-up of those feminized materials of hair or fabric. Easily perceived as separate elements, Yamaguchi’s abstract and figurative configurations do not really interact. Rather, they peacefully coexist as two worlds in one, as nature and culture.\n\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Trap” (2024), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 60 × 40 inches (152.4 × 101.6 cm)\nYamaguchi’s image lexicon also includes architectural columns, fountains, and geometric patterns derived from historical Japanese art, as in Ukiyo-e prints or folding screens. The latter influence is particularly evident in “Trap” (2024), where swirling cloud formations inhabit the sky and rhythmic waves swirl in the center like the codependent halves of a yin-yang symbol. A similar effect is at play in “Accomplice” (2025), where two Greek columns have been whimsically anthropomorphized such that they appear to be snuggling.\nIndeed, Yamaguchi is at her best when letting her imagination run rampant. This might be most clearly seen in her fantastic biomorphic creatures that seem to have risen from the ocean depths, blocking our views of distant horizons. Hybrids of architectural motifs and feminine symbols, such as flowing hair or wombs, the vibrant, energetic biomorphs in “Guide” (2023), “Pilot” (2024), and “Plenum” (2024) occupy entire foregrounds, commanding our attention like actors on a stage, the seascape behind functioning like a scenic backdrop. Delightfully surreal, these creatures evoke associations with Japanese anime and classic horror films. By contrast, the decorative structures in “Procession” and “Font” (both 2024) function more like gateways through which we can envision journeying across the waters. \nMelding abstraction with figuration through an idiosyncratic language that draws from Euroamerican Modernism and Japanese woodblock prints and pop culture alike, Yamaguchi effectively liberates herself from such distinctions, creating fresh compositions that are at once serene and animated.\n\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Guide” (2023), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 42 × 50 inches (106.7 × 127 cm)\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Font” (2024), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 60 × 40 inches (152.4 × 101.6 cm)\nTakako Yamaguchi, “Accomplice” (2025), oil and metal leaf on canvas, 50 × 42 inches (127 × 106.7 cm)\nMOCA Focus: Takako Yamaguchi continues at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (250 South Grand Avenue, Downtown Los Angeles) through January 4, 2026.

The proposed arch would stand across from the Lincoln Memorial and welcome visitors leaving Arlington National Cemetery, ostensibly in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of American independence next year. (The arch will reportedly be paid for using leftovers from Trump’s $250 million ballroom fund.) Although officially called the “Independence Arch,” the nickname “Arc de Trump” has taken hold, referencing a strong resemblance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Trump’s proposed arch is the latest development in the history of the infamously imperialistic architectural form, which stretches back to Roman antiquity. It also continues his fascination with neoclassical architecture and material attempts to draw connections between himself and the emperors and military generals of Ancient Rome. \nNews of the proposed arch only began to emerge on October 9, when a model first appeared on Trump’s Oval Office desk. But on September 4, architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau shared a viral tweet with the phrase “America needs a triumphal arch!” and an artistic rendering of the structure with a winged statue of the goddess Victory — later referred to by Trump as “Lady Liberty” — flanked by two eagles. Charbonneau’s design firm, Sacred Architecture Studio at Harrison Design, specializes in the use of neoclassical architecture for religious buildings. In an interview with the Catholic Herald last year, Charbonneau noted that his firm is “founded on principles that align with the teaching of the Catholic Church.”\nThough details are still murky, what is clear are the origins of the triumphal arch. Archaeologists and art historians have identified over 800 freestanding Roman arches across the former Roman Empire. The form was developed during the Roman Republic, almost 200 years before the first Roman emperor, Augustus, came to power. The most popular reason for erecting a freestanding arch was to commemorate a major military victory known as a Roman triumph, the highest military accolade for a conquering general. The word itself comes from the Latin arcus (“arch”), but when the structures emerged in the 2nd century BCE, Romans called them fornices. A general named Lucius Stertinius, who had three constructed following his campaigns in Hispania Ulterior (a region in present-day Spain), allegedly used 50,000 pounds of silver of his own money to have them built. Eventually, over 50 such arches dotted the landscape of the Eternal City by the end of Roman antiquity, often serving as symbols of Roman military supremacy and provincial subjugation. \n\nThe Arch of Titus on the Upper Via Sacra in Rome, Italy (photo by Carole Raddato, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Flickr)\nWhile not all arches commemorated the achievement of a Roman triumph, many did. Augustus had a triumphal arch voted to him by the Senate during his reign, as did several successive emperors including Septimius Severus and Constantine. Perhaps the best-known Roman arch today is the Arch of Titus at the entrance to the Forum, near the Colosseum. Then-Emperor  Domitian had the arch built beginning in 81 CE to commemorate the achievements of his deceased brother, Titus, who destroyed the Second Temple at Jerusalem. Titus enslaved thousands of Jewish people and brought them to Rome during his father’s reign, likely to help build the Colosseum. The relief of the menorah being pillaged from the Second Temple is perhaps the most famous relief on a Roman triumphal arch, and was later used as a model for the Israeli state’s emblem not long after the occupation of Palestine began. It also has an eagle carrying Titus to heaven in apotheosis at the apex of the arch, with the goddess victory on the spandrels.\nInto the 4th century CE and the creation of the Arch of Constantine in 315 CE, it was still standard protocol to receive the imprimatur of the Senate before beginning construction. Many arches bore an inscription celebrating the Senatus Populusque Romanus (“Senate and Roman People”) and noting it had been voted by the Senate to the emperor. Even many centuries later, the arch continued to represent imperialism and grant prestige to the victorious general, whether or not it was formally stated. Plans for the Arc de Triomphe at the end of the Champs-Elysées in Paris indicate that the structure was based in part on the Arch of Titus and the Arch of Constantine at Rome and created at Napoleon’s behest. Although officially dedicated to the victories of France’s Grande Armée, the first stones were laid down on the French emperor’s birthday, August 15, 1806.\n\nAlfred Bastien’s “Canadians Passing in Front of the Arc de Triomphe” (c. 1919), a painting of Canadian troops on parade under the Red Ensign at Paris’s Arc de Triomphe, part of an Allied victory parade on July 14, 1919 (image public domain via the Canadian War Museum, Toronto, Canada)\nThere are a number of iconic triumphal arches in the United States today. The most recognizable is arguably the Washington Square Arch, which serves as a symbol of Greenwich Village in New York City. The arch was built in 1892 to commemorate George Washington’s centennial. Across the country, arches commemorate everything from veterans to peace. But their official symbolism often contradicts their historical reality. The Millennium Gate Museum in Atlanta has a 101-foot-tall (~30.8-meter-tall) arch based on the Arch of Titus meant to celebrate peace, despite the fact that Titus killed and enslaved thousands of Jews during the Jewish-Roman War. Triumphal arches maintain their message of autocratic authority most shrewdly when tied to a single, living individual. \nOver the course of seven months, Trump has undertaken myriad actions most often associated with monarchies and dictatorships than with democratic republics. His military parade on his birthday in June looked more like a Roman triumph than an anniversary procession. His proposal to mint $1 coins with his face on it for the nation’s upcoming 250th anniversary also appears to be in conflict with the 1866 Coin Act barring a living person from appearing on US currency, securities, and notes. The act was meant to differentiate American coinage from that of governments like Britain, who place their living monarch on coinage. The proposed “Arch de Trump” is also in alignment with his use of Executive Orders to champion neoclassical architecture as a way of returning to the aesthetics of the Founding Fathers.\nTriumphal arches carry the memory of the figures they monumentalized and the autocrats who built them. Hitler envisioned one with his head architect, Albert Speer, for his vision of Welthauptstadt Germania. Trump’s plan for the creation of a neoclassical arch near the Lincoln Monument is undoubtedly an attempt to proclaim the president’s own perceived victories. The arch may be thinly cast as a monument to American independence, but one might wish to whisper in Trump’s ear what was said to triumphing Roman generals in their parade: “Memento mori.” Remember that you are a man and not a god.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSarah E.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCrowds near works by Margarita Cabrera at the opening of 30 X 30: A Selection of Thirty Artists Over Thirty Years at Jane Lombard Gallery on September 5, 2025 (photo courtesy Kevin Czopek/BFA)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nWhen Jane Lombard started her career in the art world in the 1990s, she was part of a delegation that traveled to Poland to help Eastern European artists show their work in the United States just before the Cold War ended.\nThree decades later, Lombard sat at her desk at her gallery in New York City’s Tribeca neighborhood, discussing how she would join hundreds of thousands of Americans to protest against the nation’s creeping authoritarianism at the No Kings Day parade this coming Saturday, October 18.\n“We don’t have those issues here, but they’re coming. Look at Chicago, they’re fighting back,” she told Hyperallergic, referring to President Trump’s attempts to deploy the national guard in Illinois.\n\nJane Lombard (photo Hrag Vartanian/Hyperallergic)\nAt a time when the contemporary art world appears to be swerving away from politics, with some institutions quietly abandoning exhibitions that challenge the current administration’s views, Lombard knows that all politics are personal. Her current exhibition 30 X 30: A Selection of Thirty Artists Over Thirty Years, which opened September 5, is a reflection of the art she has enjoyed the most, reflecting an incisive, sometimes bracing, sociopolitical message.\nIt’s also a homecoming for dozens of artists whom Lombard has represented and shown in her gallery spaces in SoHo, Chelsea, and Tribeca, where she relocated to 58 White Street in 2020. They hail from more than a dozen countries, including China, Taiwan, Morocco, Turkey, Myanmar, and some from which they have fled in exile, but share several commonalities.\n“A lot of artists explore their identities and the countries they are from in their work,” said Mána Taylor, a press liaison for the gallery. “Some works delve into architectural elements and landscapes, while others look at the body in a more subtle way.”\n\nHoward Smith, “Quasigrid #15” (2009–10) (photo Aaron Short/Hyperallergic)\nThe show includes a twinkling 2023 sculpture of multi-colored crystal glass in the shape of an apostrophe by Via Lewandowsky, an artist Lombard showed at her first exhibition in 1995. He called the work “Brilliance of Omission” because the apostrophe is used as a placeholder to avoid writing the word “God” in Hebrew texts. \nNearby is Mounir Fatmi’s 2016 installation of 14 skateboards upholstered with Islamic prayer rugs, titled “Maximum Sensation.” Fatmi arranged the plush skateboards in a bell curve pattern to show what a kick-flip trick would look like in slow-motion, a commentary on the near-religious devotion of skaters and the cross-pollination of pop culture in America and the Muslim world.\n\n\n\nVia Lewandowsky, “Brilliance of Omission” (2023) and Richard Ibghy and Marilou Lemmens, “Mastermind” (2022) (photos Aaron Short/Hyperallergic)\nThe most political piece in the show may be Margarita Cabrera’s fabric sculptures of potted cacti made in the center of the room. Cabrera hosted workshops in El Paso in 2016 with recent undocumented immigrants who embroidered stars and other symbols on the leaves of fake cacti that she assembled with scraps of border patrol uniforms. Her art assistants aren’t named in the gallery’s label in order to protect their identities. Cabrera’s politics are not contained to her artworks: She and fellow artist Nicholas Galanin recently withdrew from a symposium at the Smithsonian Institution that had been made private and invitation-only, a decision that Cabrera called “quiet censorship.”\nNear the back of the gallery, Richard Ibghy and Marilou Lemmens’s 12-inch yellow ceramic sculpture that resembles an upside-down pair of jeans sits on a pedestal. The 2022 work, called “Mastermind,” depicted strategic rips and tears on the jeans that stand for Morse code, which were used by opponents of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to communicate secret messages.\n\nMounir Fatmi, “Maximum Sensa:on Suspended” (2016) on view at Jane Lombard Gallery (photo Aaron Short/Hyperallergic)\nDownstairs, visitors will find two striking pieces by 21st-century Chinese artists who straddle the real and virtual worlds. Beijing artist Cao Fei’s digital print “RMB CITY 1” (2007) shows the skyline of a fictional Chinese city created in the online multiplayer game Second Life, surrounded by rising seas. If you look closely, you’ll see the Beijing National Stadium among the skyscrapers.\nLu Yang, who lives in Tokyo, also explores the overlap between faith and video game avatars. His 2022 light box image, “DOKU – The Matrix #2” contains several facsimiles of the artist dressed to symbolize the different Buddhist realms of existence. Jane Lombard is one of the first in the US to show his work, the gallery said.\nSome works have a unique personal connection to Lombard, too. Mark Bradford’s 2002 mixed-media work “Nasty Ass Pigeons” includes scores of heat-resistant endpapers attached to the canvas in reference to his mother’s work as a hairdresser. That year, he created an installation of a working beauty shop at Art Basel Miami Beach called “Foxyé Hair,” where he and his team would style visitors’ hair.\n“That’s where Jane had her red streak done that she still has today,” Taylor said.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAaron Short is a Brooklyn-based journalist covering politics, criminal justice, real estate, the environment, and the arts. His work has appeared in New York Magazine, the New York Post, The Daily Beast,...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore by Aaron Short\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“Pot of Flowers Quilt with Birds,” detail (c. 1860), cotton and wool (all photos Julie Schneider/Hyperallergic)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe fiber arts are experiencing renewed and rigorous recognition. Last year, for instance, modern and contemporary weaving loomed large in major exhibitions in the United States, which explored the craft’s ancient roots and impact on modern art, alongside high-profile shows around the world devoted to artworks made from fabric and thread. As writer-historian Glenn Adamson proclaimed, 2024 was the year that “the art world went on a high fiber diet.” \nThis year, amid a slate of shows exploring the rich possibilities of fabric, American quilts are having a moment in art museums from coast to coast. In-depth exhibitions showcase the craftsmanship and ingenuity of regional quilting communities in Routed West: Twentieth-Century African American Quilts in California at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (through November 30) and Of Salt and Spirit: Black Quilters in the American South at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art (through January 4, 2026). Similarly, the 2024–25 exhibition Patterns in Abstraction: Black Quilts from the High’s Collection at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta spotlighted artful quilts from the institution’s permanent collection, all stitched by Black women. Unraveling the narrative potential of quilts, Fabric of a Nation: American Quilt Stories From the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston at the Frist Art Museum in Nashville recently related the country’s histories through textiles, and Indigo and the Art of Quiltmaking at the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati (through January 11, 2026) focuses on global dye traditions.\n\nDyestuff samples and natural dye fabric swatches on display in An Ecology of Quilts: The Natural History of American Textiles at the American Folk Art Museum \nAdding a biophilic perspective to the mix, the American Folk Art Museum opened An Ecology of Quilts: The Natural History of American Textiles in late September, marking the museum’s reopening after a summer-long closure for renovations. Featuring 30 quilts from the 18th through the 20th century, the exhibition explores the bountiful ways that nature, industry, and quilt making entangle. Rather than emphasizing the quilters’ identities, it examines the relationships between natural and human-powered systems and processes, starting at the roots of quilt making: the lifeforms (plants, animals, insects) necessary to produce fabric — and, therefore, quilts.\nAn Ecology of Quilts opens with a trio of whole-cloth quilts: one an all-white field of cotton fabric embellished with patterns of raised dots and florals (“Cornucopia and Dots Whitework Quilt,” c. 1800–1820) contrasted by two brightly colored examples. On the opposite wall, botanical illustrations and vials of common, traditional dyestuffs, including insects (cochineal) and dried plant matter, introduce the fundamentals of natural dye, used to color the two vibrant quilts that start the show. A gradient of fabric swatches highlights the brilliance of the extracted hues: indigo (deep blue), madder root (bright red), and weld (golden yellow). Through an adjoining doorway, a case displays silk cocoons and handfuls of raw wool, linen, and cotton fibers, alongside squares of material woven from each, with an invitation to “please touch.” \nLeft: “Floral Appliqué Quilt” (1856), cotton; right: Attributed to a Member of the Sinclair Family, “Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden Quilt” (mid-19th century), cotton\nFrom here, the show shifts to a standout section that exudes the layered lushness of a flourishing botanical garden. With an abundance of vivid vining blossoms, “Pot of Flowers Quilt with Birds” (c. 1860) radiates a feeling of unbridled joy and abundance. Its neighbor, “Flower Quilt” (c. 1955–63), an album-style quilt stitched by American sociologist Raymond F. Bellamy, reflects his interest in botany, carefully cataloguing a different type of flower in each square. Highlighting the symbolic language of plants, a green and white mourning quilt from the mid-1800s (“Members of the Freewill Baptist Church Presentation Quilt for William A. Sargent”) memorializes members of a church community with handwritten messages in ink, along with appliquéd weeping willows to represent sadness.\nIn the final gallery, a grouping of geometric quilts stitched from salvaged scraps speak to a history of thrift and resourcefulness in quilt making. Among these works are the dynamic, polyester and cotton “Pinwheel Variation Quilt” (1960) by Gee’s Bend quilter Malissia Pettway and artist Tomie Nagano’s “Ajiro-Monyo” (1995), made from vintage kimonos and drawing inspiration from boro textiles and woven basketry.\n\nIndigo dyeing: Cheepa family dyers, Kala Dera, Rajasthan, India, film still\nAlthough the exhibition’s subtitle, The Natural History of American Textiles, has the air of a college course and seems to promise a definitive deep dive, it’s actually more of an introductory sampler. A smattering of interesting tidbits on a wide range of topics (e.g., global trade, slave labor, the invention of the cotton gin, 19th-century herbaria, flower symbolism) pepper the wall texts. Many of these factoids could be the seeds for spinoff shows — and, taken together, could veer the curation into a muddled mess. But, like the “Philadelphia Pavement Quilt” (c. 1930) — which looks like a tidy grid of tiny, precise squares up close, but reveals its dazzling composition anew from a distance — the exhibition comes into focus on different levels. A slow, close viewing, spent absorbing each label and examining the corresponding details of the quilts, illustrations, and swatches, uncovers a web of connections between materials and methods, technology and trade, plants and people — and, ultimately, the hive of activity wrapped up in each quilt’s physical history. The gorgeous, well-considered selection of quilts also coheres on a purely visual level, as flowers, leaf motifs, and fabric scraps pinwheel across the surfaces.\nThe eclectic threads of An Ecology of Quilts merge to tell a story that starts outdoors, with seeds sprouting, blooming, and reaching toward the sun. Whether driven by a desire to document the beauty of flowers, turn castoff fabric fragments into cozy bedcovers, or harness the colors hidden inside plants, the show invites viewers to see the myriad ways that human ingenuity has interlaced with natural forces to shape quilting as an expressive American art form.\n\nInstallation view of An Ecology of Quilts: The Natural History of American Textiles at the American Folk Art Museum \n“Philadelphia Pavement Quilt” (c. 1930), cotton\n“Philadelphia Pavement Quilt,” detail \nNicolas Regnault, from La botanique mise à la porteé de tout le monde; ou, Collection des plantes d’usage dans la médecine, dans les alimens et dans les arts (1774), hand-colored engravings\nLabel illustration: “The Nopal plant that is grown in America and produces seed,” from Reports on the History, Organization, and Status of Various Catholic Dioceses of New Spain and Peru (1620–49), watercolor on paper\nInstallation view of An Ecology of Quilts: The Natural History of American Textiles at the American Folk Art Museum \n“Log Cabin Variation Quilt,” detail (c. 1900), cotton, linen, wool, and synthetic fabrics\nAn Ecology of Quilts: The Natural History of American Textiles continues at the American Folk Art Museum (2 Lincoln Square, Lincoln Square, Upper West Side, Manhattan) through March 1, 2026.

    "body": "\n\tSeveral hours after news broke that thieves had broken into the Louvre Museum in Paris and stolen royal jewels of “incalculable” value, France’s Ministry of Culture sent out a press release officially detailing what was stolen in the robbery.\n\n\tBy the culture ministry’s accounting, the pieces stolen from the Galerie d’Apollon included: \n\n\t(Follow the links to see the Louvre’s images + historical information of the pieces):\n\n\nDiadem from the parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense;\nNecklace from the sapphire parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense;\nEarring from the same sapphire parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense;\nEmerald necklace from the parure of Empress Marie-Louise;\nPair of emerald earrings from the parure of Empress Marie-Louise;\n“Reliquary” brooch;\nDiadem of Empress Eugénie;\nLarge corsage bow of Empress Eugénie (brooch).\n\n\n\n\tAccording to the release, the thieves dropped two of those items—the “reliquary” brooch and the corsage bow—while making their escape. \n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tBoth objects were “recovered in good condition.”\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe emerald necklace and earrings from the parure of Empress Marie-Louise, stolen from the Louvre on Sunday. The necklace includes 32 emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHere’s the press release in full, translated from the French:\t\n\n\tInformation regarding the burglary that occurred on Sunday, October 19, at the Louvre Museum\n\n\tThis Sunday, October 19, the Louvre Museum experienced a break-in and theft in the Galerie d’Apollon, which houses the royal collection of gems and the French Crown Jewels. Two high-security display cases were targeted, and several items of inestimable heritage value were stolen, including:\n\n\nDiadem from the parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense;\nNecklace from the sapphire parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense;\nEarring from the same sapphire parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense;\nEmerald necklace from the parure of Empress Marie-Louise;\nPair of emerald earrings from the parure of Empress Marie-Louise;\n“Reliquary” brooch;\nDiadem of Empress Eugénie;\nLarge corsage bow of Empress Eugénie (brooch).\n\n\n\n\tThe alarms located on the exterior window of the Galerie d’Apollon and those connected to the two display cases were triggered. At the time of the break-in—particularly fast and violent—the five Louvre security agents present in the room and in nearby galleries immediately followed the established security protocol: making contact with law enforcement and prioritizing the safety of visitors and staff.\n\n\tThanks to the professionalism and swift intervention of the Louvre’s agents, the thieves fled the scene, leaving behind two of the items they had attempted to steal—specifically, Empress Eugénie’s corsage bow and the reliquary brooch, both of which were recovered in good condition. A mechanical cherry picker used by the perpetrators was seized thanks to the prompt response of a Louvre museum security officer, while the burglar escaped on foot.\n\n\tNo injuries were reported among the public or staff.\n\n\n\tThe Minister of Culture wishes to thank the Louvre’s staff for their responsiveness and great professionalism.\n\n\tShe also recalls that, as part of the “Louvre – New Renaissance” project announced by the President of the Republic last January, an ambitious new security plan is being implemented, including:\n\n\nEnhanced security measures with new-generation surveillance cameras;\nPerimeter detection;\nA new security command center.\n\n\n\n\tAn investigation for organized theft and conspiracy to commit a crime has been opened and entrusted to the Brigade de répression du banditisme (BRB) under the authority of the Paris public prosecutor’s office.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n",

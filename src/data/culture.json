    "body": "\n\tin Music, Television |   \tOctober 10th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nBri­an Eno once said of the Vel­vet Under­ground that their first album sold only 30,000 copies, but every­one who bought one start­ed a band. Joy Divi­sion’s debut Unknown Plea­sures sold only 20,000 copies in its ini­tial peri­od of release, but the T‑shirt embla­zoned with its cov­er art — an image of radio waves ema­nat­ing from a pul­sar tak­en from an astron­o­my ency­clo­pe­dia — has long since con­sti­tut­ed a com­mer­cial-semi­otic empire unto itself. That speaks to the vast sub­cul­tur­al influ­ence of the band, despite their only hav­ing been active from 1976 to 1980. When we speak of the genre of post-punk, we speak, in large part, of Joy Divi­sion and the artists they influ­enced.\nLess than a year after the 1979 release of Unknown Plea­sures, Joy Divi­sion’s lead singer Ian Cur­tis com­mit­ted sui­cide. The band had already record­ed Clos­er, their sec­ond and last album (at least before the sub­se­quent, more suc­cess­ful ref­or­ma­tion as New Order). Scant though it may be, their stu­dio discog­ra­phy has only drawn more and more crit­i­cal acclaim over the decades.\nStill, fans who weren’t around to wit­ness the rise of Joy Divi­sion first-hand will sus­pect they’ve missed out on some­thing essen­tial. “Live, Joy Divi­sion were heavy,” remem­bers band his­to­ri­an Jon Sav­age. “Per­form­ers — and David Bowie is a good exam­ple – know exact­ly what to give and what to with­hold, but Ian Cur­tis didn’t have that stage­craft. He just came on and gave every­thing.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThat sort of inten­si­ty, Sav­age adds, is “not infi­nite­ly repro­ducible”; even at the time, it seems that those who wit­nessed Joy Divi­sion in con­cert under­stood that their pecu­liar­ly com­pelling ener­gy was dri­ving toward some kind of final com­bus­tion. You can get a taste of it in the col­lec­tion of the group’s every tele­vised per­for­mance, orig­i­nal­ly aired on BBC2 and Grana­da TV in 1978 and 1979, at the top of the post; just above, we have a 70-minute com­pi­la­tion of all their filmed live shows. Much of it con­sists of footage shot over two nights at the Apol­lo The­atre in 1979, which the uploader describes as of poor qual­i­ty — but “accord­ing to peo­ple who were there, the gig’s qual­i­ty was poor in per­son too.” As much as gen­er­a­tions of fans have done to mythol­o­gize the band’s brief exis­tence over the past 45 years, here is evi­dence that even Joy Divi­sion had an off night once in a while.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n75 Post-Punk and Hard­core Con­certs from the 1980s Have Been Dig­i­tized & Put Online: Fugazi, GWAR, Lemon­heads, Dain Bra­m­age (with Dave Grohl) & More\nThe His­to­ry of Rock n Roll in 10 Songs: A List Cre­at­ed by Leg­endary Rock Crit­ic Greil Mar­cus\nRadio­head Cov­ers The Smiths & New Order (2007)\nHear the 50 Best Post-Punk Albums of All Time: A Nos­tal­gia-Induc­ing Playlist Curat­ed by Paste Mag­a­zine\nHear a 9‑Hour Trib­ute to John Peel: A Col­lec­tion of His Best “Peel Ses­sions”\nAn Ani­mat­ed His­to­ry of Goth\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Since 2020, Pure Street Photography—an initiative focused on connecting international photographers—has commended visual storytellers through an annual competition.\nThis year’s edition drew an impressive 1,160 submissions across 34 countries and five continents. Judged by British writer and curator David Campany alongside founder Dimpy Bhalotia, a total of 147 winning and finalist images were chosen. \nChris Yan, “Mirror”\nFrom capturing unfortunately humorous moments before disaster to documenting endearing instances of whimsy, the wide range of winning images evoke a spectrum of expressions. Together, they mirror the distinct emotions one might feel while walking down the street, embodying the authentic spirit of the medium.\nIn a large-scale exhibition at Mumbai’s Jehangir Art Gallery, each winning image will be on view in January 2026.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the famous first stanza of the 17th-century poem “Auguries of Innocence,” William Blake writes:\n\nTo see a world in a grain of sandAnd a heaven in a wild flower,Hold infinity in the palm of your handAnd eternity in an hour.\n\nPerhaps Blake didn’t intend us to literally hold infinity in our hands, but he may have been aware that there was, in a manner of speaking, a way to don the entire known universe.\nPhoto by Ulf Bruxe, Historical Museum/SHM\nCombining the elegance of gold jewelry with the meticulous craftsmanship of intricate timepieces, a unique style of ring emerged from a fashion for the cosmos during the 16th and 17th centuries. Known as armillary rings, these deceptively simple gold creations can be worn on the finger like any other band, but when removed, they open up into a sphere made of several interconnecting circular bands operated by delicate hinges.\nExamples of armillary rings in the British Museum and the Swedish National Museums of History have been traced to Germany, made during the Late Renaissance as the study of astronomy reached new heights. In 1543, Copernicus essentially launched the scientific revolution when he claimed that the Earth rotates around the Sun, not the other way around.\nA few years later, Italian polymath Galileo Galilei, known as a pioneer of observational astronomy, built a telescope powerful enough to, for the first time, observe the stars of the Milky Way, see Jupiter’s four largest satellites, and make out Saturn’s rings, among other discoveries.\nThe historic gold rings are based on ancient astronomical instruments called armillary spheres, which emerged from the long-disproven theory that everything in the cosmos revolved around Earth. The designs, which were used since at least the 2nd century, place our planet at the center. A group of rings rotates on an axis, providing reference points for locating other celestial bodies. Separate bands correlate to the equator, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and the revolution of the Sun—a ring which also represents the constellations of the Zodiac.\nPhoto by Nina Davis, Historical Museum/SHM\nPhoto by Helena Bonnevier, Historical Museum/SHM\nImage © The Trustees of the British Museum\nImage © The Trustees of the British Museum\nPhoto by Helena Bonnevier, Historical Museum/SHM\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“Street photography is a way of life,” Jamel Shabazz says, a sentiment he’s embodied and shared with the public for the past half century. The legendary photographer is best known for documenting the style, culture, and political landscape of his native Brooklyn from the 1980s onward, part of which is now collected in a new book published by Prestel.\nProspect Park: Photographs of a Brooklyn Oasis, 1980 to 2025 contains 120 color and black-and-white images captured within the urban enclave. At 585 acres, the public park offers a vast area for gathering, exercising, and engaging with nature, and for Shabazz, it’s always been a refuge from life’s realities.\nProspect Park, 1995, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nHe began taking the photos in this collection after returning to New York following a 36-month service in the U.S. Army and while he worked for the Department of Corrections at the notorious Riker’s Island facility. For Shabazz, Prospect Park became a site of joy and community and a small escape from these everyday horrors.\nIncluded in the monograph are several portraits that show what a fixture the photographer has been in the park. Warm, easy smiles and confident poses abound, and while the popular fashions and technology may change, so much of life depicted stays the same. The images glimpse how vital the outdoor space has remained over the years, as several generations climb trees, gather to look out over one of the lakes, or simply find joy in each other’s company.\nFind more of Shabazz’s archive on Instagram, and pick up a copy of Prospect Park on Bookshop.\nProspect Park, 1981, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nJamel Shabazz’s father at Prospect Park, 1990, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2010, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2014, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 1982, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2012, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nProspect Park, 2012, © Jamel Shabazz, 2025\nJamel Shabazz, © Michael McCoy, 2016\nImage © Prestel / Jamel Shabazz, 2025\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn a world this absurd and disastrous, do we gravitate toward cynicism or levity? For the artist duo known as Murmure (previously), both are the only option.\nThe Caen, France-based pair presents a new body of paintings and charcoal drawings in their plainly titled exhibition, La fête est finie, or The party is over. Through a unique sense of wit and irony, they transform astronauts into runway models, the moon into a nuclear power plant, and a birthday cake into a raging forest fire. \n“Moon Walk” (2025), carbon pencil on paper, 50 x 40 centimeters\nWhere there could be commonplace sights or moments of joy and frivolity, Murmure instead presents an unsettling composition. Every ill-advised choice—whether baking in front of a UV screen or watching cows graze on an ice floe—becomes a spectacular confrontation with our collective obsessions with consumerism, ecological wreckage, and self-serving gluttony.\nLa fête est finie is on view through November 22 at Galerie LJ in Paris.

From fast food to houseplants to a vibrant bar cart, his compositions playfully explore themes of indulgence, impermanence, beauty, and the quotidian.\n“Greasy Spoon”\nUntil recently, Hamlyn has focused predominantly on cartoonish botanicals, and he now delves further into the still-life genre. Works like “Greasy Spoon,” “Shelf Life,” and “Drive-Thru” incorporate motifs of food and trendy home decor evocative of quirky snapshots one might see on Instagram, with people just out of frame.\nThe works seen here were recently presented by Moosey, and you can find more of Hamlyn’s work on his website and Instagram.\n“Potwash (I Ought to Give You a Lesson in How to Clean Tables, Boy!”\n“Drive-Thru”\n“Berry and Rye”\n“Shelf Life”\n“Soft Vanitas”\n“Megadeal”\n“Houseplant”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Ranging from colorful illustrations that meticulously catalogue differences in categories of food, transit, and appliances, to found object sculptures that form relics of a world understood through touch, the show invites visitors to look, listen, smell, and touch to connect with a diversity of ways of “looking” at the world.\nLOOK HERE features six artists with studio practices based out of CCW – Kelly Brown, Cindy Gosselin, Clyde Henry, Tim Quinn, Brandon Spicer-Crawley, and Allen Yu. Curated by Jennifer Gilbert alongside two CCW artists  — Mary T. Bevlock and Paige Donovan — the exhibition emphasizes art’s ability to communicate across different sensory channels.\nThe show’s design integrates many elements to enhance accessibility for a variety of audiences, including braille, videos about the artists with American Sign Language (ASL) embedded, touch panels featuring artists’ materials, sensory backpacks, an Easy Read guide, a quiet room, and tours led by neurodivergent artists.\nLOOK HERE is complemented by a series of related events, including two satellite exhibitions – one at Haverford’s VCAM gallery, LOOK THERE, featuring a single work from a larger group of 99 CCW artists, and another at Philadelphia’s Atelier Gallery through October, LOOK EVERYWHERE, which highlights works from 33 artists from 30 progressive art studios around the United States. \nThese exhibitions will coincide with the sixth annual Creating Community Symposium, happening October 20–23. Originally founded by California’s Creative Growth Art Center, the symposium brings together professionals from progressive art studios around the US to discuss best practices, advocacy, and the evolving intersection of art and disability. This is the first time the gathering will be held on the East Coast.\nLOOK HERE and LOOK THERE are open through December 13, 2025. LOOK EVERYWHERE closes on October 31.\nTo learn more, visit hav.to/lookhere.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

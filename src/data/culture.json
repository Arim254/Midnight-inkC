    "body": "\n\n\t\nBy marrying the realistic with the fantastical and uncanny, Stephanie Temma Hier conjures tension: there’s a calf-hair necktie that morphs into a table fan, popcorn surrounding pink ballet shoes, and a rapt snake framed by orange igneous rocks.\nThe Brooklyn-based artist is formally trained as a painter and self-taught as a ceramicist, and she fuses the two modes of working into a complementary practice. Hier begins by sculpting a wide range of forms, and after several rounds of firing with both handmade and commercially available glazes, she adds a painting. The pairings arise intuitively, sometimes through free association, trial and error, or by homing in on a color.\n\nEarlier works include a decadent, three-tiered cake piped not with pillowy buttercream but instead trimmed with olives, sausages, and thin slices of prosciutto. There’s also a thick head of green cabbage that reveals a trio of ravenous chicks roosted in its core. While the artist’s depictions in both clay and paint are lifelike, the juxtapositions push the works firmly into the realm of the surreal and ambiguous.\nMany of the works shown here will debut this month at Anton Kern Gallery for Hier’s solo exhibition, Swan Song. Nodding to the ancient Greek belief that the otherwise “mute” birds sing just before their deaths, the exhibition takes transformation as its starting point. Elements of Dutch still lifes appear, too, as flowers bloom and pastries and coffee are consumed across a picnic-esque surface.\nHier created the Swan Song pieces simultaneously, allowing motifs and themes to recur throughout. The titular bird, for example, appears in several works, from the feathered chair with thick, stocky webbed legs to the intimate portrait encircled by an array of speckled shoes. Together, the mixed-media pieces create a sort of domestic tableau that unsettles in its familiarity, presenting a fantastic world in which the only inevitabilities are the unexpected and change.\nSwan Song is on view from January 14 to February 21 in New York. Find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 1666, the marriage of Emperor Leopold I and Infanta Margarita Teresa of Spain solidified a political alliance between the Austrian and Spanish sides of the Habsburg family. They were also both uncle and niece and first cousins, such was the intense insularity of royal marriages intended to gain or maintain power across Europe.\nThe union was arranged while Margarita Teresa was very young—she was only around 15 when they married—and during the years leading up to the wedding, court painter Diego Velázquez created numerous portraits of her, which were sent to Leopold I in the form of tokens or updates documenting the imperial bride’s development into a young woman. \n“Them, after Hodges, Kruseman, Batoni and Skirving” (2022-25), oil on linen in four individually framed ovals, dimensions variable: medium 7.5 x 9.5 centimeters; large 9 x 11.9 centimeters\nFor Derrick Guild, portraits of the likes of the Infanta and the Spanish royal family, such as Velázquez’s seminal “Las Meninas,” provide the starting point for a painting practice that examines social status, mores, and expectations. Through 17th- and 18th-century portraits, Guild examines art as a vehicle for social and diplomatic relations, considering how painting was used to impart very specific messages and emphasize prestige.\nHis “Label Infanta Margarita, after Velazquez and del Mazo,” for example, reproduces a portrait of the Spanish princess across a gridded composition of paper luggage tags, nodding to the harsh reality that the young woman’s sole role in life was to essentially be shipped off to marry well and produce heirs.\nMargarita Teresa had four children (and two miscarriages) during her six-year marriage to Leopold I. She died at the age of 22, and only one of her children lived to adulthood. The grid-like composition, set against a black background, also invokes a cage behind which the young woman is confined.\nTags are a recurring motif in Guild’s paintings, which combine trompe l’oeil details of paper and ribbon with intimate details of art historical pieces. In addition to the reference to shipping, they’re also evocative of labels used to identify and organize objects into place.\n“Label Infanta Maria Theresa, after workshop of Velázquez” (2025), oil on linen, 65 x 85 centimeters\nGuild is interested in the distortions and layered meanings of historic portraiture. Along with large-scale paintings, the artist also creates tender assemblies of smaller works in oval, gold frames, sometimes connected by gold-plated chains. Eyes are often encapsulated in their own frames, and it’s hard to escape the feeling of being watched.\nThese tiny, fragmented pieces also hone in on elegant hands, sensuous lips, jewelery, and fabrics, nodding to the tradition of painted miniatures. Often elaborately detailed for their size, these tiny portraits served as diplomatic gifts, keepsakes, tokens of love, and ways to commemorate people or events. They were a key element of introducing eligible men and women to prospective wives and husbands, and in aristocratic circles, social climbing was a not-so-hidden goal. Before photography, in the courtship scene, they were a kind of profile picture.\nIf you enjoy this work, you may also like Robyn Rich’s miniature eye pieces derived from Georgian portraits or the eccentric paintings of Volker Hermes, alongside whom Guild recently exhibited at James Freeman Gallery.

    "body": "\n            South Africa has scrapped a performance mourning victims of Israel's genocide in Gaza that was selected for the country's 2026 Venice Biennale pavilion. In a statement to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for the nation's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture said the pavilion “should not be used to amplify similarly divisive global disputes that do not center South Africa’s own story,” adding: “We need to use our platforms to sell our country to the world.”Artist Gabrielle Goliath and curator Ingrid Masondo's proposal for the South African presentation, titled Elegy after Goliath's decade-long vocal performance series, had been chosen for the Biennale by an independent committee in December. According to reporting by the South African publication Daily Maverick, the decision to reject the artwork originated from the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture's minister, Gayton McKenzie, the founder of the right-wing Patriotic Alliance party. Goliath's pavilion performance would have addressed the \"unfolding crisis of displacement and death in Gaza,\" according to a representative of her studio, reached via email by Hyperallergic. The performance was also expected to address the Israeli military's killing of the Palestinian poet Hiba Abu Nada, the femicide in South Africa, and the Herero and Nama genocide perpetuated by Germans in Namibia in the early 20th century. However, according to the Daily Maverick, McKenzie took issue with the proposal's content regarding Israel and Gaza, writing in an internal letter in December that the subject was \"highly divisive in nature and relates to an ongoing international conflict that is widely polarising.” He then reportedly threatened to withdraw South Africa from the international art event if the work was not removed, a move decried by the country's pavilion selection committee as unconstitutional. In a January 8 open letter, the members of the appointed Biennale selection committee defended their decision to accept Elegy.\"We affirm our continued and unequivocal support for the artist, the curator, and their project in the face of political pressure and attempts to silence free expression and compromise artistic integrity,\" reads the statement, signed by Greer Valley, Molemo Moiloa, Nomusa Makhubu, Sean O’Toole, and Tumelo Mosaka.“We further reject all forms of censorship and intimidation that seek to curtail critical artistic practice or undermine the autonomy of cultural production,” the letter continues. The group characterized Elegy as concerning “intimacy, care, and listening, [and] creating space for reflection on loss and remembrance.\"Organizers of the country's pavilion were reportedly notified of McKenzie's request to remove the performance series on January 2. The South African government had appointed the organization Art Periodic to lead the fundraising and production of the pavilion; however, the nonprofit said in a statement that it no longer \"holds a mandate to proceed with the project.\" Art Periodic had appointed the selection committee that chose Elegy.South Africa Friends of Israel posted a video on Facebook that apparently shows McKenzie rejecting that a genocide was unfolding in Gaza, a claim that contradicts the official characterization of the United Nations and several human rights groups. He also vowed to \"stop the ICJ case,\" likely referring to South Africa's genocide charge against Israel in the United Nations' International Court of Justice, if he were to become president. (Hyperallergic has not independently verified the video clip.)In an email statement sent to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture rejected the allegations of censorship and stated that McKenzie wished for the pavilion not to become a “proxy arena for geopolitical conflicts.\"\"His concern relates solely to the fact that South Africa is currently the subject of highly contested and politically charged narratives internationally, including being falsely labelled a 'genocidal state,'\" the spokesperson said, possibly referring to comparisons between Israel and Apartheid-era South Africa.The spokesperson also claimed that a \"foreign country was funding or partly funding this exhibition,\" but did not immediately clarify which nation they were referring to. Goliath and Masondo have appealed the decision to the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation, the artist's studio told Hyperallergic in an email.According to the Maverick, communications from McKenzie suggested he would favor works for the pavilion that portray South Africa more positively. The United States Department of State issued a similar nationalistic requirement for its pavilion proposal guidelines last year. “I have said it many times: my work is not about violence, but rather foregrounds practices of mourning, survival, and repair, within and despite this normative disregard,\" Goliath told the Maverick. \"At a moment in which sustaining hope is a political imperative, I think it is all the more crucial to emphasise my work as life-work rather than death-work, and as rooted in a decolonial black feminist project of care and radical love.”The spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture said the nation will still participate in the upcoming Venice Biennale, but that the department had retained control of “administration and curation.”Hyperallergic has contacted Art Periodic and the Venice Biennale for comment. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        South Africa\n                      \n                      \n                        Venice Biennale\n                      \n                  \n        ",

Carin Leong (video and images courtesy Field of Vision)\n        Sandcastles, a new short from documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist Carin Leong, is now available to watch on Field of Vision. Singapore, Michigan, was a thriving lumber town in the late 1800s, until erosion from mass deforestation caused the surrounding sand dunes to shift and swallow it whole. Yet just as quickly as the town disappeared under sand, its namesake in the East emerged from it: Around the world, Singapore is renowned for its use of land reclamation — importing sand to increase landmass and spur urban development.From the perspective of multiple characters, including sand importers, land developers, environmental activists, governments fighting climate change, and the Indigenous communities of both Singapores, the film’s mirroring of the two locations begs the question: “How can we trust the very ground we walk on when it’s built with and destroyed by nothing more than sand?”These manmade edifices illustrate the transient nature of humankind’s existence, captured poignantly through the poetry of sandcastles — constructed as the foundations of civilization, yet easily blown away by the wind.Still from Sandcastles (2024), dir.

The group is perhaps best known for hosting the World Summit on Arts and Culture, whose 10th edition last year gathered artists and industry leaders to discuss topics including artificial intelligence, Indigenous knowledge, and fair working conditions.Members of IFACCA include representatives for more than 70 countries, including the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the US arts funding agency that Trump has sought to dismantle. As of today, the NEA is still listed as a member on IFACCA's website. Hyperallergic has contacted IFACCA's executive director, Magdalena Moreno Mujica, as well as the NEA for comment. Established in 1959 in response to mass cultural heritage loss during World War II, the ICCROM focuses on disaster risk management and conservation of historic sites, monuments, museum collections, and other forms of artistic patrimony. Its work includes training experts, leading research, and encouraging international bodies to cooperate on preservation. In September 2024, ICCROM partnered with the US State Department to help safeguard Ukrainian cultural sites under threat from Russian attacks. In a statement shared with Hyperallergic, ICCROM said the US had been a member since 1971 and that its withdrawal “will have a direct impact on ICCROM’s core capacities, with consequences for the Organization’s ability to deliver on its mandate.”Hermann Parzinger, executive president of the pan-European cultural heritage group Europa Nostra, also decried the move, particularly in light of Trump's “deplorable withdrawal” from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) last July.“This sweeping retreat from multilateral cooperation of a major global player seems to signal a troubling misunderstanding of the essential role that culture and heritage play in fostering peace, mutual respect, resilience, innovation, and shared prosperity across the globe,” Parzinger said.Around half of the entities in the White House memo are connected to the United Nations, and several address clean energy and the environment, including the high-profile UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the basis of international efforts to address global warming. But the list also includes a multilateral counterterrorism body, a UN office dedicated to preventing violence against children, and a coalition working to protect internet freedom, suggesting a broad criteria and unclear priorities.Advocates and officials warned that Trump's mass exodus from these efforts could have disastrous consequences for human rights worldwide. The president's distancing from global cooperation on urgent issues such as the climate emergency comes just a week after the US attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, and in the wake of Trump's renewed threats to seize Greenland from Denmark.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Her eyes look up in his direction and so ours follow. While she is center stage, he is the one who claims our gaze. And speaking of claiming, Gilot wears a leafy crown in Doisneau’s photo, like many a muse in art before her, and hanging from a close-fitting black band around her neck is a large pendant of a bull’s head, the animal that frequently, even obsessively, appears in Picasso’s work throughout his lifetime. It’s all an old story, dressed up for their time, and now ours.Has any 20th-century artist been written about more than Picasso? Considering John Richardson’s exhaustive four-volume biography, and countless other books, articles, reviews, movies, exhibition catalogs, and whatever else, likely not. And yet, as Roe notes at the outset of her introduction, “Hidden Portraits is the first book in English to tell the story of all six significant women in Picasso’s life.” Those women were, by the way: Fernande Olivier, Olga Khokhlova, Marie-Thérèse Walter, Dora Maar, Françoise Gilot, and Jacqueline Roque. Cover of Sue Roe's Hidden Portraits: Six Women Who Shaped Picasso's Life (image courtesy W. W. Norton & Company)As the “first book in English” to recount their lives (according to the author), Roe’s is a more-than-welcome addition to Picasso-land, though with the caveat that two of those women, Olivier and Gilot, wrote their own stories, which have been translated into English. It’s worth noting that Olivier’s was suppressed by Picasso during her lifetime, and after Gilot succeeded in publishing hers, Picasso refused to see their two children for the rest of his life. But none of this should come as a surprise. Picasso’s cruelty has long been subjected to examination and approbation. See Claire Dederer’s 2023 book Monsters: A Fan’s Dilemma, or the 1996 Merchant Ivory film Surviving Picasso, among many other examples.Roe’s narrative is a very different beast. Extensively researched, she provides vivid accounts of each woman from their childhoods (some of which is previously unknown or little known) through the ends of their lives (often upsetting — Walter and Roque both died by suicide). In this way, Hidden Portraits is a rich, often cinematic examination of significant 20th-century lives. Roe seeks to rescue her subjects from being cast as victims and she explores the agency and victories they experienced as women who, we are repeatedly reminded, ardently loved Picasso. It’s complicated, but somehow not quite complicated enough.“Of course, all six women sat, at least occasionally, for Picasso,” Roe writes, clarifying  that, “What we may for convenience call his portraits are primarily expressions of his encounters with paint.” Similarly, the author’s own portraits of her subjects are not entirely about them either. They are, ultimately, about Picasso himself: the love-bombing creature of conquest and control. He locked Olivier, his first great passion (and the only woman his same age; the others were between 10 and 46 years younger than him), in their apartment when he went out, “so anxious was he to keep her to himself,” and years later, when Gilot left him (the only woman ever to do so), he allowed, or instructed, that all her things be thrown out — not just her clothing and casual possessions, but her own artwork, art he’d given her, and cherished letters from Matisse. Roe treats all of it with a dispassionate detachment that is somewhat discomforting.Olga Khokhlova in Afternoon of a Faun (c. 1916) (image via Wikipedia)Separate the man from the art, sure. At this point in human history, what choice do we have? But what about the work of the book’s six subjects? Gilot and Maar were artists themselves, Khokhlova a dancer with the esteemed Ballet Russes, and Fernande a writer. What about their own disrupted, even suppressed, work? Roe’s reserve around her subjects’ struggles can feel disheartening. She ends her book with an appeal that we understand her position as a biographer who can only offer the facts. While she has done a remarkable job of uncovering and expressing them, just facts aren’t really how biography works. The genre is narrative, a story traced through the overwhelming details of a given life, or lives. Roe’s writing about those details is admirable and often incredibly interesting, but too much is left unsaid.Hidden Portraits: Six Women Who Shaped Picasso's Life by Sue Roe (2025) is published by W.

She constructed “Early Earth,” the setting of two of her graphic novels, The Encyclopedia of Early Earth (2013) and The One Hundred Nights of Hero (2016). The former is a collection of creation myths for Early Earth, while the other is modeled on One Thousand and One Nights and its frame story of a woman delaying a man’s predation by distracting him with storytelling. The latter book has been adapted into a feature film, 100 Nights of Hero, which faithfully translates the book’s feminist commentary while disappointingly deemphasizing its more complex narrative techniques.Greenberg sets her book in a region of Early Earth characterized by stifling gender-based oppression, a country where women are forbidden to read or write and can be executed on the whims of their husbands. Young noblewoman Cherry (played in the film by Maika Monroe) learns that her husband has wagered with his friend Manfred (Nicholas Galitzine) that she can resist the latter’s seduction for 100 nights. To rebuff Manfred, who makes it clear that he won’t take “no” for an answer, Cherry’s maid and secret lover, Hero (Emma Corrin), employs the Scheherazade gambit, occupying him with stories each evening until he falls asleep. Nicholas Galitzine and Maika Monroe in Julia Jackman’s 100 Nights of Hero (courtesy Matthew Towers, an Independent Film Company Release)As the book relates a variety of these stories, mixing folklore and myth, their connections to Hero’s past eventually become clear. The film has just one story within the larger one, a tale of three sisters (distractingly, one is played by Charli xcx) who cause a scandal when their literacy is revealed. Instead of an interwoven anthology, the movie cuts back and forth between the two threads. That simplification, likely employed to streamline the production, weakens Greenberg’s overarching investigation into how storytelling and coded meanings can subvert oppression. It is also just odd that the characters continually attest to how vital it is that women tell each other their own stories when none of those stories are actually accessible to the audience. Felicity Jones, Emma Corrin, and Maika Monroe in Julia Jackman’s 100 Nights of Hero (courtesy Jed Knight, an Independent Film Company Release)However, while her script lacks the book’s mythic bent, director and co-screenwriter (with Greenberg) Julia Jackman does evoke that quality in the film’s visual sensibility. Recalling films like Tarsem Singh’s 2006 adventure fantasy The Fall or the works of Wes Anderson, she incorporates the tropes of an illustrated storybook into the aesthetic, through the sumptuous set and costume design and by coaxing heightened, mannered performances from her actors. This is a film of rich and contrasting colors — Cherry’s white clothing pointedly emphasizing how she remains undefiled by the male touch, Manfred’s sinister all-black attire, the three sisters in idyllic greens and blues. In some respects, the movie seems crafted specifically to be released as clips on social media sites — for better or worse, our contemporary mode of sharing folktales. It is most striking in moments that lend themselves to clips, like a jarringly violent scene of Manfred proudly holding up the carcass of a deer he’s slaughtered. Shots often put characters or actions dead center in the screen, accommodating the cropping needed to make widescreen imagery legible in portrait mode on social feeds. It remains to be seen whether the film will catch on like the stories within it in Early Earth. But I’d suggest starting by sharing the graphic novel.100 Nights of Hero is now streaming.\n                  \n                      \n                        Film Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        100 Nights of Hero\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

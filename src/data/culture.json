If you were a turkey, you had it rel­a­tive­ly easy. But the ducks? Not so much. On the menu, you’ll find Mal­lard duck and Rud­dy duck. But also Red-head duck, Long Island duck­ling, Teal duck and Can­vas-back duck, too. A duck in NYC was not a good place to be.\nAnd, oh, those prices!  Not one item above a few dol­lars. But let’s account for infla­tion, shall we? In 2021, one Red­di­tor not­ed: “I found a cal­cu­la­tor and it turns out that $.30 in 1899 equals $10.00 now. The Fried oys­ter crabs would be $24.99 now and a Philadel­phia chick­en would be $66.65. So, the cheap­est thing on the menu is Sweet but­ter­milk for $.10, but today would be $3.33.”\nFor our U.S. read­ers, enjoy your hol­i­day tomor­row…\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nA Relax­ing, ASMR Re-Cre­ation of Peo­ple Cook­ing Thanks­giv­ing Din­ner in the 1820s\nMar­i­lyn Monroe’s Hand­writ­ten Turkey-and-Stuff­ing Recipe\nRead 900+ Thanks­giv­ing Books Free at the Inter­net Archive\nF.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tNovember 27th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAlice’s Restau­rant. It’s now a Thanks­giv­ing clas­sic, and some­thing of a tra­di­tion around here. Record­ed in 1967, the 18+ minute coun­ter­cul­ture song recounts Arlo Guthrie’s real encounter with the law, start­ing on Thanks­giv­ing Day 1965. As the long song unfolds, we hear all about how a hip­pie-bat­ing police offi­cer, by the name of William “Obie” Oban­hein, arrest­ed Arlo for lit­ter­ing. (Cul­tur­al foot­note: Obie pre­vi­ous­ly posed for sev­er­al Nor­man Rock­well paint­ings, includ­ing the well-known paint­ing, “The Run­away,” that graced a 1958 cov­er of The Sat­ur­day Evening Post.) In fair­ly short order, Arlo pleads guilty to a mis­de­meanor charge, pays a $25 fine, and cleans up the thrash. But the sto­ry isn’t over. Not by a long shot.\nLat­er, when Arlo (son of Woody Guthrie) gets called up for the draft, the pet­ty crime iron­i­cal­ly becomes a basis for dis­qual­i­fy­ing him from mil­i­tary ser­vice in the Viet­nam War. Guthrie recounts this with some bit­ter­ness as the song builds into a satir­i­cal protest against the war: “I’m sit­tin’ here on the Group W bench ’cause you want to know if I’m moral enough to join the Army, burn women, kids, hous­es and vil­lages after bein’ a lit­ter­bug.” And then we’re back to the cheery cho­rus again: “You can get any­thing you want, at Alice’s Restau­rant.”\nWe have fea­tured Guthrie’s clas­sic dur­ing past years.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tNovember 26th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nPrac­ti­cal­ly any­one could take one glance at Les Demoi­selles d’Av­i­gnon and iden­ti­fy it as a Picas­so, even if they’ve nev­er seen it before and could­n’t say any­thing else about it. That alone goes some way to explain­ing why the paint­ing would end up ranked as the most impor­tant art­work of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, at least accord­ing to a study by Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go econ­o­mist David W. Galen­son. For that title it beat out the likes of Robert Smith­son’s Spi­ral Jet­ty, Richard Hamil­ton’s Just what is it that makes today’s homes so dif­fer­ent, so appeal­ing?, Mar­cel Ducham­p’s Foun­tain and Nude Descend­ing a Stair­case, No. 2, and Picas­so’s own Guer­ni­ca.\nWith Les Demoi­selles d’Av­i­gnon, Galen­son writes, “the great­est artist of the cen­tu­ry ini­ti­at­ed the century’s most impor­tant artis­tic move­ment. Art schol­ars debate whether the Demoi­selles should be con­sid­ered a Cubist paint­ing, but there is no ques­tion that it dif­fered pro­found­ly from all of the art that pre­ced­ed it, and that it began the devel­op­ment of Cubism.”\nPaint­ed in ambi­tious response to Hen­ri Matis­se’s Le Bon­heur de vivre, its rejec­tion of tra­di­tion­al for­mal­i­ty and beau­ty shocked even Picas­so’s for­ward-think­ing col­leagues: “Not only did Matisse denounce the paint­ing as an attempt to dis­cred­it mod­ern art, but even Georges Braque, who would lat­er join forces with Picas­so in devel­op­ing Cubism, was ini­tial­ly so shocked by the paint­ing that he com­pared Picas­so to the fair­ground fire-eaters who drank kerosene to spit flames.”\nOf course, there was also the mat­ter of the paint­ing’s sub­ject, five nude pros­ti­tutes in a Barcelona broth­el. But as explained by Beth Har­ris and Steven Zuck­er in the Smarthis­to­ry video above, the Demoi­selles was­n’t always about the demoi­selles alone. “In the orig­i­nal sketch­es, the women were focus­ing on a male that was includ­ed, a sailor,” says Zuck­er. “There was also a med­ical stu­dent.” At some stages, Har­ris empha­sizes, the lat­ter car­ried a human skull, a piece of pro­fes­sion­al equip­ment but also “a reminder of death, a memen­to mori. And so there seems to be some ten­sion here between the sen­su­al­i­ty that the sailor is indulging in and a mor­al­iz­ing reminder that the plea­sures of life are short”: an unusu­al per­spec­tive to be expressed by a 26-year-old, but then, Picas­so was­n’t the usu­al artist.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nPablo Picasso’s Child­hood Paint­ings: Pre­co­cious Works Paint­ed Between the Ages of 8 and 15\n14 Self-Por­traits by Pablo Picas­so Show the Evo­lu­tion of His Style: See Self-Por­traits Mov­ing from Ages 15 to 90\nWatch Pablo Picasso’s Cre­ative Process Unfold in Real-Time: Rare Footage Shows Him Cre­at­ing Draw­ings of Faces, Bulls & Chick­ens\nThou­sands of Pablo Picasso’s Works Now Avail­able in a New Dig­i­tal Archive\nWhat Makes Picasso’s Guer­ni­ca a Great Paint­ing?: Explore the Anti-Fas­cist Mur­al That Became a World­wide Anti-War Sym­bol\nHow to Under­stand a Picas­so Paint­ing: A Video Primer\n\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 2024, while Timo Fahler was out for a run in Los Angeles, he came across a discarded bedspring. It lingered in his studio for months until one day, its thirteen rows of springs revealed themselves as the red and white stripes of the American flag. It also turned out to be the last work he made in the U.S. before he and his family relocated to The Netherlands.\nFahler’s slouched “flag” is one of a number of recent stained glass sculptures on view in his solo exhibition Terminal Classic at Sebastian Gladstone that reference major changes in the artist’s personal life and the U.S.’s tumultuous socio-political climate. Time becomes slippery as he taps into imagery that is both contemporary and ancient.\n“flag” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 73 x 50 x 8 inches\nFahler often incorporates vibrant Mesoamerican motifs like skulls, serpents, and glyphs derived from Mayan codices. Through the likenesses of Mayan gods and imagery derived from ancient tombs, he explores dualities of past and present, ecological precarity, socio-economic and political divides, and the distances between people and places. Juxtaposed with centuries-old, non-Western motifs, Fahler also delves into deeply symbolic American iconography, like the Stars and Stripes and the bald eagle.\nThe latter, of course, is also a profound symbol in many Indigenous American cultures, emblematic of courage and wisdom. And despite the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental protections, the creature is also a stark reminder of the importance of conservation efforts. After dangerous pesticides reduced the total number of breeding pairs of bald eagles to only a little more than 400 in the 1960s, years of work by ecologists and a government-mandated ban on DDT finally allowed populations to rebound.\nThe White House is also an apt symbol for clashes of ideals, as the more than 230-year-old building represents American democracy and liberty while also being a place of contradictions. Enslaved people worked alongside other laborers to build it—information that has now been entirely omitted from histories touted by the Trump administration. The current president is also frequently condemned for his authoritarian leanings and his disregard for the country’s democratic foundations.\nIn Fahler’s piece “Idyllic, Idealic, Idea lick, i’d eel lick, i deal ick,” the structure is viewed through its Pennsylvania Avenue fence. Flattened like a stage backdrop, the White House seems to fade into the background as our attention is continually drawn to its cage-like barrier. The building sits, in a sense, within a prison of its own making.\n“Idyllic, Idealic, Idea lick, i’d eel lick, i deal ick” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 30.5 x 62 x 6 inches\n“Fences, gates, and beds all hold us in different ways—on our land, in our homes, in our sleep,” the gallery says. Fahler repeats the motif over and over, often using gates, chainlink, and window security grates to emphasize the contrast between inside and outside; confinement and freedom.\nTerminal Classic continues through December 13 in New York City. Find more on Fahler’s website and Instagram.\n“topos haliaeetus” (2022-23), steel, stained glass, lead, aluminum, cast-iron, and 52 caliber blank bullets, 26 x 41 x 3 inches\n“SKYBEARER” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 62 x 42 x 4 inches\nDetail of “flag”\n“BEWARE OF DOG (it’s just not that simple anymore)” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 50.75 x 47.25 x 6.25 inches\nDetail of “AH MUZEN CAB (the diving Bee god)”\n“It’s always been this way” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 32 x 23.5 x 6 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThrough large-scale tapestries of fringed strips of fabric, Abdoulaye Konaté explores the contemporary relevance of ancient signs and symbols. The Malian artist began working with textiles in the 1990s, when it became clear to him how prevalent they are in our everyday lives, from clothing and home goods to tools and more. This early interest began what’s become a research-driven artistic practice, and today, he layers long, stitched pieces of Bazin and Kente fabrics into dynamic, largely abstract works.\nKonaté and his team create each monumental tapestry entirely by hand, from the dyeing process to cutting and stitching. The final layout typically occurs on the studio floor after the artist sketches in marker and digitally refines this preliminary drawing to determine the exact composition.\n“Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo” (2024), textile, 264.5 × 524 centimeters\nMost works incorporate gradients that begin with lighter colors on the bottom before reaching deep navys, reds, and blacks up top. Patterns and various motifs often emerge from the gathered strips as a way to invoke the artist’s broad research interests from “Malian craftsmanship, Tibetan art, Tunisian ceramics, Berber textiles, etc,” says a statement from Templon.\n“Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo,” for example, features a geometric mark derived from the Manding people of West Africa. “I took this symbol and deconstructed it, breaking it down into a central element, and then I tried to rework it from both sides,” the artist shares in a video interview. This enormous piece—which stretches upwards of 17 feet long—also features small Kalao birds, which, for the Bambara tribe, represent wisdom and protection. They’re also thought to facilitate communication between our realm and the spiritual.\nDespite his commitment to textiles, the artist likens his work to painting and the ways it allows for self-expression. “The material changes, but I think of it as painting,” he adds.\nIf you’re in Paris, you can see Konaté’s most recent exhibition, Le tissu du réel, or The fabric of reality, on view at Templon through December 31.\n“Composition bleue avec losanges – motif Tibet” (2023), textile (Bazin and Kente), 242 × 224 centimeters\nDetail of “Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo” (2024), textile, 264.5 × 524 centimeters\nDetail of “Losange et triangle (bazin et kente) – ocre” (2024), textile, 266 × 397 centimeters\n“Bleu et vert aux carrés” (2024), textile, 211 × 150 centimeters\n“Vert Touareg (motif 2)” (2023), textile, 194 × 157 centimeters\nInstallation view of Photo by Tanguy Beurdeley\nInstallation view\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea that our perceived reality is shaped by our minds and reflecting our inner world,” says artist Michelle Blancke, whose ethereal photographs of trees, glens, and foliage invite us into a familiar yet uncanny world. Her lens-based practice explores themes of interdependence, consciousness, and concealment, especially through the subject of nature.\nBlancke’s vivid Secret Garden series comprises a total of five sub-categories: Realm, Ascent, Essence, Veins, and Origin. Whether capturing the waxy surface of an intricately veined leaf or the way vines create shadowy veils over gnarled trees, she’s interested in relationships between “transformation, mysticism, and the thin veil between the seen and the unseen,” she says. “When I enter woodland, it feels like stepping into a parallel space where something hidden becomes perceptible.”\n\nMuch of Blancke’s process involves walking—moving through forested areas until a certain atmosphere or interaction with sunlight resonates with her. “When I photograph, I’m responding to that feeling rather than to the literal scene in front of me,” she says. \nIt’s during digital post-production that Blancke begins to make more deliberate choices, shifting hues “to amplify the emotional tone I sensed in the moment,” she says. “The colours are a way of revealing an inner layer that already felt present while I was standing there. It’s an attempt to make the invisible atmosphere visible.”\nBlancke’s work is on view through January 25 as part of the 2025 Aesthetica Art Prize exhibition at York Art Gallery. She also works closely with BBA Gallery. Explore more on the artist’s website and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

In 2020, he won a Pulitzer Prize in criticism for his work evaluating the changes at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as the institution prepared for its forthcoming expansion, demonstrating “extraordinary community service by a critic.” Knight was previously named a finalist for the prize three times, in 1991, 2001, and 2007, and won the Dorothea and Leo Rabkin Foundation’s lifetime achievement award. His last column for the Los Angeles Times will run on December 1. “I'll keep writing, but after 45 years the daily journalism thing is done,” Knight told Hyperallergic in an email. “It has been a privilege, and it has been fun (mostly). Bless the readers!”Describing his career in art criticism as an “accident” in a podcast interview with Hyperallergic co-founder Hrag Vartanian in 2020, Knight got his start in the 1970s working as a curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, and later became a consultant for the Smithsonian Institution in Los Angeles and the Lannan Foundation. His first journalism job was at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.“One of the things I learned in art museums is that there are two audiences to be served,” Knight told Vartanian. “If you serve only the general public, the art public will abandon you. If you serve only the art public, the general public won't bother with you, because there are many other things for them to do. So I began to apply that to newspapers, which are pretty much the same thing.”In her note to staff, Gelt, a staff writer at the LA Times, described Knight as “everything a truly excellent critic should be.”\"It’s impossible to overstate the loss Knight’s departure represents for the paper and Los Angeles, or what a tireless, generous, inspiring colleague he is,” Gelt wrote.Christopher Knight on the Hyperallergic Podcast:Christopher Knight: The Critic Whose Love for LA Uplifted Its Arts CommunityThe veteran art critic has played a formidable role in helping to shape the world’s perception of contemporary art in Los Angeles.HyperallergicHrag Vartanian\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Art Criticism\n                      \n                      \n                        Christopher Knight\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

The black and white spray-painted work binds immigration crackdowns to an erosion of civil liberties more broadly. Reached by Hyperallergic, Groupp said he was paid $120 to create the work, but declined to state by whom.\"It visualizes a fear shared by millions: that the values we claim to stand for — justice, sanctuary, and freedom — are being detained and carried off in plain sight,\" Groupp said in a statement. \"It’s a reminder that freedom is never guaranteed; it must be defended.\"Groupp said he was inspired by Keith Haring. Groupp's scene of ICE arresting the Statue of Liberty punctuates a particularly notorious year in United States immigration history, one defined by the arrest of a pro-Palestinian student protester and green card holder, Mahmoud Khalil; the deportation of hundreds of men to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador; and the targeting of immigrants with no criminal history.The subway entrance artwork continues a renewed use of the Statue of Liberty as an anti-Trump symbol. In a Northern French town earlier this year, Dutch street artist Judith de Leeuw portrayed a massive Statue of Liberty in a gesture of shame as a commentary against the Trump administration's deportation policies. In the spring, the White House rebuked a comment by a French politician calling for the repatriation of the sculpture, which has occupied the New York harbor since 1886.Groupp's piece echoes guerrilla artworks by the collective Vjaybombs, which projected portrayals of ICE agents arresting Jesus in Los Angeles earlier this fall.The artist said he was paid $120 to create the artwork.In a statement to Hyperallergic, Groupp said that his work has not always been overtly political but that \"recent events\" have pushed him to make it so. He added that he drew inspiration for this design from the work of Keith Haring, who transformed the subway system into a canvas for political chalk art calling attention to issues including the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\"After sketching the image across several digital platforms, I realized that referencing Keith Haring’s visual economy made the message stronger,\" Groupp said. \"Reducing the imagery to its simplest form—almost like a subway drawing—allowed the idea to speak more forcefully. Haring’s work was an act of defiance in itself: immediate, public, and unapologetically provocative. That spirit felt essential to the message.\"\"Attack on Liberty\" has been vandalized twice, Groupp said. Images shared with Hyperallergic show the work tagged with \"communist\" and \"dead.\" Groupp has been regularly touching up the piece.Groupp said he plans to offer prints for sale through his Instagram with proceeds directed toward the New York Immigration Coalition's Emergency Justice Fund. The work will remain on view through January.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        ICE\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                  \n        ",

There were two of her, really.One was the photographer featured in a current retrospective at Tate Britain, who was born in New York in 1907, moved to Paris in 1929, and then to London. She went to Europe in restless pursuit of the desire for others to believe in everything she had to offer — her multiple gifts as an artist, for example.The other was a model. Modeling in New York in the 1920s was her opening gambit. She had the looks and poise to succeed and her talents were quickly recognized. She arrived in Paris in the flapper era — sinuously tall, her hair close-cropped. My goodness, that wonderful androgynous look! She seemed made for the part — and the historical moment.But modeling had its limitations. Was there not too much idle self-regard in that ready capitulation to another’s camera? Perhaps. She had too much energy and ambition to be someone else’s glamorous image of the passing moment.Arnold Genthe, \"Lee Miller, New York\" (c. 1927) (photo Michael Glover/Hyperallergic)So she went to work for Man Ray in Paris. She modeled for him — but it was much more than that. They worked together on Surrealist experimentation. She took pictures and did some odd freakery on them: solarization, deep shadow, the isolating of strange and provocative detail. They collaborated, but unsurprisingly she did not get full credit for what she did. He tended to claim that what emerged from the studio of Man Ray (emphasis on Man?) was his. She needed to wrest back control, to be the one calling the shots. She returned to London in 1939 and worked as a fashion photographer for Vogue magazine. The shadows of war loomed over. Her art began to take on a new urgency, and to strike a note that any small and embattled country needs to strike if it is to retain its morale, its need to fight back against a dangerously predatory enemy.Lee Miller, \"David E. Scherman dressed for war, London\" (1942) (Lee Miller Archives © Lee Miller Archives, England 2025, all rights reserved, leemiller.co.uk)She made images of women in the not-so-glamorous clothing that wartime demanded, but she did it with style and aplomb — in Miller’s hands, the stuff of war looked positively alluring. In addition to the working women, she photographed the London Blitz. In one photograph, a bomb-blasted gap in a London terrace looks like a conscious act of framing. She posed a model in a ruined street, as if a fleeting instance of beauty could defy the casual barbarism of war. She showed her great courage in roaming those dangerous streets to produce images that were odd, spirited, and spirit-lifting, too — and possessed a quality of defiant humor. Following this, Miller went to Europe to work as an accredited war correspondent with the US Army. Nothing fazed her. She was determined to stare hard into the face of the awful reality of evil on its filthy rampage. Lee Miller, \"Untitled, Paris\" (1930) (Lee Miller Archives © Lee Miller Archives, England 2025, all rights reserved, leemiller.co.uk)She had her friend, Life magazine photographer David Scherman, photograph her bathing in Hitler’s bathtub at his abandoned residence in Munich the day of his suicide in Berlin — that old mix of defiance, poignance, and brazen, oddball humor. She went to the Nazi concentration camps and photographed the worst things that any human being might ever witness. This gallery has a warning notice: not for children. I was told not to photograph her images so I can’t show you what she saw. Lee Miller pushed herself to the limits and beyond, and suffered for it. In later life, she returned to a farm in Sussex and became a gourmet chef, leaving behind the nightmares that she captured on film.Lee Miller, \"Portrait of Space, Al Bulwayeb near Siwa\" (1937) (Lee Miller Archives © Lee Miller Archives, England 2025, all rights reserved, leemiller.co.uk)Lee Miller, \"Fire Masks, Downshire Hill, London\" (1941) (photo Michael Glover/Hyperallergic)Lee Miller continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through February 15, 2026.

    "body": "\n    \n                Art Review\n                The nonagenarian artist insists that women’s bodies are interesting for more than their eroticism.\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Detail of Joan Semmel, \"Mythologies and Me\" (1976), oil on collage canvas (all photos Lisa Yin Zhang/Hyperallergic)\n    \n        \n            Joan Semmel’s paintings of contorted women — sometimes realist, sometimes surreal or abstracted — are mesmerizing and beautiful, but they are also disturbing. When her work is framed as such, the focus is typically shifted to the viewer: It unsettles because we’re used to media depictions of young, taut bodies, or it forces us to confront our own relationship with beauty standards and aging. I think that flattens her work. These paintings are far weirder than they get credit for.The 16 paintings in the one-room exhibition Joan Semmel: In the Flesh at the Jewish Museum constitute a sampling of various series from her half-century career, with a section in the center dedicated to works the artist selected from the museum’s collection. Toward the middle of the chronological review is “Horizon With Hands” (1976) — even its title is disquieting, suggesting a fusion of landscape and flesh. The bulk of the square painting is almost featureless; we could be looking at an expanse of stone or a rippling dune. It is the hands along the top edge that orient us: Follow an arm around the right side, and it clicks that we are the vantage point, looking down on our torso, a slab of torqued flesh — it takes a beat longer than is normal, or comfortable, to recognize a depiction of the body. Upon that realization, I felt a sense of dreamy, claustrophobic paralysis: Who am I, how did I find myself here? I wanted so badly to see a finger twitch, to feel in control of myself again within this alien form. Joan Semmel, \"Horizon with Hands\" (1976), oil on canvasA similar destabilization results from looking upon “Purple Diagonal” (1980), whose title also suggests a figure abstracted, even obliterated. A realistic prone body, encased Escher-like in a colorful squiggly outline, offers the key: The larger composition is a doubled form of this smaller vignette, which sits embedded in the right thigh of a heavily abstracted figure. Suddenly, that heap of lurid, dashed strokes in the foreground snaps into focus as a torso — and not just any, but ours. The uncanniness is nested, deliberate. Semmel does not just double the figure but makes it flicker between body and not-body, ours and nothing. Refusing to settle into an object, the human form remains stranger and more powerful, something that resists being held down as any one thing. For that reason, I refuse to call these paintings “erotic,” a word so often associated with Semmel’s work. Instead, they insist that women’s bodies are interesting for more than their eroticism. Joan Semmel, \"Purple Diagonal\" (1980), oil on canvasSimilarly, while old and older women are certainly visually underrepresented, Semmel’s depictions go further than mere representation, which can still enact tokenization and generate indifference or even repulsion. Instead, she renders them compelling, which is more interesting and important than rendering them beautiful — the terms to which her project is so often reduced. I love the delightfully strange push-and-pull of “Parade” (2023), in which wet paint trickles downward, mirroring the physical and emotive droop of the figure, while the energetic vertical brushstrokes form the painting’s spine, holding it rigorously upright. It models a way of looking at and thinking about the aging body that expands its visibility rather than just reproducing it. Though the viewer doesn’t quite become the figure depicted in these paintings, we are drawn into a plane organized entirely by its presence. Its unsettling details — the close crop, the magenta of her barely seen face, the flurry of strokes toward the top that may or may not represent a hand — pull you into the painting's logic, forcing you to inhabit its disorienting perspective.Joan Semmel, \"Parade\" (2023), oil on canvasMany of the works from the collection Semmel selected for this show extend that uncanny charge, engaging with womanhood through depicting bodies in subtly strange ways — and they're not necessarily by women, underlining that representation alone isn't what's at stake here. In Arnold Newman's 1972 photograph of Louise Nevelson, a black monolith containing the artist’s visage interrupts the composition like one of her own sculptures, foregrounding those commanding hands that generated an entirely new artistic vocabulary. Here is the body rendered strange, made into the kind of visual puzzle Nevelson explored in her work. Semmel operates from the same principle. As she often responds when asked how she feels putting herself on display: “It isn't me. It's the painting.”Arnold Newman, \"Louise Nevelson, New York\" (1972), gelatin silver printInstallation view of Joan Semmel: In the FleshJoan Semmel: In the Flesh continues at the Jewish Museum (1109 5th Ave & East 92nd Street, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through May 31, 2026.

(cover by Jason Seiler; courtesy of TIME/TIME Person of the Year)\n    \n        \n            TIME Magazine announced that its 2025 Person of the Year is the collective “Architects of AI.” But Chicago-based illustrator Jason Seiler's representation of a handful of those honored for the magazine cover has generated more ire than the selection itself. While none of us are happy to see Elon Musk's face associated with the award for the second time, many are taking aim at Seiler's reimagining of one of the most famous historical photographs in the world. “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,” taken in 1932 by an unknown artist, depicts 11 construction workers seated along a steel beam, part of the skeletal framework of what we now know as 30 Rockefeller Plaza, suspended some 850 feet (~259m) in the air as Manhattan's architecture sprawls out behind them. In his cover illustration, Seiler replaces the rugged, tough crew with the likes of a weirdly purple Musk, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang of NVIDIA, and Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices among other key figures credited with today's AI boom. Unknown maker, “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper” (1932), distributed by Acme Newspictures (public domain via Wikimedia Commons)The tech oligarchs, decked out in sports jackets and cardigans with laptops and iPhones at the ready, look self-important in their superimposed positions along the beam, talking past each other or interacting with nobody in particular while suspended over the cityscape. Regardless of how each of them got their beginnings, these “Architects of AI” are as far removed as one can be from the grease, metal, and casually life-threatening labor depicted in the original photo — rather, they reap disproportionate benefits from the contemporary equivalent of said exploitation. All responses to TIME's Person of the Year announcement on X. (screenshot Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)In the original, we get an idealized glimpse into the life and labor of the city's historically immigrant-heavy, under-valued workforce as they create a world far above our heads with skillsets far beyond our reach. Today, we're looking at CEOs and other inflated, out-of-touch executives who have overreached into every aspect of our world to create something that makes our own basic to hard-earned skills nearly obsolete. Netizens across the world have expressed their disgust with the cover, denigrating it as ragebait, a mockery of the “most iconic blue-collar image of all time,” and a “puff piece about the rich people destroying our world.” Many also argue that TIME and Seiler only ingratiate the figureheads who already take all the credit for the AI boom rather than the engineers, scientists, researchers, and other actual “AI architects” responsible for developing the rapidly evolving technology. Comments from TIME's Instagram post featuring the cover (screenshot Rhea Nayyar/Hyperallergic)TIME's Person of the Year designation has never been about highlighting morality. Per the magazine's own description, it's about identifying the person, entity, or group that “for better or for worse ... has done the most to influence the events of the year.” To my own dismay, I concede to the reality that the featured “Architects of AI” have influenced my life in one way or another. I still use X, I'm completely dependent on Google Maps, I've had to break out ChatGPT on a couple of occasions to find specific articles from before 2016, and I even rode the Dall E and Midjourney merry-go-rounds when the generative image models became accessible to the public. With and without our consent, our digital existence has inextricably become fodder for machine learning, so much so that it's punitive to opt out if you even have the option to.To that degree, are we not the unwilling Architects of AI as well? We've inadvertently and thanklessly developed this new world derived entirely from our scholarship and inventions, our imaginations and creative output, our relationships and personal discoveries, our physical labor, our histories and archives, our digital lives and interactions, and so on.  TIME may have already made all of us the Person of the Year in 2006 during the surge of accessible digital presence, but it's not like the publication isn't above recycling.  I can at least give the magazine credit for commissioning an actual illustrator for the cover, and he succeeded in generating a lot of publicity with his design choices. At the end of the day, even “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper” was a curated image deployed as a publicity stunt for Rockefeller Center, commissioned by a dynasty built on the backs of workers. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Time magazine\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            I just bought a $117 raffle ticket in the hope of winning a $1 million Picasso painting. It's for a good cause, okay? I've never won a single prize in my life, but I can't stop thinking about how good that little Picasso would look on my living room wall, and how humble I'd be when guests asked about it. I guess I paid for the fantasy, more than anything.Sonya Yu, a Bay Area art collector and entrepreneur, is someone who probably can afford a Picasso without a raffle. She has written off three years of admission fees for MoMA PS1 in Queens, New York, making entry to the museum free for everyone. How kind.Less fortunate are faculty members at the New School in Manhattan. A staggering 40% of them have received buyouts or early retirement offers. No wonder they went out in the cold this week to protest against the decision. The school says it has no other choice, as it faces a $48 million deficit.In better news, Jennifer Samet's popular column Beer With a Painter is back. It's a series of in-depth interviews with painters about their practice. This month, Jennifer speaks with artist Melissa Joseph, whose intimate felt paintings truly expand the medium.And as the year draws to an end, we look back on the art, books, and memes that defined 2025.

    "body": "\n    \n                Interview\n                The 83-year-old artist has dubbed her painterly detonations of color, which physically undulate from their surfaces, as “structural abstract expressionism.”\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n        \n            Sylvia Snowden in 2024 (photo by Nick Singleton, courtesy White Cube)Sylvia Snowden has a curiosity about the human condition that begets active, engrossing paintings. Her canvases hover delicately between figuration and abstraction, evoking abundant movement and energy. Standing before the artworks feels electric — like something in you is being activated, previously suppressed emotions riled to attention.Snowden and I met in November, after her solo exhibition opened at White Cube New York. On the Verge gathers 20 of her paintings across two floors, on view through December 19. Our conversation began with her affinity for color and its potency, a lesson from childhood imparted by her beloved mother, who adored vibrant hues. “Color is life,” Snowden declared. “Without color, what would you have?”The heart of the exhibition is her M Street series — abstractly rendered portraits of bodies with engorged extremities. While they are not depictions of individual people, they are named after her neighbors from the eponymous street in Washington, DC, where she has lived since 1978 and raised her children. Their purpose, however, illustrates something more universal about the nuances of human emotion.Sylvia Snowden, \"Theresa Black\" (1997) (left) and \"Steven Thornhill\" (1979) (right), both acrylic and oil pastel on Masonite, in On the Verge at White Cube (photo Jasmine Weber/Hyperallergic)Snowden was raised on the Dillard University and Southern University campuses in New Orleans by parents who introduced her to artmaking. She received her Bachelor of Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees from Howard University in the 1960s. There, she studied under James A. Porter, Loïs Mailou Jones, and James Lesesne Wells, titans of midcentury Black art. Her work has been displayed at the National Gallery of Art, Baltimore Museum of Art, and Montclair Art Museum, among others.At age 83, she still paints every day. Her approach to texture, which she dichotomizes as both visual and tactile, has been developing since age four. She uses acrylic paint and oil pastels on masonite, an innovation born out of a residency in Australia, where she wasn't able to procure enough oil paint and knew her canvases would not dry in time to be shipped home. (Also, her children “could not stand the smell of turpentine,” she told me.) The resulting artworks are thrilling impastos, sculptural in quality. She has fittingly identified these detonations of color, which physically undulate from their surfaces, as “structural abstract expressionism.”I spoke with Snowden near White Cube in Manhattan about her schooling, family, and making the first mark on canvas. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Hyperallergic: I would love to start at the beginning and talk about your roots as an artist. So, how did you come to find painting?Sylvia Snowden: My mother, Jessie B. Snowden, is the one who introduced my brother and me at a very young age — age four — to painting and to color. My mother knew a lot about color and wore color, and she introduced us to it. Now, when I was four, what we did was — I don't know if kids do this now or not — use coloring books.H: Yeah.SS: They still do?H: Yeah. I bet a lot of the time, they do it on their iPad; they color it in on the iPad. [Laughs]SS: Oh, I see. That didn't happen with me. [Laughs] This was a coloring book with crayons. And so that's how I learned how to make what is known as the “visual texture,” as a texture that you make yourself. So what you make it on remains the same as the feel of it. And I learned how to use color that way. My brother, who did a lot of painting, did what is known as — what we call now — Color Field. His work was really beautiful, but he left that art stuff, kids' stuff, and went on to law, and I sort of stayed in it.Sylvia Snowden, \"M Street – Sandra (Haberon Series)\" (1978), acrylic and oil pastel on Masonite (© Sylvia Snowden; photo © Andy Keate; image courtesy Edel Assanti, Franklin Parrasch Gallery, and White Cube)I went to Howard University, the College of Fine Arts, and that was the most beautiful teaching experience about life and art that anybody could ever have. The department of art, which was headed by a man named James A. Porter. Genius, no doubt about it. He wrote a book [Modern Negro Art] that is still used now. He was most articulate and knew everything about American Black artists. I'm not good at talking about my work. I don’t like to do that. I paint, that's the way I communicate. I don't use words. But let me tell you what he told me: He said part of my getting a degree, I had to talk about my work, and he knew I couldn't. And so he told me that if you don't talk about your work, you won't get your degree, because that's part of the requirement. That took a long time for me to swallow. He explained to me, “You're going to be called upon to talk about your art. And you can't say, ‘oh, I can't do it.’ You're going to have to learn how to do it.”He was really responsible for my going to Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. I got a first-place award. And what they did, Skowhegan, three or four years ago, is they invited all the people who had a first award for that particular summer to come back, and they have a studio and paint, sculpt, whatever you did. And I did that. And some of the people came to the [White Cube] opening last night.Sylvia Snowden, \"Ethel Moyd\" (1984), acrylic and oil pastel on Masonite (© Sylvia Snowden; photo © White Cube; photo by Frankie Tyska)H: Did you know, when you were a student, what type of art you wanted to make?SS: No. You know, who really pushed me more into that was David Driskell. I like David Driskell. He was a student of all those other people [James A. Porter, Lois Mailou Jones, and James Lesesne Wells].Amazing things happened with James A. Porter. He wanted us to experience so many things. Our classes did fresco painting. Fresco painting! We had a plasterer come up, and [install] a four-feet-by-four-feet plaque, and you had to do a painting, and it stayed up there for a semester, then it was taken down for the next class. But it was actually fresco painting. A lot of people at some prestigious schools had never even heard of fresco. But at Black Howard, we did it. When I was there, that was the place. In the whole wide world.H: What's your process of creation when you first start off with a blank Masonite — is it secret? Do you keep it close to the vest?SS: No, no. Do you know the hardest things to do? Make that first mark on that white canvas. That's the hardest mark, because that can dictate so many things about the painting.H: From making that first mark to completion, are you letting the artwork take shape as you're creating, or do you go into it with an idea of exactly what you want this to look like?SS: Oh, no, it expands because I grow within making the art. I don't go in there with a picture in mind, and take from my mind that picture, and put it down. I take an idea, and the use of certain colors, and the idea is expressed through a number of paintings. That's why I do paintings in series. One painting does not fulfill everything I want to think about that particular subject matter. So I keep going some, because I could get a complete look at it from my vantage point.H: You call your work “structural abstract expressionism.” I'm curious how you would define that, how you would define your work.SS: Abstract expressionism is subdivided into three areas. There's action painting, like Jackson Pollock. Then there's symbolic, that's painting that's based on symbols that we use in our environment. And then you can use something that's based on the figure of what you see, the structure of what you see. So that is structural abstract expressionism.Sylvia Snowden, \"Untitled (Purple Hand)\" (2002) at White Cube (photo Jasmine Weber/Hyperallergic)H: The influence of M Street really looms large in the series that you've named after it.SS: If you don't have a certain status in life, you're forgotten. So I gave those [paintings] names [of] people who were forgotten before they died. The trucks would come in front of the house, and I’d put the names of the people on the back of the painting. They didn't pay attention to the paintings that much, because in order to see abstract painting in this society, we have to be taught. In other societies, the art is related to the people. But not here. But they saw their names on the back: “Oh, that’s me! That’s me!” It gave them a warm feeling. Somebody cares enough of me to represent me. That's the whole idea — that we're human beings and we all have the same feelings. We all have the same personality needs, but they come out differently in the sense that they're more intense in some people than others.H: I've read that you create work every day.SS: I paint every day. I do. That's fortunate. I'm very fortunate to be able to do that. I'm fortunate with my kids; they respect that. Shell, my daughter, will call me asking, “What am I doing?” I said, “I'm painting.” “Okay, I'll call you back.” I was painting before she was born, so they grew up with respect for what I do. And I very much appreciate that.H: You grew up on these university campuses, and your parents were really encouraging you and your brother to make work. Did that continue as you got older?SS: They didn't encourage me to become an artist. Believe me, they understood. That was laying down poverty lane. But they also understood that it was important to do what you felt passionate about, and they realized that, and they were really supportive. I mean, they bought paint — an enormous amount of paint — for me, even after my kids. I had good parents. Good parents. My brother and I knew we were loved. My kids knew they were loved.\n                  \n                      \n                        Interview\n                      \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Sylvia Snowden\n                      \n                      \n                        White Cube\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tThe HeadlinesCALLING TIME. The director of Tate in London, Maria Balshaw, will step down in spring 2026 after nearly a decade in the role, the institution said in a press release. Balshaw, who joined in 2017 after leading Manchester Art Gallery and the Whitworth, succeeded Nicholas Serota following his 29-year tenure. She called her time at Tate a privilege and said the institution is well positioned for new leadership. During her directorship, Balshaw oversaw major exhibitions including “Van Gogh and Britain,” “Yoko Ono,” and “Sargent and Fashion.” Her final project will be a large-scale Tracey Emin survey at Tate Modern next year. Tate highlighted Balshaw’s efforts to diversify the collection and expand its global scope, noting that membership grew to 150,000 under her leadership. Chair Roland Rudd praised her commitment to widening public access to art and supporting a broader range of artists. Balshaw’s departure comes amid financial strain. Tate has recently cut about 40 jobs to reduce costs and is operating with a deficit budget for 2024–25. Staff have staged walkouts over pay, citing poor working conditions. Visitor numbers also remain below pre-pandemic levels, with significant drops at Tate Modern, Tate Britain, and Tate St Ives.GIMME THE LOOT. The Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Asian Art said it will return three Khmer Empire sculptures to Cambodia as part of its commitment to removing unlawfully obtained objects from its collection. The works—Head of Harihara, The Goddess Uma, and Prajnaparamita—are believed to have been looted more than 50 years ago during Cambodia’s civil conflict. The New York Times reports that after Cambodian officials questioned the provenance of Khmer works in the museum’s holdings, curators reviewed acquisition files and found missing export permits and evidence that the objects had passed through known traffickers. According to museum director Chase F. Robinson, the circumstances raised significant ethical concerns. The returns are the first under a Smithsonian-wide policy adopted in 2022 that urges all 21 museums to consider broader historical factors—including colonial-era plunder and illicit trade during periods of war—when evaluating repatriation claims. Cambodia’s culture ministry welcomed the Smithsonian’s openness, noting that decades of unrest left the country vulnerable to looting. Officials are now discussing ways for the works to remain on view through partnership agreements. The move aligns with similar efforts at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, which is preparing to return 13 Cambodian objects linked to the late dealer Douglas A. J. Latchford, whose network has been tied to widespread art trafficking.The DigestThe US Senate unanimously approved the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery (HEAR) Act of 2025 on December 10. The bill renews and expands the original 2016 legislation, which is set to expire in 2026, and aims to help heirs reclaim art looted during the Holocaust by extending the time they have to file claims. [The Art Newspaper]The UC Irvine Langson Orange County Museum has appointed Kathryn Kanjo as its new director. Kanjo, who has spent the past nine years as director and CEO of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, becomes the first leader of the institution, which was officially established in October. [Artforum]A hearth dating back 400,000 years was discovered near the village of Barnham in England.

[CNN]ART SG, Southeast Asia’s leading art fair, returns to Marina Bay Sands from January 23-25, and will mark the first time it co-organizes and hosts boutique local fair S.E.A. Focus in the same venue. [Ocula]The KickerINSIDE THE TENT. With Art Basel Miami Beach in the rearview mirror, the Observer’s Elisa Carollo takes a deeper look at the fair’s buzziest new section, Zero 10, dedicated to digital art. While the new section was a clear vote of approval for a sector that has long struggled for validation from the traditional art world, Carollo speaks with major figures in digital art about what the field might gain—or lose—from that integration. Decentralization, a new art ecosystem, and a very different audience of collectors have always been central to digital art’s appeal. Is there a way forward that allows digital art to plug into Art Basel and other traditional art enterprises without sacrificing those defining features? It’s anyone’s guess. But what is certain is that the crypto world has a mountain of liquidity that the art market could benefit from right now.\n",

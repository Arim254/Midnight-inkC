    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nMichael Jack­son’s Thriller is the best-sell­ing album of all time, and not by a par­tic­u­lar­ly slim mar­gin. The most recent fig­ures have it reg­is­tered at 51.3 mil­lion copies, as against the 31.2 mil­lion notched by the run­ner up, AC/DC’s Back in Black. But it would sure­ly be a clos­er call with­out the title song’s cel­e­brat­ed music video, thir­teen John Lan­dis-direct­ed min­utes full of not just singing and danc­ing, but also clas­sic-style Hol­ly­wood mon­sters, some of them doing that singing and danc­ing them­selves. Hal­loween night is, of course, the best time to revis­it Michael Jack­son’s Thriller, as it’s offi­cial­ly titled. This year, why not chase it with the behind-the-scenes doc­u­men­tary below, Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller?\nYounger fans may not know that “Thriller” was­n’t even released as a sin­gle until Novem­ber of 1983: about a year after the album itself, which had already spun off six songs, includ­ing enor­mous hits like “Bil­lie Jean” and “Beat It.” In fact, Jack­son’s unprece­dent­ed vision for the album had been that every song could be a hit, with no filler in between.\nThe high­er-ups at Epic Records felt that its pop­u­lar­i­ty, how­ev­er sen­sa­tion­al to that point, had just about run its course. That made them unwill­ing, at first, to put out “Thriller” on its own, as did the song’s campy scary-movie lyrics, sound effects, and “rap” by none oth­er than Vin­cent Price, the embod­i­ment of old-Hol­ly­wood hor­ror. (This sort of thing was­n’t with­out prece­dent: with his sib­lings, Jack­son had cre­at­ed a sim­i­lar spooky atmos­phere in “This Place Hotel,” from 1980.)\n\n\n\t\n\nStill, at that point in his rise to the kind of fame no cul­tur­al fig­ure may ever know again, Jack­son under­stood much that the old guard did­n’t. He knew that “Thriller” could suc­ceed, not just as a song on the radio, but a mul­ti­me­dia cul­tur­al phe­nom­e­non. It would, of course, need a music video, but not one that mere­ly met the (still fair­ly lax) stan­dards of MTV. Impressed by the hor­ror, com­e­dy, and visu­al effects of John Lan­dis’ An Amer­i­can Were­wolf in Lon­don, Jack­son called up Lan­dis and asked him to direct what he’d been envi­sion­ing for “Thriller” at fea­ture-film pro­duc­tion val­ues. The $500,000 bud­get came from tele­vi­sion net­works like MTV and Show­time, offi­cial­ly for broad­cast­ing rights to Mak­ing Michael Jack­son’s Thriller.\nThe doc­u­men­tary cap­tures var­i­ous aspects of the video’s cre­ation, from cast­ing to chore­og­ra­phy to shoot­ing to make­up, that last being an espe­cial­ly painstak­ing process over­seen by indus­try mas­ter Rick Bak­er. What­ev­er the rig­ors of the pro­duc­tion, Jack­son dis­plays undis­guised enjoy­ment of it all in this footage, per­haps fore­see­ing that it would cul­mi­nate in the kind of expres­sion that could come from no oth­er artist. Though an intense­ly col­lab­o­ra­tive effort, Michael Jack­son’s Thriller is true to its name in ulti­mate­ly being the prod­uct of a sin­gle, guid­ing per­for­ma­tive sen­si­bil­i­ty, some­how both uni­ver­sal­ly appeal­ing and high­ly idio­syn­crat­ic at the same time. Jack­son’s insis­tence on call­ing his music videos “short films” may have been regard­ed as a typ­i­cal eccen­tric­i­ty, but nev­er was the label more appro­pri­ate than when he brought back the old-school mon­ster movie one last, funky time.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” Video Changed Pop Cul­ture For­ev­er: Revis­it the 13-Minute Short Film Direct­ed by John Lan­dis\nHear “Starlight,” Michael Jackson’s Ear­ly Demo of “Thriller”: A Ver­sion Before the Lyrics Were Rad­i­cal­ly Changed\nWhen Mar­tin Scors­ese Direct­ed Michael Jack­son in the 18-Minute “Bad” Music Video & Paid Cin­e­mat­ic Trib­ute to West Side Sto­ry (1986)\nHow Michael Jack­son Wrote a Song: A Close Look at How the King of Pop Craft­ed “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough”\nJohn Lan­dis Decon­structs Trail­ers of Great 20th Cen­tu­ry Films: Cit­i­zen Kane, Sun­set Boule­vard, 2001 & More\nWhere Zom­bies Come From: A Video Essay on the Ori­gin of the Hor­ri­fy­ing, Satir­i­cal Mon­sters\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Literature |   \tOctober 31st, 2025  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOf the many read­ings and adap­ta­tions of Edgar Allan Poe’s clas­sic moody-broody poem “The Raven,” none is more fun than The Simp­sons’, in which Lisa Simpson’s intro tran­si­tions into the read­ing voice of James Earl Jones and the slap­stick inter­jec­tions of Homer as Poe’s avatar and Bart as the tit­u­lar bird. Jones’ solo read­ing of the poem is not to be missed and exists in sev­er­al ver­sions on YouTube.\nBut Jones is not the only clas­si­cal­ly creepy actor to have mas­tered Poe’s dic­tion. Above, we have Christo­pher Walken, whose unset­tling weird­ness is always tinged with a cer­tain wry humor, per­haps an effect of his clas­si­cal New York accent.\nAccom­pa­ny­ing Walken’s read­ing are the stan­dard eerie wind sounds and the unusu­al addi­tion of some dis­tort­ed met­al gui­tar: per­haps an intru­sion, per­haps a unique dra­mat­ic effect. The visu­al com­po­nent, a mon­tage of expres­sive pen­cil draw­ings, also may or may not work for you.\n\n\n\t\n\nYou may wish to con­trast this pro­duc­tion with what may be the locus clas­si­cus for tele­vi­su­al inter­pre­ta­tions of “The Raven.” Of course I mean the ham­my Vin­cent Price read­ing (above), which lent so much aes­thet­i­cal­ly to The Simp­sons par­o­dy. One of my favorite lit­tle in-jokes in the lat­ter occurs dur­ing Bart and Lisa’s intro­duc­tion. Bart whines, “that looks like a school-book!” and Lisa replies, “don’t wor­ry, Bart. You won’t learn any­thing.”\nLisa’s rejoin­der is a sly ref­er­ence to Poe’s con­tempt for lit­er­a­ture meant to instruct or mor­al­ize, a ten­den­cy he called “the heresy of the Didac­tic.” Poe’s the­o­ry and prac­tice grew out of his desire that lit­er­a­ture have a “uni­ty of effect,” that it pro­duce an aes­thet­ic expe­ri­ence sole­ly through the author’s skill­ful use of lit­er­ary form. Poe may have antic­i­pat­ed and direct­ly influ­enced the French sym­bol­ists and oth­er aes­thetes like Oscar Wilde, but his assured place in high cul­ture has thank­ful­ly not got­ten in the way of pop appro­pri­a­tions of his more odd­ball tales, like “The Raven.” A peren­ni­al favorite read­ing of the poem is clas­sic hor­ror actor Christo­pher Lee’s (below), which may be the most straight­for­ward­ly creepy of them all.\n\n\n\t\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2013.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nEdgar Allan Poe’s the Raven: Watch an Award-Win­ning Short Film That Mod­ern­izes Poe’s Clas­sic Tale\nÉdouard Manet Illus­trates Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven, in a French Edi­tion Trans­lat­ed by Stephane Mal­lar­mé (1875)\nHear Lou Reed’s The Raven, a Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe Fea­tur­ing David Bowie, Ornette Cole­man, Willem Dafoe & More\nThe Grate­ful Dead Pays Trib­ute to Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” in a 1982 Con­cert: Hear “Raven Space”\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.\n\t\t\n        \t",

Uniquely stunning, all 62 structures in Modern Tree Houses respond to the surrounding environment, whether a tiny, winterized pod for escaping the snow or a split-level playground complete with climbing ropes and nests. Built by architects and amateurs alike, each dwelling is varied in material, layout, purpose, and aesthetic, although all thrive because of their proximity to nature’s beauty.\n“Modern tree houses are proof that happiness doesn’t have to be built big—just built right,” author Florian Siebeck says, presenting an array of spaces from luxurious escapes to children’s hideouts.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJacky Connolly, “The Mineral Kingdom (Dark Green)” (2025),\nvideo installation, color, sound, light, 37 min, looped, dimensions variable (courtesy the artist, image courtesy Taipei Fine Arts Museum)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe 14th edition of the Taipei Biennial, Whispers on the Horizon, opens on November 1 at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM). Curated by Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath (Directors of Hamburger Bahnhof – Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart, Berlin), the exhibition brings together about 150 works by 72 artists from 37 cities, featuring 34 new commissions and site-specific installations spanning painting, sculpture, film, photography, and performance. \nWhispers on the Horizon explores yearning as an enduring human drive that reaches beyond the possible, speaking of the future through quiet insistence rather than proclamation. Its conceptual framework centers on three modest yet charged objects drawn from Taiwan’s literary and cinematic works — absent from the galleries but shaping the exhibition’s emotional and temporal arc. The puppet from Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s The Puppetmaster (1993) embodies perseverance through eras of occupation and renewal; the diary in Chen Yingzhen’s My Kid Brother Kangxiong (1960) captures a generation’s struggle between conviction and disillusion; and the bicycle in Wu Ming-Yi’s The Stolen Bicycle (2015) evokes loss, inheritance, and belonging. Together, they form an invisible architecture for the Biennial: the puppet as continuity, the diary as interiority, and the bicycle as pursuit — three intertwined expressions of yearning.\nThe Biennial weaves contemporary works with around 30 pieces from the Taipei Fine Arts Museum’s collection. In dialogue with the new art, these collection pieces act not as static artifacts but as living agents of yearning, bridging past and present to foster intergenerational conversation. Suspended textile partitions replace solid walls in an echo of the exhibitions themes, creating permeable thresholds and open sightlines that foster a rhythm of visibility and connection. \n“We want to create a Biennial that could only exist here — one that listens to the histories, languages, and contradictions that make Taipei what it is. Our dialogue with TFAM’s collection was not an act of nostalgia but of grounding: an insistence that the local, when deeply engaged, becomes a lens for the world. In Whispers on the Horizon, yearning is that bridge — it begins in the intimacy of memory and extends into a shared horizon where the local turns universal,” said Bardaouil and Fellrath.\nExhibition Highlights\nThe ground floor features works devoted to craft, memory, and care as acts of survival, including Ciou Zih-Yan’s “Fake Airfield” (2025), which reconstructs a decoy airstrip from the Japanese colonial era. Also on view are “Out in the Fields” (1934) by Chen Chin, whose paintings of elegant women came to symbolize a Taiwan in search of its identity, and Afra Al Dhaheri’s “Weighted PAUSE” (2025), in which meditative looped rope arrangements invite viewers to contemplate slowness as a form of resistance.\nThe basement level centers on the body as both witness and vessel of transformation. Through rhythmically crushed stone and glass vessels, Ivana Bašić shapes the act of breathing into sculpture in “Passion of Pneumatics” (2020–24) and “Metanoia” (2025). A 1956 photograph by the late Syu Ching-Pwo, “Confidence,” captures two men leaning close in conversation, separating and connecting at once, while Jacky Connolly’s “The Mineral Kingdom (Dark Green)” (2025) uses dreamlike imagery to merge memory with virtual terrain, turning personal grief into digital landscapes.\nOn the upper level, the works trace an artistic lineage driven by the desire to perceive, interpret, and connect — collectively reimagining the world through the lens of yearning. Liu Kuo-Sung breaks from traditional ink painting to develop new abstract forms in “Floating Mountain” (1971) as Eva Jospin constructs a mirrored forest in “Ici” (2025), inspired by the classical Huang Gongwang painting “Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains” (1348–50). With “Skeleton” (2025), P. Staff turns the gallery into an exploration of control and resistance, layering infrared imagery and poetic narration to examine how bodies are regulated and liberated.\nLi-chen Loh, Director of the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, remarks: “Since its inception, the Taipei Biennial has embraced diversity of voices. This edition reflects on the ties between local experience and global context, inviting visitors to reconsider their place in an interconnected world.”\nFor more information, visit taipeibiennial.org/2025 or follow TFAM’s Facebook and Instagram.\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

The exhibition is curated by Nicolas Bourriaud, who coined the term “relational aesthetics.”\nThe artists cited a collaboration between MAXXI and Eni, an Italian company, on a series of artworks on view at the company’s complex in Rome. The energy firm has reportedly received an Israeli offshore oil exploration license, which the artist’s letter claims allows it to drill in the waters off the coast of Gaza.\nMAXXI has not responded to Hyperallergic’s inquiries, and it is unclear whether the artists’ works have been removed from the show. Hyperallergic has attempted to contact all of the artist signatories as well as the exhibition’s curator for comment.\nLast month, protesters targeted Eni’s oil-exporting vessels in Taranto, Italy, which were believed to be intended for Israel. The letter also names and accuses MAXXI of having “a history of partnerships” with Leonardo S.p.A., a European arms manufacturer; its foundation for culture Med-Or; the geospacial information company e-GEOS; and satellite company Telespazio. The letter did not specify what collaborations the museum had undertaken with the companies.\nThe artists said collaborations with the named entities are part of a “broader and persistent pattern of institutional choices which reveal the museum’s role in legitimizing zionist propaganda and narratives that enable the systematic erasure of Palestinian culture, history, and life.”\nIn a separate letter published in the same Nero article, the Palestine activist groups Galassia Antisionista, Vogliamo Tutt’Altro, BDS Roma, Il Campo Innocente, and ANGA stated their intent to “expose the complicity of art institutions with the military industrial complex.” \nThe groups have been boycotting cultural institutions, including MAXXI, in solidarity with Palestine, the letter said.\n“This decision underscores our conviction that, as artists, we must take responsibility for the injustices our work might otherwise be used to justify, legitimize, and art-wash,” the artists wrote.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVincent van Gogh, “Olive Picking” (1889) (public domain via Wikimedia Commons)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\nA lawsuit claims that the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a Greek foundation should not have acquired a Vincent van Gogh oil painting stolen by the Nazis, and should return the work to the relatives of its rightful owners.\nThe heirs to a German-Jewish family say they were forced to abandon van Gogh’s 1889 painting “Olive Picking” in Munich when they fled Nazi rule and are suing The Met and the Basil and Elise Goulandris Foundation for allegedly purchasing the work without fully researching its provenance.\n“In the decades since the end of World War II, this Nazi-looted painting has been repeatedly and secretly trafficked, purchased and sold in and through New York,” reads the complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court by Judith Anne Silver, administrator of the Estate of Hedwig E. Stern. The heirs are seeking the restitution of the painting or its equivalence in value as well as damages over $75,000.\nIn a statement to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for The Met said the institution believes the work entered its collection and was sold “legally and well within all guidelines and policies,” but welcomed any new information about the piece.\nThe painting’s controversial provenance remains in dispute.  \nThe Dutch Post-Impressionist artist created the work, which depicts three women using a ladder to pluck olives from a grove, a year before he died. Fritz and Hedwig Stern purchased the painting in 1935, but the Nazi government declared it “German cultural property” and prevented them from bringing it with them when they fled with their six children to California the following year, the suit said.\nInstead, the Nazis appointed a “trustee” to sell the painting in 1938, put the funds in a blocked account, and later confiscated the money, the suit claimed. The painting made its way to Tübingen, then part of the French Zone, and eventually New York by way of dealer Justin Thannhauser, who had played a role in the sale of the work in Berlin and sought the approval of the French government to have it sent to him. (Although Thannhauser, who was Jewish, was also forced to flee Germany, he is “now widely known to have trafficked in art that was looted from or sold under duress by Jewish families,” the suit states.)\nAround 1948, Thannhauser sold the work to the wealthy businessman Vincent Astor, allegedly without disclosing its connection to the Sterns. \nBy 1955, Astor’s wife, the philanthropist Brooke Astor, consigned the painting to the Knoedler Gallery, which sold it to the Met the following year for $125,000. Museum curator Theodore Rousseau, Jr. approved the purchase but failed to realize that the Nazis had taken the painting despite serving as an officer on the Art Looting Investigation Unit in the Office of Strategic Services during the war, the suit claims.\n“Rousseau and the Met knew or should have known that the painting had probably been looted by Nazis,” the suit said.\nIn 1972, the museum sold the work via Marlborough Gallery to the Greek shipping magnate Basil Goulandris and his wife Elise. It is currently on display in an Athens museum run by the Greek couple’s foundation, which does not mention the Stern family’s role in its ownership. The lawsuit further accuses the Gouladris family and its entities of deliberately concealing the painting’s provenance via a series of transfers.\nHyperallergic has contacted the Goulandris Foundation for comment.\nThe lawsuit questions the Met’s reasons for deaccessioning the work, alleging that “it was concerned that another institution would report the painting as looted.”\nAs for The Met, museum officials say that the painting met the museum’s “strict criteria for deaccessioning” since it was determined to be of lesser importance than other van Gogh works in its collection. They added that the museum published the artwork’s known ownership history in a 1967 catalogue of French paintings in the collection.\n“At no time during The Met’s ownership of the painting was there any record that it had once belonged to the Stern family — indeed, that information did not become available until several decades after the painting left the Museum’s collection,” the Met spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe artwork’s provenance and The Met’s intentions will soon be debated in Manhattan federal court, a forum where pilfered artworks and antiquities have frequently been re-examined and expatriated (the Stern heirs pursued litigation to return the painting in California in 2022, but the suit was dismissed for jurisdiction reasons).\nThe Met established a new position last year responsible for researching the provenance of 1.5 million works in its collection. Dozens of works of art and artifacts have been seized by the Manhattan district attorney’s office since 2017 over concerns about their acquisition. The museum now has a team of 11 analysts.\n“The Metropolitan Museum of Art takes seriously its longstanding commitment to address Nazi-era claims and has a long and well documented history of leading research initiatives and seeking resolution for any object that has been identified as illegally appropriated without subsequent restitution,” a Met spokeswoman said.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAaron Short is a Brooklyn-based journalist covering politics, criminal justice, real estate, the environment, and the arts.

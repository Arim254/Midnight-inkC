    "body": "\n\tin Audio Books, Literature |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHav­ing not revis­it­ed The Hob­bit in some time, I’ve felt the famil­iar pull—shared by many readers—to return to Tolkien’s fairy-tale nov­el itself. It was my first expo­sure to Tolkien, and the per­fect book for a young read­er ready to dive into moral com­plex­i­ty and a ful­ly-real­ized fic­tion­al world.\nAnd what bet­ter guide could there be through The Hob­bit than Tolkien him­self, read­ing (above) from the 1937 work? In this 1952 record­ing in two parts (part 2 is below), the ven­er­a­ble fan­ta­sist and schol­ar reads from his own work for the first time on tape.\nTolkien begins with a pas­sage that first describes the crea­ture Gol­lum; lis­ten­ing to this descrip­tion again, I am struck by how much dif­fer­ent­ly I imag­ined him when I first read the book. The Gol­lum of The Hob­bit seems some­how hoari­er and more mon­strous than many lat­er visu­al inter­pre­ta­tions. This is a minor point and not a crit­i­cism, but per­haps a com­ment on how nec­es­sary it is to return to the source of a myth­ic world as rich as Tolkien’s, even, or espe­cial­ly, when it’s been so well-real­ized in oth­er media. No one, after all, knows Mid­dle Earth bet­ter than its cre­ator.\n\n\n\t\n\nThese read­ings were part of a much longer record­ing ses­sion, dur­ing which Tolkien also read (and sang!) exten­sive­ly from The Lord of the Rings. A YouTube user has col­lect­ed, in sev­er­al parts, a radio broad­cast of that full ses­sion, and it’s cer­tain­ly worth your time to lis­ten to it all the way through. It’s also worth know­ing the neat con­text of the record­ing. Here’s the text that accom­pa­nies the video on YouTube:\nWhen Tolkien vis­it­ed a friend in August of 1952 to retrieve a man­u­script of The Lord of the Rings, he was shown a “tape recorder”. Hav­ing nev­er seen one before, he asked how it worked and was then delight­ed to have his voice record­ed and hear him­self played back for the first time. His friend then asked him to read from The Hob­bit, and Tolkien did so in this one incred­i­ble take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2012.\nRelat­ed Con­tent\nLis­ten to J.R.R.

    "body": "\n\tin Life, Philosophy |   \tJanuary 5th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nEach cul­ture has its own say­ings about the unique­ness and tran­sience of the present moment. In recent years, the Eng­lish-speak­ers have often found them­selves remind­ed, through the expres­sion “YOLO,” that they only live once. (The ques­tion of whether that should real­ly be “YLOO,” or “You Live Only Once,” we put aside for the time being.) In Japan, unsur­pris­ing­ly, one some­times hears a much more ven­er­a­ble equiv­a­lent: “ichi-go ichi‑e,” which some read­ers acquaint­ed with the Japan­ese lan­guage should be assured has noth­ing to do with straw­ber­ries, ichi­go. Rather, the say­ing’s under­ly­ing Chi­nese char­ac­ters (一期一会) can be trans­lat­ed as “one time, one meet­ing.”\nThe Bud­dhis­ti­cal­ly inflect­ed “ichi-go ichi‑e” is just one in the vast library of yoji­juku­go, high­ly con­densed apho­ris­tic expres­sions writ­ten with just four char­ac­ters. (Oth­er coun­tries with Chi­nese-influ­enced lan­guages have their ver­sions, includ­ing sajaseon­geo in Korea and chéngyǔ in Chi­na itself.) It descends, as the sto­ry goes, from a slight­ly longer say­ing favored by the six­teenth-cen­tu­ry tea mas­ter Sen no Rikyū, “ichi-go ni ichi-do” (一期に一度).\nOne must pay respects to the host of a tea cer­e­mo­ny because the meet­ing would only ever occur once — which, of course, it would, even if the cer­e­mo­ny was a reg­u­lar­ly sched­uled event. For we nev­er, to bor­row an ancient Greek take on this whole sub­ject, step into the same riv­er twice; no two events, sep­a­rat­ed in time, can ever tru­ly be iden­ti­cal.\n\n\n\t\n\nOne impli­ca­tion, as not­ed in the explana­to­ry videos above from the BBC and Einzel­gänger, is that we should savor what­ev­er moment we hap­pen to find our­selves in, how­ev­er imper­fect, because we won’t get a sec­ond chance to do so. And if it offers lit­tle or noth­ing to enjoy, we can find solace in the fact that its par­tic­u­lar dis­plea­sure, too, can nev­er revis­it us. With the past gone and the future nev­er guar­an­teed, the present moment, in any case, is the only time that actu­al­ly exists for us, so we’d bet­ter make our­selves com­fort­able with­in it. Though these ideas have per­haps found their most ele­gant and mem­o­rable expres­sion in Japan, they’re hard­ly con­sid­ered exclu­sive cul­tur­al prop­er­ty there.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nTopped with a roof shaped like a crabshell, Le Corbusier’s Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut is a sanctuary amid the French mountainside. The 1955 construction rests atop a hill in Ronchamp, standing unobstructed by the otherwise forested inclines. As the sun rises and falls, light filters in through the mélange of rectangular windows tinted to cast streams of color around the space.\nThe stained glass apertures of Le Corbusier’s modernist chapel are a clear reference point for Luftwerk’s “Open Frame.” The site-specific work fills a cavernous corner of Secrist | Beach with a collection of rectangular aluminum panels painted with acrylic and, most notably, fluorescent. Where the pioneering architect sought a natural backlight in the sun, Luftwerk relies on the properties of the paint to achieve a luminous glow. The only external source is a handful of strategically placed LED spotlights that bathe the entire installation in purple when in use.\nDetail of “Open Frame”\n“Open Frame” is one of the many pieces in the artists’ latest exhibition that extends their unyielding interest in light and color. The Sun Standing Still features a collection of sculptures and installations that harness the principles of color theory, explore space, and elicit various sensory experiences. The artists, Chicago-based Petra Bachmaier and Sean Gallero (previously), draw on the characteristics of sunlight as it broaches the horizon, cultivating a body of work that conjures luminosity through negative space and pigment.\nLong interested in perspective, Luftwerk presents several works that appear dramatically different depending on the viewer’s position. The Solargraph series, for example, references the long-duration images that capture the sun’s path between solstices. Stretching across the gallery, these works incorporate skinny, aluminum strips painted white on one side and bisected by various hues on the inverse. As the viewer moves, so does the perception of the piece, revealing an expanse of faintly tinted white before shifting to a bright arc of color.\nRelatedly, the freestanding Aperture of Twilight sculptures place five panels cut with differently sized openings eight inches apart. Painted on one side, the layers form a sort of portal or entrance, inviting a closer look. The circular Aurae Quartet pieces function similarly as they utilize concentric rings to capture a sense of movement inward or out.\nIf you’re in Chicago, you can see The Sun Standing Still through February 28.

    "body": "\n\tThe British Museum is on the hunt for hundreds of stolen artifacts, and it plans to hire a specialist to help track them down before they vanish for good.\n\n\tIn 2023, the museum revealed that thousands of items had gone missing from its Greek and Roman collections. Tom Harrison, who was recently promoted to lead the department, has been leading the painstaking recovery of the treasures spanning gold jewelry, semiprecious stones, and glass dating back to the 15th century BCE. Harrison told the Times of London that he hopes to reclaim the gold before it’s melted down, acknowledging that the search will likely continue “until I’m retired or under the ground.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tCurrently, a small team of five, already stretched with other museum duties, is tasked with the recovery. Harrison plans to recruit someone dedicated to “writing letters to dealers, auction houses, and collectors worldwide” once funding is secured. “We want to make progress fast,” he said.A museum spokesperson told ARTnews that the new role, which has not yet been advertised, will involve a good deal of archival research.\n\n\tThe scandal erupted when former curator Peter Higgs was sacked amid allegations of stealing, selling, and melting down artefacts over more than a decade. He denies the charges amid an ongoing civil case against him. The museum has so far recovered 654 of an estimated 1,500 missing items.\n\n\tRecovery is painstaking. Leads have been coming in from the public, but the team’s own research has mostly focused on private sales, catalogs, and historical archives. Harrison noted that the quality of tips “varies enormously,” and increasingly the returns are modest, often one or two objects at a time, though there are occasional windfalls, like one involving 268 gems shipped from the US.\n\n\tTechnology is playing a growing role in the search. Open-source investigations and AI-assisted image matching have helped track long-lost artifacts, while the museum ordered a full audit of the Greek and Roman collections to ensure that nothing else goes missing.Despite bureaucratic hurdles and the long wait for export licenses, each recovered object has sparked flurries of joy, Harrison said. He recalled a moment of exhilaration when an item which has been sold multiple times, even on eBay, since it went missing finally returns: “It’s good… a sense of real satisfaction, like bringing them home.”\n\n\tWins like that ensure that the team remains optimistic, especially for the gold. “It’s always assumed gold is stolen to be melted down. That is depressing, but there are little glimmers of hope we might find more of it,” Harrison said.\n",

When the Nixon administration sought to deport Lennon in the 1970s, Wildes’s father successfully argued that he qualified as an “outstanding person in the arts,” a case that later helped inspire the creation of the O-1B visa under the 1990 Immigration Act. Decades on, the O-1B, intended for artists of exceptional ability, is undergoing a transformation. The Financial Times reported that since the pandemic, immigration attorneys say applications have surged, driven largely by social media influencers and Only Fans models. High follower counts, brand partnerships, and digital earnings are increasingly used to demonstrate “commercial success,” one of the visa’s key criteria. Supporters argue these metrics offer clear evidence of distinction in a crowded field. Critics, however, worry that reliance on algorithmic popularity risks diluting the visa’s original purpose, replacing artistic merit with measurable attention, and reshaping how creative excellence is defined in US immigration law.INDIANA JONES WANTED. The British Museum is preparing to hire a specialist to help recover hundreds of stolen artifacts before they vanish permanently, the Times wrote. In 2023, the museum revealed that thousands of items were missing from its Greek and Roman collections. Professor Tom Harrison, who was newly appointed head of the department, has been leading efforts to retrieve the treasures, which include gold jewellery, semi-precious stones, and glass dating back to the 15th century BC. He hopes to recover the gold items before they are melted down but expects the hunt to continue “until I am retired or under the ground.” Once the budget is secured, Harrison plans to recruit someone to focus on contacting dealers, auction houses, and collectors worldwide. Currently, the mission relies on a small team of five, who also manage other duties. So far, 654 of an estimated 1,500 missing items have been recovered, while a criminal investigation and civil case against former curator Peter Higgs continue.The DigestBritish museums have been concealing certain African artifacts that, according to tribal rules, should not be viewed by women. [The Telegraph]\n\n\tTurkey announced that its Seddülbahir Fortress has been nominated for the 2026 European Museum of the Year Award. [Daily Sabah]\n\t\n\tThe 151-year-old Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum in Scotland is facing a precarious financial crisis revealed by a consultancy review, prompting a £360,000 council bailout. [The Courier]\n\t\n\tScientists have said that a seven-million-year-old fossil suggests our ancestors walked upright far earlier than previously believed, potentially reshaping the story of human origins. [Science Daily]The Kicker\n\tMEGA-MUSEUMS FAR FROM EXTINCT. Frank Gehry’s death last month seemed to toll the bell for the age of the blockbuster museum, the FT (again) wrote. The architect whose Guggenheim Bilbao taught struggling cities to believe salvation lay in a single, flamboyant cultural object has gone; his long-delayed Guggenheim Abu Dhabi is still being built, “set perhaps to be a bookend for that era,” the FT added. “By the time it is completed (this year, apparently, though that has been said before), it will be a fossil, a dinosaur from another age.” However, the mega-museum is far from extinct; this year Los Angeles will open two major new art museums. The most prominent project is Peter Zumthor’s extension to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), estimated to cost $720 million. Mega-museums are also opening in Europe in 2026. Take the KANAL-Centre Pompidou in Brussels, housed in a 1930s Citroën garage. And don’t forget Russia; Zilart, a huge private contemporary art museum in Moscow conceived to show the collection of its founders, Andrey and Yelizaveta Molchanov, opened last month.",

    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tNovember 28th, 2025  4 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs hard as it may be to believe, some of us have nev­er seen a movie belong­ing to the Mar­vel Cin­e­mat­ic Uni­verse. If you’re one of those unini­ti­at­ed, none of the count­less clips incor­po­rat­ed into the Like Sto­ries of Old video essay above will tempt you to get ini­ti­at­ed. Nor will the laments aired by host Tom van der Lin­den, who, despite once enjoy­ing the MCU him­self, even­tu­al­ly came to won­der why keep­ing up with its releas­es had begun to feel less like a thrill than a chore. As if their CGI-laden sound and fury weren’t try­ing enough, there’s also “the con­stant quip­ping, the annoy­ing self-aware­ness, the fact that every­thing has to be a fran­chise now.”\nVan der Lin­den labels a cen­tral fac­tor in the decline of the MCU “sto­ry­telling entropy.” Clas­sic films, you may have noticed, con­cen­trate prac­ti­cal­ly all the ener­gy in every facet of their pro­duc­tion toward the expres­sion of spe­cif­ic themes, sto­ries, and char­ac­ters; at their best, their every line, ges­ture, cut, and inven­tion rep­re­sents the tip of an artis­tic ice­berg. Take, to use a pop­u­lar exam­ple, the lightsaber intro­duced in Star Wars, which Van der Lin­den calls “not just a weapon, but a metaphor” that “sym­bol­i­cal­ly com­mu­ni­cates a lot about the phi­los­o­phy of its wield­er, and about the larg­er world that it exists in,” con­dens­ing “a mul­ti­tude of mean­ings and ideas into a sim­ple, sin­gu­lar object.”\nIt does so in the first two or three movies, at any rate. In the decades since, as the Star Wars uni­verse has grown ever vaster, more com­plex, and con­cep­tu­al­ly unwieldy, so the pro­lif­er­a­tion and mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the once-mar­velous lightsaber has turned it into some­thing mun­dane, even banal. So it goes with sto­ry­telling entropy, a phe­nom­e­non that afflicts every nar­ra­tive fran­chise com­mer­cial­ly com­pelled to grow with­out end. That process of expan­sion even­tu­al­ly turns even the most cap­ti­vat­ing orig­i­nal mate­ri­als dif­fuse and unin­volv­ing to all but the hard­est-core fans — by which point it has usu­al­ly become obvi­ous that cre­ators them­selves have long since lost their own pas­sion for the sto­ries.\nMost MCU view­ers will admit that it has pro­duced miss­es as well as hits. But Mar­veliza­tion, as Van der Lin­den calls it, has also inspired oth­er, imi­ta­tive cor­po­rate fran­chis­es to pump out glob­al­ly mar­ketable con­tent fierce­ly pro­tect­ed by intel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty lawyers — and has even drained the inter­est out of realms of film and tele­vi­sion that have noth­ing to do with super­heroes, swords, or sci-fi. Hol­ly­wood has always been about the bot­tom line, of course, but only in recent decades have mar­ket sat­u­ra­tion, cross-plat­form strat­e­gy, and max­i­mum crossover poten­tial come to dom­i­nate its pri­or­i­ties so com­plete­ly. From the MCU or oth­er­wise, a Mar­velized movie is one that, at bot­tom, has no press­ing need to be made — and that we, ulti­mate­ly, feel no press­ing need to see.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Real Any­more: A Close Look at Chang­ing Film­mak­ing Tech­niques\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tNovember 27th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAlice’s Restau­rant. It’s now a Thanks­giv­ing clas­sic, and some­thing of a tra­di­tion around here. Record­ed in 1967, the 18+ minute coun­ter­cul­ture song recounts Arlo Guthrie’s real encounter with the law, start­ing on Thanks­giv­ing Day 1965. As the long song unfolds, we hear all about how a hip­pie-bat­ing police offi­cer, by the name of William “Obie” Oban­hein, arrest­ed Arlo for lit­ter­ing. (Cul­tur­al foot­note: Obie pre­vi­ous­ly posed for sev­er­al Nor­man Rock­well paint­ings, includ­ing the well-known paint­ing, “The Run­away,” that graced a 1958 cov­er of The Sat­ur­day Evening Post.) In fair­ly short order, Arlo pleads guilty to a mis­de­meanor charge, pays a $25 fine, and cleans up the thrash. But the sto­ry isn’t over. Not by a long shot.\nLat­er, when Arlo (son of Woody Guthrie) gets called up for the draft, the pet­ty crime iron­i­cal­ly becomes a basis for dis­qual­i­fy­ing him from mil­i­tary ser­vice in the Viet­nam War. Guthrie recounts this with some bit­ter­ness as the song builds into a satir­i­cal protest against the war: “I’m sit­tin’ here on the Group W bench ’cause you want to know if I’m moral enough to join the Army, burn women, kids, hous­es and vil­lages after bein’ a lit­ter­bug.” And then we’re back to the cheery cho­rus again: “You can get any­thing you want, at Alice’s Restau­rant.”\nWe have fea­tured Guthrie’s clas­sic dur­ing past years.

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“I’ve always been fascinated by the idea that our perceived reality is shaped by our minds and reflecting our inner world,” says artist Michelle Blancke, whose ethereal photographs of trees, glens, and foliage invite us into a familiar yet uncanny world. Her lens-based practice explores themes of interdependence, consciousness, and concealment, especially through the subject of nature.\nBlancke’s vivid Secret Garden series comprises a total of five sub-categories: Realm, Ascent, Essence, Veins, and Origin. Whether capturing the waxy surface of an intricately veined leaf or the way vines create shadowy veils over gnarled trees, she’s interested in relationships between “transformation, mysticism, and the thin veil between the seen and the unseen,” she says. “When I enter woodland, it feels like stepping into a parallel space where something hidden becomes perceptible.”\n\nMuch of Blancke’s process involves walking—moving through forested areas until a certain atmosphere or interaction with sunlight resonates with her. “When I photograph, I’m responding to that feeling rather than to the literal scene in front of me,” she says. \nIt’s during digital post-production that Blancke begins to make more deliberate choices, shifting hues “to amplify the emotional tone I sensed in the moment,” she says. “The colours are a way of revealing an inner layer that already felt present while I was standing there. It’s an attempt to make the invisible atmosphere visible.”\nBlancke’s work is on view through January 25 as part of the 2025 Aesthetica Art Prize exhibition at York Art Gallery. She also works closely with BBA Gallery. Explore more on the artist’s website and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 2024, while Timo Fahler was out for a run in Los Angeles, he came across a discarded bedspring. It lingered in his studio for months until one day, its thirteen rows of springs revealed themselves as the red and white stripes of the American flag. It also turned out to be the last work he made in the U.S. before he and his family relocated to The Netherlands.\nFahler’s slouched “flag” is one of a number of recent stained glass sculptures on view in his solo exhibition Terminal Classic at Sebastian Gladstone that reference major changes in the artist’s personal life and the U.S.’s tumultuous socio-political climate. Time becomes slippery as he taps into imagery that is both contemporary and ancient.\n“flag” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 73 x 50 x 8 inches\nFahler often incorporates vibrant Mesoamerican motifs like skulls, serpents, and glyphs derived from Mayan codices. Through the likenesses of Mayan gods and imagery derived from ancient tombs, he explores dualities of past and present, ecological precarity, socio-economic and political divides, and the distances between people and places. Juxtaposed with centuries-old, non-Western motifs, Fahler also delves into deeply symbolic American iconography, like the Stars and Stripes and the bald eagle.\nThe latter, of course, is also a profound symbol in many Indigenous American cultures, emblematic of courage and wisdom. And despite the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental protections, the creature is also a stark reminder of the importance of conservation efforts. After dangerous pesticides reduced the total number of breeding pairs of bald eagles to only a little more than 400 in the 1960s, years of work by ecologists and a government-mandated ban on DDT finally allowed populations to rebound.\nThe White House is also an apt symbol for clashes of ideals, as the more than 230-year-old building represents American democracy and liberty while also being a place of contradictions. Enslaved people worked alongside other laborers to build it—information that has now been entirely omitted from histories touted by the Trump administration. The current president is also frequently condemned for his authoritarian leanings and his disregard for the country’s democratic foundations.\nIn Fahler’s piece “Idyllic, Idealic, Idea lick, i’d eel lick, i deal ick,” the structure is viewed through its Pennsylvania Avenue fence. Flattened like a stage backdrop, the White House seems to fade into the background as our attention is continually drawn to its cage-like barrier. The building sits, in a sense, within a prison of its own making.\n“Idyllic, Idealic, Idea lick, i’d eel lick, i deal ick” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 30.5 x 62 x 6 inches\n“Fences, gates, and beds all hold us in different ways—on our land, in our homes, in our sleep,” the gallery says. Fahler repeats the motif over and over, often using gates, chainlink, and window security grates to emphasize the contrast between inside and outside; confinement and freedom.\nTerminal Classic continues through December 13 in New York City. Find more on Fahler’s website and Instagram.\n“topos haliaeetus” (2022-23), steel, stained glass, lead, aluminum, cast-iron, and 52 caliber blank bullets, 26 x 41 x 3 inches\n“SKYBEARER” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 62 x 42 x 4 inches\nDetail of “flag”\n“BEWARE OF DOG (it’s just not that simple anymore)” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 50.75 x 47.25 x 6.25 inches\nDetail of “AH MUZEN CAB (the diving Bee god)”\n“It’s always been this way” (2025), steel, stained glass, lead, and found object, 32 x 23.5 x 6 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThrough large-scale tapestries of fringed strips of fabric, Abdoulaye Konaté explores the contemporary relevance of ancient signs and symbols. The Malian artist began working with textiles in the 1990s, when it became clear to him how prevalent they are in our everyday lives, from clothing and home goods to tools and more. This early interest began what’s become a research-driven artistic practice, and today, he layers long, stitched pieces of Bazin and Kente fabrics into dynamic, largely abstract works.\nKonaté and his team create each monumental tapestry entirely by hand, from the dyeing process to cutting and stitching. The final layout typically occurs on the studio floor after the artist sketches in marker and digitally refines this preliminary drawing to determine the exact composition.\n“Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo” (2024), textile, 264.5 × 524 centimeters\nMost works incorporate gradients that begin with lighter colors on the bottom before reaching deep navys, reds, and blacks up top. Patterns and various motifs often emerge from the gathered strips as a way to invoke the artist’s broad research interests from “Malian craftsmanship, Tibetan art, Tunisian ceramics, Berber textiles, etc,” says a statement from Templon.\n“Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo,” for example, features a geometric mark derived from the Manding people of West Africa. “I took this symbol and deconstructed it, breaking it down into a central element, and then I tried to rework it from both sides,” the artist shares in a video interview. This enormous piece—which stretches upwards of 17 feet long—also features small Kalao birds, which, for the Bambara tribe, represent wisdom and protection. They’re also thought to facilitate communication between our realm and the spiritual.\nDespite his commitment to textiles, the artist likens his work to painting and the ways it allows for self-expression. “The material changes, but I think of it as painting,” he adds.\nIf you’re in Paris, you can see Konaté’s most recent exhibition, Le tissu du réel, or The fabric of reality, on view at Templon through December 31.\n“Composition bleue avec losanges – motif Tibet” (2023), textile (Bazin and Kente), 242 × 224 centimeters\nDetail of “Motif du Mandé et Calao Sénoufo” (2024), textile, 264.5 × 524 centimeters\nDetail of “Losange et triangle (bazin et kente) – ocre” (2024), textile, 266 × 397 centimeters\n“Bleu et vert aux carrés” (2024), textile, 211 × 150 centimeters\n“Vert Touareg (motif 2)” (2023), textile, 194 × 157 centimeters\nInstallation view of Photo by Tanguy Beurdeley\nInstallation view\n\t\n\t\n\t",

(photo by Ricardo DeAratanha, courtesy Los Angeles Times)\n    \n        \n            Art critic Christopher Knight will retire from the Los Angeles Times on Friday, November 28, fellow staff member Jessica Gelt announced in a newsletter last week. As the paper's staff art critic, Knight published exhibition reviews and commentary on the city's arts institutions, writing for the publication for 36 years. In 2020, he won a Pulitzer Prize in criticism for his work evaluating the changes at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as the institution prepared for its forthcoming expansion, demonstrating “extraordinary community service by a critic.” Knight was previously named a finalist for the prize three times, in 1991, 2001, and 2007, and won the Dorothea and Leo Rabkin Foundation’s lifetime achievement award. His last column for the Los Angeles Times will run on December 1. “I'll keep writing, but after 45 years the daily journalism thing is done,” Knight told Hyperallergic in an email. “It has been a privilege, and it has been fun (mostly). Bless the readers!”Describing his career in art criticism as an “accident” in a podcast interview with Hyperallergic co-founder Hrag Vartanian in 2020, Knight got his start in the 1970s working as a curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, and later became a consultant for the Smithsonian Institution in Los Angeles and the Lannan Foundation. His first journalism job was at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.“One of the things I learned in art museums is that there are two audiences to be served,” Knight told Vartanian. “If you serve only the general public, the art public will abandon you. If you serve only the art public, the general public won't bother with you, because there are many other things for them to do. So I began to apply that to newspapers, which are pretty much the same thing.”In her note to staff, Gelt, a staff writer at the LA Times, described Knight as “everything a truly excellent critic should be.”\"It’s impossible to overstate the loss Knight’s departure represents for the paper and Los Angeles, or what a tireless, generous, inspiring colleague he is,” Gelt wrote.Christopher Knight on the Hyperallergic Podcast:Christopher Knight: The Critic Whose Love for LA Uplifted Its Arts CommunityThe veteran art critic has played a formidable role in helping to shape the world’s perception of contemporary art in Los Angeles.HyperallergicHrag Vartanian\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Art Criticism\n                      \n                      \n                        Christopher Knight\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

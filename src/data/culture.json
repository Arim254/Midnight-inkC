The exhibition is curated by Nicolas Bourriaud, who coined the term “relational aesthetics.”\nThe artists cited a collaboration between MAXXI and Eni, an Italian company, on a series of artworks on view at the company’s complex in Rome. The energy firm has reportedly received an Israeli offshore oil exploration license, which the artist’s letter claims allows it to drill in the waters off the coast of Gaza.\nMAXXI has not responded to Hyperallergic’s inquiries, and it is unclear whether the artists’ works have been removed from the show. Hyperallergic has attempted to contact all of the artist signatories as well as the exhibition’s curator for comment.\nLast month, protesters targeted Eni’s oil-exporting vessels in Taranto, Italy, which were believed to be intended for Israel. The letter also names and accuses MAXXI of having “a history of partnerships” with Leonardo S.p.A., a European arms manufacturer; its foundation for culture Med-Or; the geospacial information company e-GEOS; and satellite company Telespazio. The letter did not specify what collaborations the museum had undertaken with the companies.\nThe artists said collaborations with the named entities are part of a “broader and persistent pattern of institutional choices which reveal the museum’s role in legitimizing zionist propaganda and narratives that enable the systematic erasure of Palestinian culture, history, and life.”\nIn a separate letter published in the same Nero article, the Palestine activist groups Galassia Antisionista, Vogliamo Tutt’Altro, BDS Roma, Il Campo Innocente, and ANGA stated their intent to “expose the complicity of art institutions with the military industrial complex.” \nThe groups have been boycotting cultural institutions, including MAXXI, in solidarity with Palestine, the letter said.\n“This decision underscores our conviction that, as artists, we must take responsibility for the injustices our work might otherwise be used to justify, legitimize, and art-wash,” the artists wrote.\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAllison Knowles at home in New York in 2014 (photo by and courtesy Jason Bergman for Lucky Peach)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nAlison Knowles, a powerhouse in postwar experimental art and a cofounder of the Fluxus movement, passed away at her home in New York City on October 29 at age 92. Her death was confirmed by James Fuentes gallery, which represented her. \nKnowles worked not only between disciplines but between media, seemingly exploding the boundaries of every form she inhabited. Over a six-decade career, she was a pioneer in process-based art, relational aesthetics, computer-based art, and more, incorporating both chance and sound while drawing upon the political resonances of everyday objects. She rejected not only the boundaries of the art world, but also the borders between art object and outside world. “People don’t touch art,” she said in a 2010 oral history with the Archives of American Art. “That’s one of the problems.” Indeed, as critic Sally Deskins wrote in Hyperallergic in 2016, “Knowles asks us to physically experience the now.”\nAlison Knowles, “Music by Alison,” performed during Fully Guaranteed 12 Fluxus Concerts, New York on May 23, 1964, gelatin silver print (© Alison Knowles; photo courtesy Hannah Higgins)\nKnowles was born in the Westchester suburb of Scarsdale, New York, in 1933. She attended Middlebury College in Vermont before transferring to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, studying under painter Richard Lindner and abstract expressionist Adolph Gottlieb, as well as Color Field pioneer Josef Albers during a summer course at Syracuse University. \nIn New York in the 1950s, she found herself dabbling in all arenas of contemporary and experimental art. She both attended and performed in Allan Kaprow’s “Happenings.” She joined the New York Mycological Society, where she met luminaries like composer John Cage and artist, historian, and organizer George Maciunas. Along with those two, she was a founding member of the Fluxus movement, participating in its first performance in 1962 alongside artists like Nam June Paik as the only woman in the group. \nNewspaper clipping depicting Alison Knowles performing “The Big Book” (1967) (photo courtesy Hannah Higgins)\nKnowles married fellow Fluxus artist Dick Higgins in 1960, with whom she had twin daughters Hannah and Jessica, described in a 2002 interview as “my sisters as well as my children.” In 1963, the pair founded Something Else Press, which published intermedia book art meant to be broadly accessible. There, she would design and co-edit John Cage’s Notations (1969), a book of music manuscripts. (She and Higgins divorced in 1970.)\nAlison Knowles (center) performing “Make a salad” at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, on October 24, 1962 (photo courtesy Hannah Higgins)\nShe continued to experiment with the form in individual works, such as large-scale installations like “The Boat Book” (1979), in which “readers” could walk through pages, and works like “Bean Rolls” (1963) — a favored material for their affordability and universality — which reconstituted everyday items into books. She turned pages into instruments and worked with master papermaker Coco Gordon to create a book in which sections correspond to parts of the body (Loose Pages, 1983).\nKnowles took up Event Scores, the participatory performance form devised by George Brecht, and would go on to produce more than 100 of these works. Among her most iconic are “Make a Salad” (1962), “The Identical Lunch” (1960), and “Newspaper Music” (1962). The first, originally conceived at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, consists only of its title directive, leaning on performers to interpret and enact it. \n“It was our own way of scoring our actions or performances in a manner as serious as a score by Satie,” she told the New York Times in 2022. “A sentence like ‘Make a salad,’ that’s the event score.”\nAlison Knowles, “The House of Dust” (1967/2021) (photo by Wolfgang Günzel via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nShe was also credited for co-creating what is now considered one of the world’s first computer-generated poems with composer James Tenney. “The House of Dust” (1967), made in an early programming language on an IBM computer, will be restaged as part of the New Museum’s inaugural exhibition for its reopening.\nHer work is held in major collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Tate Modern in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.\nKnowles will be remembered for her radical interventions in form, her emphasis on the poetry in the physical world, and her insistence on art as a lived form. As the artist put it in a 2011 interview, art, for her, “was about having an excuse to get to talk to people, to notice everything that happened, to pay attention.”\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tFollowing a theft at the Oakland Museum of California‘s (OMCA) off-site storage facility earlier this month, the museum released a statement on Friday afternoon.\n\n\tOn October 15, around 3:30 a.m., a thief or group of thieves broke into the museum’s off-site storage facility, taking more than 1,000 objects. A number of additional details surrounding the case were initially withheld, so as not to impact the Oakland Police Department and the FBI’s Art Crime Team’s ongoing investigation. Now, with their approval, the museum has issued a statement on the events.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“Based on current findings, investigators believe this was a crime of opportunity, not a targeted theft,” OCMA’s statement reads. “There is no indication that the perpetrators specifically identified the facility as museum storage or sought particular artworks or artifacts. Instead, it appears they gained access and took items that were most easily available.”\n\n\tThe museum confirmed that the burglars took off with six Native American baskets, several 19th-century scrimshaw objects, a number of daguerreotypes, modernist metalwork jewelry pieces, and historic memorabilia such as political pins, award ribbons, and souvenir tokens.\n\n\tOf particular concern are the stolen Native American baskets. The connected tribe has asked that their name not be public and that the museum not release any additional details about the baskets.\n\n\t“This is a loss not only for OMCA, but for the broader community,” said Lori Fogarty, executive director and CEO of OMCA, in a statement. “The Museum takes its responsibility to steward California’s history and cultural legacy with the utmost seriousness and remains committed to recovering the stolen items and ensuring their continued care for future generations.”\n\n\tThe 100,000-square-foot warehouse holds more than 2 million historical artifacts, many of which have been donated to the OMCA.\n\n\tAnyone with information on the theft should contact the Oakland Police Department’s burglary section (at 510-238-3951) or the FBI Art Crime Team (at tips.fbi.gov or 1-800-CALL-FBI).\n",

    "description": "\n\tThe Princeton University Art Museum (PUAM) reopened its doors to the public Friday, after an almost six-year hiatus. Its previous home, last updated",
    "body": "\n\tThe Princeton University Art Museum (PUAM) reopened its doors to the public Friday, after an almost six-year hiatus. Its previous home, last updated in 1969, was demolished in 2021 to make room for a new 146,000-square-foot complex, which was designed by Adjaye Associates.\n\n\tWalking through Princeton University’s historic campus on my way to PUAM, as crisp leaves fell from their branches, I felt transported to the East Coast collegiate quad that an Ivy League like Princeton typically conjures. That sentiment, however, that did not immediately translate when I reached the new PUAM. It’s hard to miss—obtrusive even. I was struck by how modern the building was in contrast to the surrounding older structures. Walking down its steps into the heart of the building felt like entering the belly of the beast, a kind of sepulcher. A 40-foot-tall colorful, abstract mosaic by Nick Cave, made to resemble one of his iconic “Soundsuits” didn’t help much to assuage those somber feelings.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe building itself, featuring nine interlocking modernist pavilions in stone aggregate, has its own knotty history. When allegations of sexual misconduct against David Adjaye, the principal of Adjaye Associates, surfaced in 2023, the building was already more than half-way completed. Though the celebrated Ghanaian British architect has denied those accusations, he stepped back from his work at PUAM, among other projects—a point the museum’s leadership briefly made during a recent press briefing ahead of the building’s public opening.\n\n\tThough my initial read of the space seemed cold, this feeling, luckily, did not last. In fact, the longer I spent at PUAM the more an opposing sentiment washed over me. Visitors can enter the museum from any of its four sides, making it a mere 10-minute walk from each of Princeton’s on-campus residence halls—a reflection of its openness and accessibility.\n\n\tBut despite its upgraded size, the redesigned museum never felt daunting. There’s something intimate about how the installation of its collection—one of the oldest in the country and now numbering around 2,000 objects—has been realized. Located in central New Jersey, between Manhattan and Philadelphia, PUAM now has the footprint to match its ambition of being a leading museum for its students and the community at large.\n\n\n\tThe new PUAM building is, in fact, quite long, connected via two interior “artwalks.” At its center is an open hall that is typically furnished with comfortable seating and couches, but can be converted into lecture hall or performance space, with retractible seating and walls for additional privacy.\n\n\tFrom the two adjoining artwalks, visitors can see three stories of built-in shelves lined with various art objects, from an abstract work that Frank Stella painted in 1958, the year he graduated from the university, to an Ancient Roman mosaic floor that was excavated by Princeton archaeologists in Türkiye during the 1930s.\n\n\tMuch of the museum’s current curation incorporates this kind of ahistorical abutment—pairing together seemingly disparate works to tell a new kind of story. Other examples include Andy Warhol’s Blue Marilyn (1962) next to Giovanni di Tano Fei’s Virgin and Child (late 14th century) as a way to think about different forms of iconography and worship, or the juxtaposition in one gallery of Titus Kaphar’s To Be Sold (2018), a Charles Wilson Peale portrait of George Washington (ca. 1787), and a Nkisi (power figure) from the early 20th century to an unattributed Kongo artist.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInterview view of Princeton University Art Museum , 2025. In the foreground lies Gisant: knight in armor, ca. 1500, by an unidentified artist; in the background from left to right is Teresa Margolles’ El manto negro (The Black Shroud), 2020, and Sally Mann’s Was Ever Love (2009).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto Francesca Aton / ARTnews\n\t\n\n\n\n\tOne particularly striking section focuses on different representations of grief, bringing together the life-size horizontal stone statue Gisant: knight in armor (ca. 1500) by an unidentified artist; Sally Mann’s photograph of her ailing husband, titled Was Ever Love (2009); El manto negro (The Black Shroud), a 2020 ceramic installation by Teresa Margolles; and Christian Boltanski’s mixed-media installation featuring found photographs of Jewish students prior to the Nazi annexation of Austria. The profound care with which these objects were made undergird life’s most profound loves—and losses.\n\n\tThese works and others, like those by contemporary art stars Gerhard Richter, Diana Al-Hadid, Sean Scully, and Rose B. Simpson, form the basis of the 150-work exhibition “Princeton Collects,” which takes over the second floor galleries and is on view until next March. Also on view is “Toshiko Takaezu: Dialogues in Clay,” which highlights PUAM’s deep holdings of the ceramicist, who taught at Princeton for more than 20 years.\n\n\tAs I continued to walk through its galleries, PUAM seemed to just keep going, with seemingly no end in sight—not a bad thing for a museum of this size. It sparked in me a frenzied moment of obsession to cram in as much viewing as I could. To really see everything on view its current display, visitors should on plan on more than a few hours.\n\n\tNear the end of the my visit, I stumbled on a conservation lab, tucked away from the galleries yet seamlessly integrated into the museum at large. The lab, along with several classrooms on the first floor, is one of many spaces dedicated to object-based learning opportunities for Princeton’s students. Princeton has long offered art conservation classes, cross-listed for multiple majors, but until now, due to spatial constraints, these classes were held in a separate building. Now all this learning can happen in one unified building.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe HeadlinesROYAL FLUSH. During the marquee New York sales next month, Maurizio Cattelan, whose duct-taped banana sold for $6.2 million last year, might just steal the show one more time. That at least seems to be what Sotheby’s is betting on when it offers the Italian conceptual prankster infamous 18-karat, solid gold toilet. Titled America (2016), it will be plumbed into a bathroom in the Breuer Building , Sotheby’s new HQ, and visitors will be invited to view it one-by-one beginning November 8. In an auction first, when the 100-kilogram toilet hits the block on November 18, the starting bid will be determined by the price of the work’s weight in gold—or around $10 million. “Cattelan’s incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value has never felt more timely,” Sotheby’s said in a statement. Sotheby’s confirmed to ARTnews that no bidders have dropped a big deposit to secure the work with an irrevocable bid ahead of the sale.BLURRED LINES. The boundaries of artist representation are shifting in today’s art market, the Art Newspaper writes. New York–based artist Tom Sachs is now represented by The Lede Company, a PR agency rather than a gallery. The announcement clarified that Thaddaeus Ropac , Sachs’s long-time dealer, remains responsible for his fine art, while The Lede will handle brand and media collaborations. This division raises questions about where a gallery’s remit ends and an agency’s begins. Sachs’s practice, rooted in critiques of consumer culture, has evolved to embrace high-profile partnerships, including with Levi’s and Nike, for whom he designed the Mars Yard 3.0 sneakers and a related app. He describes Nike as a “megaphone” for his ideas, giving him reach far beyond the art market.The DigestScientific art analysis firm ArtDiscovery has unveiled what it called the “world’s first insured authenticity guarantee for artworks.” The new product pairs connoisseurship and provenance research with laboratory science and proprietary AI, and then backs the conclusion with an insurance policy from an A+ rated insurer.

    "body": "\n\tAs the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) prepares to fully open it doors on Saturday, the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is calling on the country’s president to allocate some of the museum’s revenue in support of animals giving tourist rides to the museum and surrounding historic sites in Giza.\n\n\tToday, PETA Asia sent a letter to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi notifying him of PETA’s recently released video footage of the dead bodies of horses and camels stacked outside the new museum’s walls.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“Every single day, they are dumped like trash, and the world is horrified,” the letter from PETA senior vice president Jason Baker reads. “While millions of visitors will be drawn to the GEM because of Egypt’s cultural achievements, they may also witness animals being beaten, denied water, and forced to work until their bodies give out, their lifeless bodies piling up just beyond the walls of the pyramids. Such suffering devastates the animals and harms Egypt’s international reputation as a leading, compassionate tourist destination.”\n\n\tThe video shows the bodies dumped along the side of the road, many appearing emaciated and wounded. Their treatment has been documented by PETA over the last six years. According to the organization, these animals have been punched, kicked, whipped, starved, and forced to carry people in the heat without shade or adequate water, before being left for dead or slaughtered when they are no longer of use.\n\n\tIn an effort to rectify the situation, PETA wrote, “We urge you to allocate a portion of the museum’s profits to create a sanctuary that would relocate and retire every single horse and camel from the pyramids area.” Adding that, “Establishing such a refuge would demonstrate Egypt’s moral leadership and signal to the world that kindness and heritage can coexist in harmony.”\n\n\tSince PETA began its efforts, more than 50 tour operators and travel companies, including Airbnb, Marriott, British Airways Holidays, Abercrombie & Kent Travel Group, and TCS World Travel, have stopped offering camel rides to the Giza pyramids.\n\n\tPETA has also asked members and supporters to sign a petition asking Egyptian officials to ban the use of horses and camels to transport visitors to the pyramids and other tourist sites.\n\n\n\tThe letter ends with an appeal from PETA to President El-Sisi to “use this historic moment to honor Egypt’s past and its boundless capacity for mercy and progress.”\n",

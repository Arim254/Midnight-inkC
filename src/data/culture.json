    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom a variety of natural colors of clay, Léonore Chastagner sculpts tender representations of the human form. She details the wrinkles on one’s knuckles, the creases in a pair of denim jeans, and the intricate layers of a loosely folded T-shirt. \n“I use clay as one uses a diary: to record the feelings of daily life and the things that surround me,” Chastagner tells Colossal. “I take interest in what’s in front of me when I’m alone: my apartment, clothes, small gestures of the body.”\nUntitled (2022), ceramic, 51 x 65 x 45 centimeters. Photo by jclett\nChastagner’s background in art history also influences her work, especially through the lens of archaeology and the often mysterious origins or uses of small figurines or personal objects. She’s particularly interested in the kinds of talismans and goods that were buried with the deceased in order to accompany the soul to the afterlife—a ritual seen in myriad ancient cultures around the globe.\nClay is itself a timeless and inherently malleable medium, which Chastagner appreciates for the range of techniques and consistencies she can work with. Because the material is soft and immediately responsive to touch, it represents a kind of freedom and openness. “I was also drawn to (clay’s) simplicity,” the artist says. “It’s a natural material that’s been used by human beings since the earliest civilisations. It has a universal quality.”\nRecently, Chastagner has been working on a series of domestic environments, such as small bedrooms and living rooms. These move beyond objects or figurative gestures to consider the spaces that encompass the body and evoke a sense of nostalgia for miniatures, like dollhouses.\nThe artist’s work will be on view in a solo presentation during Ceramic Brussels, which runs January 21 to 25, and celebrates her win of the fair’s juried Art Prize last year. Chastagner is also working toward solo exhibitions opening in April at Centrale in Brussels and in May at Galerie Anne-Sarah Bénichou in Paris.

The art market media declared a once-again \"healthy\" market reemerging from a protracted slump. \"The entire week becomes a choreographed attempt to convince the world that everything is fine, that the market is strong, that the system still works,\" writes artist Damien Davis in our top piece this week. \"But everything is not fine. And most of the people making the work that keeps this machine running know it.\" While Davis writes from the perspective of the 99% of artists who don't partake in this blue-chip carnival, Marc Straus writes as a veteran art dealer who's been around the auction block many times. In an eye-opening essay, he explains why the market is in a much worse shape than many realize, citing the closure of at least 60 art galleries in recent years.Meanwhile, the world keeps turning, and another Thanksgiving came upon us in the United States. This year, amid high levels of political and social unease, we decided to put together a feel-good list of all the things we're grateful for in the art world. It ranges from thoughtful rehangs and no-strings-attached grants to gallery dogs and desserts at a specific museum cafe. Enjoy it.

    "body": "\n\tSotheby’s has unveiled the full contents of its Old Master and 19th century evening sale, slated for December 3 in London, saying the works are defined by “exceptional and scholarly significance and rare discoveries.” Of the 31 works, half have been hidden from public view for more than a century, while 12 have not been seen on the secondary market in 40 years. The house said the auction is one of the “greatest assemblages of Old Masters presented at Sotheby’s London in the last six years.”Among the top lots are Hans Eworth’s Portrait of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk (1652), which is making its auction debut with a high estimate of £3 million. The house said it “offers a striking glimpse into the artistry and political intrigue of the Tudor court.” The Census at Bethlehem (1566) by Pieter Brueghel the Younger will also hit the auction block with a high estimate of £5 million, as well as the rediscovered Peter Paul Rubens oil sketch, The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne adored by Saints of the House of Habsburg (high estimate: £3 million). A £7 million high estimate has been slapped on Rembrandt’s portrait of Saint John on Patmos.“This is such a special season, defined by truly great works,” Elisabeth Lobkowicz, Sotheby’s head of department and evening sale, Old Master paintings, told ARTnews. “In many instances the importance of these paintings has only recently been recognised, thanks to the enormous amount of research my colleagues have done, working—in some instances for months, even years—with outside scholars to shed new light on their authorship and history. The galleries look stunning, filled with an array of beautiful paintings, each with a fascinating story to tell. They are already working their magic on art lovers from across the globe, and we hope everyone can come into the galleries and experience these paintings firsthand. It’s an auction not to be missed.”The sale will also feature works from the collection of Dr Hinrich Bischoff. They include Lucas van Valckenborch’s Autumn: Landscape with Archduke Matthias of Austria with members of his court at the Vintage (1597)—high estimate: £800,000—and the artist’s The Crucifixion of Christ on Mount Calvary (1568), which has a high estimate of £400,000.The works went on public view at Sotheby’s on New Bond Street on Friday.\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n",

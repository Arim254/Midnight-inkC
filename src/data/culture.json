    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 30th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nGrant­ed access to a time machine, few of us would pre­sum­ably opt first for the expe­ri­ence of skull surgery by the Incas. Yet our chances of sur­vival would be bet­ter than if we under­went the same pro­ce­dure 400 years lat­er, at least if it took place on a Civ­il War bat­tle­field. In both fif­teenth-cen­tu­ry Peru and the nine­teenth-cen­tu­ry Unit­ed States, sur­geons were per­form­ing a lot of trepa­na­tion, or removal of a por­tion of the skull. Since the Neolith­ic peri­od, indi­vid­u­als had been trepanned for a vari­ety of rea­sons, some of which now sound more med­ical­ly com­pelling than oth­ers, but the Incan civ­i­liza­tion took it to anoth­er lev­el of fre­quen­cy, and indeed sophis­ti­ca­tion.\nAny­one with an inter­est in the his­to­ry of tech­nol­o­gy would do well to study the Incas, who were remark­able in both what they devel­oped and what they did­n’t. Though there was no Incan alpha­bet, there was khipu, (or quipu), pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture, a sys­tem of record-keep­ing that used noth­ing but knot­ted cords.\nThe Incas may not have had wheeled vehi­cles or mechan­i­cal devices as we know them today, but they did have pre­ci­sion mason­ry, an exten­sive road sys­tem, advanced water man­age­ment for agri­cul­tur­al and oth­er uses, high-qual­i­ty tex­tiles, and plant-derived anti­sep­tic — some­thing more than a lit­tle use­ful if you also hap­pen to be cut­ting a lot of holes in peo­ple’s skulls.\nStudy­ing the his­to­ry of trepa­na­tion, neu­rol­o­gist David Kush­n­er, along with bioar­chae­ol­o­gists John Ver­a­no and Anne Titel­baum, exam­ined more than 600 Peru­vian skulls dat­ing from between 400 BC and the mid-six­teenth-cen­tu­ry, which marked the end of the Incans’ 133-year-long run. As Sci­ence’s Lizzie Wade reports, the old­est evi­dence shows an unen­vi­able 40% sur­vival rate, but the sur­gi­cal tech­nique evolved over time: by the Inca era, the num­ber ris­es to between 75% and 83%, as against 46% to 56% in Civ­il War mil­i­tary hos­pi­tals. Some Incan skulls even show signs of hav­ing under­gone up to sev­en suc­cess­ful trepa­na­tions — or non-fatal ones, at any rate. Though that ven­er­a­ble form of surgery may no longer be prac­ticed, mod­ern neu­ro­sur­geons today use tech­niques based on the same prin­ci­ples. Should we find our­selves in need of their ser­vices, we’ll no doubt pre­fer to keep our dis­tance from the time machine.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nDis­cov­er Khipu, the Ancient Incan Record & Writ­ing Sys­tem Made Entire­ly of Knots\nBehold the Medieval Wound Man: The Poor Soul Who Illus­trat­ed the Injuries a Per­son Might Receive Through War, Acci­dent or Dis­ease\nJazz Musi­cian Plays Acoustic Gui­tar While Under­go­ing Brain Surgery, Help­ing Doc­tors Mon­i­tor Their Progress\nArti­fi­cial Intel­li­gence & Drones Uncov­er 303 New Naz­ca Lines in Peru\nHow the “First Pho­to­jour­nal­ist,” Math­ew Brady, Shocked the Nation with Pho­tos from the Civ­il War\nDown­load 100,000+ Images From The His­to­ry of Med­i­cine, All Free Cour­tesy of The Well­come Library\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nRegina Silveira has spent the better part of three decades considering the relationship between media and meaning, particularly as it relates to Latin America. Based in São Paulo, Silveira is a pioneer of Brazilian conceptual art who is known for utilizing light, installation, and photos to consider how images circulate and tell stories. One of her projects working in this vein is Latin American Puzzle, a series that assembles sprawling visual narratives like jigsaws.\nFirst presented in 1997, “To Be Continued…” features 100 black-and-white reproductions of photos, newspaper clippings, propaganda, advertisements, and more. Silveira nests each image into an oversized puzzle piece, which cuts off faces and scenes to leave fragments of pop culture icons, flora and fauna, and even the occasional mugshot spliced next to one another. Rather than organizing pieces by time period, geography, or thematic context, these juxtapositions create what the artist calls “a patchwork quilt of entropic character” that leaves a more complicated view of Latin America.\n\n“To Be Continued…” is on view this month at Alexander Gray Associates alongside the latest iteration of the work, “Continued…” Together, the large-scale installations present Silveira’s evolving considerations of a region that continues to grapple with its post-colonial environment and unending interventions by world powers. \nBlack pieces and occasional white gaps suggest both loss and an opening for new additions, while the grooved edges seemingly allow for reconfiguration. Combined with titles that end in ellipses, the malleable compositions portray narratives that are always in flux.\nSee Latin American Puzzle through February 14 in New York. Find more from Silveira on her website.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation view of ‘Regina Silveira: Latin American Puzzle,’ Alexander Gray Associates, New York (2026)\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Funderburke announced her decision to step down from the ACA, an organization that provides support and resources for artists and artist residencies, earlier this month. In a January 20 email, ACA Board Chair Kibra Yohannes celebrated Funderburke's “exemplary service.” “With Lisa’s partnership, we built a board that is more reflective of our field,” Yohannes said. “We grew organizational capacity and increased support for artists. We deepened our commitment to access, moving from a transactional membership model to a values-based network.”The Newark Museum of Art is New Jersey’s largest fine art museum, with 300,000 objects spanning art, science, and natural history. Funderburke takes the helm as institutions across the country confront new challenges under the Trump administration. Before leading ACA, Funderburke served as the associate director of the McColl Center for Art + Innovation in Charlotte, North Carolina. She served on the boards of the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, and is currently a board member at the Performing Arts Alliance and the Center for Cultural Innovation in Los Angeles.In addition to arts administration experience, she holds a Master’s degree in biology from Howard University, bringing a scientific background that the museum welcomed in a press release announcing her appointment. In a statement, Funderburke said she believes “museums are most vital when they are responsive, collaborative, and deeply connected to the communities they serve.”“Throughout my career, I have seen how cultural institutions function as essential civic infrastructure,” Funderburke said.“I am excited to work with the Newark community and broader networks of artists and partners to position the museum as a leader in national and global conversations about art, science, and cultural exchange, stewarding the museum as a shared public space for learning, creativity, and dialogue,” she continued. Funderburke's new appointment will be effective February 1, the Newark Museum of Art said. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Newark Museum of Art\n                      \n                      \n                        Newark\n                      \n                      \n                        New Jersey\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

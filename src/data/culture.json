    "body": "\n\tin Film |   \tJanuary 22nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nUn Chien Andalou means “an Andalu­sian dog,” though the much-stud­ied 1929 short film of that title con­tains no dogs at all, from Andalu­sia or any­where else. In fact, it alludes to a Span­ish expres­sion about how the howl­ing of an Andalu­sian sig­nals that some­one has died. And indeed, there is death in Un Chien Andalou, as well as sex, albeit death and sex as processed through the uncon­scious minds of the young film­mak­er Luis Buñuel and artist Sal­vador Dalí, whose col­lab­o­ra­tion on this endur­ing­ly strange movie did much to make their names. Two of its mem­o­rable images — among six­teen straight min­utes of mem­o­rable images — came straight from their dreams: a hand crawl­ing with ants, and a razor blade slic­ing the moon as if it were an eye.\n“Less than two min­utes into the pic­ture, a man — played by the stocky, unmiss­able fig­ure of Buñuel him­self — stands on a bal­cony, gaz­ing wolfish­ly at the moon,” writes New York­er film crit­ic Antho­ny Lane. “Cut to the face of a woman. Cut back to the moon; a thin slice of cloud drifts across its face. Cut to an eye; a razor blade knifes neat­ly and with­out hes­i­ta­tion across the eye­ball, whose con­tents well and spill like an out­sized tear. Cut. At this point, if you are of a ner­vous dis­po­si­tion, you faint.”\nBuñuel him­self told Dalí that the sequence made him sick, though he also pub­licly described Un Chien Andalou as “a des­per­ate and pas­sion­ate appeal to mur­der.” Aller­gic to the direct incor­po­ra­tion of pol­i­tics into art, he pre­ferred to use the tech­niques of Sur­re­al­ism to advo­cate for the destruc­tion of soci­ety itself.\nYet as their careers went on, Buñuel and Dalí even­tu­al­ly occu­pied respect­ed posi­tions in soci­ety. Curi­ous! Though Buñuel would keep recom­mit­ting to the pow­er of absur­di­ty through­out his fil­mog­ra­phy (not least in the sev­en­ties with his final tril­o­gy, The Dis­creet Charm of the Bour­geoisie, The Phan­tom of Lib­er­ty, and That Obscure Object of Desire), it is Un Chien Andalou that holds the title of one of the most impor­tant works in the his­to­ry of cin­e­ma, rec­og­nized even by those who’ve nev­er seen it, some of whom no doubt sus­pect they could­n’t bear to. But if they can sum­mon the will, they’ll find the film’s parade of unset­tling­ly coher­ent inco­her­ence is more acces­si­ble than ever, since it has now fall­en into the pub­lic domain, accord­ing to the Inter­net Archive. Its sense of humor may sur­prise them, but so too may the undi­min­ished vivid­ness of its flash­es of sex and death, which have always been stand­bys of cin­e­ma — and of dreams.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nTwo Vin­tage Films by Sal­vador Dalí and Luis Buñuel: Un Chien Andalou and L’Age d’Or\nWatch Luis Buñuel’s Sur­re­al Trav­el Doc­u­men­tary A Land With­out Bread (1933)\nThe 10 Favorite Films of Avant-Garde Sur­re­al­ist Film­mak­er Luis Buñuel (Includ­ing His Own Col­lab­o­ra­tion with Sal­vador Dalí)\nSal­vador Dalí Goes to Hol­ly­wood & Cre­ates a Wild Dream Sequence for Alfred Hitch­cock\nDavid Lynch Presents the His­to­ry of Sur­re­al­ist Film (1987)\nFilm­mak­er Luis Buñuel Shows How to Make the Per­fect Dry Mar­ti­ni\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 21st, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nBuck­min­ster Fuller was, in many ways, a twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry man: an achieve­ment in itself, con­sid­er­ing he was born in the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry and died in the twen­ti­eth. In fact, it may actu­al­ly count as his defin­ing achieve­ment. For all the inven­tions pre­sent­ed as rev­o­lu­tion­ary that nev­er real­ly caught on — the Dymax­ion house and car, the geo­des­ic dome — as well as the count­less pages of eccen­tri­cal­ly the­o­ret­i­cal writ­ing and even more count­less hours of talk, it can be dif­fi­cult for us now, here in the actu­al twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry, to pin down the civ­i­liza­tion­al impact he so earnest­ly longed to make. But to the extent that he embod­ied the faith, born of the com­bi­na­tion of indus­tri­al might and exis­ten­tial dread that col­ored the post­war Amer­i­can zeit­geist, that tech­nol­o­gy can ratio­nal­ly re-shape the world, we’re all his intel­lec­tu­al chil­dren.\nIn the video above, Joe Scott pro­vides an intro­duc­tion to Fuller and his world in about ten min­utes. After a much-ref­er­enced Dam­a­scene con­ver­sion, the once-dis­solute Fuller spent most of his life “try­ing to solve the world’s prob­lems,” Scott says, “specif­i­cal­ly in find­ing ways to save resources and pro­vide for every­body on the plan­et: to do more with less, as we would say.”\nThe title he gave him­self of “com­pre­hen­sive antic­i­pa­to­ry design sci­en­tist” neat­ly rep­re­sents both his glob­al­ly, even uni­ver­sal­ly scaled ambi­tions, as well as his com­pul­sive knack for self-pro­mo­tion. If the designs he came up with to achieve his utopi­an ends nev­er took root in soci­ety (even geo­des­ic domes end­ed up as some­thing like “the hula hoop of twen­ti­eth-cen­tu­ry archi­tec­ture,” James Gle­ick writes, in that they were “every­where, and then they were a bit sil­ly”), the prob­lem had in part to do with the ten­den­cy of his grand visions to out­pace the func­tion­al tech­nol­o­gy of his day.\nIn his sen­si­bil­i­ty, too, “Bucky” Fuller can come off as a famil­iar type in our own time, even to those who’ve nev­er heard of him. “There is no doubt what­ev­er in Fuller’s mind that the whole devel­op­ment of mod­ern sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy has result­ed from a will­ing­ness on the part of a very few men to sail into the wind of tra­di­tion, to trust in their own intel­lect, and to take advan­tage of their nat­ur­al mobil­i­ty,” wrote the New York­er’s Calvin Tomp­kins in a 1966 pro­file. No won­der he appealed to the Whole Earth Cat­a­log coun­ter­cul­ture of that decade, which even­tu­al­ly evolved into the cul­ture of what we now call Sil­i­con Val­ley, where no declared inten­tion to rein­vent the way humans live and work is too ridicu­lous­ly ambi­tious. Though few fig­ures could have seemed more like­ly to turn per­ma­nent­ly passé, Buck­min­ster Fuller con­tin­ues to inspire fas­ci­na­tion — and in a way, as a patron saint of tech­no-opti­mism, he lives on today.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nA Three-Minute Intro­duc­tion to Buck­min­ster Fuller, One of the 20th Century’s Most Pro­duc­tive Design Vision­ar­ies\nBuck­min­ster Fuller Tells the World “Every­thing He Knows” in a 42-Hour Lec­ture Series (1975)\nBuck­min­ster Fuller, Isaac Asi­mov & Oth­er Futur­ists Make Pre­dic­tions About the 21st Cen­tu­ry in 1967: What They Got Right & Wrong\nBuck­min­ster Fuller’s Dymax­ion Sleep Plan: He Slept Two Hours a Day for Two Years & Felt “Vig­or­ous” and “Alert”\nThe Life & Times of Buck­min­ster Fuller’s Geo­des­ic Dome: A Doc­u­men­tary\nA New Online Archive Lets You Read the Whole Earth Cat­a­log and Oth­er Whole Earth Pub­li­ca­tions, Tak­ing You from 1970 to 2002\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAcross frameworks devised from vintage potholder looms, Hudson Valley-based artist Pam Connolly weaves personal family narratives and explores notions of home. “I grew up in the 1960s in a typical, post-war suburban neighborhood in New Jersey,” she says. “My parents owned a furniture store that was at the center of our family’s universe—everything revolved around it.”\nAs a child, Connolly roamed the store’s maze of showrooms, immersing herself in the patterns and objects. These curated, aspirational spaces instilled a fascination with make-believe and our surroundings that has accompanied her in her lens-based career for the past three decades.\n“Dad and Rembrandt”\nColumbus Drive, a series of woven family snapshots, channels Connolly’s interest in the relationship between the imaginary and the real, especially through the theme of domestic spaces and family stories. Her work has previously included photographs of tin dollhouses and family portraits that explore the idealized American dream and childhood memories.\nIn the Columbus Drive pieces, Connolly reproduces family snapshots on canvas, which she then cuts into quarter-inch strips and weaves with colored fiber on the metal potholder looms. These vintage objects harken back to the early- to mid-20th-century, when they were conceived as a way for sock manufacturers to not only use but also market their textile scraps. Especially during the Depression era and throughout the midcentury, the tiny kits became incredibly popular.\n“In this body of work, I unravel the unspoken details of childhood and re-tell the story from a new vantage point,” Connolly says. “By creating patterns with colored thread and maneuvering the canvas under and over…a new image and vision is slowly revealed.” Through cutting up and reassembling these immanently personal images, the artist meditates on the era of the 1960s as much as her own recollections and family history.\nSee more of the artist’s work on Instagram, where you can also explore her project called Landau Gallery, a 1:12-scale contemporary art space.\n“Lauren in My Room”\n“Pam and Lovee”\n“Lois, Take the Picture!”\n“Pam and Flower Girl”\n“Lois’ Bat Mitzvah”\n“Mom and Yellow Lamp”\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\n“Some people say that my work questions dominant notions of cultural identity, and perhaps that’s true,” says Bolivian photographer River Claure. “But I’m drawn to many things, such as thinking about landscapes, or the way clouds appear in a bright blue sky in some of my photographs.”\nClaure’s atmospheric photos capture daily life and dream-like scenes in Bolivia, infused with magical realism, that prompt our curiosity about community, narrative, and the land. He’s based in a valley called Cochabamba, where his grandparents immigrated in the 1970s to escape political conflicts in their former home, an Indigenous Andean community called Calacota.\n“Palliri”\nGrowing up, “I was not very conscious—nor did I value my Indigenous roots at all; in fact, it is something I specifically denied,” Claure says in an interview with koozArch. “I remember episodes in my teens where I didn’t want my friends in high school to know that my grandmother was Chola. It was something of which I was ashamed, although of course now, I find that ridiculous.”\nWhen Claure began committing himself seriously to making art, he was awakened to his ancestry and local community in a new way, realizing that what he had tried to suppress in his youth was actually exactly what he most needed to explore. His work is often informed by Christian symbolism, such as in the Virgin Cerro works, in which a figure sits within a mound of sand and assumes the form of a religious icon.\nPlay is another feature of his practice, not just in the tableaux he captures—such as soccer players and expressive local children—but also in his approach. “I would say I play a lot: I play professionally,” Claure says in a statement. “I play in a kind of grand contemporary theater, blending everything: my family’s history, my Indigenous roots, my post-internet contradictions, fashion, literature, the Latin American colonial archive, foundational myths, and much more.”\nHis work is imbued with a sense of nostalgia—a longing for connections to “the mystical, the epic, and the sacred, in order to create rituals of my own invention,” he says. In scenes that volley between happenstance and choreography, he explores time, community, and relationships between reality and fantasy.\n“Villa Adela”\nClaure’s images emphasize individuals, Indigenous customs, the earth, and belief systems as a way of resisting capitalistic influences. And through compositions that feel dreamy and mysterious—even timeless—he generates his own myths as a way to question values and the forces of transition.\nAs part of the 2026 Vital Impacts awards, which support photographers who illuminate environmental challenges within their communities, Claure is the recipient of the E.O. Wilson Fellowship. The fellowship supports his project titled A Boat for the Future of the Mountains, which he describes as “a time capsule project” focused on communities in the Bolivian Andes where lakes and rivers are disappearing.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhat do you want to express that you feel you can’t in everyday life? That’s the question composer and producer Max Cooper posed to his audience in hopes of unearthing some of the hidden parts of our shared emotional landscape. In return, he received more responses than expected, many of which tapped into passionate displays of pleasure and pain. “It was like finding a secret window into our collective psyches,” he writes. \nThese submissions spawned a tender project in collaboration with musician Félix Gerbelot and animator Masanobu Hiraoka. A multi-part endeavor spanning an album and digital installation, On Being opens with a poignant music video. “It started from the sound of Felix Gerbelot’s viola and eventually became the title track of the album,” Cooper shares.\n\n\n\nPaired with the meditative instrumentals, Hiraoka’s monochromatic visuals appear to emerge from a single line, leading viewers on a swirling journey of growth and loss. While the film references what Cooper’s community had shared, it also incorporates Hiraoka’s own family videos through rotoscoping, a technique that involves tracing over live-action footage frame by frame. \n“At first, I planned to create random cuts and gradually link them together. But as I worked, the concept itself evolved, and in the end, I focused more on vivid personal memories,” Hiraoka told It’s Nice That. \nThe result is a tender portrait of universal human emotion, one that races through the birth and development of a child. Energetic and dynamic, the animation gives the feeling of being a bit too quick to allow viewers to savor any singular moment, instead resigning us to a chaotic swirl of time passing.\nFind more of On Being on the project website.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAn unwavering desire to play with scale, permanence, and fragility recurs in Rebecca Manson’s practice. The New York-based artist (previously) is known for magnifying the minuscule and preserving fleeting lifeforms in porcelain, a material regarded for both its resilience and delicacy. These dichotomies emerge through dynamic sculptures of butterflies and moths that drape down walls and across floors in dramatic displays.\nEach wing is comprised of tens of thousands of small, hand-crafted pieces Manson and her team refer to as “smushes.” Layered into undulating compositions, these individual pieces mimic the lush texture of scales and the protective patterns of disguise some species use to hide from predators.\nDetail of “Blue Admiral Wing” (2025)\nManson’s newest body of work is on view next month at Jessica Silverman. Time, You Must Be Laughing takes its name from Joni Mitchell’s 1975 poetic song “Sweet Bird,” which invokes the constancy of change. Works like “Blue Admiral Wing” nest larger, almost agate-like components within rippling lines of smushes, while lustrous and dichroic glazes lend themselves to glimmering, iridescent surfaces.\nFor Manson, understanding that decay is inevitable doesn’t diminish nature’s beauty or intrigue. Instead, her sculptures invite us to get lost in the minute intricacies of each form, embracing the striking, rippling forms as they are in the moment.\nTime, You Must Be Laughing runs from January 8 to February 28 in San Francisco.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen designer Pedro Neves was an undergraduate student, he attended an advanced seminar during which students were charged with creating an alphabet using modular elements. “As someone with minimal experience with type design, I was struck by the excitement of generating letterforms simply by using pre-existing modules,” he says in a statement. Little did he know that the assignment would spur an international participatory and educational project.\nIn his faculty role at the University of Illinois Chicago’s School of Design, Neves organized a graduate course emphasizing modularity for letterform design and typographic compositions. LEGO turned out to be an ideal system, comprising individual elements that operate on a grid and exist in numerous shapes.\nComplete ‘A2Z’ alphabet\n“The system offered an ideal blend of fixed constraints and room for playful exploration. Each brick’s scale and form could not be altered, but the grid’s size could be individually defined,” Neves says. “Students were free to arrange and join bricks, building up their compositions.” It didn’t hurt that they were enthusiastic about LEGO to begin with. And using more portable, inexpensive tools like Provisional Press kits allowed for even more flexibility.\nNeves’ desire to explore the potential of LEGO in print led to further collaborations with designers from around the world, each of whom he challenged to create a distinctive letterform. These contributions, submitted from 36 individual designers or studios on six continents, are now compiled in a publication called A2Z: Learning Through LEGO® and Letterforms, which is complemented by an exhibition currently on view at the Design Museum of Chicago.\nNeves offered to send participants a physical LEGO set so they could tinker with ideas by hand. Then, for their final designs, which could be layered up to three times to achieve different colors and effects, the designers could use five colors loosely based on CMYK, which Neves selected from the Pantone color system. Every letterform incorporates some combination or selection of aqua, red, yellow, purple, and green.\nEunice Chong, for example, rendered a verdant “R” and shares that her piece embodies aspects of the urban identity and cultural heritage of Singapore, where she calls home. “I drew inspiration from the patterns of Peranakan tiles, known for their ornate designs,” she says. “The floral and greenery elements reflect Singapore’s reputation as a Garden City, where nature is thoughtfully integrated into its urban landscape.”\nJennifer Wandro\nOnce the designers had created their pieces, they returned digital templates to Neves so that the compositions could be set up using physical bricks and run through a large press in the UIC print lab. The process involved over 8,000 bricks and more than 27,000 hand-operated printing passes that took Neves and his students eight months to complete. \nThe exhibition at Design Museum of Chicago displays the original LEGO letterform constructions alongside their letterpress prints. Plan your visit on the museum’s website, and see more of Neves’ work on Instagram and his website, where he has shared extensive open-source information about the project.\nYou might also enjoy Roy Scholten’s LEGO letterpress birds.\nEunice Chong\nThe printing process in the UIC print lab\nNaz Naddaf + Nabil Nasr\nRaven Mo\nStudio Dobra (João Guedes)\nThe printing process in the UIC print lab\nD Josh Cook\nThe printing process in the UIC print lab\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

With these works, the artist aims to reinterpret an encyclopedic range of images — from the political to the iconic and the lesser-known — with a deeply personal, intuitive visual language. In an age of extreme subjectivity, dopamine loops, and fame cycles shrinking faster than a Warholian prophecy, Wright isn’t interested in decoding the chaos so much as metabolizing it. Curated by Jesse Bandler Firestone, Alexa, Truth or Dare? is on view at 545 West 23rd Street until January 20, 2026.To collapse a hierarchy of images, Wright pulls source material from literally everywhere: personal archives, sports photography, niche internet culture, found objects, and historical documents. The iconic sits shoulder-to-shoulder with the mundane, the political with the personal, the tragic with the absurd — all filtered through the same graphic logic.Rendered in oil atop spray-painted color fields akin to acid-laced tie-dye, his characters hover between figuration and abstraction, presence and outline. To honor these figures, Wright paints them monumental in scale, yet thin, intentionally exaggerated, elongated, and queered. Their hands stand out as avatars of artistic agency, tenderness, and Wright’s ongoing distortion of visual representation. In his eyes, men, nuns, women, and children alike all don the longest of acrylic nails.In a cultural moment saturated with noise, Wright’s paintings attempt to make the cacaphony legible, not by taming it, but by letting it be strange, sensual, and alive.To learn more, visit connorwright.art.\n                  \n                      \n                        Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Exhibition Announcement\n                      \n                      \n                        Sponsored\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                  \n        ",

The black and white spray-painted work binds immigration crackdowns to an erosion of civil liberties more broadly. Reached by Hyperallergic, Groupp said he was paid $120 to create the work, but declined to state by whom.\"It visualizes a fear shared by millions: that the values we claim to stand for — justice, sanctuary, and freedom — are being detained and carried off in plain sight,\" Groupp said in a statement. \"It’s a reminder that freedom is never guaranteed; it must be defended.\"Groupp said he was inspired by Keith Haring. Groupp's scene of ICE arresting the Statue of Liberty punctuates a particularly notorious year in United States immigration history, one defined by the arrest of a pro-Palestinian student protester and green card holder, Mahmoud Khalil; the deportation of hundreds of men to the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador; and the targeting of immigrants with no criminal history.The subway entrance artwork continues a renewed use of the Statue of Liberty as an anti-Trump symbol. In a Northern French town earlier this year, Dutch street artist Judith de Leeuw portrayed a massive Statue of Liberty in a gesture of shame as a commentary against the Trump administration's deportation policies. In the spring, the White House rebuked a comment by a French politician calling for the repatriation of the sculpture, which has occupied the New York harbor since 1886.Groupp's piece echoes guerrilla artworks by the collective Vjaybombs, which projected portrayals of ICE agents arresting Jesus in Los Angeles earlier this fall.The artist said he was paid $120 to create the artwork.In a statement to Hyperallergic, Groupp said that his work has not always been overtly political but that \"recent events\" have pushed him to make it so. He added that he drew inspiration for this design from the work of Keith Haring, who transformed the subway system into a canvas for political chalk art calling attention to issues including the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\"After sketching the image across several digital platforms, I realized that referencing Keith Haring’s visual economy made the message stronger,\" Groupp said. \"Reducing the imagery to its simplest form—almost like a subway drawing—allowed the idea to speak more forcefully. Haring’s work was an act of defiance in itself: immediate, public, and unapologetically provocative. That spirit felt essential to the message.\"\"Attack on Liberty\" has been vandalized twice, Groupp said. Images shared with Hyperallergic show the work tagged with \"communist\" and \"dead.\" Groupp has been regularly touching up the piece.Groupp said he plans to offer prints for sale through his Instagram with proceeds directed toward the New York Immigration Coalition's Emergency Justice Fund. The work will remain on view through January.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        ICE\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                  \n        ",

E. B. Du Bois at Pratt Manhattan Gallery, two identical, stark-white busts face off. Mirror images, they are separated by a hollow metal apparatus, a window of sorts. The sculpture, “Untitled” (2022), by the late artist Radcliffe Bailey, is a striking visual metaphor for W. E. B. Du Bois’s doctrine of double consciousness, the social historian’s conceptualization of African Americans’ racial positioning post-emancipation. In their orientation, the twin busts suggest the crisis of identity experienced under the duress of racism; the subjects’ autonomous self-fashioning is at odds with their marginalized civic position.“Untitled” is a succinct primer for In Our Time, which gathers 11 artists to address the contemporary resonances of Du Bois’s philosophies, research, and legacy at large. These artists make meaning out of complex, interconnected histories in their practices; like Du Bois, they are aware of the potential of visual language to disseminate social philosophy to a wide audience. In another gallery, two faces composed of geometric shapes merge together in Derrick Adams’s “Fixing My Face” (2021). The painting calls to mind again the concept of double consciousness and invokes the simultaneous positive and negative potential of collectivization — the possibility for resistance, community, and intimacy at odds with racism’s desire to extinguish autonomy.Derrick Adams, \"Fixing My Face\" (2021), acrylic paint and fabric collage on paper on wood panel, Steel shelf and two plaster bustsJulie Mehretu, \"Circulation\" (2005), color hard-ground etching with aquatint and engraving on Gampi paper chine colléThe exhibition’s centerpiece is a multimedia installation by Ann Messner, “Du Bois: The FBI Files” (2013). Stacks of documents are piled in corners throughout the building, and speakers emit audio from interviews and excerpts by Black musicians and activists, like Nina Simone and Angela Davis. Spread across a long table are declassified, heavily redacted FBI files on Du Bois. Messner has further manipulated these censored images, cutting and reconfiguring heavy strips of blacked-out text, leaving in their place negative space tethered by fine threads, highlighting their relation to blackness and void, to censorship and derogation. In these pages, the FBI concealed the names of Du Bois’s vitriolic opponents; the snippets that remain reveal a government terrified of racial uplift, of a challenge to the status quo.One video on view particularly captivated me: Jefferson Pinder’s “float” (2019), a recorded performance honoring the life of Eugene Williams, a 17-year-old who was stoned to death in 1919 after floating over to the White side of a segregated beach in Chicago. “float” begins with lines of demonstrators marching into the lapping water, almost militarized. Tension builds between the presumed purpose of a beach — recreation — and the performance’s goal of protest. The participants’ bodies float on rubber tubes; they are linked by ropes held between their hands, a human flotilla. Their performance-action took place exactly one century after Williams’s brutal murder, highlighting the interconnectedness between historical event and contemporary art and experience. It undergirds the exhibition's thesis: the doggedness of antiblackness in the United States and the persistence of artists, writers, and activists who will not let it go unrecorded. In Our Time is a reprisal of an earlier show, Du Bois In Our Time at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2013, also curated by Loretta Yarlow. The subject of Du Bois’s prevailing influence over social theory and racial philosophy proves just as relevant — this relationship could be revisited again and again, with a cast of artists both new and returning, continuing the pursuit of a more just world.Ann Messner, \"Du Bois: The FBI Files,\" detail (2013), 47 running foot incised digital scroll; 22 foot table inset with 6 in-wall MP5 Niles speakers, CD players, 4 CDsIn Our Time: Eleven Artists + W.

There were two of her, really.One was the photographer featured in a current retrospective at Tate Britain, who was born in New York in 1907, moved to Paris in 1929, and then to London. She went to Europe in restless pursuit of the desire for others to believe in everything she had to offer — her multiple gifts as an artist, for example.The other was a model. Modeling in New York in the 1920s was her opening gambit. She had the looks and poise to succeed and her talents were quickly recognized. She arrived in Paris in the flapper era — sinuously tall, her hair close-cropped. My goodness, that wonderful androgynous look! She seemed made for the part — and the historical moment.But modeling had its limitations. Was there not too much idle self-regard in that ready capitulation to another’s camera? Perhaps. She had too much energy and ambition to be someone else’s glamorous image of the passing moment.Arnold Genthe, \"Lee Miller, New York\" (c. 1927) (photo Michael Glover/Hyperallergic)So she went to work for Man Ray in Paris. She modeled for him — but it was much more than that. They worked together on Surrealist experimentation. She took pictures and did some odd freakery on them: solarization, deep shadow, the isolating of strange and provocative detail. They collaborated, but unsurprisingly she did not get full credit for what she did. He tended to claim that what emerged from the studio of Man Ray (emphasis on Man?) was his. She needed to wrest back control, to be the one calling the shots. She returned to London in 1939 and worked as a fashion photographer for Vogue magazine. The shadows of war loomed over. Her art began to take on a new urgency, and to strike a note that any small and embattled country needs to strike if it is to retain its morale, its need to fight back against a dangerously predatory enemy.Lee Miller, \"David E. Scherman dressed for war, London\" (1942) (Lee Miller Archives © Lee Miller Archives, England 2025, all rights reserved, leemiller.co.uk)She made images of women in the not-so-glamorous clothing that wartime demanded, but she did it with style and aplomb — in Miller’s hands, the stuff of war looked positively alluring. In addition to the working women, she photographed the London Blitz. In one photograph, a bomb-blasted gap in a London terrace looks like a conscious act of framing. She posed a model in a ruined street, as if a fleeting instance of beauty could defy the casual barbarism of war. She showed her great courage in roaming those dangerous streets to produce images that were odd, spirited, and spirit-lifting, too — and possessed a quality of defiant humor. Following this, Miller went to Europe to work as an accredited war correspondent with the US Army. Nothing fazed her. She was determined to stare hard into the face of the awful reality of evil on its filthy rampage. Lee Miller, \"Untitled, Paris\" (1930) (Lee Miller Archives © Lee Miller Archives, England 2025, all rights reserved, leemiller.co.uk)She had her friend, Life magazine photographer David Scherman, photograph her bathing in Hitler’s bathtub at his abandoned residence in Munich the day of his suicide in Berlin — that old mix of defiance, poignance, and brazen, oddball humor. She went to the Nazi concentration camps and photographed the worst things that any human being might ever witness. This gallery has a warning notice: not for children. I was told not to photograph her images so I can’t show you what she saw. Lee Miller pushed herself to the limits and beyond, and suffered for it. In later life, she returned to a farm in Sussex and became a gourmet chef, leaving behind the nightmares that she captured on film.Lee Miller, \"Portrait of Space, Al Bulwayeb near Siwa\" (1937) (Lee Miller Archives © Lee Miller Archives, England 2025, all rights reserved, leemiller.co.uk)Lee Miller, \"Fire Masks, Downshire Hill, London\" (1941) (photo Michael Glover/Hyperallergic)Lee Miller continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through February 15, 2026.

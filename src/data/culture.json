But a present made of words takes up very lit­tle space, and it has the Ghost of Christ­mas Past’s pow­er to instant­ly evoke the sender as they once were.\nSev­en­ty years ago, poet Langston Hugh­es, too skint to go Christ­mas shop­ping, sent every­one on his gift list sim­ple, home­made hol­i­day post­cards.

But the opera was a com­mer­cial flop, and pos­i­tive reviews for his book Sim­ple Speaks His Mind failed to trans­late into the hoped-for sales.\nAlthough he had recent­ly pur­chased an East Harlem brown­stone with an old­er cou­ple who dot­ed on him as they would a son, pro­vid­ing him with a sun­ny, top floor work­space, 1950 was far from his favorite year.\nHis type­writ­ten hol­i­day cou­plets took things out on a jaun­ty note, while pay­ing light lip ser­vice to his plight.\n\nMaybe we can aspire to the same…\nHugh­es’ hand­made hol­i­day cards reside in the Langston Hugh­es Papers in Yale’s Bei­necke Rare Book and Man­u­script Library, along with hol­i­day cards spe­cif­ic to the African-Amer­i­can expe­ri­ence received from friends and asso­ciates.\nvia the Bei­necke Rare Book and Man­u­script Library at Yale Uni­ver­si­ty\nRelat­ed Con­tent: \nLangston Hugh­es Reads Langston Hugh­es\nA Sim­ple, Down-to-Earth Christ­mas Card from the Great Depres­sion (1933)\nHear Neil Gaiman Read A Christ­mas Car­ol Just as Dick­ens Read It\nHow Joni Mitchell’s Song of Heart­break, “Riv­er,” Became a Christ­mas Clas­sic\nAyun Hal­l­i­day is an author, illus­tra­tor, and the­ater mak­er in NYC.\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tDecember 22nd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHow­ev­er cel­e­brat­ed by his­to­ri­ans, scru­ti­nized by archae­ol­o­gists, and descend­ed-upon by tourists it may be, Pom­peii is not excep­tion­al — not even in the fate of hav­ing been buried in ash by Mount Vesu­vius in the year 76, which also hap­pened to the near­by town of Her­cu­la­neum. Rather, it is the sheer ordi­nar­i­ness of that medi­um-sized provin­cial Roman city that we most val­ue today, inad­ver­tent­ly pre­served as it was by that vol­canic dis­as­ter. The new Lost in Time video above recon­structs Pom­peii as it must have looked at the very end of its days, tak­ing a look at every­thing from its homes to its aque­ducts, its forum to its basil­i­ca, and its wine and per­fume pro­duc­tion facil­i­ties to its glad­i­a­to­r­i­al are­na.\nUnsur­pris­ing­ly, the Amphithe­atre of Pom­peii is much small­er than the Colos­se­um. But it was actu­al­ly built 140 years ear­li­er, at a time when local lead­ers across the empire were already start­ing to feel that any self-respect­ing Roman town ought to have its own venue for spec­ta­cles involv­ing one-on-one com­bat, feats of ath­leti­cism, exot­ic ani­mals, and even pub­lic exe­cu­tions.\nThe same ulti­mate­ly went for all the types of facil­i­ties unearthed in the entombed city’s pub­lic spaces and pri­vate homes alike, includ­ing baths, snack bars, and din­ing rooms. To that extent, Pom­peii had it all, even if life there lacked the poten­tial for advance­ment and intrigue offered only by the Eter­nal City.\nAs the video gives its tour of a still-thriv­ing Pom­peii, it counts down to the erup­tion of Vesu­vius, which last­ed about two days. “Why did­n’t peo­ple leave the city?” asks the nar­ra­tor. “His­to­ri­ans claim that about 2,000 peo­ple lost their lives in Pom­peii that day, mean­ing about 10,000 man­aged to escape.” It is to the writ­ings of one such escapee, Pliny the Younger, that we owe much of what we know about the expe­ri­ence of the cat­a­stro­phe itself — and to cen­turies of exam­i­na­tion since its redis­cov­ery as an archae­o­log­i­cal site that we have the kind of knowl­edge about the place that goes into a recon­struc­tion like this one. Those efforts have fed our under­stand­ing of life in the ancient world as a whole, for in its after­life, Pom­peii has become not just a medi­um-sized provin­cial Roman city, but the medi­um-sized provin­cial Roman city.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch the Destruc­tion of Pom­peii by Mount Vesu­vius, Re-Cre­at­ed with Com­put­er Ani­ma­tion (79 AD)\nTake a High Def, Guid­ed Tour of Pom­peii\nBehold 3D Recre­ations of Pompeii’s Lav­ish Homes–As They Exist­ed Before the Erup­tion of Mount Vesu­vius\nThe Last Morn­ing in Pom­peii & The Night Pom­peii Died: A New Video Series Explores the End of the Doomed Roman City\nThe Only Writ­ten Eye-Wit­ness Account of Pompeii’s Destruc­tion: Hear Pliny the Younger’s Let­ters on the Mount Vesu­vius Erup­tion\nThe Only Writ­ten Eye-Wit­ness Account of Pompeii’s Destruc­tion: Hear Pliny the Younger’s Let­ters on the Mount Vesu­vius Erup­tion\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nSurreal Salon, the annual international exhibition celebrating the Pop-surrealism/Lowbrow movement, is returning to Baton Rouge Gallery – center for contemporary art (BRG) for its 18th year. Held in partnership with Louisiana State University (LSU)’s School of Art, the show will be open to all at no cost from January 2 to 25, 2026, in Louisiana’s capital city. \nThis year’s multimedia edition features more than 60 artists from the U.S. and abroad, with pieces hand-picked by the show’s Special Guest Juror, Swoon, from a pool of nearly 800 works via a blind jurying process. \nEvery year, Surreal Salon celebrates the ever-evolving Pop-surrealist/Lowbrow art movement by inviting artists across the globe to submit works for consideration. The resulting selection always features paintings, photography, ceramics, textiles, mixed media works, and more. \nKristin Meyers, “Silenced,” mixed media and found objects, 25 x 16 x 11 inches\nOver the years, Surreal Salon has enlisted internationally renowned artists such as Ron English, Camille Rose Garcia, Marco Mazzoni, Beth Cavener, Greg “Craola” Simkins, and many others to serve as jurors and curate engaging, dynamic collections of work for the show. That tradition was renewed in 2026 as Swoon (a.k.a. Caledonia Curry) stepped into this role.\nCurry is a Brooklyn-based street artist who, drawing on both realistic and fantastical elements, has created immersive installations, wheatpaste portraits, and community-based social justice projects for two decades. Her work has adorned the walls of institutions like New York’s Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and Tate Modern, while also appearing on the façades of built environments around the world.\nSwoon will give a talk on Monday, January 26, hosted by LSU’s School of Art in conjunction with Surreal Salon 18. Free and open to all, the talk will touch on her career, her work, and her experience selecting the art for this show. \nBefore the exhibition’s closure, BRG will welcome hundreds of guests to channel their own pop-surrealist visions into elaborate costumes at The Surreal Salon Soiree on Saturday, January 24. The night will celebrate the show with live music from the band Bon Bon Vivant, two different DJ sets, food trucks, and several surprises. Tickets are on sale now, starting at just $40.\nTo learn more and to preview the works included in this year’s exhibition, visit batonrougegallery.org.\nPaige DeVries, “Shadow Boxer,” oil on canvas, 60 x 40 inches\nPeyton Pickenpaugh, “Medusa,” fabric, foam, pins, 57 x 46 x 18 inches\nPrimary graphic for Surreal Salon 18 created by artist Marco Mazzoni\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom inexpensive, ubiquitous, and utilitarian materials, virtually endless forms and narratives can be created with a bit of imagination. That’s exactly what the show Cardboard: Infinite Possibilities, opening next month at Wönzimer Gallery, aims to highlight.\nThe group exhibition is curated by Ann Weber, whose work Colossal readers may recognize, along with that of Narsiso Martinez and Shigeru Ban. The show also highlights an iconic chair design by Frank Gehry, who died this month at the age of 96, plus contributions from Jodi Hays, Edgar Ramirez, Leonie Weber, Samuelle Richardson, Jabila Okongwu, and more.\nFrank Gehry, “Easy Edges Wiggle Chair” (1972), corrugated cardboard and hardboard, 34 x 24 x 17 inches. Courtesy of Frank O. Gehry & Gehry Design, LLC\nIn her own work, Ann Weber has long sought to subvert what we consider a purely functional, disposable medium. Her practice involves meticulously cutting, wrapping, and weaving strips of salvaged cardboard into bulbous, sometimes towering sculptures. Others also embrace this approach, like Martinez, who repurposes discarded produce boxes as a substrate for paintings and drawings, and Leonie Weber, whose painted and crumbled box assemblages appear almost like dyed and felted wool installations at first glance.\nBan’s sustainable approach to architecture using cardboard emphasizes how the medium can be transformed from cheap packaging material to humanitarian design, where tubes can be used as modular units to build rapid-response shelters.\nCardboard: Infinite Possibilities runs from January 2 to 30 in Los Angeles.

(photo Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images)\n    \n        \n            Imagine your car is stolen. Overnight, you lose your ability to get to work, visit loved ones, or reach a hospital in an emergency. Years later, your car turns up in a different neighborhood. The new “owner” drives it daily. They even landed a better job, with a pay rise, thanks to their new, stolen ride. So, you contact the police and demand its return. But the current driver has conditions. They will only give your car back if you wash it regularly, drive it frequently, and build a secure garage with modern locks. Alternatively, they suggest you can borrow your own car for three years — but then must give it back to them. After all, they argue, they have more money, time, and expertise to take care of it. Absurd? Welcome to the British Museum’s understanding of justice.  The British Museum houses one of the world’s largest collections of looted and stolen cultural heritage, much of it acquired during Britain’s imperial expansion. While museums across Europe and North America are increasingly engaging with repatriation claims, the London institution continues to hide behind the British Museum Act of 1963. This domestic law prohibits trustees from permanently disposing of collections except in narrow circumstances, a convenient shield repeatedly invoked to block meaningful returns under the guise of acting in the “public good.”Similarly hypocritical is the museum’s loan policy, which refuses loans to exhibitions displaying stolen or illegally exported objects, while demanding guarantees — including immunity from judicial seizure — that any loaned object be returned. This stance is especially ironic for an institution long criticized for retaining and refusing to repatriate looted cultural objects.As a result, the British Museum has increasingly become the subject of outrage and ridicule: an international symbol of imperial privilege and institutional stubbornness, where visitors “feel at home” because looted objects from almost every corner of the world are on display.In its latest attempt to completely ignore societal progress — after hosting a tone-deaf gala earlier this year — the British Museum has now unveiled what its director, Nicholas Cullinan, called an \"innovative,\" \"new\" long-term loans program to “decolonize” its approach. As the inaugural loan under the new program, the British Museum sent 80 Greek and Egyptian antiquities to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) museum in Mumbai, India, last week. Cullinan told the Telegraph that the new model was “a much more positive one of collaboration rather than this kind of zero-sum, binary, all-or-nothing model that people put forward.” In reality, this model is neither new nor decolonial. It is a rebranding exercise that preserves colonial power structures while pretending to dismantle them.  “Cultural diplomacy, that’s what museums should do,” Cullinan added. “You don’t have to embarrass your own country to do something positive with another country.”Long-term loans are not restitution. They do not acknowledge historical wrongdoing, nor do they restore agency to source communities. Instead, they reinforce a museum’s claim of ownership over objects it has no moral (and often legal) right to possess. Under this model, formerly colonized nations must ask permission to temporarily access their own heritage, accept conditions dictated by a British institution, and bear the financial and logistical burdens of care, while the museum retains ultimate control.Decolonization cannot be conditional. It cannot operate on the assumption that Western institutions are the most competent custodians of non-Western heritage. Nor can it coexist with legal frameworks designed to protect the spoils of empire. A loan feigns generosity; restitution recognizes justice. The two are not interchangeable.If the British Museum were serious about decolonization, it would use its considerable influence to advocate for legislative change rather than clinging to outdated laws. It would collaborate with origin communities as equal partners, centring their voices in determining what should happen to their own cultural heritage, restoring access, agency, ownership, and interpretative authority. This requires a fundamental reimagining of the museum’s mission, prioritizing transparency, shared decision-making, and justice.The 21st century demands more than symbolic gestures and semantic gymnastics. It demands accountability. Until the British Museum confronts the realities of restitution, its claims of progress are just another carefully curated façade concealing an unresolved colonial legacy.\n                  \n                      \n                        Opinion\n                      \n                      \n                        British Museum\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

I remember feeling the swell of hope and possibility, thinking — Wow. Am I crazy, or does he maybe have a shot at this thing? He most certainly did. But now comes the real work: upholding that towering vision of transformative reform in all arenas — affordability, housing, education, and the arts. As musician and educator Sami Abu Shumays writes in a moving letter to the new administration about the role of government in arts funding, the city's Department of Cultural Affairs currently gives more money each year to the Metropolitan Museum of Art than it does to every cultural institution in Queens and Staten Island combined. As this year draws to a close, here’s hoping the next one heralds a more equitable and hopeful art world. —Lisa Yin Zhang, associate editor NYC Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani addressing his supporters after his historic victory on November 4, 2025.

Katherine Kelaidis reads this incident in the context of the larger question of whether explicitly Christian imagery should be part of European public spaces, and what form it should take. \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Launch a Community-Centered Design Career with an MDes From the University of ArkansasThe two-year, tuition-free Master of Design in Communication Design program blends studio-driven research, community engagement, and advanced design practice.\n                        \n                        \n                            Learn more\n                        \n                    \n            Lorin Duckman on Lisa Yin Zhang's \"The Trump Administration Looks Even Worse Up Close\":The images scared me, because these people who have the fate of the world in their hands, lack a love for humanity. No dignity. Just power. The photographer saw them for who they are and they saw him as a person with a camera. So goes our art.

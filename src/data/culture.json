    "body": "\n\tin Film, History |   \tDecember 16th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe youngest movie­go­ers today do not, of course, remem­ber a time before visu­al effects could be cre­at­ed dig­i­tal­ly. What may give us more pause is that, at this point in cin­e­ma his­to­ry, most of their par­ents don’t remem­ber it either. Con­sid­er the fact that Steven Spiel­berg’s Juras­sic Park, with its once impos­si­bly real­is­tic (and still whol­ly pass­able) CGI dinosaurs, came out 32 years ago. That may put it, we must acknowl­edge, into the realm of the “clas­sic,” the kind of pic­ture whose enter­tain­ment val­ue holds up despite — or because of — the qual­i­ties that fix it in its time. Equal­ly spec­tac­u­lar but longer-can­on­ized clas­sics pose a greater chal­lenge to the imag­i­na­tions of young view­ers, who can hard­ly guess how they could have been made “before com­put­ers.”\nAfter see­ing the notable exam­ples pro­vid­ed in the new Pri­mal Space video above, they’ll cer­tain­ly under­stand one thing: it was­n’t easy. Even a seem­ing­ly sim­ple effect like the pen float­ing loose through the zero-grav­i­ty cab­in in 2001: A Space Odyssey required no small degree of inge­nu­ity. We might nat­u­ral­ly assume that film­mak­ers in 1968 would have accom­plished it with a cou­ple of pieces of Scotch tape and fish­ing line, but that would have result­ed in unac­cept­able tan­gling prob­lems, to say noth­ing of the trick­i­ness of ensur­ing, quite lit­er­al­ly, that the strings did­n’t show. Instead, Kubrick­’s team end­ed up attach­ing the pen to a sheet of glass — metic­u­lous­ly cleaned, no doubt, to elim­i­nate the pos­si­bil­i­ty of streaks — large enough to occu­py the entire frame and thus go unno­ticed by the view­er. It was then slow­ly rotat­ed by a crank-turn­ing assis­tant.\nA few dif­fer­ent effects from 2001 come in for expla­na­tion through­out the course of the video, includ­ing the mul­ti­ple-expo­sure pho­tog­ra­phy that made pos­si­ble shots of space­craft pass­ing plan­ets as well as the psy­che­del­ic “Star Gate” sequence toward the end. Though some of the devices used in these process­es were put togeth­er just for the pro­duc­tion, the under­ly­ing tech­niques had already been evolv­ing for more than 60 years. Indeed, many were pio­neered by Georges Méliès, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture for A Trip to the Moon from 1902, the very first sci­ence-fic­tion film. This video goes behind the scenes of a work from the year before: L’Homme à la tête en caoutchouc, or The Man with the Rub­ber Head, in which Méliès man­aged a shot in which his own cra­ni­um inflates to huge pro­por­tions with­out the use of so much as a zoom lens.\nOth­er exam­ples, drawn from a range of beloved films from Metrop­o­lis to Mary Pop­pins, illus­trate the inven­tive­ness born of sheer tech­ni­cal lim­i­ta­tion in the days when film­mak­ing was a whol­ly ana­log affair. In some cas­es, the effects these pro­duc­tions pulled off with minia­tures, prisms, and mir­rors 60, 80, 100 years ago look as good as any­thing Hol­ly­wood puts on the screen today — or rather bet­ter, since the innate phys­i­cal­i­ty behind them makes them feel more “real.” Per­haps unsur­pris­ing­ly, this video’s arti­fi­cial-intel­li­gence course spon­sor makes ref­er­ence to the end­less range of visu­al pos­si­bil­i­ties avail­able to those who mas­ter that tech­nol­o­gy. And it’s not impos­si­ble that we now stand on the cusp of a rev­o­lu­tion in visu­al effects for that rea­son, with at least as much of an upside and down­side as CGI. If so, we should pre­pare our­selves to hear the ques­tion, from chil­dren born today, of how any­one ever made movies before AI.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow Georges Méliès A Trip to the Moon Became the First Sci-Fi Film & Changed Cin­e­ma For­ev­er (1902)\nThe Art of Cre­at­ing Spe­cial Effects in Silent Movies: Inge­nu­ity Before the Age of CGI\nThe 1927 Film Metrop­o­lis Cre­at­ed a Dystopi­an Vision of What the World Would Look Like in 2026–and It Hits Close to Home\nHow Stan­ley Kubrick Made 2001: A Space Odyssey: A Sev­en-Part Video Essay\nHow 2001: A Space Odyssey Became “the Hard­est Film Kubrick Ever Made”\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Real Any­more: A Close Look at Chang­ing Film­mak­ing Tech­niques\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Artificial Intelligence, History |   \tDecember 15th, 2025  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you want to know what it was like to live in sev­en­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don, read the diary of Samuel Pepys. While doing so, take note of his fre­quent ref­er­ences to the unclean­li­ness of the city’s streets: “very dirty and trou­ble­some to walk through,” “mighty dirty after the rain,” and dur­ing the large-scale rebuild­ing in the after­math of the Great Fire of 1666, “much built, yet very dirty and encum­bered.” If you want to know what it was like to live in nine­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don, read Charles Dick­ens. How­ev­er much-lament­ed the dif­fi­cul­ties it presents to young read­ers, the open­ing of Bleak House remains high­ly evoca­tive, set­ting the scene with “as much mud in the streets, as if the waters had but new­ly retired from the face of the earth,” “dogs, undis­tin­guish­able in mire, and “hors­es, scarce­ly bet­ter; splashed to their very blink­ers.”\nThis “mud,” an unspeak­ably foul admix­ture of sub­stances, only began to recede per­ma­nent­ly from Lon­don’s streets in the eigh­teen-fifties, after the instal­la­tion of sew­er sys­tems. So nor­mal for so long, its pres­ence would hard­ly have been down­played by the city’s observers back then, whether they record­ed their obser­va­tions on the page or on the can­vas.\nEven the painter’s ide­al­iz­ing impulse could only do so much, as evi­denced by some of the shots includ­ed in the new video tour of eigh­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don from Majes­tic Stu­dios above. Turn­ing con­tem­po­rary paint­ings and engrav­ings into cin­e­mat­ic ani­ma­tions with arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence-gen­er­at­ed video, it offers the next best thing to actu­al footage of the city as it would have been seen by the likes of Jonathan Swift, Samuel John­son, Thomas Gains­bor­ough, and Mary Woll­stonecraft.\nSev­en­teenth-cen­tu­ry Lon­don was the cul­tur­al and com­mer­cial cen­ter of Geor­gian Eng­land, but also a city well on its way to becom­ing the cen­ter of the world. Some of its famous sights seen here in their eigh­teenth-cen­tu­ry urban con­text include St. Paul’s Cathe­dral by Sir Christo­pher Wren, mas­ter­mind of the city’s post-Great Fire recon­struc­tion; the old Lon­don Bridge, still lined with hous­es and shops; St. James’s Square after its trans­for­ma­tion from a state once con­sid­ered “mud­dy, neglect­ed, and frankly, embar­rass­ing for such pres­ti­gious address­es”; and the Tow­er of Lon­don on the bank of the Riv­er Thames. As for the riv­er itself, it hard­ly goes ignored by the works of art that shape this video, or indeed un-glo­ri­fied by them. But if you know any­thing about its con­di­tion before the turn of the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, you’ll be relieved that AI can’t yet restore its smell.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Growth of Lon­don, from the Romans to the 21st Cen­tu­ry, Visu­al­ized in a Time-Lapse Ani­mat­ed Map\nTake a Vir­tu­al Tour of Shakespeare’s Globe The­atre in Lon­don\nThe Evo­lu­tion of Lon­don: 2,000 Years of Change Ani­mat­ed in 7 Min­utes\nThe Old­est Known Footage of Lon­don (1890–1920) Fea­tures the City’s Great Land­marks\nHear the Evo­lu­tion of the Lon­don Accent Over 660 Years: From 1346 to 2006\nThe Sights & Sounds of 18th-Cen­tu­ry Paris Get Recre­at­ed with 3D Audio and Ani­ma­tion\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Music |   \tDecember 15th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nOver the decades, Tom Jones has per­formed with the best of them. In 1969, we can find him singing “Long Time Gone” with Cros­by, Stills, Nash & Young, and tak­ing them delight­ful­ly by sur­prise. The same goes for his duet with Janis Joplin in that same year. Now fast for­ward to the 1990s. In this decade, Jones teamed up with the Swedish rock band The Cardi­gans and per­formed a rol­lick­ing ver­sion of the Talk­ing Heads “Burn­ing Down the House.” And, rather unex­pect­ed­ly, he would get paired with Pink Floy­d’s David Gilmour and croon Prince’s “Pur­ple Rain.”\nThe record­ing above comes from Jones’ show The Right Time, a six-episode tele­vi­sion series that aired in 1992. Trac­ing the evo­lu­tion of pop music, the show fea­tured appear­ances by Bob Geld­of, Cyn­di Lau­per, The Chief­tains and Ste­vie Won­der. When it comes to his ver­sion of “Pur­ple Rain,” don’t miss the Gilmour solo mid­way through.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThere’s always something a little bit unsettling about Sabrina Bockler’s dynamic paintings, although it can sometimes take a moment to narrow down the reason why. At first glance, a table appears sumptuously set, or a floral scene unfolds with brilliant hues. Upon further inspection, we’ll notice a two-headed goose, a table of food being ravaged by cats and dogs, or the disquieting feeling you’re being watched.\nBockler combines glowy, Rococo-esque figures with elements of Dutch Golden Age painting, specifically still-lifes that incorporate tables full of flowers, dead game, and decomposing fruit. She also taps into romance, allegory, and the hunting genre, portraying dogs leaping after prey or fighting with one another over scraps.\n“Through the Glass Darkly”\nA sense of chaos is always present in Bockler’s maximalist paintings, but to varying degrees. “Through the Glass Darkly,” for example, teeters on the edge of strangeness, depicting a seemingly calm tablescape with vessels full of wine interspersed among peonies, fruit, and fish. And yet, in the vein of traditional vanitas paintings, an abandoned open pomegranate suggests things are not as ideal as they seem. The plated fish stare blankly at the viewer, and mysteriously disembodied eyes peer through glasses of wine.\nIn other works, like “Beg, Borrow, and Steal,” which is currently on view in the group exhibition Symposium at Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery in West Palm Beach, “disorder” only begins to describe the anarchic scene of dogs and cats in a frenzy over a table of produce, flowers, seafood, and meat. As much as we associate these lavish scenes with refinement and wealth, there is also a disquieting undercurrent that at times bubbles up to the surface in the form of unnaturalness or even pure mania.\nBockler’s work, including a few of the pieces seen below, will go on view at Beers London in the artist’s solo exhibition titled Impending Rapture, which runs from January 15 to February 28. See more on Bockler’s website and Instagram.\n“Beg, Borrow, and Steal”\n“Trophy”\nDetail of “Through the Glass Darkly”\n“In Bloom”\n“Divine Meddling”\nDetail of “Divine Meddling”\n“Plucked”\n“Leftovers”\n“Solstice”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nWhen we see a painting, we don’t generally ask ourselves, “Is this art?” A work on canvas is almost always inherently seen as such, but what about mediums like ceramics, photography, or fiber that also often serve functional or decorative purposes and historically have not been considered “high art?” Why are some textiles considered art while others are not, and what system are we using to determine this “value?” What makes a tapestry a tapestry, and a rug a rug?\nThread Count, a large-scale group exhibition curated by Charlotte Grüssing at The Hole, aims to illuminate the beguiling nature of textiles—something of a dark horse in the contemporary art world. The show is organized as an ode to the work of trailblazing artist Anni Albers, a modernist weaver who studied at the Bauhaus in Germany and later taught alongside her husband, Josef Albers, at Black Mountain College in North Carolina.\nSarah Zapata, “Towards An Ominous Time V B” (2022), handwoven cloth, natural and synthetic fibers, 72 x 60 inches\nThread Count, the title for which nods to the number we often see on bedsheet sets to indicate quality, brings together work by more than two dozen contemporary artists working with fabric and fiber.\n“Fiber practices may be having a cultural moment, yet they remain widely misunderstood,” the gallery says. “Thread Count invites a slower kind of looking: attention to surface, texture, knots, dyes and the physical logic of how things are built.” The show serves as a reminder, despite the rise of textiles in modern and contemporary art, “of how inadequate such quality measurements are for describing the complexity of textile work.”\nThe artists each approach fabric, thread, rope, dyes, and found objects with a huge array of techniques. Kenny Nguyen, for example, creates undulating large-scale wall pieces made of woven strips of silk, and Rachel Mica Weiss creates stunning color gradients by stretching thin embroidery thread taut within a frame. Molly Haynes’ tight, structural weavings also emphasize the material characteristics of silk and cotton thread—individual strands of which may seem inconsequential, but woven and wrapped together into chunky textures, they transform into an intimately detailed object.\nThread Count also highlights the work of artists for whom textiles are a conduit for powerful imagery, a kind of cross-pollination between fiber art, painting, and even digital processes. Qualeasha Wood, for example, creates digital collages which are then woven with a jacquard loom. Jim Drain’s sculptural form evokes a lidded basket, incorporating knitting. And Samantha Bittman’s meticulously rendered geometric compositions, augmented with acrylic, evoke Op Art of the 1960s.\nQualeasha Wood, “Peep Show” (2023), woven jacquard and glass seed beads, 80 x 56 inches\nColossal readers will also likely be familiar with Sarah Zapata’s textural, tufted surfaces and Antonio Santín’s hyperrealistic oil paintings that resemble scrunched carpets. You may also recognize work by Jacqueline Surdell, Anne Samat, and more.\nSee Thread Count in New York City at The Hole’s Bowery location through January 11.

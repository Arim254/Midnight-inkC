    "body": "\n\tin History |   \tDecember 22nd, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nHow­ev­er cel­e­brat­ed by his­to­ri­ans, scru­ti­nized by archae­ol­o­gists, and descend­ed-upon by tourists it may be, Pom­peii is not excep­tion­al — not even in the fate of hav­ing been buried in ash by Mount Vesu­vius in the year 76, which also hap­pened to the near­by town of Her­cu­la­neum. Rather, it is the sheer ordi­nar­i­ness of that medi­um-sized provin­cial Roman city that we most val­ue today, inad­ver­tent­ly pre­served as it was by that vol­canic dis­as­ter. The new Lost in Time video above recon­structs Pom­peii as it must have looked at the very end of its days, tak­ing a look at every­thing from its homes to its aque­ducts, its forum to its basil­i­ca, and its wine and per­fume pro­duc­tion facil­i­ties to its glad­i­a­to­r­i­al are­na.\nUnsur­pris­ing­ly, the Amphithe­atre of Pom­peii is much small­er than the Colos­se­um. But it was actu­al­ly built 140 years ear­li­er, at a time when local lead­ers across the empire were already start­ing to feel that any self-respect­ing Roman town ought to have its own venue for spec­ta­cles involv­ing one-on-one com­bat, feats of ath­leti­cism, exot­ic ani­mals, and even pub­lic exe­cu­tions.\nThe same ulti­mate­ly went for all the types of facil­i­ties unearthed in the entombed city’s pub­lic spaces and pri­vate homes alike, includ­ing baths, snack bars, and din­ing rooms. To that extent, Pom­peii had it all, even if life there lacked the poten­tial for advance­ment and intrigue offered only by the Eter­nal City.\nAs the video gives its tour of a still-thriv­ing Pom­peii, it counts down to the erup­tion of Vesu­vius, which last­ed about two days. “Why did­n’t peo­ple leave the city?” asks the nar­ra­tor. “His­to­ri­ans claim that about 2,000 peo­ple lost their lives in Pom­peii that day, mean­ing about 10,000 man­aged to escape.” It is to the writ­ings of one such escapee, Pliny the Younger, that we owe much of what we know about the expe­ri­ence of the cat­a­stro­phe itself — and to cen­turies of exam­i­na­tion since its redis­cov­ery as an archae­o­log­i­cal site that we have the kind of knowl­edge about the place that goes into a recon­struc­tion like this one. Those efforts have fed our under­stand­ing of life in the ancient world as a whole, for in its after­life, Pom­peii has become not just a medi­um-sized provin­cial Roman city, but the medi­um-sized provin­cial Roman city.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch the Destruc­tion of Pom­peii by Mount Vesu­vius, Re-Cre­at­ed with Com­put­er Ani­ma­tion (79 AD)\nTake a High Def, Guid­ed Tour of Pom­peii\nBehold 3D Recre­ations of Pompeii’s Lav­ish Homes–As They Exist­ed Before the Erup­tion of Mount Vesu­vius\nThe Last Morn­ing in Pom­peii & The Night Pom­peii Died: A New Video Series Explores the End of the Doomed Roman City\nThe Only Writ­ten Eye-Wit­ness Account of Pompeii’s Destruc­tion: Hear Pliny the Younger’s Let­ters on the Mount Vesu­vius Erup­tion\nThe Only Writ­ten Eye-Wit­ness Account of Pompeii’s Destruc­tion: Hear Pliny the Younger’s Let­ters on the Mount Vesu­vius Erup­tion\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nSurreal Salon, the annual international exhibition celebrating the Pop-surrealism/Lowbrow movement, is returning to Baton Rouge Gallery – center for contemporary art (BRG) for its 18th year. Held in partnership with Louisiana State University (LSU)’s School of Art, the show will be open to all at no cost from January 2 to 25, 2026, in Louisiana’s capital city. \nThis year’s multimedia edition features more than 60 artists from the U.S. and abroad, with pieces hand-picked by the show’s Special Guest Juror, Swoon, from a pool of nearly 800 works via a blind jurying process. \nEvery year, Surreal Salon celebrates the ever-evolving Pop-surrealist/Lowbrow art movement by inviting artists across the globe to submit works for consideration. The resulting selection always features paintings, photography, ceramics, textiles, mixed media works, and more. \nKristin Meyers, “Silenced,” mixed media and found objects, 25 x 16 x 11 inches\nOver the years, Surreal Salon has enlisted internationally renowned artists such as Ron English, Camille Rose Garcia, Marco Mazzoni, Beth Cavener, Greg “Craola” Simkins, and many others to serve as jurors and curate engaging, dynamic collections of work for the show. That tradition was renewed in 2026 as Swoon (a.k.a. Caledonia Curry) stepped into this role.\nCurry is a Brooklyn-based street artist who, drawing on both realistic and fantastical elements, has created immersive installations, wheatpaste portraits, and community-based social justice projects for two decades. Her work has adorned the walls of institutions like New York’s Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and Tate Modern, while also appearing on the façades of built environments around the world.\nSwoon will give a talk on Monday, January 26, hosted by LSU’s School of Art in conjunction with Surreal Salon 18. Free and open to all, the talk will touch on her career, her work, and her experience selecting the art for this show. \nBefore the exhibition’s closure, BRG will welcome hundreds of guests to channel their own pop-surrealist visions into elaborate costumes at The Surreal Salon Soiree on Saturday, January 24. The night will celebrate the show with live music from the band Bon Bon Vivant, two different DJ sets, food trucks, and several surprises. Tickets are on sale now, starting at just $40.\nTo learn more and to preview the works included in this year’s exhibition, visit batonrougegallery.org.\nPaige DeVries, “Shadow Boxer,” oil on canvas, 60 x 40 inches\nPeyton Pickenpaugh, “Medusa,” fabric, foam, pins, 57 x 46 x 18 inches\nPrimary graphic for Surreal Salon 18 created by artist Marco Mazzoni\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

The project, called “Apartamento Varanda,” reimagines a modernist residence, originally constructed in 1962, with contemporary details that nod to its decades-old spirit while incorporating a particularly organic element in the form of lots and lots of plants.\nDraped from rafters or bespoke frameworks, Brazilian botanicals create a green oasis indoors. What Requena describes as a “true urban forest” is then complemented by a range of iconic furnishings from both modernist and contemporary eras.

But now comes the real work: upholding that towering vision of transformative reform in all arenas — affordability, housing, education, and the arts. As musician and educator Sami Abu Shumays writes in a moving letter to the new administration about the role of government in arts funding, the city's Department of Cultural Affairs currently gives more money each year to the Metropolitan Museum of Art than it does to every cultural institution in Queens and Staten Island combined.

    "body": "\n\tThe Trump administration turned up the pressure in its ongoing battle with the Smithsonian Institution, a museum network that the President has repeatedly taken to task for the way it represents the diversity of American history and culture in its exhibitions and displays.\n\n\tAccording to the Washington Post, the administration has now threatened to withhold funding from the Smithsonian as its museums face a content review. \n\n\tSmithsonian secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III had previously promised to submit to that review while also maintaining the network’s independence from the government. But per the Post, Russell Vought and Vince Haley, respectively the budget director for the White House and the director of the Domestic Policy Council, have now alleged that the Smithsonian hasn’t moved quickly enough to turn over all the documents and information for that review.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tIn an email to Bunch that was obtained by the Post, Vought and Haley cited a prior executive order by Donald Trump in which he claimed that the Smithsonian had advanced “corrosive ideology” by claiming that the United States is “inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.” In that order, Trump demanded that the White House only “prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race.”\n\n\tThat order marked the beginning of a rough period for the Smithsonian that has seen artworks targeted and exhibitions reviewed by the White House. Trump also claimed to have fired the director of the National Portrait Gallery, a Smithsonian-run museum, before she resigned soon after. Soon after, painter Amy Sherald canceled her planned show at that institution, claiming the museum suggested that she remove a painting of a Black trans woman from it.\n\n\tVought and Haley claimed that what the Smithsonian sent over “fell far short of what was requested.” The Post reported that the Smithsonian has a January 13 deadline to submit all necessary exhibition descriptions, materials related to forthcoming exhibitions, and more.\n\n\tThey reportedly addressed the Smithsonian’s planned programming for America’s 250th anniversary in particular, writing, “We wish to be assured that none of the leadership of the Smithsonian museums is confused about the fact that the United States has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world.” Vought and Haley said the public would have “no patience” for exhibitions that do not present what they called “a positive view of American history.”\n\t\n\n\tIn response, Bunch reportedly wrote that the Smithsonian was still “committed to sharing information and data.” He claimed that the government shutdown had slowed efforts to gather everything, adding that the Smithsonian “would be pleased to meet and share an update on our internal efforts to review and update our content.”\n\n\tFederal money is a lifeline for the Smithsonian, which receives about 62 percent of its funding from the government. Still, even if the White House defunds the Smithsonian, the museum network can still receive money in the form of “gifts, revenue-generating activities, and investments,” according to its website.\n\n\tAlthough the Smithsonian gains so much money from the government, it is not officially a state-run museum. According to the Post, Bunch once again affirmed the Smithsonian’s independence in an email to Vought and Haley, writing that “all content, programming, and curatorial decisions are made by the Smithsonian.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tRobert Mnuchin, the Wall Street pioneer who became one of New York’s most respected art dealers and a fixture at blue-chip auctions, died on Friday at his home in Bridgewater, Connecticut. He was 92. His death, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by his stepdaughter, Lisa Hedley Wick. \n\n\tMnuchin was unusual in having two long and highly successful careers. At Goldman Sachs, he was a central figure in the rise of block trading in the 1960s and ’70s, helping build the firm’s institutional equities business under managing partner Gustave Levy. By 1978, the Wall Street Journal described him as “the acknowledged dean of block traders,” rivaled only by Salomon Brothers’ Michael Bloomberg. His skill on the trading floor—an encyclopedic recall of buyers and sellers, an instinct for pressure and timing—made him a legend inside the firm. He became a partner in 1967, co-headed trading and arbitrage by 1976, and joined the firm’s powerful management committee in 1980. He retired in 1990. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThat same set of instincts—competitive, analytic, and deeply interpersonal—animated his second act. After decades on Wall Street, Mnuchin did something that surprised even close friends: he left finance to open a gallery. It was not a move financiers of his stature typically made. As he later told ARTnews, it “took a lot of courage” to step away from the Goldman machine and test whether his success came from his own abilities or the institution behind him. “I wanted to see what I could do on my own,” he recalled. And because no museum would hire someone without a formal art background, “the only alternative was to start my own gallery, which is what I did.” \n\n\tHe and his wife, Adriana, converted part of their East 78th Street townhouse into C&M Arts (partnering with James Corcoran) in 1992, later partnering, with Dominique Levy in L&M Arts. He would establish Mnuchin Gallery, on his own, in 2013. From the start, the gallery had a clear identity: rigorous, museum-quality exhibitions focusing on the pillars of postwar American art—Pollock, Rothko, Kline, de Kooning—as well as major presentations of Alexander Calder, Donald Judd, Jeff Koons, Frank Stella, Philip Guston, Sam Gilliam, Ed Clark, and David Hammons. He staged eight exhibitions devoted to Willem de Kooning alone, calling the artist “Picasso-esque” for the breadth of his distinct periods. \n\t\n\n\tMnuchin’s passion for exhibitions—and his conviction that art should be lived with—shaped both his gallery and his own collecting. “The reason to buy art is because you love it, you love it, you love it,” he told the New York Times in 2013. He disliked the term “collection,” insisting that he and his wife kept everything they bought in their home, never in storage. \n\n\tHe became equally known for his presence in the auction room. At evening sales, he was a calm but relentless bidder—sometimes shouting out prices or jumping ahead in increments to secure a work. In 2019, wearing a cream-colored jacket and armed with a flip phone, he set a record for a living artist when he placed the winning $91.1 million bid for Jeff Koons’s Rabbit (1986), acting on behalf of an anonymous client widely believed to be hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen. His bidding style—patient, unshowy, decisive—made him a recognizable figure even for those who didn’t know his long résumé. \n\n\tThough he was the father of Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, Robert Mnuchin largely avoided politics and was described by colleagues as modest, disciplined, and deeply devoted to art. Friends and art-world peers often noted his integrity: Amy Cappellazzo, the former Sotheby’s chairman, once called him “one of the straightest shooters in the business.” \n\t\n\n\tRobert Elliott Mnuchin was born on September 5, 1933, in Manhattan. His father, Leon A. Mnuchin, was a lawyer and longtime director at several retail companies. The family collected works by Franz Kline and Mark Rothko—and, as he liked to note, once owned a forged Matisse. He grew up on Central Park West before the family moved to Scarsdale. He attended Scarsdale High School, graduated from Yale in 1955, and served briefly in the Army before joining Goldman Sachs. \n\n\tMnuchin married Elaine Terner in 1957; they had two sons, Steven and Alan. After their divorce, he married Adriana Graber, with whom he had a daughter, Valerie. In addition to his wife, daughter, and sons, he is survived by his stepchildren Lisa Hedley Wick and Bradley Abelow. \n\n\tMnuchin worked well into his later years, even as he faced mobility challenges. He skipped Art Basel in Basel for the first time in two decades in 2019, but continued to remain at the gallery’s exhibitions and for major sales. “I love what I do,” he said in the 2021 ARTnews interview. “I’d be lost without it.” \n",

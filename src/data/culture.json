    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImages cour­tesy of the Library of Con­gress.\nActor George Takei was once best known as Star Trek’s Mr. Sulu. He still is, of course, but over the last cou­ple decades his friend­ly, intel­li­gent, and wicked­ly fun­ny pres­ence on social media has land­ed him a new pop­u­lar role as a civ­il lib­er­ties advo­cate. Takei’s activist pas­sion is informed not only by his sta­tus as a gay man, but also by his child­hood expe­ri­ences. At the age of 5, Takei was round­ed up with his Amer­i­can-born par­ents and tak­en to a Japan­ese intern­ment camp in Arkansas, where he would live for the next three years. In an inter­view with Democ­ra­cy Now, Takei spoke frankly about this his­to­ry:\nWe’re Amer­i­cans…. We had noth­ing to do with the war. We sim­ply hap­pened to look like the peo­ple that bombed Pearl Har­bor. But with­out charges, with­out tri­al, with­out due process—the fun­da­men­tal pil­lar of our jus­tice system—we were sum­mar­i­ly round­ed up, all Japan­ese Amer­i­cans on the West Coast, where we were pri­mar­i­ly res­i­dent, and sent off to 10 barb wire intern­ment camps—prison camps, real­ly, with sen­try tow­ers, machine guns point­ed at us—in some of the most des­o­late places in this coun­try.\nTakei and his fam­i­ly were among over 100,000 Japanese-Americans—over half of whom were U.S. cit­i­zens—interned in such camps.\n\nInto one of these camps, Man­za­nar, locat­ed in the foothills of the Sier­ra Nevadas, cel­e­brat­ed pho­tog­ra­ph­er Ansel Adams man­aged to gain entrance through his friend­ship with the war­den. Adams took over 200 pho­tographs of life inside the camp.\nIn 1965, he donat­ed his col­lec­tion to the Library of Con­gress, writ­ing in a let­ter, “The pur­pose of my work was to show how these peo­ple, suf­fer­ing under a great injus­tice, and loss of prop­er­ty, busi­ness and pro­fes­sions, had over­come the sense of defeat and dis­pair [sic] by build­ing for them­selves a vital com­mu­ni­ty in an arid (but mag­nif­i­cent) envi­ron­ment.”\n\nAdams had anoth­er pur­pose as well—as schol­ar of the peri­od Frank H. Wu describes it—“to doc­u­ment some aspects of the intern­ment camp that the gov­ern­ment didn’t want to have shown.” These include “the barbed wire, and the guard tow­ers, and the armed sol­diers.” Pro­hib­it­ed from doc­u­ment­ing these con­trol mech­a­nisms direct­ly, the pho­tog­ra­ph­er “cap­tured them in the back­ground, in shad­ows,” says Wu: “In some of the pho­tos when you look you can see just faint­ly that he’s tak­ing a pho­to of some­thing, but in front of the pho­to you can see barbed wire, or on the ground you can see the shad­ow of barbed wire. Some of the pho­tos even show the blur­ry out­line of a soldier’s shad­ow.”\n\nThe pho­tographs doc­u­ment the dai­ly activ­i­ties of the internees—their work and leisure rou­tines, and their strug­gles to main­tain some sem­blance of nor­mal­cy while liv­ing in hasti­ly con­struct­ed bar­racks in the harsh­est of con­di­tions.\n\nThough the land­scape, and its cli­mate, could be des­o­late and unfor­giv­ing, it was also, as Adams couldn’t help but notice, “mag­nif­i­cent.” The col­lec­tion includes sev­er­al wide shots of stretch­es of moun­tain range and sky, often with pris­on­ers star­ing off long­ing­ly into the dis­tance. But the major­i­ty of the pho­tos are of the internees—men, women, and chil­dren, often in close-up por­traits that show them look­ing var­i­ous­ly hope­ful, hap­py, sad­dened, and resigned.\n\nYou can view the entire col­lec­tion at the Library of Con­gress’ online cat­a­log. Adams also pub­lished about 65 of the pho­tographs in a book titled Born Free and Equal: The Sto­ry of Loy­al Japan­ese Amer­i­cans in 1944. The col­lec­tion rep­re­sents an impor­tant part of Adams’ work dur­ing the peri­od. But more impor­tant­ly, it rep­re­sents events in U.S. his­to­ry that should nev­er be for­got­ten or denied.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Dis­ney Fought Fas­cism with Pro­pa­gan­da Car­toons Dur­ing World War II & Avert­ed Finan­cial Col­lapse\nDr. Seuss’ World War II Pro­pa­gan­da Films: Your Job in Ger­many (1945) and Our Job in Japan (1946)\nAnsel Adams Reveals His Cre­ative Process in 1958 Doc­u­men­tary\nDis­cov­er Ansel Adams’ 226 Pho­tos of U.S. Nation­al Parks (and Anoth­er Side of the Leg­endary Pho­tog­ra­ph­er)\nDr. Seuss Draws Anti-Japan­ese Car­toons Dur­ing WWII, Then Atones with Hor­ton Hears a Who!\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture, History |   \tNovember 24th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nNew York isn’t the old­est city in the Unit­ed States of Amer­i­ca, and it cer­tain­ly isn’t the newest. But it is, quite pos­si­bly, the Amer­i­can city where more lay­ers of his­to­ry coex­ist than any oth­er, a qual­i­ty that man­i­fests most vivid­ly in its built envi­ron­ment. Even the most casu­al tourist can sense the sheer vari­ety of time peri­ods embod­ied in the build­ings around them on, say, a stroll down Broad­way — one of the streets fea­tured in the ten-part walk­ing tour com­piled in the new Archi­tec­tur­al Digest video above. As a whole, it offers a two-hour jour­ney through the city begin­ning in Cen­tral Park and end­ing on Wall Street.\nIn between come on-foot exam­i­na­tions of every­thing from the fin-de-siè­cle “apart­ment hotels” of the Upper West Side to the recent­ly built “super-tall” res­i­den­tial tow­ers of West 57th Street to the devel­op­ments atop the buried Grand Cen­tral Sta­tion to the dis­used indus­tri­al rail­way now known — and imi­tat­ed around the world — as a lin­ear park called the High Line. \nTend though long­time New York­ers may to regard each part of the city as more or less a nation unto itself, a per­spec­tive with a bit more dis­tance reveals signs of the nev­er-end­ing social, eco­nom­ic, and aes­thet­ic exchange between them: an impor­tant fac­tor in how the use of and role played by even the city’s most august struc­tures has been sub­ject to change after unan­tic­i­pat­ed change.\nHelp­ing us to under­stand all this are archi­tects Michael Wyet­zn­er and Nick Potts, both pro­fes­sion­al­ly well placed to explain both the big pic­ture of New York’s evo­lu­tion and the sig­nif­i­cance of the var­i­ous odd­i­ties and eccen­tric­i­ties on its streets. Even an archi­tec­tur­al lay­man would take impressed notice while pass­ing, say, the man­sions once inhab­it­ed by Alexan­der Hamil­ton and Aaron Burr; the jagged bunker that has housed the Whit­ney Muse­um of Amer­i­can Art, the Met Breuer, and Frick Madi­son; the impos­si­bly skin­ny-look­ing sky­scrap­ers of the so-called “Bil­lion­aire’s Row”; or the Dako­ta, John Lennon’s final res­i­dence. But to learn what such build­ings have to tell us about the his­to­ry and nature of New York, we must look at them, as anoth­er famous rock star once sang, thru’ these archi­tects’ eyes.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe Lost Neigh­bor­hood Buried Under New York City’s Cen­tral Park\nA Whirl­wind Archi­tec­tur­al Tour of the New York Pub­lic Library — “Hid­den Details” and All\nArchi­tect Breaks Down the Design Of Four Icon­ic New York City Muse­ums: the Met, MoMA, Guggen­heim & Frick\nEvery Hid­den Detail of New York’s Clas­sic Sky­scrap­ers: The Chrysler, Empire State & Wool­worth Build­ings\nA Walk­ing Tour of Los Ange­les Archi­tec­ture: From Art Deco to Cal­i­for­nia Bun­ga­low\nA 5‑Hour Walk­ing Tour of Paris and Its Famous Streets, Mon­u­ments & Parks\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nCombining hand-carved Japanese cypress with crystal-clear acrylic resin, Ayako Kita sculpts tender, emotive figures. For her current exhibition, The End of the Day Begins at FUMA Contemporary Tokyo, she focuses on the transitional moment of returning home, in which seemingly mundane tasks like switching on a light or opening a curtain are imbued with consequence, frozen in time.\nKita’s work emphasizes an often introspective world, where a young woman or girl’s consciousness, emotions, and anxieties manifest in uncanny scenarios. The titles usually offer important clues, too. In “me & me,” for example, an extra pair of legs is literally tethered to the character’s own limbs, as if another half-formed parallel version of her person is always present. And change is in the air in “Premonition,” where a slightly apprehensive expression is accompanied by a gust of wind.\n“Premonition” (2022), Japanese cypress and acrylic resin, 29 x 17 x 11 centimeters\nIn her most recent work, the figures exhibit expressions of curiosity, thoughtfulness, and faint concern, gazing directly at the viewer, as if seeing us unexpectedly across a room or out a window. “When I began to think about creating a world in which all the pieces would connect as one continuous story, this series naturally came to mind,” Kita says in a statement.\nThe End of the Day Begins includes works the artist has made throughout the past five years. Her newest pieces combine figures with furnishings and architectural elements, a theme she first explored when she was a student. “Rather than a return to my origins, this production became a time to reaffirm that these scenes still exist vividly within me,” she says.\nThe End of the Day Begins continues through November 29 in Tokyo.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nTechnology is always changing, quickly becoming dated or even obsolete as new updates are released. Remember LaserDiscs? What about 8-tracks? For Japanese musical trio Open Reel Ensemble, analog contraptions meet digital combinations to make unique and experimental sounds. Using reel-to-reel recorders from the 1970s and 1980s as musical instruments, the stage and studio setup is just as interesting as the recordings.\nTo achieve mesmerizing and ethereal tunes like “Tape Bowing Ensemble,” the group attaches bows to the analog tape wound around a reel, and they’ve been known to strum the tape like a guitar, tap suspended lengths with drumsticks, or spin reels like DJ turntables. Open Reel Ensemble uses multi-track recorders to gather the sounds, which can then be separated or layered during performances.\n\n\n\nDelving into a nostalgic technology, the group describes their hybrid contraptions and techniques as “magnetic folklore instruments. They tap into a sense of nostalgia for reel-to-reel, also known as magnetic tapes. They’ve described their genre as “Magnetikpunk.”\nOpen Reel Ensemble has performed during several of Issey Miyake’s fashion shows in Paris and continues to play at international festivals. Hear more on the group’s YouTube channel and website.\nYou might also enjoy ensemble member Ei Wada’s work under the moniker Electronicos Fantasticos.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nAlma Allen (photo by Ana Hop, courtesy American Arts Conservancy)\nAlma Allen, a Utah-born sculptor living in Mexico, will represent the United States at the 2026 Venice Biennale following several setbacks in the selection process for the 61st iteration of the event, the US Department of State announced today, November 24.\nAllen’s pavilion, the Department of State said, will feature “site-responsive” sculptures that “explore the concept of ‘elevation’ … as a physical manifestation of form and as a symbol of collective optimism and self-realization, furthering the Trump Administration’s focus on showcasing American excellence.”\nAllen’s selection for the international art competition marks the culmination of a chaotic selection cycle complicated by President Trump’s new guidelines for artists, including restrictions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and a mandate to promote “American exceptionalism.” \nIn an interview with the New York Times, Allen alleged that his two former representing galleries, Olney Gleason and Mendes Wood DM, asked him not to take the commission and dropped him from their rosters after he accepted. \nBoth galleries confirmed to Hyperallergic that they are no longer representing Allen, but declined to comment on whether the artist’s commission played a role in their decision to part ways.\n”Alma Allen has a singular artistic practice and we are happy to see him receive this recognition, especially after working with him for so many years at Kasmin,” said Nicholas Olney of Olney Gleason, the new gallery he co-founded following Kasmin’s closure. “While Olney Gleason does not represent Alma, we wish him all the best.”\nLuiz Guilherme Rodrigues, associate director of Communications at Mendes Wood DM, said, “We are not currently working with Alma Allen, and we don’t have any involvement in or information about his current or future projects.”\nTitled “Alma Allen: Call Me the Breeze,” the pavilion is organized by its commissioner, Jodi Parido of the American Arts Conservancy, and curated by Jeffrey Uslip, former deputy director of exhibitions at the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis. \nCameroonian curator Koyo Kouoh was originally tapped to oversee the pavilion last year under the Biden administration, and was slated to become the first African woman to do so. However, the position became vacant when Kouoh died suddenly earlier this year. \nUslip resigned from his post at the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis in 2016 after the institution reportedly faced accusations of racial insensitivity associated with a Kelley Walker exhibition he had curated. Protesters had called for Uslip’s dismissal and for a public boycott of the museum over the exhibition, which featured images of police brutality toward Black individuals, with some photographs smeared in chocolate and toothpaste.  \nAllen told the Times that he had not applied to the commission and that Uslip had approached him with an offer. Traditionally, artists are asked to submit a formal proposal. The artist and curator had never met before, and Allen said he accepted the offer quickly.\nHyperallergic has contacted Uslip and Allen for comment.\nAllen, who lives and works out of Tepoztlán uses stone, wood, and bronze to create biomorphic sculptures, sometimes sourcing materials from quarries near his studio in Mexico. His works are in the collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Palm Springs Art Museum, among others.\nNew York City-based sculptor Robert Lazzarini and curator John Ravenal were originally eyed by the Trump Department of State for the festival, according to the Washington Post, but a funding agreement with a third party reportedly collapsed, and the commission fell through before it was made official. \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhiladelphia Art Museum's campus (photo by Rob Cusick, courtesy the museum)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nThe administrative whirlwind at the Philadelphia Art Museum (PhAM) continues. After former Director and CEO Alexandra “Sasha” Suda filed a complaint accusing the museum of unlawful termination, PhAM is countering with its own legal filing, alleging that Suda misappropriated thousands of dollars in museum funds.\nOn November 20, the museum filed a petition with the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to shift the conflict out of the courts and into the hands of a confidential arbitrator. The move was in response to Suda’s lawsuit against the museum on November 10, six days after she was terminated. Last week, PhAM announced that former Metropolitan Museum of Art leader Daniel Weiss would be its next director and CEO. \nIn her complaint, Suda claimed that a “small, corrupt faction of the [museum] board” had commissioned an external law firm to conduct a “sham investigation” into her expenses and recommended her resignation. But the museum’s motion alleges that between March 2024 and July 2025, Suda awarded herself three unauthorized salary increases without disclosure or approval. \nIn a statement to Hyperallergic, a PhAM spokesperson confirmed that the museum filed the petition in response to Suda’s claims and declined to comment further. \nLuke Nikas, Suda’s lawyer, said in an emailed statement to Hyperallergic that “the motion, as well as its false narrative, fits the Museum’s longstanding pattern of trying to cover up its misconduct and mistreatment of staff.” \n“We expected the Museum would prefer to hide the sordid details about its unlawful treatment of Sasha Suda in a confidential arbitration,” Nikas continued. “If the Museum had nothing to hide, it would not be afraid to litigate in state court where we filed the case.”\nSuda accused the museum of unlawful termination and multiple employment agreement violations and is seeking two years of severance pay at her contracted salary rate ($720,000 annually), alleging that she was dismissed “without valid basis.” \nThe museum, however, argues that she was terminated “for cause” and is not entitled to severance pay as the external investigation concluded that she engaged in “dishonesty, misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty as the Director or fraud.”\nSuda had negotiated her starting salary at PhAM to be $720,000, the museum petition said, and the board explicitly noted that “absent extraordinary performance, she would not receive any additional increase in her compensation during the contract term.” Although the compensation committee denied Suda’s multiple requests for pay increases between 2023 and 2025, she awarded herself two unauthorized pay bumps effective in March and July 2024, respectively, the petition alleged. Suda never disclosed these increases, which included a third that was allegedly instituted this July, PhAM added. The museum’s petition also accuses Suda of unilaterally approving pay bumps for other staff members without committee approval. \nPhAM then asked Suda to produce documents related to her compensation, which served as the basis for the external law firm’s investigation, the institution said. \nPer Suda’s account, she had declined a scheduled pay increase in the first year of her five-year contract but received a standard 3% cost-of-living adjustment to her salary that had been approved by the museum’s new chief financial officer in 2024. She argued that the raise — “approximately $39,000 over two years” as her complaint states — was factored into the museum’s budget, cleared by the finance department, and transparently noted on the institution’s 990 form reviewed by the compensation committee. \n“The Museum’s accusations are false,” Nikas told Hyperallergic. “These are the same recycled allegations from the sham investigation that the Museum manufactured as a pretext for Suda’s wrongful termination.” \nThe museum board’s executive committee voted unanimously to terminate Suda on October 27 in light of the investigation’s findings, but gave her the option of voluntarily resigning from her roles “to limit any adverse publicity,” PhAM’s complaint stated. \nSeparately, the Philadelphia Inquirer revealed last week that over the summer, PhAM contacted the police regarding another former employee who has since been charged with theft. Latasha Harling, PhAM’s former chief people and diversity officer, reportedly racked up over $58,000 in personal expenses on her company credit card and failed to pay them back. \nAfter the expenses were flagged this January, Harling resigned without resolution when the museum proposed she repay a portion, the Inquirer reported. Since resigning, Harling reportedly signed a legally binding agreement to repay about a third of the original figure over three months, which she didn’t honor. Harling was arrested in July and charged with theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, and receiving stolen property.\nHarling’s legal counsel declined to comment on the matter, and PhAM did not immediately respond. \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

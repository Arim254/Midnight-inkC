    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Life, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen the his­to­ry books are writ­ten, we’ll remem­ber the politi­cians, law firms, and CEOs who quick­ly bent the knee to Don­ald Trump. We’ll also remem­ber the scant few Amer­i­can fig­ures who refused to back down. Bruce Spring­steen will be high on that short list.\nTour­ing in Europe last sum­mer, Spring­steen warned his audi­ence: “The Amer­i­ca that I love, the Amer­i­ca I have writ­ten about, that has been a bea­con of hope and lib­er­ty for 250 years, is cur­rent­ly in the hands of a cor­rupt, incom­pe­tent and trea­so­nous admin­is­tra­tion.” Those words seem par­tic­u­lar­ly pre­scient giv­en the chaos and vio­lence now unfold­ing in Min­neso­ta.\nFol­low­ing the shoot­ings of Renee Good and Alex Pret­ti, Spring­steen made his voice heard again—this time through music. Last week, he released the protest song “Streets of Min­neapo­lis” and soon after­ward trav­eled to Min­neso­ta to per­form the song live at a ben­e­fit con­cert arranged by Tom Morel­lo. Speak­ing to the crowd, Spring­steen said, “I wrote Streets of Min­neapo­lis and record­ed it the next day.” When he won­dered if the song sound­ed too ‘soap­boxy,’ he turned to Morel­lo, and the Rage Against the Machine gui­tarist replied, “Bruce, nuance is won­der­ful, but some­times you need to kick them in the teeth.” We’ll say amen to that.\nAfter “Streets of Min­neapo­lis,” Spring­steen and Morel­lo per­formed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” Watch it above. The start of the show began with “Killing In The Name Of.” Catch it below.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\nScott Gal­loway Unveils “Resist and Unsub­scribe,” an Action Plan for Con­sumers to Push Back Against Gov­ern­ment Over­reach\nTom Morel­lo Responds to Angry Fans Who Sud­den­ly Real­ize That Rage Against the Machine’s Music Is Polit­i­cal: “What Music of Mine DIDN’T Con­tain Polit­i­cal BS?”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Current Affairs, Economics |   \tFebruary 1st, 2026  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs men­tioned here last week, Scott Gal­loway argued that Amer­i­cans have one way to reverse the vio­lent over­reach of the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment: launch a one-month eco­nom­ic strike aimed at major tech and AI com­pa­nies, with the goal of reduc­ing Amer­i­ca’s GDP and mak­ing the mar­kets wob­ble. When the mar­kets gyrat­ed after “Lib­er­a­tion Day,” Pres­i­dent Trump imme­di­ate­ly rolled back many tar­iffs. Now, if Amer­i­cans can flex their eco­nom­ic mus­cles in Feb­ru­ary, Gal­loway wagers the admin­is­tra­tion will rethink whether it wants to keep arrest­ing jour­nal­ists and let­ting masked ICE agents shoot civil­ians in the streets—with impuni­ty.\nToday, Gal­loway has launched a new web­site, Resist and Unsub­scribe, that pro­vides an action plan for a month­long strike. In the “Ground Zero” sec­tion of the site, Gal­loway lists sub­scrip­tion ser­vices from America’s largest tech­nol­o­gy companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple, Net­flix, Ope­nAI, and Microsoft—and pro­vides links that let users unsub­scribe quick­ly. He also sug­gests hold­ing off on buy­ing new hard­ware and prod­ucts from these com­pa­nies (e.g. iPhones). If you use Feb­ru­ary to review your sub­scrip­tions and find ones to cut, you’ll clean up your per­son­al finances. You’ll also get the atten­tion of the major tech­nol­o­gy com­pa­nies that account for one-third of the S&P 500. When the tech CEOs get “yip­py,” so too will Trump.\nIn the “Blast Zone” sec­tion of Resist and Unsub­scribe, Gal­loway lists consumer‑facing com­pa­nies he has “iden­ti­fied as active enablers of ICE,” nam­ing AT&T, Com­cast, Lowe’s, Mar­riott, and Spo­ti­fy among oth­ers. He explains how these com­pa­nies sup­port ICE and rec­om­mends spe­cif­ic ser­vices you can can­cel or avoid. Scroll down the page to see these sug­ges­tions.\nVis­it Resist and Unsub­scribe, find some ser­vices to can­cel (it’s not a large sac­ri­fice), and spread the word. You can also find more infor­ma­tion about the Resist and Unsub­scribe move­ment on Gal­loway’s blog, “No Mercy/No Mal­ice.”\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nScott Gal­loway Explains How YOU Can Stop Gov­ern­ment Over­reach Using the Pow­er of Your Purse\nBruce Spring­steen Revives the Protest Song, Con­demns ICE Vio­lence in “Streets of Min­neapo­lis”\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, History, Music |   \tFebruary 2nd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThough his movies may have ben­e­fit­ed great­ly from for­eign audi­ences and back­ers, David Lynch was one of the most thor­ough­ly Amer­i­can of all film­mak­ers. “Born Mis­soula, MT,” declared his Twit­ter bio, yet one nev­er real­ly asso­ciates him with a par­tic­u­lar place in the Unit­ed States (at least no extant one). From Mon­tana, the Lynch fam­i­ly moved to Ida­ho, then Wash­ing­ton, then North Car­oli­na, then Vir­ginia. The tim­ing of that last stint proved cul­tur­al­ly for­tu­itous indeed: liv­ing in the city of Alexan­dria, the eigh­teen-year-old Lynch was close enough to the nation’s cap­i­tal to attend the very first con­cert the Bea­t­les played in North Amer­i­ca, at the Wash­ing­ton Col­i­se­um on Feb­ru­ary 11, 1964.\n“I was into rock and roll music, main­ly Elvis Pres­ley.” Lynch recalls this unsur­pris­ing fact in the clip above (which would have been among the last inter­views he gave before his death a year ago) from Bea­t­les ’64, the Mar­tin Scors­ese-pro­duced doc­u­men­tary on the Fab Four’s first U.S. tour.\n“I didn’t have any idea how big this event was. And it was in a gigan­tic place where they had box­ing match­es. The Bea­t­les were in the box­ing ring. It was so loud, you can’t believe. Girls shud­der­ing, cry­ing, scream­ing their heart out. It was phe­nom­e­nal.” That deaf­en­ing crowd noise fig­ures into most every account of the group’s Beat­le­ma­nia-era shows — and played a deci­sive role in their per­ma­nent retreat into the stu­dio a cou­ple of years lat­er.\nLynch sure­ly would have under­stood the desire for artis­tic explo­ration and con­trol that drove the Bea­t­les’ con­cen­tra­tion on mak­ing records. Even the sen­si­bil­i­ties of his work and theirs had some­thing in com­mon, exhibit­ing as they both did the unlike­ly com­bi­na­tion of pop­u­lar­i­ty and exper­i­men­ta­tion.  Some­how, David Lynch’s films and the Bea­t­les’ albums could ven­ture into bewil­der­ing obscu­ri­ty and sen­ti­men­tal kitsch with­out los­ing coher­ence or crit­i­cal respect. And dare one imag­ine that the expe­ri­ence of wit­ness­ing the Amer­i­can debut of what would become the most influ­en­tial rock band of all time has giv­en Lynch his appre­ci­a­tion — evi­dent in his movies, but also his own record­ings — for the pow­er of music, which he calls “one of the most fan­tas­tic things”? Even if not, it must have been, well… sur­re­al.\n\n\n\t\n\nvia Wel­come to Twin Peaks\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nAnge­lo Badala­men­ti Reveals How He and David Lynch Com­posed the Twin Peaks’ “Love Theme”\nWhen the Bea­t­les Refused to Play Before Seg­re­gat­ed Audi­ences on Their First U.S. Tour (1964)\nDavid Lynch Directs a New Music Video for Dono­van\nWatch the Bea­t­les Per­form Their Famous Rooftop Con­cert: It Hap­pened 50 Years Ago Today (Jan­u­ary 30, 1969)\nDavid Lynch Talks Med­i­ta­tion with Paul McCart­ney\nThe Wide-Rang­ing Cre­ative Genius of David Lynch (RIP): Dis­cov­er His Films, Music Videos, Car­toons, Com­mer­cials, Paint­ings, Pho­tog­ra­phy & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOn a promontory in eastern Portugal overlooking the Hispano-Portuguese plateau and the gorges of the Rio Erges, a spherical installation sits amid brush and old stone walls. A project of Paris-based studio Atelier Yokyok, “Ninho Globo” is made of a local black rock called schist. The material lends a dramatic effect in contrast to the sky and the windswept area of Salvaterra do Extremo, a town nestled in this rocky area bordering Spain.\nAtelier Yokyok is a four-person design studio founded by architects Samson Lacoste and Luc Pinsard and joined by Laure Qaremy and Pauline Lazareff. Evocative of Andy Goldworthy’s slate interventions in the form of portals and cones, “Ninho Globo” evokes a nest, a planet, or a giant seed pod tumbling through the landscape. Its title translates from Portuguese to mean “globe nest,” and its stark, otherworldly beauty challenges how we think about places of comfort and safety.\n\n“Ninho Globo” inhabits a former pig farm, where numerous walled pens known as furdas have been constructed from dry stone on a natural granite base. “It creates a small landscape strongly shaped by human intervention and endowed with heritage and archaeological significance,” says a statement. The installation invites visitors to step inside and pause, meditate on material and the surrounding environment, or simply get out of the wind.\nAtelier Yokyok chose a sphere to evoke celestial bodies and “an awareness of the planet as a shared place,” the team says. “It recalls its mineral origins…It embodies both stability and potential movement, gravity and balance. It conveys a sense of permanence, while engaging the body of those who experience it in a physical and spatial relationship.”\nThe pavilion is bisected by a deep, jagged space that the studio refers to as “The Canyon,” mirroring its rugged surroundings and creating a unique tension between its function as a shelter. Its goal is open-ended. “Is it a nest or a planet?…Can it be used? It challenges our relationship to the common good: how can it be used responsibly so that it endures? Who will come after us?”\nSee more on Atelier Yokyok’s Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDecades before the advent of photography, when European scientists and explorers were undertaking global expeditions and collecting flora and fauna from around the world, art and science converged in fields of medicine, anthropology, and natural history. During the Enlightenment, artists like Elizabeth Blackwell, John Gould, and Elizabeth Gould—among many, many others—documented botanicals, avians, insects, marine species, and more, many of which were published in hefty volumes and archived in museum collections.\nSarah Stone (1759-1844) was a British illustrator and the daughter of a fan painter, whose rich depictions of birds and artifacts highlight a singular talent during an era when women weren’t even permitted to be members of London’s prestigious Royal Academy. Nevertheless, she was invited to exhibit four drawings as an “Honorary Exhibitor” when she was 21.\nGoldfinch (Carduelis carduelis)\nIn the 1770s, British businessman and collector Sir Ashton Lever commissioned Stone to paint items in his museum chock-full of natural and ethnographic objects he called the Holophusikon, also known as the Lever Museum. Stone painted objects at Lever’s Holophusikon well into the 1780s, creating a visual chronicle of objects and fauna acquired from all over the world.\nAristocratic private museums were a phenomenon of the Enlightenment, when Britain enjoyed wealth, prestige, and influence, much of which was derived from other parts of the empire and the transatlantic slave trade. Many of today’s institutions, such as the British Museum, began with individuals’ private collections.\nNearly two dozen of the artist’s paintings are currently on view in Sarah Stone’s Unseen World: A Rare Collection of 18th Century Ornithological Watercolours as part of the Master Drawings New York art fair. Surveying a wide range of incredible birds, from the Bornean peacock pheasant to the distinctive orange-and-black rufous treepie.\nThe exhibition shares its title with a book co-authored by Errol Fuller and art dealer Craig Finch of Finch & Co., which presents the paintings this month. “Like many women painters of her time, Stone produced exquisite watercolour landscapes,” says a statement. “However, she was exceptional in her commercial success, with her paintings sought after by connoisseurs and collectors. In an era when women’s contributions were often overlooked, Stone defied the norm and stood out as a prominent figure.” \nSarah Stone’s Unseen World continues at Peter Harrington Rare Books in Manhattan through February 7.\nBarn Owl (Tyto alba)\nUnidentified Pheasant\nBornean Peacock Pheasant (Polyplecton schleirmacheri)\nDemoiselle Crane (Anthopoides virgo)\nRufous Treepie (Dendrocitta vagabunda)\nUnidentified Parakeets\nGuianan Cock of the Rock (Rupicola rupicola)\n\t\n\t\n\t",

We celebrate those who are willing to take a stand in this dangerous and oppressive landscape, when even speaking up can feel like a risk. But is participating in a one-day strike enough? And how is solidarity practiced on the day after?Two stories in today's newsletter prompt readers to ask difficult questions. The first is an in-depth report about tensions between art galleries and street vendors in a Manhattan art hub. The other is artist Damien Davis's opinion piece about the art world's performative allyship. These pieces invite us to think beyond good intentions and toward the more uncomfortable truth of what accountability and change truly demand.— Valentina Di Liscia, senior editor\nA group of prominent galleries is located on Broadway below Canal Street in Lower Manhattan, where street vendors were recently targeted by ICE raids. (photo Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic)Tribeca Galleries Discuss Reporting Street Vendors, Drawing CriticismA group of galleries in Tribeca met in January to discuss “issues of safety and accessibility” related to street vendor presence on and near Broadway, raising concerns among activists who say these sellers — many of them immigrants — are already under threat from local and federal officials. Staff Writer Isa Farfan spoke with street vendor advocates and local galleries for this deeply reported story, which illuminates the need for more education and information when it comes to the most vulnerable members of our community.After the Strike, Will Art Galleries Be Allies?Remember the black squares of 2020, shared on social media as a gesture of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement? Recent posts from arts organizations loudly announcing their participation in Friday's anti-ICE strike reminded Damien Davis of these and other often “frictionless” acts of allyship. In a much-needed opinion, he asks: “Will anything still be different after the news cycle passes and the next show opens?” \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Onassis AiR Opens Applications for 2026–27 Residencies in AthensParticipants receive an artist’s fee, a research budget, housing, round-trip travel, mentoring, and other resources to support their work.\n                        \n                        \n                            Learn more\n                        \n                    \n            From Our Critics Eugène Atget, \"École des Beaux-Arts, Monument Henri Regnault\" (1903) (photo courtesy the International Center of Photography)Eugène Atget, Readymade IconAn exhibition retells the story of his discovery by Berenice Abbott, leaving out the details of a life defined by failure. | Julia CurlJames Castle Was a World Unto HimselfThese works feel almost metaphysically transportive — like a universe bound by a different set of rules that’s a pleasure to explore. | Lisa Yin ZhangClaude Cahun’s Survival Guide for the AgesA new translation of the French artist’s 1930 memoir is a kaleidoscopic collection of dialogues, sketches, and Blakean proverbs. | Joyelle McSweeney\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            Explore Low and Full Residency MFA Options at Maine College of Art & DesignBuilt on a commitment to one-on-one mentoring, the MFA in Studio Art offers an interdisciplinary approach that inspires students to think across traditional academic boundaries.\n                        \n                        \n                            Learn more\n                        \n                    \n            Sandy Sanders on Valentina Di Liscia's “Another NFT Platform Bites the Dust”:Worthless is as worthless does.

With the PTB attempting to vault over the obstacle of physical reality with virtual reality \"products\", like crypto, NFTs, insane valuations, digital cash, digital everything, humanity is being delivered a reaffirmation of real, live, physical reality. It can't move in that direction fast enough for me. :-)Commenting privileges are reserved for paid members. Join us today!ICYMIIfrah Mansour, “Weaving Abundance” (2024) (photo courtesy Bakar Elmi)On Being a Somali Artist in MinnesotaViolence has a way of turning familiar places into guarded ground.

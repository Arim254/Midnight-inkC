    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe Renais­sance did not, strict­ly speak­ing, occur in Chi­na. Yet it seems that the Mid­dle King­dom did have its Renais­sance men, so to speak, and in much ear­li­er times at that. We find one such illus­tri­ous fig­ure in the Han dynasty of the first and sec­ond cen­turies: a states­man named Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), who man­aged to dis­tin­guish him­self across a range of fields from math­e­mat­ics to astron­o­my to phi­los­o­phy to poet­ry. His accom­plish­ments in sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy include invent­ing the first hydraulic armil­lary sphere for observ­ing the heav­ens, improv­ing water clocks with a sec­ondary tank, cal­cu­lat­ing pi fur­ther than it had been in Chi­na to date, and mak­ing dis­cov­er­ies about the nature of the moon. He also, so records show, put togeth­er the first-ever seis­mo­scope, a device for detect­ing earth­quakes.\nA visu­al expla­na­tion of Zhang’s design appears in the Sci­ence­World video above. His seis­mo­scope, its nar­ra­tor says, “was called hòufēng dìdòngyí, which means ‘instru­ment for mea­sur­ing sea­son­al winds and move­ments of the earth,’ ” and it could “deter­mine rough­ly the direc­tion in which an earth­quake occurred.”\nEach of its eight drag­on heads (a com­bi­na­tion of num­ber and crea­ture that, in Chi­na, could hard­ly be more aus­pi­cious) holds a ball; when the ground shook, the drag­on point­ing toward the epi­cen­ter of the quake drops its ball into the mouth of one of the dec­o­ra­tive toads wait­ing below. At one time, as his­to­ry has record­ed, it “detect­ed an earth­quake 650 kilo­me­ters, or 400 miles away, that was­n’t felt at the loca­tion of the seis­mo­scope.”\nNot bad, con­sid­er­ing that nei­ther Zhang nor any­one else had yet heard of tec­ton­ic plates. But as all engi­neers know, prac­ti­cal devices often work just fine even in the absence of com­plete­ly sound the­o­ry. Though no con­tem­po­rary exam­ples of hòufēng dìdòngyí sur­vive from Zhang’s time, “researchers believe that inside the seis­mo­scope were a pen­du­lum, a bronze ball under the pen­du­lum, eight chan­nels, and eight levers that acti­vat­ed the drag­ons’ mouths.” Mov­ing in response to a shock wave, the pen­du­lum would release the ball in the oppo­site direc­tion, which would roll down a chan­nel and release the mouth at the end of it. How­ev­er inno­v­a­tive it was for its time, this scheme could, of course, pro­vide no infor­ma­tion about exact­ly how far away the earth­quake hap­pened, to say noth­ing of pre­dic­tion. For­tu­nate­ly, cen­turies of Renais­sance men still lay ahead to fig­ure all that out.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Greeks Invent­ed the First Com­put­er: An Intro­duc­tion to the Antikythera Mech­a­nism (Cir­ca 87 BC)\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nBehold Col­or Pho­tographs Tak­en Dur­ing the After­math of San Francisco’s Dev­as­tat­ing 1906 Earth­quake\nChina’s 8,000 Ter­ra­cot­ta War­riors: An Ani­mat­ed & Inter­ac­tive Intro­duc­tion to a Great Archae­o­log­i­cal Dis­cov­ery\nWhat Ancient Chi­nese Phi­los­o­phy Can Teach Us About Liv­ing the Good Life Today: Lessons from Harvard’s Pop­u­lar Pro­fes­sor, Michael Puett\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

Traveling to the Okinawa prefecture in the hopes of encountering a scarcely documented species of larval goosefish, Kovacs spent nearly two weeks blackwater diving before photographing the rare moment. \n“Unfortunately, this beautiful little fish turned out to be incredibly uncooperative and difficult to photograph,” Kovacs says. “After spending some time with it, I was very fortunate that, for one brief moment, it decided to yawn while facing the camera.” The resulting image is aptly titled “Tired fish.”\nSteven Kovacs, “Tired Fish,” Kumejima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan\nThis past year, the annual contest saw thousands of entries spanning more than 90 countries. From silky sharks in Cuba to small pipefish in Indonesia, each photograph highlights unique, fleeting underwater moments that often go unseen. Awardees took home more than $60,000 in prizes, including once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as diving excursions, cruises, and liveaboard trips.\nTake a plunge into the online gallery of winning images, highlighting 14 distinctive categories.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn his forthcoming solo exhibition, Building Identities Through Style, Glenn Hardy Jr. excavates the strata of fashion, especially how identities are shaped and perceived through appearance. \nBased in Washington, D.C., Hardy is a self-taught painter whose bold portraits emphasize Black life “liberated from the burdens of racial stereotypes and conflict,” says Charlie James Gallery, which is currently presenting the show. The figures in Hardy’s compositions often engage in everyday leisure activities or settle into places of refuge and camaraderie, like studios, athletic courts, and domestic spaces.\n“Mannequin | Cherry Blossoms” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 40 x 30 inches\nBuilding Identities Through Style emphasizes fashion as more than simply personal expression or “self-celebration,” as described in a statement. Hardy examines the complexities of garments, trends, and luxury through the lens of desire and access, juxtaposing elements of reality and fantasy—especially in a series of paintings of mannequins topped with realistic visages, like individual characters being pieced together as their tailored apparel takes shape.\nThe artist is interested in how sartorial choices nod to complex systems of negotiation and judgment that inform our understanding of conformity, difference, and a sense of belonging. “Hardy not only interrogates the manner in which Black bodies are seen and assessed, but also the ways in which stylistic excellence has become both reputational armor and a source of joy, experimentation, and play,” the gallery says.\n“Soar Thumb,” for example, portrays a group of men in an elevator, all but one of whom are dressed in nearly identical suits and sport short haircuts. The outlier is a tall individual with bold dreadlocks and a white tank top, standing confidently with his arms crossed and gazing directly at the viewer. \n“Soar Thumb” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 36 x 36 inches\nHardy frames the contrast not as an act of rebellion but as a means of parsing how, within a shared space, some find conformity to bring a sense of safety or comfort, while others view individual expression to be—in addition to its liberating nature—a kind of buffer or armor.\n“The suited figures are not antagonists but participants in the same system of social evaluation, using uniformity as protection,” says a statement. “The outlier is neither hero nor foil; he is exposed. The work asks not which presentation is more authentic, but what each form of visibility costs.”\nBuilding Identities Through Style continues through February 7 in Los Angeles.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nJoy Machine is thrilled to present World in My Eyes, a duo exhibition of Chicago artists Kayla Mahaffey and Joseph Perez, a.k.a. Sentrock.\nWorld in My Eyes is, first and foremost, rooted in the lives of everyday people. Both Sentrock and Mahaffey have long depicted friends and neighbors in their own Chicago neighborhoods, exploring how our city shapes its youngest residents. How are children cared for? How are their imaginations and dreams nurtured? These questions recur throughout both artists’ practices and always hinge on another: how do children thrive amid turmoil, whether political, cultural, or personal?\nSentrock, “Better days ahead” (2026), spray paint and latex paint on canvas, 36 x 48 inches\nIn World in My Eyes, Sentrock’s signature bird character meets Mahaffey’s energetic cast. Each artist confronts an underlying struggle—whether an unrealized dream or a physical need—not through an unrealistic swaddle of optimism but rather through the often-repeated idea that hope is a practice. For children, and for all of us seeking a better tomorrow, hope starts with courage.\nAn opening reception will be held from 6 to 9 p.m. on January 30. RSVP.

After years of restoration and preparation, visitors to the Worcester Art Museum can now explore the armor galleries, reopened in November of last year. Although there is a fair bit of lore concerned with chivalry and round tables, this armor exhibition goes far beyond the problematic romantic notion of the white knights of medieval Europe. By collectively presenting armor donned by everyone from hoplites to samurai to Sudanese soldiers, the galleries make an important argument for the global appreciation of these wearable pieces of art. Why do certain museums in North America have so much armor in their collections? Armor collecting was quite the hobby of Gilded Age collectors and businessmen like William Randolph Hearst and Clarence H. Mackay. These wealthy men and their foundations donated much of their extensive collections to places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City or the Detroit Institute of Arts. The former, for instance, currently holds the largest collection of arms and armor in the nation, with a staggering 14,000 objects. But what is less well known is that the second-largest armor collection in the United States resides not at the Getty or the Art Institute of Chicago, but within the Worcester Art Museum (WAM) in Massachusetts. A display case focuses on the animal armor worn by horses from across the globe. There are 16th-century shaffrons from Southern Germany and the Ottoman Empire, as well as Chinese stirrups from the 17th-18th centuries. The case also features various spurs and an equestrian figurine from 1900s Ivory Coast.Armor suit influenced by the Mughal invasion of India during the 1500sThe heart of the WAM’s armor collection originally came from the wealthy collector John Woodman Higgins (1874–1961). The son of a major industrialist, he became a steel magnate in Worcester, then known as the “crossroads of New England” due to its status as a key manufacturing hub with access to multiple railroads and a shipping canal. He was fascinated by medieval chivalry and knights. Higgins’s collection focused most heavily on European armor, but included a number of examples outside of medieval Europe as well. In 1931, he opened the Higgins Armory Museum to the public in order to display his collections. That institution closed in 2013, but WAM acquired the archive in 2014. After 12 years, the Higgins armor is back on display, alongside other pieces the institution collected in the intervening years. One of the arms and armor display cases now open in the armory galleries of the Worcester Art MuseumUnknown Artisan, “Corinthian Helmet” (600–550 BCE), bronzeAnd this time, the world of armored knights has gone global. Although medieval European armor appears in the galleries, it is presented with equal billing alongside fascinating works from India, Japan, Egypt, Sudan, Ancient Rome, Classical Greece, and many other places across the globe. Indeed, whatever our modern-day associations may be, one of the earliest known depictions of armor is on the Sumerian Standard of Ur (modern Iraq), which dates to around 2550 BCE and is now held by the British Museum. The WAM presentation carries the history of armor and arms into the present. Visitors can even try on a Mandalorian helmet if they want to engage with the fictional future of the art. Wall diagrams allow visitors to name the various parts of historical suits of armor, such as the samurai armor on display in a glass case. Unknown artisan, “Helmet in the form of a Sea Conch Shell\" (1618), iron with traces of lacquer, textilesHelpful interactive digital displays allow viewers to explore the labels and items within large glass display cases. They can even peruse the open storage collections that are off view due to space restrictions. Wall diagrams helpfully label suits of armor like the Dō-maru gusoku (samurai armor) and traditional European armor from the Middle Ages. While the gallery walls are packed to the hilt with items and weapons, this lends a sense of cohesion and continuity throughout.   The displays and gallery labels point to the fact that armor was not just for use in battle. Beyond warfare, there was a pageantry surrounding the display of this metal fashion, which was often worn within tournaments and during parades as well. I was impressed by the horse armor and spurs on display for viewers, and even more delighted by the “dog armor” based on a 16th-century medieval European armor suit for a Spanish hunting dog. The Met’s former official armorer (that is a real job!), Leonard Heinrich, designed it for the Higgins Museum in 1943. Leonard Heinrich, “Helmutt” (1942), based on 16th-century armor for a Spanish hunting dogDr. Tom Keegan dons a copy of a Mandalorian helmet that visitors can try onIt is refreshing to see medieval Europe decentered but still in conversation with both ancient and medieval armor from across the world. As it turns out, the setting of knights’ tales doesn’t just take place in the storied landscapes of the European Middle Ages. They stretch across Eurasia, Africa, Japan, and beyond. The WAM’s galleries don’t remark on this decentering. The galleries instead demonstrate visually that these tales can and should be revised and retold through the diverse arms and armor donned by warriors, resistors, and aristocrats from across the earth — and even those fighting in a galaxy far, far away. \n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Worcester Art Museum\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

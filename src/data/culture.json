Final­ly, a chance to catch up on all the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/07/how-to-read-many-more-books-in-a-year.html\">read­ing</a> we’ve been mean­ing to do. Final­ly, an envi­ron­ment con­ducive to this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/09/meditation-for-beginners.html\">med­i­ta­tion</a> thing about whose ben­e­fits we’ve heard so much. (Per­haps we made those very assur­ances to our­selves when the COVID-19 pan­dem­ic set in.) But accord­ing to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USW8yf4L-R4\">the ani­mat­ed TED-Ed les­son above</a>, writ­ten by psy­chi­a­trist and cor­rec­tion­al men­tal health expert Ter­ry Kupers, the neg­a­tives of the expe­ri­ence would well out­weigh the pos­i­tives. It all comes by way of answer­ing the ques­tion, “What hap­pens to your brain with­out any social con­tact?”</p>\n<p>Unsur­pris­ing­ly, per­haps, iso­la­tion takes its great­est toll when imposed against the will of the iso­lat­ed, and even more so when imposed for an indef­i­nite dura­tion. “Ear­ly on, stress hor­mones may spike, and as time pass­es, that stress can become chron­ic,” says the video’s nar­ra­tor.</p>\n<p>With­out the avail­abil­i­ty of social inter­ac­tions as “a sound­ing board where we can gauge how ratio­nal our per­cep­tions are,” one’s “sense of iden­ti­ty and real­i­ty becomes threat­ened.” The stage is there­fore set for “depres­sion, obses­sions, sui­ci­dal ideation, and, for some, delu­sions and hal­lu­ci­na­tions.” Sleep­ing dif­fi­cul­ties can man­i­fest on the more strict­ly phys­i­cal end, poten­tial­ly accom­pa­nied by “heart pal­pi­ta­tions, headaches, dizzi­ness, and hyper­sen­si­tiv­i­ty.”</p>\n<p>While trav­el­ing in the Unit­ed States, Charles Dick­ens bore wit­ness to the pun­ish­ment by soli­tary con­fine­ment already in effect in Amer­i­can pris­ons, com­ing away with the impres­sion that it was “worse than any tor­ture of the body.” He wrote that after a vis­it to a Philadel­phia pen­i­ten­tiary, whose very name reflects the the­o­ry, held by the Quak­er groups who intro­duced the prac­tice in the late eigh­teenth cen­tu­ry, that it could “bring about reflec­tion and pen­i­tence.” After much research on the mat­ter, Kupers has come to the con­clu­sion that, in fact, it “does immense dam­age that is con­trary to reha­bil­i­ta­tion, while fail­ing to reduce prison vio­lence.” If you’re read­ing this, you may not be espe­cial­ly like­ly to be sen­tenced to invol­un­tary con­fine­ment. But the next time you start feel­ing out of sorts for rea­sons you can’t pin down, con­sid­er how long it’s been since you’ve spent real time with real peo­ple.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2020/11/what-happens-when-you-spend-weeks-months-or-years-in-solitary-confinement.html\">What Hap­pens When You Spend Weeks, Months, or Years in Soli­tary Con­fine­ment</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2024/01/how-loneliness-is-killing-us-a-primer-from-harvard-psychiatrist-zen-priest-robert-waldinger.html\">How Lone­li­ness Is Killing Us: A Primer from Har­vard Psy­chi­a­trist & Zen Priest Robert Waldinger</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2014/10/when-modern-art-was-used-as-torture-during-the-spanish-civil-war.html\">Mod­ern Art Was Used As a Tor­ture Tech­nique in Prison Cells Dur­ing the Span­ish Civ­il War</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/09/what-an-85-year-long-harvard-study-says-is-the-real-key-to-happiness.html\">What an 85-Year-Long Har­vard Study Says Is the Real Key to Hap­pi­ness</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/08/on-the-power-of-teaching-philosophy-in-prisons.html\">On the Pow­er of Teach­ing Phi­los­o­phy in Pris­ons</a></p>\n<p><em>Based in Seoul, </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">Col­in</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\"> M</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">a</a></em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.colinmarshall.org/\">rshall</a> writes and broad­cas</em><em>ts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

But the life to which Borges attach­es his labyrinths is a librar­i­an’s life; the strands that anchor his fic­tions are the obscure schol­ar­ly ref­er­ences he weaves through­out his text. Borges brings this ten­den­cy to whim­si­cal employ in his non­fic­tion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3auGKng\"><em>Book of Imag­i­nary Beings</em>,</a> a het­ero­ge­neous com­pendi­um of crea­tures from ancient folk­tale, myth, and demonolo­gy around the world.</p>\n<p>Borges him­self some­times remarks on how these ancient sto­ries can float too far away from rati­o­ci­na­tion. The “absurd hypothe­ses” regard­ing the myth­i­cal Greek Chimera, for exam­ple, “are proof” that the ridicu­lous beast “was begin­ning to bore peo­ple…. A vain or fool­ish fan­cy is the def­i­n­i­tion of Chimera that we now find in dic­tio­nar­ies.” Of  what he calls “Jew­ish Demons,” a cat­e­go­ry too numer­ous to parse, he writes, “a cen­sus of its pop­u­la­tion left the bounds of arith­metic far behind.</p>\n<p>Through­out the cen­turies, Egypt, Baby­lo­nia, and Per­sia all enriched this teem­ing mid­dle world.” Although a less­er field than angelol­o­gy, the influ­ence of this fas­ci­nat­ing­ly diverse canon only broad­ened over time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224803/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-20-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“The natives record­ed in the Tal­mud” soon became “thor­ough­ly inte­grat­ed” with the many demons of Chris­t­ian Europe and the Islam­ic world, form­ing a sprawl­ing hell whose denizens hail from at least three con­ti­nents, and who have mixed freely in alchem­i­cal, astro­log­i­cal, and oth­er occult works since at least the 13th cen­tu­ry and into the present. One exam­ple from the ear­ly 20th cen­tu­ry, a 1902 trea­tise on div­ina­tion from Isfa­han, a city in cen­tral Iran, draws on this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/demons-and-demonology\">ancient thread</a> with a series of water­col­ors added in 1921 that could eas­i­ly be mis­tak­en for illus­tra­tions from the ear­ly Mid­dle Ages.</p>\n<p>As <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/persian-demons-from-a-book-of-magic-and-astrology-1921\">the Pub­lic Domain Review notes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The won­der­ful images draw on Near East­ern demono­log­i­cal tra­di­tions that stretch back mil­len­nia — to the days when the rab­bis of the Baby­lon­ian Tal­mud <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/109188/the-talmuds-many-demons\">assert­ed</a> it was a bless­ing demons were invis­i­ble, since, “if the eye would be grant­ed per­mis­sion to see, no crea­ture would be able to stand in the face of the demons that sur­round it.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The author of the trea­tise, a <em>ram­mal</em>, or sooth­say­er, him­self “attrib­ut­es his knowl­edge to the Bib­li­cal Solomon, who was known for his pow­er over demons and spir­its,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ajammc.com/2017/10/31/demons-licking-toes/\">writes Ali Kar­joo-Ravary</a>, now an assis­tant pro­fes­sor of Islam­ic his­to­ry at Colum­bia Uni­ver­si­ty. Pre­dat­ing Islam, “the depic­tion of demons in the Near East… was fre­quent­ly used for mag­i­cal and tal­is­man­ic pur­pos­es,” just as it was by occultists like Aleis­ter Crow­ley at the time these illus­tra­tions were made.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224825/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-10-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>“Not all of the 56 paint­ed illus­tra­tions in the man­u­script depict demon­ic beings,” the Pub­lic Domain Review points out. “Amongst the horned and fork-tongued we also find the archangels Jibrāʾīl (Gabriel) and Mikāʾīl (Michael), as well as the ani­mals — lion, lamb, crab, fish, scor­pi­on — asso­ci­at­ed with the zodi­ac.” But in the main, it’s demon city. What would Borges have made of these fan­tas­tic images? No doubt, had he seen them, and he had seen plen­ty of their like before he lost his sight, he would have been delight­ed.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>A blue man with claws, four horns, and a pro­ject­ing red tongue is no less fright­en­ing for the fact that he’s wear­ing a can­dy-striped loin­cloth. In anoth­er image we see a mous­ta­chioed goat man with tuber-nose and pol­ka dot skin mani­a­cal­ly con­coct­ing a less-than-appetis­ing dish. One recur­ring (and wor­ry­ing) theme is demons vis­it­ing sleep­ers in their beds, scenes involv­ing such pleas­ant activ­i­ties as tooth-pulling, eye-goug­ing, and — in one of the most engross­ing illus­tra­tions — a bout of foot-lick­ing (per­formed by a rep­til­ian feline with a shark-toothed tail).</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s a play­ful Boschi­an qual­i­ty to all of this, but while we tend to see Bosch’s work from our per­spec­tive as absurd, he appar­ent­ly took his bizarre inven­tions absolute­ly seri­ous­ly. So too, we might assume, did the illus­tra­tor here. We might won­der, as Woolf did, about this work as the prod­uct of “suf­fer­ing human beings… attached to gross­ly mate­r­i­al things, like health and mon­ey and the hous­es we live in.” What kinds of ordi­nary, mate­r­i­al con­cerns might have afflict­ed this artist, as he (we pre­sume) imag­ined demons goug­ing the eyes and lick­ing the feet of peo­ple tucked safe­ly in their beds?</p>\n<p>See many more of these strange paint­ings at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/persian-demons-from-a-book-of-magic-and-astrology-1921\">the Pub­lic Domain Review</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-293x360.jpg 293w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-195x240.jpg 195w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224926/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-2-300x369.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-293x360.jpg 293w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-195x240.jpg 195w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224932/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-4-300x369.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26224939/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-6-300x379.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225008/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-18-300x379.jpg 300w\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24.jpg 680w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-285x360.jpg 285w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-190x240.jpg 190w, https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/03/26225015/1902-Isfahan-Demon-Pictures-24-300x379.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Relat­ed Con­tent:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/04/persian-manuscripts-spanning-700-years-now-digitized-and-available-online.html\">700 Years of Per­sian Man­u­scripts Now Dig­i­tized and Avail­able Online</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Permanent Link to 2,178 Occult Books Now Digitized & Put Online, Thanks to the Ritman Library and <i>Da Vinci Code</i> Author Dan Brown\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2025/08/2178-occult-books-now-digitized-put-online.html\">2,178 Occult Books Now Dig­i­tized & Put Online, Thanks to the Rit­man Library and <i>Da Vin­ci Code</i> Author Dan Brown</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2019/12/160000-pages-of-glorious-medieval-manuscripts-digitized.html\">160,000 Pages of Glo­ri­ous Medieval Man­u­scripts Dig­i­tized: Vis­it the Bib­lio­the­ca Philadel­phien­sis</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"><em>Josh Jones</em></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. </em></p>\n<br />\t\t</div>",

Lat­er still, in 1972, that piece of music was adopt­ed by the Coun­cil of Europe as the con­ti­nen­t’s anthem; in 1985, the Euro­pean Union made it offi­cial as well.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"505\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/p5favl2Qtx0?wmode=transparent&fs=1&hl=en&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<p>In a sense, “Ode to Joy” is a nat­ur­al choice for a musi­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Europe, not just for its explic­it themes, but also for the obvi­ous ambi­tion of the sym­pho­ny that includes it to cap­ture an entire civ­i­liza­tion in musi­cal form.</p>\n<p>Its com­plex­i­ty and con­tra­dic­tion may be eas­i­er to appre­ci­ate through these videos, which con­sti­tute <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL865A414178BA4B6F\">a visu­al­iza­tion by Stephen Mali­nows­ki</a>, cre­ator of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2017/11/watch-classical-music-come-to-life-in-artfully-animated-scores.html\">Music Ani­ma­tion Machine</a>, pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture for his ani­mat­ed scores of every­thing from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/?p=1122099\">Vivaldi’s <em>Four Sea­sons</em></a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/05/bachs_brandenburg_concerto_4_visualized_by_the_great_music_animation_machine.html\">Bach’s Bran­den­burg Con­cer­to no. 4</a> to Debussy’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2013/10/debussys-clair-de-lune.html\"><em>Clair de lune</em></a>.

Traveling to derelict sites to immortalize forgotten corners of the world, the French photographer invites viewers into spaces where humans are decentered.</p>\n<p>The boundaries between interior and exterior are a key element in Veillon’s approach to abandoned growing houses, where he emphasizes their convergence. “It is ironic to see that, on the contrary, nature felt imprisoned there and sought to break free from its captor, unleashing its unstoppable force,” the photographer shares in a series statement. “Now, we admire vegetation that has become one with the bars of its cage.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-960x641.jpg\" alt=\"a photograph by Romain Veillon of the interior of an abandoned greenhouse overtaken by dense, rollicking vegetation\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-960x641.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Secret-Garden-14.jpg 1500w\" /></figure>\n<p>Veillon’s photographs are formidable, documenting the power nature holds to eventually reclaim spaces no longer governed by human intervention. While echoes of the presence of man persist in each image—through shattered stained glass window panes, rusting pipes, and piles of unused pots—the commanding force of rollicking vegetation is a clear reminder that  in the end, nature endures beyond us.</p>\n<p>Find more on Veillon’s <a href=\"https://romainveillon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, and keep up with his practice on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/romain_veillon/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.

Some were also penned by German civilians in the post-war era. “The accumulated pages reveal an expansive record of shared human existence across national boundaries,” the gallery says.</p>\n<p>“When the body is gone, the objects which surrounded them remain behind,” Shiota says in a statement. “As I wander the stalls of the markets in Berlin, I find especially personal items like photographs, old passports, and personal diaries. Once, I found a diary from 1946, which was an intimate insight into the person’s life and experiences.” For Shiota, the power of these objects are revealed in how she feels the presence of writer’s “inner self.”</p>\n<p><em>Two Home Countries </em>is on view through January 11 in New York City.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p>In the hands of Argentinian tattooer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pontotattoo/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Ponto</a>, lush gradients and surreal compositions emerge from layers and layers of tiny dots. Entirely self-taught, Ponto never learned to use the machines typical for many artists working in the medium. He instead embarked on an experimental journey 13 years ago that has since produced a vibrant catalog of designs, from a grayscale eye crying primary colors or a vivid beam shooting from a flying saucer.</p>\n<p>Ponto shares that while his process is typically slower than that of artists who utilize machines, his tools and approach are simple. “I just have to layer dots until I reach my desired saturation and look, which varies from skin to skin and the tattoo’s characteristics,” he says. “I use several kinds of needles to play with dot width, resolution, tattooing depth, ink saturation, and a few more variables to create my designs.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5.jpg\" alt=\"a white arm with a tattoo by Nano Ponto of a vibrant gradient beaming from a flying saucer\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5.jpg 1200w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-640x533.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-960x800.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ponto-5-768x640.jpg 768w\" /></figure>\n<p>While based in Buenos Aires, Ponto has spent the past few years moving between Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. Travel has been essential to his development from the beginning because most artists work with newer technologies and don’t share the same technical approaches. “Ten years ago, it was key for me to start traveling to meet other handpoked tattoo artists to share experience and knowledge, as there was no one in Argentina I could do this with,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Ponto’s latest travels have brought him to Brooklyn, where he’s a guest resident this month at <a href=\"https://www.ateliereva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Atelier Eva</a>.

    "body": "<section>\n<article>\n\t<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://calder.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Calder</a>’s most widely recognized creation is perhaps the mobile. The lauded artist was a titan of Modernism whose desire to “draw” three-dimensional objects spirited the invention of what went on to become both an art historical achievement and a ubiquitous nursery item. Broadly interested in movement and space, Calder (1898–1976) is often cited as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>Now, his work finds a new home in a sprawling museum in Philadelphia, the city where his family lived for generations and where he was born. Located on Benjamin Franklin Parkway, <a href=\"https://caldergardens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Calder Gardens</a> comprises a 1.8-acre landscape and an 18,000-square-foot building that presents a rotating selection of the artist’s works. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/calder-8.jpg\" alt=\"the open atrium at Calder Gardens with two large-scale sculptures in red and black and a large hanging mobile\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/calder-8.jpg 2000w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/calder-8-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/calder-8-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/calder-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/calder-8-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n<p>The museum is designed to bring art, architecture, and nature into a constant and ever-evolving conversation. Outdoor sculptures stand amid a lush prairie by <a href=\"https://oudolf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Piet Oudolf</a>, while architecture firm <a href=\"https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Herzog & de Meuron</a> created an interior that interacts with Calder’s sculptures.

    "body": "\n\tin Education, Games |   \tJanuary 8th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs any new par­ent soon finds out, there exists a robust mar­ket for prod­ucts, ser­vices, and media that promise to boost a child’s intel­li­gence. Some of these offer­ings come as close as legal­ly pos­si­ble to hold­ing out the promise of putting any tot on the path to genius, brazen­ly beg­ging the ques­tion of whether it’s pos­si­ble to raise a genius in the first place. Still, the efforts par­ents have delib­er­ate­ly made in that direc­tion have occa­sion­al­ly pro­duced notable results, from epochal fig­ures like Mozart or John Stu­art Mill to the promis­ing-math­e­mati­cian-turned-street­car-trans­fer-obsessed-recluse William Sidis. More recent­ly came the Pol­gár sis­ters, who were suc­cess­ful­ly raised to become some of the great­est female chess play­ers in his­to­ry.\nHav­ing stud­ied the nature of intel­li­gence at uni­ver­si­ty, their father Lás­zló got it in his head that, since most genius­es start­ed learn­ing their sub­jects inten­sive­ly and ear­ly, par­ents could cul­ti­vate genius-lev­el per­for­mance in their chil­dren by direct­ing that learn­ing process them­selves. He sought out a wife both intel­lec­tu­al­ly promis­ing and will­ing to devote her­self to test­ing this hypoth­e­sis. Togeth­er they went on to father three daugh­ters, putting them through a rig­or­ous, cus­tom-made edu­ca­tion ori­ent­ed toward chess mas­tery. Chess became the pro­jec­t’s cen­tral sub­ject in large part because of its sheer objec­tiv­i­ty, all the bet­ter for Lás­zló Pol­gár to mea­sure the results of this domes­tic exper­i­ment.\nNor could it have hurt, giv­en the impor­tance of retain­ing the inter­est of chil­dren, that chess was a game — and one with evoca­tive toy-like pieces — that offers imme­di­ate feed­back and feel­ings of accom­plish­ment. For his daugh­ters, Pol­gár has empha­sized, learn­ing involved none of the drudgery and busy­work of school. “A child does not like only play: for them it is also enjoy­able to acquire infor­ma­tion and solve prob­lems,” he writes in his book Raise a Genius! “A child’s work can also be enjoy­able; so can learn­ing, if it is suf­fi­cient­ly moti­vat­ing, and if it means a con­stant sup­ply of prob­lems to solve that are appro­pri­ate for the lev­el of the child’s needs. A child does not need play sep­a­rate from work, but mean­ing­ful action.”\nThe proof of Pol­gár’s the­o­ries is in the pud­ding — or at any rate, in the rat­ings. All three of his daugh­ters became elite chess play­ers. Sofia, the mid­dle one, became the sixth-strongest female play­er in the world; Susan, the eldest, the top-ranked female play­er in the world; Judit, the youngest, the strongest female chess play­er of all time. This despite the fact that their father was an unex­cep­tion­al chess play­er, and their moth­er not a chess play­er at all. Some eager­ly take the sto­ry of the Pol­gár sis­ters as a vin­di­ca­tion of nur­ture over nature; oth­ers, sci­en­tif­ic researchers includ­ed, argue that it only shows that prac­tice is a nec­es­sary con­di­tion for this kind of genius, not a suf­fi­cient one. For my part, hav­ing kept an eye on a pair of infant twins while writ­ing this, I’d be hap­py if my own kids could just mas­ter hold­ing on to their bot­tles.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nLearn How to Play Chess Online: Free Chess Lessons for Begin­ners, Inter­me­di­ate Play­ers & Beyond\nMeet Alma Deutsch­er, the Clas­si­cal Music Prodi­gy: Watch Her Per­for­mances from Age 6 to 14\nThe Mag­ic of Chess: Kids Share Their Unin­hib­it­ed, Philo­soph­i­cal Insights about the Ben­e­fits of Chess\nHear the Pieces Mozart Com­posed When He Was Only 5 Years Old\nRead an 18th-Cen­tu­ry Eye­wit­ness Account of 8‑Year-Old Mozart’s Extra­or­di­nary Musi­cal Skills\nThe Renewed Pop­u­lar­i­ty of Chess and The Queen’s Gam­bit: Pret­ty Much Pop Cul­ture Pod­cast Dis­cus­sion #78 with Chess Expert J.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nAs much as it is about every part of Dublin that ever passed by James Joyce’s once-young eyes, Ulysses is also a book about books, and about writ­ing and speech—as myth­ic invo­ca­tion, as seduc­tion, chat­ter, and rhetoric, ful­some and emp­ty. Words—two-faced, like open books—carry with them at least two sens­es, the mean­ing of their present utter­ance, and the ver­so shades of his­to­ry. This is at least part­ly the import of Joyce’s myth­i­cal method, as it is that of all expos­i­tors of ancient texts, from preach­ers and the­olo­gians to lit­er­ary crit­ics. It seems par­tic­u­lar­ly sig­nif­i­cant, then, that the pas­sage Joyce chose for the one and only record­ing of a read­ing from Ulysses comes from the “Aeo­lus” episode, which par­o­dies Odysseus and his com­pan­ions’ encounter with the god of wind.\nJoyce sets the scene in the news­pa­per offices of the Freeman’s Jour­nal, epit­o­me of writ­ing in the present tense, where reporters and edi­tors give puffed-up speech­es punc­tu­at­ed by reduc­tive, pithy head­lines. Amidst this busi­ness, eru­dite pro­fes­sor MacHugh and Stephen Dedalus wax lit­er­ary and his­tor­i­cal, mak­ing con­nec­tions. MacHugh recites “the finest dis­play of ora­to­ry” he ever heard—a defense of the revival of the Irish lan­guage that com­pares the Irish peo­ple to Moses and the ancient Hebrews spurn­ing the seduc­tions of an oppres­sive empire in the per­son of an Egypt­ian high priest: Vagrants and day­labour­ers are you called: the world trem­bles at our name.\nJoyce record­ed the pas­sage in 1924 at the urg­ing of Shake­speare and Com­pa­ny founder Sylvia Beach, who per­suad­ed the HMV gramo­phone stu­dio in Paris to make the record, under the pro­vi­sion that she would finance it and that the studio’s name would appear nowhere on the prod­uct. Ulysses, recall, was in many places under a ban for obscen­i­ty (not lift­ed in the U.S. until 1933 by Judge John Woolsey). The record­ing ses­sion was painful for Joyce, who need­ed two attempts on two sep­a­rate days to com­plete it, plagued as he was by his fail­ing eyes. And yet Joyce, Beach wrote in her notes, “was anx­ious to have the record­ing made… He had made up his mind, he told me, that this would be his only read­ing from Ulysses… it is more, one feels, than mere ora­to­ry.” You can read the speech here while lis­ten­ing to Joyce read above. Beach called Joyce’s read­ing a “won­der­ful per­for­mance.” “I nev­er hear it,” she wrote, “with­out being deeply moved.”\n\n\n\t\n\nWhile Beach may have been sat­is­fied with the record­ing, her friend, lin­guist C.K. Ogden pro­nounced it “very bad,” mean­ing, writes Beach, “it was not a suc­cess tech­ni­cal­ly” (though it was not, in any case, “at all a com­mer­cial ven­ture”). You will notice this imme­di­ate­ly as you strug­gle to hear Joyce’s mut­ed read­ing. Anx­ious to pre­serve his voice in a clear­er doc­u­ment, Ogden cap­tured Joyce read­ing from Finnegans Wake five years lat­er at the stu­dio of the Ornitho­log­i­cal Soci­ety in Cam­bridge (he boast­ed of own­ing “the two biggest record­ing machines in the world”). By this time, Joyce’s eye­sight had almost com­plete­ly dimmed. Ogden pho­tographed the text and enlarged it so that the let­ters were a half-inch tall, yet Joyce still could bare­ly make them out and “sup­pos­ed­ly need­ed some­one to whis­per along” (Beach, who was not present, imag­ined he must have known the pas­sage by heart).\nJoyce chose to read from the “Anna Livia Plura­belle” sec­tion of the exper­i­men­tal text—a pas­sage “over­flow­ing,” writes Men­tal Floss, with “allu­sions to the world’s rivers.” He reads in the voice of an old wash­er­woman, and begins with a most suc­cinct state­ment of the tem­po­ral dimen­sions of lan­guage: “I told you every telling has a tail­ing.” Where Ulysses fore­grounds lit­er­ary his­to­ry, Finnegans Wake dives deep into geo­log­ic time, and priv­i­leges the oral over the writ­ten. These are the only two record­ings Joyce ever made, and they sure­ly mark what were for him cen­tral loca­tions in both books, though he also chose them for their ease of read­ing aloud and, per­haps, mem­o­riz­ing.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nJames Joyce, With His Eye­sight Fail­ing, Draws a Sketch of Leopold Bloom (1926)\nSylvia Beach Tells the Sto­ry of Found­ing Shake­speare and Com­pa­ny, Pub­lish­ing Joyce’s Ulysses, Sell­ing Copies of Hemingway’s First Book & More (1962)\nHear All of Finnegans Wake Read Aloud: A 35 Hour Read­ing\nWhat Makes James Joyce’s Ulysses a Mas­ter­piece: Great Books Explained\nVir­ginia Woolf on James Joyce’s Ulysses, “Nev­er Did Any Book So Bore Me.” Shen Then Quit at Page 200\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Education, Math |   \tJanuary 7th, 2026  3 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWilliam Gib­son famous­ly observed that the future is already here, it’s just not even­ly dis­trib­uted. That line is often thought to have been inspired by Japan, which was already pro­ject­ing a thor­ough­ly futur­is­tic image, at least in pop­u­lar cul­ture, by the time he made his debut with Neu­ro­mancer in 1984. But as any­one who’s spent enough time in the coun­try under­stands — albeit not with­out frus­tra­tion — even twen­ty-first-cen­tu­ry Japan remains in many ways a pre-dig­i­tal soci­ety. Many busi­ness­es only take cash, more than a few ser­vices require com­mu­ni­ca­tion by fax, and there’s no sub­sti­tute for a phys­i­cal han­ko seal on impor­tant doc­u­ments. Even so, it may come as a sur­prise to learn that Japan still uses aba­cus­es.\nOr rather, Japan still uses aba­cus­es as edu­ca­tion­al tools: you won’t see many shop­keep­ers pull them out while ring­ing up your pur­chas­es, but if you glance in the win­dow of the right kind of pri­vate acad­e­my, you might well see young stu­dents furi­ous­ly per­form­ing cal­cu­la­tions the very old-fash­ioned way.\nIf they’re suf­fi­cient­ly advanced, as explained in the BBC video above, they won’t even have actu­al aba­cus­es; they’ll just move around beads pic­tured in their heads. (It brings to mind how Dustin Hoff­man’s savant in Rain Man explains his per­for­mance of seem­ing­ly impos­si­ble men­tal math: “I see it.”) Such inten­sive aba­cus edu­ca­tion was com­mon across north­east Asia in the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, when the arith­metic skills it cul­ti­vat­ed were impor­tant for both indi­vid­ual sur­vival and nation­al devel­op­ment.\nIt was that very devel­op­ment that tend­ed to push the aba­cus into obso­les­cence. When Korea, where I live, could afford elec­tron­ic cal­cu­la­tors, the pres­tige asso­ci­at­ed with aba­cus mas­tery dis­solved prac­ti­cal­ly overnight. Deter­mined Kore­an par­ents can still sign their chil­dren up for jupan class­es, much as Chi­nese par­ents might encour­age theirs to enter into suan­pan com­pe­ti­tions out of a sense of civ­i­liza­tion­al pride, but they have noth­ing like the sta­tus the soroban enjoys in Japan. That may be vin­di­cat­ed by neu­ro­sci­en­tif­ic research point­ing toward the ben­e­fits learn­ing the aba­cus can have on a devel­op­ing brain’s cog­ni­tive func­tions. As the BBC video explains, aba­cus train­ing enhances cog­ni­tive func­tion by sharp­en­ing con­cen­tra­tion, accel­er­at­ing infor­ma­tion pro­cess­ing, and strength­en­ing visu­al mem­o­ry, lead­ing to improved mem­o­ry and sus­tained focus. But as any enthu­si­ast of Japan­ese craft cul­ture knows, no mat­ter how much hard­er it may be to do things with ana­log tools, some­times it’s just more sat­is­fy­ing.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nFree Online Math Cours­es\nThe Won­der­ful Wood­en Mar­ble Adding Machine\nThe Math­e­mat­ics Behind Origa­mi, the Ancient Japan­ese Art of Paper Fold­ing\nCom­plex Math Made Sim­ple With Engag­ing Ani­ma­tions: Fouri­er Trans­form, Cal­cu­lus, Lin­ear Alge­bra, Neur­al Net­works & More\nJapan­ese Musi­cians Turn Obso­lete Machines Into Musi­cal Instru­ments: Cath­ode Ray Tube TVs, Over­head Pro­jec­tors, Reel-to-Reel Tape Machines & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThibaut Grevet is a French director and photographer who moves through the world with an eye tuned to the unseen. His images slip between reality and reverie, blending people, architecture, and landscape into quiet collisions of shape, shadow, and motion. What he captures often feels less like documentation and more like memory—soft, shifting, and charged with an otherworldly calm.\nGrevet works in moments that unfold on their own terms: unposed, unpolished, and beautifully transient. He gravitates toward what flickers at the edge of perception, revealing details that many overlook but that, in his hands, expand into entire worlds. His 2025–26 collaboration with New York City Ballet extends this dialogue between space and sensation.\nGrevet’s work will be on view at three special New York City Ballet Art Series performances on January 28, January 31, and February 6. The evenings will include a performance, viewing of the installation, and an afterparty, with all tickets priced at $54.\nTo learn more and purchase tickets, visit nycballet.com/artseries.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDutch photographer Pieter Henket has spent the past few years spotlighting the innovative and subversive fashionings of Mexico City’s queer communities. After a lengthy period in the capital, he teamed up with stylist Chino Castilla to create portraits of dancers, performers, and even locals he encountered while strolling through the park. Together, they wanted to highlight “the boundaries between Mexico’s deeply rooted Catholic traditions and the freedom of modern self-expression,” Henket says.\nResulting is a captivating collection that defies notions of cultural identity, gender, sexuality, and even queerness itself. Shot in black and white, Birds of Mexico City zeroes in on the textures of cracked walls and peeling paint lining the weathered space and the particulars of the subjects’ garments. Frilly, lace pleats, a shock of dried foliage, and masks trimmed with fringe both accentuate and obscure the figures’ bodies, while presenting an exuberant aesthetic of contrast.\n“Otokani”\nIn “Fuerza,” for example, a clean-cut muscular figure flexes in leopard-print thigh-highs and heels, a juxtaposition echoed in “Raul,” which features a demure young person revealing soccer attire underneath a corsetted gown. “Chisme” similarly documents a seated figure sporting both a flower crown and a Luchador mask.\nAs corporations co-opt Pride and attempt to position rainbow hues as synonymous with queerness, Henket’s decision to strip the images of color requires the viewer to go beyond a surface-level reading of what it means to express one’s identity. The portraits are also at once expansive and local: they incorporate unusual materials like twigs and gilded frames, yet are deeply rooted in their regional context through accessories like the Luchador masks.\nStriking in composition and message, Birds of Mexico City offers a glimpse into a flourishing community redefining queerness and belonging. The collection, Henket adds, “speaks to freedom, identity, and resilience, revealed through the quiet beauty I found in Mexico City.”\nThe entire series will be released in a monograph this spring from Damiani, and you can pre-order a copy on Bookshop.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nKnown for his meticulous drawings of insects, birds, and other creatures hybridized with mechanical gears and intricate filigree, Steeven Salvat has a penchant for detail. Often tapping into historical analog technology like clocks, typewriters, globes, and hourglasses, the artist nods nostalgically to a pre-digital age.\nSalvat’s forthcoming exhibition, Latitude/Longitude at Galerie Hamon, continues the artist’s interest in the convergence of nature and human activity. This recent body of work, created using acrylic and Chinese ink, focuses more specifically on navigation and cartography. Vintage maps, charts, and globes provide the foundation for beautiful renderings of songbirds and butterflies in a meditation on migration.\n\nIn light of the current climate crisis, migratory patterns of a wide range of creatures—from monarch butterflies to terns to gray whales—are at increased risk of disruption due to shifts in the timing of seasonal changes, habitat destruction, and more extreme weather. Salvat looks to the past as a means of thinking more critically about the inherent beauty and vulnerability of birds. \n“I work on carefully sourced antique maps and navigation objects such as compasses, barometers, and globes, using them as starting points to paint different bird species,” Salvat says. “These works reflect instinctive trajectories and the memory of invisible journeys. Together, they create an immersive space, somewhere between a map room and a contemporary cabinet of curiosities.”\nLatitude/Longitude runs from February 6 to March 4 in Le Havre, France.

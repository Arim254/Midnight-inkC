    "body": "\n\tin Animation, Film, Music |   \tNovember 11th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nYou could argue that, of all rock bands, that Pink Floyd had the least need for visu­al accom­pa­ni­ment. Son­i­cal­ly rich and evoca­tive­ly struc­tured, their albums evolved to offer lis­ten­ing expe­ri­ences that verge on the cin­e­mat­ic in them­selves. Yet from fair­ly ear­ly in the Floy­d’s his­to­ry, their artis­tic ambi­tions extend­ed to that which could not be heard. Can you real­ly under­stand their enter­prise, it’s fair to ask, if you remain mere­ly one of their lis­ten­ers, nev­er enter­ing the visu­al dimen­sion — not just their album cov­ers, repro­duc­tions of which still grace many a dorm room wall, but also their elab­o­rate stage shows, music videos (which they were mak­ing before that form had a name), and films? One man had more respon­si­bil­i­ty for the devel­op­ment of the Floy­d’s visu­al style than any oth­er: Ian Emes.\nIn 1972, Emes took it upon him­self to ani­mate their song “One of These Days” from the pre­vi­ous year’s album Med­dle. When the fin­ished work, “French Win­dows,” aired on the BBC music show The Old Grey Whis­tle Test, it caught the eye of the Floy­d’s key­board play­er Rick Wright. The group then got in touch with Emes, ask­ing to use “French Win­dows” as a pro­jec­tion behind their con­certs.\nThey went on to com­mis­sion fur­ther work from him, for songs like “Speak to Me,” Time,” and “On the Run” from The Dark Side of the Moon. This pro­fes­sion­al con­nec­tion endured for decades. When Roger Waters put on his own per­for­mances of The Wall — includ­ing the enor­mous­ly scaled show in Berlin in 1990 — he had Emes direct its ani­mat­ed sequences. The post-Waters ver­sion of Pink Floyd even called up Emes in 2015 to ask him to make a film to accom­pa­ny their final album The End­less Riv­er.\n\n\n\t\n\nIt was, in a way, the com­ple­tion of a cir­cle: “One of These Days” is a most­ly instru­men­tal song, and The End­less Riv­er is a most­ly instru­men­tal album; “French Win­dows” uses roto­scop­ing, which involves trac­ing over live action footage to make more real­is­ti­cal­ly smooth ani­ma­tion, and the End­less Riv­er film presents its own live action footage in a man­ner that some­times verges on the abstract. Both works cre­ate their own visu­al envi­ron­ments, which dove­tails with what Emes, who died two years ago, once described as the appeal for him of the Floyd: “They went to archi­tec­ture col­lege and so I think their music cre­ates spaces. It cre­ates envi­ron­ments of sound and I was so stim­u­lat­ed that my mind would soar, and so I would see images that were stim­u­lat­ed by the music.” Their music takes a dif­fer­ent form before the mind’s eye of each fan, but it was Emes who made his visions a part of their lega­cy.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nPsy­che­del­ic Scenes of Pink Floyd’s Ear­ly Days with Syd Bar­rett, 1967\nPink Floyd Films a Con­cert in an Emp­ty Audi­to­ri­um, Still Try­ing to Break Into the U.S. Charts (1970)\nPink Floyd’s First Mas­ter­piece: An Audio/Video Explo­ration of the 23-Minute Track, “Echoes” (1971)\nDown­load Pink Floyd’s 1975 Com­ic Book Pro­gram for The Dark Side of the Moon Tour\nThe First Pro­fes­sion­al Footage of Pink Floyd Gets Cap­tured in a 1967 Doc­u­men­tary (and the Band Also Pro­vides the Sound­track)\nHow Pink Floyd Built The Wall: The Album, Tour & Film\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin History, Photography |   \tNovember 12th, 2025  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\nYou’ve like­ly heard the rea­son peo­ple nev­er smile in very old pho­tographs. Ear­ly pho­tog­ra­phy could be an excru­ci­at­ing­ly slow process. With expo­sure times of up to 15 min­utes, por­trait sub­jects found it impos­si­ble to hold a grin, which could eas­i­ly slip into a pained gri­mace and ruin the pic­ture. A few min­utes rep­re­sent­ed a marked improve­ment on the time it took to make the very first pho­to­graph, Nicéphore Niépce’s 1826 “heli­o­graph.” Cap­tur­ing the shapes of light and shad­ow out­side his win­dow, Niépce’s image “required an eight-hour expo­sure,” notes the Chris­t­ian Sci­ence Mon­i­tor, “long enough that the sun­light reflects off both sides of the build­ings.”\nNiépce’s busi­ness and invent­ing part­ner is much more well-known: Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre, who went on after Niépce’s death in 1833 to devel­op the Daguerreo­type process, patent­ing it in 1839. That same year, the first self­ie was born. And the year pri­or Daguerre him­self took what most believe to be the very first pho­to­graph of a human, in a street scene of the Boule­vard du Tem­ple in Paris. The image shows us one of Daguerre’s ear­ly suc­cess­ful attempts at image-mak­ing, in which, writes NPR’s Robert Krul­wich, “he exposed a chem­i­cal­ly treat­ed met­al plate for ten min­utes. Oth­ers were walk­ing or rid­ing in car­riages down that busy street that day, but because they moved, they didn’t show up.”\nVis­i­ble, how­ev­er, in the low­er left quad­rant is a man stand­ing with his hands behind his back, one leg perched on a plat­form. A clos­er look reveals the fuzzy out­line of the per­son shin­ing his boots. A much fin­er-grained analy­sis of the pho­to­graph shows what may be oth­er, less dis­tinct fig­ures, includ­ing what looks like two women with a cart or pram, a child’s face in a win­dow, and var­i­ous oth­er passers­by. The pho­to­graph marks a his­tor­i­cal­ly impor­tant peri­od in the devel­op­ment of the medi­um, one in which pho­tog­ra­phy passed from curios­i­ty to rev­o­lu­tion­ary tech­nol­o­gy for both artists and sci­en­tists.\n\nAlthough Daguerre had been work­ing on a reli­able method since the 1820s, it wasn’t until 1838, the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Muse­um of Art explains, that his “con­tin­ued exper­i­ments pro­gressed to the point where he felt com­fort­able show­ing exam­ples of the new medi­um to select­ed artists and sci­en­tists in the hope of lin­ing up investors.” Photography’s most pop­u­lar 19th cen­tu­ry use—perhaps then as now—was as a means of cap­tur­ing faces. But Daguerre’s ear­li­est plates “were still life com­po­si­tions of plas­ter casts after antique sculp­ture,” lend­ing “the ‘aura’ of art to pic­tures made by mechan­i­cal means.” He also took pho­tographs of shells and fos­sils, demon­strat­ing the medium’s util­i­ty for sci­en­tif­ic pur­pos­es.\nIf por­traits were per­haps less inter­est­ing to Daguerre’s investors, they were essen­tial to his suc­ces­sors and admir­ers. Can­did shots of peo­ple mov­ing about their dai­ly lives as in this Paris street scene, how­ev­er, proved next to impos­si­ble for sev­er­al more decades. What was for­mer­ly believed to be the old­est such pho­to­graph, an 1848 image from Cincin­nati, shows what appears to be two men stand­ing at the edge of the Ohio Riv­er. It seems as though they’ve come to fetch water, but they must have been stand­ing very still to have appeared so clear­ly. Pho­tog­ra­phy seemed to stop time, freez­ing a sta­t­ic moment for­ev­er in phys­i­cal form. Blurred images of peo­ple mov­ing through the frame expose the illu­sion. Even in the stillest, stiffest of images, there is move­ment, an insight Ead­weard Muy­bridge would make cen­tral to his exper­i­ments in motion pho­tog­ra­phy just a few decades after Daguerre debuted his world-famous method.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe First Pho­to­graph Ever Tak­en (1826)\nThe First “Self­ie” In His­to­ry Tak­en by Robert Cor­nelius, a Philadel­phia Chemist, in 1839\nEad­weard Muybridge’s Motion Pho­tog­ra­phy Exper­i­ments from the 1870s Pre­sent­ed in 93 Ani­mat­ed Gifs\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nIt may well be that the major piv­ot points of his­to­ry are only vis­i­ble to those around the bend. For those of us immersed in the present—for all of its deaf­en­ing sirens of vio­lent upheaval—the exact years future gen­er­a­tions will use to mark our epoch remain unclear. But when we look back, cer­tain years stand out above all oth­ers, those that his­to­ri­ans use as arrest­ing­ly sin­gu­lar book titles: 1066: The Year of Con­quest, 1492: The Year the World Began, 1776. The first such year in the 20th cen­tu­ry gets a par­tic­u­lar­ly grim sub­ti­tle in his­to­ri­an Paul Ham’s 1914: The Year the World End­ed.\nIt sounds like hyper­bol­ic mar­ket­ing, but that apoc­a­lyp­tic descrip­tion of the effects of World War I comes from some of the most elo­quent voic­es of the age, whether those of Amer­i­can expa­tri­ates like Gertrude Stein or T.S. Eliot, or of Euro­pean sol­dier-poets like Wil­fred Owen or Siegfried Sas­soon.\nIn France, the hor­rors of the war prompt­ed its sur­vivors to remem­ber the years before it as La Belle Epoque, a phrase—wrote the BBC’s Hugh Schofield in the cen­te­nary essay “La Belle Eqoque: Paris 1914,”—that appeared “much lat­er in the cen­tu­ry, when peo­ple who’d lived their gild­ed youths in the pre-war years start­ed look­ing back and rem­i­nisc­ing.”\n\nWe’re used to see­ing the peri­od of 1914 in grainy, drea­ry black-and-white, and to see­ing nos­tal­gic cel­e­bra­tions of La Belle Epoque rep­re­sent­ed graph­i­cal­ly by the live­ly full-col­or posters and adver­tise­ments one finds in décor stores. But thanks to the full col­or pho­tos you see here, we can see pho­tographs of World War I‑era Paris in full and vibrant color—images of the city 110 years ago almost just as Parisians saw it at the time. Icons like the Moulin Rouge come to life in bright day­light, above, and light­ing up the night, below.\n\nEar­ly cin­e­ma Aubert Palace, below, in the Grands Boule­vards, shim­mers beau­ti­ful­ly, as does the art-deco light­ing of the Eif­fel Tow­er, fur­ther down.\n\n\nBelow, hot air bal­loons hov­er in the enor­mous Grand Palais, and fur­ther down, a pho­to­graph of Notre Dame on a hazy day almost looks like a water­col­or.\n\n\nThe pho­tographs were made, writes Messy N Chic, “using Autochrome Lumière tech­nol­o­gy between 1914 and 1918 [a tech­nique devel­oped in 1903 by the Lumière broth­ers, cred­it­ed as the first film­mak­ers]…. [T]here are around 72,000 Autochromes from the time peri­od of places all over the world, includ­ing Paris in its true col­ors.”\n\n\nNot all of the pho­tographs are of famous archi­tec­tur­al mon­u­ments or nightlife des­ti­na­tions. Very many show ordi­nary street scenes, like those above, one depict­ing a num­ber of bored French sol­diers, pre­sum­ably await­ing deploy­ment.\n\nThe Paris of 1914 was a Euro­pean cap­i­tal in major tran­si­tion, in more ways than one. “Moder­ni­ty was the mov­ing spir­it,” writes Schofield; “It was the time of the machine. The city’s last horse-drawn omnibus made its way from Saint-Sulpice to La Vil­lette in Jan­u­ary 1913.”\n\n\nSchofield also points out that, like Gild­ed Age New York, “the pub­lic image of Paris was the cre­ation of roman­tic cap­i­tal­ists. The real­i­ty for many was much more wretched… there were entire fam­i­lies liv­ing on the street, and decrepit, over­crowd­ed hous­ing with nonex­is­tent san­i­ta­tion.”\n\nModer­ni­ty was leav­ing many behind, class con­flict loomed in France as it erupt­ed in Rus­sia, even as the glob­al cat­a­stro­phe of World War I threat­ened French elites and pro­le­tari­at alike, who both served and who both died at very high rates.\n\nYou can see many more of these aston­ish­ing­ly beau­ti­ful full-col­or pho­tographs of 1914 Paris—at the end of La Belle Epoque—at Vin­tage Every­day and Messy N Chic.\n\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2015.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nParis Had a Mov­ing Side­walk in 1900, and a Thomas Edi­son Film Cap­tured It in Action\nPris­tine Footage Lets You Revis­it Life in Paris in the 1890s: Watch Footage Shot by the Lumière Broth­ers\nParis in Beau­ti­ful Col­or Images from 1890: The Eif­fel Tow­er, Notre Dame, The Pan­théon, and More (1890)\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\tin Film, Music |   \tNovember 12th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nEach of us has a dif­fer­ent idea of when, exact­ly, the six­ties end­ed, not as a decade, but as a dis­tinct cul­tur­al peri­od. Some have a notion of the “long six­ties” that extends well into the sev­en­ties; if pressed for a spe­cif­ic final year, they could do worse than point­ing to 1972, when David Bowie made his epoch-shift­ing appear­ance as Zig­gy Star­dust, backed by the Spi­ders from Mars, on the BBC’s Top of the Pops. It was also the year he released music videos for “Space Odd­i­ty,” the sin­gle that had begun to make his name at the time of the moon land­ing in 1969, and “Jean Genie,” the first sin­gle from Aladdin Sane, an album inspired in part by the debauch­ery of the Amer­i­can Zig­gy tour he under­took after blast­ing off into star­dom.\n\n\n\t\n\n\nHav­ing strug­gled in the six­ties to find a suit­able iden­ti­ty and audi­ence, the young Bowie devel­oped an unusu­al­ly strong under­stand­ing of not just the music indus­try, but also the cul­ture itself. One era was giv­ing way to anoth­er, and nobody knew it bet­ter than he did. When all those hir­sute fig­ures in beards and den­im, singing with osten­ta­tious earnest­ness about love and free­dom, dis­ap­peared, who would replace them?\nIn Bowie’s vision, the next phase belonged to clean-shaven, made-up androg­y­nes in flam­boy­ant design­er cos­tumes work­ing grand, some­times sci­ence fic­tion­al, and often inscrutable themes into what would strike con­cert­go­ers as almost com­plete the­atri­cal expe­ri­ences — and he would be the first and fore­most among them.\n\n\n\t\n\nBowie, in oth­er words, made the sev­en­ties his own, oper­at­ing on his knowl­edge of and instincts about the media envi­ron­ment of that decade and how images would be made in it. By that time, he’d seen too many flash­es in the pan of pop music to get com­pla­cent about his own prospects for endurance. The recep­tion of “Space Odd­i­ty” as a nov­el­ty song did its part to moti­vate him to come up with his bisex­u­al space-alien rock-star alter ego — and to moti­vate him to ter­mi­nate that per­sona on stage in 1973. A cou­ple of years before that, he had already sung of the impor­tance of changes, a kind of man­i­festo that would guide his career through all the decades that remained. Nev­er would Bowie adhere to a par­tic­u­lar musi­cal or aes­thet­ic style for very long, an abid­ing ten­den­cy vivid­ly on dis­play in this playlist of 50 music videos on his offi­cial YouTube chan­nel.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe expe­ri­ence of putting out music videos in the sev­en­ties placed Bowie well, espe­cial­ly com­pared to oth­er artists of his gen­er­a­tion, to make his mark on MTV in the eight­ies with a sta­di­um-ready hit like “Let’s Dance.” The nineties found him tak­ing the form in new direc­tions, as with the cinephili­cal­ly astute video for “Jump They Say” and the dar­ing­ly action-free visu­al treat­ment of the reflec­tive “Thurs­day’s Child” (from the album Hours…, which began as the sound­track to the com­put­er game Omikron: The Nomad Soul). Apart from this playlist, his chan­nel also con­tains music videos for his lat­er songs from the two-thou­sands and twen­ty-tens, from “New Killer Star” to “The Stars (Are Out Tonight)” to “Black­star” — the nature of star­dom hav­ing been a pre­oc­cu­pa­tion since the begin­ning, even though he kept on chang­ing to the very end.\n\n\n\t\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWatch David Bowie Star in His First Film Role, a Short Hor­ror Flick Called The Image (1967)\nWatch David Bowie Per­form “Star­man” on Top of the Pops: Vot­ed the Great­est Music Per­for­mance Ever on the BBC (1972)\nDavid Bowie Per­forms “Life on Mars?” and “Ash­es to Ash­es” on John­ny Carson’s “Tonight Show” (1980)\nDavid Bowie’s Music Video “Jump They Say” Pays Trib­ute to Marker’s La Jetée, Godard’s Alphav­ille, Welles’ The Tri­al & Kubrick’s 2001\nWatch David Bowie’s New Video for “The Stars (Are Out Tonight)” With Til­da Swin­ton\nWhen Bowie & Jagger’s “Danc­ing in the Street” Music Video Becomes a Silent Film\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

This is especially apropos when it comes to celebrating culture, heritage, and a sense of belonging for “a new generation of Africans who embrace the multiplicity of their heritage in a globalized world,” says a statement for his new project, Of Colour.\nGuibinga taps into color as a means of communication—a language that can be used for storytelling, conveying emotions, and embodying symbols of identity. Saturated hues and the interplay of light and shadow reflect “joy, pride, and the complexity of Black experience.”\n\nThrough bold, large-scale portraits, Guibinga says that he aims “to explore how colour carries emotion and identity, expanding my ongoing work on contemporary African representation.” Presented in collaboration with Los Angeles-based media company StandardVision, Of Colour comprises several vibrant compositions by the Montréal-based artist that alternate across eight billboards throughout November.\nSee more on his website and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFrom cut, notched, perforated, and layered pieces of metallic coated paper, Michael Velliquette conceives of alluring geometric motifs. Known for his mandala-like compositions that sometimes rise tower-like from their bases or appear to rotate with multiple circular layers, he continues to explore “the subtle terrain of interiority,” says a statement for his new show.\nThe Light That Sees, Velliquette’s solo exhibition of 21 new works at Duane Reed Gallery, delves into themes of consciousness and light, both in the physical sense that light enables us to see but also in the way that illumination is itself a metaphor for awareness—and enlightenment. Through monochromatic reliefs, he highlights perception, material, and the human relationship with nature.\n“I Am the Sky” (2025), metallic coated cover stock, 12 x 12 x 2 inches\nVelliquette often repeats specific shapes, such as eyes, stars, florets, and circles. Numerous other shapes frequently come into play, from hole-punched triangles to myriad tiny discs with scalloped edges. Sometimes, the overall composition reads as a meditation on recurring forms, like a mandala, in which all sides are essentially the same. In others, elements bordering on the cartoonish emerge in the form of flowers with faces or human profiles rotating around a central orb.\nA statement says, “Through acts of repetition and precision—cutting, shaping, and assembling complex layers and shapes—Velliquette’s paper sculptures serve as meditative objects that ask the viewer not just to look, but to see—to meet the work with a quiet awareness that mirrors its making.”\nThe Light That Sees continues through December 13 in St. Louis.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe poetic idea that “doors are the architecture of intimacy” grounds a new installation by Portuguese artist Alexandre Farto, a.k.a. Vhils (previously). Against the stunning desert backdrop of the Pyramids of Giza, “Doors of Cairo” is a site-specific work featuring a layered collection of Vhils’ distinctive etched portraits. Faces peer out from the weathered structures, some of which nest in the sand while others tower above on scaffolding.\nContrasting the ancient tombs with an installation that will dot the landscape for just a month, Vhils explores the ways we mark the world and how our imprints endure over time. “The pyramids were built for kings and gods, meant to last forever. My installation is made from wood and memory, and it will soon disappear,” he says. “Yet both belong to the same human impulse, to build, to remember, to leave a trace.”\n\n“Doors of Cairo” is part of the fifth Forever Is Now project, an ongoing exhibition curated by Art D’Égypte with the support of UNESCO. Vhils is the first Portuguese artist invited to participate in the project, and he tethers his homeland to the historic site. All 65 repurposed doors were sourced from demolition sites and renovation projects between the two countries, and each bears traces of former use, whether chipped paint, scuffed surfaces, or faint fingerprints that linger in a well-worn spot.\nThe fragmented portraits don’t depict anyone specific but rather function as stand-ins for people past and present. “A single face can represent one person, but it can also stand for a community, a generation, or a shared emotional landscape,” the artist says. “It speaks to how people and places are inseparable, how memory becomes embedded in matter, and how identity is built from many invisible layers.”\nAfter six months of carving in his studio—and creating a smaller, sculptural iteration that will live beyond the outdoor installation—Vhils spent three days working on site, shaping and reshaping the composition. “It evolved intuitively, door by door, guided by their scale, texture, and rhythm,” he shares. “This project is a dialogue between the everyday and the eternal, between the wooden doors of ordinary lives and the stone pyramids that have outlasted civilisations. It is a reminder that even what is temporary can carry the weight of time.”\n“Doors of Cairo” is on view through December 7. Find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

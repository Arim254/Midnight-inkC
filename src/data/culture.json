    "body": "\n\tin Art, Life |   \tJanuary 9th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nTrevor Noah end­ed his stint as the host of The Dai­ly Show a lit­tle over three years ago, but he’s made him­self into anoth­er kind of pop-cul­tur­al pres­ence since then. In evi­dence, we have his appear­ance above on the pop­u­lar pod­cast and YouTube show Diary of a CEO. For more than two and a half hours, Noah dis­cuss­es with host Steven Bartlett (who, like Noah, also hap­pens to be African-born with mixed parent­age) his rea­sons for quit­ting that polit­i­cal-news-com­e­dy TV insti­tu­tion, his strug­gles with depres­sion, and the time his step­fa­ther shot his moth­er in the head. She lived, owing to the mirac­u­lous­ly unlike­ly tra­jec­to­ry of the bul­let, but that did­n’t stop the expe­ri­ence from becom­ing what Noah describes as the worst of his life.\nDis­cussing all this brings to his mind the Japan­ese art of kintsu­gi (pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture). “It’s a prac­tice of repair­ing pot­tery and ceram­ics that have bro­ken,” Noah explains. “What hap­pens is, you break a plate, or you break a vase or some­thing,” and “they put it back togeth­er, these arti­sans who do it. But they don’t just glue it back togeth­er, they glue it back togeth­er and they sort of adorn it with a gold­en bind­ing. And what you get is an object that is some­how more beau­ti­ful than before it was bro­ken.”\nKintsu­gi struck him as “one of the most beau­ti­ful con­cepts, and a dif­fer­ent way to think about being ‘fixed’ or ‘over­com­ing’ ”; it was­n’t “the idea that we are per­fect, the way we were before some­thing hap­pened to us, but rather, it is that we get to wear our cracks with a new type of pride, and a new type of beau­ty.”\nNoah would hard­ly be the only per­son to see in these recon­sti­tut­ed ceram­ic ves­sels with their gleam­ing kintsu­gi seams a metaphor for him­self. Like more than a few pub­lic fig­ures in the West, he’s been will­ing to dis­cuss the vicis­si­tudes of his life in detail, and even use them for mate­r­i­al in work like his stand-up com­e­dy and his mem­oir Born a Crime. But it is unusu­al, in a chat like this with mil­lions and mil­lions of view­ers, to hear ref­er­ence made to a half-mil­len­ni­um-old Japan­ese form of pot­tery repair. That pos­si­bil­i­ty, of course, is cen­tral to the appeal of long-form inter­view pod­casts, whose con­ver­sa­tions have the time and space to go far down unex­pect­ed paths. The Dai­ly Show may deliv­er more laughs per minute, but giv­en its for­mat’s time con­straints, kintsu­gi-type talk is no doubt the first thing to get edit­ed out — and the cut cer­tain­ly won’t be high­light­ed.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nA Visu­al Intro­duc­tion to Kintsu­gi, the Japan­ese Art of Repair­ing Bro­ken Pot­tery and Find­ing Beau­ty in Imper­fec­tion\nHow Japan­ese Kintsu­gi Mas­ters Restore Pot­tery by Beau­ti­fy­ing the Cracks\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nStanford’s Robert Sapol­sky Demys­ti­fies Depres­sion, Which, Like Dia­betes, Is Root­ed in Biol­o­gy\nStephen Fry on Cop­ing with Depres­sion: It’s Rain­ing, But the Sun Will Come Out Again\nCharles Bukows­ki Explains How to Beat Depres­sion: Spend 3–4 Days in Bed and You’ll Get the Juices Flow­ing Again (NSFW)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nThe world’s largest island that isn’t its own continent, Greenland spans more than 836,000 square miles. As we’ve been reminded recently, the territory is part of the Realm of Denmark, although it has its own systems of local government. Greenland is home to only about 56,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Inuit and live on the southern part of the island that’s not covered in ice. The largest city, Nuuk, houses around one-third of the country’s population. And situated just south of the Arctic Circle, residents only see a few hours of sunlight during the day in mid-winter.\nHunting and fishing have traditionally sustained a subsistence lifestyle for Greenlanders, and today, the latter continues as the foundation of the nation’s economy. It’s a stunning island, with dramatic mountains, fjords, and rocky coastlines. For photographer Dennis Lehtonen, who moved to Greenland in early 2023 and found work in its fish factories, the inherent beauty of the region is endlessly enchanting.\nNarsamijit\nLehtonen captures atmospheric images of distinctive landscapes and tiny villages, like when a pair of monumental icebergs floated by one community earlier this year. He illuminates the vernacular architecture and remote, rugged beauty of the country while drawing attention to changing demographics.\nLike many places around the world, populations are declining in rural, small towns due to younger people moving away to larger cities for different job opportunities, creating a domino effect of industry decline in smaller settlements. In many areas, a number of homes stand abandoned, and since the mid-20th century, a few ghost towns have emerged.\nUsing a drone, Lehtonen captures these otherworldly places where time-honored traditions confront our contemporary, globalized world. He aims to photograph all of the approximately 70 inhabited places in Greenland, creating a kind of poignant record.\n“With many young people moving to a few bigger cities, it means that many smaller, remote places experience severe depopulation,” Lehtonen says. “It’s therefore highly realistic that some places I have lived in will be closed as I get older.” See more on Instagram.\nKullorsuaq\nSavissivik\nTasiusaq\nSiorapaluk\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn an otherwise unassuming neighborhood in Beppu, Ōita Prefecture, Japan, a modest residence has undergone an unusual transformation. Thanks to Japanese art collective 目, the two-story private home has been hollowed out, in a sense, to create a literal cavern.\n目 translates to “eye” and is pronounced “mé,” and the group comprises artist Haruka Kojin, director Kenji Minamigawa, and installer Hirofumi Masui. The trio’s focus revolves around conceiving works that encourage new ways of seeing the world as it constantly changes and evolves before us. Often playing with perception, pieces have included ocean swells that appear frozen in time and space and giant balloons of people’s faces that float above urban centers.\n\n“Space II” sits in a residential neighborhood of a city renowned for its natural hot springs, known as onsen, which attract visitors to local resorts. Tapping into the geological and geothermal character of the area, 目 has created an otherworldly installation resembling a cave reminiscent of tourist attractions with metal steps and railings. Gaping holes in the exterior make it appear as if the structure was carved from rock to look like a house rather than the other way around.\n“Space II” is a continuation of a theme begun with a piece called “Space” in 2020, in which 目 constructed a narrow, contemporary exhibition space in the second story of an otherwise typical home in the city of Aomori. Visitors will be able to step inside of “Space II,” with reservations slated to open on 目’s website later this month. Follow updates on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nBy marrying the realistic with the fantastical and uncanny, Stephanie Temma Hier conjures tension: there’s a calf-hair necktie that morphs into a table fan, popcorn surrounding pink ballet shoes, and a rapt snake framed by orange igneous rocks.\nThe Brooklyn-based artist is formally trained as a painter and self-taught as a ceramicist, and she fuses the two modes of working into a complementary practice. Hier begins by sculpting a wide range of forms, and after several rounds of firing with both handmade and commercially available glazes, she adds a painting. The pairings arise intuitively, sometimes through free association, trial and error, or by homing in on a color.\n\nEarlier works include a decadent, three-tiered cake piped not with pillowy buttercream but instead trimmed with olives, sausages, and thin slices of prosciutto. There’s also a thick head of green cabbage that reveals a trio of ravenous chicks roosted in its core. While the artist’s depictions in both clay and paint are lifelike, the juxtapositions push the works firmly into the realm of the surreal and ambiguous.\nMany of the works shown here will debut this month at Anton Kern Gallery for Hier’s solo exhibition, Swan Song. Nodding to the ancient Greek belief that the otherwise “mute” birds sing just before their deaths, the exhibition takes transformation as its starting point. Elements of Dutch still lifes appear, too, as flowers bloom and pastries and coffee are consumed across a picnic-esque surface.\nHier created the Swan Song pieces simultaneously, allowing motifs and themes to recur throughout. The titular bird, for example, appears in several works, from the feathered chair with thick, stocky webbed legs to the intimate portrait encircled by an array of speckled shoes. Together, the mixed-media pieces create a sort of domestic tableau that unsettles in its familiarity, presenting a fantastic world in which the only inevitabilities are the unexpected and change.\nSwan Song is on view from January 14 to February 21 in New York. Find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 1666, the marriage of Emperor Leopold I and Infanta Margarita Teresa of Spain solidified a political alliance between the Austrian and Spanish sides of the Habsburg family. They were also both uncle and niece and first cousins, such was the intense insularity of royal marriages intended to gain or maintain power across Europe.\nThe union was arranged while Margarita Teresa was very young—she was only around 15 when they married—and during the years leading up to the wedding, court painter Diego Velázquez created numerous portraits of her, which were sent to Leopold I in the form of tokens or updates documenting the imperial bride’s development into a young woman. \n“Them, after Hodges, Kruseman, Batoni and Skirving” (2022-25), oil on linen in four individually framed ovals, dimensions variable: medium 7.5 x 9.5 centimeters; large 9 x 11.9 centimeters\nFor Derrick Guild, portraits of the likes of the Infanta and the Spanish royal family, such as Velázquez’s seminal “Las Meninas,” provide the starting point for a painting practice that examines social status, mores, and expectations. Through 17th- and 18th-century portraits, Guild examines art as a vehicle for social and diplomatic relations, considering how painting was used to impart very specific messages and emphasize prestige.\nHis “Label Infanta Margarita, after Velazquez and del Mazo,” for example, reproduces a portrait of the Spanish princess across a gridded composition of paper luggage tags, nodding to the harsh reality that the young woman’s sole role in life was to essentially be shipped off to marry well and produce heirs.\nMargarita Teresa had four children (and two miscarriages) during her six-year marriage to Leopold I. She died at the age of 22, and only one of her children lived to adulthood. The grid-like composition, set against a black background, also invokes a cage behind which the young woman is confined.\nTags are a recurring motif in Guild’s paintings, which combine trompe l’oeil details of paper and ribbon with intimate details of art historical pieces. In addition to the reference to shipping, they’re also evocative of labels used to identify and organize objects into place.\n“Label Infanta Maria Theresa, after workshop of Velázquez” (2025), oil on linen, 65 x 85 centimeters\nGuild is interested in the distortions and layered meanings of historic portraiture. Along with large-scale paintings, the artist also creates tender assemblies of smaller works in oval, gold frames, sometimes connected by gold-plated chains. Eyes are often encapsulated in their own frames, and it’s hard to escape the feeling of being watched.\nThese tiny, fragmented pieces also hone in on elegant hands, sensuous lips, jewelery, and fabrics, nodding to the tradition of painted miniatures. Often elaborately detailed for their size, these tiny portraits served as diplomatic gifts, keepsakes, tokens of love, and ways to commemorate people or events. They were a key element of introducing eligible men and women to prospective wives and husbands, and in aristocratic circles, social climbing was a not-so-hidden goal. Before photography, in the courtship scene, they were a kind of profile picture.\nIf you enjoy this work, you may also like Robyn Rich’s miniature eye pieces derived from Georgian portraits or the eccentric paintings of Volker Hermes, alongside whom Guild recently exhibited at James Freeman Gallery. See more on Guild’s work on Instagram.\n“Windsor Beauty, after Sir Peter Lely” (2025), oil on linen in five individually framed ovals and gold plate chain, dimensions variable: small 5.5 x 6.5 centimeters; medium 7.5 x 9.5 centimeters; large 9 x 11 centimeters\n“Label Velázquez, self-portrait after Velazquez” (2024), oil on canvas panel, 18 x 28 centimeters\n“History Voice 2, after Ramsay and Hodges” (2022-25), oil on linen in two oval frames, dimensions variable: each 11.9 x 9 centimeters\n“History Voice after Hodges, Lely and Danloux” (2022-25), oil on linen in three oval frames and gold plate chain, dimensions variable: medium 7.5 x 9.5 centimeters; large 9 x 11 centimeters\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Throughout the MFA program you’ll explore new techniques, refine your artistic philosophy, and gain teaching experience at one of the top universities in the United States. As a global research university, Notre Dame also offers opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and international engagement, including funding for research travel. As a tier 1 research university, Notre Dame offers students access to world-class scholars and cultural events from across the institution. Our dedicated faculty work closely with graduate students to develop their work in a supportive and critical environment augmented by a program of visiting artists, designers, critics, and art historians. With easy access to the museums and galleries of Chicago (90 minutes away by car) and museums in Indianapolis, Toledo, and Detroit within a few hours of campus, students have ample opportunity to enrich their research and practice. We offer full tuition waivers to all students admitted to the MFA program. Additionally, a $28,500 stipend is awarded to all accepted students for each year of the program. A variety of grants and awards are available for students to support travel, supplies, and other research-based costs. These resources and the relatively low cost of living in South Bend, Indiana, help us offer a terminal degree program that doesn’t burden artists and designers with significant debt. The MFA degree in studio art or design is a three-year, 60-credit program. Graduate students pursue an area of interest through a system of independent study courses with the faculty. The MFA program also allows qualified graduate students to gain college-level teaching experience during their second and third years of study. Applications for fall 2026 are due February 1. To learn more, visit artdept.nd.edu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArt Education Announcements\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSponsored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndiana\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

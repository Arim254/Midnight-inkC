    "body": "\n\tin Archaeology, Art, History |   \tJanuary 26th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImage by Ahdi Agus Okta­viana\nOver the cen­turies, a vari­ety of places have laid cred­i­ble claim to being the world’s art cen­ter: Con­stan­tino­ple, Flo­rence, Paris, New York. But on the scale of, say, ten mil­len­nia, the hot spots become rather less rec­og­niz­able. Up until about 20,000 years ago, it seems that cre­ators and view­ers of art alike spent a good deal in one par­tic­u­lar cave: Liang Metan­duno, locat­ed on Muna Island in Indone­si­a’s South­east Sulawe­si province. The many paint­ings on its walls of rec­og­niz­able humans, ani­mals, and boats have brought it fame in our times as a kind of ancient art gallery. But in recent years, a much old­er piece of work has been dis­cov­ered there, one whose cre­ation occurred at least 67,800 years ago.\nThe cre­ation in ques­tion is a hand­print, faint but detectable, prob­a­bly made by blow­ing a mix­ture of ochre and water over an actu­al human hand. To deter­mine its age, researchers per­formed what’s called ura­ni­um-series analy­sis on the deposits of cal­ci­um car­bon­ate that had built up on and around it.\nThe num­ber of 67,800 years is, of course, not exact, but it’s also just a min­i­mum: in fact, the hand­print could well be much old­er. In a paper pub­lished last week in Nature, the researchers point out that its age exceeds both that of the old­est sim­i­lar rock art found else­where in Indone­sia and that of a hand sten­cil in Spain attrib­uted to Nean­derthals, “which until now rep­re­sent­ed the old­est demon­strat­ed min­i­mum-age con­straint for cave art world­wide.”\nIt isn’t impos­si­ble that this at least 67,800-year-old hand­print could also have been made by Nean­derthals. The obvi­ous mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the hand’s shape, how­ev­er, an exten­sion and taper­ing of the fin­gers that brings to mind ani­mal claws (or the clutch­es of Nos­fer­atu), sug­gests to cer­tain sci­en­tif­ic eyes the kind of cog­ni­tion attrib­ut­able specif­i­cal­ly to Homo sapi­ens. This dis­cov­ery has great poten­tial rel­e­vance not just to art his­to­ry, but even more so to oth­er fields con­cerned with the devel­op­ment of our species. While it had pre­vi­ous­ly been thought, for instance, that the first human set­tlers of Aus­tralia made their way there through Indone­sia (in a time of much low­er sea lev­els) between 50,000 and 65,000 years ago, the hand­print­’s exis­tence in Liang Metan­duno sug­gests that the migra­tion took place even ear­li­er. All these mil­len­nia lat­er, Aus­tralia remains a favored des­ti­na­tion for a vari­ety of immi­grants — some of whom do their part to keep Syd­ney’s art scene inter­est­ing.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAlger­ian Cave Paint­ings Sug­gest Humans Did Mag­ic Mush­rooms 9,000 Years Ago\nWas a 32,000-Year-Old Cave Paint­ing the Ear­li­est Form of Cin­e­ma?\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er the World’s First “Art Stu­dio” Cre­at­ed in an Ethiopi­an Cave 43,000 Years Ago\nA Recent­ly Dis­cov­ered 44,000-Year-Old Cave Paint­ing Tells the Old­est Known Sto­ry\n40,000-Year-Old Sym­bols Found in Caves World­wide May Be the Ear­li­est Writ­ten Lan­guage\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er 200,000-Year-Old Hand & Foot­prints That Could Be the World’s Ear­li­est Cave Art\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage by Bernd Schwabe, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nAt least when I was in grade school, we learned the very basics of how the Third Reich came to pow­er in the ear­ly 1930s. Para­mil­i­tary gangs ter­ror­iz­ing the oppo­si­tion, the incom­pe­tence and oppor­tunism of Ger­man con­ser­v­a­tives, the Reich­stag Fire. And we learned about the crit­i­cal impor­tance of pro­pa­gan­da, the delib­er­ate mis­in­form­ing of the pub­lic in order to sway opin­ions en masse and achieve pop­u­lar sup­port (or at least the appear­ance of it). While Min­is­ter of Pro­pa­gan­da Joseph Goebbels purged Jew­ish and left­ist artists and writ­ers, he built a mas­sive media infra­struc­ture that played, writes PBS, “prob­a­bly the most impor­tant role in cre­at­ing an atmos­phere in Ger­many that made it pos­si­ble for the Nazis to com­mit ter­ri­ble atroc­i­ties against Jews, homo­sex­u­als, and oth­er minori­ties.”\nHow did the minor­i­ty par­ty of Hitler and Goebbels take over and break the will of the Ger­man peo­ple so thor­ough­ly that they would allow and par­tic­i­pate in mass mur­der? Post-war schol­ars of total­i­tar­i­an­ism like Theodor Adorno and Han­nah Arendt asked that ques­tion over and over, for sev­er­al decades after­ward. Their ear­li­est stud­ies on the sub­ject looked at two sides of the equa­tion. Adorno con­tributed to a mas­sive vol­ume of social psy­chol­o­gy called The Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty, which stud­ied indi­vid­u­als pre­dis­posed to the appeals of total­i­tar­i­an­ism. He invent­ed what he called the F‑Scale (“F” for “fas­cism”), one of sev­er­al mea­sures he used to the­o­rize the Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Type.\nArendt, on the oth­er hand, looked close­ly at the regimes of Hitler and Stal­in and their func­tionar­ies, at the ide­ol­o­gy of sci­en­tif­ic racism, and at the mech­a­nism of pro­pa­gan­da in fos­ter­ing “a curi­ous­ly vary­ing mix­ture of gulli­bil­i­ty and cyn­i­cism with which each mem­ber… is expect­ed to react to the chang­ing lying state­ments of the lead­ers.” So she wrote in her 1951 Ori­gins of Total­i­tar­i­an­ism, going on to elab­o­rate that this “mix­ture of gulli­bil­i­ty and cyn­i­cism… is preva­lent in all ranks of total­i­tar­i­an move­ments”:\nIn an ever-chang­ing, incom­pre­hen­si­ble world the mass­es had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe every­thing and noth­ing, think that every­thing was pos­si­ble and noth­ing was true… The total­i­tar­i­an mass lead­ers based their pro­pa­gan­da on the cor­rect psy­cho­log­i­cal assump­tion that, under such con­di­tions, one could make peo­ple believe the most fan­tas­tic state­ments one day, and trust that if the next day they were giv­en irrefutable proof of their false­hood, they would take refuge in cyn­i­cism; instead of desert­ing the lead­ers who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the state­ment was a lie and would admire the lead­ers for their supe­ri­or tac­ti­cal clev­er­ness.\nWhy the con­stant, often bla­tant lying? For one thing, it func­tioned as a means of ful­ly dom­i­nat­ing sub­or­di­nates, who would have to cast aside all their integri­ty to repeat out­ra­geous false­hoods and would then be bound to the leader by shame and com­plic­i­ty. “The great ana­lysts of truth and lan­guage in pol­i­tics”—writes McGill Uni­ver­si­ty polit­i­cal phi­los­o­phy pro­fes­sor Jacob T. Levy—includ­ing “George Orwell, Han­nah Arendt, Vaclav Havel—can help us rec­og­nize this kind of lie for what it is.… Say­ing some­thing obvi­ous­ly untrue, and mak­ing your sub­or­di­nates repeat it with a straight face in their own voice, is a par­tic­u­lar­ly star­tling dis­play of pow­er over them. It’s some­thing that was endem­ic to total­i­tar­i­an­ism.”\nArendt and oth­ers rec­og­nized, writes Levy, that “being made to repeat an obvi­ous lie makes it clear that you’re pow­er­less.” She also rec­og­nized the func­tion of an avalanche of lies to ren­der a pop­u­lace pow­er­less to resist, the phe­nom­e­non we now refer to as “gaslight­ing”:\nThe result of a con­sis­tent and total sub­sti­tu­tion of lies for fac­tu­al truth is not that the lie will now be accept­ed as truth and truth be defamed as a lie, but that the sense by which we take our bear­ings in the real world—and the cat­e­go­ry of truth ver­sus false­hood is among the men­tal means to this end—is being destroyed. \nThe epis­te­mo­log­i­cal ground thus pulled out from under them, most would depend on what­ev­er the leader said, no mat­ter its rela­tion to truth. “The essen­tial con­vic­tion shared by all ranks,” Arendt con­clud­ed, “from fel­low trav­el­er to leader, is that pol­i­tics is a game of cheat­ing and that the ‘first com­mand­ment’ of the move­ment: ‘The Fuehrer is always right,’ is as nec­es­sary for the pur­pos­es of world pol­i­tics, i.e., world-wide cheat­ing, as the rules of mil­i­tary dis­ci­pline are for the pur­pos­es of war.”\nArendt wrote Ori­gins of Total­i­tar­i­an­ism from research and obser­va­tions gath­ered dur­ing the 1940s, a very spe­cif­ic his­tor­i­cal peri­od. Nonethe­less the book, Jef­frey Isaacs remarks at The Wash­ing­ton Post, “rais­es a set of fun­da­men­tal ques­tions about how tyran­ny can arise and the dan­ger­ous forms of inhu­man­i­ty to which it can lead.” Arendt’s analy­sis of pro­pa­gan­da and the func­tion of lies seems par­tic­u­lar­ly rel­e­vant at this moment. The kinds of bla­tant lies she wrote of might become so com­mon­place as to become banal. We might begin to think they are an irrel­e­vant sideshow. This, she sug­gests, would be a mis­take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAre You a Fas­cist?: Take Theodor Adorno’s Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Test Cre­at­ed to Com­bat Fas­cism (1947)\nUmber­to Eco’s List of the 14 Com­mon Fea­tures of Fas­cism\nThe Sto­ry of Fas­cism: Rick Steves’ Doc­u­men­tary Helps Us Learn from the Painful Lessons of the 20th Cen­tu­ry\nHan­nah Arendt on “Per­son­al Respon­si­bil­i­ty Under Dic­ta­tor­ship:” Bet­ter to Suf­fer Than Col­lab­o­rate\n\t\t",

Traveling to the Okinawa prefecture in the hopes of encountering a scarcely documented species of larval goosefish, Kovacs spent nearly two weeks blackwater diving before photographing the rare moment. \n“Unfortunately, this beautiful little fish turned out to be incredibly uncooperative and difficult to photograph,” Kovacs says. “After spending some time with it, I was very fortunate that, for one brief moment, it decided to yawn while facing the camera.” The resulting image is aptly titled “Tired fish.”\nSteven Kovacs, “Tired Fish,” Kumejima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan\nThis past year, the annual contest saw thousands of entries spanning more than 90 countries. From silky sharks in Cuba to small pipefish in Indonesia, each photograph highlights unique, fleeting underwater moments that often go unseen.

    "body": "\n\tThe art dealer Marian Goodman, who was revered for her enduring commitment to the artists that she represented, and for her disinclination to follow either aesthetic or business trends, died on Thursday in a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 97. The New York Times first reported news of her death on Sunday.\n\n\tIn 1977, at the age of 49, Goodman opened her eponymous gallery in Midtown Manhattan with a show of the late Belgian artist and poet Marcel Broodthaers, whose conceptually rigorous work was indicative of her venturesome taste. Over the proceeding five decades, she exhibited, and helped establish, many of the leading artists of her time, especially Europeans who had not yet received their full due in the United States.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tOnce Goodman decided to take on an artist, she was all-in. “One must be willing to keep showing an artist for fifteen or twenty years,” she told the art critic Peter Schjeldahl in the New Yorker in 2004. (She gave interviews sparingly, preferring to have the press focus on her artists.) Mainstays of her roster included painter Gerhard Richter and installation artist Lothar Baumgarten, both from Germany, the Italian Arte Povera masters Giovanni Anselmo and Giuseppe Penone, British director Steve McQueen, Ethiopian American painter Julie Mehretu, South African draughtsman-filmmaker William Kentridge, and many other celebrated names.\n\n\t“If you’d only bought work from Marian Goodman over the last 40 years, you would have one of the best museums in the world today,” Tom Eccles, the director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, said in a WSJ Magazine profile of her in 2014.\n\n\tMarian Geller was born in 1928 in New York, where she lived almost her entire life. Her father, Maurice Geller, was an accountant and fervent art fan who amassed 40 paintings by the American modernist Milton Avery. The future gallerist attended Emerson College in Boston, where she mulled a career in journalism, and at the start of her 20s, married William Goodman, a civil engineer. They divorced in 1968.\n\n\tThere is no set track to becoming an art dealer, but Goodman’s approach was particularly unusual. In 1962, she put together a set of prints as a fundraiser for the New York school of her two children, Michael and Amy, who survive her. “I thought, Maybe I could do this for a living,” she said in the New Yorker.  \n\t\n\n\tThe next year, Goodman started graduate art-history classes at Columbia University, and in 1965 she launched a company called Multiples to publish and sell affordable editions by artists. (She had first brought the idea to the Museum of Modern Art, which rejected it.) The concept was “close to the socialist idea that art should be accessible,” she told Blake Gopnik in the New York Times in 2021. Her capital came from business partners and the sale of an Avery painting that her father had given her, and the firm went on to release material by major artists like Larry Rivers, Claes Oldenburg, and Roy Lichtenstein.\n\n\tRegular trips that Goodman made to Europe were pivotal in honing her art interests, and she finally took the step of creating her own gallery after being unable to find a New York dealer for Broodthaers. She chose 57th Street for her operation, then a hub of the city’s art world, but as her peers flocked to SoHo and then Chelsea in the coming years, she stayed. “I saw dealers running after artists, then throwing them out and going on to the next,” she said of the SoHo scene in the New Yorker. “I was afraid it was contagious.”\n\n\tIn 1985, the gallery moved into its longtime home, on the fourth floor of a building on 57th. Because of its modestly sized elevators, larger artworks had to be brought in through a window, gingerly, via a crane. The somewhat unorthodox location, and the sterling reputation behind it, made each exhibition there a kind of special event.\n\t\n\n\tAs the art market roared in the 1990s and 2000s, some ambitious dealers began dotting the globe with branches. Goodman did not. She opened a Paris space in 1995 (her current, intimate venue there dates to 1999), and in 2014 inaugurated a sprawling one in London, which shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. (“Brexit has changed London’s role,” she told ARTnews at the time.)\n\n\tGoodman’s singular approach suited her artists; like her, they tended to be steeped in art history and serious-minded (true even of the hijinks-prone Maurizio Cattelan, whom she long showed). They were all hands-on in their practices, and they were all in it for the long haul. Many of the gallery’s artists were, or came to be, in high demand from deep-pocketed collectors, but their dealer was famous for steering their work into permanent collections.\n\n\tEven as she kept a certain distance (physically and psychically) from the ever-expanding art industry, Goodman won the admiration of her competitors. David Zwirner told WSJ that, when he was starting his gallery in the 1990s, she was “a model that I aspired to.” Jeffrey Deitch told the New York Times in 2021, “She defined the model of the contemporary gallery as having the same standards of a great museum.” (When Schjeldahl had asked her to guess how art-world denizens viewed her, her answer was: “Responsible. A passionate advocate for my artists. Batting average pretty good. More wise than unwise.”)\n\t\n\n\tAs Goodman entered her 90s, she put a partnership team into place, comprising Rose Lord, Junette Teng, Emily-Jane Kirwan, and Leslie Nolen, planning for the gallery’s future. Then in 2019, she hired Philipp Kaiser, once the director of the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, as president ; he remained until April. With the passing years, Goodman was seen less often, and there were signs of change. In 2023, the gallery said that it would decamp from Midtown for Tribeca, where many other blue-chip enterprises have moved in the past half-decade. That same year, it opened in Los Angeles, another hothouse of commercial activity.\n\n\tRichter, who had more than a solo dozen shows with Goodman between 1985 and 2020, departed in late 2022 for Zwirner. “Marian is a presence,” he had told the New Yorker some two decades earlier. “She is wise. She has courage.”\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe Minneapolis Institute of Art, the city’s leading art museum, announced on Sunday that it would remain closed on Sunday “for the safety of staff and visitors,” according to a statement posted to Instagram.\n\n\tThe institution was one of many in the city to close on Friday as part of the Day of Truth and Freedom, a statewide protest organized in response to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Minnesota communities in recent weeks.\n\n\tOn Saturday, during an ICE operation, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, in Minneapolis. After the shooting, federal officials said that agents acted in self-defense, claiming that Pretti “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun,” according to Security of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. She further said that officers “attempted to disarm” Pretti and that he “violently resisted.”\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tBut the killing inflamed tensions in the city after multiple eyewitness videos posted to social media ran counter to the Trump administration’s narrative. In the videos, Pretti is seen coming to the aid of a person pushed by federal agents. Over half dozen agents take Pretti down before shots are fired. In at least one of the videos, a federal agent appears to remove a gun from Pretti before he is shot.\n\n\tThe shooting, which occurred at Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street, is only a few blocks from the MIA. The institution was open Saturday, but it closed early after news of the shooting broke. A statement posted to Instagram reads, “Due to unfolding events in the local area, the museum will be closing early today … The safety of our visitors, staff, and community is our primary concern.”\n\n\tWhile other institutions did not make similar announcements, the NBA postponed Saturday’s game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors in response, saying that it did so “to prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community.” It did say, however, that the game would be played Sunday evening.\n",

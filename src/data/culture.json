    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tDecember 5th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt would be impos­si­ble to under­stand West­ern civ­i­liza­tion with­out under­stand­ing the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ty. But in order to do that, it may serve us well to think of it as the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ties, plur­al. So sug­gests Hochela­ga cre­ator Tom­mie Trelawny in the new video above, which explains the Gnos­tic Gospels, the “for­bid­den teach­ings of Jesus.” As a sys­tem of beliefs, Gnos­ti­cism is a fair­ly far cry from the main­stream forms of Chris­tian­i­ty with which most of us are famil­iar today. But its sur­viv­ing texts may sound uncan­ni­ly famil­iar, despite also involv­ing out­landish-sound­ing ele­ments that seem to belong to anoth­er civ­i­liza­tion entire­ly. Gnos­tic teach­ings have long been con­sid­ered heresy by Chris­tians, but do they real­ly rep­re­sent just a dif­fer­ent evo­lu­tion­ary branch of the faith: anoth­er Chris­tian­i­ty?\nReli­gious schol­ars of many stripes have con­cerned them­selves with few mat­ters as inten­sive­ly as they have with theod­i­cy, that is, the mat­ter of how to square the notion of a good, omnipo­tent deity with the obvi­ous exis­tence of evil down here in the world. Since its loose coali­tion of beliefs came togeth­er in the late first cen­tu­ry, Gnos­ti­cism has pro­posed an ele­gant solu­tion: that the deity is not, in fact, good, or rather, that under the tran­scen­dent, unknow­able God is a much more poor­ly behaved “demi­urge” who dis­plays an indif­fer­ence, at best, to the lot of human­i­ty. In this view, our result­ing world is less a per­fect cre­ation than a cos­mic mis­take — a propo­si­tion that would account for cer­tain of its qual­i­ties we expe­ri­ence on the day-to-day lev­el, even if we have no par­tic­u­lar reli­gious pro­cliv­i­ties.\nThanks to the dis­cov­ery of Egyp­t’s Nag Ham­ma­di library in 1945, we can direct­ly access many of the teach­ings of the so-called “Gnos­tic Gospels.” They tell us, to make a few grand sim­pli­fi­ca­tions, that our real­i­ty is illu­so­ry and that we can only come to grasp the true nature of both it and our­selves through eso­teric learn­ing, gno­sis being the ancient Greek term for knowl­edge. This world­view may bring to mind that of cer­tain Greek philoso­phers, or indeed that of The Matrix, a near-oblig­a­tory ref­er­ence for a video like this. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry on from that movie, it’s not hard to under­stand why it res­onat­ed with the siz­able-enough pro­por­tion of human­i­ty who feel alien­at­ed from who they real­ly are or what the world real­ly is — and who, any mil­len­ni­um now, would make rea­son­ably promis­ing can­di­dates to bring about a Gnos­tic revival.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n3,500 Occult Man­u­scripts Will Be Dig­i­tized & Made Freely Avail­able Online, Thanks to The Da Vin­ci Code Author Dan Brown\nBehold the Codex Gigas (aka “Devil’s Bible”), the Largest Medieval Man­u­script in the World\nThe Phi­los­o­phy of The Matrix: From Pla­to and Descartes, to East­ern Phi­los­o­phy\nThe Ancient Greeks Who Con­vert­ed to Bud­dhism\nDis­cov­er Thomas Jefferson’s Cut-and-Paste Ver­sion of the Bible, and Read the Curi­ous Edi­tion Online\nHow Our Depic­tion of Jesus Changed Over 2,000 Years and What He May Have Actu­al­ly Looked Like\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLocated in the Yangtze River Delta, Hangzhou is enmeshed in waterways. The city’s center abuts a large lake and sits just north of the Qiantang River, infamous for its magnificent tidal bore that sweeps through the region each fall.\nFor their latest project presented in the Hangzhou Triennial of Fiber Art at Zhejiang Art Museum, Jin Choi and Thomas Shine merged aspects of this local environment and culture with their distinctive process. The artists, who work as Choi + Shine Architects, often create sweeping lace isntallations crocheted in partnership with local communities. Choi typically designs the motif, while Shine focuses on the structure itself. \n\nSuspended above reflective surface mimicking a dark body of water, “Distance” comprises crocheted sculptures representing all 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac. “As society evolves, [the zodiac] continues to find relevance, connecting to the wisdom of the past and the shared narratives that shape our identities today,” the artists write. “Its legacy, with its rich symbolism, cultural significance and unifying power, will endure as a navigational tool in the current and future social shifts.”\nRather than depict a dog or rabbit in its entirety, Choi isolated elements of each animal—find preliminary sketches and reference imagery on the artists’ website. The ox, for example, is represented through a slender tube evocative of a horn, while the rooster can be spotted through a fan-like plume. \nThe installation’s structure is circular and appears to shift depending on the viewer’s perpseicve. “The composition loses its legible visual order and the elements start to form different relations, allowing for varying compositions,” the artists say. This emphasizes “one’s power to position oneself in reference to others, to actively define different connections and relationships.”\nAs for the making-of, Choi + Shine know that community members come to their collaborative process with varying levels of craft experience. Their projects often become educational sessions in addition to community gatherings, as participants demonstrate a particular stitch or help troubleshoot issues. \n\n“Many volunteers are actually novices in crochet, and there are many complex patterns. They may not be very good at crochet, so we are in the process of communicating and collaborating. Beginners and skilled volunteers help each other,” said Wu Qin, who led volunteer efforts for this isntallation.\n“Distance” is now permanently isntalled at the Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne of the top comments on a new video from the Victoria and Albert Museum reads as follows: “I think it is time to have a renaissance of mourning. In this age of sanitized and hidden grief, it would be a welcomed relief for a more refined mourning experience.”\nThis commenter is responding to two V&A curators unboxing a collection of 19th-century objects common in Victorian mourning traditions. Through a variety of garments, ephemera, and photos, the pair showcases the elaborate rituals and rites people once used to honor the dead.\n\n\n\nThe video highlights a black, silk gown with tiny pleats, delicate lace, and sequins, along with jewelry made from semi-precious jet stones, and brooches containing human hair. The curators also present several printed artifacts, like mourning cards and portraits of the dying.\nWhat becomes clear throughout the video is how much our contemporary culture of grief and loss has turned inward and is something managed privately rather than shared with a community. “Mourning objects can be personal, portable, ostentatious, sentimental, or even a little bit grizzly,” the curators add. “Is it too much? Or do you think we should mourn the passing of these poignant and fascinating trappings of grief?”\nFind the unboxing on YouTube, along with several additional adventures in the museum’s collections.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Her most recent paintings, created during the past three years, reflect Blitt’s deepening connection with the natural world around her, building on core themes within her practice while reaching new levels of intimacy and nuance. Central to her approach is the conviction that line possesses an animating energy — each brushstroke, drawn gesture, or fusion of color embodies a sense of momentum and fluidity, as if capturing the choreography of nature itself.Throughout the decades, Blitt has consistently drawn inspiration from nature, family, music, and movement, aiming to transform the everyday beauty of neighborhood gardens and trees into expansive contemplations on growth, renewal, and the cyclical nature of life. Through painting, she turns fleeting glimpses of the everyday into meditations on the universal, hoping to remind viewers of nature’s endless potential for artistic transformation. Blitt’s signature style, where movement and color form a contrapuntal interdependence, intends for the local to become universal and the transient to become enduring.“Thinking of Trees IV” (2025) encapsulates these ideas. In this painting, Blitt’s commitment as a colorist is evident: radiant hues envelop energetic lines, echoing her landscapes of the 1960s and the luminous “Ovals” of the 1980s. “Thinking of Trees IV” demonstrates how she infuses color to create atmosphere, layering tones to evoke the shifting light and changing seasons. Sinuous lines suggest tree branches swaying in the breeze, their energy extending beyond the canvas. A visual symphony, harmonies of line and color resonate with the emotional and sensory registers of the natural world, reaffirming Blitt’s effort to translate the essence of nature into vibrant visual music.Find more information on the exhibition at leedy-voulkos.com, and learn about the artist at ritablitt.com.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnouncement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSponsored\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExhibition Announcement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMissouri\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

As part of a three-year investigation that will inform upcoming restoration work, archaeologists discovered 60 flint flakes they believe were used as tools around 4,300 BCE during the Mesolithic or early Neolithic period. The archaeologists also uncovered additional items, including 800-year-old footwear and a 19th-century beer jug. The group noted that the flint artifacts predate Stonehenge's earliest earthworks by 1,000 years. At Stonehenge, flint tools are believed to have been used to chip and shape stone. The flint artifacts, said the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority in a press release, originated from the now-gone Thorney Island, formed by the once intersecting Thames and River Tyburn. Prehistoric people, archaeologists said, used that island stretch for fishing, hunting, and food gathering. The objects were discovered in the Cromwell Green section of the property.Flint artifacts believed to be 6,000 years old (image courtesy Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority)The discovery comes as parliament weighs costly options for the much-needed restoration of the building. Parliament was expected to vote on a final plan for the restoration of the palace later this year, but the process appears to be delayed again as members contend with a multibillion-pound price tag on the renewal. Proponents for urgent restoration caution against increasing fire risk to the building as it ages. Over the last decade, there were a reported 44 fires in the building. Judith Cummins MP, Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority board chair, said in a statement that the discovery came as part of inquiries into the building's history as it prepares for a major renovation \"to understand more about the building and the thousands of years of history underneath the home of Parliament.\" Nine areas of the Westminster campus are subject to the investigations, including the Royal Court, Speaker’s Court, and the Thames River shoreline. The discovery comes ahead of an expected restoration of the historic palace.\"It is vital we continue these investigations to understand what lies beneath the ground here at an early stage to inform and guide decisions on design and further surveys ahead of future enabling and construction works,\" Diane Abrams, the lead archaeologist for the investigations, said in a statement. \"This ensures the site’s extraordinary heritage and archaeology is managed appropriately while enabling the safe and efficient delivery of the Restoration and Renewal Programme.”Earlier this year, archaeologists at the site uncovered part of a medieval two-story hall from 1167, believed to have burnt completely in the 19th century, which once served as a dining area and as the Court of Chancery, the Court of Requests, and for parliamentary functions. In a statement, the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority said this previous discovery had been the most important of the group's work to date.The investigations will carry on through 2026, and a final report on the group's findings will be released in 2027.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

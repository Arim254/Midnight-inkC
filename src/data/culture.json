    "body": "\n\tin Creativity, Music |   \tJanuary 27th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIf you’ve heard Run‑D.M.C.‘s Rais­ing Hell, Rage Against the Machine’s self-titled debut, John­ny Cash’s Amer­i­can Record­ings, or Adele’s 21, you’ve heard the work of Rick Rubin. Yet even if you’ve lis­tened close­ly to every song on which he’s been cred­it­ed as a pro­duc­er over the past 45 years, you may have trou­ble pin­ning down what, exact­ly, the work of Rick Rubin is. Though his résumé includes such pro­fes­sion­al achieve­ments as co-found­ing both Def Jam Record­ings and Amer­i­can Record­ings, as well as shar­ing the pres­i­den­cy of Colum­bia Records for a stretch, he’s become best known in recent years as a kind of bare­foot sage of cre­ativ­i­ty.\n\n\n\t\n\nRubin has proven ready to dis­pense some­times-cryp­tic wis­dom in what­ev­er con­texts he finds him­self, and in the twen­ty-twen­ties, that role nat­u­ral­ly involves appear­ing on a lot of long-form inter­view pod­casts.\nFor Rubin in par­tic­u­lar, the pub­li­ca­tion of his book The Cre­ative Act: A Way of Being con­sti­tut­ed an incen­tive — or per­haps an excuse — to take a seat across from pop­u­lar pod­cast­ers like Lex Frid­man, Jay Shet­ty, and Andrew Huber­man. Nat­u­ral­ly, these con­ver­sa­tions spend a good deal of time on ques­tions of what it takes to cre­ate a work of art, great or oth­er­wise, in music or whichev­er medi­um it may be.\n\n\n\t\n\nOne of the most sur­pris­ing points to which Rubin returns again and again is that the best art is nev­er made to please an audi­ence. Instead of try­ing to antic­i­pate the tastes of oth­ers, you must first sat­is­fy your­self with your work. Think back to your first encounter with your very favorite albums, films, or books, and you’ll real­ize the truth of Rubin’s words. Even then, it must have felt like the musi­cian, the direc­tor, or the author did­n’t guess what you want­ed, but worked to cre­ate some­thing per­son­al­ly res­o­nant that went on to res­onate with you — and, per­haps, mil­lions of oth­ers as well.\n\n\n\t\n\nThe fac­tors involved in such an artis­tic con­nec­tion are many and inscrutable, in Rubin’s telling, and attempts at their expla­na­tion tend to verge on the mys­ti­cal. But they can’t be reduced to a for­mu­la that applies always and every­where, which means that cre­ators of all kinds have to go through expe­ri­ence after long expe­ri­ence of tri­al and error through­out their careers. For many, this can neces­si­tate get­ting a day job, Rubin’s advo­ca­cy of which puts him at odds with anoth­er of the most famous music producer/gurus of all time. But then, there’s more than one way to get cre­ative in this world.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nRick Rubin: The Invis­i­bil­i­ty of Hip Hop’s Great­est Pro­duc­er\nThe Beast­ie Boys & Rick Rubin Reunite and Revis­it Their For­ma­tive Time Togeth­er in 1980s NYC\nRick Rubin Revis­its the Ori­gins of Def Jam Records & the NYU Dorm Room Where It All Began\nMal­colm Glad­well and Rick Rubin Launch a New Music Pod­cast, Bro­ken Record: Lis­ten Online\nFamed New Orleans Music Pro­duc­er Mark Bing­ham Dis­cuss­es His Songs and Col­lab­o­ra­tions: A Naked­ly Exam­ined Music Con­ver­sa­tion (#136)\nThe Long Game of Cre­ativ­i­ty: If You Haven’t Cre­at­ed a Mas­ter­piece at 30, You’re Not a Fail­ure\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Archaeology, Art, History |   \tJanuary 26th, 2026  2 Comments\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImage by Ahdi Agus Okta­viana\nOver the cen­turies, a vari­ety of places have laid cred­i­ble claim to being the world’s art cen­ter: Con­stan­tino­ple, Flo­rence, Paris, New York. But on the scale of, say, ten mil­len­nia, the hot spots become rather less rec­og­niz­able. Up until about 20,000 years ago, it seems that cre­ators and view­ers of art alike spent a good deal in one par­tic­u­lar cave: Liang Metan­duno, locat­ed on Muna Island in Indone­si­a’s South­east Sulawe­si province. The many paint­ings on its walls of rec­og­niz­able humans, ani­mals, and boats have brought it fame in our times as a kind of ancient art gallery. But in recent years, a much old­er piece of work has been dis­cov­ered there, one whose cre­ation occurred at least 67,800 years ago.\nThe cre­ation in ques­tion is a hand­print, faint but detectable, prob­a­bly made by blow­ing a mix­ture of ochre and water over an actu­al human hand. To deter­mine its age, researchers per­formed what’s called ura­ni­um-series analy­sis on the deposits of cal­ci­um car­bon­ate that had built up on and around it.\nThe num­ber of 67,800 years is, of course, not exact, but it’s also just a min­i­mum: in fact, the hand­print could well be much old­er. In a paper pub­lished last week in Nature, the researchers point out that its age exceeds both that of the old­est sim­i­lar rock art found else­where in Indone­sia and that of a hand sten­cil in Spain attrib­uted to Nean­derthals, “which until now rep­re­sent­ed the old­est demon­strat­ed min­i­mum-age con­straint for cave art world­wide.”\nIt isn’t impos­si­ble that this at least 67,800-year-old hand­print could also have been made by Nean­derthals. The obvi­ous mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the hand’s shape, how­ev­er, an exten­sion and taper­ing of the fin­gers that brings to mind ani­mal claws (or the clutch­es of Nos­fer­atu), sug­gests to cer­tain sci­en­tif­ic eyes the kind of cog­ni­tion attrib­ut­able specif­i­cal­ly to Homo sapi­ens. This dis­cov­ery has great poten­tial rel­e­vance not just to art his­to­ry, but even more so to oth­er fields con­cerned with the devel­op­ment of our species. While it had pre­vi­ous­ly been thought, for instance, that the first human set­tlers of Aus­tralia made their way there through Indone­sia (in a time of much low­er sea lev­els) between 50,000 and 65,000 years ago, the hand­print­’s exis­tence in Liang Metan­duno sug­gests that the migra­tion took place even ear­li­er. All these mil­len­nia lat­er, Aus­tralia remains a favored des­ti­na­tion for a vari­ety of immi­grants — some of whom do their part to keep Syd­ney’s art scene inter­est­ing.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAlger­ian Cave Paint­ings Sug­gest Humans Did Mag­ic Mush­rooms 9,000 Years Ago\nWas a 32,000-Year-Old Cave Paint­ing the Ear­li­est Form of Cin­e­ma?\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er the World’s First “Art Stu­dio” Cre­at­ed in an Ethiopi­an Cave 43,000 Years Ago\nA Recent­ly Dis­cov­ered 44,000-Year-Old Cave Paint­ing Tells the Old­est Known Sto­ry\n40,000-Year-Old Sym­bols Found in Caves World­wide May Be the Ear­li­est Writ­ten Lan­guage\nArchae­ol­o­gists Dis­cov­er 200,000-Year-Old Hand & Foot­prints That Could Be the World’s Ear­li­est Cave Art\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\nImage by Bernd Schwabe, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\nAt least when I was in grade school, we learned the very basics of how the Third Reich came to pow­er in the ear­ly 1930s. Para­mil­i­tary gangs ter­ror­iz­ing the oppo­si­tion, the incom­pe­tence and oppor­tunism of Ger­man con­ser­v­a­tives, the Reich­stag Fire. And we learned about the crit­i­cal impor­tance of pro­pa­gan­da, the delib­er­ate mis­in­form­ing of the pub­lic in order to sway opin­ions en masse and achieve pop­u­lar sup­port (or at least the appear­ance of it). While Min­is­ter of Pro­pa­gan­da Joseph Goebbels purged Jew­ish and left­ist artists and writ­ers, he built a mas­sive media infra­struc­ture that played, writes PBS, “prob­a­bly the most impor­tant role in cre­at­ing an atmos­phere in Ger­many that made it pos­si­ble for the Nazis to com­mit ter­ri­ble atroc­i­ties against Jews, homo­sex­u­als, and oth­er minori­ties.”\nHow did the minor­i­ty par­ty of Hitler and Goebbels take over and break the will of the Ger­man peo­ple so thor­ough­ly that they would allow and par­tic­i­pate in mass mur­der? Post-war schol­ars of total­i­tar­i­an­ism like Theodor Adorno and Han­nah Arendt asked that ques­tion over and over, for sev­er­al decades after­ward. Their ear­li­est stud­ies on the sub­ject looked at two sides of the equa­tion. Adorno con­tributed to a mas­sive vol­ume of social psy­chol­o­gy called The Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty, which stud­ied indi­vid­u­als pre­dis­posed to the appeals of total­i­tar­i­an­ism. He invent­ed what he called the F‑Scale (“F” for “fas­cism”), one of sev­er­al mea­sures he used to the­o­rize the Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Type.\nArendt, on the oth­er hand, looked close­ly at the regimes of Hitler and Stal­in and their func­tionar­ies, at the ide­ol­o­gy of sci­en­tif­ic racism, and at the mech­a­nism of pro­pa­gan­da in fos­ter­ing “a curi­ous­ly vary­ing mix­ture of gulli­bil­i­ty and cyn­i­cism with which each mem­ber… is expect­ed to react to the chang­ing lying state­ments of the lead­ers.” So she wrote in her 1951 Ori­gins of Total­i­tar­i­an­ism, going on to elab­o­rate that this “mix­ture of gulli­bil­i­ty and cyn­i­cism… is preva­lent in all ranks of total­i­tar­i­an move­ments”:\nIn an ever-chang­ing, incom­pre­hen­si­ble world the mass­es had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe every­thing and noth­ing, think that every­thing was pos­si­ble and noth­ing was true… The total­i­tar­i­an mass lead­ers based their pro­pa­gan­da on the cor­rect psy­cho­log­i­cal assump­tion that, under such con­di­tions, one could make peo­ple believe the most fan­tas­tic state­ments one day, and trust that if the next day they were giv­en irrefutable proof of their false­hood, they would take refuge in cyn­i­cism; instead of desert­ing the lead­ers who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the state­ment was a lie and would admire the lead­ers for their supe­ri­or tac­ti­cal clev­er­ness.\nWhy the con­stant, often bla­tant lying? For one thing, it func­tioned as a means of ful­ly dom­i­nat­ing sub­or­di­nates, who would have to cast aside all their integri­ty to repeat out­ra­geous false­hoods and would then be bound to the leader by shame and com­plic­i­ty. “The great ana­lysts of truth and lan­guage in pol­i­tics”—writes McGill Uni­ver­si­ty polit­i­cal phi­los­o­phy pro­fes­sor Jacob T. Levy—includ­ing “George Orwell, Han­nah Arendt, Vaclav Havel—can help us rec­og­nize this kind of lie for what it is.… Say­ing some­thing obvi­ous­ly untrue, and mak­ing your sub­or­di­nates repeat it with a straight face in their own voice, is a par­tic­u­lar­ly star­tling dis­play of pow­er over them. It’s some­thing that was endem­ic to total­i­tar­i­an­ism.”\nArendt and oth­ers rec­og­nized, writes Levy, that “being made to repeat an obvi­ous lie makes it clear that you’re pow­er­less.” She also rec­og­nized the func­tion of an avalanche of lies to ren­der a pop­u­lace pow­er­less to resist, the phe­nom­e­non we now refer to as “gaslight­ing”:\nThe result of a con­sis­tent and total sub­sti­tu­tion of lies for fac­tu­al truth is not that the lie will now be accept­ed as truth and truth be defamed as a lie, but that the sense by which we take our bear­ings in the real world—and the cat­e­go­ry of truth ver­sus false­hood is among the men­tal means to this end—is being destroyed. \nThe epis­te­mo­log­i­cal ground thus pulled out from under them, most would depend on what­ev­er the leader said, no mat­ter its rela­tion to truth. “The essen­tial con­vic­tion shared by all ranks,” Arendt con­clud­ed, “from fel­low trav­el­er to leader, is that pol­i­tics is a game of cheat­ing and that the ‘first com­mand­ment’ of the move­ment: ‘The Fuehrer is always right,’ is as nec­es­sary for the pur­pos­es of world pol­i­tics, i.e., world-wide cheat­ing, as the rules of mil­i­tary dis­ci­pline are for the pur­pos­es of war.”\nArendt wrote Ori­gins of Total­i­tar­i­an­ism from research and obser­va­tions gath­ered dur­ing the 1940s, a very spe­cif­ic his­tor­i­cal peri­od. Nonethe­less the book, Jef­frey Isaacs remarks at The Wash­ing­ton Post, “rais­es a set of fun­da­men­tal ques­tions about how tyran­ny can arise and the dan­ger­ous forms of inhu­man­i­ty to which it can lead.” Arendt’s analy­sis of pro­pa­gan­da and the func­tion of lies seems par­tic­u­lar­ly rel­e­vant at this moment. The kinds of bla­tant lies she wrote of might become so com­mon­place as to become banal. We might begin to think they are an irrel­e­vant sideshow. This, she sug­gests, would be a mis­take.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nAre You a Fas­cist?: Take Theodor Adorno’s Author­i­tar­i­an Per­son­al­i­ty Test Cre­at­ed to Com­bat Fas­cism (1947)\nUmber­to Eco’s List of the 14 Com­mon Fea­tures of Fas­cism\nThe Sto­ry of Fas­cism: Rick Steves’ Doc­u­men­tary Helps Us Learn from the Painful Lessons of the 20th Cen­tu­ry\nHan­nah Arendt on “Per­son­al Respon­si­bil­i­ty Under Dic­ta­tor­ship:” Bet­ter to Suf­fer Than Col­lab­o­rate\n\t\t",

Ergo, it’s time for an “eco­nom­ic strike,” a “short-term coor­di­nat­ed with­draw­al from spend­ing.” He con­tin­ues: “if wealthy house­holds took their spend­ing down 10% and mid­dle class and low­er income house­holds … took it down 5%, you would take GDP neg­a­tive almost overnight.”\nBut he also gets more spe­cif­ic than that:  “If you want­ed the fastest blue line path … I believe if you could con­vince Amer­i­ca, the entire econ­o­my now is built on AI… if you could con­vince a bunch of Amer­i­cans to can­cel their Chat­G­PT or Ope­nAI accounts and all of a sud­den Ope­nAI had to announce that their sub­scrip­tions had fall­en off a cliff, that would rip­ple into Nvidia. That would rip­ple into Microsoft. And these are the peo­ple that Trump cares about.”\nHe goes on to add: “If you could fig­ure out a way to basi­cal­ly kick a small num­ber of com­pa­nies relat­ed to the tech econ­o­my that account for 40% of the S&P right now … if all of a sud­den, if you took all of your mon­ey out of any JP Mor­gan–affil­i­at­ed bank and trans­ferred it to a local region­al bank, if you can­celled all of your stream­ing media plat­forms, if you can­celled Ope­nAI and Anthrop­ic and you said “I am not upgrad­ing my Apple phone,” and there was a real move­ment that reg­is­tered and they had to dis­close it in their earn­ings calls — this would come to an end pron­to.” CEOs would stop bend­ing their knees and sud­den­ly find their voice.\nEvery dol­lar we spend—or withhold—sends a sig­nal to the mar­ket and to Trump. When enough peo­ple hold back, the pow­er of the purse can do what courts and elect­ed offi­cials can­not. Trump reversed many tar­iffs after mar­kets freaked out on ‘Lib­er­a­tion Day.’ What’s to say it wouldn’t work again?\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nFor three months, Julia Fernandez would spend the hours between 8 a.m. and noon waiting for the right light to filter into her Brooklyn studio. Once the shared space was properly lit, she would swap out a grid of 12 ceramic tiles and take overhead photos that would eventually be pieced together into the charming stop-motion animation, “Dirt.”\nThe music video for an acoustic song by Los Angeles-based Emory, Fernandez’s film cycles through 300 tiles that reveal a small rabbit hopping across the frame, children running, and a spindly, line-drawn flower blooming and wilting. Each carved character is set within the grainy patchwork, which highlights the medium’s particularities through irregular edges and differences in the glazes. Combined with the physical manipulations required of stop-motion, the ceramic animation is a poetic ode to an unlikely pairing of tactile media.\n\n\n\nIn a conversation with It’s Nice That, Fernandez shares that she first melded the two after etching a small cup that doubled as a zoetrope. Also featuring a rabbit and a flower, this playful compilation is a clear precursor to the techniques and characters that shine in “Dirt.” “Seeing a material that’s supposed to be still and permanent begin to move felt like magic, like I had cracked some code in reality to create movement that should otherwise be impossible,” she said.\nWatch more of the artist’s ceramic animations on Instagram.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nStarting with the inherently gridded layouts of LEGO baseplates,  Katherine Duclos creates vibrant, undulating compositions of pastels and gradients. The Vancouver-based artist employs the colorful bricks in a variety of geometric patterns and low-relief textures to achieve dynamic compositions that appear almost kinetic, adding her own effects with paint. The impression of movement, paired with the tactility of the toy pieces, transforms a familiar object we typically associate with childlike play into a elegant assemblages cradled in wood panels.\nA large-scale, participatory exhibition of new work by Duclos, including a couple of LEGO pieces, marks the first presentation of the new ACT Arts Centre in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. The compositions you see here go on view in Grid Memories at Heron Arts in San Francisco alongside works by Alexis Arnold, Gina Borg, and Kim Bennett, running from January 31 to March 5. And she’s currently working toward another interactive show slated for June in Sweden, during which visitors will be able to interact with Duclos’ LEGO pieces.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDetroit Institute of Arts Workers United (DIAWU) standing in solidarity outside of the DIA on Tuesday, November 4, 2025. (photo courtesy DIAWU and AFSCME)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nDozens of employees at the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) have gone public with their cross-departmental push to unionize through AFSCME Cultural Workers United this week, hopping on the years-long wave of arts and culture institution workforces organizing nationwide. Under the title DIA Workers United, the group presented the museum with a letter requesting recognition of its union on Tuesday, November 4.\nA spokesperson for AFSCME Michigan told Hyperallergic that they’re “working towards voluntary recognition, and the relationship with the museum has been very positive,” also noting that DIA Workers United represents a “strong majority that is growing every single day.” \nSarah Burger, one of the organizers for DIA Workers United who has worked at the museum as a preparator for 20 years now, told Hyperallergic over the phone that serious conversations about unionizing started towards the end of 2024, and now  “almost every single department within the museum is being represented at this point.”\n Burger explained that like many other cultural worker unions, DIA Workers United comes together out of love for the museum and the work being done within it, telling Hyperallergic that staff are “passionate about their work, but they just wanna make ends meet.”\n“ I personally have been priced out of two neighborhoods,” Burger stated. She said she’s lived in Detroit for 25 years, and that the city is in the midst of a major development and revitalization effort that has already led to rising rents and housing costs. \nThe worker also lauded the DIA’s board and administration for the museum’s growing endowment, as well as the stable operations budget secured through the Tri-County millage (in which 0.2% property taxes from Macomb, Wayne, and Oakland counties go toward funding the museum) in 2012 and again 2021, but noted that “in a financially secure institution, there’s no reason that that full-time employees should be working a second job.”\n“ I do think that people at the ‘top’ ought to be compensated well for those efforts, but the people at the ‘bottom’ are also very important and all deserve to be getting a living wage,” Burger continued. She pointed out that the lowest wage at the museum is $16.50 an hour; the museum is currently advertising roles in visitor experience, security, and retail sales at this rate. \nDIA has not yet replied to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment. \nBurger also alleged that DIA has left certain positions vacant for over a year, and had employees in subordinate roles assume the responsibilities of said positions without providing them with title changes, promotions, or increases in compensation. \n“We don’t want this to be an ‘us versus them’ situation,” Burger said of DIA Workers United’s relationship with the museum, alluding to how the Los Angeles County Museum of Art recently declined to recognize its staff’s union this week. \n“ We want to work with [the museum], we want to negotiate. I think we’ll be able to strike a balance with the administration and truly have a partnership,” Burger explained. “I think that’s exciting, because if your employees are thriving, then the museum is really going to be thriving.”\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRhea Nayyar (she/her) is a New York City-based staff reporter at Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\nJean Auguste Dominique Ingres’ “The Princesse de Broglie” at the Met Museum in New York may have been damaged by a rogue visitor. (1825–1860 (courtesy the Metropolitan Museum of Art)\nOn Halloween, while dressed as Dakota Johnson from her Architectural Digest home tour, I was approached by a blond man in all black clothing, a safety vest, and a tiara who needed directions.\n“Louvre thief!” I shouted at him. “I thought you were arrested.” Drunk twenty-somethings in safety vests buzzed around us in the East Village, as if they’d answered some sort of casting call. It was official: the Louvre thief was 2025’s NPC (Non-Playable Character for those unfamiliar with Gen-Z English) costume of the year.\nThis major art heist extended its reach far beyond the art world and into the cultural vernacular as a low-budget costume option. While the Louvre break-in might be the most ubiquitous art-involved criminal behavior in the news right now, there are a few other thefts and petty vandalisms that Hyperallergic is keeping tabs on, including an incident at the Metropolitan Museum of Art this week and a 1,000-item heist in Oakland, California. I have the latest for you.\n\nA Social Media Star among the Louvre suspects?\nParisian media reported that one of the four Louvre heist suspects in custody was a local social media “star” and motorbike enthusiast named Abdouldaye N, who goes by the alias “Doudou Cross Bitume” online and was once a security guard at the Centre Pompidou. “Star” might be a generous label, however, as accounts on YouTube and Instagram matching the name and description have less than 1,000 followers combined. If that’s the case, I guess you can call me a social media star too.\nThe Guardian observed that in several of Mr. Bitume’s uploads, he is “shown riding a Yamaha TMax, the particularly powerful make of mega-scooter used in the Louvre thieves’ getaway.” Equally ridiculous is the revelation that the password to the museum’s security system was, wait for it, “Louvre,” according to reports.\nThe Galerie d’Apollon at the Louvre Museum (photo by Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images)\nA splash at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEight minutes before the Met Museum closed on Monday, November 3, a 19-year-old “damaged multiple exhibits,” the New York Police Department confirmed in an email. The museum has not yet responded to Hyperallergic’s requests for information on which works were damaged, but tabloids reported that the individual threw water at “The Princesse de Broglie” (1851-53) by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and “Madonna and Child with Saints” (c. 1520) by Girolamo dai Libri. He was charged with criminal mischief, police said.\nGoogly Eyes in Australia\nAnother 19-year-old in Australia reportedly stuck googly eyes on a recently installed public sculpture by architects Tom Proctor and Mitch Walker, nicknamed “Blue Blob,” the BBC reported. She appeared this week in court for property damage to the $89,000 sculpture, which is really called “Cast in Blue.” But the real damage seems to have been committed by the people who removed the googly eyes, tearing away the blue paint.\nThe 19-year-old charged with putting googly eyes on a sculpture in Australia made the altered artwork her Facebook profile photo. (screenshot Isa Farfan/Hyperallergic via Facebook)\nHow did they steal 1,000 collection items?\nLast month, suspected thieves took around 1,000 collection items from the Oakland Museum of California that were stored at an off-site location. Police released video footage this week of two individuals apparently scoping out what appears to be a storage facility. It does not, however, show the thieves making off with the absurd number of objects.  \nItty-bitty Picasso Found\nRemember the iPhone-sized painting by Pablo Picasso that went missing in Spain last month, ahead of its scheduled shipment to a Granada museum? Turns out, a neighbor named Dolores had accidentally picked up the package, and it never made it onto the delivery van in the first place. Case closed for everyone except for Dolores, who anxiously gave an interview to El País last week to clear her name.\nLost and found: Pablo Picasso’s “Naturaleza muerta con guitarra (Still life with a guitar)” (1919) (courtesy CajaGranada Fundación)\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsa Farfan is a staff reporter for Hyperallergic.

    "body": "\nOf all the multimillion-dollar artworks available for sale at Sotheby’s this month, only Maurizio Cattelan’s gold toilet has its own rope barrier.\nThe 223-pound, fully operational 18-karat “America” (2016), consigned by hedge fund billionaire and Mets owner Steve Cohen, is expected to fetch roughly $10 million, or about one-third of Mets first baseman Pete Alonso’s 2025 salary. \nFor now, it rests in a brightly lit mirrored room in the auction house’s new headquarters in the iconic Breuer Building at 945 Madison Avenue, which is opening to the public on Saturday, November 8. But don’t even think about putting your butt on that gilded throne.\n\nThe outside of the Breuer Building \n“At the Guggenheim, it was used but we’re not going to do that here,” Lisa Dennison, Sotheby’s Americas Chairman told Hyperallergic. “You can’t sit on the art.” \nAt a press preview earlier today, Friday, November 7, Sotheby’s CEO Charles Stewart said the opportunity to show the world’s most valuable artworks and collectibles in a museum setting was one they could not pass up.\n“We want more people to access, to experience, to learn, to discover, and ultimately to own fine art and luxury objects,” he told a crowd at the press preview on Friday. “For us, the Breuer Building is a key gateway to explore and develop those opportunities.”\nThe interior of the Breuer building, with artworks for sale\nThat includes the art market. It has been volatile, with sales down 12% in 2024 to $57.5 billion, according to a report by Art Basel and UBS. \nMadeline Lissner, executive vice president for Sotheby’s global fine art division, believes the market is beginning to turn around, and that purchasing the Breuer Building would help expand its audience.\n“We are free and open to the public,” she told Hyperallergic. “Auction houses are the best-kept secret in the art world.”\n\nA view of the Cindy and Jay Pritzker Collection in the interior of the Breuer building\nThe auction house purchased Marcel Breuer’s iconic Brutalist building in 2023 from the Whitney Museum for $100 million to serve as its new headquarters. \nThe Whitney had leased the Breuer to the Metropolitan Museum of Art a decade ago before turning the keys over to the Frick, which displayed its priceless Vermeers and Rembrandts for three years before returning to its Fifth Avenue mansion in March.\nFans of previous iterations will notice several changes. Architects Herzog & de Meuron and PBDW enlarged the exhibition area inside the 80,000-square-foot building by nearly 30 percent, restored the lower-level space for a restaurant and sculpture garden, added a new freight elevator, and converted back offices and an art restoration room into additional galleries (Sotheby’s leased four floors of its former York Avenue headquarters for its offices and acquired another building in Long Island City to store its collectibles).\nThe interior of the Breuer Building, with artworks for sale\nThere were a few concessions. Sotheby’s former showroom at 1334 York Avenue had a capacity of 320 people and featured a lazy Susan-like contraption that rotated to reveal different lots available for bid.\nIn the Breuer Building, the fifth-floor gallery will be converted into a showroom for high rollers who need a separate space from the merely wealthy. This complex renovation will involve temporarily removing several sheet rock walls and installing a row of private seats. The new area will have a capacity of around 200 bidders, and art handlers will bring out artworks by hand during auctions.\n\nA Sotheby’s spokesperson talks about the art on view\n“We think it will be a more intimate experience,” Dennison said.\nUnlike the Frick, you can buy whatever you like right off the walls for the right price. Sotheby’s upcoming auctions, beginning the week of November 17, feature an eclectic mix of modern and contemporary masterworks owned by philanthropists including Cindy and Jay Pritzker and the late Leonard Lauder.\nThe highlight of Lauder’s collection is Gustav Klimt’s full-length society portrait, “Bildnis Elisabeth Lederer” (1914–16), which is expected to fetch $150 million and give Amedeo Modigliani’s “Nu Couché” (1917) a run for most expensive sale of the year. \n\nA work by Jeff Koons in the Breuer Building\nBut Lauder also amassed many contemporary paintings, including Agnes Martin’s “The Garden” (1964), which is estimated to sell for more than $10 million, and several small Matisse sculptures.\nThe Pritzkers leaned more toward Impressionists and modern works, with an unusual Vincent van Gogh oil painting of his Parisian apartment, “Piles de romans français et roses dans un verre” (1887), which Sotheby’s expects to go for $40 million. \nOther gallery rooms include standout works from Kerry James Marshall, Rashid Johnson, Antonio Obá, Andrew Wyeth, Mark Rothko, Salvador Dalí, and Frida Kahlo. The first floor features an assemblage of Roy Lichtenstein’s paintings, and the ground floor sculpture garden includes works by John Chamberlain and Anish Kapoor.\n\nHandbags, watches, and jewelry on sale in the Breuer Building\nBut the most surprising exhibition was a series of Hermes handbags, high-end watches, and bejeweled necklaces and earrings in small booths to the left of the main entrance. One Van Cleef & Arpels zip necklace, which was inspired by the Duchess of Windsor in the 1930s, was available for $550,000, or roughly the price of a Murray Hill co-op.\nThe new Sotheby’s building feels truly at home on Madison Avenue, the elite shopping corridor frequented by the free-spending audience it most needs to attract.\n\t",

    "body": "\nWe cherish the seasons for their charms and endure their agonies, and as the cold rains and political races come and go, we scurry to art as a steadfast shelter from the storm. This month, the Hudson Valley invites you to explore exhibitions across the map. At Public Private Gallery, ethereally expressionistic paintings by Kathy Goodell brighten the mood. Hudson Hall presents the curiously macabre photographs of Corrine May Botz, while the Palmer Gallery at Vassar College features futuristic figurative paintings by Larissa Tokmakova. A fun-loving two-woman show at Susan Eley Fine Art highlights the dynamic painting practices of Susan Lisbin and Sasha Hallock. Meanwhile, the Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild offers an encounter with the sublime through photos that celebrate nature, and a group exhibition at Elijah Wheat Showroom continues the festivities with a photography show. November, the penultimate month of the year, we brave your bitter days with happy art in our hearts!\n\nKathy Goodell: In The Darkness I See\nPublic Private Gallery, 530 Columbia Street, Hudson, New YorkThrough November 16\n\nKathy Goodell, “A Perfect Day” (2025), Flashe and acrylic on canvas (courtesy Public Private Gallery / DGFA+Projects, and A. Lin)\nAs Kathy Goodell puts it in the press release for her solo show at Public Private Gallery, “The painting process replicates my internal life of questioning.” In the Darkness I See is a chorus of abstract, impressionist works that whisk us into the lush ambience of Goodell’s energetic practice. Works such as “Taam Jah” (all works 2025) appear to reflect a crowded corner of the ocean with creatures flitting about, while “Murmur” brings to mind a mystical ultramarine forcefield. With its vibrant, illuminated green tone, “One Thousand Years from Now” emanates a healing vibration, and “The Night Belongs to Lovers” is both sensuous and uplifting, with playful and passionate marks moving in all directions against a white background.\n\nCorrine May Botz: Ghosts, Mother’s Milk, and Other Stories\nHudson Hall, 327 Warren Street, Hudson, New YorkThrough November 23\n\nCorrine May Botz, “Kitchen” (2004) from The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death series, c-print, (photo courtesy Hudson Hall)\nWith its macabre and eerie edge, Ghosts, Mother’s Milk, and Other Stories at Hudson Hall is a feast for the psyche. Featuring over 40 photos arranged under themes indicated by the title, Corrine Botz takes us through various chapters of her photographic practice, including a series featuring real-life miniature crime scenes crafted by the criminologist Frances Glessner Lee (The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, 2004). Works such as “Dark Bathroom (tub)” (2004) include a tiny doll with her head in a sink, and “Kitchen” (2004), in which a woman lies face down on the floor. \nThe two other sections of this show are equally captivating: The Milk Factory series includes works such as “Incarcerated Parent” (2019), a vision of a lonely corner of a jail cell where a rocking chair and breast pump machine wait stoically for a mother. Meanwhile, Botz’s Haunted Houses (2010) series includes uncanny works such as “Rhinebeck, New York,” images that reflect her multi-year project documenting haunted sites around the United States.\n\nLarissa Tokmakova: Shelter/Console\nPalmer Gallery at Vassar College, 124 Raymond Avenue, Poughkeepsie, New YorkThrough November 23\n\nLarissa Tokmakova, “Sentinels” (2024–25), oil on canvas (courtesy of Palmer Gallery at Vassar College)\nMy first impression of Larissa Tokmakova’s painting style: a futuristic wrestling match! Featuring a series of dynamic works created over the last decade, Shelter/Console at Palmer Gallery at Vassar College highlights Tokmakova’s powerful painterly style. “Solace” (2023) depicts a creature that appears to be one part cyber-hawk, one part human, while “The Empress” (2018) shows a matronly torso in an abstract environment. Works such as “Untitled 2” (2025) and “Safe II” (2024) feature figure-like formations that seem to dance.\n\nWalkers & Floaters\nCut Teeth, LODGER studio, 394 Hasbrouck Avenue, Kingston, New YorkThrough November 29\n\n\n\nLeft: Installation view of Walkers and Floaters (2025); right: The Small Canteen Kitchen (photo by CHEF HIBINO, both photos courtesy Cut Teeth)\nI was admittedly originally baffled by the description for this show — it took a kind email exchange with artist and chef Leon Johnson to clarify that Walkers & Floaters is an intermedia exhibition “with a performative culinary through-line.” In my own words: It’s an assemblage, a residency, a kitchen-lab, a mobile culinary pop-up, a performance, and still more. Another feature of this “art experience” is a series of mixed-media prints, all untitled and made this year, depicting collage-like tableaus, including a strapping, glistening male torso from behind; a large doll-like male figure traipsing through a bucolic landscape; and the isolated head of a bull set against a map with lines crisscrossing in star-like patterns.\n\nSusan Lisbin & Sasha Hallock: Do You Hear Me—One Day We Will Fly \nSusan Eley Fine Art, 433 Warren Street, Hudson, New YorkThrough November 30\n\n\n\nLeft: Sasha Hallock, “Trumpeter, Small Works No. 139” (2025), oil on linen; right: Susan Lisbin, “Can You Hear Me XI” (2024), oil on canvas (both photos courtesy of the artist and Susan Eley Fine Art, Hudson)\nPairing Susan Lisbin and Sasha Hallock is utter brilliance; their back-and-forth volley of recent paintings celebrates the playfulness of abstraction. Lisbin’s retro style, with its muted colors and slightly surrealist edge, includes works such as “Shields” (2024), in which two isolated anthropomorphic forms are enclosed by white shapes, and “Come Over Me” (2024), in which side-by-side forms are overlaid with mathematical-looking drawings. Hallock’s works, meanwhile, are absolute fun from top to bottom: “The Hard Work of Love” (2025) is a multicolored symphony of abstract shapes set against a black background, while “Trumpeter / Small Works No. 139” (2025) is a figure-like formation that appears to groove wildly in a party of one. \n\nSharing the Space: Women Photographers Collective of the Mid-Hudson Valley\nWoodstock Byrdcliffe Guild, 36 Tinker Street, Woodstock, New YorkThrough November 30\n\nLovell Birge Harrison, “Untitled (View from the Stream)” (1904), pastel, graphite, gouache on woodblock print (photo by Anne Arden McDonald, courtesy Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild)\nThe great aesthetician and philosopher Immanuel Kant described the sublime as “a serious matter in the exercise of the imagination.” Sharing the Space: Women Photographers Collective of the Mid-Hudson Valley at Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild is a supremely sublime vision of Mother Nature, a Kantian thrill of a show. Featuring photographic works by 16 artists, these women take us down dreamy paths and toward splendid mountain ranges. Ana Begen’s “Early Morning” (2024) depicts a crystal blue lake; its cobalt peak will take your breath away. Lovell Birge Harrison’s “Untitled (View from the Stream)” (1904) has a certain gestural charm reminiscent of Van Gogh, while “Winter Treeline” (2020) by Mary Ann Glass is a poetic view of a distant row of trees that activates the gray landscape.\n\nAlone with the Moon: Biff Elrod, Kathryn Lynch, Enrico Riley \nRuthann, 453 Main Street, Catskill, New YorkThrough December 6\n\nBiff Elrod, “Conversation” (2025), oil on canvas (courtesy the artist)\nThe mood of Alone with the Moon at Ruthann, which presents the work of three painters who explore timelessness, is quixotic yet existential. “Broad Street” (2025) by Kathryn Lynch is a gray painting of a nighttime steeple set against a hazy full moon, while Lynch’s “Growth” (2025) depicts a sultry sun above a foggy field. Enrico Riley’s “Untitled: Before the Harvest” (2025) is a painting of a piece of folded green paper that appears poised to be shaped into origami, while “Devotion to the Setting Sun” (2025) is a crinkled pink version of the same. Finally, Biff Elrod’s “Conversation” (2025) celebrates a moment of connection between two women seated and chatting outdoors while their combined shadow casts an abstract silhouette on the street below.\n\nUnfixxxed: A group photography exhibition\nElijah Wheat Showroom, 195 Front Street, Newburgh, New YorkThrough December 14\n\nLauren Silberman, “Un(Holy) Fuck(up)” (2010), archival pigment print face-mounted to plexi (courtesy the artist and Elijah Wheat Showroom)\nThe press release for this group show at Elijah Wheat Showroom starts with a poignant quote by the late Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thích Nhat Hanh: “Thanks to impermanence, everything is possible.” Photography is that magical medium that captures the impermanent moments of existence. See, for instance, “Two Candles” (2020) by Jackie Furtado, in which one candle burns endlessly while the other lies flat and extinguished. Lauren Silberman’s “Un(Holy) Fuck(up)” (2010) takes us into the morning after a party, with erratic graffiti on the wall above a long red couch and beer cans littered about. Jon Verney’s “Bather” (2021) is an archival pigment print that looks like a cross between luscious melting ice cream and broken glass. Shirin Neshat’s “Passage Series” (2001), meanwhile, is a powerful image of a group of women in black chadors; as they claw at the sandy ground, the resulting dust cloud creates a ghost-like shroud around them.\n\nJody Isaacson: Holding Artemis\nThe Roxbury Arts Group, 5025 Vega Mountain Road, Roxbury, New YorkThrough December 20\n\nJody Isaacson, “Watcher” (2023), stoneware, sticks (courtesy James Shanks and Roxbury Arts Group)\nRoaming the forests of ancient Greek mythology is Artemis, goddess of the wilderness and the hunt. Holding Artemis at Roxbury Arts Group presents Jody Isaacson’s interpretation of this sacred woman figure through a series of mixed-media pieces that employ arrows, birchbark, raku, and other mediums of expression. “Watcher” (2023) is a stoic stoneware bird poised atop a branch that matches the color of its brown body, while “Spoon” (2025) features two multicolored bird-like shapes that rest side by side. “Thunderbirds” (2024) consists of pottery pieces that appear to take flight upward together; their majestic hand-painted forms seem to embody the mythical lifeblood of Artemis in contemporary times. \n\nSeeking Complexity\nBill Arning Exhibitions, 17 Broad Street, Kinderhook, New YorkThrough December 21\n\nBrian Kenny, “1 2 3 GOD” (2023), oil on canvas (courtesy of Bill Arning Exhibitions)\nSeeking Complexity at Bill Arning Exhibitions features a motley mix of snazzy works by eight artists. The fun starts with “Sir Lady” (2025) by Deborah Bright, a colorful Pop-inspired portrait of a gender-fluid figure. Brian Kenny’s “1 2 3 GOD” (2023) is a compelling contemporary still-life painting of skeletons, skulls, and other monster-like creatures in a strange domestic setting. The found wood sculpture “Ferry, Carry, Bear, Take, Yield” (2025) by AJ Liberto looks like a mini architectural temple constructed with felled maple and rocks. Harrison Tenzer’s “Untitled” (2025) from his Projections series is a swirling oceanic vision that recalls Hokusai’s iconic “The Great Wave off Kanagawa” (1831). Note: This show is Bill Arning’s swan song presentation before he closes his storefront gallery in Kinderhook next month!\n\t",

    "body": "\n\tAcademy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence is the subject of W magazine’s current art issue.\n\n\tIn 2006, the fashion-focused publication launched this collaborative series with fashion photographer Mario Sorrenti shooting contemporary American artist Richard Tuttle. Since then, there have been many examples of collaborations between high-profile artists and celebrities, for example, Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch directing a shoot starring Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid in 2016, Mickalene Thomas photographing Cardi B. in 2018, and Robert Longo shooting Nicole Kidman as one of his “men” in the city last year. \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThis year’s iteration features Lawrence in a three-part collaboration with French filmmaker and artist Philippe Parreno, American painter Elizabeth Peyton, and German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans.\n\n\tParreno shot a short film starring Lawrence. In one scene, the actress stares intensely at the camera, silently depicting a range of emotions as prompted by Parreno—inner turmoil, calm, anxiety, joy, and sorrow. Towards the end of the clip, she turns away, leaving her shoulders and back square to the camera. The parting image brings to mind Gerhard Richter’s famous portrait of his daughter, Betty (1988), which is itself a reference to Ingres’s The Bather at Valpinçon (1808).\n\n\tTillmans, for his part, photographed Lawrence at his London studio, wearing a black T-shirt shirt bearing the title of his recent exhibition at the Centre Pompidou: “Nothing could have prepared us – Everything could have prepared us.”\n\n\tLastly, Lawrence sat for a portrait by Peyton, painted in the artist’s recognizably loose, romantic style.\n\n\tThe art issue has three different covers of the actress, with one dedicated to the work of each collaborating artist.\n\n\tIn the accompanying article, Lawrence spoke passionately about the artists with whom she worked: The dialogue Parreno wrote for his film was “almost Ang Lee–like”, while Peyton is “so much smarter than me in every conceivable way.” \n\n\tLawrence’s new film, Die, My Love, which co-starts Robert Pattison and is based on a novel by Ariana Harwicz, was released in theaters on November 7.\n",

    "body": "\n\tSotheby’s did not just open a new headquarters this week—it staged a return to form. \n\n\tThe auction house has taken over Marcel Breuer’s Brutalist landmark on Madison Avenue, a building that has already lived several cultural lives: it was the longtime home of the Whitney Museum, then the Met Breuer, followed by a short-lived contemporary art annex of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a temporary Frick Collection outpost. Now, after a renovation by Herzog & de Meuron, Breuer’s building becomes something else again—not a museum, exactly, but a museum-sized showroom.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe building’s architectural bones remain unmistakable. The cantilevered granite façade, the deep-set windows, the weight of postwar seriousness. What’s new is what happens inside. Herzog & de Meuron’s self-described “quasi-invisible” intervention was a matter of subtraction more than addition: removing office partitions, restoring original gallery proportions, and installing the kind of climate, sound, and lighting systems expected of an auction house that can sell a painting for the price of a Manhattan skyscraper. \n\n\tVisitors entering the lobby are immediately pulled between spectacle and restraint. On one wall hangs a monumental Damien Hirst cherry-blossom painting, while opposite it is a hard-edged, rainbow-hued concentric square work by Frank Stella. To the left stands a hefty Jean Arp sculpture. Vitrines display jewelry from Cartier and David Webb, Rolexes, Patek Phillippes, and of course a limited edition Birkin Bag, under surgical lighting; to the right, rare manuscripts including a first editions of The Hobbit and Alice in Wonderland — a visual split-screen of glamour and scholarship. The ceilings are still lined with Breuer’s saucer-like fixtures. The terrazzo flooring, studiously grey, and the classic stone walls are intact, giving the lobby an elegant, sturdy feel that just on the secular side of ecclesiastic. But the building has shifted from contemplation to transaction, or, as Sotheby’s might argue, from passive viewing to active circulation.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSotheby’s Breuer lobby gallery, featuring works from the Collection of Dorothy and Roy Lichtenstein.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhotography by Stefan Ruiz. Courtesy of Sotheby’s\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSotheby’s is inaugurating the space not with a single sale, but with a sequence of exhibitions that behave like a full-scale biennial of private wealth. Three truly exceptional single-owner collections — Leonard A. Lauder, Cindy and Jay Pritzker, and Exquisite Corpus — anchor the November season, together estimated at over a billion dollars on the high end, double last year’s total for the same season.\n\n\n\tFrom the Lauder trove come three Gustav Klimts, each appearing at auction for the first time; from the Pritzker collection, a Van Gogh still life the house is billing as one of the artist’s finest examples still in private hands; and from Exquisite Corpus, a Frida Kahlo painting positioned to reset the record for a woman artist at auction. The contemporary evening sale centers on Basquiat’s Crowns (Peso Neto) and Maurizio Cattelan’s fully functional 18-karat gold toilet, America — a work whose opening bid will be pegged to the price of gold at the moment the gavel drops. \n\n\tAll of it is free for the public to view until the hammer falls.\n\n\tWith this move, Sotheby’s essentially turns an art-historical landmark into a commercial one. Unlike the old York Avenue HQ — a place you visited because you already had business there — the Breuer building will cater to walk-ins, tourists, collectors, influencers, and the merely curious. It’s a bet that the aura of museum-quality viewing can be merged with the velocity of high-end sales.\n\n\tWhile the building is smaller that York Ave, it’s purpose is more singular and feels that way. Movable walls will allow the fourth gallery to transform into the sales floor on auction days albeit with a bit less room. York Ave. had room for just over 300 in person visitors for a sale. The Breuer has room for 200. To make up for that, the house has upped its live streaming game so that people viewing from home will “feel like that are in the room,” according to Lisa Dennison, Sotheby’s executive vice president and chairman, America’s. (Lisa, who for years worked at the Guggenheim gave the press a lovely a tour of the galleries and sales highlights, which started off with her pointing out that “I guess you can take the museum out of the girl but you can’t take the girl out of the museum.”)\n\n\tBefore the tours started, CEO Charles Stewart called the upcoming November sales the “biggest and best we’ve had in recent memory.” The subtext: Sotheby’s has spent the last five years building a global real-estate portfolio meant to match the geography of wealth; Hong Kong, Paris, now New York again — but with Madison Avenue prestige.\n\n\tWhether this is a profound shift or a glamorously staged real-estate maneuver depends on how you define “public.” The art is free to see, but only until it is bought. The Breuer has always held art temporarily; this just shortens the timeline. But it’s a wonderfully chic (re)addition to Madison Ave and the New York art world as a whole.\n",

    "body": "\n\tin Education, Math |   \tJanuary 7th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWilliam Gib­son famous­ly observed that the future is already here, it’s just not even­ly dis­trib­uted. That line is often thought to have been inspired by Japan, which was already pro­ject­ing a thor­ough­ly futur­is­tic image, at least in pop­u­lar cul­ture, by the time he made his debut with Neu­ro­mancer in 1984. But as any­one who’s spent enough time in the coun­try under­stands — albeit not with­out frus­tra­tion — even twen­ty-first-cen­tu­ry Japan remains in many ways a pre-dig­i­tal soci­ety. Many busi­ness­es only take cash, more than a few ser­vices require com­mu­ni­ca­tion by fax, and there’s no sub­sti­tute for a phys­i­cal han­ko seal on impor­tant doc­u­ments. Even so, it may come as a sur­prise to learn that Japan still uses aba­cus­es.\nOr rather, Japan still uses aba­cus­es as edu­ca­tion­al tools: you won’t see many shop­keep­ers pull them out while ring­ing up your pur­chas­es, but if you glance in the win­dow of the right kind of pri­vate acad­e­my, you might well see young stu­dents furi­ous­ly per­form­ing cal­cu­la­tions the very old-fash­ioned way.\nIf they’re suf­fi­cient­ly advanced, as explained in the BBC video above, they won’t even have actu­al aba­cus­es; they’ll just move around beads pic­tured in their heads. (It brings to mind how Dustin Hoff­man’s savant in Rain Man explains his per­for­mance of seem­ing­ly impos­si­ble men­tal math: “I see it.”) Such inten­sive aba­cus edu­ca­tion was com­mon across north­east Asia in the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry, when the arith­metic skills it cul­ti­vat­ed were impor­tant for both indi­vid­ual sur­vival and nation­al devel­op­ment.\nIt was that very devel­op­ment that tend­ed to push the aba­cus into obso­les­cence. When Korea, where I live, could afford elec­tron­ic cal­cu­la­tors, the pres­tige asso­ci­at­ed with aba­cus mas­tery dis­solved prac­ti­cal­ly overnight. Deter­mined Kore­an par­ents can still sign their chil­dren up for jupan class­es, much as Chi­nese par­ents might encour­age theirs to enter into suan­pan com­pe­ti­tions out of a sense of civ­i­liza­tion­al pride, but they have noth­ing like the sta­tus the soroban enjoys in Japan. That may be vin­di­cat­ed by neu­ro­sci­en­tif­ic research point­ing toward the ben­e­fits learn­ing the aba­cus can have on a devel­op­ing brain’s cog­ni­tive func­tions. As the BBC video explains, aba­cus train­ing enhances cog­ni­tive func­tion by sharp­en­ing con­cen­tra­tion, accel­er­at­ing infor­ma­tion pro­cess­ing, and strength­en­ing visu­al mem­o­ry, lead­ing to improved mem­o­ry and sus­tained focus. But as any enthu­si­ast of Japan­ese craft cul­ture knows, no mat­ter how much hard­er it may be to do things with ana­log tools, some­times it’s just more sat­is­fy­ing.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nFree Online Math Cours­es\nThe Won­der­ful Wood­en Mar­ble Adding Machine\nThe Math­e­mat­ics Behind Origa­mi, the Ancient Japan­ese Art of Paper Fold­ing\nCom­plex Math Made Sim­ple With Engag­ing Ani­ma­tions: Fouri­er Trans­form, Cal­cu­lus, Lin­ear Alge­bra, Neur­al Net­works & More\nJapan­ese Musi­cians Turn Obso­lete Machines Into Musi­cal Instru­ments: Cath­ode Ray Tube TVs, Over­head Pro­jec­tors, Reel-to-Reel Tape Machines & More\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Design, History, Religion |   \tJanuary 6th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt was long ago that poly­the­ism, as the sto­ry comes down to us, gave way to monothe­ism. Human­i­ty used to have many gods, and now almost every reli­gious believ­er acknowl­edges just one — though which god, exact­ly, does vary. Some pop­u­lar the­o­ries of “big his­to­ry” hold that, as the scale of a soci­ety grows larg­er, the num­ber of deities pro­posed by its faiths gets small­er. In that scheme, it makes sense that the grow­ing Roman Empire would even­tu­al­ly adopt Chris­tian­i­ty, and also that the gods it first inher­it­ed from the city-states of ancient Greece would be so numer­ous. Through our mod­ern eyes, the var­i­ous immor­tals invoked so read­i­ly by the Greeks look less like holy fig­ures than a cast of char­ac­ters in a long-run­ning tele­vi­sion dra­ma.\nOr maybe it would have to be a soap opera, giv­en that most of them belong to one big, often trou­bled clan. Hence the struc­ture of Use­fulCharts’ Greek Mythol­o­gy Fam­i­ly Tree, explained in the video above. Also avail­able for pur­chase in poster form, it clear­ly dia­grams the rela­tion­ships between every­one in the Greek pan­theon, from the high­est “pri­mor­dial gods” like Eros Elder and Gaia down to the chil­dren of Zeus and Posei­don.\nHow­ev­er pow­er­ful they could be — and some were pow­er­ful indeed — none of these gods act­ed like the infal­li­ble, omni­scient enti­ties of the major reli­gions we know today. They could act capri­cious­ly, venge­ful­ly and even non­sen­si­cal­ly, a reflec­tion of the often capricious‑, vengeful‑, and non­sen­si­cal-seem­ing nature of life in the ancient world.\nFor the Greeks them­selves, these myth­i­cal gods and mon­sters offered not just an explana­to­ry mech­a­nism, but also a form of enter­tain­ment, giv­en that noth­ing could go on in their ele­vat­ed world with­out high dra­ma. For us, they remain present in leg­ends from which we still draw inspi­ra­tion for our own larg­er-than-life sto­ries of hero­ism and vil­lainy, but also in our very lan­guage. Con­sid­er the ways in which we con­tin­ue to evoke the likes of the time-rul­ing Chronos, the love-bring­ing Cupid, the androg­y­nous Her­maph­ro­di­tus, or the mul­ti-head­ed Hydra in every­day speech. Though we may no longer need them to orga­nize our soci­eties, some of them have kept play­ing roles in the age of monothe­ism — which, what­ev­er its oth­er advan­tages, does­n’t require us to con­sult dia­grams to know who’s who.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nMythos: An Ani­ma­tion Retells Time­less Greek Myths with Abstract Mod­ern Designs\nMythol­o­gy Expert Reviews Depic­tions of Greek & Roman Myths in Pop­u­lar Movies and TV Shows\nHow the Ancient Greeks Built Their Mag­nif­i­cent Tem­ples: The Art of Ancient Engi­neer­ing\n18 Clas­sic Myths Explained with Ani­ma­tion: Pandora’s Box, Sisy­phus & More\nCon­cepts of the Hero in Greek Civ­i­liza­tion (A Free Har­vard Course)\nA Visu­al Time­line of World His­to­ry: Watch the Rise & Fall of Civ­i­liza­tions Over 5,000 Years\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Nature, Photography, Science |   \tJanuary 6th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nAre we tru­ly in the midst of a human-caused sixth mass extinc­tion, an era of “bio­log­i­cal anni­hi­la­tion”? Many sci­en­tists and pop­u­lar sci­ence writ­ers say yes, using terms like “Holocene” or “Anthro­pocene” to describe what fol­lows the Ordovi­cian, Devon­ian, Per­mi­an, Tri­as­sic, and Cre­ta­ceous peri­ods. Peter Bran­nen, the author of extinc­tion his­to­ry The Ends of the Earth has found at least one sci­en­tist who thinks the con­cept is “junk.” But Bran­nen quotes some alarm­ing sta­tis­tics. Chill­ing, even. “Until very recent­ly,” he writes, “all ver­te­brate life on the plan­et was wildlife. But astound­ing­ly, today wildlife accounts for only 3 per­cent of Earth’s land ani­mals; human beings, our live­stock, and our pets take up the remain­ing 97 per­cent of the bio­mass… almost half of the Earth’s land has been con­vert­ed into farm­land.”\n\nThis state of affairs does not bode well for the mil­lions of remain­ing species get­ting edged out of their envi­ron­ments by agribusi­ness and cli­mate change. We learn from extinc­tions past that the plan­et rebounds after unimag­in­able cat­a­stro­phe. Life real­ly does go on, though it may take mil­lions of years to recov­er. But the cur­rent forms of life may dis­ap­pear before their time. If we want to under­stand what is at stake besides our own frag­ile fos­sil-fuel-based civ­i­liza­tions, we need to con­nect to life emo­tion­al­ly as well as intel­lec­tu­al­ly. Short of globe-hop­ping phys­i­cal immer­sion in the Earth’s bio­di­ver­si­ty, we could hard­ly do bet­ter than immers­ing our­selves in the tra­di­tion of nat­u­ral­ist writ­ing, art, and pho­tog­ra­phy that brings the world to us.\n\nThe Bio­di­ver­si­ty Her­itage Library (BHL), an “open access dig­i­tal library for bio­di­ver­si­ty lit­er­a­ture and archives,” has for many years been mak­ing it easy for peo­ple to con­nect to nature through nature writ­ing and illus­tra­tion. On Flickr, you can find 319,000 care­ful­ly curat­ed images. The col­lec­tion itself is sub­di­vid­ed into dif­fer­ent pho­to albums drawn from his­tor­i­cal pub­li­ca­tions. For exam­ple, The Fresh­wa­ter Fish­es of the British Isles (1911), The Bird (1869), and The Insect Book (1901).\n\nThis image archive offers expan­sive views of human­i­ty’s encounter with the nat­ur­al world, not only through sta­tis­tics and aca­d­e­m­ic jar­gon, but through the artis­tic record­ing of won­der, sci­en­tif­ic curios­i­ty, and deep appre­ci­a­tion.

It’s all in the name of the firm, The Wicker Story, which was founded in 2019 by architect Priyanka Narula. Capable of being formed into everything from abstract constructions to functional objects, the natural material lends itself a huge variety of pieces that vary in size and complexity.\nWicker is a common technique used for basket-weaving and other applications in India, and The Wicker Story evolved out of a fascination with the geometry and math inherent in traditional Indian pieces. The material and process nods to a time-honored aesthetic while emphasizing organic forms, fluidity, and experimentation.\n“Flowering Vines”\nA swirling plane descending from a light fixture, a bean-shaped bench, and a bulbous floor lamp are just a couple of The Wicker Story’s woven creations. Botanicals often provide reference points, as abstracted petals and vine-like tendrils often complement the compositions.\nAfter refining the possibilities of the technique, including colorful dyes and a range of forms, the studio is honing a core collection that will continue to mature and grow. “We are currently translating those traditional wicker techniques into metal weaving; it’s a rigorous research-and-development process that we look forward to debuting fully next year,” the studio says.\nSee more on The Wicker Story’s website and Instagram.\n“Bark Bench”\nTWS x Seraspire lighting feature collaboration\n“Bark Lamp”\n“Imli Bench”\n“Flower” installation\n“Bow Bench 1”\n“Sunset Beach”\n“Bloom”\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn the early 20th century, Russia underwent a series of drastic and devastating changes. After centuries of imperial rule, the 1917 Russian Revolution put an end to the Romanov dynasty and hailed the start of a new era under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, head of the Bolshevik Party. This government body eventually became known as the Communist Party, and Russia was dubbed the Union of Soviet Social Republicans, or the U.S.S.R.\nIn 1927, everything changed again. Lenin died that year, and a new leader maneuvered into power: Joseph Stalin. Fundamentally a dictator, Stalin ruled through terror and used violence and oppressive tactics to instill a government-controlled society. His approach essentially defines totalitarianism, in which the state asserts absolute dominance over every aspect of people’s lives and livelihoods.\n\n\n\nIn 1937, 10 years into the Stalinist period, the short film “Father’s Letters” opens. Written and directed by Alexey Evstigneev, the animation traces a narrative of correspondence between a real-life father, Professor Vangengheim, and his daughter Eleonora, who he calls Elya.\nVangengheim was a weather forecaster for Stalin, and he headed up the U.S.S.R.’s meteorology department—a role that had great implications for the success of socialist agriculture practices. When a ruinous famine hit between 1932 and 1933, Vangengheim was scapegoated with a claim that he had falsified weather forecasts to sabotage the crops. In January 1934, he was arrested and transported to the remote Solovetsky Islands, near the Arctic Circle.\nEleonora, who lived in Moscow, witnessed nationalist demonstrations and was largely shielded from the knowledge that her father was banished to a remote outpost of the Soviet Gulag. In his letters, written on cigarette-rolling paper, Vangengheim details his “expedition,” describing how he is researching plant life in the Arctic. The real letters were preserved by Eleonora and later published.\n\nThe Gulag system was established shortly after the Russian Revolution, and Stalin actively expanded it. It’s estimated that around 18 million people passed through the Gulag, and more than than a quarter did not survive. The film’s emphasis on 1937 marks a particularly terrible time during Stalin’s rule known as the Great Purge, or the Great Terror, of which the sole purpose was eradicating people who disagreed with the dictator’s philosophy.\nThose thought to be traitors of the state were arrested, imprisoned, and executed—often without trial—in a wholesale expulsion of people who threatened Communist ideals and Stalin’s absolute power. This included persecuting political rivals, bureaucrats, and intellectuals—because only the state could determine what information, art, or “truths” the public had access to.\nStalin’s secret police, known as the NKVD, officially counted more than 680,000 individuals who were shot between 1937 and 1938, but scholars estimate that the entire number of fatalities during the Great Purge could be double that.\n\nFor Evstigneev, this horrific period sets the stage for a poignant tale of love, innocence, and hope as well as a stark reflection of the cruelty of the Gulag. A team of animators and producers worked with the director to create a painterly world that combines hand-drawn pastel elements, a two-dimensional vector-based technique, and stop-motion. \nWhile imprisoned, Vangengheim is forced to work on a portrait of Stalin made of dandelions, however when he damages the tribute, he meets a grisly fate. In real life, his family didn’t learn of his death until nearly two decades later.\nIn Evstigneev’s film, Elya reads of her father’s “explorations” in the north and is reminded of the life cycle of flowers and their floating seeds, encouraging her to focus on future growth.

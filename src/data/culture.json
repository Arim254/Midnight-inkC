    "body": "\n\tin Art, Life |   \tJanuary 9th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nTrevor Noah end­ed his stint as the host of The Dai­ly Show a lit­tle over three years ago, but he’s made him­self into anoth­er kind of pop-cul­tur­al pres­ence since then. In evi­dence, we have his appear­ance above on the pop­u­lar pod­cast and YouTube show Diary of a CEO. For more than two and a half hours, Noah dis­cuss­es with host Steven Bartlett (who, like Noah, also hap­pens to be African-born with mixed parent­age) his rea­sons for quit­ting that polit­i­cal-news-com­e­dy TV insti­tu­tion, his strug­gles with depres­sion, and the time his step­fa­ther shot his moth­er in the head. She lived, owing to the mirac­u­lous­ly unlike­ly tra­jec­to­ry of the bul­let, but that did­n’t stop the expe­ri­ence from becom­ing what Noah describes as the worst of his life.\nDis­cussing all this brings to his mind the Japan­ese art of kintsu­gi (pre­vi­ous­ly fea­tured here on Open Cul­ture). “It’s a prac­tice of repair­ing pot­tery and ceram­ics that have bro­ken,” Noah explains. “What hap­pens is, you break a plate, or you break a vase or some­thing,” and “they put it back togeth­er, these arti­sans who do it. But they don’t just glue it back togeth­er, they glue it back togeth­er and they sort of adorn it with a gold­en bind­ing. And what you get is an object that is some­how more beau­ti­ful than before it was bro­ken.”\nKintsu­gi struck him as “one of the most beau­ti­ful con­cepts, and a dif­fer­ent way to think about being ‘fixed’ or ‘over­com­ing’ ”; it was­n’t “the idea that we are per­fect, the way we were before some­thing hap­pened to us, but rather, it is that we get to wear our cracks with a new type of pride, and a new type of beau­ty.”\nNoah would hard­ly be the only per­son to see in these recon­sti­tut­ed ceram­ic ves­sels with their gleam­ing kintsu­gi seams a metaphor for him­self. Like more than a few pub­lic fig­ures in the West, he’s been will­ing to dis­cuss the vicis­si­tudes of his life in detail, and even use them for mate­r­i­al in work like his stand-up com­e­dy and his mem­oir Born a Crime. But it is unusu­al, in a chat like this with mil­lions and mil­lions of view­ers, to hear ref­er­ence made to a half-mil­len­ni­um-old Japan­ese form of pot­tery repair. That pos­si­bil­i­ty, of course, is cen­tral to the appeal of long-form inter­view pod­casts, whose con­ver­sa­tions have the time and space to go far down unex­pect­ed paths. The Dai­ly Show may deliv­er more laughs per minute, but giv­en its for­mat’s time con­straints, kintsu­gi-type talk is no doubt the first thing to get edit­ed out — and the cut cer­tain­ly won’t be high­light­ed.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nA Visu­al Intro­duc­tion to Kintsu­gi, the Japan­ese Art of Repair­ing Bro­ken Pot­tery and Find­ing Beau­ty in Imper­fec­tion\nHow Japan­ese Kintsu­gi Mas­ters Restore Pot­tery by Beau­ti­fy­ing the Cracks\nDavid Lynch Explains Why Depres­sion Is the Ene­my of Cre­ativ­i­ty — and Why Med­i­ta­tion Is the Solu­tion\nStanford’s Robert Sapol­sky Demys­ti­fies Depres­sion, Which, Like Dia­betes, Is Root­ed in Biol­o­gy\nStephen Fry on Cop­ing with Depres­sion: It’s Rain­ing, But the Sun Will Come Out Again\nCharles Bukows­ki Explains How to Beat Depres­sion: Spend 3–4 Days in Bed and You’ll Get the Juices Flow­ing Again (NSFW)\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nBy marrying the realistic with the fantastical and uncanny, Stephanie Temma Hier conjures tension: there’s a calf-hair necktie that morphs into a table fan, popcorn surrounding pink ballet shoes, and a rapt snake framed by orange igneous rocks.\nThe Brooklyn-based artist is formally trained as a painter and self-taught as a ceramicist, and she fuses the two modes of working into a complementary practice. Hier begins by sculpting a wide range of forms, and after several rounds of firing with both handmade and commercially available glazes, she adds a painting. The pairings arise intuitively, sometimes through free association, trial and error, or by homing in on a color.\n\nEarlier works include a decadent, three-tiered cake piped not with pillowy buttercream but instead trimmed with olives, sausages, and thin slices of prosciutto. There’s also a thick head of green cabbage that reveals a trio of ravenous chicks roosted in its core. While the artist’s depictions in both clay and paint are lifelike, the juxtapositions push the works firmly into the realm of the surreal and ambiguous.\nMany of the works shown here will debut this month at Anton Kern Gallery for Hier’s solo exhibition, Swan Song. Nodding to the ancient Greek belief that the otherwise “mute” birds sing just before their deaths, the exhibition takes transformation as its starting point. Elements of Dutch still lifes appear, too, as flowers bloom and pastries and coffee are consumed across a picnic-esque surface.\nHier created the Swan Song pieces simultaneously, allowing motifs and themes to recur throughout. The titular bird, for example, appears in several works, from the feathered chair with thick, stocky webbed legs to the intimate portrait encircled by an array of speckled shoes. Together, the mixed-media pieces create a sort of domestic tableau that unsettles in its familiarity, presenting a fantastic world in which the only inevitabilities are the unexpected and change.\nSwan Song is on view from January 14 to February 21 in New York. Find more from the artist on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn 1666, the marriage of Emperor Leopold I and Infanta Margarita Teresa of Spain solidified a political alliance between the Austrian and Spanish sides of the Habsburg family. They were also both uncle and niece and first cousins, such was the intense insularity of royal marriages intended to gain or maintain power across Europe.\nThe union was arranged while Margarita Teresa was very young—she was only around 15 when they married—and during the years leading up to the wedding, court painter Diego Velázquez created numerous portraits of her, which were sent to Leopold I in the form of tokens or updates documenting the imperial bride’s development into a young woman. \n“Them, after Hodges, Kruseman, Batoni and Skirving” (2022-25), oil on linen in four individually framed ovals, dimensions variable: medium 7.5 x 9.5 centimeters; large 9 x 11.9 centimeters\nFor Derrick Guild, portraits of the likes of the Infanta and the Spanish royal family, such as Velázquez’s seminal “Las Meninas,” provide the starting point for a painting practice that examines social status, mores, and expectations. Through 17th- and 18th-century portraits, Guild examines art as a vehicle for social and diplomatic relations, considering how painting was used to impart very specific messages and emphasize prestige.\nHis “Label Infanta Margarita, after Velazquez and del Mazo,” for example, reproduces a portrait of the Spanish princess across a gridded composition of paper luggage tags, nodding to the harsh reality that the young woman’s sole role in life was to essentially be shipped off to marry well and produce heirs.\nMargarita Teresa had four children (and two miscarriages) during her six-year marriage to Leopold I. She died at the age of 22, and only one of her children lived to adulthood. The grid-like composition, set against a black background, also invokes a cage behind which the young woman is confined.\nTags are a recurring motif in Guild’s paintings, which combine trompe l’oeil details of paper and ribbon with intimate details of art historical pieces. In addition to the reference to shipping, they’re also evocative of labels used to identify and organize objects into place.\n“Label Infanta Maria Theresa, after workshop of Velázquez” (2025), oil on linen, 65 x 85 centimeters\nGuild is interested in the distortions and layered meanings of historic portraiture. Along with large-scale paintings, the artist also creates tender assemblies of smaller works in oval, gold frames, sometimes connected by gold-plated chains. Eyes are often encapsulated in their own frames, and it’s hard to escape the feeling of being watched.\nThese tiny, fragmented pieces also hone in on elegant hands, sensuous lips, jewelery, and fabrics, nodding to the tradition of painted miniatures. Often elaborately detailed for their size, these tiny portraits served as diplomatic gifts, keepsakes, tokens of love, and ways to commemorate people or events. They were a key element of introducing eligible men and women to prospective wives and husbands, and in aristocratic circles, social climbing was a not-so-hidden goal. Before photography, in the courtship scene, they were a kind of profile picture.\nIf you enjoy this work, you may also like Robyn Rich’s miniature eye pieces derived from Georgian portraits or the eccentric paintings of Volker Hermes, alongside whom Guild recently exhibited at James Freeman Gallery.

The group is perhaps best known for hosting the World Summit on Arts and Culture, whose 10th edition last year gathered artists and industry leaders to discuss topics including artificial intelligence, Indigenous knowledge, and fair working conditions.Members of IFACCA include representatives for more than 70 countries, including the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the US arts funding agency that Trump has sought to dismantle. As of today, the NEA is still listed as a member on IFACCA's website. Hyperallergic has contacted IFACCA's executive director, Magdalena Moreno Mujica, as well as the NEA for comment. Established in 1959 in response to mass cultural heritage loss during World War II, the ICCROM focuses on disaster risk management and conservation of historic sites, monuments, museum collections, and other forms of artistic patrimony. Its work includes training experts, leading research, and encouraging international bodies to cooperate on preservation. In September 2024, ICCROM partnered with the US State Department to help safeguard Ukrainian cultural sites under threat from Russian attacks. In a statement shared with Hyperallergic, ICCROM said the US had been a member since 1971 and that its withdrawal “will have a direct impact on ICCROM’s core capacities, with consequences for the Organization’s ability to deliver on its mandate.”Hermann Parzinger, executive president of the pan-European cultural heritage group Europa Nostra, also decried the move, particularly in light of Trump's “deplorable withdrawal” from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) last July.“This sweeping retreat from multilateral cooperation of a major global player seems to signal a troubling misunderstanding of the essential role that culture and heritage play in fostering peace, mutual respect, resilience, innovation, and shared prosperity across the globe,” Parzinger said.Around half of the entities in the White House memo are connected to the United Nations, and several address clean energy and the environment, including the high-profile UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the basis of international efforts to address global warming. But the list also includes a multilateral counterterrorism body, a UN office dedicated to preventing violence against children, and a coalition working to protect internet freedom, suggesting a broad criteria and unclear priorities.Advocates and officials warned that Trump's mass exodus from these efforts could have disastrous consequences for human rights worldwide. The president's distancing from global cooperation on urgent issues such as the climate emergency comes just a week after the US attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, and in the wake of Trump's renewed threats to seize Greenland from Denmark.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

Although it is LA’s longest-running art fair, the show is somewhat of an outcast, snubbed as pedestrian, too commercial, and out of touch with the cutting edge of the global art world. But at the rear of the cavernous exhibition hall, a pair of projects organized by curator Marisa Caichiolo gives visitors a sense of the fair’s cultural and political relevance.Caichiolo organized the first Latin American Pavilion at the fair, a modest group of three booths: Artier Gallery from Palm Springs, Verse Gallery from Ft. Lauderdale, and Building Bridges Art Exchange, the LA-based nonprofit she founded in 2005. The display also features selections from the Pangue International Video Art Festival, with video works by 20 contemporary artists from Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Chile, and elsewhere. “They’re artists that people here may not know, but they're so powerful in their own communities,” Caichiolo told Hyperallergic.Artier Gallery's booth at the 2026 LA Art Show with works by Natasha Grey, Carlos Luna James, and Dario OrtizAlthough the fair is international in scope, with a strong focus on Asia, there has historically been less representation from Latin America, something Caichiolo hopes to begin to correct with this first pavilion and expand upon in subsequent editions.The entrance of Artier Gallery’s booth is framed by Mexico City-based artist Natasha Grey’s linen pastel and charcoal drawing “Mutable Sun” (2025), depicting a jaguar and Ixchel, the Maya goddess of the moon. On either side are vibrant, futuristic masks by Carlos Luna James, who lives in Ciudad Juárez, on the United States-Mexico border. Colombian artist Dario Ortiz updates traditional stories in his meticulously painted canvases, portraying mythological figures as contemporary border crossers making their way along the riverbank.Works by Johnny Lopez near selections from the Pangue International Video Art FestivalVerse Gallery has brought artists primarily from Colombia and Ecuador, including Johnny Lopez, whose slick resin sculptures mix Indigenous and European motifs with elements of pop culture and street art. Ecuadorian artist Maca Viva slyly challenges male power icons with her uncanny paintings of furry crowns. Colombian artist Alejandro Sanchez’s sculptures are composed of miniature storage containers, sparking a playful dialogue with Minimalist aesthetics.Works by Maquiamelo (left) and Maca Viva (right) at the booth of Verse Gallery Caichiolo also curated the fair’s non-commercial section, DIVERSEartLA, which is centered around the theme of biennials this year. She tapped several curators to select work from the Casablanca Biennial (Morocco), Gwangju Biennial (Korea), and the World Textile Art Biennial (Miami), among other recent exhibitions. The highlight is a mini-retrospective of biennials that have featured the work of artist Marcos Ramírez, who goes by ERRE, curated by Alma Ruiz. A cross-border artist who operates between Tijuana and San Diego, ERRE has long engaged with issues of Latine identity, immigration, and nationalism, with provocative works like his monumental \"Toy-an Horse\" (1997), placed at the dividing line between Mexico and the US. Artist Marcos Ramirez (ERRE) with his work \"Democracy\" (2000)His major installation “187 Pairs of Hands” (1996–97), represented here by a small section, consists of 187 photographs of people performing various examples of manual labor, accompanied by information about each subject. The work was a response to California Proposition 187, an anti-immigration ballot initiative that excluded undocumented immigrants from receiving public services such as education and healthcare. “They tried to suppress us, surround us, and cage the workers, but everybody's still working, right now,” ERRE said, noting the connection between the bill and current ICE raids. “How can you stop a waterfall? You can't. You need to freeze the whole river.” The artist’s works feel especially urgent in the wake of the brutal killing of Renee Nicole Macklin Good by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis just days ago.In addition to these focused presentations, this year’s fair features an international roster of over 90 exhibitors, including Epicentrum Gallery from Poland and Paris with prints by Picasso, Chagall, and Dali; London’s Rebecca Hossack Gallery with collaged paintings by Spanish artist Mersuka Dopazo; and motorcycle-inspired paintings by Clash bassist Paul Simonon at John Martin Gallery’s booth. There’s something for everyone, so if you've heard the LA Art Show is unhip in comparison to next month’s fairs, it might just be worth a trip over this weekend to see for yourself.

    "body": "\n            South Africa has scrapped a performance mourning victims of Israel's genocide in Gaza that was selected for the country's 2026 Venice Biennale pavilion. In a statement to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for the nation's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture said the pavilion “should not be used to amplify similarly divisive global disputes that do not center South Africa’s own story,” adding: “We need to use our platforms to sell our country to the world.”Artist Gabrielle Goliath and curator Ingrid Masondo's proposal for the South African presentation, titled Elegy after Goliath's decade-long vocal performance series, had been chosen for the Biennale by an independent committee in December. According to reporting by the South African publication Daily Maverick, the decision to reject the artwork originated from the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture's minister, Gayton McKenzie, the founder of the right-wing Patriotic Alliance party. Goliath's pavilion performance would have addressed the \"unfolding crisis of displacement and death in Gaza,\" according to a representative of her studio, reached via email by Hyperallergic. The performance was also expected to address the Israeli military's killing of the Palestinian poet Hiba Abu Nada, the femicide in South Africa, and the Herero and Nama genocide perpetuated by Germans in Namibia in the early 20th century. However, according to the Daily Maverick, McKenzie took issue with the proposal's content regarding Israel and Gaza, writing in an internal letter in December that the subject was \"highly divisive in nature and relates to an ongoing international conflict that is widely polarising.” He then reportedly threatened to withdraw South Africa from the international art event if the work was not removed, a move decried by the country's pavilion selection committee as unconstitutional. In a January 8 open letter, the members of the appointed Biennale selection committee defended their decision to accept Elegy.\"We affirm our continued and unequivocal support for the artist, the curator, and their project in the face of political pressure and attempts to silence free expression and compromise artistic integrity,\" reads the statement, signed by Greer Valley, Molemo Moiloa, Nomusa Makhubu, Sean O’Toole, and Tumelo Mosaka.“We further reject all forms of censorship and intimidation that seek to curtail critical artistic practice or undermine the autonomy of cultural production,” the letter continues. The group characterized Elegy as concerning “intimacy, care, and listening, [and] creating space for reflection on loss and remembrance.\"Organizers of the country's pavilion were reportedly notified of McKenzie's request to remove the performance series on January 2. The South African government had appointed the organization Art Periodic to lead the fundraising and production of the pavilion; however, the nonprofit said in a statement that it no longer \"holds a mandate to proceed with the project.\" Art Periodic had appointed the selection committee that chose Elegy.South Africa Friends of Israel posted a video on Facebook that apparently shows McKenzie rejecting that a genocide was unfolding in Gaza, a claim that contradicts the official characterization of the United Nations and several human rights groups. He also vowed to \"stop the ICJ case,\" likely referring to South Africa's genocide charge against Israel in the United Nations' International Court of Justice, if he were to become president. (Hyperallergic has not independently verified the video clip.)In an email statement sent to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture rejected the allegations of censorship and stated that McKenzie wished for the pavilion not to become a “proxy arena for geopolitical conflicts.\"\"His concern relates solely to the fact that South Africa is currently the subject of highly contested and politically charged narratives internationally, including being falsely labelled a 'genocidal state,'\" the spokesperson said, possibly referring to comparisons between Israel and Apartheid-era South Africa.The spokesperson also claimed that a \"foreign country was funding or partly funding this exhibition,\" but did not immediately clarify which nation they were referring to. Goliath and Masondo have appealed the decision to the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation, the artist's studio told Hyperallergic in an email.According to the Maverick, communications from McKenzie suggested he would favor works for the pavilion that portray South Africa more positively. The United States Department of State issued a similar nationalistic requirement for its pavilion proposal guidelines last year. “I have said it many times: my work is not about violence, but rather foregrounds practices of mourning, survival, and repair, within and despite this normative disregard,\" Goliath told the Maverick. \"At a moment in which sustaining hope is a political imperative, I think it is all the more crucial to emphasise my work as life-work rather than death-work, and as rooted in a decolonial black feminist project of care and radical love.”The spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture said the nation will still participate in the upcoming Venice Biennale, but that the department had retained control of “administration and curation.”Hyperallergic has contacted Art Periodic and the Venice Biennale for comment. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        South Africa\n                      \n                      \n                        Venice Biennale\n                      \n                  \n        ",

She constructed “Early Earth,” the setting of two of her graphic novels, The Encyclopedia of Early Earth (2013) and The One Hundred Nights of Hero (2016). The former is a collection of creation myths for Early Earth, while the other is modeled on One Thousand and One Nights and its frame story of a woman delaying a man’s predation by distracting him with storytelling. The latter book has been adapted into a feature film, 100 Nights of Hero, which faithfully translates the book’s feminist commentary while disappointingly deemphasizing its more complex narrative techniques.Greenberg sets her book in a region of Early Earth characterized by stifling gender-based oppression, a country where women are forbidden to read or write and can be executed on the whims of their husbands. Young noblewoman Cherry (played in the film by Maika Monroe) learns that her husband has wagered with his friend Manfred (Nicholas Galitzine) that she can resist the latter’s seduction for 100 nights. To rebuff Manfred, who makes it clear that he won’t take “no” for an answer, Cherry’s maid and secret lover, Hero (Emma Corrin), employs the Scheherazade gambit, occupying him with stories each evening until he falls asleep. Nicholas Galitzine and Maika Monroe in Julia Jackman’s 100 Nights of Hero (courtesy Matthew Towers, an Independent Film Company Release)As the book relates a variety of these stories, mixing folklore and myth, their connections to Hero’s past eventually become clear. The film has just one story within the larger one, a tale of three sisters (distractingly, one is played by Charli xcx) who cause a scandal when their literacy is revealed. Instead of an interwoven anthology, the movie cuts back and forth between the two threads. That simplification, likely employed to streamline the production, weakens Greenberg’s overarching investigation into how storytelling and coded meanings can subvert oppression. It is also just odd that the characters continually attest to how vital it is that women tell each other their own stories when none of those stories are actually accessible to the audience. Felicity Jones, Emma Corrin, and Maika Monroe in Julia Jackman’s 100 Nights of Hero (courtesy Jed Knight, an Independent Film Company Release)However, while her script lacks the book’s mythic bent, director and co-screenwriter (with Greenberg) Julia Jackman does evoke that quality in the film’s visual sensibility. Recalling films like Tarsem Singh’s 2006 adventure fantasy The Fall or the works of Wes Anderson, she incorporates the tropes of an illustrated storybook into the aesthetic, through the sumptuous set and costume design and by coaxing heightened, mannered performances from her actors. This is a film of rich and contrasting colors — Cherry’s white clothing pointedly emphasizing how she remains undefiled by the male touch, Manfred’s sinister all-black attire, the three sisters in idyllic greens and blues. In some respects, the movie seems crafted specifically to be released as clips on social media sites — for better or worse, our contemporary mode of sharing folktales. It is most striking in moments that lend themselves to clips, like a jarringly violent scene of Manfred proudly holding up the carcass of a deer he’s slaughtered. Shots often put characters or actions dead center in the screen, accommodating the cropping needed to make widescreen imagery legible in portrait mode on social feeds. It remains to be seen whether the film will catch on like the stories within it in Early Earth. But I’d suggest starting by sharing the graphic novel.100 Nights of Hero is now streaming.\n                  \n                      \n                        Film Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        100 Nights of Hero\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n\tin Food & Drink, History |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nHere’s anoth­er thing you can cred­it Thomas Jef­fer­son with: being the first known Amer­i­can to record an ice cream recipe. It’s one of 10 sur­viv­ing recipes writ­ten by the found­ing father.\nAccord­ing to Monticello.org, ice cream began appear­ing “in French cook­books start­ing in the late 17th cen­tu­ry, and in Eng­lish-lan­guage cook­books in the ear­ly 18th cen­tu­ry.” And there “are accounts of ice cream being served in the Amer­i­can colonies as ear­ly as 1744.” Jef­fer­son like­ly tast­ed his fair share of the dessert while liv­ing in France (1784–1789), and it con­tin­ued to be served at Mon­ti­cel­lo upon his return to Vir­ginia. By the first decade of the 19th cen­tu­ry, ice cream became increas­ing­ly com­mon in cook­books pub­lished through­out the U.S.\nYou can see the entire recipe for Jef­fer­son­’s vanil­la ice cream here, and read a tran­script below.\n2. bot­tles of good cream.\n6. yolks of eggs.\n1/2 lb. sug­ar\nmix the yolks & sug­ar\nput the cream on a fire in a casse­role, first putting in a stick of Vanil­la.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off & pour it gen­tly into the mix­ture of eggs & sug­ar.\nstir it well.\nput it on the fire again stir­ring it thor­ough­ly with a spoon to pre­vent it’s stick­ing to the casse­role.\nwhen near boil­ing take it off and strain it thro’ a tow­el.\nput it in the Sabottiere[12]\nthen set it in ice an hour before it is to be served. put into the ice a hand­ful of salt.\nput salt on the cov­er­lid of the Sabotiere & cov­er the whole with ice.\nleave it still half a quar­ter of an hour.\nthen turn the Sabot­tiere in the ice 10 min­utes\nopen it to loosen with a spat­u­la the ice from the inner sides of the Sabotiere.\nshut it & replace it in the ice\nopen it from time to time to detach the ice from the sides\nwhen well tak­en (prise) stir it well with the Spat­u­la.\nput it in moulds, justling it well down on the knee.\nthen put the mould into the same buck­et of ice.\nleave it there to the moment of serv­ing it.\nto with­draw it, immerse the mould in warm water, turn­ing it well till it will come out & turn it into a plate\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2014.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nThe First Amer­i­can Cook­book: Sam­ple Recipes from Amer­i­can Cook­ery (1796)\nLeo Tolstoy’s Fam­i­ly Recipe for Mac and Cheese\nErnest Hemingway’s Favorite Ham­burg­er Recipe\nThe Recipes of Icon­ic Authors: Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath, Roald Dahl, the Mar­quis de Sade & More\nMoMA’s Artists’ Cook­book (1978) Reveals the Meals of Sal­vador Dalí, Willem de Koon­ing, Andy Warhol, Louise Bour­geois & More\nDavid Lynch Teach­es You to Cook His Quinoa Recipe in a Strange, Sur­re­al­ist Video\nHow to Actu­al­ly Cook Sal­vador Dali’s Sur­re­al­ist Recipes: Cray­fish, Prawns, and Spit­ted Eggs\n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\tin Art, History |   \tFebruary 24th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIn ancient Egypt, writ­ing hiero­glyphs was a high­ly spe­cial­ized skill, one com­mand­ed by only a small frac­tion of the pop­u­la­tion. The fact that there were more than 1,000 char­ac­ters to mem­o­rize prob­a­bly had some­thing to do with that, but the vari­ety of sur­faces on which hiero­glyphs were writ­ten could­n’t have made it any eas­i­er. Depend­ing on the occa­sion, ancient Egyp­tians used papyrus, wood, met­al, and pot­tery shards as writ­ing sur­faces. The most mon­u­men­tal or reli­gious­ly impor­tant texts, how­ev­er, got carved into stone, thus ensur­ing the words a kind of eter­nal life — a par­tic­u­lar con­cern in the cas­es of tomb walls and sar­copha­gi.\nThere may be lit­tle call to write hiero­glyphs today, but the tech­niques to do so haven’t been lost. In the new video above from the Vic­to­ria and Albert Muse­um, sculp­tor and stone carv­er Miri­am John­son demon­strates how to carve into stone the name of Pharaoh Khu­fu, who built the Great Pyra­mid (and indeed, was buried in it).\nThe first step is to write that name, sur­round­ed by its car­touche, on a sheet of car­bon paper. This isn’t the brush and ink that the ancient Egyp­tians would have used, grant­ed, but for the rest of the project, John­son sticks to the old-fash­ioned ways. With the image trans­ferred, and using noth­ing more than a mal­let and a chis­el, she carves the hiero­glyphs into the stone not just once but twice.\nThe first time, John­son carves in “sunken relief,” a tech­nique that involves cut­ting the image out of the sur­face of the stone. The sec­ond time, she ren­ders Pharaoh Khu­fu’s name in “raised relief,” which requires cut­ting out every­thing but the image, cre­at­ing the effect of the hiero­glyphs ris­ing out of the stone. With the for­mer “you see more of the shad­ows”; with the lat­ter, “you’ve got more oppor­tu­ni­ty of putting more tex­ture into the char­ac­ters.” Seen in a state of com­ple­tion — by a lay­man, at least — John­son’s carv­ings would­n’t look out of place in a muse­um exhib­it on ancient Egypt. Even if tools man­u­fac­tured in the twen­ty-first cen­tu­ry pro­duce a few sub­tle dif­fer­ences from the real thing, give these stones a mil­len­ni­um or two to age, and they’ll sure­ly look even more con­vinc­ing.\nvia Kot­tke\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow to Read Ancient Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs: A British Muse­um Cura­tor Explains\nAn Ani­mat­ed Intro­duc­tion to the Roset­ta Stone, and How It Unlocked Our Under­stand­ing of Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs\nWhat Ancient Egypt­ian Sound­ed Like & How We Know It\n3,200-Year-Old Egypt­ian Tablet Records Excus­es for Why Peo­ple Missed Work: “The Scor­pi­on Bit Him,” “Brew­ing Beer” & More\nYou Could Soon Be Able to Text with 2,000 Ancient Egypt­ian Hiero­glyphs\nWatch a Mas­ter­piece Emerge from a Sol­id Block of Stone\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Art, Books |   \tFebruary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nImag­ine you could talk to Hierony­mus Bosch, the authors of the Book of Rev­e­la­tion, or of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script—a bizarre 15th cen­tu­ry text writ­ten in an uncrack­able code; that you could solve cen­turies-old mys­ter­ies by ask­ing them, “what were you think­ing?” You might be dis­ap­point­ed to hear them say, as does Lui­gi Ser­afi­ni, author and illus­tra­tor of the Codex Seraphini­anus, “At the end of the day [it’s] sim­i­lar to the Rorschach inkblot test. You see what you want to see. You might think it’s speak­ing to you, but it’s just your imag­i­na­tion.”\nIf you were a long­time devo­tee of an intense­ly sym­bol­ic, myth­ic text, you might refuse to believe this. It must mean some­thing, fans of the Codex have insist­ed since the book’s appear­ance in 1981.\nIt shares many sim­i­lar­i­ties with the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, save its rel­a­tive­ly recent vin­tage and liv­ing author: both the Seraphini­anus and the Voyn­ich seem to be com­pendi­ums of an oth­er­world­ly nat­ur­al sci­ence and art, and both are writ­ten in a whol­ly invent­ed lan­guage.\n\nSer­afi­ni tells Wired he thinks Voyn­ich is a fake. “The Holy Roman Emper­or Rudolf II loved ancient man­u­scripts; some­body swin­dled him and spread the rumor that it was orig­i­nal. The idea of made-up lan­guages is not new at all.” As for his own made-up lan­guage in the Codex, he avers, “I always said that there is no mean­ing behind the script; it’s just a game.” But it is not a hoax. Though he hasn’t mind­ed the mon­ey from the book’s cult pop­u­lar­i­ty, he cre­at­ed the book, he says, “try­ing to reach out to my fel­low peo­ple, just like blog­gers do.” It is, he says, “the prod­uct of a gen­er­a­tion that chose to con­nect and cre­ate a net­work, rather than kill each oth­er in wars like their fathers did.”\n\n\n\t\n\nThe Codex, writes Abe Books, who made the short video review above, is “essen­tial­ly an ency­clo­pe­dia about an alien world that clear­ly reflects our own, each chap­ter appears to deal with key facets of this sur­re­al place, includ­ing flo­ra, fau­na, sci­ence, machines, games and archi­tec­ture.” That’s only a guess giv­en the unin­tel­li­gi­ble lan­guage.\nThe illus­tra­tions seem to draw from Bosch, Leonar­do da Vin­ci, and the medieval trav­el­ogue as much as from the sur­re­al­ism of con­tem­po­rary Euro­pean artists like Fan­tas­tic Plan­et ani­ma­tor René Laloux.\n\nSer­afi­ni has been delight­ed to see an exten­sive inter­net com­mu­ni­ty coa­lesce around the book, and has had his fun with it. He “now states,” writes Dan­ger­ous Minds, “that a stray white cat that joined him while he cre­at­ed the Codex in Rome in the 1970s was actu­al­ly the real author, tele­path­i­cal­ly guid­ing Ser­afi­ni as he drew and ‘wrote.’” You can now, thanks to a recent, rel­a­tive­ly afford­able edi­tion pub­lished by Riz­zoli, pur­chase your copy of the Codex. Buy now, I’d say. First edi­tions of the book now fetch upwards of $6000, and its pop­u­lar­i­ty shows no sign of slow­ing.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2017.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:  \nA Dig­i­tal Archive of Hierony­mus Bosch’s Com­plete Works: Zoom In & Explore His Sur­re­al Art\nExplore a Dig­i­tized Edi­tion of the Voyn­ich Man­u­script, “the World’s Most Mys­te­ri­ous Book”\nCarl Jung’s Hand-Drawn, Rarely-Seen Man­u­script The Red Book\nThe Foot-Lick­ing Demons & Oth­er Strange Things in a 1921 Illus­trat­ed Man­u­script from Iran\nJosh Jones is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC. \n\t\t\n        \t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nDubbed the “vine that ate the South,” the infamous kudzu plant has a reputation. The fast-multiplying, invasive arrowroot was brought to North America in the 19th century and promoted to ease erosion, although the hot, muggy climate of the Southern U.S. proved too accommodating. For decades, kudzu has spread at a rapid speed, swallowing up roadsides, infrastructure, and really anything in its path. Its seemingly insatiable growth has vaulted the perennial plant to mythic status in Southern ecology, conservation, and culture.\nAs a child in Birmingham, Joyce Lin was accustomed to the vine, although as an adult, she’s found that it’s difficult to disentangle kudzu’s reputation and tangible influence. “It is loathed for shading out the native flora, but its impact is often overstated,” she says. “While it visibly thrives along roadsides where there is a lot of sun, kudzu is unable to penetrate deeply into forests.”\n“Kudzu Chair” (2025), wood, kudzu vine, epoxy, cloth, wire, and paint\nThis complicated legacy inspired a body of work that melds vernacular furniture with the plant. Kudzu Series comprises four sculptures that wouldn’t be out of place on an abandoned Southern farm. A found metal floorlamp cracks in two, wrapping the leafy plant around a bulb like a lopsided shade. The vines also climb up a wooden ladder, their sinuous roots mimicking the steps of the lower rungs.\nLin is interested in the relationship between reality and fantasy, particularly as she transforms synthetic materials into uncanny knotted bark and concentric growth rings in the shape of a chair. Kudzu Series is no different. While she foraged the thick vines from areas near her home in Houston, the artificial leaves emerged from a laborious process. \nCiting the techniques of Michael Anderson, who made models for Yale’s Peabody Museum before retiring, Lin made plaster and silicone press molds. “My method uses wires sandwiched between dyed shop towels and tissue paper soaked in five-minute epoxy. I painstakingly painted in the veins and details on each leaf. Imperfections of the casts ultimately turned into brown spots and bug holes,” she says. Creating seamless transitions from wood to vine with epoxy clay and utilizing inner armatures adds to the surreal qualities of the works, as the plant appears to sprout directly from the industrial material. Torching, vinegar, and steel wool weathered areas that were too pristine. \nPerched on a few leaves are a handful of kudzu bugs, rotund insects that arrived in the U.S. in the aughts and have decimated the vines. “The chair has approximately 332 leaves and one bug, the table has 101 leaves and three bugs, the floor lamp has 162 leaves and two bugs, and the ladder has 117 leaves and one bug, which in total took me a little over a year to make,” the artist says.\nDetail of “Kudzu Chair” (2025). Photo by Logan Jackson\nFor Lin, this body of work is a sort of metaphor for persistence and resilience. She adds: \n\nIt arrived as an outsider, yet it has become an icon of the South, appearing in art, music, and literature. It outcompetes species, yet its flexibility and resilience make it uniquely suited to survive a changing climate. Its roots are edible, its vines are weavable, its fibers can be used to make cloth and paper, and it has been used in East Asian medicine for centuries. \n\nLin is currently teaching at the Rhode Island School of Design and will spend the summer in Philadelphia for the Windgate Arts Residency Program.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nConsidering Alex Hutton’s fascination with rollercoasters and monumental waterslides, he doesn’t actually ever climb aboard. “Heights and the sinking feeling during free-fall bother me too much to enjoy them,” he tells Colossal. In a way, that adds even further dimension to the enigmatic, unpeopled atmosphere of his meticulous oil paintings, which focus on rollercoasters, waterslides, and intricately contrived frameworks.\nDevoid of the cars that roll along the tracks, Hutton focuses exclusively on volume, line, and three-dimensional grids, also typically setting the undulating forms against blank or brushy backgrounds so that even their scale is disorienting. While we typically associate the rides with youthful energy and nostalgia, the structures are strangely still and stark when pared down to their pure engineering.\n“Weft” (2025), oil on linen, 27 x 37 inches\n“There is an absurdity to many theme park rides like rollercoasters and waterslides that I find compelling,” Hutton tells Colossal, continuing:\n\nThey present a mixture of excitement and fear. They show graceful yet imposing movement through space with curves, rhythm, and color at a striking scale. So much material, time, engineering, and maintenance goes into a short ride designed to fling people through space and create a sense of thrill and danger in a controlled environment.\n\nHutton views these paintings as a natural offshoot of PC games he used to play in the early 2000s, such as Sim City and Rollercoaster Tycoon, where the aesthetics of world-building—especially from a bird’s-eye view—captivated his imagination. His rollercoasters and waterslides are extensions of a practice that incorporates subjects like boardwalks, bridges, landscapes, structural framing, and even prehistoric anatomy.\nMany of the coasters and slides are based on real constructions. The form for “Foment,” for example, is based on a waterslide in Kobe, Japan, called the Super Whooper. It was demolished in 1995 following a huge earthquake. “Roil” comes from an existing waterpark in Qatar called Meryal, which is home to the world’s largest waterslide structure. “It is hard to believe that some of these structures were ever built,” Hutton says. “I try to capture that absurdity and audacity of their existence.”\n“Warp” (2025), oil on linen, 26 x 33 inches\nIt’s less important to the artist that the paintings represent recognizable places than to depict formal qualities. Movement and proportion are just a couple of things he considers when planning a composition. “I look for a rhythm, a structure, a combination of colors that is exciting enough to spend time with,” Hutton says. “I want to find something unlikely, something reconsidered in a new light or from a new angle, but those moments can be difficult to track down.”\nThe two untitled works pictured here are bound for an exhibition at Main Projects in Richmond, Virginia, which opens on April 30. And he’s currently working toward a solo exhibition at SHRINE in New York, slated for next year.

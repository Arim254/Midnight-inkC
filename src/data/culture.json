    "body": "\n\tin Film, Technology |   \tJanuary 19th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nWhen Net­flix launched around the turn of the mil­len­ni­um, it was received as a god­send by many Amer­i­can cinephiles, espe­cial­ly those who lived nowhere near diverse­ly pro­grammed revival hous­es or well-curat­ed video stores. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry lat­er, it’s safe to say that those days have come to an end. Not only does the stream­ing-only Net­flix of the twen­ty-twen­ties no longer trans­mit movies on DVD through the mail (a ser­vice its younger users have trou­ble even imag­in­ing), it ranks approx­i­mate­ly nowhere as a pre­ferred cinephile des­ti­na­tion. That has to do with a selec­tion much dimin­ished since the DVD days — espe­cial­ly as regards movies more than a decade or so old — but also with a brand debased by too many bland, for­mu­la­ic orig­i­nal pro­duc­tions.\nUnlike the plat­for­m’s var­i­ous acclaimed mul­ti-episode dra­mat­ic series, the “Net­flix movie” com­mands no crit­i­cal respect. But it can, at least if you trust the com­pa­ny’s own view­er­ship data, com­mand a large audi­ence, if not an espe­cial­ly atten­tive one. The gen­er­al semi-engage­ment of Net­flix view­ers, as argued in the Nerd­stal­gic video at the top of the post, is reflect­ed in the qual­i­ty of the “movie-shaped prod­uct” now served to them. \nFar from the slapped-togeth­er approx­i­ma­tions of Hol­ly­wood we once expect­ed from films made for TV, the stream-chart-top­ping likes of Red Notice and The Elec­tric State are mega-bud­get­ed pro­duc­tions brim­ming with big stars and large-scale visu­al effects. They’re also tis­sues of algo­rithm-approved nar­ra­tive ele­ments, bor­rowed imagery, and third-hand quips, all of them for­got­ten as soon as the next piece of con­tent begins auto-play­ing.\n\n\n\t\n\nOn the lat­est Joe Rogan Expe­ri­ence pod­cast, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon turned up to pro­mote their own Net­flix movie, The Rip. They don’t take long to open up about the dis­tinc­tive chal­lenges of work­ing for that plat­form in this era. Damon men­tions that, where­as action movies once saved their explo­sion-inten­sive set pieces for after the sto­ry gets in motion, Net­flix asks, “Can we get a big one in the first five min­utes? We want peo­ple to stay tuned in. And it wouldn’t be ter­ri­ble if you reit­er­at­ed the plot three or four times in the dia­logue because peo­ple are on their phones while they’re watch­ing.” Accord­ing to the film­mak­ers who speak about it, the needs of these so-called “sec­ond screen” view­ers have assumed great impor­tance in the stu­dio notes offered by Net­flix — which has, at this point, become a major stu­dio in itself.\n\n\n\t\n\nSat­is­fy­ing the appar­ent demands of Net­flix’s met­rics results in what Nerd­stal­gic calls “visu­al muzak,” geared to hold out just enough famil­iar­i­ty and pres­tige to get users to press play, with­out ever call­ing so much atten­tion to itself that they press stop. This makes the stu­dio pic­tures of the nineties, when Affleck and Damon broke out, look like the stuff of a gold­en age. “There were a lot of real­ly good inde­pen­dent movies that were being made,” Damon remem­bers. “They were mak­ing dar­ing movies, and every­one just got way more con­ser­v­a­tive.” On one lev­el, stream­ing plat­forms have great­ly widened access to film in gen­er­al; on anoth­er, they’ve sti­fled artis­tic indi­vid­u­al­i­ty and risk-tak­ing on the part of actu­al films. As Quentin Taran­ti­no has point­ed out, tech­nol­o­gy and eco­nom­ics put main­stream cin­e­ma into peri­ods of cre­ative retrench­ment every so often: the fifties, for exam­ple, or the eight­ies. Whether anoth­er sev­en­ties or nineties lies ahead, today’s cinephiles can only hope.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWho Is Killing Cin­e­ma?: A Mur­der Mys­tery Iden­ti­fies the Cul­tur­al & Eco­nom­ic Cul­prits\nWhy Movies Don’t Feel Like Movies Any­more: The Rise of Meta­mod­ernist Films, and How They Grew Out of Mod­ernism & Post­mod­ernism\nHow the “Mar­veliza­tion” of Cin­e­ma Accel­er­ates the Decline of Film­mak­ing\nThe Decay of Cin­e­ma: Susan Son­tag, Mar­tin Scors­ese & Their Lamen­ta­tions on the Decline of Cin­e­ma Explored in a New Video Essay\nWhy We All Need Sub­ti­tles Now\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nI have tak­en more out of alco­hol than alco­hol has tak­en out of me. — Win­ston Churchill\nWin­ston Churchill had a rep­u­ta­tion as a bril­liant states­man and a prodi­gious drinker.\nThe for­mer prime min­is­ter imbibed through­out the day, every day.  He also burned through 10 dai­ly cig­ars, and lived to the ripe old age of 90.\nHis come­back to Field Mar­shal Bernard Mont­gomery’s boast that he nei­ther smoked nor drank, and was 100 per­cent fit was “I drink and smoke, and I am 200 per­cent fit.”\nFirst Lady Eleanor Roo­sevelt mar­veled “that any­one could smoke so much and drink so much and keep per­fect­ly well.”\nIn No More Cham­pagne: Churchill and His Mon­ey, author David Lough doc­u­ments Churchill’s dis­as­trous alco­hol expens­es, as well as the bot­tle count at Chartwell, his Ken­tish res­i­dence. Here’s the tal­ly for March 24,1937:\n180 bot­tles and 30 half bot­tles of Pol Roger cham­pagne\n20 bot­tles and 9 half bot­tles of oth­er cham­pagne\n100+ bot­tles of claret\n117 bot­tles and 389 half bot­tles of Barsac\n13 bot­tles of brandy\n5 bot­tles of cham­pagne brandy\n7 bot­tles of liqueur whisky\n\nAll that liquor was not going to drink itself.\nDid Churchill have a hol­low leg?  An extra­or­di­nar­i­ly high tol­er­ance? An uncan­ny abil­i­ty to mask his intox­i­ca­tion?\nWhiskey som­me­li­er Rex Williams, a founder of the Whiskey Tribe YouTube chan­nel, and pod­cast host Andrew Heaton endeav­or to find out, above, by ded­i­cat­ing a day to the British Bulldog’s drink­ing reg­i­men.\nThey’re not the first to under­take such a fol­ly.\nThe Dai­ly Telegraph’s Har­ry Wal­lop doc­u­ment­ed a sim­i­lar adven­ture in 2015, wind­ing up queasy, and to judge by his 200 spelling mis­takes, cog­ni­tive­ly impaired.\nWilliams and Heaton’s on-cam­era exper­i­ment achieves a Drunk His­to­ry vibe and tell­tale flushed cheeks.\nHere’s the drill, not that we advise try­ing it at home:\nBREAKFAST\nAn eye open­er of John­nie Walk­er Red — just a splash — mixed with soda water to the rim.\nFol­low with more of the same through­out the morn­ing.\nThis is how Churchill, who often con­duct­ed his morn­ing busi­ness abed in a dress­ing gown, man­aged to aver­age between 1 — 3 ounces of alco­hol before lunch.\nAppar­ent­ly he devel­oped a taste for it as a young sol­dier post­ed in what is now Pak­istan, when Scotch not only improved the fla­vor of plain water, ‘once one got the knack of it, the very repul­sion from the fla­vor devel­oped an attrac­tion of its own.”\nAfter a morn­ing spent sip­ping the stuff, Heaton reports feel­ing “play­ful and jokey, but not yet vio­lent.”\nLUNCH\nTime for “an ambi­tious quo­ta of cham­pagne!”\nChurchill’s pre­ferred brand was Pol Roger, though he wasn’t averse to Giesler, Moet et Chan­don, or Pom­mery,  pur­chased from the upscale wine and spir­its mer­chant Ran­dolph Payne & Sons,  whose let­ter­head iden­ti­fied them as sup­pli­ers to “Her Majesty The Late Queen Vic­to­ria and to The Late King William The Fourth.”\nChurchill enjoyed his impe­r­i­al pint of cham­pagne from a sil­ver tankard, like a “prop­er Edwar­dian gent” accord­ing to his life­long friend, Odette Pol-Roger.\nWilliams and Heaton take theirs in flutes accom­pa­nied by fish sticks from the freez­er case. This is the point beyond which a hang­over is all but assured.\nLunch con­cludes with a post-pran­di­al cognac, to set­tle the stom­ach and begin the diges­tion process.\nChurchill, who declared him­self a man of sim­ple tastes — I am eas­i­ly sat­is­fied with the best — would have insist­ed on some­thing from the house of Hine.\nRESTORATIVE  AFTERNOON NAP\nThis seems to be a crit­i­cal ele­ment of Churchill’s alco­hol man­age­ment suc­cess. He fre­quent­ly allowed him­self as much as 90 min­utes to clear the cob­webs.\nA nap def­i­nite­ly pulls our re-enac­tors out of their tail spins. Heaton emerges ready to “bluff (his) way through a meet­ing.”\nTEATIME\nI guess we can call it that, giv­en the tim­ing.\nNo tea though.\nJust a steady stream of extreme­ly weak scotch and sodas to take the edge off of admin­is­tra­tive tasks.\nDINNER\nMore cham­pagne!!! More cognac!!!\n“This should be the apex of our wit,” a bleary Heaton tells his belch­ing com­pan­ion, who fess­es up to vom­it­ing upon wak­ing the next day.\nTheir con­clu­sion? Churchill’s reg­i­men is unmanageable…at least for them.\nAnd pos­si­bly also for Churchill.\nAs fel­low Scotch enthu­si­ast Christo­pher Hitchens revealed in a 2002 arti­cle in The Atlantic, some of Churchill’s most famous radio broad­casts, includ­ing his famous pledge to “fight on the beach­es” after the Mir­a­cle of Dunkirk, were voiced by a pinch hit­ter:\nNor­man Shel­ley, who played Win­nie-the-Pooh for the BBC’s Children’s Hour, ven­tril­o­quized Churchill for his­to­ry and fooled mil­lions of lis­ten­ers. Per­haps Churchill was too much inca­pac­i­tat­ed by drink to deliv­er the speech­es him­self.\nOr per­haps the great man mere­ly felt he’d earned the right to unwind with a glass of Graham’s Vin­tage Char­ac­ter Port, a Fine Old Amon­til­la­do Sher­ry or a Fine Old Liquor brandy, as was his wont.\nNote: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2022.\nRelat­ed Con­tent \nWin­ston Churchill Gets a Doctor’s Note to Drink Unlim­it­ed Alco­hol While Vis­it­ing the U.S. Dur­ing Pro­hi­bi­tion (1932)\nWin­ston Churchill’s Paint­ings: Great States­man, Sur­pris­ing­ly Good Artist\nOh My God!

Born in Santiago, Chile, in 1943, Rosenfeld came of age under conditions that made such interference urgent. Her most iconic action, “Una milla de cruces sobre el pavimento\" (One Mile of Crosses on the Pavement, 1979), was first carried out on Avenida Manquehue across the presidential palace in the early years of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. She attached white tape and bandages onto dashed traffic lines, transforming them into a trail of accumulated crosses. Grainy black-and-white footage follows Rosenfeld's slow processional march, her body bending forward to inscribe a disobedient line. The marks read sequentially as a tally — one that adds up the dead, the disappeared, the state’s sanctioned silences. But it is also an improbable insistence that something additive and charged with possibility might still emerge from the negative. Rosenfeld repeated the action throughout the 1980s and beyond, from the Atacama Desert (March 1981) to outside the White House in Washington, DC (June 1982), letting the line migrate across sociopolitical contexts while retaining its unruly charge.Installation view of Lotty Rosenfeld, \"I - +\" (1987), video with color and sound. 14 min. 51 sec.The line that is made to misbehave shows up across many works, like in the video “I - +” (1987), in which a horizontal band plays footage of her street crossings, slicing through a vertical column of state-controlled broadcast — including Pinochet rallies and Reagan-era posturing — to form a luminous cross. On a small TV monitor, the split screen reads as a quiet hijacking of the state’s visual field, punctuated by the intermittent scroll of the phrase “Esta línea es mi arma” (This line is my weapon), a caption that names Rosenfeld’s register of breach.Disobedient Spaces emphasizes the networks of exchange and mutual support that shaped Rosenfeld’s practice. Moments when Rosenfeld worked alongside Cecilia Vicuña and writer Diamela Eltit situate her within a network where activism and poetry were mutually sustaining. Archival posters, pamphlets, and correspondence document Rosenfeld’s work as a founding member of Colectivo Acciones de Arte (CADA), including \"Para no morir de hambre en el arte\" (How not to die of hunger in art, 1979), when the group redistributed bags of milk in low-income neighborhoods of Santiago. Milk carried particular weight in Chilean public life. It was central to Allende’s nutrition programs, and under Pinochet’s dictatorship, it transformed into a marker of scarcity and a symbol of the rapid dismantling of social welfare. Left: CADA, \"Bolsa de leche vacía con intervención\" (1979/2025), photograph; right: CADA, \"Bolsa de leche vacía con intervención\" (1979/2025), photographCADA coordinated further actions across the city, from a procession of milk trucks to full-page newspaper ads and interventions at cultural institutions, eventually sealing 100 milk bags and a manifesto inside an acrylic box, to be reopened only when the public regained access to their unmet basic needs. The title “How not to die of hunger in art” might read at first as a familiar problem of artists’ precarity, but it signals that survival under authoritarian rule requires both sustenance and nerve — both something to live on and something to stand for.For CADA, that meant refusing to let artistic discourse remain insulated from the social urgencies surrounding it and instead moving directly into the street — inviting participation, unsettling routines, and demanding visibility. This is most clearly seen in the national spread of the NO+ (“No more”) campaign, a slogan designed to be completed by citizens with their own demands and circulated across Chile through collective use. The exhibition echoes this distributive spirit by offering reprinted flyers and small NO+ pin — objects that demonstrate how the work gained force by being passed hand to hand.Across these works, what emerges most forcefully is that Rosenfeld’s resistance was never simply oppositional, but built on collective methods. Her actions slipped past the state’s mechanisms of control, carving out fissures where dissent could take root, and making visible how disobedience often begins with the smallest breach: the refusal to let a line point only in one direction.Left: CADA, \"1/2 litre leche envelope (Para no morir)\" (1979), empty milk bag with stamp; right: Cecilia Vicuña, \"HAMBRE (HUNGER)\" (1979), pen on paper drawing Photo documentation of CADA, \"Para no morir de hambre en el arte\" art actions (1979)Photo documentation of different iterations of Lotty Rosenfeld, \"Una Milla de Cruces Sobre el Pavimento\" (One mile of crosses on the pavement, 1981–85).Installation view of Lotty Rosenfeld, \"Una herida Americana\" (1982), 35mm slides from original color videotape on 3/4\" cassette, 5 min.Photo documentation of CADA, \"No+ art\" actions (1981–89)Lotty Rosenfeld: Disobedient Spaces continues at Wallach Art Gallery (615 West 129th Street, West Harlem, Manhattan) through March 15.

In the side gallery, black and white dots drift across the walls, orbiting “and it’s the thing again” (2025) and “ayoyo’s warmness” (2025) like dust motes or scattering seeds. The former, a painting of a creature with a black snakelike body, a white circular head, and a bright orange eye against frantic red and yellow marks, formally echoes the nearby “the thing #1” (2023), a sculpture of a streetlight springing out of a mound of soil, its body marked with a knotted silk scarf that seems to suggest anthropomorphism. In the latter, red dots dance on geometrically divided zones of densely colored, largely monochrome blocks, evoking patterns of East African tapestry. A line of black tassels hangs from the painted linen, recalling the artist’s earlier years in the fashion world.In this room, other smaller works extend that sense of fluidity with quick, brutish charm. Blunt, almost childish brushstrokes, made without any evidence of hesitation, create free forms vaguely recognizable — the tilt of a house’s roof, the triangular silhouette of a mountain, the circle of a sun. A line lunges, reverses, and turns into a wing; a smear of green and blue pushes against a fog of pink; orange orbs hover as if arranged by chance. Rather than posturing toward an encrypted biography, these works turn outward, as if capturing and sharing a slippery memory before it evaporates. The paintings’ red borders — soft, hazy, sometimes glowing — give the impression of aura or heat, the emotional fringe of an image distantly recalled rather than observed. For Uman, images don’t hold still. They are expressions of restless meanings, always slipping into other territories moments later.Uman, \"and it’s the thing again\" (2025), acrylic, enamel, oil, and oil stick on canvasUman’s looping, colliding marks build toward a messiness that feels both impulsive and deliberate, but the paintings never chase virtuosity, sidestepping the sense of transcendence promised by abstract artists like Rothko. It doesn’t feel like she is painting toward escape, but rather toward the world as she carries it: the irrevocable loss of childhood Somalia; the landscapes of Upstate New York that both recall and forestall that original home, performing both delights and failures; and private interior terrains. These paintings suggest to me finding home in places far from the land that first formed her.In “melancholia in a snowy walk” (2025), for instance, a field of spiraling curls and morphing spines form a swirling pastoral scene that feels nearly cosmic. It, along other larger canvases, is installed against deep red walls that infuse the room with a primordial atmosphere that seems to expand the smaller works’ searching energy into vast, surreal compositions. In “first class, window seat” (2025), wavy grids ripple and bend, behaving like an ecstatic meadow of primal colors and suggesting woven textiles, irrigated fields, and the impossible geometry stitching together a life across continents. Up close, stars and cells emerge but never cohere into a realist observation. “melancholia in a fall breeze” (2025) turns fully toward dream logic, immediate yet also mysterious: Pink tides rise beside fluctuating planets. Red circles congregate and reproduce wildly. A wheel-like form glows with neon precision. In “amazing grace glorious morning” (2025), four red circular forms bloom in a row. Are they drums, fruits, or breasts? Nothing is literal, but everything feels inhabited, longingly reconstructed from art-historical fragments, stories, and inherited memories. Across the exhibition, Uman’s symbols remain deliberately opaque. Circles, spirals, arrows, and nests of marks flirt with legibility but refuse translation. That refusal feels not like coyness, but protection — keeping the complexity of diasporic experience intact, unflattened, and unclaimed. Ultimately, what lingers is how these paintings inhabit the space between recognition and estrangement. A sun looks like an eye. A hill looks like a shoulder. A memory looks like weather. Uman paints the distance between the homeland one loses and the homeland one tries, again and again, to dream back into existence. In her hands, abstraction becomes not an escape from history but a vessel for carrying what official records refuse or cannot speak aloud.Uman, \"melancholia in a snowy walk\" (2025), acrylic, oil, oil stick on canvasUman, \"amazing grace glorious morning\" (2025), acrylic, oil, oil stick on canvasUman, \"ayoyo’s warmness\" (2025), oil, oil stick, and mixed media on linenUman, \"diamonds in the sky\" (2024–25), acrylic, enamel, oil, and oil stick on canvasUman, \"tear it all up\" (2024–25), acrylic, enamel, oil, and oil stick on canvasUman: After all the things ... continues at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (258 Main Street, Ridgefield, Connecticut), through May 10.

Like the freedoms we often take for granted, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was hard-won. The designation of the third Monday in January as an official holiday commemorating the legacy of this momentous civil rights leader came after a 15-year battle waged by activists and grassroots groups who, despite pushback from Congress, refused to back down. They knew that there was something powerful about coming together to reflect on the lessons Dr. King left us, and that inscribing a dedicated day in the federal calendar was a way of agreeing, collectively, that he cannot be forgotten.Today, Hyperallergic celebrates Dr. King's outsized contributions as well as the labor and perseverance of those who ensured his remembrance.

But we shouldn't be surprised that San Francisco's tech titans didn't step in to save it, writes Christian L. Frock: The loss of CCA should be considered in relation to staggering wealth disparities and lack of social investment, primarily perpetuated by the technology sector, much of which has tight alliances with today’s leadership in Washington, DC. The indifference of wealth that has long-vexed San Francisco is now a systemic threat to the national ecosystem.What to See During San Francisco Art WeekDespite recent closures in San Francisco’s art world, there's been a mushrooming of alternative spaces, side hustles, home galleries, and nonprofits.

    "body": "\n            As we began 2025, optimism was tested in new ways — bringing to the surface what many of us in the arts had long felt simmering. DEI efforts were forcibly rolled back amid mounting political intervention in museum narratives, and high-profile disputes over representation and authorship played out in public.After Amy Sherald withdrew her exhibition American Sublime from the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery in July, citing concerns over curatorial and interpretive constraints, it was instead taken up by the Baltimore Museum of Art, underscoring how artists were no longer simply negotiating within institutions but actively rerouting around them. The public governance turmoil at the Philadelphia Art Museum was emblematic of a moment in which authority, ownership, and leadership were all being renegotiated at once.Across labor, authorship, and governance, new precedents were being set in real time, without a shared roadmap for what comes next. By year’s end, it was clear that the institutional landscape was changing — not slowly or subtly, but through a series of loud, brash, consequential decisions that revealed just how unsettled the field had become.At the top of 2026 — over snacks and next to a fireplace — I sat down with curator eunice bélidor and arts administrator Dejha Carrington to exchange questions and reactions to the increasing scrutiny of museums. Each of us, in our own way, works beyond but adjacent to art institutions in ways that speak to an evolving field, but still recognize the significance and necessity of these spaces. These conversations are not new for us; we have long shared conversations that move quickly into complexity. And this one felt like a moment to pause and record.Left to right: eunice bélidor (photo by Jean-Sébastien Veilleux), Dejha Carrington (photo by Chantal Lawrie), and Lise Ragbir (photo by Hakeem Adewumi)bélidor is a scholar-in-residence at Concordia University in Montreal, where she lectures about curatorial practices and theory. As an independent curator, her research explores the intersection between letter writing, radical hospitality, and speculative archives.Carrington is a co-founder of Commissioner, an organization that explores collaborative and community-led funding models to commission visual artists. Their membership program helps people collect the work of contemporary artists in their cities. I am a co-founder of VERGE, an agency that seeks to bring exceptional talent and exceptional institutions into alignment where both are set up to thrive.As art institutions determine how they fit into an evolving social and political landscape, this discussion is shared to expand what have become reductive ideas (my own included) about the roles, responsibilities, and potential of art museums. The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Lise Ragbir: As the art landscape shifts, cultural workers and critics, artists and curators, collectors and audiences, are openly grappling with what museums are for — and how they operate. Among these conversations, what stands out?Dejha Carrington: I recently read an essay about the relevance of museums, and what struck me the most was this idea that art had fallen into the bucket of “content.” That conflation — between what is art, and what is content — is significant.LR: eunice, museum content falls squarely on the shoulders of a curator. It is seen as a curator's responsibility to mine, understand, and share that content. But we're seeing a shift in how curators engage with this idea of content.eunice bélidor: Art is not just content. Artists and objects are kind of the vocabulary to do that storytelling. If we look at art and artists only as content creators, we lose the purpose of art-making. Making isn’t just producing an object; it’s about channeling energy or a story through something that can be understood by different people.LR: And that emphasis on reach …eb: … has flattened art into content for the masses. Popularity and visibility become the metric. But reach alone doesn’t tell us much. That’s the difference, for me, between content and storytelling.LR: Since we’re talking about reach, it’s worth considering, too, if or how institutions stand to narrow the story by containing experiences. If art is an experience that transcends language, ultimately that experience can transcend a space. Dejha, how does Commissioner’s work intersect with this idea? DC: Language requires participation and exchange. We talk about meaning-making, but not always about the receiving of meaning — or how that exchange actually happens. When I think about art as a language, I’m thinking about how we are co-creators and collaborators, both informing and receiving within an ecosystem of meaning-making.LR: I’m hearing a shared resistance to treating art as static — whether as content or object — and instead understanding it as something that moves, gathers, and accumulates meaning through relationships and through space.eb: When I think about the work that you do, Dejha, it expands the notion of space and where we experience art. When people gather to collaboratively acquire works, everyone is developing a story with the artist. But the artist is also developing a story with them — with their homes, the places where the work will live, their families, and the future conversations that will unfold when others encounter that work. So where do people experience art? And who is the public? It doesn’t have to be a general public. Can it be an intimate public? I’m very interested in these ideas.DC: Public institutions are hugely important, but not at the expense of the generational conversations that we're having at our kitchen tables, where an art piece can also continue to exist from one person to another. Not all conversations need to take place in institutions, and decentralizing this idea of a singular voice makes way for multiple stories to coexist. We need to cultivate many different perspectives and as many different relationships to the work as possible. Institutions can help carry these conversations in perpetuity, but so can people from one generation to another. LR: The three of us have centered our careers around notions of alignment — meaningful connections between art, people, and place or institution. Historically, museums might have served as the hub of a wheel of alignment, as places of gathering objects that stand to gather people. But we've moved beyond the idea that everybody should come into one space to align with a work of art or works of art in one way. In 2026, it's about finding ways to create meaningful alignments that have longevity. What does this kind of alignment mean to you?DC: When we talk about accessibility or alignment, it’s easy to reduce a conversation about barriers to entry or programming. We could have a free Friday, or host a community program, and that's enough. But meeting people where they are requires layers of unlearning that museums aren’t always equipped to do. Alignment, for me, is about creating multiple points of entry — through organizations, individuals, and relationships — rather than assuming a single institutional solution. The opportunity for deeper storytelling isn't for the story itself. It's a relay of memory so that we can build on knowledge of who we are, where we come from, and how we relate to each other.eb: In some ways I think that art institutions are their own barriers. Accessibility is not just giving access to things, but making yourself accessible to other people's experiences. This is a challenge for museums.LR: You’ve both talked about how institutions do, or don’t, play a role in storytelling or alignment. Do you think you need to leapfrog the institution? Or maybe it’s not about leapfrogging at all.DC: I see it more as conspiring but with loving hands. Institutions are capable of evolving so they are legible to a wider audience. By providing more choices or different points of entry to accommodate different lifestyles, people can choose how they wish to engage.eb: Museums often focus on an artist and their career, and the impact of their work through a broader art historical perspective, because that's mostly the purpose of a museum. But often exhibitions aren’t about those things. They are about the artist’s thoughts, or the things they've experienced that led them to become the artist. These things are as interesting as the story of artists themselves. The institution's focus doesn’t always align with what audiences are looking for.DC: But institutions are groups of people applying what they've learned in said frameworks and systems. If we expand who those participants are, there might be new methodologies that reshape how these institutions evolve.eb: Is there an intersection between the work you do at Commissioner and that of museums?DC: Since we launched in 2017, we've collaborated with over 175 museums, galleries, organizations, collectives, etc. Commissioner only works because we are constantly in partnership with institutions and people. Period. Collaboration is core. We want to make our programs cost-light, participation-heavy. And that only works through these partnerships.LR: It sounds like what you’re both describing isn’t opposition to institutions, but a kind of strategic adjacency. Are you describing a redistribution of power? If so, eunice, how does your curatorial practice intersect with this redistribution?eb: Working at institutions made me realize how people understand the role of the curator as, in some ways, the top of a pyramid. And the decisions they make, and ideas they propose, have such a high value in the scale of art-making decisions. But curators work for artists. You want to make sure they create, and that the work they create is made public in a way that is not one-dimensional. Audiences need to experience the work in multiple ways. That’s my role as a curator: to make more perspectives understood through the work.LR: Do you have a responsibility to interpret the work?eb: Yes. But I also have to make sure that my interpretation is one interpretation. You don't have to understand the work through my perspective, but by telling you my perspective, it values the fact that you also have one that is different from mine that is as valuable in the understanding of the work. All of these different agents are as important and equal in the scale of art presentation. And I like to think that that's what I do with my curating. I make sure that we work collectively to uplift each other's way of understanding different art practices, and by showing that we all view this art through different perspectives, the public understands that their perspective is as valuable as the curators’.LR: Do you have to shape that?eb: I tell my students that curating is not just about putting beautiful things together. When you understand this, all of the different constellations that make up a curatorial practice come together. For me, being a curator is really about making relationships, and making those relationships legible and welcoming to people who are not in the relationship. The many ways in which I try to open up this relationship are part of curating. I often think that the best curators don't always consider themselves to be curators, because they do so many things for the curating to happen. And for me, you're a perfect example, Dejha. DC: Me?[all laugh]Installation view of Traces that Remain (2025), curated by eunice bélidor, at Montréal, arts interculturels (photo by Paul Litherland)DC: When you’re curating a show, eunice, and when you're working with an artist at an institution, how aware are you of the institution's presence? Does it feel like you are creating a protected space? Does the institution figure into your process?eb: When I’m invited to curate a show, a certain kind of relationship is already established when I accept. That’s when I start to think about the exhibition that I want to do, depending on the size of the space, the resources of the space, once I have a clear understanding of what the institution can bring. So yes, the institution itself plays a major role in either the way I make the exhibition or what I can provide to the artist while they are in the space.LR: That's such an interesting take, because you're describing the institution as a supporter of the artist, and you, as a curator, are a broker.DC: I framed my question as, Do you feel like Big Brother is present when you're curating? And you took it to a different place — actually not acknowledging this power dynamic, but instead looking at it as a space of resource, purposefully setting aside this Big Brother mentality. When we talk about institutions we talk about them like they all belong in one big box. But it sounds like you're very intentionally not lumping them together, but looking at everything as its own set of opportunities and resources.eb: I intentionally spoke about being invited to curate these exhibitions. If you're inviting me, then we're going to play level field. And then, based on what you're providing, I can bring in the artist and do the curatorial work that you won't necessarily be able to do without me. If I'm invited, then I will just get comfortable right away.The artists want to have their work on display, and I am working for that to happen. So I need to make sure that I'm the bridge between the institution and the artist. I really want the artist to just have a space to exhibit, rather than being entangled with the dynamics of the institution.LR: You raise a great point: the distinction between an independent curator and a curator who is embedded in the institution. We’ve talked about Maroonage in other conversations — moving beyond the system. You’re doing that.DC: Yeah, it's the same dynamic. Adjacent. We're talking about how we constellate around each other, not one within, or even one organizing from without, but really through different organizing systems. And when we intersect and align, we do, and when we don't, we don't.LR: You both recognize the sort of opportunities that the institutions can provide, and the valuable ways in which institutions can contribute to the ecosystem. But the value isn’t the same as it has been historically.DC: It’s not only that the value is different. It’s because often I don't see myself or Commissioner just working with institutions. I see us working with specific people who work at these places. I'm not thinking about us working with the institution: We’re collaborating around an idea, around an artist, around a curator. That also allows us to move with a lot more fluidity. A person working at an institution might be creating expansive conditions that run circles around an otherwise restrictive system. Let's not forget how many people within said places are also pushing the framework.LR: A two-part question: What's the next iteration of institutions, and what is the next iteration of the value that we place on institutions?DC: Ultimately, it'll be up to people to decide how much they care about institutions and organizations, and to determine their value in society. From my perspective, the future of institutions is going to be community-led. It is up to us to stand up for what we care about. I also think that organizations and models like ours exemplify why it's important to have as many spaces as possible for memory-keeping and for meaning-making.LR: Where do galleries fit into this?DC: There are so many folks who I admire in the gallery spaces doing the tremendous work of being the bridge — helping artists cultivate a professional and sustainable practice, and working diligently in partnership with artists, allowing them to focus on the things they care about most. Those galleries will thrive. More and more collectors, and art supporters, are looking for value alignment. They’re looking for spaces that are willing to go the distance beyond the financial or transactional and that align with them from a values perspective. Do I think that values are going to win the world? It would be too sad to say otherwise. And my mind won't allow me to think that a lesser power will win. LR: What does winning look like? DC: The big ruse for disenfranchising people from art and supporting artists has been that it only belongs to the elite. When really, we are all collectors by nature; when we talk about our grandmother's altars, the cabinets of curiosities that exist in our living rooms. This idea that art only belongs to a precious few has only served those few. Part of our work is to do away with these misconceptions. Collecting art can be an act of care that takes shape out of the love and appreciation of a person or of an idea — that could be enough for us to see each other not as a product of labor, but as a divine person in relationship.eb: I recently read an essay that explored the idea of connoisseurship and how, historically, art critics and art historians became connoisseurs of artists out of the love they had for the artist. This meant they would hang around in their studio, or follow the artists around. Connoisseurship went beyond the objects. Connoisseurs had a deep knowledge of who the artist was, and what they were doing, because they loved them.LR:  Maybe artists, curators, collectors, and institutions — the entire ecosystem — is circling back to that idea of connoisseurship and trying to bring the relationships that you’re talking about, eunice, to as many people as possible. Decentering the labor. We've been trained to be valued on our labor — measured by how we contribute to the system. But we're at this precipice, it seems; able to consider how we contribute, or not, to a system that was never built for us, instead of only trying to clamor into it.DC: The work that we do is in service of liberation. It's about liberating ourselves from this idea of empire, and unlearning systems around value. This is work we need to do together. Maybe that's the part that I'm most proud of with Commissioner — it’s not a collecting program to just help people collect work to put in their homes. But it's the work that we do together that allows everyone to participate. It's the together work. That is the winning work. \n                  \n                      \n                        Interview\n                      \n                  \n        ",

It recognizes contemporary practitioners whose work is regarded as reshaping their fields and influencing the future of culture.\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThis year’s cohort includes artists from ten different countries: visual artist Álvaro Urbano; jazz musician Ambrose Akinmusire; fashion designer Andrea Peña; artist and filmmaker Ayoung Kim; designer Bárbara Sánchez-Kane; sound artist Emeka Ogboh; choreographer Marco da Silva Ferreira; experimental musician Pan Daijing; filmmaker Payal Kapadia; and painter Pol Taburet.\n\t\n\n\tIn addition to the unrestricted funding, each winner will participate in a two-year mentorship and professional development program organized in collaboration with CHANEL’s cultural partners, including London’s Royal College of Art. CHANEL said the initiative is designed to provide artists with long-term support rather than project-based commissions, allowing them to pursue ambitious work on their own terms.\n\n\t“The CHANEL Next Prize creates the conditions for artists to thrive on their own terms,” Yana Peel, CHANEL’s president of arts, culture, and heritage, said in a statement. “Each winner is a trailblazer shaping the now and defining the next with creativity and audacity.”2024’s edition of the CHANEL Next Prize included artists Tolia Astakhishvili, Ho Tzu Nyen, and Dalton Paula among its winners. \n\n\t“The CHANEL Next Prize marks the latest chapter in the House’s century-long commitment to the arts—a legacy that began with Gabrielle Chanel’s support of avant-garde pioneers, from Salvador Dalí to Jean Cocteau,” CHANEL said.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOff the deep waters of Kumejima, Japan, Steven Kovacs captured an image that would be awarded Best in Show for the 2025 Ocean Art Photography Contest. Traveling to the Okinawa prefecture in the hopes of encountering a scarcely documented species of larval goosefish, Kovacs spent nearly two weeks blackwater diving before photographing the rare moment. \n“Unfortunately, this beautiful little fish turned out to be incredibly uncooperative and difficult to photograph,” Kovacs says. “After spending some time with it, I was very fortunate that, for one brief moment, it decided to yawn while facing the camera.” The resulting image is aptly titled “Tired fish.”\nSteven Kovacs, “Tired Fish,” Kumejima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan\nThis past year, the annual contest saw thousands of entries spanning more than 90 countries. From silky sharks in Cuba to small pipefish in Indonesia, each photograph highlights unique, fleeting underwater moments that often go unseen. Awardees took home more than $60,000 in prizes, including once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as diving excursions, cruises, and liveaboard trips.\nTake a plunge into the online gallery of winning images, highlighting 14 distinctive categories.

    "body": "\n            The city of Philadelphia is suing the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the National Park Service (NPS) after officials removed wall text and illustrations describing slavery from a historical park on Thursday, January 22. The removal of exhibits about slavery from Independence National Historical Park comes months after Trump named the site in an executive order calling for reviews of exhibits at the Smithsonian and the National Parks system. Footage captured by the Philadelphia Inquirer shows staff dismantling labels from an exhibition about slavery within the park, which houses the Liberty Bell and the residence of the first United States presidents. The Constitution and Declaration of Independence were also signed on the site’s grounds.In his March 2025 executive order, Trump ordered the DOI, which oversees the NPS, to “take action” to ensure displays at its sites do not “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”A close-up shot of a removed panel describing the history of slaveryAccording to Philadelphia’s lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court, the removed items were part of the $8.5 million outdoor exhibition Freedom and Slavery in Making a New Nation, created in 2009 on the park’s President's House. The exhibition commemorated the lives of nine enslaved individuals whom George Washington brought to his residence. One panel, titled “The Dirty Business of Slavery,” described the Constitution’s failure to outlaw slavery, including its designation of enslaved individuals as three-fifths of a person. It also contained a graphic depicting the routes of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The panel further stated that after the US outlawed the importation of enslaved people, the enslaved population still grew, in part due to forced breeding resulting from the rape of enslaved women by White men. A close-up shot of a removed panel describing the history of slavery.Documentary filmmaker Louis Massiah, who contributed to the exhibition, told Hyperallergic that the screens for the five video vignettes he produced were \"dark” when he visited the site on Thursday.\"I went to the site last night, and it was like looking at a carcass,\" Massiah said.The scripts for the films were written by activist Lorene Cary and featured actor portrayals of individuals enslaved by Washington, including Ona Judge Staines, Martha Washington's seamstress, who escaped in pursuit of liberty. \tMassiah said he didn't know the whereabouts of the video files or the server.In a statement to Hyperallergic, a DOI spokesperson said the removal was in accordance with Trump’s earlier executive order. “Following completion of the required review, the National Park Service is now taking appropriate action in accordance with the Order,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson condemned the City of Philadelphia for “filing frivolous lawsuits in the hopes of demeaning our brave Founding Fathers who set the brilliant road map for the greatest country in the world.” A close-up shot of a removed panel describing the history of slaveryExpecting drastic modifications to the country’s National Park signage, the Minnesota-born project Save Our Signs has already documented the contents of Independence National Historical Park exhibit and others across the country in a public database containing thousands of images. “We at Save Our Signs are angered and disappointed to learn about the removal of the President's House exhibit,” librarian Molly Blake, a founding member of Save Our Signs, told Hyperallergic. “[...] The administration's removal of this exhibit is an act of top-down censorship of history that makes those who agree with this administration's ideology uncomfortable.” Photos from the exhibition collected by Save Our Signs, before its alteration, show detailed text of the removed signage, as well as other exhibits, including a video work accompanied by a text describing how George Washington kept a rotation of enslaved individuals in and out of the state so that they would not become free under Pennsylvania law. In court, Philadelphia argued that the NPS did not have the authority to remove the exhibits, which the city had commissioned in partnership with the federal government. \"The whole site was the result of many years of community organizing and dialogue between local activists, historians, civic leaders, artists, political leaders, and government workers from the city, state, and federal government,\" Massiah told Hyperallergic.An exhibition item documented by Save Our SignsBlake noted that “while we have some photographs of this exhibit, these photographs can never replace the interpretive panels that have been removed.”“The photos help us remember what has been lost, but they are not a replacement for the exhibit, which belongs at the President's House,” Blake said.The extent to which the NPS dismantled the exhibition is unclear. The lawsuit requests the court to stop further removal of “any exhibits, panels, artwork, or other items from the President’s House Site” and asks the DOI “to ensure the safety, security, and preservation of any such items removed from the President’s House Site.” \"In remembering the nine enslaved Africans brought to that house from Virginia by the Washingtons, [the exhibition] allows all of us to understand the presence and crucial role played by Black Americans in the early years of this country,\" Massiah told Hyperallergic. “And also the decisions made about citizenship that have continued to be a major vector in shaping the American experiment.”\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Trump Administration\n                      \n                      \n                        Philadelphia\n                      \n                  \n        ",

The project, begun by artist Ellen Harvey in 2019, currently illustrates over 300 locales from some 40 countries, ranging from the Great Synagogue of Warsaw, the world’s largest Jewish house of worship when it was blown up by the Nazis in 1943, to Bavinger House of Norman, Oklahoma, an award-winning example of organic architecture by Bruce Goff, demolished in 2016. Also on view: the Colossus of Rhodes, felled by an earthquake in 226 BCE, and Tower Records, its retail stores liquidated in 2006, victims of a changing media landscape. Loss is the common ground on which they all stand. Indeed, it is the central conceit of Harvey’s venture, whose subjects are suggested by the public in answer to the following prompt: “Is there some place that you would like to visit or revisit that no longer exists?” The result, on view at the Chicago Architecture Center in a standalone exhibition, fills three walls in an immense and overwhelmingly mournful grid. Each diner, mosque, castle, or library is realistically painted on an 18-by-24-inch panel in black and white acrylic, then finished with oil glazes and labelled, in a smartly chosen range of fonts, with its name, location, and the date on which it ceased existence. Backstories can be read on the project website. The visual effect evokes old, hand-tinted postcards, helpfully causing anywhere to look beautiful and feel longed for, no matter its actual attractiveness. I miss Blockbuster Video greatly, as I miss so much about physical media, but it was never a pretty place. Here it rests, having filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and again in 2014, when the last of its stores closed.Installation view of Ellen Harvey's The Disappointed Tourist at the Chicago Architecture Center (photo Lori Waxman/Hyperallergic)Ellen Harvey, \"Columbian Exhibition–The White City\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardEnhancement is something of a speciality of Harvey’s. The artist, who was born in 1967 in Kent, England, and moved to the United States with her family as a teen, first came to prominence for her New York Beautification Project. From 1999 to 2001, she surreptitiously painted 40 small oval landscapes — gorgeous little things, skillfully done in oil and looking like Romantic-era tags — onto dumpsters, building facades, structural pylons, doors, basically anywhere in the city she wanted, so long as it had already been graffitied. As an experiment in using traditional art making for contemporary ends, it was both brave and clever. The Disappointed Tourist ups the ante a hundredfold, because now the places have meaning.Most of what was personally familiar to me from The Disappointed Tourist I knew from my years living in New York in the early aughts, and Harvey’s picturesque vistas stirred up feelings of nostalgia for an especially exciting time in my own life. They also left me sad and frustrated with the unrelenting and uncaring pace of urban development. Florent, the legendary late-night restaurant in the Meatpacking district — closed in 2008 due to rent increases. 5Pointz, that mecca of graffiti art in Long Island City — whitewashed by the landlord in 2013, and soon after torn down and replaced with condominiums. 2 Columbus Circle, the weirdest white whale of a building — reconfigured in 2008 in the most banal way possible by the Museum of Arts and Design, which should have known better. Tower Records, the World Trade Center, a Key Food in Park Slope — all gone. Chicago, where I have lived ever since, and to which Harvey dedicates 14 paintings, hardly fares any better. RIP Berlin nightclub and the original Prentice Women’s Hospital, designed by Bertrand Goldberg in all its curvy concrete glory.Ellen Harvey, \"Berlin nightclub\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardMost of those transformations can be attributed to the relatively banal causes of gentrification and corporatization. The destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, belongs to a different category entirely, one that accounts for many of the losses on view, from ancient times up to present day. Even without recognizing by name the Great Walls of Benin, Christchurch Greyfriars in London, Sarajevo City Hall, the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, or the Al Nuri Mosque of Mosul, I could confidently guess at which violent conflicts led to their destruction. Sure to be growing in number will be those due to climate change, a list that for now includes the Chacaltaya Glacier in Bolivia, melted away in 2009, and icebergs more generally. Stranger are the casualties of ancient times about which we know little, but can still feel much, like the rainforests that once covered Ireland or the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.Beyond traumatic disasters, The Disappointed Tourist offers an unofficial survey of what people value most. Panels dedicated to the Salem Oak, the Kletterbaum, the Arbol de la Noche Triste prove that places of significance need not be human-made — though mostly they are, and often they’re quite fun. Leisure complexes of all sorts and all eras figure strongly, from the engineering marvels built for international expositions to stadiums ancient and modern. Amazing bathing facilities of yesteryear abound, including the Moskva Pool, the largest in the world, outdoor, circular, and heated year round in central Moscow, until it was torn down in 1994 and replaced with a cathedral; and the Cliftonville Lido in Margate, England, a complex whose giant seaside pool was filled daily by the tide until its closure in 1978. The Savoy Ballroom, the legendary nightclub of Harlem, is here, as is the Toorak Drive-In, a modest theater in Melbourne. Wildly popular in their heyday all, closed or replaced as entertainment evolved.And on and on it goes. In a world of endless change and destruction, of bad luck and time passing, The Disappointed Tourist will always have new places to visit, and Ellen Harvey more canvases to fill. Ellen Harvey, \"Prentice Women's Hospital\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardEllen Harvey, \"Zum Deutschen Eck\" (2025), oil and acrylic on GessoboardThe Disappointed Tourist continues at the Chicago Architecture Center (111 East Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois) through April 19. The exhibition was curated by CAC Senior Director of Exhibitions Eve Fineman.\n                  \n                      \n                        Art Review\n                      \n                      \n                        Reviews\n                      \n                      \n                        Chicago\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

After years of restoration and preparation, visitors to the Worcester Art Museum can now explore the armor galleries, reopened in November of last year. Although there is a fair bit of lore concerned with chivalry and round tables, this armor exhibition goes far beyond the problematic romantic notion of the white knights of medieval Europe. By collectively presenting armor donned by everyone from hoplites to samurai to Sudanese soldiers, the galleries make an important argument for the global appreciation of these wearable pieces of art. Why do certain museums in North America have so much armor in their collections? Armor collecting was quite the hobby of Gilded Age collectors and businessmen like William Randolph Hearst and Clarence H. Mackay. These wealthy men and their foundations donated much of their extensive collections to places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City or the Detroit Institute of Arts. The former, for instance, currently holds the largest collection of arms and armor in the nation, with a staggering 14,000 objects. But what is less well known is that the second-largest armor collection in the United States resides not at the Getty or the Art Institute of Chicago, but within the Worcester Art Museum (WAM) in Massachusetts. A display case focuses on the animal armor worn by horses from across the globe. There are 16th-century shaffrons from Southern Germany and the Ottoman Empire, as well as Chinese stirrups from the 17th-18th centuries. The case also features various spurs and an equestrian figurine from 1900s Ivory Coast.Armor suit influenced by the Mughal invasion of India during the 1500sThe heart of the WAM’s armor collection originally came from the wealthy collector John Woodman Higgins (1874–1961). The son of a major industrialist, he became a steel magnate in Worcester, then known as the “crossroads of New England” due to its status as a key manufacturing hub with access to multiple railroads and a shipping canal. He was fascinated by medieval chivalry and knights. Higgins’s collection focused most heavily on European armor, but included a number of examples outside of medieval Europe as well. In 1931, he opened the Higgins Armory Museum to the public in order to display his collections. That institution closed in 2013, but WAM acquired the archive in 2014. After 12 years, the Higgins armor is back on display, alongside other pieces the institution collected in the intervening years. One of the arms and armor display cases now open in the armory galleries of the Worcester Art MuseumUnknown Artisan, “Corinthian Helmet” (600–550 BCE), bronzeAnd this time, the world of armored knights has gone global. Although medieval European armor appears in the galleries, it is presented with equal billing alongside fascinating works from India, Japan, Egypt, Sudan, Ancient Rome, Classical Greece, and many other places across the globe. Indeed, whatever our modern-day associations may be, one of the earliest known depictions of armor is on the Sumerian Standard of Ur (modern Iraq), which dates to around 2550 BCE and is now held by the British Museum. The WAM presentation carries the history of armor and arms into the present. Visitors can even try on a Mandalorian helmet if they want to engage with the fictional future of the art. Wall diagrams allow visitors to name the various parts of historical suits of armor, such as the samurai armor on display in a glass case. Unknown artisan, “Helmet in the form of a Sea Conch Shell\" (1618), iron with traces of lacquer, textilesHelpful interactive digital displays allow viewers to explore the labels and items within large glass display cases. They can even peruse the open storage collections that are off view due to space restrictions. Wall diagrams helpfully label suits of armor like the Dō-maru gusoku (samurai armor) and traditional European armor from the Middle Ages. While the gallery walls are packed to the hilt with items and weapons, this lends a sense of cohesion and continuity throughout.   The displays and gallery labels point to the fact that armor was not just for use in battle. Beyond warfare, there was a pageantry surrounding the display of this metal fashion, which was often worn within tournaments and during parades as well. I was impressed by the horse armor and spurs on display for viewers, and even more delighted by the “dog armor” based on a 16th-century medieval European armor suit for a Spanish hunting dog. The Met’s former official armorer (that is a real job!), Leonard Heinrich, designed it for the Higgins Museum in 1943. Leonard Heinrich, “Helmutt” (1942), based on 16th-century armor for a Spanish hunting dogDr. Tom Keegan dons a copy of a Mandalorian helmet that visitors can try onIt is refreshing to see medieval Europe decentered but still in conversation with both ancient and medieval armor from across the world. As it turns out, the setting of knights’ tales doesn’t just take place in the storied landscapes of the European Middle Ages. They stretch across Eurasia, Africa, Japan, and beyond. The WAM’s galleries don’t remark on this decentering. The galleries instead demonstrate visually that these tales can and should be revised and retold through the diverse arms and armor donned by warriors, resistors, and aristocrats from across the earth — and even those fighting in a galaxy far, far away. \n                  \n                      \n                        Features\n                      \n                      \n                        Worcester Art Museum\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n            As if demolishing the East Wing, gutting arts agencies, and slapping his name and face on several federal buildings weren't enough, the US president now wants to do away with a DC building known as the “Sistine Chapel of New Deal art.”     This week, we reported on a burgeoning campaign to save the Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building, which houses murals by Ben Shahn, Philip Guston, Seymour Fogel, and other major American artists. We will continue to follow this story.

Cohen Building in Washington, DC, which houses a trove of New Deal-era murals including works by Jewish artists Ben Shahn, Philip Guston, and Seymour Fogel.  The letter co-authored by artists Elise Engler, Joyce Kozloff, and Martha Rosler, reproduced in full at the end of this article, urges the museum and the larger arts community to “speak now on behalf of our artist predecessors” as Trump officials move to expedite the sale of the Cohen Building and, activists fear, demolish it altogether.The Stripped Classicist behemoth anchored just across the National Mall, completed in 1940 as the Social Security Administration's headquarters, now houses the offices of Voice of America and the US Agency for Global Media, both of which Trump has dismantled. Inside and outside the building, murals by Guston, Shahn, Fogel, and sisters Ethel and Jenne Magafan, among other prominent names, stand as a poignant testament to the life-sustaining promise of a social safety net. The works, many painted or carved directly into the structure, portray mothers holding their babies, unemployed laborers, an elderly couple, and an unhoused child sleeping in the street — just some of the populations that benefited from the Social Security Act, passed in August 1935 as part of the New Deal program. Philip Guston's mural in the Cohen Building auditorium (photo by Carol Highsmith via Library of Congress)While several petitions in support of the building and articles about its relevance are already circulating widely, Engler, Kozloff, and Rosler believe that the Jewish Museum, with its recent major exhibitions of Shahn and Guston, is well-positioned to take a public and authoritative stance on the issue — and inspire other institutions to follow suit. The missive was sent on January 9 to the museum's Director James Snyder and Board Chair Shari Aronson, both of whom expressed their support, the letter's co-authors said.In a statement shared with Hyperallergic, Snyder said the Jewish Museum is “deeply committed to the stewardship of art and architecture as part of our shared cultural legacies.” “We have been attentive to this issue since it emerged and responded wholeheartedly when we were approached by Elise Engler, Martha Rosler, and Joyce Kozloff to help support the preservation of the murals,” Snyder said. “We are standing with other art world leaders, artists, and preservationists in advocating for the protection and preservation of these historic murals and are continuing to investigate further strategies to ensure their safekeeping.”Among the more than 380 signatories so far are artist Joan Semmel, whose paintings are currently on view at the museum, and Jenne M. Currie, the daughter of Ethel Magafan — whose oil landscape “Mountains in Snow” (c. 1942), created with her identical twin sister Jenne, hangs in the Cohen Building's boardroom.Seymour Fogel's mural \"Wealth of the Nation\" (1941) seen through the window of the Cohen Building (photo by and courtesy Elise Engler)Engler told Hyperallergic she had been reading about the murals ahead of a December trip to Washington to visit her brother, who was a federal appointee during the Obama administration. She described peeking through the Mall-facing windows to catch a glimpse of the building's interior murals, as entry is accessible only to those with a government ID. Later, she recalled thinking that an ideal repurposing of the building would be as a museum dedicated to the history and enduring relevance of the New Deal; no such institution exists.Amid the torrent of chilling news headlines — from escalating violence against immigrants in Minnesota and nationwide to Trump's dismantling of the geopolitical order — the fight to save a building and its paintings may seem removed from more urgent realities. But research shows that the destruction of cultural heritage is directly linked to human rights violations. It is hardly surprising that the Trump administration, whose policies put millions of Americans at risk of losing essential services like disability insurance and child care funding, is targeting a monument to social assistance.Engler, Kozloff, and Rosler told Hyperallergic they hope their efforts can be part of a broader effort to counter historical erasure.“We are overwhelmed and horrified by the news every day, but this was something we could do as artists: speak out about our heritage, our legacy, and invite other artists to join us,” the letter's authors said.The letter is reproduced in full below. Those who wish to add their signatures can do so here.Dear Chair Aronson: This letter is in regard to the likely demolition of a federal building that contains important historical murals. At least three of the artists whose work is in this building were Jewish — two of whom, Ben Shahn and Philip Guston, are not only canonical artists but integral to the Jewish Museum. We are sending you this letter with attached signatures because we believe that a response from your institution, with its remarkable history and prestige, would have a powerful impact on the decision-making process. The Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building, located just off the mall in Washington, DC, is referred to as the Sistine Chapel of the New Deal for these notable murals. The Trump administration is preparing to sell this building along with three others to private contractors, which will almost certainly guarantee its demolition. The building was meant initially to house the Social Security Administration but never served in that capacity; instead, it housed the Voice of America, now defunded by the current administration. The building is closed to the public, but until recently, visitors could tour its many historic murals. Elise Engler tried to enter the building for that purpose in mid-December but was told by security that special permission from the Government Services Administration (GSA) was required. In a recent post sounding the alarm about the building, the Architect’s Newspaper wrote: \"These works, in addition to sculptural reliefs, most chemically bound or carved into the walls, offer powerful reflections on the meaning of Social Security to working Americans. The artworks are therefore difficult if not impossible to remove.” Time, however, is of the essence in speaking up for this building and saving it from the wrecking ball. A recently retired GSA official told a Washington, DC, federal court in early December that the White House is taking steps to bypass or circumvent the GSA process for four federal buildings on the “accelerated disposals” list, which includes the Cohen Building. The White House has shown its proclivity for acting without regard to well-established rules, not least in its destruction of the East Wing of the White House itself. In counseling haste, we are mindful of the fate of New York’s Bonwit Teller limestone relief panels and bronze latticework, which Donald Trump, as developer, pledged to save and donate to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but in fact made no attempt to do so. In demolishing that building to make way for the Trump Tower, he instead made sure they were smashed. The United States has a woeful record of respecting, preserving, and restoring its public art, especially compared with older and less wealthy countries. As visual artists, we stand in solidarity with the musicians, dancers, and actors who have refused to perform at the Kennedy Center. We must speak now on behalf of our artist predecessors. Since the Jewish Museum hosted both Ben Shahn: On Nonconformity and Draw Them In, Paint Them Out: Trenton Doyle Hancock Confronts Philip Guston in the past year, and your curators have been circulating an active online petition, we'd like to ask you to join in calling for a halt to the sale and destruction of this landmark building and its inspirational art. We look forward to your response. Sincerely, Elise EnglerJoyce KozloffMartha RoslerIn addition, we have collected the following signatures from visual artists and members of the

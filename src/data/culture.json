    "body": "\n\tin History, Religion |   \tDecember 5th, 2025  1 Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nIt would be impos­si­ble to under­stand West­ern civ­i­liza­tion with­out under­stand­ing the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ty. But in order to do that, it may serve us well to think of it as the his­to­ry of Chris­tian­i­ties, plur­al. So sug­gests Hochela­ga cre­ator Tom­mie Trelawny in the new video above, which explains the Gnos­tic Gospels, the “for­bid­den teach­ings of Jesus.” As a sys­tem of beliefs, Gnos­ti­cism is a fair­ly far cry from the main­stream forms of Chris­tian­i­ty with which most of us are famil­iar today. But its sur­viv­ing texts may sound uncan­ni­ly famil­iar, despite also involv­ing out­landish-sound­ing ele­ments that seem to belong to anoth­er civ­i­liza­tion entire­ly. Gnos­tic teach­ings have long been con­sid­ered heresy by Chris­tians, but do they real­ly rep­re­sent just a dif­fer­ent evo­lu­tion­ary branch of the faith: anoth­er Chris­tian­i­ty?\nReli­gious schol­ars of many stripes have con­cerned them­selves with few mat­ters as inten­sive­ly as they have with theod­i­cy, that is, the mat­ter of how to square the notion of a good, omnipo­tent deity with the obvi­ous exis­tence of evil down here in the world. Since its loose coali­tion of beliefs came togeth­er in the late first cen­tu­ry, Gnos­ti­cism has pro­posed an ele­gant solu­tion: that the deity is not, in fact, good, or rather, that under the tran­scen­dent, unknow­able God is a much more poor­ly behaved “demi­urge” who dis­plays an indif­fer­ence, at best, to the lot of human­i­ty. In this view, our result­ing world is less a per­fect cre­ation than a cos­mic mis­take — a propo­si­tion that would account for cer­tain of its qual­i­ties we expe­ri­ence on the day-to-day lev­el, even if we have no par­tic­u­lar reli­gious pro­cliv­i­ties.\nThanks to the dis­cov­ery of Egyp­t’s Nag Ham­ma­di library in 1945, we can direct­ly access many of the teach­ings of the so-called “Gnos­tic Gospels.” They tell us, to make a few grand sim­pli­fi­ca­tions, that our real­i­ty is illu­so­ry and that we can only come to grasp the true nature of both it and our­selves through eso­teric learn­ing, gno­sis being the ancient Greek term for knowl­edge. This world­view may bring to mind that of cer­tain Greek philoso­phers, or indeed that of The Matrix, a near-oblig­a­tory ref­er­ence for a video like this. A quar­ter-cen­tu­ry on from that movie, it’s not hard to under­stand why it res­onat­ed with the siz­able-enough pro­por­tion of human­i­ty who feel alien­at­ed from who they real­ly are or what the world real­ly is — and who, any mil­len­ni­um now, would make rea­son­ably promis­ing can­di­dates to bring about a Gnos­tic revival.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\n3,500 Occult Man­u­scripts Will Be Dig­i­tized & Made Freely Avail­able Online, Thanks to The Da Vin­ci Code Author Dan Brown\nBehold the Codex Gigas (aka “Devil’s Bible”), the Largest Medieval Man­u­script in the World\nThe Phi­los­o­phy of The Matrix: From Pla­to and Descartes, to East­ern Phi­los­o­phy\nThe Ancient Greeks Who Con­vert­ed to Bud­dhism\nDis­cov­er Thomas Jefferson’s Cut-and-Paste Ver­sion of the Bible, and Read the Curi­ous Edi­tion Online\nHow Our Depic­tion of Jesus Changed Over 2,000 Years and What He May Have Actu­al­ly Looked Like\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nLocated in the Yangtze River Delta, Hangzhou is enmeshed in waterways. The city’s center abuts a large lake and sits just north of the Qiantang River, infamous for its magnificent tidal bore that sweeps through the region each fall.\nFor their latest project presented in the Hangzhou Triennial of Fiber Art at Zhejiang Art Museum, Jin Choi and Thomas Shine merged aspects of this local environment and culture with their distinctive process. The artists, who work as Choi + Shine Architects, often create sweeping lace isntallations crocheted in partnership with local communities. Choi typically designs the motif, while Shine focuses on the structure itself. \n\nSuspended above reflective surface mimicking a dark body of water, “Distance” comprises crocheted sculptures representing all 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac. “As society evolves, [the zodiac] continues to find relevance, connecting to the wisdom of the past and the shared narratives that shape our identities today,” the artists write. “Its legacy, with its rich symbolism, cultural significance and unifying power, will endure as a navigational tool in the current and future social shifts.”\nRather than depict a dog or rabbit in its entirety, Choi isolated elements of each animal—find preliminary sketches and reference imagery on the artists’ website. The ox, for example, is represented through a slender tube evocative of a horn, while the rooster can be spotted through a fan-like plume. \nThe installation’s structure is circular and appears to shift depending on the viewer’s perpseicve. “The composition loses its legible visual order and the elements start to form different relations, allowing for varying compositions,” the artists say. This emphasizes “one’s power to position oneself in reference to others, to actively define different connections and relationships.”\nAs for the making-of, Choi + Shine know that community members come to their collaborative process with varying levels of craft experience. Their projects often become educational sessions in addition to community gatherings, as participants demonstrate a particular stitch or help troubleshoot issues. \n\n“Many volunteers are actually novices in crochet, and there are many complex patterns. They may not be very good at crochet, so we are in the process of communicating and collaborating. Beginners and skilled volunteers help each other,” said Wu Qin, who led volunteer efforts for this isntallation.\n“Distance” is now permanently isntalled at the Zhejiang Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nOne of the top comments on a new video from the Victoria and Albert Museum reads as follows: “I think it is time to have a renaissance of mourning. In this age of sanitized and hidden grief, it would be a welcomed relief for a more refined mourning experience.”\nThis commenter is responding to two V&A curators unboxing a collection of 19th-century objects common in Victorian mourning traditions. Through a variety of garments, ephemera, and photos, the pair showcases the elaborate rituals and rites people once used to honor the dead.\n\n\n\nThe video highlights a black, silk gown with tiny pleats, delicate lace, and sequins, along with jewelry made from semi-precious jet stones, and brooches containing human hair. The curators also present several printed artifacts, like mourning cards and portraits of the dying.\nWhat becomes clear throughout the video is how much our contemporary culture of grief and loss has turned inward and is something managed privately rather than shared with a community. “Mourning objects can be personal, portable, ostentatious, sentimental, or even a little bit grizzly,” the curators add. “Is it too much? Or do you think we should mourn the passing of these poignant and fascinating trappings of grief?”\nFind the unboxing on YouTube, along with several additional adventures in the museum’s collections.\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

As part of a three-year investigation that will inform upcoming restoration work, archaeologists discovered 60 flint flakes they believe were used as tools around 4,300 BCE during the Mesolithic or early Neolithic period. The archaeologists also uncovered additional items, including 800-year-old footwear and a 19th-century beer jug. The group noted that the flint artifacts predate Stonehenge's earliest earthworks by 1,000 years. At Stonehenge, flint tools are believed to have been used to chip and shape stone. The flint artifacts, said the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority in a press release, originated from the now-gone Thorney Island, formed by the once intersecting Thames and River Tyburn. Prehistoric people, archaeologists said, used that island stretch for fishing, hunting, and food gathering. The objects were discovered in the Cromwell Green section of the property.Flint artifacts believed to be 6,000 years old (image courtesy Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority)The discovery comes as parliament weighs costly options for the much-needed restoration of the building. Parliament was expected to vote on a final plan for the restoration of the palace later this year, but the process appears to be delayed again as members contend with a multibillion-pound price tag on the renewal. Proponents for urgent restoration caution against increasing fire risk to the building as it ages. Over the last decade, there were a reported 44 fires in the building. Judith Cummins MP, Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority board chair, said in a statement that the discovery came as part of inquiries into the building's history as it prepares for a major renovation \"to understand more about the building and the thousands of years of history underneath the home of Parliament.\" Nine areas of the Westminster campus are subject to the investigations, including the Royal Court, Speaker’s Court, and the Thames River shoreline. The discovery comes ahead of an expected restoration of the historic palace.\"It is vital we continue these investigations to understand what lies beneath the ground here at an early stage to inform and guide decisions on design and further surveys ahead of future enabling and construction works,\" Diane Abrams, the lead archaeologist for the investigations, said in a statement. \"This ensures the site’s extraordinary heritage and archaeology is managed appropriately while enabling the safe and efficient delivery of the Restoration and Renewal Programme.”Earlier this year, archaeologists at the site uncovered part of a medieval two-story hall from 1167, believed to have burnt completely in the 19th century, which once served as a dining area and as the Court of Chancery, the Court of Requests, and for parliamentary functions. In a statement, the Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority said this previous discovery had been the most important of the group's work to date.The investigations will carry on through 2026, and a final report on the group's findings will be released in 2027.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

    "body": "\n    \n                News\n                Proponents of a new measure say royalties will allow visual artists to benefit from their career growth over time.\n            \n                \n                                \n                            \n                \n            \n                \n        \n            Kenojuak Ashevak's \"The Enchanted Owl\" (1960) (image courtesy Dorset Fine Arts)\n    \n        \n            Visual artists in Canada may soon receive royalties from the resale of their works after the government announced its intent to amend its copyright laws last month.In Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first budget bill, passed narrowly on November 17, the government said it intended to establish an “Artist’s Resale Right,” a directive that would entitle artists to royalties from secondary and future sales of their artworks. One clause of the bill states that the measure would help create secondary income streams for visual artists, who are among Canada’s lowest earners and, like artists in the United States, currently do not receive royalties if their work's value increases after its initial sale.Proponents of the measure say royalties will allow artists to benefit from their career growth over time, and that it will particularly benefit Indigenous artists whose work is “commonly exploited on the secondary market,” according to the nonprofit Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des artistes canadiens (CARFAC). A similar bid for royalties failed in Canada in 2022. Artist's Resale Right (ARR) is commonly recognized by countries in the European Union, entitling artists to a cut of each subsequent sale of their artworks. In France, for example, artists can pocket 3% an art sale of between €50,000 €200,000 ($58,189.50 and $232,758). In the United Kingdom, a work must sell for at least £1,000, and royalties are capped at £12,500 (~$1,332.51 and ~$16,657.34, respectively). The UK law applies to artists during their lifetime and for the 70 years following their death. The United States does not currently recognize a federal Artist’s Resale Right, and a California law implementing up to 5% in royalties for artists was struck down in 2018 after a federal judge ruled that federal copyright laws prevented the measure. The Canadian government has not announced specific royalties yet, nor a timeline for the implementation of an Artist’s Resale Right. A spokesperson for the Department of Canadian Heritage told Hyperallergic that amendments to the country's copyright laws will be brought forth “at the earliest possible opportunity, with details to be made public when the bill is tabled.” The spokesperson added that the government expects the budget bill to support Indigenous artists, who make up 4.1% of visual artists in the country and are most highly represented in the visual arts, as compared to other creative disciplines.April Britski, CARFAC's national executive director, believes that artists in Canada could receive between CA$3 and CA$5 million in total royalties annually (~$2.13 and $3.55 million) under an official Artist's Resale Right. The organization has issued a proposal recommending that the government implement 5% royalties on all works selling for at least CA$1,000 (~$721.07). “[The Artist's Resale Right] is particularly beneficial for Indigenous and senior artists, and it is a critical step forward in improving the economic conditions of Canadian artists,” Britski told Hyperallergic in an email.CARFAC’s website cites late Inuk artist Kenojuak Ashevak’s sale of editions of her stonecut print “Enchanted Owl” (1960) in support of an Artist's Resale Right. An edition was later resold for CA$216,000 (~$156,131.50) in 2018, and one is now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. Neither Ashevak nor her estate received any of the profits from the resale of her work.“There can often be a huge markup on secondary sales of their work, so ARR is an important opportunity for economic reconciliation,” Britski continued.A second budget bill with further details about the copyright amendments and resale right is expected to reach the House of Commons later in the winter, according to Britski.“We're not quite there, but it is coming, and Canadian artists will soon be able to share in the profits made on their work in the secondary market,” Britski said. \n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        Canada\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

The Pritzker Prize-winning architect suffered a respiratory illness before his death at his home in Santa Monica, California, his chief of staff told the New York Times.A monumental figure who demystified modern architecture and an early adopter of computer-driven design, Gehry became beloved for his luminescent, curvilinear structures that appeared to defy gravity. His postmodern designs of museums, concert halls, and libraries have become destinations for tourists as much as the venues themselves. His most revered accomplishment is arguably the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in northern Spain, which was immediately hailed as one of the masterpieces of 20th-century architecture when it opened to the public in 1997. Philip Johnson, no postmodernist slouch himself, called the museum design “the greatest building of our time” and proclaimed Gehry as “the greatest architect we have today.”Gehry visited the museum 25 years later and told Time magazine that he loved how vibrant the city around his building had become.“There’s a whole feeling of life that’s different,” he said. “It makes me feel good that we contributed to that.”Museo Guggenheim Bilbao (photo by Naotake Murayama via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)A spokesman for the Solomon Guggenheim Museum and Foundation said the organization was “deeply grateful” for his contributions to the Guggenheim’s landmark museums.“His daring vision and design brilliance reshaped the field of architecture and our contemporary world. Gehry showed us how powerful and transformative museum architecture can be,” the Guggenheim spokesperson said in a statement to Hyperallergic. “Frank will be greatly missed, and we know that his legacy will inspire many generations to come.”Born Frank Owen Goldberg in Toronto, Canada, in 1929, Gehry sometimes worked part-time in his grandfather’s hardware store, exposing him to the everyday materials that made houses and other buildings, while his father held several different jobs that included managing a grocery store and selling manual slot machines.In 1947, his family immigrated to California and he got a job driving a delivery truck while attending Los Angeles City College before enrolling in the University of Southern California’s School of Architecture. He graduated in 1954 and soon moved across the country to study architecture at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design but dropped out of the program, and later began designing furniture out of cardboard and masonite.He returned to Los Angeles in 1957 and began designing his first private residence. Five years later he started his practice, which formally became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967. His innovative designs including the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro and the California Aerospace Museum dotted Southern California in the 1980s. By the end of the decade he had won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, whose jury compared him to Pablo Picasso.“Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes,” the jury wrote. “His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.”The Dancing House in Prague (photo by Danny Alexander Lettkemann via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)An even more esteemed collection of commissions that brought Gehry international acclaim soon followed. Gehry completed the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art in Minneapolis in 1993, the Cinemathèque Française in Paris in 1994, and Dancing House in Prague in 1996, before unveiling his Guggenheim masterpiece. Gehry won the commission for the Walt Disney Concert Hall, one of the most beloved concert venues in the nation, in 1987, and the structure was inaugurated in 2003. By 2011, Gehry reinvigorated Manhattan’s skyline with his design of 8 Spruce Street, a 76-story skyscraper known for its distinctive undulating steel facade that resembled woven fabric.MaryAnne Gilmartin, who worked with the architect to build 8 Spruce when she was an executive at Forest City Ratner, called Gehry “a true original — an artist, an architect, and a fearless visionary who changed the way we experience cities.” “Frank approached every challenge with curiosity, generosity, and an unshakeable belief in the power of design to inspire people’s daily lives,” Gilmartin, founder and CEO of MAG Partners, told Hyperallergic. “He didn’t start with formulas or conventions — he started with emotion. He wanted buildings to move people, to feel alive in the city, and to create moments of unexpected beauty.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObituaries\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank Gehry\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n",

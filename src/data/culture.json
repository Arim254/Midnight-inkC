    "body": "\n\tin History, Maps |   \tNovember 7th, 2025  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\nEvery­where you look, you can find traces of the ancient Roman civ­i­liza­tion from which the mod­ern West descends. That’s espe­cial­ly true if you hap­pen to be look­ing in Europe, though echoes of Latin make them­selves heard in major lan­guages used all over the world. Take, for exam­ple, the com­mon Eng­lish word itin­er­ary, mean­ing a planned route for trav­el, which descends from iter, the Latin word for a jour­ney, route, or path. The Romans even­tu­al­ly spoke of itin­er­aria, which meant more or less the same thing as we do when we speak of our trav­el itin­er­aries. Now, bridg­ing these dis­tant eras, we have Itiner‑e, a new online map of ancient Rome’s road net­work, the most com­pre­hen­sive yet.\nOrig­i­nal­ly envi­sioned as a kind of “Google Maps for Roman roads,” Itiner‑e is a project of Tom Brugh­mans of Aarhus Uni­ver­si­ty, and Pau de Soto Caña­mares and Adam Pažout of the Autonomous Uni­ver­si­ty of Barcelona. Its users can dig­i­tal­ly explore near­ly 300,000 kilo­me­ters of roads laid across the vast Roman Empire at its height in the mid-sec­ond cen­tu­ry — or at least as much of that net­work as edu­cat­ed guess­es can recon­struct.\nResearchers can only be sure about less than three per­cent of the net­work, with anoth­er sev­en per­cent of ancient Roman roads doc­u­ment­ed in exis­tence if not in pre­cise loca­tion. Regard­less, Itiner‑e is based on an unprece­dent­ed­ly wide (and open) dataset, which incor­po­rates topo­graph­ic map­ping, satel­lite imagery and cen­turies of his­tor­i­cal records.\n\n\n\t\n\nAmong Itin­er-e’s many fea­tures is a con­fi­dence rat­ing, which shows just how con­fi­dent we can be that any giv­en road actu­al­ly looked like it does on the map. You can also view the whole thing in 3D to get a sense of the ele­va­tions involved in con­struc­tion and trav­el of the net­work; use a rout­ing tool to deter­mine sug­gest­ed routes around the empire “by foot, ox cart or don­key”; and even check satel­lite imagery to find still-extant parts of Roman roads and draw com­par­isons with the same parts of the world today. Though a fair few major Roman roads have evolved into cur­rent routes for trains and auto­mo­biles, we can’t exact­ly trav­el on them in the same way the Romans did. Still, when next you plan a Euro­pean itin­er­ary of your own, con­sid­er punch­ing it in to Itiner‑e and see­ing how the jour­ney most like­ly would’ve been made 1,875 years ago.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Romans Built Their Roads, the Life­lines of Their Vast Empire\nThe Roads of Ancient Rome Visu­al­ized in the Style of Mod­ern Sub­way Maps\nA Map Show­ing How the Ancient Romans Envi­sioned the World in 40 AD\nBuilt to Last: How Ancient Roman Bridges Can Still With­stand the Weight of Mod­ern Cars & Trucks\nThe Roman Roads and Bridges You Can Still Trav­el Today\nPlan Your Trip Across the Roads of the Roman Empire, Using Mod­ern Web Map­ping Tech­nol­o­gy\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nSet against glowing backdrops of desert, city skylines, skate parks, and anonymous interiors, Gerwyn Davies’ vibrant photographs merge fashion photography with elaborate and sometimes bizarre handmade costumes. His practice harkens back to some of his first experiments with photography, when he and a group of friends would stage collaborative portraits in which they’d take turns operating the camera, posing, and searching the house for lamps to light the scene.\n“It was Vogue magazine on a B-horror film budget,” Davies says. “I was transfixed by the potential to fabricate fantasy through photography and from that point I was very excited about what else I could do with it.” He credits those early, playful experiments with his continued fascination with readymades and a highly constructed approach to making a photo.\n\nDavies describes his practice as “queer photographic self-representation.” He designs and creates the costumes himself, transforming the human figure into a sculptural form. Sometimes garments envelop his entire body, but even if his legs or arms are visible, the head is always obscured. When he takes the photo, Davies works blind, snapping a sequence of automatic shots while he quickly performs for the camera. From these, he later selects a final image.\nWhether made of sequined fabric, vinyl, or faux fur, Davies’ costumes border on the quirky, humorous, and even absurd, as he explores the fluid relationship between fantasy and reality. He also plays with notions of what portrait photography is—or it’s intended to reveal about the sitter. In this case, “the subject, which is always me, is conspicuous in the frame,” the artist says, but the nature of concealment adds a playful, sometimes slightly unsettling layer of complexity. He continues: \n\nThe use of elaborate costumes, often fabricated with shimmering and sparkling materials, makes the subject almost hyper-visible. At the same time however, the specifics of the subject are unable to be seen. The face is always obstructed by fabric and the precise dimensions of the figure wildly distort, meaning the subject is impossible to take in fully…the subject is both there and not there, seen and unseen, they are hidden in plain sight.\n\nDavies’ work is featured in Exposure: Contemporary Photographers in Australia and New Zealand, and you can find more on his website and Instagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t",

    "body": "\n\n\t\nAcross a wide range of media, from painting to textiles to works on paper, Faith Ringgold (1930-2024) developed a practice that merged history, activism, formal inquiry, and global influences. Born and raised in Harlem, New York, her work evolved from her awareness of politics and social issues in the 1960s and 1970s, which she channeled into “an incisive narrative about the historical sacrifices and achievements of Black Americans,” says Jack Shainman Gallery.\nOpening this month at the gallery, a retrospective spans Ringgold’s explorations of textiles, sculpture, and works on canvas. She is renowned for her story quilts, which combine fabric and embroidery with painted tableaux of Harlem, jazz clubs, portraits—especially of women—and historical references to slavery and the oppression of Black people in America.\n“American People Series #19: US Postage Commemorating the\nAdvent of Black Power” (1967), oil on canvas, 72 x 96 inches\nEarlier this year, a documentary called “Paint Me a Road Out of Here” was released that chronicles the artist’s first public art piece, a feminist mural at the Women’s House of Detention on Rikers Island. The mural, “For the Women’s House” contains eight segments—patchwork-like—that contain images of women in predominantly male career roles. Works like “American People Series #19: US Postage Commemorating the Advent of Black Power” and “Black Light #11: US America Black” mirror this motif, redolent of a quilt, which presages her later work.\nAt Jack Shainman Gallery, Faith Ringgold highlights the artist’s extraordinary and innovative approach to figuration, perspective, and material. She was acutely aware of the art historical canon as a predominantly white space, so she “sought out forms more suitable to the exploration of gender and racial identity that she so urgently pursued,” the gallery says. In the 1970s, she traveled to Europe and onward to Africa, gathering ideas.\nWhen she first began working with textiles, Ringgold made what she called “tankas,” which were inspired by sacred Tibetan thangkas—textile images intended for meditation—that she saw on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Ringgold’s iterations incorporated sewn fabric borders around paintings made on unstretched canvas.\n“Jazz Stories: Mama Can Sing, Papa Can Blow #8: Don’t Wanna Love You Like I Do” (2007), acrylic on canvas with pieced fabric border, 82 x 67 inches\nEventually, these works became more abstract, then morphed into soft sculptures and performance pieces inspired by African masking traditions. As her work evolved into the 1980s, the story quilt emerged as a way to render imagery on a larger scale and connect with time-honored textile craft traditions often associated with women. Jack Shainman says:\n\n The significance of Faith Ringgold’s life continues to be felt and understood in new, urgent and relevant ways…Just as she fought tirelessly against the prevailing sentiments of racial and gendered exclusion of both her time and our own, so too did her inimitable work in textiles provide an example of how life and art—so often presumed to be separate—are in fact deeply and fundamentally intertwined.\n\nFaith Ringgold opens on November 14 and continues through January 24 in New York City. Explore more of the artist’s work on her estate’s website and Instagram.\n“Love Letter: No Kiss” (1987), intaglio on canvas, pieced canvas, and beads, 65 x 52 inches\n“Feminist Series #4: I Have to Answer For…” (1972), acrylic on canvas with cloth quilted border, 47 x 34 1/2 inches\n“Black Light #11: US America Black” (1969), oil on canvas, 60 x 84 inches\n“Slave Rape #4 of 16, Run” (1973, 1993), acrylic on canvas with cloth quilted border, 52 1/2 x 34 1/2 inches\n“Jazz Stories: Mama Can Sing, Papa Can Blow #5: You Put the Devil in Me” (2004), acrylic on canvas with pieced fabric border, 81 1/2 x 67 1/2 inches\n“Slave Rape #1 of 16, Run” (1973, 1993), acrylic on canvas with cloth quilted border, 49 x 34 inches\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Light Work has also published over 200 issues of Contact Sheet, which is one of the longest-running art photography publications in the world, showcasing contemporary photographers since 1977. \nWe continue to support artists through special book projects, local grants for lens-based talent in Central New York, and over 400 exhibitions in our multiple galleries. Over 25,000 artists, students, and patrons have used Light Work’s state-of-the-art photo and digital lab to make new work. The community-access facility is designed for intuitive use to create museum-quality art. \n\nBarbara Bosworth, “Lily of the Valley” (2006)\nAnother initiative Light Work has to aid in artists’ visibility is our collection. It includes more than 4,000 photographs and unique objects donated by former artists-in-residence, exhibiting artists, and our supporters, including Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, and Dawoud Bey, all of which can be accessed online.\nLastly, Light Work’s Urban Video Project (UVP), in partnership with the Everson Museum of Art and Onondaga County, is an outdoor architectural projection venue dedicated to the public presentation of film, video, and moving image arts. UVP is one of few projects in the United States dedicated to ongoing public projections, adding a new chapter to Central New York’s legacy as one of the birthplaces of video art by using cutting-edge technology to bring work of the highest caliber to Syracuse, New York.\nTo learn more, visit lightwork.org. \nContact us at info@lightwork.org or (315) 443-1300.\n\nGuanyu Xu, “Boston Customs #4 (shadow in the bardini garden)” (2025)\n\nPaul Mpagi Sepuya, “Self-Portrait in the Studio Mirror (_DSF5443)” (2024)\n\nJim Goldberg, “Mattress Shoes – Vans Vault (Artist Collaboration with Vans)” (2020)\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t",

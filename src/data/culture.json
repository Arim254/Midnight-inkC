    "body": "\n\tin Psychology |   \tFebruary 9th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe age of social media has shown human­i­ty a fair few truths about itself, not all of them flat­ter­ing. But once in a while, one of the waves of dis­course that roll through the inter­net real­ly does help us bet­ter under­stand one anoth­er. Take the sur­prise some have expressed in recent years upon find­ing out that the expres­sion to “pic­ture” some­thing in one’s head isn’t just a fig­ure of speech. You mean that peo­ple “pic­tur­ing an apple,” say, haven’t been just think­ing about an apple, but actu­al­ly see­ing one in their heads? The inabil­i­ty to do that has a name: aphan­ta­sia, from the Greek word phan­ta­sia, “image,” and pre­fix -a, “with­out.”\nThat same tem­plate has late­ly been used to cre­ate anoth­er term, anen­dopha­sia, whose roots endo and pha­sia mean “inner” and “speech.” As you might expect, the word refers to the lack of an inter­nal mono­logue. That sounds bizarre to many who hear it for the first time: some because they can’t imag­ine think­ing in words, and oth­ers because they can’t imag­ine think­ing in any­thing else.\nThese, as explained in the Void­ed Thoughts video above, are just some of the ways the expe­ri­ences inside our heads dif­fer. Some 40 per­cent of us hear and even have con­ver­sa­tions with “inter­nal voic­es,” about 50 per­cent of us see things in our mind’s eye instead, and some 20 per­cent report think­ing exclu­sive­ly in feel­ings. Those who belong to one of those groups will have trou­ble imag­in­ing what life is like for any­one in the oth­ers.\nThis owes to the inher­ent inac­ces­si­bil­i­ty of one human being’s sub­jec­tive expe­ri­ence to anoth­er, a con­di­tion that has bedev­iled philoso­phers prac­ti­cal­ly since the emer­gence of their pro­fes­sion. But sci­en­tif­ic researchers have also been look­ing into it, and their stud­ies have sug­gest­ed that the capac­i­ty for inter­nal mono­logues and men­tal pic­tures makes more than a triv­ial dif­fer­ence in one’s life. Visu­al thinkers, the video notes, tend to be bet­ter at mem­o­riza­tion; ver­bal thinkers “usu­al­ly have an edge when it comes to plan­ning, prob­lem-solv­ing, and rehears­ing,” but they’re also “more prone to loop­ing thoughts.” In prac­tice, most of us use both forms of think­ing in dif­fer­ent pro­por­tions depend­ing on the sit­u­a­tion, and thus, to an extent, enjoy both sets of advan­tages — and should watch out for both sets of dis­ad­van­tages.\nRelat­ed con­tent:\nHow to Silence the Neg­a­tive Chat­ter in Our Heads: Psy­chol­o­gy Pro­fes­sor Ethan Kross Explains\nHow to Improve Your Mem­o­ry: Four TED Talks Explain the Tech­niques to Remem­ber Any­thing\nThe Secret to High Per­for­mance and Ful­fil­ment: Psy­chol­o­gist Daniel Gole­man Explains the Pow­er of Focus\nWhy You Do Your Best Think­ing In The Show­er: Cre­ativ­i­ty & the “Incu­ba­tion Peri­od”\nWhat a Lack of Social Con­tact Does to Your Brain\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tin Architecture |   \tFebruary 9th, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nFew pro­fes­sion­als tend to live as long, or mature as slow­ly, as archi­tects. Frank Gehry died late last year at the for­mi­da­ble age of 96, with sev­er­al projects still under con­struc­tion. But he’d only real­ly been Frank Gehry for the past half-cen­tu­ry or so: not in the sense of hav­ing changed his name from Frank Gold­berg (a choice he made in his twen­ties and lat­er came to regret), but in hav­ing plant­ed his first rec­og­niz­able flag in the built envi­ron­ment. The envi­ron­ment was a qui­et mid­dle-class res­i­den­tial neigh­bor­hood in San­ta Mon­i­ca; the flag was his own home, a mod­est Dutch Colo­nial fix­er-upper orig­i­nal­ly built in 1920, and trans­formed by Gehry into what resem­bled a high­ly con­trolled indus­tri­al dis­as­ter.\n“He for­ti­fied parts of the pas­tel-paint­ed, shin­gled exte­ri­or with cor­ru­gat­ed steel, wrapped lay­ers of chain-link fenc­ing over oth­er por­tions in angu­lar planes not seen since Russ­ian Con­struc­tivism, and slammed a tilt­ed cubic sky­light, which looked as if it had fall­en from out­er space, into the kitchen,” writes New York Review of Books archi­tec­ture crit­ic Mar­tin Filler in his remem­brance of the archi­tect.\n“In the inte­ri­or he exposed walls down to the wood­en studs and treat­ed ves­ti­gial white plas­ter patch­es as though they were Robert Ryman paint­ings. Para­dox­i­cal­ly, this messy mash-up also exud­ed a cozy domes­tic­i­ty,” a qual­i­ty on dis­play in Beyond Utopia: Chang­ing Atti­tudes in Amer­i­can Archi­tec­ture, a 1983 doc­u­men­tary co-writ­ten by Filler that includes an inter­view with Gehry in the house­’s kitchen.\n\n\n\t\n\nAbout fif­teen years before the Guggen­heim Bil­bao, and two decades before Dis­ney Con­cert Hall, the star­chi­tect-to-be sits in the kitchen of his rad­i­cal­ly ren­o­vat­ed home with his two young sons. “I like that when you look through the top you can see down here in the kitchen,” says one of them. Now, here to speak more expan­sive­ly on the pro­jec­t’s virtues, and how they fit into the longer arc of Gehry’s career, is archi­tect and star of Archi­tec­tur­al Design’s Youtube chan­nel star Michael Wyet­zn­er, with a new video called “What Frank Gehry’s Per­son­al Home Teach­es Us About Cre­ative Risk.” And indeed, such risk-tak­ing stood out in his own gen­er­a­tion, most of whose major archi­tects adhered one way or anoth­er to mod­ernist or post­mod­ernist trends. As his home ren­o­va­tion sig­naled, Gehry decid­ed to go his own way.\nAt a glance, the jagged, almost aggres­sive look of the Gehry res­i­dence may hard­ly bring to mind the gleam­ing metal­lic curves, almost invari­ably described as “undu­lat­ing,” of the Guggen­heim Bil­bao and Dis­ney Hall. But Wyet­zn­er finds deep­er res­o­nances with var­i­ous ele­ments of the aes­thet­ic sen­si­bil­i­ty that Gehry cul­ti­vat­ed in his work from his mid­dle-age self-rein­ven­tion through his nona­ge­nar­i­an emi­nence, not least empha­siz­ing the impres­sion of move­ment and the “noisy ver­sus qui­et” visu­al dynam­ic. Con­trast is pow­er, as all artists under­stand on one lev­el or anoth­er — and, per­haps, as Frank Gehry came to under­stand that while hang­ing out with Los Ange­les artists before he made his name. Though he nev­er exact­ly joined their ranks, it is as an “artist-archi­tect,” in Wyet­zn­er’s words, that he will be remem­bered.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow Frank Gehry (RIP) and the Guggen­heim Muse­um Bil­bao Changed Archi­tec­ture\nGehry’s Vision for Archi­tec­ture\nVis­it the Homes That Great Archi­tects Designed for Them­selves: Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Cor­busier, Wal­ter Gropius & Frank Gehry\nOn the Impor­tance of the Cre­ative Brief: Frank Gehry, Maira Kalman & Oth­ers Explain its Essen­tial Role\nTake an Online Course on Design & Archi­tec­ture with Frank Gehry\nA Walk­ing Tour of Los Ange­les Archi­tec­ture: From Art Deco to Cal­i­for­nia Bun­ga­low\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\tOne of the seven wonders of the ancient world, according to traditional lists, the Lighthouse of Alexandria once loomed over the Mediterranean city’s harbor during Egypt’s Hellenistic age. At 460 feet tall, it was second only to the Great Pyramid of Gaza in height.\n\n\tThe lighthouse, also known as the Pharos of Alexandria, was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter (c. 367–283 B.C.), a Macedonian Greek general under Alexander the Great who became pharaoh of Egypt; it was seen to completion by his son and successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus. During the Ptolomaic dynasty, which lasted 300 years, Alexandria was a center of Greek culture in Egypt.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tLocated on the island of Pharos off the coast of Alexandria, the lighthouse was constructed of stone and was rectangular at the bottom, octagonal in the middle, and cylindrical at the top. It used mirrors and a furnace to guide ships to the city’s harbor.\n\n\tThe building, already weakened by previous tremblors, was destroyed by the 1303 Crete earthquake, most of its remains disappearing under rising seas. Now, however, as reported in the New York Times, a group of historians, architects, and programmers are working to create a digital 3-D model of the ancient structure.\n\n\t“The architectural fragments lie scattered over 18 acres underwater,” Isabelle Hairy, an archaeologist at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and the Center for Alexandrian Studies in Egypt and leader of the Pharos Project team, told the Times.\n\n\tLast summer, the Pharos Project team used a crane to bring granite blocks and other relics to the surface so they could be scanned and digitally positioned in the 3-D model. One major discovery was a pylon combining Greek building skills with Egyptian stylistic elements.\n\n\tSo far, the project has made seabed scans of some 5000 building elements and artifacts on the sea floor; worsening water conditions, however, make it likely that further scans will rely on raising submerged material from the water before returning it to the sea for preservation. “The visibility is extremely bad,” Hairy told the Times, “the seabed is uneven and there are no clear layers of sediment.” Because of this, she estimates it will take generations to complete the project.\n",

    "body": "\n\tIn mid-December, on a tour of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, Abby Jones, the acting chief of protocol at the State Department, floated the idea that the Smithsonian should create a dedicated gallery featuring multiple images of President Donald Trump, according to the New York Times. This, of course, would be in addition to his official portrait.\n\n\tLater, administration officials noted that the White House regularly receives artworks depicting the President from supporters and suggested that some of it could be displayed at the museum.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\t“President Trump receives an unprecedented amount of beautiful artwork from patriotic Americans all across our great country,” a statement released by the White House said, “and it is important to the People’s President that their creations are showcased throughout the halls of our Nation’s Capital.”\n\n\tThere is no formal proposal on the table, the Times reported, and it remains unclear how seriously the idea is being considered, since the Smithsonian has not received an official request.\n\n\tThe National Portrait Gallery regularly includes more than one image of past Presidents in its permanent installation. But the museum’s standard practice has been to debut its commissioned portraits only after a President has completed his time in office.\n\n\tThe discussion follows a recent change at the museum. Last month, the gallery replaced Trump’s original official photograph with a different image he found more flattering. At the same time, it removed wall text referencing his two impeachments. The museum said the changes were part of a “broader update” to the exhibition and that the history of impeachments continues to be addressed elsewhere in its galleries.\n\n\tTensions between the White House and the Smithsonian have nearly boiled over since the start of Trump’s second term. The president has criticized what he described as ideological bias in museum displays and has pressed the institution for detailed information about its content and finances. Smithsonian officials, meanwhile, say that the institution operates independently of the executive branch.\n\n\tIn the meantime, visitors to the National Portrait Gallery can already see Trump’s current official image: a black-and-white photograph by White House photograph Daniel Torok showing the president scowling over the Resolute Desk. Whether that single portrait eventually gains company remains an open question, but despite professing its autonomy, the museum leadership have in the past buckled under White House pressure. Last year, the President said he had fired Kim Sajet, then the museum’s director, for a variety of reasons, including the wall texts that mentioned Trump’s impeachment. Sajet continued reporting to work before resigning.\n",

He had led the Institut du Monde Arabe since 2013.\n\n\tThe immediate catalyst was a tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice on January 30. In those files, Lang and his daughter, Caroline Lang, appear among hundreds of public figures whose names are connected in some way to Epstein’s vast web of contacts. Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tTheir inclusion in the files does not in itself suggest any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s crimes. Still, the fallout in France was swift. \n\n\tProsecutors announced that they had opened a preliminary investigation into Jack and Caroline Lang for alleged “aggravated tax fraud money laundering,” a move that increased political pressure. Lang was reportedly summoned to the French Foreign Ministry at the request of President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu. Rather than wait for that meeting, he chose to resign.\n\n\tIn a letter explaining his decision, Lang described the current atmosphere as toxic and said he was stepping aside to shield the institution from further harm. Speaking to Agence France-Presse, he called the accusations “baseless” and said he welcomed the investigation because it would confirm that he had done nothing wrong.\n\n\tThe attention has centered in part on Caroline Lang’s past business dealings. Files show that in 2016 she partnered with Epstein in a company called Pyrtanée LLC, which was described as focusing on acquiring works by emerging French artists. \n\n\tShe has said she was introduced to Epstein by Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn in 2012 and characterized her involvement as naïve. She told investigators that she did not invest in or receive funds from the US Virgin Islands–registered company and that its legal and financial structures were handled by Epstein’s lawyers.\n\n\tAs scrutiny intensified, she resigned from her role as managing director of France’s Independent Producer Syndicate and from the board of the TV festival Series Mania.\n\t\n\n\tJack Lang’s stature makes the episode especially striking. As culture minister in the 1980s and early 1990s, he was instrumental in expanding access to the arts and launched the annual Fête de la Musique, now celebrated worldwide. \n\n\tHis leadership at the Institute du Monde Arabe had become part of that legacy, positioning him as a bridge between France and the Arab world. His resignation closes a chapter that stretches back to the early Mitterrand years.\n\n\tLang confirmed to the French press that he had met Epstein years ago and said he was shocked when the financier’s crimes became public. He has framed the relationship as casual and insists he never received funds tied to Epstein’s activities.\n\n\tEpstein embedded himself in the cultural sphere and had myriad connections to the art world. He maintained a personal art collection, engaged with collectors such as Ronald Lauder and Leon Black, and corresponded with figures across museums, universities, and galleries. His network also extended to board members of institutions like the New York Academy of Art and to major donors linked to museums and research centers.\n",

    "body": "\n\tThe face of an angel who appeared to resemble Italy’s right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has been removed from a fresco in a Rome church after complaints from Vatican officials.\n\n\tThe image appeared in a chapel of the Basilica of St. Lawrence in Lucina, where artist Bruno Valentinetti restored a fresco he originally painted in 2000. Valentinetti initially denied that the angel bore any resemblance to Meloni. He said the recent intervention was a necessary conservation effort after water damage, a claim echoed by the parish priest, Monsignor Daniele Michelett, in comments to the BBC.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\n\n\tThe likeness was first reported earlier this month by La Repubblica, which noted that the angel, depicted holding a map of Italy, had previously featured a more generic cherubic face. Speaking to the newspaper on February 5, Valentinetti later acknowledged the resemblance, saying, “Okay, it was Meloni, but along the lines of the painting that was there before.”\n\n\tThe angel’s face was erased last week after Italy’s culture ministry and the diocese of Rome opened an inquiry into the work. The Five Star Movement, a political party opposed to Meloni’s government, weighed in on the controversy, warning that art should not become “a tool for propaganda.”\n\n\tValentinetti said he removed the image at the Vatican’s request. “I covered the face because the Vatican told me to,” he said. “The Curia wanted it that way, and I erased it.” In a statement, the Vicariate of Rome said the angel’s features “did not conform to the original iconography and the sacred context.”\n\n\tItaly’s culture ministry also issued a statement last Wednesday, noting that any further restoration work in the church would require formal authorization from the Religious Buildings Fund of the Interior Ministry, which owns the property. Approval will also be required from the Vicariate and Rome’s Special Superintendency, accompanied by preparatory sketches.\n\n\tMeloni herself addressed the episode with humour, posting on Instagram that she was “definitely not like an angel,” followed by a laughing emoji.\n",

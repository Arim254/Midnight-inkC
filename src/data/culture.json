    "body": "\n\tin History, Technology |   \tJanuary 23rd, 2026  Leave a Comment\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\nThe Renais­sance did not, strict­ly speak­ing, occur in Chi­na. Yet it seems that the Mid­dle King­dom did have its Renais­sance men, so to speak, and in much ear­li­er times at that. We find one such illus­tri­ous fig­ure in the Han dynasty of the first and sec­ond cen­turies: a states­man named Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), who man­aged to dis­tin­guish him­self across a range of fields from math­e­mat­ics to astron­o­my to phi­los­o­phy to poet­ry. His accom­plish­ments in sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gy include invent­ing the first hydraulic armil­lary sphere for observ­ing the heav­ens, improv­ing water clocks with a sec­ondary tank, cal­cu­lat­ing pi fur­ther than it had been in Chi­na to date, and mak­ing dis­cov­er­ies about the nature of the moon. He also, so records show, put togeth­er the first-ever seis­mo­scope, a device for detect­ing earth­quakes.\nA visu­al expla­na­tion of Zhang’s design appears in the Sci­ence­World video above. His seis­mo­scope, its nar­ra­tor says, “was called hòufēng dìdòngyí, which means ‘instru­ment for mea­sur­ing sea­son­al winds and move­ments of the earth,’ ” and it could “deter­mine rough­ly the direc­tion in which an earth­quake occurred.”\nEach of its eight drag­on heads (a com­bi­na­tion of num­ber and crea­ture that, in Chi­na, could hard­ly be more aus­pi­cious) holds a ball; when the ground shook, the drag­on point­ing toward the epi­cen­ter of the quake drops its ball into the mouth of one of the dec­o­ra­tive toads wait­ing below. At one time, as his­to­ry has record­ed, it “detect­ed an earth­quake 650 kilo­me­ters, or 400 miles away, that was­n’t felt at the loca­tion of the seis­mo­scope.”\nNot bad, con­sid­er­ing that nei­ther Zhang nor any­one else had yet heard of tec­ton­ic plates. But as all engi­neers know, prac­ti­cal devices often work just fine even in the absence of com­plete­ly sound the­o­ry. Though no con­tem­po­rary exam­ples of hòufēng dìdòngyí sur­vive from Zhang’s time, “researchers believe that inside the seis­mo­scope were a pen­du­lum, a bronze ball under the pen­du­lum, eight chan­nels, and eight levers that acti­vat­ed the drag­ons’ mouths.” Mov­ing in response to a shock wave, the pen­du­lum would release the ball in the oppo­site direc­tion, which would roll down a chan­nel and release the mouth at the end of it. How­ev­er inno­v­a­tive it was for its time, this scheme could, of course, pro­vide no infor­ma­tion about exact­ly how far away the earth­quake hap­pened, to say noth­ing of pre­dic­tion. For­tu­nate­ly, cen­turies of Renais­sance men still lay ahead to fig­ure all that out.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nHow the Ancient Greeks Invent­ed the First Com­put­er: An Intro­duc­tion to the Antikythera Mech­a­nism (Cir­ca 87 BC)\nThe Advanced Tech­nol­o­gy of Ancient Rome: Auto­mat­ic Doors, Water Clocks, Vend­ing Machines & More\nBehold Col­or Pho­tographs Tak­en Dur­ing the After­math of San Francisco’s Dev­as­tat­ing 1906 Earth­quake\nChina’s 8,000 Ter­ra­cot­ta War­riors: An Ani­mat­ed & Inter­ac­tive Intro­duc­tion to a Great Archae­o­log­i­cal Dis­cov­ery\nWhat Ancient Chi­nese Phi­los­o­phy Can Teach Us About Liv­ing the Good Life Today: Lessons from Harvard’s Pop­u­lar Pro­fes­sor, Michael Puett\nBased in Seoul, Col­in Marshall writes and broad­casts on cities, lan­guage, and cul­ture.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nIn his forthcoming solo exhibition, Building Identities Through Style, Glenn Hardy Jr. excavates the strata of fashion, especially how identities are shaped and perceived through appearance. \nBased in Washington, D.C., Hardy is a self-taught painter whose bold portraits emphasize Black life “liberated from the burdens of racial stereotypes and conflict,” says Charlie James Gallery, which is currently presenting the show. The figures in Hardy’s compositions often engage in everyday leisure activities or settle into places of refuge and camaraderie, like studios, athletic courts, and domestic spaces.\n“Mannequin | Cherry Blossoms” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 40 x 30 inches\nBuilding Identities Through Style emphasizes fashion as more than simply personal expression or “self-celebration,” as described in a statement. Hardy examines the complexities of garments, trends, and luxury through the lens of desire and access, juxtaposing elements of reality and fantasy—especially in a series of paintings of mannequins topped with realistic visages, like individual characters being pieced together as their tailored apparel takes shape.\nThe artist is interested in how sartorial choices nod to complex systems of negotiation and judgment that inform our understanding of conformity, difference, and a sense of belonging. “Hardy not only interrogates the manner in which Black bodies are seen and assessed, but also the ways in which stylistic excellence has become both reputational armor and a source of joy, experimentation, and play,” the gallery says.\n“Soar Thumb,” for example, portrays a group of men in an elevator, all but one of whom are dressed in nearly identical suits and sport short haircuts. The outlier is a tall individual with bold dreadlocks and a white tank top, standing confidently with his arms crossed and gazing directly at the viewer. \n“Soar Thumb” (2025), acrylic on canvas, 36 x 36 inches\nHardy frames the contrast not as an act of rebellion but as a means of parsing how, within a shared space, some find conformity to bring a sense of safety or comfort, while others view individual expression to be—in addition to its liberating nature—a kind of buffer or armor.\n“The suited figures are not antagonists but participants in the same system of social evaluation, using uniformity as protection,” says a statement. “The outlier is neither hero nor foil; he is exposed. The work asks not which presentation is more authentic, but what each form of visibility costs.”\nBuilding Identities Through Style continues through February 7 in Los Angeles.

Traveling to the Okinawa prefecture in the hopes of encountering a scarcely documented species of larval goosefish, Kovacs spent nearly two weeks blackwater diving before photographing the rare moment. \n“Unfortunately, this beautiful little fish turned out to be incredibly uncooperative and difficult to photograph,” Kovacs says. “After spending some time with it, I was very fortunate that, for one brief moment, it decided to yawn while facing the camera.” The resulting image is aptly titled “Tired fish.”\nSteven Kovacs, “Tired Fish,” Kumejima, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan\nThis past year, the annual contest saw thousands of entries spanning more than 90 countries. From silky sharks in Cuba to small pipefish in Indonesia, each photograph highlights unique, fleeting underwater moments that often go unseen. Awardees took home more than $60,000 in prizes, including once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as diving excursions, cruises, and liveaboard trips.\nTake a plunge into the online gallery of winning images, highlighting 14 distinctive categories.

    "body": "\n\n\t\nJoy Machine is thrilled to present World in My Eyes, a duo exhibition of Chicago artists Kayla Mahaffey and Joseph Perez, a.k.a. Sentrock.\nWorld in My Eyes is, first and foremost, rooted in the lives of everyday people. Both Sentrock and Mahaffey have long depicted friends and neighbors in their own Chicago neighborhoods, exploring how our city shapes its youngest residents. How are children cared for? How are their imaginations and dreams nurtured? These questions recur throughout both artists’ practices and always hinge on another: how do children thrive amid turmoil, whether political, cultural, or personal?\nSentrock, “Better days ahead” (2026), spray paint and latex paint on canvas, 36 x 48 inches\nIn World in My Eyes, Sentrock’s signature bird character meets Mahaffey’s energetic cast. Each artist confronts an underlying struggle—whether an unrealized dream or a physical need—not through an unrealistic swaddle of optimism but rather through the often-repeated idea that hope is a practice. For children, and for all of us seeking a better tomorrow, hope starts with courage.\nAn opening reception will be held from 6 to 9 p.m. on January 30. RSVP.

How much has this made a difference? It seemed that personal relationships were more important in the 1980s when I first because knowledgeable of Whitney Biennial through now. (For instance, the article mentions the Sonabend Gallery, and back in the 1980s it seemed that Soho galleries had direct placement rights for the Biennial.) Or have only the methods of communication changed, but not so much the relationships themselves. Perhaps this is anecdotal, but the people I know personally or know about through friends/ family who have been in the Biennial have a natural talent for schmoozing and also work very hard at it, or they have galleries doing this for them. Is there really anybody in the Biennial who hasn't worked very hard at being seen and known as well as at their art?From the ArchiveWorks by Aziz Osman in Anomalous Expansion (photo courtesy Mohamud Mumin)Somali American Artists Create a Space All Their OwnSt. John’s Catholic Church was built in 1922 to serve the growing Irish immigrant parish that was founded in 1887 on the city’s east side. | Sheila Dickinson\n                  \n                      \n                        Daily Newsletter\n                      \n                      \n                        Newsletter\n                      \n                  \n        \n    \n",

(all photo and video used with permission)\n    \n        \n            Two months after its festive opening, the Adjaye Associates-designed Studio Museum in Harlem evacuated visitors today following a messy \"sprinkler emergency\" in its gift shop. The museum will remain closed through the weekend, a spokesperson confirmed.A museum visitor who asked to remain anonymous told Hyperallergic that staff instructed guests to leave the museum this afternoon, January 23, as water poured from the ceiling near the gift shop. “We saw a large pool of water on the floor near the entrance, and saw the water flowing down in the store,\" the visitor said. A spokesperson for the Studio Museum reached by Hyperallergic confirmed that a sprinkler was damaged during preparations for the upcoming storm and cold front, causing a flood in the gift shop below. No artworks or galleries were affected.”Because the incident impacted the adjacent entrance to the building, and in anticipation of the impending storm, the Museum will be closed to the public throughout the weekend,” the spokesperson said.\n            \n                \n                \n                        \n                        0:00\n                            /0:10\n                        \n                        \n            \n            Video of the incident captured by a bystander\n        The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) responded to the incident. The FDNY told Hyperallergic they received a call for a \"sprinkler emergency\" at 2:30 pm on Friday. The incident was resolved by 3 pm, FDNY said, and there were no injuries.Videos captured by bystanders show water raining steadily from the ceiling, including one containing light fixtures. \"I hope nothing is damaging the artwork,\" one person is heard saying. The Studio Museum on January 23, 2026The Studio Museum reopened to the public on November 15 following a seven-year closure and the construction of a new building by Adjaye Associates with Cooper Robertson. (Adjaye was accused of sexual misconduct in 2023 and had since stepped away from the Studio Museum project. He has denied the allegations.) The new 82,000-square-foot building reportedly cost $160 million.Editor’s note 1/23/26 6:40 pm ET: This article was updated with comment from the Studio Museum.\n                  \n                      \n                        News\n                      \n                      \n                        New York\n                      \n                      \n                        Studio Museum\n                      \n                  \n        ",

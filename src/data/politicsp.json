Higgins on Saturday said the Trump administration ending TPS for Venezuelans in early 2025 was \"reckless, dangerous, and wrong.\" She also called for President Trump to \"immediately\" reinstate TPS for Venezuelans.   \n   Miami has a large population of Venezuelan expats. Higgins was sworn in as mayor last month, becoming the first Democrat to lead the city in about three decades.   \"The instability unfolding in Venezuela today makes it even clearer that the country remains unsafe for people to return. No one should be forced back into chaos and uncertainty,\" Higgins wrote in a statement. \"They have built lives here, contributed to our community, and deserve the security to remain while their homeland regains stability. This is not just a matter of policy — it is a matter of basic human dignity and safety.\"   \n   The U.S. Supreme Court in May allowed the Trump administration to temporarily strip legal protections from more than 350,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. under TPS, which protects against deportations and provides work permits to people impacted by war, natural disasters and other circumstances.   \n   In October, the high court granted the administration's request to halt a lower court order that blocked the end of TPS protections for Venezuelans — allowing the administration to move forward with ending the TPS designation for the country.   When asked about Higgins' statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the administration ending the program, saying Sunday that decisions are made in collaboration with the State Department and White House.   \"Every individual that was under TPS has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward, but we need to make sure that our programs actually mean something and that we are following the law,\" Noem said during an interview with Fox News.   The Department of Homeland Security also said in a social media post later on Sunday: \"Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love.\"   At least 7.9 million people have fled Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.\n",

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has called for Edmundo González, to be recognized as the rightful leader of the nation. He was widely seen as the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election in the country.   \n   Who is Machado?   Machado rose to global prominence last year with her win of the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize.   She has been an outspoken critic of Maduro's party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), since it first won power under founder Hugo Chávez in the presidential election of 1998. The Nobel committee recognized Machado for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.\"   Her full-throated criticisms of Maduro's authoritarian regime has earned her the moniker \"Iron Lady\" among her supporters.   \n   Machado has praised President Trump as his administration carries out deadly strikes in the Caribbean Sea against Venezuelan boats he has accused of trafficking drugs.   She dedicated her Nobel Prize to the American president and has repeatedly expressed her support for the United States' pressure campaign against Maduro, citing crumbling political and economic systems within Venezuela that have forced 20% of its residents to flee the country.   \n   Despite her popularity among many Venezuelans, Trump said on Saturday he had not been in contact with Machado since the military strikes in Caracas and that he did not see her as a viable candidate to steer the country.   \"I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country,\" he told reporters during a press conference. \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect to be a leader.\"   Trump said the United States would \"run\" Venezuela until a \"proper transition can take place.\"   Machado on Saturday praised Maduro's capture, writing in a statement that he faces \"international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations.\"   \"Faced with his refusal to accept a negotiated exit, the United States government has fulfilled its promise to uphold the law,\" she wrote.   \n   Machado continued: \"We have fought for years, we have given everything, and it has been worth it. What had to happen is happening.\"   Venezuela held a closely watched presidential election in 2024. Machado was barred by the Maduro regime from running in the race, but she threw her backing behind fellow opposition member González.   International election watchdogs, including the United States, say Maduro manipulated the ballot results in order to steal a third term in office and continue his dictatorial reign.   \n   On Saturday, Machado called for Venezuelans to coalesce around González and recognize him as the legitimate president of the beleaguered nation.   \"Today we are prepared to enforce our mandate and take power. Let us remain vigilant, active, and organized until the Democratic Transition is finalized. A transition that needs ALL of us.\"   Though Machado has dedicated Venezuelan supporters, the former Venezuelan National Assembly legislator has been banned by Maduro's government from running for office and was forced into hiding until a recent escape — aided by U.S. military veterans — successfully extracted her to Europe.\n",

The capture of Maduro and Trump's comments comes at a time when even a country like Venezuela — with one of the biggest oil resources in the world — isn't a sure bet for attracting major oil companies.   \n   Many oil companies have been bruised by their past experiences operating in the country. The global oil market is currently facing an oversupply. Oil prices are below $60 a barrel, and long-term projections for oil demand are unclear as the world shifts to more electric vehicles.   Trump promises to \"run the country\" and make way for U.S. oil companies in Venezuela. However, there's a long history of U.S. interventions in Latin America and the Middle East not going well, oil experts tell NPR.   Here's what you need to know about Venezuela's oil.   Venezuela has huge oil reserves, but now produces a fraction of what it used to   Venezuela was once one of the biggest global oil producers and was one of the main founders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a group of some of the world's biggest oil producers, whose decisions help determine global oil prices. Venezuela has the largest proven reserves of oil in the world, according to OPEC.   But while the country was producing more than 3 million barrels a day a few decades ago, today Venezuela produces only about a million barrels a day, or roughly 1% of global oil output. The U.S. produces about 13 million barrels a day.   \n   Much of Venezuela's oil went to refineries in the U.S. Now much of it goes to China.   Not all crude oil is the same — some oil is physically lighter and easier for refineries to process. Venezuela's oil is heavy and dense, and requires special refineries. Burning any type of oil contributes to climate change, but Venezuela's oil is \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming,\" says Paasha Mahdavi, associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The El Palito refinery rises above Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025.\n                \n                    Matias Delacroix/AP Photo\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matias Delacroix/AP Photo\n    \n\n   \n   Venezuela owes some U.S. oil companies billions   U.S. oil companies like Chevron began drilling in Venezuela about one hundred years ago and played a key role in developing the country's oil sector.   But around 2004 to 2007, then-President Hugo Chávez \"basically forcefully renegotiated contracts\" with international oil companies, says Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University.   ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007 and then took the Venezuelan government to international arbitration courts. The courts ordered Venezuela to pay ConocoPhillips over $10 billion and ExxonMobil over $1 billion. Venezuela has only paid a fraction of those sums to ExxonMobil and to ConocoPhillips.   Chevron, however, stayed in Venezuela — although \" they didn't like it,\" says Gerald Kepes, president of Competitive Energy Strategies, an energy consultancy in Washington, D.C.   Chevron today produces about a quarter of Venezuela's oil.   In response to the news of Maduro's capture, Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne said in an email, \"Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"   Trump has said that Venezuela has \"stolen\" U.S. investment in the country's energy sector.   Will U.S. oil companies return?   Venezuela is what the oil industry calls a \"brownfield\" — meaning it's well established, and oil companies have a fairly good idea of what they will find when they drill. For companies like ConocoPhillips, returning to Venezuela could be an opportunity to recoup some of the billions owed to them by the government, Monaldi says.   \n   In an email, ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss wrote, \"ConocoPhillips is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\"   ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.   Still, this isn't the best time to add to the global oil supply, Monaldi says. There's currently a worldwide glut of oil. Also, because Venezuela's oil is particularly bad for the climate, that makes it less attractive for European oil companies with climate goals, Monaldi says.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Aerial view of a ship at the Demerara river in Georgetown, Guyana on August 29, 2025.\n                \n                    JOAQUIN SARMIENTO/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JOAQUIN SARMIENTO/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Venezuela's neighbor is a rising oil star   Next door to Venezuela is Guyana — a country that recently discovered over 10 billion barrels of oil and is a key emerging player in the international oil industry.   Guyana's oil is lighter than Venezuela's, less polluting, and has lower taxes than Venezuela, Monaldi says. There's also no national oil company in Guyana, as there is in Venezuela.   \"All that makes for Guyana to be one of the most attractive oil places in the world,\" Monaldi says.   While ExxonMobil is no longer in Venezuela, it is a major player in Guyana.   For years, Venezuela and Guyana have had a territorial dispute that has also been related to oil rights. Last March, Venezuelan vessels entered Guyanese territorial waters approaching offshore oil vessels belonging to ExxonMobil.   \"Without a doubt, with a changing regime, Guyana should feel more secure,\" Monaldi says.   Lack of political stability could be a deal breaker    Some increase in Venezuela's oil production could happen fairly quickly with more financial support and improved management, according to an analysis by Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.   But Mahdavi says the Trump administration's plans to jumpstart the industry will be difficult. He notes that it took nearly two decades to revitalize Iraq's oil industry after the U.S. invasion, though corruption and mismanagement remain pervasive.   \n   And ultimately, notes Kepes, if it's unclear who is in charge in Venezuela, oil companies will have concerns about the long-term viability of their contracts. \"No one's going to start investing on the ground in a place where there's no legal contract and viable permission to operate or if there's concerns about political stability and violence,\" he says.\n",

Rubio, who is also President Trump's interim national security adviser, said the U.S. will enforce its influence through an existing \"oil quarantine\" imposed by U.S. naval vessels near the coast of Venezuela.     \n   \"Our military is helping the Coast Guard conduct a law enforcement function, which is not just the capture of Maduro, but the enforcement of our sanctions,\" Rubio said on the program. \"And we think that's just tremendous leverage, incredible crippling leverage, which we intend to continue to use until we see the changes that we need to see.\"    Since September, U.S. forces have struck at least 35 alleged drug boats, killed at least 115 people on board and seized oil tankers near Venezuela.    The comments offer the first glimpse of what U.S. policy toward Venezuela will look like following the weekend raid that captured the country's leader, and Trump's remarks that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela.   Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton, R-Ark., echoed Rubio in calling for a pressure campaign against Maduro's allies who still control the country. Cotton specifically named interim President Delcy Rodríguez, who previously served as vice president under Maduro.   \"They have control of the military and security services,\" Cotton told CNN. \"We have to deal with that fact.\"   During a Sunday interview with The Atlantic magazine, Trump said Rodriguez would \"pay a very big price\" if she didn't cooperate, a day after he claimed that she was on board with the U.S. plans.   \n   The Trump administration's actions over the weekend will likely see the first signs of domestic pushback this week in the form of congressional Democrats.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned Trump for ordering the Saturday military operation without consulting Congress. The administration argues that it didn't need to notify Congress because Maduro was arrested in a law enforcement action. The Venezuelan president will appear before a New York judge Monday.   \"They went inside Venezuela, bombed civilian as well as military places,\" Schumer said. \"And it's a violation of the law to do what they did without getting the authorization of Congress.\"   Schumer said Sunday he plans to hold a vote on a war powers resolution this week that would limit Trump's ability to attack Venezuela without Congressional approval.    \"If it's voted positively in both houses, then the president can't do another thing in Venezuela without the OK of Congress,\" Schumer said.    Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the only GOP member publicly supporting the resolution so far. Unlike other measures, this resolution needs a simple majority to pass the Senate — meaning only three more Republicans would have to support it to advance the measure. It is unclear if the measure has Republican support beyond Paul.\n",

On Saturday, Katie Miller, wife of President Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, posted a picture of the American flag covering Greenland on X. She captioned the photo with the word \"SOON.\"   Then on Sunday, Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic that Greenland could be subject to future U.S. intervention.   \"We do need Greenland, absolutely,\" Trump said. \"We need it for defense.\"   \n   Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Sunday that the U.S. has \"no right to annex\" territories of Denmark and has told the U.S. to \"stop the threats\" about taking over Greenland.   Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark's ambassador to the U.S., responded to Miller's post, saying \"we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"   \"Just a friendly reminder about the U.S. and the Kingdom of Denmark: We are close allies and should continue to work together as such,\" he said.   Greenland has been under Danish control since the early 18th century but was granted home rule in 1979.   Miller's post on Saturday came hours after the U.S. military conducted airstrikes in Venezuela's capital and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Trump said at a press conference that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela until there is a transition of leadership.   Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Greenland from Denmark for its strategic location in the Arctic. He appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as his special envoy to Greenland last month, which sparked diplomatic concerns in Europe.\n",

Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., speaks at a news conference in the Capitol on Dec. 1, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Kelly held the event to address what he described as intimidating actions by President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, following the release of a video in which Kelly and several lawmakers urged U.S. troops to refuse \"illegal orders.\"\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is pledging to fight back after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced he's taking administrative action against Kelly.    Hegseth claims that Kelly's public statements, including a video message telling troops not to follow illegal orders, amount to sedition.   In a statement on social media, the defense secretary said that he's initiated a formal 45 day process to reduce Kelly's rank and retirement pay.   \"In response to Senator Mark Kelly's seditious statements — and his pattern of reckless misconduct — the Department of War is taking administrative action against Captain Mark E. Kelly, USN (Ret),\" Hegseth's statement read.    \n   This administrative action will include review of Kelly's retirement grade, which could result in a change or reduction to his rank \"resulting in a corresponding reduction in retired pay.\"   \n   Hegseth also announced he issued a formal censure letter that will be placed in Kelly's official military file.    In response, Kelly issued a statement, saying he had earned his rank in combat and as an astronaut, and that Hegseth and the Trump administration were trying to stifle free speech and dissent among retired military officers.    \"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head — all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly said.    \"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way. It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that,\" Kelly added.   The Arizona senator said he won't be intimidated by censure or threats to his rank and retirement. He stated he plans to fight the action.     \n   \"I will fight this with everything I've got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.\"   Before serving as a senator, Kelly spent 25 years as a Navy pilot and retired with full military benefits. That status makes him subject to the military code of justice. The Pentagon launched an investigation into Kelly in November. \n",

But the invasion also faces significant skepticism, questions about legality, and full-throated opposition from some elected officials across the political spectrum.     Here's a survey.   Some Republicans condemn, or question, Trump's invasion   While most conservative lawmakers voiced support for Trump's action, a small group of Republican House members and GOP Senators described the move as unlawful or misguided.   \n   \"If the President believes military action against Venezuela is needed, he should make the case and Congress should vote before American lives and treasure are spent on regime change in South America,\" said Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, speaking on the House floor.  \"Do we truly believe that Nicolás Maduro will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington?  How did that work out in Cuba, Libya, Iraq or Syria?\"   \n   Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., posting on social media, voiced skepticism that the true goal of Trump's invasion was to stop the flow of drugs into the United States. She also described the military action as a violation of conservative \"America First\" principles.   \"Americans disgust with our own government's never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going,\" Greene posted on X.  \"This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.\"   Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General, generally praised the military operation, but he also said the precedent of U.S. military intervention could embolden more aggressive action by authoritarian regimes in China and Russia.    \n   \"Freedom and rule of law were defended last night,\" Bacon said on X, referring to the invasion of Venezuela, \"but dictators will try to exploit this to rationalize their selfish objectives.\"   At least three Republican Senators also voiced concern or skepticism about the invasion and its legal justification, while also celebrating the fall of Maduro.    \"In this case, a leader who monopolized central power is removed in an action that monopolizes central power,\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote on the platform X.  \"Best though, not to forget, that our founders limited the executive's power to go to war without Congressional authorization for a reason—to limit the horror of war and limit war to acts of defense.\"    GOP Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both of Alaska, said Maduro's ouster would make the United States and the world safer, but suggested the operation could turn into a quagmire for U.S. troops.    \"Late last year, I voted to proceed to debate on two resolutions that would have terminated the escalation of U.S. military operations against Venezuela absent explicit authorization from Congress,\" Murkowski wrote on the platform X.  She added that she expects further briefings from Trump officials on the \"legal basis for these operations.\"   \"The lessons learned from what took place after the United States deposed another Latin American indicted drug lord—Panama's Manuel Noriega in 1989—could prove useful, as could the painful and difficult lessons learned after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003,\" Sullivan wrote on X.   \n   Most Democrats condemn the invasion   Most Democratic lawmakers and elected officials also described Maduro as a dictator, but they generally condemned Trump's action. At a press conference Saturday, New York City's new Mayor Zohran Mamdani told reporters he phoned Trump and voiced opposition to the invasion.   \"I called the President and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal and international law,\" Mamdani said.   \n   Democratic minority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York accused Trump of acting in bad faith and violating the U.S. Constitution. \"The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans,\" Schumer said in a post on X. \"The American people have seen this before and paid the devastating price.\"   According to Schumer, the Trump administration assured him \"three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or or military action without congressional authorization.\"    California's Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Trump critic, posted a series of comments on X describing Saturday's military action and Trump's proposed U.S. occupation of Venezuela as potentially disastrous.     \"Acting without Congressional approval or the buy-in of the public, Trump risks plunging a hemisphere into chaos and has broken his promise to end wars instead of starting them,\" Schiff wrote.   \"Donald Trump has once again shown his contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law,\" said Vermont's Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a video posted on social media, where he described the U.S. invasion as \"imperialism.\"     \"This is the horrific logic of force that Putin used to justify his brutal attack on Ukraine,\" Sanders said.   \n            Trump campaigned on an “America First” platform. Now he wants to \"run\" Venezuela?60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Health care is collapsing. Housing is unaffordable.Trump should address these major crises at home and end his illegal military adventurism abroad. pic.twitter.com/vyoNpEcn4a— Sen. Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 3, 2026\n   \n   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, also spoke harshly of the military strike, describing it as an effort by Trump to distract attention from domestic troubles in the United States.   \n   \"It's not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn't have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world last month,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to Trump's decision to free former Honduran President Orlando Hernandez, who had been convicted in the U.S. of helping smuggle more than 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S.   \"It's about oil and regime change. And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn't. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs,\" Ocasio-Cortez added on X.\n",

    "body": "\n      We have analysis on President Trump's decision to topple Venezuela's leader, and how it will be viewed by his MAGA supporters.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  The deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro arrived in New York yesterday, where he's expected to face criminal charges. He was captured by U.S. forces during an astonishing military operation in the early hours of Saturday morning in the Venezuelan capital. The commando raid has been condemned by several countries in the region, and here in the U.S., questions have been raised about the legality of the operation. Speaking at a news conference in Mar-a-Lago, President Trump suggested the U.S. could remain in the country as an occupying force.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. So we don't want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years.RASCOE: But the president has offered few details on how that might work in practice. Joining me now to discuss that, and much more, is NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.RASCOE: President Trump was, of course, elected on a platform of America First, and he pledged to stay out of foreign wars. So how do you think his political supporters will view this operation in Venezuela?LIASSON: Yeah. Well, that's the big political question here, and you're right, this is a huge change from what he ran on. And he even said it yesterday in the press conference. He referred to the Monroe Doctrine of the 19th and early 20th century. That's gunboat diplomacy. He said, quote, \"the Monroe Doctrine is a big deal. But we've superseded it by a lot. They now call it the Donroe (ph) Doctrine.\"And the occupation of Iraq and the reaction against that was really what fueled MAGA and fueled the rise of Trump - the reaction against the Iraq War and the occupation. You have the Vice President JD Vance, who actually served in Iraq. He came out of that conflict thinking that America had no business intervening in other nations' problems. So I think the big question for MAGA that Venezuela might answer is, is MAGA what Trump wants on a given day, or is it a set of principles that transcends Donald Trump and focuses on domestic problems in the United States, non-interventionist isolationism?RASCOE: But what will determine whether the overthrow of the Venezuelan president is viewed as success?LIASSON: Well, it's all going to depend on how easy it is to, quote, \"run\" Venezuela. And what does it mean when Donald Trump says he's going to run Venezuela? Is it going to be an occupation like Iraq? The U.S. has intervened in Central America before, in Panama, Haiti, Grenada. Donald Trump says this could involve boots on the ground. But we also know that the U.S. has learned some hard lessons, especially in the Middle East with Iraq, that it's not so easy running countries. And, you know, Venezuela has an army. It has a national guard. It has armed drug gangs. And we don't know how the Venezuelan people will react yet.We did have the first wrinkle yesterday when, in the press conference, Donald Trump referred to the vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, and said, quote, \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great.\" Hours later, Rodríguez goes on TV from Venezuela and demands the immediate release of Maduro and his wife and says there's only one president of Venezuela, President Maduro. So she doesn't sound as cooperative as Donald Trump described her.RASCOE: Now, some top congressional Republicans have praised President Trump for this military action, but several Democrats are questioning whether the president had the legal authority to intervene without congressional approval. What have you been hearing?LIASSON: Right. Well, I think that most Republicans, as you said, are supportive of this move. You have the two MAGA apostates, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie, members of Congress, criticizing this, saying that Donald Trump should be focused on domestic problems like the price of health care and food. But Democrats want hearings. They want to exercise Congress' constitutional prerogative to approve or disapprove foreign interventions. But I don't think you're going to get big pushback from this Republican Congress on Venezuela.RASCOE: It's been a really dramatic start to the year, and this is a year that could prove pivotal to the president's fortunes because the midterms are in November. What do you think are likely to be the big issues in the coming months?LIASSON: Well, the two things I'm watching are the economy and the Supreme Court. On the economy, GDP seems to be doing very well, but you can't eat GDP, and prices are still high. We have a K-shaped recovery. That means the rich are doing pretty well. Middle-class and lower-income people are struggling.And then you've got the Supreme Court, where they're going to decide on birthright citizenship, a huge case. The 14th Amendment guarantees anyone who's born on U.S. soil to be a citizen. Donald Trump wants to change that. They're going to rule on tariffs and on the Voting Rights Act, which, if they gut it, that would allow Republicans to draw even more districts that are favorable to them in the midterms.RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, about the Trump administration's military operation in Venezuela.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Now, President Trump acted in Venezuela without the approval of Congress, asserting that no such approval was needed. Lawmakers now decide how, if at all, to respond. And one of them is Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, good morning.JIM HIMES: Good morning.INSKEEP: I was home in Indiana when this strike took place over the weekend, and people in my family said, well, obviously, they can't get permission of Congress in advance in a case like this. It would leak. And I said, well, there is this Gang of Eight, eight top lawmakers, and normally the administration would keep them informed. You're one of the Gang of Eight. Were you informed?HIMES: No. No. In fact, you know, I was woken up by my wife who said, you won't believe what's happening. And to this moment, I have actually not received any outreach at all from the administration. So, look, the decision was taken here, and this whole leak thing is baloney. I don't think the Gang of Eight has ever leaked. But this, you know, obviously, very inconsistent with the idea that Congress has a role to play, when the - you know, probably the role to play when the United States military is engaged. And as a political matter, you know, a little unwise 'cause it's hard to imagine this adventure going, you know, horribly right in the coming months. And, you know, because he - the president did this without any input from anybody else, he owns this 100% now.INSKEEP: Why do you think that there's not a good chance that this could go right?HIMES: Well, point to me in the last generation one incident - one instance of the United States effecting regime change and having everything go well. You just can't, right? You can point to Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya. In some ways, the best, I think, the administration can hope for is a sort of a Grenada situation where, you know, no one sort of people lose track because, I mean, who remembers Grenada back in the early '80s, right? That's the best-case scenario, especially when it's completely evident at this point that the president has no plan. He says we're running Venezuela, but apparently, that means we've got a lot of firepower off the coast and are trying to get the vice president very much a Chavista leader, very much part of the old regime, to do what we want because we've got a lot of guns.INSKEEP: Let me talk that through with you, though. You point out that nation building has not worked well at all for the United States, given the risks of trying to create some brand-new government or install the opposition leader as president, could the U.S. be wise to leave the current government in place and just give some orders?HIMES: Well, that would probably be wise - well, it would certainly be wiser than putting the 50,000 armed forces on the ground that would be required to effect a full regime change. You know, and then, of course, you know, there's all sorts of questions of what happens with the Venezuelan military - a lot of guns there. Huge political risk for the president, right? I mean, President Biden's administration never recovered from the visual image of 12 Marines dying at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan. So huge risk. But, you know, you have to remember the Venezuelan regime has its politics, too. It can't be perceived as a puppet of the American administration, which quite explicitly says it wants their oil. So this is going to be, I think, a lot harder than Donald Trump thinks that it will be.INSKEEP: What should the role be for the opposition, the president-elect, according to the United States, the man who won the election in 2024, or María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner who is the opposition leader?HIMES: Well, that was the fascinating thing to me about the news conference, right? The president said two things that I think probably fatally damaged this adventure. On the one hand, he did something that Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz at their neocon peak would never have done, which is to say this is about oil. I mean, you have to understand how that sounds to Venezuelans and to the rest of the world. This is not about our democracy or our prosperity. It's about the United States taking the oil. And secondly, the president delegitimized probably the single unifying force in Venezuela in the form of Mrs. Machado, who won a Nobel Peace Prize. The president cut the ground out from under her. So, you know, now Venezuelans are thinking, wait a minute, do I get to live with this appalling regime, but now United States gets the oil? You know, I mean, this is just - the president, I think, probably fatally wounded whatever chance this effort had in saying those two things in his news conference.INSKEEP: Briefly, what will your approach be now that the president is also threatening the leader of Colombia and talking again about taking over Greenland, among other things?HIMES: Well, you know, clearly, Congress needs to do something that it has not done because it's been under the control of the president's acolytes for the last, you know, year or so, which is to assert itself, to say we are the legitimate representatives of the people, and you're now talking about using those people on foreign adventures that would have made Teddy Roosevelt blush. So, you know, again, we're in the minority in the House and the Senate, but it is time for this Congress to stand up and say we have a role to play here.INSKEEP: Jim Himes of Connecticut is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, thanks so much.HIMES: Thank you. Take care.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A hard pinch and a cup of coffee later, and reality set in. But questions remain.   So what does this mean politically, and what should Americans make of what happened?   Here are some takeaways as the dust settles on Caracas:   1. It was an audacious and surprising move for a president who campaigned against American intervention.    Donald Trump, the \"America First\" candidate and president, has turned out to be rather hawkish. In less than 12 months in office this second time around, he's conducted strikes in seven countries — Iran, Nigeria, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and, this weekend, oversaw a daring middle-of-the-night raid in Venezuela. U.S. forces captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, sending them to New York to stand trial for drug trafficking.   \n   To call the action surprising and eye-opening doesn't quite do it justice, especially considering Trump made his bones in opposition to neoconservatives' \"endless wars\" and nation-building in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.   On Saturday, Trump said the United States is going to \"run\" the country until he finds a suitable leader.   \"Well, we're gonna be running it with a group,\" Trump said, \"and we're gonna make sure it's run properly.\"   He noted that \"people that are standing right behind me\" are going to run it. That included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.   Rubio on Sunday tried to walk that back some, describing what the U.S. is doing as a \"quarantine,\" meant to effect \"policy.\"   \n   2. Like Iraq, there have been shifting justifications for removing Maduro.    As the United States was about to commit to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein from Iraq 20-plus years ago now, the Bush administration made different arguments and justifications for intervention that seemed to shift like the sand of the Middle East.   Was it that Saddam Hussein was funding the kinds of terrorists who were responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks? Was it getting rid of a dictator who didn't align with American values? Was it creating a democracy that could be a model for the rest of the Middle East to follow? Or was it that he had weapons of mass destruction that he couldn't be allowed to keep before they resulted in a \"mushroom cloud,\" as then-President George W. Bush warned in 2002?   \n   In the case of Maduro, is it regime change because of a dictator who again doesn't align with American values, combating drug trafficking, leveraging oil or some version of all of the above? Each of those has had their moments as the justification for the Trump administration's saber-rattling.   During Saturday's news conference, Trump stressed oil as a key motivator. He said American oil companies would be going in and modernizing the country's oil production and refinement capabilities. He said the companies would invest billions and \"use that money in Venezuela.\" He said that the \"biggest beneficiary are going to be the people of Venezuela\" and Venezuelan ex-pats in the U.S. It's unclear how that would be managed.   \n   Trump has a long history of saying the United States should \"take the oil.\"   \"You're not stealing anything,\" Trump said of taking oil from Iraq in a 2011 interview with ABC. \"We're reimbursing ourselves.\"   Fast-forward to 2023, when Trump was out of office, talking about Venezuela.   \"We're buying oil from Venezuela,\" Trump said during an event in North Carolina. \"When I left, Venezuela was ready to collapse. We would have taken it over. We would have gotten all that oil. It would have been right next door. But now we're buying oil from Venezuela, so we're making a dictator very rich. Can you believe this? Nobody can believe it.\"   On Sunday, the administration was out in full force defending its actions, pinning the reasoning on drugs, primarily. The White House has repeatedly claimed to be stemming the flow of fentanyl by striking alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, despite the fact that fentanyl isn't largely produced in Venezuela.   Vice President Vance, who has been a vocal critic of U.S. intervention abroad in other cases, took on that critique on social media.   \n   \"[C]ocaine, which is the main drug trafficked out of Venezuela, is a profit center for all of the Latin America cartels,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"If you cut out the money from cocaine (or even reduce it) you substantially weaken the cartels overall. Also, cocaine is bad too!\"   He noted that \"a lot of fentanyl is coming out of Mexico,\" a reason that Trump \"shut down the border.\" That raises questions about what's next, too.   \n   Vance also referenced the oil: \"I understand the anxiety over the use of military force, but are we just supposed to allow a communist to steal our stuff in our hemisphere and do nothing?\"   Rubio, meanwhile, said that this was a law enforcement action to recover fugitives, because of a 2020 indictment of Maduro for the trafficking of cocaine. That, by the way, seems to be part of the administration's rationale for not seeking authorization from Congress.   These explanations are likely more politically palatable to the MAGA base than saying the United States is at war with Venezuela or, as Trump said, that the United States is now running another country — with no clear goals for an exit.   3. Speaking of Rubio, this action certainly seems to point to his increased influence with Trump.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump, CIA Director John Ratcliffe (left) and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (right) monitor U.S. military operations in Venezuela, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club on Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla.\n                \n                    Molly Riley/The White House via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Molly Riley/The White House via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, has always been more hawkish than Trump on foreign policy, particularly when it comes to Latin America.   During this Venezuela operation, Trump seems to be leaning on Rubio. Rubio was a central figure in the administration's announcement on Saturday and did the rounds on the Sunday shows to defend the action.   \n   In this second term, Rubio has taken on quite a few roles. After the hollowing out of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, Trump made him director of that program, as well as acting archivist of the National Archives, he's Trump's acting national security adviser and the secretary of state, which is also fourth in line to the presidency.   It's all evidence of how far Rubio has come to be able to burrow into Trump's inner circle. That's quite the turnabout from the bitter campaign a decade ago when Rubio was likening Trump to \"third world strongmen\" and a \"con artist\" with \"small hands,\" while Trump was dismissing him as \"Little Marco.\"   \n   4. Right-wing authoritarians are OK, but left-wing dictators are not?   Trump referred to Maduro as a \"dictator\" four times during his news conference Saturday (an \"outlaw dictator,\" \"illegitimate dictator,\" \"now-deposed dictator\" and \"dictator and terrorist\").   But there are lots of other dictators, authoritarians and strongmen in the rest of the world, many of whom Trump has praised through the years.   \n   Trump has allied himself with people like Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Argentina's Javier Milei, rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, seems deferential to Russia's Vladimir Putin, and, during his first term, made overtures to North Korea's Kim Jong Un.   Couldn't there be justifications for those leaders' overthrow, too, that an American administration could come up with, following Trump's logic?   It's not a far leap to suggest the difference is politics (and oil).   5. Don't expect MAGA to abandon Trump.    Yes, there's undoubtedly an irony in Trump campaigning against intervention and what he's done in Venezuela. There will be — and already are — voices of opposition in Trump's base.   But dedication to Trump among the faithful runs deep — and there's an entire conservative media infrastructure built to insulate him and give the base talking points.   It started in the early moments Saturday morning after the raid. On Fox News, for example, panelists were pointing to Democrats' arguments of the move being illegal as something to mock and knock down. They focused instead on how few in Venezuela were defending Maduro and on the 2020 indictment against him. One network legal analyst said essentially that Trump's action shows that the long arm of American justice doesn't end at U.S. borders.   Given the hyper-partisan ways in which Americans take in their news, don't expect any sort of a wholesale abandonment of Trump. It's more likely to become a rallying point.    \n   Republicans were already tilting toward action in Venezuela before what happened this weekend. A Quinnipiac University poll from December found, overall, that 63% of people said they were against military action in Venezuela. That included 68% of independents. But 52% of Republicans were in favor.   Plus, remember, this is a group of voters that has a lot of practice with being in favor of a tough, hawkish approach to foreign policy. (See: war, Iraq.) The Republican Party, for decades, was held together by a three-legged stool of fiscal conservatism, cultural conservatism and a hawkish foreign policy.   \n   Trump's approach to economics and foreign policy bucked that tradition and seemed to saw off two of those legs, making for some uncomfortable compromises for the GOP, while culture was the main thing gluing together the MAGA coalition.   So, going back to a hawkish foreign policy seems not that far removed from what the Republican Party has been.   6. Democrats have to be careful with their messaging.   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries disputed Rubio's insistence that the U.S. actions were \"not an invasion\" on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.   \"This was not simply a counter-narcotics operation,\" Jeffries said. \"It was an act of war. It involved, of course, the Delta Force. ... We have to make sure when we return to Washington, D.C., [after the holiday recess] that legislative action is taken to ensure that no further military steps occur absent explicit congressional approval.\"   But solely focusing on the legality of the move could be a political pitfall for Democrats. Trump and Republicans are very good at trying to put Democrats in a position of seemingly defending drug dealers and bad people.   Remember, the reason Democrats did well electorally in 2025 is because of the economy, specifically the cost of living. If they do well in 2026, it will likely again be because of that — not whether Trump's incursion into Venezuela was legal or violated international norms, as crassly political as that sounds.   \n   Still, Democrats can't ignore Venezuela and solely focus on affordability, either. They might point out the apparent hypocrisy of ousting Maduro because of drugs while pardoning the former head of Honduras, who was convicted of drug trafficking.   They could also pivot to how this is a distraction from the fact that many people are struggling to buy groceries, homes and health care.   It's about \"surfacing Republican priorities,\" said one Democratic strategist, who asked to remain anonymous because of their role with an outside group.   \n   \"They're more focused on making warfare than fixing health care,\" the strategist said.   7. The real test of the politics of this will be with what comes next.   Americans, including Trump and Vance, have been skeptical of U.S. foreign intervention not because the U.S. military can't pull off regime changes but because of what happens on Day 2 and beyond.   Trump was asked Saturday about the United States' \"mixed track record of ousting dictators without necessarily a plan for what comes afterwards.\"   The president gave a nonspecific and incongruous answer.   \n   \"Well, that's why we have different presidents, but with me, that's not true,\" he said. \"With me, we've had a perfect track record of winning.\"   He went on to cite his administration's 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, the former leader of Iran's Quds Force, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former ISIS leader. Neither of them was a head of state. He also talked about the U.S. bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities last year.   But Trump did not lay out the plan for what comes next for Venezuela or his foreign policy.   This is the president's most vulnerable point politically in this second term. He is facing his worst approval ratings, is going to be 80 in June and is inching closer to politically irrelevant lame-duck status.   So it might not be surprising that Trump would try to stay in the headlines, like with this Venezuela action, and shift attention away from other, more negative issues for him politically.\n",

KFF, the nonpartisan health policy research organization, polled voters about Trump's statements the day after he made them.</p>   <p>\"What we see is that it's hugely divided among partisans,\" says Ashley Kirzinger, the associate director of polling for KFF. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/\" target=\"_blank\">The poll found</a> 59% of Democrats believed President Trump's statements about Tylenol were \"definitely false.\" On the other hand, an almost equal percentage of Republicans — 56% — believed the claim to be either \"definitely true\" or \"probably true.\"</p>   \n   <p>There is no scientific research showing a causal link between acetaminophen and autism. But during an unusual press conference last month, Trump told pregnant women to \"tough it out\" and avoid taking the popular pain reliever. Physicians groups, meanwhile, continue to reiterate that it is the safest medicine to take in pregnancy, when untreated fever or pain can cause other problems.</p>   \n   <p>The poll, which also asked voters about other topics, offers a window into how dramatically public opinion has changed, along with federal health policies.</p>   <p>The poll found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seen a precipitous decline in public trust — most recently among Democrats, as the Trump administration works to dismantle many of its mandates. Kirzinger notes a 24% decline in trust in the CDC's vaccine information among Democrats, just in the past two years. </p>   <p>\"The problem is the mistrust is caused by these very people who are ostensibly leading us,\" former Surgeon General  Richard Carmona tells NPR. Carmona, who served under President George W. Bush, is one of six former surgeons general who recently penned an op-ed in The Washington Post warning that Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. represents a \"threat\" to the nation's health. \"They've dismantled the agencies that had real scientists who provided information, and instead replaced it with ideology,\" Carmona says. \"We're already seeing diseases that we usually don't see coming back, like measles. People will die, and the ramifications are significant.\"</p>   \n   <p>Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, writes in a statement to NPR, \"The polling released by KFF identifies a lack of trust in public heath institutions which predates Secretary Kennedy's tenure. The secretary remains committed to rebuilding public trust in HHS and its entities through transparency and gold standard science.\"</p>   <p>Kirzinger says polls historically have consistently found that people trust their doctors the most when it comes to getting advice about their own health. But increasingly — and especially after the appointment of Kennedy as Trump's health secretary — she says party lines are more critical in determining what sources of information people rely on as the basis for their health decisions. \"Among Republicans, RFK is as trusted ... as their own health care provider,\" Kirzinger says the data shows.</p>   <p>And yet overall, Kennedy's job approval rating ranks low; the poll also found 59% of people — mainly Democrats and independents — disapproved.</p>   <p>Kirzinger says that as faith in federal health agencies declines, people are turning to very different sources.</p>   <p>Democrats say they're relying on professional medical groups, like the American Medical Association. \"More than 8 in 10 Democrats say that they trust the AMA or the American Academy of Pediatrics, but among Republicans, it's only about half,\" Kirzinger says.</p>   <p>What this means is the landscape of public health is very fragmented, and people are making choices based on very disparate beliefs. \"As people are going to different sources of information to make decisions around their health care, we're going to see partisanship playing a big role in what people decide to do,\" she says.<br /></p>\n</div>",

Just at the moment, this thing called democracy – democratic republic is important,\" Addams said with a laugh during an interview.</p>   <p>Addams is the co-executive director of Mormon Women for Ethical Government – known as MWEG. The group is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that is now forcing lawmakers to redistrict Utah's four congressional seats.</p>   <p>Addams spoke in her Salt Lake City suburban home. She was joined by one of the individual plaintiffs in the case, MWEG member Vicki Reid, who sees the suit as in keeping with her faith as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think the one thing that comes to my mind is a hymn that we have which has, \"'Do what is right, let the consequences follow,'\" she said.</p>   <p>The sheet music for the hymn is on Addams' piano. The consequences are playing out this week in the Utah Legislature and maybe soon across the country.</p>   <h3 id=\"The\">The redistricting comes amid Trump's battle for the U.S. House</h3>   <p>Under a court order prompted by the lawsuit, the legislature on Monday passed a new district map that improves Democrats' chances of winning a House seat in the heavily Republican state next year. The map still has to be reviewed by a judge.</p>   <p>This comes as President Trump has set off a national redistricting race by pushing Republican states to redistrict and help their party maintain its hold on Congress. Trump has decried the court's ruling, saying Utahns should be \"outraged at their activist judiciary.\"</p>   <p>While Utah's Republican lawmakers are abiding by the court, they aren't happy about it. Republican State Rep. Candice Pierucci said in an interview that lawmakers better represent the state than the plaintiffs \"that have their own donor groups and their own members that they are beholden to.\"</p>   <p>\"They do not report back to the voters of Utah,\" she said.</p>   \n   <p>Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade when the census results come in. But Trump has gotten lawmakers in Texas and Missouri to redistrict for the benefit of Republican candidates. Other states could follow.</p>   <h3 id=\"MWEG\">MWEG's involvement came before the Trump redistricting race</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4358x2743+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F9d%2F2939c27b4c1faf9e23f8a177306a%2Fgroup-photo.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Eyi, Vicki Reid and Emma Petty Addams of Mormon Women for Ethical Government in Addams' home.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Laura Eyi, Vicki Reid and Emma Petty Addams of Mormon Women for Ethical Government in Addams' home.\n                <b>\n                    Saige Miller/NPR\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Saige Miller/NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>MWEG has been working on redistricting for years. The group says it formed in 2017 amid \"dehumanizing behavior\" in government, and claims some 9,000 members across the country. Most are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Addams said about 40 percent are Republicans – including herself – and 34 percent are Democrats. The rest are independents or in third parties.</p>   <p>Laura Eyi, the group's public relations manager, acknowledges members often don't agree with each other, but their religion keeps them connected.</p>   <p>\"As members of the church step up to get engaged in their communities and in politics in general, they're going to do so in a way that honors the dignity of the person that they disagree with,\" Eyi said. \"That really comes from a place of faith.\"</p>   <p>They tend to focus on the democratic process and that brought them to redistricting.</p>   <p>\"In states like Texas and other places, it's a partisan fight. It's between Democrats and R's,\" Addams explained. \"Here in Utah, it is a cross-partisan, principled effort to try to put forth the best version of representative government we can possibly have.\"</p>   <p>In 2018, Utah voters backed the formation of an independent commission to do the state's redistricting. It was part of an effort to minimize partisan gerrymandering that carves up seats to the benefit of one party or another.</p>   <p>But Utah's Republican supermajority Legislature, instead, took back redistricting power, largely nullifying the ballot initiative. Lawmakers then passed a map that split Salt Lake County - the most Democratic area - into four other Congressional districts.</p>   <p>MWEG, the League of Women Voters and the individual plaintiffs sued in 2022, leading a Utah district court judge to rule the Legislature had overstepped its authority and ordering the redistricting now.</p>   \n   <h3 id=\"The\">The latest district map will go back before a judge</h3>   <p>Reid, a member of MWEG who identifies as a moderate Republican, joined the suit with her Democratic husband.</p>   <p>\"Yes, Utah's a red state. That means that in a red state, more than 50% of the people voted for fair maps,\" Reid said. \"The Legislature has a responsibility to listen to people. And that just wasn't happening.\"</p>   <p>Currently, Republicans hold all four House seats. Republicans dispute that the state constitution allows voters to directly rule on redistricting. \"The Utah Constitution gives the sole responsibility and power to draw maps with the state legislature, period,\" Pierucci told NPR. They vow to take the case to higher courts if needed.</p>   <p>For now, though, the map passed by the Legislature this week will go back before the judge for review. MWEG and the other plaintiffs will be allowed to weigh in. Addams says the lawmakers still didn't meet the non-partisan requirements set out by voters.</p>   <p>\"MWEG joins thousands of Utahns who expressed comments in opposition to the legislature's partisan gerrymandered map that violates those requirements,\" Addams told NPR in a statement.<br /></p>\n</div>",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional. </p>   <p>The two Democrats also say<strong> </strong>it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.</p>   <p>\"The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,\" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. \"It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.\"</p>   <p>Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.</p>   \n   <p>Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529382/rubio-warns-cartels-as-u-s-strike-on-venezuelan-boat-raises-regional-unease\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a new unease in the region</u></a>. But the Trump<strong> </strong>administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.</p>   <p>The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.</p>   <p>Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.</p>   <p>\"A room full of people from the administration,\" Kaine told reporters. Yet \"no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.\"</p>   <p>Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.</p>   <p>It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., about the government shutdown and the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> For more on all this, we turn now to Illinois senior Democratic senator and the Democratic whip Dick Durbin. Good morning, Senator. And thank you for being on the program.</p><p>DICK DURBIN: Good morning. Good to be with you.</p><p>FADEL: So it's Day 9 of the shutdown. Senator, is there a way out at this point?</p><p>DURBIN: There certainly is. And it's an obvious way out. And that is to have both sides sit down at the table immediately and find out ways, find ways to deal with the challenge that faces us. Millions of American families are going to see their health care costs double if Congress doesn't act immediately, and I think that has to be done. October 27 is the date for Illinois when they'll announce the new hospitalization premiums. On average, we expect those premiums to double, particularly for those people who are under the Affordable Care Act, healthcare.gov. And you think to yourself, well, who could they be? Twenty-five percent are farmers. Fifty percent of those who are small businesses. It's many, many families as well. So it's an issue that is becoming very real to a lot of people.</p><p>FADEL: I want to ask - I mean, the key thing you said there is people need to sit down and talk to each other. And what we seem to be seeing is real deadlock. Both parties, your party and the Republican Party, very dug in. Have you seen Republicans or the president showing any willingness to compromise and negotiate with your party and members of your party?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, first things first. I think the speaker of the House, Mr. Johnson, should call the Congress back to Washington. He has told them to stay home now for two straight weeks while we have been meeting here in Washington. That doesn't create an atmosphere of negotiation. I think I know exactly why he doesn't want them back. If they speak to one another among those in the Republican Caucus and talk about the impact that this health care cost increase is going to have on families, there's going to be some people that are going to break away from the party loyally - party loyalty. So I think that's the reason he's told them to stay home.</p><p>FADEL: Are you seeing your Republicans in the Senate breaking away from their party?</p><p>DURBIN: Not many. A few of them are talking, but nothing has materialized yet.</p><p>FADEL: In an interview with Punchbowl News, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, quote, \"every day gets better for us.\" Do you agree with that assessment? And if so, why?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, it's better in one respect. And I know what Chuck was saying. What we're finding is that overwhelmingly, voters agree that we should do something about these health care costs and do it immediately. Don't put it off for weeks or months, as Republicans suggest. But I certainly am sensitive to the impact of the government not functioning, too. That's something that unfortunately is part of this conversation.</p><p>FADEL: Now, the Republicans are branding this shutdown as something brought to you by the Democrats. We saw it on government websites. It's on the comment line when you call the White House. Is that working, blaming your party for this deadlock?</p><p>DURBIN: No, it isn't. And that's another reason Mr. Johnson doesn't want to call the House Republicans back in. The numbers are cratering for the Republicans on this issue. People across the board are saying do something about this cost, which is going to be dramatic if nothing is done. Families are struggling, you know, with groceries and utility bills, and health care costs are dramatically increasing in many states.</p><p>FADEL: I want to shift topics here because National Guard troops have now been deployed to a training facility just outside Chicago, the nation's third largest city in the state you represent. The president has also federalized 300 Illinois National Guard troops. What is your understanding of what comes next?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, I don't know what comes next because I've joined Senator Duckworth in repeatedly asking the Trump administration to explain to us what the purpose of this is and what they're achieving. They have refused to have any conversation. No accountability. And that troubles me greatly. I just say to people who are observing from the outside, as the president goes around saying that we have a terrible situation, a dangerous situation in Illinois, the leading business...</p><p>FADEL: Yeah, he's actually referred to it as a war zone.</p><p>DURBIN: Well, of course he does. He does that kind of hyperbole all the time. But I want to make it clear, the leading business organizations in Illinois have come out against sending in these National Guard troops. It is an image which is not good for business, not good for our future and doesn't reflect the reality on the ground. Yes, we have a crime rate, but virtually every city has some. But we've had dramatic increases - I should say, dramatic decreases in violent crime. And we're on the right track. It would be helpful if the Trump administration would continue to provide the resources to our police department and others who are working to reduce that crime rate.</p><p>FADEL: Now, the numbers back that up. Crime is down in Chicago. But yesterday on the Senate floor, you called the Trump administration's troop deployment, quote, \"a threat to our republic and Constitution.\" What do you mean by that?</p><p>DURBIN: I hope that your listeners paid attention on September 30 with the South Shore apartment building raid that took place. That is hard to imagine, that that took place in America. Three hundred ICE officers in the middle of the night coming in on Black Hawk helicopters, ransacking, breaking down the doors of apartments, bringing the families out for interrogation. Kids with zip ties on their hands, holding them back. And it isn't as if this was some hellhole that they identified ahead of time. For the most part, they didn't know who was inside the building. They alleged afterwards, oh, it was gang activity, but no evidence whatsoever. That kind of experience, it doesn't sound like America to me. It doesn't sound like an agency that's following the Constitution or even cares about human dignity.</p><p>FADEL: You've also said that you would do anything to hold this administration accountable. I mean, how do you plan to do that? Because Republicans control the House, the Senate and the executive.</p><p>DURBIN: Well, it's going to be difficult. I know that. But I'll tell you, public sentiment is not on the side of the president. They realize that he is creating these scenarios in his mind that don't reflect the reality of the moment. Thank goodness many courts are stepping up. There's an important hearing in Chicago today. There was an important ruling yesterday that said, basically, these agencies, ICE and others have to follow the law. They're not doing so in many instances. And it's an outrage what they're doing to innocent families.</p><p>FADEL: That's Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. Senator, thank you for your time.</p><p>DURBIN: Good to be with you.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF SNAAP'S \"WINE\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Now, lawmakers have already held six failed votes and today's seventh attempt is expected to go the same way.</p><p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> With no end in sight, leaders on Capitol Hill have been locked in a war of words. Here's House Speaker Mike Johnson opening his press conference at the Capitol yesterday.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)</p><p>MIKE JOHNSON: Welcome, everyone, to Day 8 of the Democrat shutdown.</p><p>FADEL: On the opposite side of the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says pressure is building on the GOP on subsidies for health care.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER: Our Republican colleagues - House, Senate, White House - are feeling the heat.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh is following all of this. So, Deirdre, Day 9 of the...</p><p>DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Right.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: ...Shutdown. So let's talk about strategies at play. Republicans control Congress. How are they approaching this?</p><p>WALSH: Well, Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune both have been arguing that Republicans have a plan to fund the government. And they say Democrats just keep blocking that bill because of pressure from their base, that they're just playing politics. These leaders say no deal can happen on health care without Democrats helping to pass a bill to end this shutdown.</p><p>Thune has said that some of his own members do want to address these tax credits expiring at the end of the year. That issue has really become the central sticking point in this fight. And he says Congress can debate that, but he says no talks until the government reopens. Speaker Johnson says he's not even planning to call the House back to Washington until Senate Democrats help Republicans fund the government. But on health care, it's worth noting that the speaker really faces a lot of resistance from conservatives in the House who are against any bill to extend these Obamacare subsidies. That's really going to complicate getting a deal.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And as far as the Democrats go, I mean, they really only have one game plan with no wiggle room.</p><p>WALSH: You are right. I mean, they want this debate to be all about health care costs. They admit they really don't have much leverage because they're in the minority, but they think this really high-profile fight gives them a platform on an issue they argue the public is with them on. Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries continue to say over and over again that really the country is worried about rising costs. And they point out that health care costs are the main ones that are - could be spiking in coming weeks if Congress doesn't address health care problems.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Are there any lawmakers cracking maybe, maybe breaking from their leadership?</p><p>WALSH: You know, Democrats I talked to are really largely united. That's a big difference from when this fight happened back in March. There are a few exceptions of lawmakers who have been voting with Republicans, but that group has not been growing yet. Most Democrats say these threats from the president about not paying furloughed federal workers or canceling projects in blue states just aren't working. They say, look, the Trump administration was already firing people, cutting government programs. That would happen with or without a shutdown.</p><p>Republicans, for their part, are pretty united, too. They just keep saying, look, we voted to keep the government open. But we are seeing some cracks, a big one - notable one - from Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene. She is now publicly criticizing her own leadership for not having a plan to address rising health care costs, and she says her own adult children, their costs are going to double.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Any path at all, do you see, to ending the shutdown?</p><p>WALSH: You know, I think the pressure has to come from outside Washington with people feeling the impacts. We're already seeing airport delays. There's another concern coming up with the military not getting paid. That paycheck that they could miss is on October 15. There is a bipartisan group of senators trying to find this compromise on health care. I think a combination of outside pressure and maybe some more details on that deal is a key to unlocking a way out.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks.</p><p>WALSH: Thanks, A.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The committee says the award goes to the person or organization that has done the most \"for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.\"</p>   <p>Trump has received multiple nominations and has never made a secret of his desire to win the prestigious accolade. And, as the first phase of his <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/08/g-s1-92558/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas\" target=\"_blank\">Gaza peace plan</a> makes headway, the focus on the prospect of him winning is intensifying.</p>   \n   <p>Here's what to know ahead of this year's announcement.</p>   <h3>How did the peace prize come about? </h3>   <p>In his 1895 will, Swedish inventor and businessman <a href=\"https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/nobel-peace-prize/history/alfred-nobel-s-will\" target=\"_blank\">Alfred Nobel</a> declared his fortune should be divided into five parts to honor outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for work in peace.</p>   <p>The first prizes were given in 1901 and are now announced every October and awarded in a ceremony in December. In 1968, a new prize was established — the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/\" target=\"_blank\">Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences</a>.</p>   \n   <p>Thousands of people can choose to nominate a person or organization as a candidate for the peace prize, though you cannot nominate yourself. Those eligible to nominate a candidate include members of national governments, officials with international peace organizations, university professors and former recipients.</p>   \n   <p>The recipients of four of the prizes are decided by a Swedish committee, while the recipient of the peace prize is decided by a Norwegian committee composed of five members appointed by the Norwegian parliament. The peace prize committee deliberates in secret for months before coming up with a shortlist and narrowing it down to pick the winner.</p>   <p>The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize receives a medal and about $1.17 million in prize money.</p>   <h3>Who has won it in the past?</h3>   <p>Some of the world's most famous names have won in the past, including former South African presidents Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk in 1993 for bringing a peaceful end to apartheid and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964 for his nonviolent civil rights struggle. Mother Theresa, the Dalai Lama and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/10/15/355160473/what-will-malalas-nobel-peace-prize-mean-for-girls-education\">Malala Yousafzai</a> are also all past winners.</p>   \n   <p>The prize has also gone to people or groups that are not household names. Last year it was awarded to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/nx-s1-5148728/2024-nobel-peace-prize\" target=\"_blank\">Nihon Hidankyo</a>, a Japanese grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>   <p>The awarding of the prize has also courted controversy. Former U.S. Secretary of State <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/nobel-peace-prize-henry-kissinger-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Kissinger</a> received the prize in 1973 along with North Vietnam's chief communist negotiator, Le Duc Tho, for establishing the Paris Peace Accords — which led to America's exit from the Vietnam War. Tho declined the award, but the decision to award Kissinger <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/henry-kissinger-nobel-prize-winning-warmonger\" target=\"_blank\">shocked many</a> of his critics who saw him as a warmonger.</p>   \n   <p>Also controversial was President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/09/nobel-peace-prize-barack-obama\" target=\"_blank\">Barack Obama's</a> Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, just months into his first term. Some criticized the decision, saying the president hadn't had time to prove himself. Ethiopian Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/11/769191358/nobel-peace-prize-goes-to-ethiopias-prime-minister\" target=\"_blank\">Abiy Ahmed received</a> the award for efforts to reach peace with neighboring Eritrea in 2019. He later went on to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/29/939902460/nobel-peace-prize-winner-to-belligerent-warmaker-ethiopia-under-abiy-ahmed\" target=\"_blank\">wage a brutal war</a> in Ethiopia's northernmost region of Tigray.</p>   \n   <p>Leaders in the Americas, including Costa Rica and Colombia, as well as human rights defenders in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have also won the award.</p>   <h3>Who is nominated this time?</h3>   <p>There are 338 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize this year — 244 individuals and 94 organizations.</p>   <p>At the center of intense speculation about this year's award is President Trump, who is currently engaged in negotiations to end the war in Gaza. </p>   <p>The Nobel website does not list the candidates, although some of the nominators have told the media who they've put forward. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have both confirmed they nominated Trump.</p>   \n   <p>Trump has  repeatedly said he deserves the prize, saying he's ended multiple wars this year already, although fact-checkers <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/aug/05/donald-trump/stopped-six-wars-ceasefires-iran-israel/\" target=\"_blank\">dispute the claim</a> as several conflicts he has attempted to end remain ongoing. Earlier this year <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/could-trump-win-the-nobel-peace-prize-and-who-else-could-get-it-13447068\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> at the White House: \"They will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.\"</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251008-trump-unlikely-to-win-nobel-peace-prize-but-who-will\" target=\"_blank\">Other names</a> making the rounds as possible winners this year include Sudan's Emergency Response Rooms, a volunteer network helping civilians despite great risk in the midst of the country's civil war, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/19/1232436671/alexei-navalny-widow-youtube-video-russia-opposition-putin\" target=\"_blank\">Yulia Navalnaya</a>, the widow of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.</p>   <p>In terms of the likelihood of Trump winning, the Gaza ceasefire may come too late to change the outcome of this year's award, and the committee is known to value sustained peace efforts over quick political wins.</p>   <p>However, as of Thursday morning, bookmakers' odds had Trump and the Sudanese group as the joint favorites, according to <a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/insight/tv/20251009-nobel-peace-prize-2025-donald-trumps-odds-slashed-to-win-award\" target=\"_blank\">Oddschecker</a>.</p>\n</div>",

That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.</p>   <p>The precious metal is usually seen as a \"safe haven\" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5559644\" target=\"_blank\">upending global trade</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546737/federal-reserve-lowers-rates-but-less-than-trump-wants\" target=\"_blank\">threatening the independence</a> of the Federal Reserve.</p>   <p>On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/27/nx-s1-5476238/trump-stocks-market-economy-tariffs-businesses\" target=\"_blank\">shrugged off</a> this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.</p>   \n   <p>But at the same time, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/nx-s1-5455867/trump-dollar-value-debt-currency\" target=\"_blank\">value of the U.S. dollar</a> has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.</p>   <p>\"Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,\" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.</p>   <p>\"Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,\" he added.</p>   \n   <p>Now gold is having its hottest year in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-price-rising-61bc0b52?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjkkoi2BpknO3ZOMaUwwi6vmt7lj-z1Tl4_NDR6--08ACeCcWHG1pJkzJZKzo8%3D&gaa_ts=68e6775c&gaa_sig=FKzg7UrdbCjUFUreTRv-s-N_TeN2TfQE836TGp3Yih__yjBdrC5noEUbfhBrpUdwF3gypMAwk-M-XD_QjUkuIQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">nearly half a century</a> — since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.</p>   <p>And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-10-07-2025/card/goldman-sachs-sees-gold-hitting-4-900-by-late-next-year-5C5R6Hg99KpPEwFAIp9A?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgYIFR5-kM9iOVkfCkdM9sDgwXTZeP07lbLG1HVcYzDeoqvm6RVAFg2ozqQHNI%3D&gaa_ts=68e68059&gaa_sig=FCbcMigVK9TkvA6mr3zN6qfUDTBHvX80kHaT7dpJD0R8l16yk-7jIrPcnEHWilk1tUGcv9JxIS-O9L8K8GgBqw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">predicted</a> that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.</p>   <p>Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls \"upside risk\").</p>   <p>\"While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,\" Struyven says</p>   <h3>Gold may be known as a \"safe haven\" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it</h3>   <p>Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the \"fear trade.\" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.</p>   \n   <p>\"When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,\" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/01/nx-s1-5347985/gold-prices-record-highs-tariffs-trump\" target=\"_blank\">told NPR this spring</a>.</p>   <p>But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.</p>   \n   <p>There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.</p>   <p>For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.</p>   <p>More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.</p>   <p>\"Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,\" he says. \"Diversification matters.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n    <p>TONYA MOSLEY, HOST: </p><p> This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)</p><p>TINA KOTEK: To put military troops in American cities is a threat to our democracy. If you think about the speech that the president gave to the hundreds of generals that were gathered a week or so ago to talk about training our troops in the cities of America, we're not at war with ourselves here. There is not an insurrection or a rebellion not only in Portland or Chicago or other places. Look, there are challenges. There's lawful demonstrations. Local law enforcement is handling the situation. And I think this is an overreaction to the situation, and it's just not true. Facts should matter.</p><p>MOSLEY: That was Oregon governor Tina Kotek on NPR reacting to President Donald Trump's order to deploy national guard troops into several U.S. cities. Her words capture the anxiety and disbelief reverberating through many city halls and state houses and even inside the Pentagon. In Portland, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the guard's arrival. In Chicago, city and state leaders are suing to stop similar deployments. But that resistance is falling largely along partisan lines. While Democratic governors oppose the deployments, some Republican governors are welcoming them. Louisiana governor Jeff Landry requested up to 1,000 troops for New Orleans and Shreveport and Baton Rouge, citing high crime rates. And at least six Republican-led states, including West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio, have sent hundreds of guard troops to Washington, D.C., at Trump's request. But the deployment orders are just one part of a larger shift happening inside of the military itself. Last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered what's being described as one of the most politicized military addresses in modern history.</p><p>Speaking to about 800 generals, admirals and senior leaders, Hegseth called for reshaping the armed forces around a warrior ethos and suggested the military must be ready for domestic urban operations. He rejected what he called woke weakness. My guest today is Nancy Youssef, a national security staff writer with The Atlantic. She's been reporting on the reaction inside the Pentagon to Hegseth's speech and what this moment means for civil military relations in America. Prior to joining The Atlantic, Youssef covered the military and the Arab world for The Wall Street Journal. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>Nancy Youssef, welcome to FRESH AIR.</p><p>NANCY YOUSSEF: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy, President Trump has been deploying National Guard troops from states like Texas to cities like Chicago and Portland and others. And these deployments, as we know, have faced legal challenges from federal judges and lawsuits from state officials. Can you bring us up to speed on where this stands and help us understand what's happening?</p><p>YOUSSEF: Sure. I should begin by describing sort of what the National Guard does and under what authority they can deploy. Most National Guard answer to governors, and their job is to respond to demands within that state under the authority of the governor. So you might think of it or seen it as National Guardsmen responding to natural disasters - hurricanes, tornadoes, other natural disasters within their state. They might get support from nearby states, but all of those guardsmen are under the deployment of a governor. And then there are instances where the National Guard can be federalized, which means that they are under the authority of the federal government. The most sort of common one that we would think of is when they are deployed overseas because they are needed to sort of supplement the active duty component. We saw this both in Iraq and Afghanistan. What the president is doing is he is federalizing troops in these cities over the objections of the governor. And so by doing so, he is limited in terms of where he can deploy them because the governor hasn't signed off on them. So they're going to federal buildings because that's under the federal government, and they are escorting ICE agents around on some missions.</p><p>MOSLEY: I want to ask you some questions about some of the rhetoric from the president's deputy chief of staff, Steven Miller, because I think we can't overstate some of the language being used. He is describing what's happening in Portland as a terrorist assault - an organized terrorist attack on federal officers. As you have said, many local leaders and governors are saying that's just not true. In Oregon, the Oregon governor actually says the protests are so small, they just span a city block. Tell me first what role Miller is playing here and what his rhetoric might tell us about where this could be heading.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Well, based on my reporting, I think he is someone who's a proponent of using military force in cities that he sees it as a necessity and that he believes that the president has wide authorities to deploy them into American cities because the threat as he sees them as domestic terrorists and he's described it widely, what constitutes a threat to the United States. What's interesting is not only the language that you pointed out, but in a tweet over the weekend, he said that the Portland local authorities are unwilling to protect these areas. And the reason that's important is the use of the Insurrection Act can happen when local governments are unable or unwilling to protect streets. And so I think that raised a lot of eyebrows here in Washington. Was he laying the groundwork for potentially invoking the Insurrection Act to an American city, to Portland or somewhere else? And the president made reference to it earlier this week and said he could invoke it but didn't have an immediate plan to but certainly suggested that that was something he would consider doing.</p><p>MOSLEY: I actually want us to hear his words directly. So this was President Trump when asked about the Insurrection Act during a White House press briefing on Monday. Let's listen.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd do it if it was necessary. So far, it hasn't been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I'd do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that. I mean, I want to make sure that people aren't killed. We have to make sure that our cities are safe. And it's turning out - and we started with D.C. It's been so successful. Think of it. People wouldn't go to restaurants. The restaurants were closing. We were losing a lot of restaurants, as you all know. And now restaurants are opening, and they're thriving.</p><p>MOSLEY: That was President Trump being asked about the Insurrection Act. Walk us through the legal chess game in this instance because we know that the deployment of National Guardsmen up to this point, using that other statue that you brought up, is being contested in the courts. How likely could something like invoking the Insurrection Act be a reality?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I think, frankly, it could be because the legal language around it gives wide discretion to the president. The Insurrection Act, it gives the president the power to federalize National Guard troops anywhere in the United States to restore order during an insurrection, during some catastrophic, major breach of security in the country. And that hasn't happened yet, but there has been increased talk about it. The president has described what's happening in Portland, for example, as an insurrection, but hasn't provided evidence to support that. And, in fact, the local government says that they are able to maintain order, that they haven't made any arrests and that they don't need federal troops at federal buildings, and they certainly don't need the use of the Insurrection Act in their city. The reason I think there's a lot of concern about the use of the Insurrection Act is that has been used for extraordinary circumstances. It's been used less than 30 times across the history of this country. I think the time that we think about it that most listeners might be familiar with was in 1992 after the riots in response to the Rodney King trial. And so that was an extraordinary circumstance. And I think the concern is that if this is allowed to proceed, that it will lower the threshold for when the federal government can put military troops on American streets, that it's no longer for extraordinary circumstances but ones that fall far short of that.</p><p>MOSLEY: Have you heard anything about how these deployments are sitting with the National Guardsmen themselves?</p><p>YOUSSEF: It's funny. When you talk to them, there's a whole wide spectrum of responses. You'll have people who are really frustrated, for example, in Washington because some missed the first days of school with their children during this deployment. Some of them are feeling the stress in their own homes, in their own communities, in their own businesses. Then there are some who are delighted to be a part of this mission and that they see themselves as defending the nation's capital, that they're carrying out the president's mission.</p><p>We did a story with National Guardsmen, and one thing that jumped out to me is that when we ask them, what is your mission or the president's mission? - which was an interesting use of language to me because some might see themselves as really carrying out the vision of the use of National Guard as the president wants it. But that's different from a guard that often, up until that point, really largely defined themselves as protecting their communities or protecting the nation.</p><p>MOSLEY: ...The nation.</p><p>Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\")</p><p>MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR, and today we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>So, Nancy, all of this - the deployments, the legal battles, the rhetoric about the enemies within - it all connects back to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's speech last week, where he told military leaders, about 800 generals and admirals from around the world on short notice - and basically told them that the old military is over. And I want us to listen to just a bit of it.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PETE HEGSETH: This administration has done a great deal from Day 1 to remove the social justice, politically correct and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department, to rip out the politics. No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship. No more division, distraction or gender delusions. No more debris. As I've said before and will say again, we are done with that [expletive]. I've made it my mission to uproot the obvious distractions that made us less capable and less lethal. That said, the War Department requires the next step. Underneath the woke garbage is a deeper problem and a more important problem that we are fixing and fixing fast. Common sense is back at the White House. So making the necessary changes is actually pretty straightforward.</p><p>MOSLEY: That was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on September 30 at a Marine Corps base in Virginia. Nancy, beyond what he actually said, what we just heard, what made that gathering itself so unusual?</p><p>YOUSSEF: A couple things. I've been covering the Pentagon, and I was in Iraq and Afghanistan before that, so since 2003, and I've never seen a gathering of all generals and admirals. I mean, logistically, it's such a challenge. There were admirals who had to be pulled off of ships and then flown from ship to shore and then from shore to Washington for this gathering. And they arrived not knowing what the purpose of the meeting was. Some were asking themselves privately, what would I do if I was asked to take a loyalty test, for example? Some were telling their staffs I'm - what they would or wouldn't do in those situations. Some were trying to protect their staffs. And so usually, you would not gather that many because - and this sounds flip - they're busy. These guys are busy and they're busy on important missions, and they're supporting troops on the front line. And then to not know why sort of created a - I think, a climate of fear in the run-up to it.</p><p>And then during the conversation - you know, usually, secretaries of defense in the past have focused on sort of thinking about fighting the next war, the future of the military 10 or 20 years. And what they heard from Hegseth was a lot of focus on things that usually don't come from a secretary in terms of the priorities - fitness and social programs. Usually, those are things that are reserved for lower-ranking officers. It was, to me, a speech that was sort of an extension of his book in which he argues a lot of these same points, and those views and that book was based on his experience as a National Guard major. And so I think a lot of those in the room heard a message that this secretary of defense wants a very different force. I think if you're a woman - and we heard from women who kind of kept hearing if there's going to be same standards across, and then they want to be judged for what they do. You know, he said repeatedly, we have to - sort of suggests that there have been lower standards for women. There haven't been.</p><p>And I think the message that the generals heard more than anything was - I mean, frankly, a lot of them joked that they kind of got lectured by a major. But they didn't hear something that sort of was unifying, but really looking for ways to narrow the definition of what makes an exceptional soldier, sailor, airman or Marine. Up until this point, I think the military really celebrated exceptional Americans of different backgrounds, different races, different genders. And the secretary really kind of narrowed that definition to a certain kind of troop, a certain kind of American with certain views. And I think that was the message that came across more than any other.</p><p>MOSLEY: That's really interesting about how they said they felt like they were being lectured by a major because, of course, in the military, hierarchy is super important. Many of those people in the room have more experience than Hegseth. What are you hearing from both rank-and-file service members afterwards? When they were able to talk about it and parse out, what was the takeaway for them to go back to their bases and places? Like, what did they interpret as the directive?</p><p>YOUSSEF: The thing I hear more than anything is sort of fear about what they can say, what they can do, what they cannot do. For some in the room, I think they wondered if they were being sort of personally targeted in some way, that they wouldn't be welcome in a military that they spent decades serving.</p><p>MOSLEY: Because many of them are those identities. They are women. They are people of color.</p><p>YOUSSEF: And they got there because of their qualifications. This assumption that there was some sort of favor done to let them in, you know, in many ways, the military - and I'm not saying that it's perfect, but it is a meritocracy. It is harder for women and people of color to advance in this military. I don't want to oversimplify it. But there's a lot of meritocracy in that system as well. And there has been efforts over time to make sure that that is more in place, not less so. I did a story a few years ago with a general who was trying to interview future colonels and put them behind a screen so that those evaluating them couldn't see them, that they could remove identifying factors so that you could really judge rising colonels based on their merits. So there have been efforts to get at this. The other interesting thing that happened is there was such an awareness about the message they were sending with their response.</p><p>If you'll remember, in June, President Trump came to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. And there were lower ranking troops there who were cheering when he was mocking President Biden, who were buying Trump merchandise that was being sold nearby and putting it on their uniforms. And there was such an awareness that how they reacted was going to send a message to the force and to the country, that they see themselves as an apolitical force and that they are there to defend the nation, and that they're there not to only defend certain causes or certain parts of the country or against certain threats. And so there was a real awareness about reactions, which is why you didn't see any. I think they were trying to send a message to the country, but also to lower ranking troops, that this is the expectation in terms of how you respond, that we remain America's military and we are here to defend the nation.</p><p>MOSLEY: I mean, just thinking about some of those initiatives that really have been part of the fabric of the military for several decades. If you're a woman in the military right now or LGBTQ, a person of color, where do you turn at this moment if you face discrimination? Have the headwinds turned pretty quickly? What are you hearing?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I'm hearing people really consider whether they can stay and also what to tell people coming up behind them, whether they should encourage them to stay in because they don't know. I mean, in that speech, the secretary also said, you know, people are accused of bullying too often and that we need to reassess that sort of standard, that we're not going to ruin people's careers over minor infractions but then was quite vague about what a minor infraction was. Which for some people, these were a lot of the checks that were put in place to make sure that there's an equal opportunity, to make sure that people are protected - that if they, for example, complain of sexual harassment that it won't be career-ending for the person who was harassed but for the person who did the harassment.</p><p>And so what I hear from a lot of people is a question about whether they can continue to serve. Now, having said that, there are people both in that room and certainly across the force who saw that message as important and necessary, that too much time had been taken, focused on social issues and not enough on war fighting, that the military needs to get back to a standard, that it needs to be more focused on physical fitness. So for some people, it resonated that the force had gotten too off of mark of its priorities. For others, though, I think particularly for women and minorities that I've spoken to, there's a feeling that maybe I'm not welcome here anymore. And I've had service members tell me that directly, really asking themselves, is there a place for me in this military going forward?</p><p>MOSLEY: You know, the timing is striking because I was also reading that there has been, over the last few years, a steady uptick of particularly Black recruitment and Hispanic recruitment under the military's DEI policies. Is there kind of the bet that Hegseth can attract more recruits from a conservative base that might be turned off by diversity? And does that math actually work when there has been a struggle in the past to find qualified people to enlist?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I think it depends on what kind of military you see in the future. If you see a smaller military, if you see one that doesn't need to represent, sort of in terms of its physical composition, the American population - it doesn't fully now, right? The middle of the country is where the majority of service members come from. But if that's the goal then this becomes harder.</p><p>If the goal is a smaller military, one that sort of is more homogenous in terms of values - where they're more focused on internal threats, where we don't have as many troops in Europe or in the Middle East, where we're depending more on drones and other technology and less so on having a physical foot presence in those areas - then it might work. And I think that's the ultimate question. What kind of military do they see? They're hinting at it, but they haven't spelled it out.</p><p>MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. Our guest today is Nancy Youssef, national security writer for The Atlantic. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF WAYNE HORVITZ'S \"IN FIELDS THEY LAY\")</p><p>MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And today, I'm talking with Nancy Youssef, national security writer for The Atlantic. She's been reporting on the fallout from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent remarks and what they potentially signal about the future of the U.S. military and its relationship to American democracy. Youssef has covered national security and the military for two decades, reporting in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Pentagon. Her latest story explores how senior military leaders are interpreting this moment and what it could mean for civil military relations in the United States. Youssef has also worked for The Wall Street Journal and McClatchy newspapers. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>You know, something that Hegseth referred to - he referred to the time period of the 1990s almost as some sort of golden age. And there's a lot of change that was happening back then, but I also wanted to note that women first flew combat missions in the '90s. But then there was also Don't Ask, Don't Tell as a policy. So what version of the '90s does he want to return to?</p><p>YOUSSEF: He didn't say in this speech. He said, we'll just pick a year. He mentioned General Schwarzkopf as a kind of general that the U.S. military should be like. I think he sort of suggested because that was the last major military win and referring to the Gulf War. I mean, the thing is, though, you know, one year after that period was the Tailhook scandal in which 70-plus women and seven men were sexually harassed and assaulted at a convention. Generals had tried to complain about this conference and the behavior that happened there in the years prior and were ignored. A lot of the reforms that we have in place now were a product of the mistakes of that period.</p><p>Moreover, the idea that the 1990 war was sort of the metric, you could argue that the U.S. had to - didn't finish that war. And one of the reasons that you saw the U.S. intervention ramp up afterwards in the Middle East was because of sort of the consequences of that war. And so he seemed to suggest that it was a time when you had fewer women, you had fewer restrictions. But just scratch below the surface, it was not a time that everybody could serve and serve in an environment that they felt that was safe and fair to them.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy, Hegseth isn't just changing who's in the military and what they do. He's also controlling who military leaders can even talk to. So you reported on this back in July. Tell us what happened with the Aspen Security Forum. And it might actually help for you to go over exactly what is the Aspen Security Forum and then tell us what happened.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Sure. This is part of a broader restriction that the secretary's putting on generals, admirals, civilians to talk about what the Pentagon is doing. So military officers go to maybe hundreds of conferences across the services a year, and one reason they go is to show the American public who they are, to engage, to have conversations, to hear ideas from different places. And there's one that's held every year, every summer in July called the Aspen Security Institute, and it's sort of one of the bigger ones where you see a lot of four stars going. They meet with top policymakers, and that's really an opportunity to have sort of a broad discussion about national security.</p><p>Immediately before that conference was supposed to begin, the secretary issued guidance that essentially said that those generals and admirals couldn't go, that there would be restrictions on what they could go to going forward and that they needed approval from the department before they go to such conferences in the future. And so you had people, in some cases, getting ready to board flights who had to cancel their plans because they were not allowed to go to something that has been really a staple in terms of formats where there can be discussions outside of the Pentagon about national security. And I've gone to several of them, and I do find that often when you're in Washington, you know, you end up looking at things from where you sit, and that there are so many opportunities at those kinds of forums to just hear different thoughts or get a sense in terms of how national security policy is being received outside of the building. And so I think that's why so many agree to do it. And so now you're seeing far fewer generals and admirals going to such events and even lower ranking, for that matter, and that those that they are allowed to go to tend to be organizations that are perceived to have a political affiliation or agreement with the administration, which hadn't happened historically in the past.</p><p>MOSLEY: Can you briefly just go a little bit deeper on the value of these events for these military officials? Because I just want to get a clear understanding of what could potentially happen when you cut the Pentagon off from those types of events.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Well, you know, only a small, small percentage of Americans even serve in the military. So even though it gets nearly a trillion now of taxpayer dollars, I think a lot of people don't understand the military. They haven't been exposed to it in a way that gives them a real understanding of what the military does. And sometimes these formats offer opportunities for the military to introduce themselves to the American public.</p><p>In addition, so many of these events that they go to, there are people who are doing work that might on the face of it not seem relevant or useful to the military. But they might introduce the military to new technologies where interest can overlap, where they can sort of advance a technology because they're seeing it used somewhere else. Sometimes it's meeting officers from other countries and seeing how they're tackling a threat versus how the United States is tackling a threat. Sometimes it's just the face-to-face meeting to get to know somebody so that in the future, if there is some sort of conflict and you need to be able to get somebody on the phone, you've had that face-to-face interaction that can be the difference between the right and the wrong response to a crisis.</p><p>And so it's just an opportunity for real discourse that their jobs usually don't allow. They're often so immersed in the problem set in front of them and around other military officers, around like-minded thinkers that the opportunity to get outside of that and think outside of that. And how each side can bring lessons and experiences to the other has - from the cheap seats where I sit, has been beneficial.</p><p>MOSLEY: Well, let's talk a little bit about the cheap seats where you sit, your job. In September, Hegseth told Pentagon reporters, sign this pledge. Don't report anything, even unclassified information, without our approval. Now The New York Times is reporting that those rules have been relaxed. What's actually going on?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So...</p><p>MOSLEY: And how has your job been impacted?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I don't see the rules as loosened. Well, let me begin by saying what the rules were. So we've had a wonderful opportunity as Pentagon reporters in that we could walk most of the building. Now, that doesn't mean we could go into secure rooms or go into areas. There are many, many, many secure areas, most of them. But you could walk and hear and get a sense of how headquarters, the mood of headquarters as it was contemplating these decisions. And so it's been an enormous resource for us.</p><p>Now, having said that, it's also been to the great benefit of the Pentagon, because the Pentagon had never let us in as a favor to us, but they understood that if you're going to ask for such an enormous amount of money, and for American families to volunteer their sons and daughters to serve, that they had an obligation and actually a benefit in showing the American public what was being done with that money, the decision-makers behind it. It's why they did embeds, for example, when they allowed us the experience of being in the Humvee with them and experiencing what we as a country were asking them to do.</p><p>And so this has been the case since the Pentagon opened in 1943, through many wars, through many tense moments between the press and the Department of Defense. In May, we were told we could only walk through certain hallways. And now they set new rules that in order for us to continue to be in the building, they have to sign off on what we ask - not publish, ask - that the mere solicitation of information unapproved could lead to us being kicked out of the building. So for example, if I were to...</p><p>MOSLEY: Right, I was going to say, yes, how did that work?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I don't know. Let's say I ask someone, where is the USS Truman operating in? What ocean? That's a violation because it wasn't sort of through the channels as they spell them out. And I should note, this wasn't brought about because there was some egregious security violation, there weas some breach that happened, there was some threat to national security that demanded some change. This has been part of a consistent message from the secretary that he doesn't want the military engaging with mainstream press, for lack of a better term. That he wants to engage directly on social media and only speak to those who sort of are like-minded in their views of his conduct.</p><p>He doesn't do regular interviews. You know, up until this point, and certainly during the wars, we had secretaries and chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff who regularly came into the brief room and answered questions. That doesn't happen anymore. There aren't regular briefings. It's so hard to get basic information now. And once we're out of the building, if that's what happens, it'll be even harder. And I worry about the chilling effect because the messaging is, you, general officers, you, leadership, don't have to engage. You don't owe anybody answers to such consequential decisions that you're making.</p><p>MOSLEY: You're worried about the chilling effect. But, I mean, isn't this also a violation of the First Amendment? Doesn't this run into First Amendment problems?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So here's what the Pentagon would say. You can keep reporting. You just can't do it from the building. You just can't have access to the building. So therefore, we're not violating your First Amendment right. Now, does that go with the spirit of the First Amendment, the spirit of this country? I would argue, no, that we have encouraged a robust conversation about policies and demanded answers of the leaders making them. So that's the way that they're arguing in terms of the First Amendment right, because they have the discretion over who comes into the building. But it's not clear whether we can still go to any military installation. And does it create sort of two tiers, those who agree and those who don't?</p><p>MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF THE AMERICAN ANALOG SET SONG, \"WEATHER REPORT\")</p><p>MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, we're talking with Nancy Youssef, national security staff writer for The Atlantic. Our interview was recorded yesterday.</p><p>Nancy, I want to talk just a little bit about how the military is now operating outside of the country. There was this incident that happened back in September in the Caribbean. Trump announced the U.S. Navy struck a boat from Venezuela, killing 11 people who were aboard that boat. There have been more strikes since then. I think there are more than 20 people who have died. What is the latest that you know about that situation?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So it's a great question because it is an unprecedented use of military force against drug traffickers. So the administration has said that they want to use the military to combat drug trafficking, and that they have named some narco trafficking groups as foreign terrorist organizations. When they describe those on these boats, they use language that we used to reserve for al-Qaida and ISIS, calling them combatants and saying that...</p><p>MOSLEY: Unlawful combatants, yes.</p><p>YOUSSEF: That's right, which we hadn't - you know, you think of that more for groups like al-Qaida. And that they need to strike these boats to stop the flow of drugs into the United States. The problem is we don't actually know, nor have they told us in any detail, who's on these boats, why striking these boats in particular combats that problem. The president has described fentanyl as the drug that he wants to stop from entering the United States. Well, fentanyl doesn't come from Venezuela. There are countries that are trafficking more drugs than Venezuela by a lot. Venezuela is more for transiting drugs. But Colombia, Mexico, if we're going after a drug problem, it would seem like those are the countries one would target more.</p><p>And it's not clear how hitting these boats, even if they have drugs on them, has an enduring impact on drug trafficking in the United States, nor has the administration described it. Secretary Hegseth has put out on social media this is protecting the American people. but I'm not sure that it's clear how. If this is truly about going after drugs and using the military for something that had been reserved for law enforcement - and you would bring in the Coast Guard in a law enforcement capacity as part of that. If we're going to turn that now into a military mission, it's not clear why now, why these targets, what the end state looks like and whether it is legal to go after drug traffickers, because the foreign terrorist designation in and of itself doesn't legally justify it. Again, we haven't gotten any clarity from the administration. Earlier this week, Pam Bondi was on Capitol Hill and asked about the legal justification and said she wouldn't answer it. We've heard from the administration that this is a new, better use of the U.S. military, that we're going to focus on threats in the Western Hemisphere, that this is a threat to the United States. But I don't know that there's been a clear line drawn between these specific strikes and that threat.</p><p>The other interesting thing to me is, you know, this idea of going after non-state actors. This has faced legal questions than before - with al-Qaida, the courts had some questions at the beginning about it and said because they are seeking to destroy the United States, they can be considered a threat that should be dealt with militarily. These drug traffickers have not said that. Their aim is not to destroy the United States. Their aim is profit. And so it's not clear to me legally how these strikes are being justified. They are because they're still happening, but we haven't heard more of an explanation. What we have heard the administration say is that more of these strikes are coming.</p><p>MOSLEY: You're actually - you've been doing some reporting on this. What are some things that you're looking at and watching for?</p><p>YOUSSEF: So what's interesting to me is why the administration has chosen this to use U.S. military force on. I mean, these are the most aggressive strikes happening by the U.S. military from anywhere that I can say. I mean, we've had strikes against Iran and against the Houthis in Yemen, but right now this is the most aggressive military campaign.</p><p>And I think there's a Venn diagram of sort of interest happening where you have people like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been a long advocate of opposition in Venezuela, who want to see the Maduro government fall. It's an illegitimate government by the United States' standards, stayed in power even after election deemed otherwise. There are people like Stephen Miller and JD Vance who I think see this as a way to project power. They see it as a form of deterrence against drug traffickers, that even if they're not the sort of ones that are posing the biggest threat, that the hope is that drug traffickers will see this and take from it that they shouldn't be sending drugs into the United States. And then there's the president himself who has indicated that he wants to use the U.S. military in different ways, who sees these strikes as a way to sort of have an influence on the world stage. And it's hard to push back, I think, for some because the administration will say you're defending drug traffickers. So the sort of questions around these strikes, I think, are harder for some who oppose them to make.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy, you've covered the Pentagon for decades. How would you characterize this moment?</p><p>YOUSSEF: I think it's a potential inflection point in terms of the use of U.S. military force, what we constitute as a threat, how big we want the military to be, what we want it to look like. The decisions that are being made now will reshape the military for many years. It takes years to kind of train an officer, to build an ethos within the force. And, like, the changes can happen very quickly, but the consequences of them will take years to play out. And I think we're at this point where there's a real question about what is the U.S. military here for now? What kind of threats do we consider a priority? What is our relationship with our allies? What can they count on us for? There's a lot of changes happening. And to be clear, there are some people who welcome those changes. But it is an important inflection point for a military that has really projected itself as the leading defenders of the rule-based order and a certain moral view on how foreign policy should be conducted.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy Youssef, thank you so much.</p><p>YOUSSEF: Thank you.</p><p>MOSLEY: Nancy Youssef, national security correspondent for The Atlantic.

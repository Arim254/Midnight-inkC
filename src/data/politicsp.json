But under Acting Director Russell Vought, the CFPB is refusing to accept money from the Fed.    The CFPB argues that the law that established the agency says it must get funding from the Fed's \"combined earnings,\" or profits made by the Fed.  But the Fed doesn't have those earnings, the Trump administration says, because it's paying out more money than it's taking in, or operating at a loss.    \n   The attorneys general suing the administration — and some Democratic lawmakers — reject that argument. They say the CFPB is narrowly defining \"combined earnings\" as profits, whereas lawmakers had intended the term to mean the wider funds — or proceeds — coming into the Fed.   In their suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Oregon,  the states argue Vought and CFPB are using \"an unreasonable and unlawful interpretation of 'combined earnings.'\" The agency's stance puts the \"CFPB at risk of losing all of its funding as early as January 2026,\" the states argue.   Such a loss of funding would hurt their residents, the attorney generals argue.   In a statement, New York Attorney General Letitia James — who is leading the coalition of states — argues that the CFPB is legally required to \"collect and process consumer complaints and share that complaint data with states,\" which the agency can't do if it isn't funded.    \"Defunding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will make it harder to stop predatory lenders, scammers, and other bad actors from taking advantage of New Yorkers,\" James said in the statement.     \"My office and attorneys general across the country rely on the CFPB for consumer complaints and other data to get justice for consumers,\" she added.    \n   Under the Trump administration, much of the CFPB has been gutted, with the agency preventing many of its staff from doing their work. The administration also has tried to fire most of the CFPB's staff, though those attempts have been blocked by the courts.   Since its creation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has been the target of many conservatives. They argue the agency is too aggressive when it comes to enforcement and that it's not accountable enough to Congress.\n",

Clad in an all-black dress jacket and shirt, the immigrant — who was identified only by the number of his case — swears that his last immigration notice was lost in the mail.   The judge tells him to check his mail regularly, ahead of his next appearance in January.   As the room empties out, the judge says out loud that there are a number of no-shows that day. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, attorney in court files motions to remove five people \"in absentia.\" The judge grants it. Those people can now be deported.   \n   A similar scene has played out, and increasingly so, in nearly every immigration court nationwide over the past year, according to immigration attorneys and NPR's early analysis of court data. The results mirror those of Joseph Gunther, an independent researcher, who has also been tracking the data closely. More immigrants are not showing up for their mandatory immigration court hearings, allowing the government to order their immediate deportation.   \"What happened is that the word spread that if you go to court, you could get picked up from ICE,\" said Ruby Powers, an immigration lawyer based in Texas with cases all over the country.   In 2025, ICE turned to arrests directly from federal or immigration courtrooms in order to meet arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.   \"Those instances weren't consistent around the country, but at least the word had spread, the fear had spread. And so individuals were really hesitant to go into court,\" Powers said.   \n   The number of in absentia removals was generally already on an upward trend each year since 2022, said Andrew Arthur, resident law and policy fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit that advocates for lower levels of migration. Still, the number of such removal orders in fiscal year 2025 nearly tripled that of the previous year — topping over 50,000.   NPR calculated just how many people were ordered removed \"in absentia.\"   Each of the top 10 cities with the largest number of completed immigration cases in those courts is on track to end the year with a higher rate of in absentia removals than they started. That is according to data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review — part of the Department of Justice — from January through November.   \n   Each of these courts experienced an uptick in this kind of removal order starting in the summer months. That timeline is consistent with when immigration attorneys say ICE officers began arresting people inside the courts.   Loading...\n   NPR has spoken with the family members of immigrants who came to court in New York, for example, in place of their parents or partners — out of concern their loved ones might be detained. New York's courts have become notorious this year for scenes of violent arrests and confrontations with federal officers.   Powers said that there are other reasons people may fear coming to court, including that they may not win their case or get deported to a third country. There are logistical barriers, too.   \"A lot of times people don't even know that they have a hearing, or hearing dates can change without receiving the notice in the mail,\" Powers said. Sometimes immigrants can move and addresses are not immediately updated with the court, or go to places like apartment buildings that have less consistent mail delivery, she said. Notices can also be sent to completely incorrect addresses, which lawyers said has been an issue in years past.   Immigration attorneys across the country have noticed an uptick in this kind of removal order. Organizations like the Center for Immigration Studies have also spotted it.   Loading...\n   In many cases, the Department of Homeland Security has to receive a removal order issued by an immigration judge before it can physically deport any person from the U.S., Arthur said.   \"The more orders of removal in absentia or at the end of proceedings that are issued, the more people that ICE can then target for removal from the United States,\" he said.   Arthur said that immigrants who fail to appear opt to not take the government up on the offer for due process.   \n   \"The more people who are under final orders for removal … the more people who are going to end up in ICE custody because the law requires that ICE take into custody everybody who's under a final order of removal, notwithstanding the administration's stated focus on the worst,\" Arthur said.    Loading... \n   \"This appears to be well in excess of those historical trends,\" Arthur said.   Immigrants may have the opportunity to reopen their cases. However, most people in immigration court do not have legal representation, which they must pay for themselves.   Nonprofits like the organization Mobile Pathways have tracked a low rate of arrests in courts. But immigrant advocates said that doesn't mean the fear and negative perceptions go away.   \"It probably falls into the narrative that the administration wants to be portrayed, that these individuals are not participating in the process that they're supposed to,\" Powers said, about the rise in no-show removal orders.   \n   Some families she represents have fled violence, are working through trauma, or are navigating language and other barriers in addition to the immigration law system.   \"[They] are just making the best decisions they can with the information they have provided to them,\" Powers said, adding that most immigrants are still showing up for their court appointments. \"It's just because a lot of things are being stacked up against them. And that's why we're seeing these numbers.\"\n",

While Musk no longer leads DOGE, the idea of trimming the federal government remains.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Earlier this month, billionaire Elon Musk, the onetime DOGE leader and Trump adviser, sat down with Katie Miller on her podcast to reflect on his time with the administration.   He called DOGE's work \"a little bit successful\" but said he wouldn't do it again if given the chance.   \"We were somewhat successful, Musk said. \"I mean we stopped a lot of funding … that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful.\"   Musk left his role with DOGE in May after legal setbacks and clashes with Trump's cabinet.   Yet even as he retreated from Washington, the idea that slashing wasteful spending will lead to profound cuts to the nation's growing deficit remains central to the Trump administration's vision of a slimmed down bureaucracy.   \n   While many of DOGE's initial outsized promises to increase efficiency and slash spending never fully materialized, the Trump administration has not given up on those goals.   Here's a look back at some of what DOGE did and did not accomplish in its inaugural year and how the Trump administration is calibrating its tactics to make more incremental and less high-profile tweaks to federal agencies.   Shrinking the federal workforce    Agencies ordered to fire employees earlier in the year by DOGE were hiring back hundreds of workers ahead of the end of the fiscal year in September, while the Office of Management and Budget tried to lay off more people during the longest-ever federal government shutdown in October.    Still, by the end of 2025, some 317,000 federal employees will be out of the government, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some federal agencies and programs — like the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and much of the Education Department — have been effectively eliminated.   \n   Despite those reductions and a push to cut contracts and terminate leases, the federal government is still spending more money than it brings in.   Focus on slashing \"Democrat priorities\"   Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought is leading the push to streamline the federal workforce. Vought has long called for the federal government to have a smaller footprint, most recently including efforts to enact mass reductions-in-force at several agencies during the federal government shutdown that started in October and was blocked by the courts.   \n   Also during the shutdown, the Trump administration announced several rounds of funding cuts aimed at what the president called \"Democrat priorities\" like transportation and energy grants, continuing the trend of spending money on policies they like and removing funding from policies that Trump disagrees with.   Trump's priorities rely on the sharing of sensitive data   DOGE's push to consolidate sensitive personal data across federal agencies has survived legal challenges and been used for the administration's immigration enforcement priorities.   That includes the transformation of a federal citizenship verification database, demands for states to hand over information about federal food aid recipients and more. At least some of those efforts have wrongly flagged U.S. citizens, NPR has previously reported.   \n   Government restructuring efforts still exist   Even though the DOGE entity has not dominated the headlines in recent months since Musk departed the federal government, the focus of its work has not stopped.   Many of Musk's top allies and DOGE lieutenants have transitioned to become full-time employees at the agencies they were detailed to.   An Aug. 21, 2025 executive order signed by the president created the National Design Studio that aims to \"fill the digital potholes\" of the federal government's online systems and websites.   \n   The chief design officer in charge of this effort, Joe Gebbia, is an Airbnb cofounder and Musk associate who led DOGE's overhaul and digitization of the federal employee retirement system at the Office of Personnel Management.   The studio is responsible for the website for the new \"Trump Accounts,\" tax-advantaged investment accounts for U.S. children created under Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" signed earlier this year. Other projects include the Energy Department's \"Genesis Mission\" and the US Tech Force, a two-year program seeking \"an elite corps of engineers to build the next generation of government technology.\"   Federal spending still isn't reigned in   One of the stated reasons DOGE was created was to tackle the national debt, which grew more than $2.2 trillion from October 1, 2024 to Sept. 30, 2025 to more than $38 trillion.   That number is expected to grow by at least $3 trillion additional dollars in the next decade over baseline projections due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law earlier this year that includes tax cuts and new spending on Trump's priorities.   \"President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement provided to NPR.   The White House did not directly respond to NPR's questions about the government's deficit spending or the increase in the national debt.   From the start of the new fiscal year in October to the end of November, the federal government has spent nearly a half trillion dollars more than it has brought in, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That's slightly less than the same period last year.   The vast majority of federal spending — about 65% this fiscal year — goes toward Social Security, Medicare, health programs, income security and veterans' benefits and services. Another smaller percentage has been interest payments towards the country's debt, plus 14% for national defense.   \n   DOGE's work did not touch on these broadly popular programs that would require congressional action to change.\n",

MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.   Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.   \n   \"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace,\" says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.   \"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate,\" she adds. \"It's just bad for the economy.\"   There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.   \n   Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.   \n   Lipton calls this capitalism by \"schmoozing,\" and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.   \"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products,\" she says. \"If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody.\"   Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, \"In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership.\"   China-style 'state capitalism'   Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or \"rules-based\" capitalism.   \n   This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.   But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of \"state capitalism,\" in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it \"crony capitalism,\" meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.   \"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that,\" says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in  President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.   \n   In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried \"about the current political and legal climate's impact on their companies.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang listens as President Trump speaks at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November in Washington, D.C. Nvidia has spent the year seeking the U.S. government's approval to sell more of its semiconductor chips in China.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says \"this narrative about how [President Trump] reshaped capitalism is significantly overstated\" and calls Trump's policies by and large \"the traditional free-market policy-making that you would expect coming out of a Republican Administration.\"   The official dismissed claims that the White House is engaging in \"crony capitalism,\" and says \"there are companies that are benefiting [from Trump's policies] whether or not they have a good relationship with the administration.\"   The official also notes that so far, the U.S. government has largely sought to take ownership stakes or revenue-sharing deals from companies that play a role in economic and national security: For example, Intel and Nvidia both sell the semiconductors at the center of the artificial-intelligence arms race with China. The U.S. government has also taken stakes or other interests in U.S. Steel and MP Materials, a rare-earth minerals mining company, among others.   \n   \"What we're trying to do is very much embracing the free market and the growth that it unleashes, but making targeted interventions where there's too much on the line,\" the official says.   Tech winners vs. everyone else in corporate America   Businesses largely welcomed President Trump's victory in last year's election, in part due to frustration with what they perceived as a harsh and \"anti-business\" regulatory climate under President Biden.   And some seem pretty happy with his first year in office — especially the tech billionaires whose \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are powering the A.I. boom.   \"The Magnificent Seven and Trump 2.0 are really on the same page to a large extent,\" says Daniel Kinderman, a political science professor at the University of Delaware who studies what he calls \"authoritarian capitalism\" and business responses to right-wing movements.    Some of President Trump's policies, including his sweeping tariffs and his changes to immigration policies for highly-skilled foreign workers, have complicated the business of Big Tech. But most tech CEOs have tried to avoid criticizing those policies publicly, and instead focused on donating to Trump's personal projects. Apple's Tim Cook, for example, this summer presented Trump with a gold-plated and glass plaque as his company promised to invest $600 billion in the United States.    Such gifts appear to have helped: Apple's iPhones have escaped the worst of Trump's tariffs.   Apple did not respond to a request for comment.   Kinderman points out that for wealthy and powerful CEOs, Trump's degree of personal involvement in their businesses at least makes it efficient to deal directly with him — if they can keep him happy — instead of wading through the slow and complicated red tape of federal regulatory processes.   \"These companies are a huge portion of the American economy,\" he says. \"And I think Trump is also giving them, to a large extent, what they want.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In August, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented President Trump with a gold-plated and glass plaque, as his company pledged to invest a total of $600 billion in the United States.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Still, he and others warn that, taken to the extreme, codependent relationships between political leaders and CEOs don't always end well for the latter.   \n   In more authoritarian countries, where leaders exert much more control over private businesses, the stakes can be especially fraught. Russia, Hungary, and China all exercise some form of state-controlled capitalism, where an autocratic leader cultivates relationships with oligarchic business CEOs — and can quickly force them out of favor.   As one extreme example, Ballou-Aares invokes Jack Ma, the Alibaba founder who built one of China's biggest tech companies before criticizing the country's financial regulations … and then largely disappearing from public view for several years.   \"We know that crony capitalism never really ends well for most companies,\" she says. \"I mean, tell Jack Ma that autocracy is okay for business.\"   'Most CEOs are pretty frustrated'   Outside of Big Tech, many businesses feel a lot more conflicted about how President Trump is reshaping U.S. capitalism. Some have even filed lawsuits against the administration, over its tariffs and its immigration policies.   \"Despite the handful of tech titans that do seem to admittedly genuflect at the White House and at Mar-a-Lago, most CEOs are pretty frustrated with what's happening,\" says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor who regularly speaks with CEOs.    Pockets of frustration from corporate America have become more visible recently. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the administration over its plans to start charging $100,000 for H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers — although it did so while praising Trump's \"ambitious agenda.\"   \n   And JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon, who runs the country's largest bank and is one of the most prominent non-tech CEOs in the country, recently told CNN why his company had declined to donate to Trump's White House ballroom.   \"Since we do a lot of contracts with governments here and around the world, we have to be very careful about how anything is perceived,\" Dimon said. \"We're quite conscious of risks we bear by doing anything that looks like buying favors or anything like that.\"   \n   That said, most businesses are reluctant to publicly criticize President Trump or his policies. Smaller companies lack the power to effectively stand up to the White House. And even those running the country's biggest companies are unwilling to draw the personal attacks that Trump can often wield, or the ensuing partisan boycotts and financial damage that can follow.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Earlier this month, demolition work continued where the East Wing once stood at the White House. President Trump ordered the East Wing and Jacqueline Kennedy Garden leveled to make way for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom that he says will be paid for with private donations from companies including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Many businesses have neither the appetite nor the capacity to take on the U.S. government. They just want to focus on making money, even if that means adapting to dramatic tariffs or other sharp shifts in government policy.   \"It's tactical fire-fighting,\" says Drew DeLong, who advises businesses around the world as head of corporate statecraft for the consulting company Kearney, and who served in the State Department during Trump's first administration.   \"Every moment and every hour you spend on tariff mitigation is one less hour that you spend on innovation,\" he says. \"There is an urgency towards fire-fighting as best as they possibly can, but there's also a fatigue.\"   'Merger review has been weaponized'   The Trump Administration's approach to approving — or not — corporate mergers has drawn some of the highest scrutiny, because of the nexus of political and business issues at stake.   \n   For example, the Federal Communications Commission this year approved several telecommunications mergers only after Verizon and T-Mobile agreed to terminate internal policies around \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" or DEI. Then it threatened to take federal action against some ABC affiliates over Jimmy Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's killing on his ABC late-night show; the owners of some of those stations were also seeking federal approvals for mergers. (ABC parent Walt Disney suspended Kimmel's show for almost a week, before reinstating him. ABC did not respond to requests for comment.)   \"Merger review has been weaponized into a tool for control,\" says Elizabeth Wilkins, the former chief of staff to Lina Khan, who oversaw U.S. merger review as chair of President Biden's Federal Trade Commission.   \n   \"With those kinds of tools hanging over corporate leaders' heads, we have seen an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear — which breeds silence,\" adds Wilkins, who now runs the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.   The exception is, again, for leaders who cultivate close ties with the president. This year, the White House helped broker a deal for a coalition of U.S. investors to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok — and asked for an unusual multibillion-dollar payment to the federal government, which business experts have compared to a \"shakedown\" or \"extortion.\" Some of those same investors, including Trump ally Larry Ellison and his son, David, are now seeking even more media deals.   Some business experts say now that corporate America has a better idea of President Trump's playbook in this administration, they expect to see companies and their executives feel more confident about how and when to push back against White House policies that they think will damage their businesses and the wider economy.   \"I think it is clear that the administration's approach here is broadly unpopular, including with business,\" says Ballou-Aares.   But Kearney's DeLong, the veteran of Trump's first administration, warns businesses to brace for much more policy change, and uncertainty about what capitalism and the economy will look like in the future.   \"This is just year one,\" he says. \"Where do we go [during] the rest of this administration? Where do we go after?\"\n",

The mass departure follows turmoil within Heritage and the larger conservative movement over the role of right-wing influencers who've promoted antisemitic and other extremist ideas. Those tensions were on display at Heritage after its president, Kevin Roberts, released a video defending Tucker Carlson for a friendly interview in October with Nick Fuentes, an avowed white nationalist who has previously praised Adolf Hitler. Roberts' video sparked controversy inside Heritage, prompting him to later apologize for it.   \n   Pence's think tank, Advancing American Freedom, or AAF, announced the hires on Monday, saying they include leaders from the Heritage Foundation's legal, economic and data teams.   In a statement, Pence welcomed the new hires and said they \"bring a wealth of experience, a love of country, and a deep commitment to the Constitution and Conservative Movement that will further the cause of liberty.\"   AAF President Tim Chapman told NPR that after learning of the Heritage staffers' interest in leaving the organization, AAF raised $13 million toward a $15 million goal in two weeks to help fund their salaries over the next three years.   The move dramatically expands AAF's size, Chapman said, taking the organization from 18 employees to more than 30. Chapman said AAF is bolstering its research team in an effort to fill what it sees as a gap within the modern conservative movement.   Chapman said AAF will promote traditional conservative ideas such as low taxation, strong national defense and limited regulation at a time when he said the Republican Party and others on the right are in a battle to define the future.   \"I think what's happening right now is that a movement that has oriented itself around political personalities and specific political leaders is starting to realize that those leaders are not going to be here forever, whether it's President Trump or other leaders,\" Chapman said.   \n   \"There is an end date on their leadership … And so the question is now popping up, what is it that the movement after that leadership structure, what is it that that movement stands for after that?\"   Meanwhile, in a statement to NPR, Heritage Foundation Chief Advancement Officer Andy Olivastro accused some of the staff members who left of \"disloyalty,\" adding that the departures \"clear the way for a stronger, more focused team.\"   A task force focused on fighting antisemitism recently cut ties with Heritage over related concerns. Heritage has played an influential role in the Trump administration, including through its publication of Project 2025, which outlines a detailed list of conservative policy goals and plans, many of which the administration has implemented.\n",

CECOT gained notoriety in 2025 when the Trump administration began its controversial policy of deporting people to El Salvador who they claimed were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua.\n                \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Moore/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A federal judge on Monday said the U.S. government denied due process to the Venezuelan men it deported to a prison in El Salvador in March after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act.   The case over the Alien Enemies Act first brought into focus critiques about the Trump administration's lack of due process in its immigration policy.   The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward challenged the deportation of the Venezuelans, saying the Alien Enemies Act was invoked illegally and that the men should have been given the opportunity to argue against their removal.   \n   Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in his order agreed that they deserved the right to a hearing — whether by bringing them back to the U.S. or allowing them to pursue legal remedies from abroad.   \n   \"On the merits, the Court concludes that this class was denied their due-process rights and will thus require the Government to facilitate their ability to obtain such hearing. Our law requires no less,\" Boasberg wrote in his opinion.   The Trump administration is likely to appeal.   President Trump around March 15 invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to target members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang he said was invading the United States. The government sent several planeloads of alleged gang members to El Salvador immediately after invoking the act, including 137 people under the statute, the White House said at the time. (The men have since been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange.)    \n   Boasberg imposed a temporary restraining order barring deportations that same evening — but the planes still arrived in El Salvador. The Justice Department argued that the judge had overstepped his authority by inserting himself into questions of foreign policy.   \"This ruling makes clear the government can't just send people off to a brutal foreign prison with zero due process and simply walk away,\" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, lead counsel in the case.   \"Meaningful opportunity\" to make their case   Boasberg in Monday's order said the U.S. maintained custody over the men while they were imprisoned at a notorious prison in El Salvador, so the court continued to have jurisdiction over their fate. He gave the administration until January 5 to either \"facilitate\" their return to the U.S., or \"to otherwise provide them with hearings that satisfy the requirements of due process.\"   \n   He said regardless of whether Trump was lawful in invoking the Alien Enemies Act, the men deserved to have a \"meaningful opportunity\" to prove they weren't gang members before being deported.   \"Otherwise, a finding of unlawful removal would be meaningless for Plaintiffs, who have already been sent back to Venezuela against their wishes and without due process,\" he said. \"Expedited removal cannot be allowed to render this relief toothless,\" Boasberg said, otherwise there would be nothing to stop the government from \"secretly spiriting\" people to a foreign country.   Boasberg also certified the group of people removed on March 15 as a class, meaning the Venezuelans who brought the case as plaintiffs could represent the entire group of men removed.   Separately, Boasberg had in July said there was \"probable cause\" to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt for violating his order to stop the planes going to El Salvador in the first place. An appeals court stepped in earlier this month to put a pause on that issue until at least the new year.\n",

His comments come as the Department of Homeland Security says the U.S. Coast Guard is pursuing an oil tanker that has recently departed from Venezuela, the third oil-carrying vessel pursued this month off the country's coast. Two ships have already been seized.   \n   The move follows President Donald Trump's announcement last week to put a \"total and complete blockade\" against Venezuelan oil and sanctioned tankers. Trump said more military pressure would come \"until they return to the United States of America, all of the oil, land and other assets that Venezuela stole from us.\"   Venezuela denies that it has stolen from the U.S. and says Trump is after the country's natural resources, including its vast oil reserves.

The pause, effective immediately, is the latest step the administration has taken to hobble offshore wind in its push against renewable energy sources. It comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Donald Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, calling it unlawful.   The administration said the pause will give the Interior Department, which oversees offshore wind, time to work with the Defense Department and other agencies to assess the possible ways to mitigate any security risks posed by the projects.   \n   \"The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. \"Today's action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers.\"   The statement did not detail the national security risks.   Wind proponents slammed the move, saying it was another blow by the administration against clean energy.   \n   The administration said leases are paused for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.   The Interior Department said unclassified reports from the U.S. government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called \"clutter.\" The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of wind projects, the Interior Department said.   National security expert and former Commander of the USS Cole Kirk Lippold said the projects were awarded permits \"following years of review by state and federal agencies,\" including the Coast Guard, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Air Force and more.   \n   \"The record of decisions all show that the Department of Defense was consulted at every stage of the permitting process,\" he said, arguing that the projects would benefit national security because they would diversify the country's energy supply.   \n   The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.   Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.   Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump's Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.   Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.   \n   Wind supporters called the administration's actions illegal and said offshore wind provides some of the most affordable, reliable electric power to the grid.   \"For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country's need for electricity is surging,\" said Ted Kelly of the Environmental Defense Fund.   \"Now the administration is again illegally blocking clean, affordable energy,\" Kelly said. \"We should not be kneecapping America's largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity.''   The administration's actions are especially egregious because, at the same time, it is propping up aging, expensive coal plants \"that barely work and pollute our air,\" Kelly said.   The Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston-based environmental group, called the pause \"a desperate rerun of the Trump administration's failed attempt to kill offshore wind,'' noting that courts have already rejected the administration's arguments.   \n   \"Trying again to halt these projects tramples on the rule of law, threatens jobs and deliberately sabotages a critical industry that strengthens — not weakens — America's energy security,\" said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the law foundation.\n",

Its goal is to elect at least a handful of independents to disrupt the two-party system on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    Glenn Harvey for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Glenn Harvey for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The rise of AI assistants is rewriting the rhythms of everyday life: People are feeding their blood test results into chatbots, turning to ChatGPT for advice on their love lives and leaning on AI for everything from planning trips to finishing homework assignments.   Now, one organization suggests artificial intelligence can go beyond making daily life more convenient. It says it's the key to reshaping American politics.   \"Without AI, what we're trying to do would be impossible,\" explained Adam Brandon, a senior adviser at the Independent Center, a nonprofit that studies and engages with independent voters.   \n   The goal is to elect a handful of independent candidates to the House of Representatives in 2026, using AI to identify districts where independents could succeed and uncover diamond in the rough candidates.   In a time when control of the House balances on a knife's edge, winning even a handful of seats could deny either party from getting a majority and upend the way the House currently operates.   It's a bold proposition in a system that hasn't seen a new independent candidate win a House seat in 35 years.   But data shows a rise in moderate and independent voters. Gallup found 43% of Americans — a record high — claiming the independent label in 2024. Exit polls that year showed 34% of voters identified as independent, up from 26% in 2020.    \"There's a huge chunk of people who for different reasons can't stomach either of the two parties,\" said David Barker, a professor of government at American University. \"It's the first time in a long time where a plurality of Americans are now identifying as independents, and so that does seem to signal a pretty important shift.\"   Brandon said that shift is what makes the time right to disrupt the status quo.   \"It's like Uber and taxis. You had a system with an obvious flaw, that had entrenched operators and took a radical change to go completely around it,\" he told NPR. \"And that's what we're feeling now. People are so stuck into 'Republican' and 'Democrat' and we're like, well, there's something else.\"   \n   \"We're political fighters\"   Trying to throw a wrench into the stranglehold of a two-party system is an uphill battle, pushing against political orthodoxy and plenty of skeptics.   But the Independent Center's strategists are a far cry from political newbies.   \"We're political fighters,\" said Brandon, who served as president of FreedomWorks, the conservative grassroots group that helped turn Tea Party activists into a political force before closing its doors last year. \"We have built a team of people that know how to do this. We're not going to be pushovers.\"    Brandon works closely with Brett Loyd, who runs The Bullfinch Group, the nonpartisan polling and data firm overseeing the polling and research at the Independent Center. He previously worked on President Trump's polling team, when the president was a candidate.   \"I'm a statistician. I kind of joke that I worked for the RNC because they offered me a job before the DNC,\" he said with a smile. \"My job is numbers and sentiment and game theory. It's not necessarily Republican or Democratic.\"   He makes it clear the goal of their work isn't to erase partisanship altogether.   \"This isn't going to work everywhere. It's going to work in very specific areas,\" Loyd said. \"If you live in a hyper-Republican or hyper-Democratic district, you should have a Democrat or Republican representing you.\"   But with the help of AI, he's identified 40 seats that don't fit that mold, where he said independents can make inroads with voters fed up with both parties. The Independent Center plans to have about 10 candidates in place by spring with the goal of winning at least half of the races.   Brandon predicts those wins could prompt moderate partisans in the House to switch affiliations.   \"I had one Republican [member] tell me in his office, 'I'm too chicken**** to do this right now,'\" he recalled. \"'But if you can do this, I will join you.'\"   \n   From mining Reddit to matching on LinkedIn   Their proprietary AI tool created by an outside partner has been years in the making.    While focus groups and polling have long driven understanding of American sentiments, AI can monitor what people are talking about in real time.   \"Polling is a snapshot in time — a Tuesday at 11 when you got the phone call or you were at the focus group, this is how you felt, but then you went home and your views changed. We can watch that,\" Brandon said.    They're using AI to understand core issues and concerns of voters and to hunt for districts ripe for an independent candidate to swoop in.   \"A district that's 50% Republican and 50% Democratic that keeps flip-flopping because of who showed up on a given night, is that something that is truly independent versus a district in Arizona where a plurality is independent but they're plugging their nose and voting?\" Loyd explained. \"We're looking at voter participation rates. What districts have really low turnout because those people aren't excited to go to the ballot box.\"   He's also looking at districts with younger voters, who he said embrace the independent message.    \"When I say Gen Z and millennials, people keep rolling their eyes and they're like, 'the kids,'\" he said. \"Well, those kids are going to be more than half the electorate in the next presidential election.\"   From there, the next step is taking the data and finding what the dream candidate looks like.   The Independent Center is recruiting candidates both from people who reach out to the organization directly and with the help of AI.    They can even run their data through LinkedIn to identify potential candidates with certain interests and career and volunteer history.   \"Usually they're not self-promoting, but their actions leave a footprint,\" Loyd said, giving the example of someone volunteering at an event covered by the local paper. \"We ask our AI to find that footprint.\"   \n   The AI also informs where a candidate is best placed to win.   Brandon points to one instance where a candidate was poised to run in their home district. The AI showed the district next door is a better bet.    \"Thirty minutes way, perfect fit,\" he said. \"And that's what [that person's] going to do, because we found they matched up perfectly.\"   \"What's wrong with spoiling something people don't like?\"   One criticism Brandon and Loyd acknowledge they hear often is the idea of \"spoilers\" — nonwinning candidates whose presence on the ballot affects which candidate wins.   \"It's a partisan, archaic line,\" Loyd said. \"What's wrong with spoiling something people don't like?\"   He said the people criticizing independents getting into races as spoilers have an entrenched interest in the current system.   \"The Republican and Democratic establishments still live in a world that's binary. It's Coke or Pepsi, it's Ford or Chevy, it's MSNBC or Fox News,\" he said. \"That works for people that watch MSNBC and Fox News. Everybody else? We don't live in that binary system anymore.\"   Brandon said the only thing to do is lean in.   \"We're going to embrace the spoiler because what we're spoiling is a pretty corrupt system.\"\n",

The Trump administration is targeting the food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), for major changes, citing data about the program it has demanded from the states that administer the program.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is promising big changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which currently helps almost 42 million Americans buy groceries.   In recent media appearances, she said attention on SNAP during the government shutdown \"has given us a platform to completely deconstruct the program\" and said details about structural changes to the program would be released this week.   \n   Rollins has made a case for sweeping changes to SNAP by asserting her agency uncovered \"massive fraud\" in state data the agency demanded, and has emphasized statistics suggesting wrongdoing without providing the underlying data or details.   \n   The Trump administration's latest campaign for SNAP changes comes as millions of recipients are already poised to lose benefits in the coming years as states begin to implement new work requirements and eligibility rules that Republicans in Congress passed over the summer that are the deepest cuts in history to the program.   In a Fox Business interview last month, Rollins said the further changes she is proposing will \"make sure those vulnerable Americans who really need that benefit are going to get it. And for all the rest of the fraudsters and the people who are corrupt and taking advantage of it — we're going to protect the taxpayer, too.\"   Food policy experts say they are concerned that Rollins' talking points suggest a distorted view of the prevalence of SNAP recipients committing fraud, and seem to conflate fraud with payment errors of any kind.   \"My worry is that she's risking setting a public narrative that this is a program that has more fraud than it actually does, or that the people who need it and use it to meet their very basic food needs are somehow committing a crime by seeking food assistance,\" said Stacy Dean, executive director of George Washington University's Global Food Institute and a former U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) official during the Biden administration.   \n   \"And that's just it's not it's not good for the program. It's absolutely terrible for the people who need it,\" Dean said.   Comments Rollins made in recent weeks that everyone on SNAP would have to reapply sparked confusion among SNAP recipients, state officials and food policy experts. SNAP recipients already have to go through a recertification process — in most cases every six or 12 months, and it is unclear what legal authority USDA would have to add additional steps.   A group of Democratic U.S. senators sent a letter last month asking Rollins to clarify what she meant and pointed out that SNAP is facing \"unprecedented cuts\" and there is additional uncertainty after the Trump administration halted SNAP payments during the shutdown.   \"We are therefore troubled that the Administration could choose, at this moment, to add additional red tape that creates duplicative and unnecessary barriers to accessing nutrition assistance for families,\" the letter reads.   USDA officials are seemingly walking back the suggestion that there will be a new reapplication process for SNAP recipients. A statement from the agency indicates that it plans to use existing recertification protocols.   \"Secretary Rollins wants to ensure the fraud, waste, and incessant abuse of SNAP ends. Rates of fraud were only previously assumed, and President Trump is doing something about it,\" reads a statement from a USDA spokesperson. \"Using standard recertification processes for households is a part of that work. As well as ongoing analysis of state data, further regulatory work, and improved collaboration with states.\"   Unpacking Rollins' claims   Earlier this year, the USDA made an unprecedented demand to states to turn over personal data of SNAP recipients. Most Democratic-led states refused, and a federal judge in San Francisco blocked USDA from withholding funding from states that did not comply and found the federal agency's data demand was likely unlawful.   \n   But 28 states and Guam did turn over data, according to a USDA spokesperson, and Rollins has been citing statistics from that data in several media appearances in recent weeks as evidence that the food assistance program needs to be overhauled.   In a recent News Nation interview, Rollins said the state data showed that \"186,000 dead people receiving benefits, 500,000 Americans receiving benefits two times, so double what they should be receiving. We've arrested more than 120 people with SNAP fraud,\" Rollins said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins points to a chart on SNAP benefits during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Oct. 31 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"And that doesn't include most of the blue states where we believe there's even more fraud and abuse. And under the last administration, the SNAP benefits increased 40%. So clearly, there's a right-sizing that needs to happen.\"   \n   The USDA has not presented data that backs up these statistics, which makes it hard to evaluate their significance.   For example, some deceased individuals will inevitably be enrolled in the program because state officials have to verify the death and provide time for the household to respond before SNAP benefits are reduced or terminated. Households that erroneously receive payments when someone is deceased must pay that money back.   As for people receiving two benefit payments, the specifics of the cases Rollins cited are still unknown, but in court filings a California state official listed a number of legitimate explanations for why that can occur — including when a SNAP household is owed a supplemental payment to correct an error.   It is also unclear what Rollins means when she says SNAP benefits increased 40% under the Biden administration. USDA did not respond to a question seeking clarification.   The department announced that SNAP payments would expand 40% due to the pandemic in April 2020 — during President Trump's first term.   Lauren Bauer, a fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution and the associate director of The Hamilton Project, analyzed USDA data but was unable to find evidence of a 40% increase under Biden. Instead, she found that during Trump's presidency benefit costs increased by more than 30%, while during Biden's term they decreased by almost 17%.   \"The dynamics of benefit increases and decreases is not really about presidencies. It's about the business cycle and where we are in terms of a recession and in terms of the climb out of it,\" Bauer said.   More SNAP changes to come   A draft of a regulation that the USDA submitted to the Office of Management and Budget last month could provide a clue for one of the changes to SNAP the Trump administration could unveil soon.   The draft calls for narrowing what is known as \"broad-based categorical eligibility\" for SNAP, which is currently used by more than 40 states to ensure welfare recipients can receive SNAP.   \n   Researchers at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute have argued this eligibility rule should be ended because states are using it to allow people with incomes above the limit set by the SNAP statute to receive the benefit. Though they also cautioned that eliminating broad-based categorical eligibility must be done in a way that addresses \"benefit cliffs\" that would disincentivize people from earning slightly more because they would lose benefits and become worse off.   Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who has criticized the potential change, estimates a policy change like this could lead to nearly 6 million people losing SNAP benefits.   \"At every opportunity, the administration is seeking additional ways to attack anti-hunger programs,\" Bergh said.\n",

In a Truth Social post, Trump said \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"   The Venezuelan government responded with a statement saying Trump's comments violate international law and are a \"colonialist threat\" to the country's sovereignty.   \"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutional framework has the power to interfere with, block, or condition the use of international airspace,\" the statement said.   \n   As of Sunday afternoon, Flightradar24 shows planes continuing to fly in Venezuelan airspace.   This comes a day after the Senate and House Armed Services committees said they would look into the Pentagon after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to kill all crew members aboard a boat suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean in September. NPR has confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.   The military has carried out at least 21 strikes and killed at least 82 people on alleged drug boats as part of \"Operation Southern Spear,\" a campaign that the Trump administration says is aimed at tackling drug-trafficking.   Venezuela said in its statement that \"such statements represent an explicit use of force, which is prohibited by Article 2, paragraph 4 of the U.N. Charter of the United Nations.\"   Democrats have also strongly criticized the administration's strategy, saying the military didn't have enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs before conducting the strikes. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, told ABC'S This Week on Sunday it's possible the military's actions could be considered a \"war crime,\" and that Hegseth should be held accountable.   \"They've never presented the public with the information they've got here,\" Van Hollen said, \"But it could be worse than that, right? If that theory is wrong, then it's plain murder.\"   \n   However, Republican Senator Eric Schmitt, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News that Trump is acting \"well within his Article 2 powers\" when it comes to curbing drug smuggling by striking the boats.   \"I think it's a two part strategy,\" Schmitt said. \"One is to get rid of the precursors that are coming from China, and then take out the cartels that are distributing this and bringing it to the United States of America.\"   Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have expressed frustration at Trump's stance on Venezuela, and that the Trump administration conducted the strikes without legislative approval.   \"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on X on Saturday, hours after Trump's post about Venezuelan airspace.   Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former Trump ally, also posted on Saturday, saying \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump says he's closing Venezuela's airspace and further limiting immigration to the U.S. Lawmakers are facing a deadline over extending the subsidies for Obamacare.   \n\n    LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:  President Donald Trump heads back to Washington after spending Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. He's been posting about Afghan nationals and immigration following the attack last week on two National Guard members near the White House. It was an attack that fatally wounded one of them. Additionally, Trump has said that Venezuela's airspace is closed. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram joins us now. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey there.FRAYER: So first, a fact-check - can the U.S. president close another country's airspace?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, it's a fair question, Lauren, because we don't really have a lot of details or follow-up from the White House about this social media post from Trump that came over the weekend. And all the president said is that the airspace, quote, \"above and surrounding Venezuela,\" should be considered \"closed in its entirety.\" And his post was addressed to airlines, pilots, drug dealers and human traffickers. And that's pretty much all we've heard, no other details or any clarification. Is this new policy? You know, what did the president mean by this?The bottom line, though, is that the president does not have the authority to close another country's airspace. Though I will note that recently, the FAA, which is the Federal Aviation Administration - they did warn that airspace over Venezuela could potentially be hazardous, but that doesn't mean that the airspace is closed.FRAYER: Well, how has Venezuela responded?SHIVARAM: Yeah. The Venezuelan government, you know, said it forcefully rejects the president's statement. They called it a colonial threat that undermines Venezuela's sovereignty. Really no mincing words there - and, you know, keep in mind - this is what's important - this is all coming as the U.S. has conducted multiple strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea, the Eastern Pacific, on these boats that the U.S. government says are carrying drugs, and dozens of people have been killed in these strikes.And then on top of that, Trump has also recently indicated that the U.S. would stop drug traffickers by land as well. And he recently declared the government of Nicolas Maduro, who leads Venezuela, as a terrorist organization. So the tension on this issue has really escalated here.FRAYER: Deepa, switching gears - Trump said that he was requesting 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., following that shooting last week. Is that happening?SHIVARAM: Right. So the president announced he was going to add 500 more National Guard troops, like you said, to D.C. This happened shortly after the attack on guard members outside the White House - nearby the White House earlier this week. That plan appears to remain in place. Those 500 new guard members will join about the 2,000 guard members who are already in the city.And there is a new development, though, from the weekend, which is that the government has also declared that every group of National Guard members patrolling Washington, D.C, will also be accompanied by at least one D.C. police officer. The details of this - a little unclear. But a police officer who spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity said that D.C. police officers would be getting overtime pay to do this work, so it's not interfering with their already day-to-day duties.FRAYER: And the suspect accused of shooting those two National Guard members is an Afghan national, according to authorities. He lived in Washington state. And now the president says he wants more restrictions on immigrants because of this shooting. What exactly does President Trump want to do?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Well, the president, you know, posted on social media on his platform Truth Social, and he said that he wants to, quote, \"permanently pause migration from all third-world countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\" He commented that reverse migration is the answer here. In the immediate aftermath of that shooting, you know, Trump said that he wanted every Afghan who entered to the U.S. after U.S. troops pulled out of Kabul in 2021 - he wanted them to be reexamined. And remember, this happened in the Biden administration, so he's laying a lot of blame on former President Joe Biden.There really isn't much detail about what that means - the timeline of this, who would be in charge. There's already a lot of security, stringent examination of people who are coming into this country. They are being vetted, but all asylum decisions just in the last day or two have been halted to ensure more vetting and screening, and that's what the president is hoping for.FRAYER: And the president and lawmakers come back this week to another pressing problem that has yet to be resolved, and that's the extension of the enhanced subsidies for Obamacare. What's the latest on that?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Remember that this was the issue that really propelled the government to shut down just a month ago. Right now, Congress is pretty divided on how to do it. There's even some division among GOP members. I think the thing to watch out for, though, is to see how the White House and President Trump will weigh in on this because Republicans, like I said, aren't really on the same page here.FRAYER: That's NPR's White House correspondent, Deepa Shivaram.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters afterward that the session was productive but work remains in the search for a peace deal.   \"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"   The high-level negotiations in Florida came days before President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will be in Moscow to meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.   \n   Rubio, Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, represented the American side in the talks, held at a sensitive time as Ukraine continues to push back against Russian forces that invaded in 2022 while dealing with a domestic corruption scandal.   Diplomats have focused on revisions to a proposed U.S.-authored plan that was developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticized as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine.   \"The end goal is, obviously, not just the end of the war,\" Rubio said. \"But it's also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"   \"This is not just about peace deals,\" the top American diplomat said as the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach.   Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine's security council, responded to Rubio by expressing his country's appreciation for U.S. efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has at times claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for U.S. assistance during the war.   \"U.S. is hearing us,\" Umerov said. \"U.S. is supporting us. U.S. is working beside us.\"   \n   Umerov, who appeared with Rubio to deliver a brief statement to reporters after the talks, underscored Ukraine's gratitude for U.S. support during nearly 4-year war. But the senior official offered no hints about what, if any, progress was made during the talks.   \"Our objective is a prosperous, strong Ukraine,\" Umerov said. \"We discussed all the, important, matters that are important for Ukraine, for Ukrainian people, and U.S. was super supportive.\"   Umerov has been involved in ongoing talks. But until now, Ukraine's head negotiator had been Andrii Yermak, the powerful chief of staff of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Friday, Zelenskyy announced the resignation of Yermak, after his home was searched by anti-corruption investigators.   Zelenskyy's government has been roiled by fallout from a scandal over $100 million embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors, causing newfound domestic pressures for Zelenskyy.   It was only a week ago that Rubio had met with Yermak in Geneva, with each side saying the talks had been positive in putting together a revised peace plan.   \n   Among the other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, and presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz.   The plan, which Trump has since played down as a \"concept\" or a \"map\" to be \"fine-tuned,\" would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine's military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days. Negotiators have indicated the framework has changed, but it's not clear how its provisions have been altered.   It had initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas to Russia — a sticking point for Kyiv.   Trump said on Tuesday that he would send Witkoff and perhaps Kushner to Moscow this week to meet with Putin about the plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments published Sunday on Russian state television, said Putin would see Witkoff before Thursday, when Putin departs for India.   \n   Both Witkoff and Kushner, like Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza.   Zelenskyy wrote on X that the Ukrainian delegation would \"swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war.\"   In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said the American side was \"demonstrating a constructive approach.\"   \"In the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,\" he said.   Attacks continue despite diplomatic efforts to end the war   On Saturday, Russian drone and missile attacks in and around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killed at least three people and wounded dozens more, officials said. Fresh attacks overnight into Sunday killed one person and wounded 19 others, including four children, local officials said, when a drone hit a nine-story apartment block in the city of Vyshhorod in the Kyiv region.   \n   In a post on Telegram Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had attacked Ukraine with 122 strike drones and ballistic missiles.   \"Such attacks occur daily. This week alone, Russians have used nearly 1,400 strike drones, 1,100 guided aerial bombs and 66 missiles against our people. That is why we must strengthen Ukraine's resilience every day. Missiles and air defense systems are necessary, and we must also actively work with our partners for peace,\" Zelenskyy said.   \"We need real, reliable solutions that will help end the war,\" he added.   After Ukraine claimed responsibility for damaging a major oil terminal on Saturday near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, owned by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Kazakhstan told Ukraine on Sunday to stop attacking the Black Sea terminal. The CPC pipeline, which starts in Kazakhstan and ends at the Novorossisyk terminal, handles a large proportion of Kazakhstan's oil exports.   \n   \"We view what has occurred as an action harming the bilateral relations of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and we expect the Ukrainian side to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future,\" Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.   Madhani reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Elise Morton in London contributed to this report.\n",

    "body": "\n      A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found nearly 6-in-10 voters say President Trump's top priority should be lowering prices. That concern is being expressed loudly in the swing state of Wisconsin.   \n\n    LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:  Affordability. That's a word we will hear a lot of for the next 12 months. It's what voters say is a top concern, and it could be consequential in the swing state of Wisconsin. Reporters Chuck Quirmbach and Maayan Silver with member station WUWM join us now from Milwaukee. Welcome to the program.MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Thank you.CHUCK QUIRMBACH, BYLINE: Thank you.FRAYER: So what are you both hearing from voters?SILVER: How cost of living are affecting people? I stopped by a turkey giveaway where people talked about struggling with basic needs and really what they want politicians to do about it.QUIRMBACH: Yeah. And I've been talking with folks about the Affordable Care Act and the expectation here that for hundreds of thousands of people covered under this Obama-era law, health care will be less affordable next year.FRAYER: And, Chuck, you've been following some of the events that Democrats are already holding around the state about health care affordability. What are they focusing on?QUIRMBACH: Well, the prediction that premiums are going up in January and that subsidies, including a federal tax credit that the state of Wisconsin says saves the average Care Act enrollee about $650 per month, may expire at the end of December. About 275,000 people here could be affected. One of them, freelance writer Nancy Peske, spoke at a news conference held by Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin. Peske says she may also have to pay additional costs for her son, who just landed a job with no health coverage.NANCY PESKE: So he's going to have such an astronomical premium that I'm probably going to have to pay that, too. So, yeah, it's going to be very tight.FRAYER: That's one concern. There's also the cost of living in general. Maayan, what are you hearing from some of the people you spoke with at this food giveaway that you mentioned?SILVER: Yeah. There were plenty of people in line at the turkey giveaway who directly blamed Trump for rising costs, who said they'd be voting for Democrats. But I also found some people who said they didn't foresee voting. I talked to Sharol Britton (ph). She's a 57-year-old who's been struggling financially. She gets food stamps, is on supplemental security income. And these days, she's sleeping in a van. She used to vote for Democrats, but now says she's fed up with all politicians.SHAROL BRITTON: The Trump administration, Democrat, Republican, liberal, right wing, left wing, back wing, horizontal wing, I don't give a freak. Get your stuff together, period.SILVER: Britton doesn't plan to vote until, in her opinion, politicians stop focusing on the 1% and start thinking more about people like her.FRAYER: And if voters like her stay home, that could really matter for congressional races. Chuck, tell us about some of those.QUIRMBACH: Well, the GOP has a 6-2 majority in House seats here, with Democrats hoping next year to unseat Republican Derrick Van Orden in western Wisconsin and Bryan Steil in the district south of Milwaukee. Also Republican House member Tom Tiffany from northern Wisconsin is running for governor. It's an open seat as Democratic incumbent Tony Evers is retiring. Van Orden, Steil and Tiffany have all criticized the ACA, or Affordable Care Act. The hazard in doing so is that, according to a recent polling by Marquette University, 58% of Wisconsin voters back extending the Care Act subsidies. But the polling also says the GOP Congress members' stance seems to be in line with the views of the majority of Republican voters here. Brian Norby runs an engineering firm and is chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Party west of Milwaukee. Norby says the ACA's enhanced tax credits are a political football.BRIAN NORBY: Now they're essentially being used as a political tool to heighten up the Democratic base to come out and vote. So why should we continue to extend them when they're designed by the Democratic Party?FRAYER: OK. So President Trump won Wisconsin by just under 30,000 votes in large part because of these pocketbook issues. And now, one year later, NPR polling shows that nearly 6 in 10 Americans say the Trump administration should focus on lowering prices. Maya, what are you hearing from Trump voters about this?SILVER: So sometimes voters I talked to said that economic woes, for instance, the effect of the government shutdown, were exaggerated. Others told me their budgets are tight sometimes, but they generally gave a lot of grace to Trump and his administration. That includes Aaron Eckhart (ph). He's the president of a home building company. He's also a Republican who voted for Trump. And he says of the economy...AARON ECKHART: So I think it's turning around.SILVER: So you think that President Trump is delivering on the promises that he made to make life more affordable?ECKHART: Correct. Promises made, promises kept.SILVER: Other Republicans I spoke with say that Trump had only been in office this term for a year and that he could still right the ship.FRAYER: So is affordability going to stay a strong issue in Wisconsin for the next, you know, 11 months until the election? Chuck.QUIRMBACH: Well, it might depend on what, if anything, the White House and Congressional Republicans come up with on the Affordable Care Act. Senate Republicans have promised to vote on extending the subsidies by next month. Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin says she's willing to work with, quote, any Johnny-come-lately to help families avoid higher costs come January 1.SILVER: And when it comes to higher costs overall, I'd say that Wisconsin is really a tale of two states, urban and rural, red and blue. And while voters around the state are concerned with prices, some really have unique concerns. There's manufacturers around the state grappling with tariffs. There's Wisconsin's big agricultural center. It's the dairy state that everyone knows about, but it also has a sizable soybean, corn, ginseng crops. So it's also the number one cranberry-producing state in the country, which is really relevant for this time of year. These farmers and rural voters have long been loyal backers of President Trump. But in part because of tariffs, Democrats are really trying to make inroads there.FRAYER: That's Maayan Silver and Chuck Quirmbach of NPR member station WUWM in Milwaukee. Thank you.MAAYAN SILVER AND CHUCK QUIRMBACH: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN SHELLEY SONG, \"OVER AND EVEN\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

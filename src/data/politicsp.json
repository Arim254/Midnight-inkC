That came mere days after Trump said in the wake of the U.S. operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend that \"Colombia is very sick too\" and accused Petro of \"making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"   \n   In comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added of Petro, \"He's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.\" Asked whether U.S. intervention was possible, Trump responded, \"Sounds good to me.\"   Later Wednesday, addressing thousands of protesters that he had mobilized to rally against U.S. military threats, Petro said he had spoken with Trump for roughly one hour.   \"I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,\" he told the crowd in downtown Bogotá, where demonstrators had just minutes earlier chanted slogans against the United States at Petro's behest.   Petro explained to the audience that Colombian politicians allegedly linked to narco-trafficking misled the U.S. president about Petro's record to turn Trump against him.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Supporters of Colombian President Gustavo Petro attend a rally he called to protest comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, in Bogota, Colombia, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026.\n                \n                    Santiago Saldarriaga/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Santiago Saldarriaga/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"Those (people) are responsible for this crisis — let's call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now — that has erupted between the U.S. and Colombia,\" he said.   Trump now suddenly warming to Petro is especially surprising since Colombia's president called the U.S. operation in Venezuela an \"abhorrent\" violation of Latin American sovereignty. He also suggested it was committed by \"enslavers\" and constituted a \"spectacle of death\" comparable to Nazi Germany's 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.   \n   Colombia has long been among America's staunchest Latin American allies, a pillar of Washington's counternarcotics strategy abroad. For three decades, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas.   Still, before Trump's conciliatory post, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Colombia for months.   The Trump administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world's cocaine trade.   Trump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.   The U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.   \"He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Petro on Sunday. \"He's not going to be doing it.\"\n",

Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the longest-serving Democrat in Congress and once a rival to become House speaker, will announce Thursday he is set to retire at the end of his term.   \n   Hoyer, who served for years in party leadership and helped steer Democrats through some of their most significant legislative victories, is set to deliver a House floor speech about his decision, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it.   \"Tune in,\" Hoyer said on social media. He confirmed his retirement plans in an interview with The Washington Post.   At 86, Hoyer is the latest in a generation of senior-most leaders stepping aside, making way for a new era of lawmakers eager to take on governing. Retirements have been high in the political parties, Democrats and Republicans, ahead of the midterm elections in November that will determine control of Congress.   \n   First arriving in the House in 1981 after a special election, Hoyer's reach extended beyond his Chesapeake Bay-area district, and he quickly climbed the leadership ranks to become the No. 2 Democrat. He served as majority leader after Democrats swept to power after the 2006 election, and again in 2019 after they regained control during President Donald Trump's first term.   \n   Through those years Hoyer worked as a partner and sometimes rival to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, part of a trio of top Democrats alongside Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina.   That was the era when Democrats, with President Barack Obama, ushered the Affordable Care Act and other signature legislation to law.   During the Trump era, as Democrats worked to win back House control, Hoyer campaigned to court blue-collar voters outside of party strongholds and positioned himself as a potential alternative to Pelosi. For years, Hoyer championed what he called his \"Make it in America\" agenda to boost industry, production and jobs.   But the leaders have often moved in tandem, and when Pelosi announced last fall she would end her own storied career after this term, Hoyer's next step was widely watched.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Council on Foreign Relations President Michael Froman about the U.S. attack on Venezuela, the \"Don-roe\" doctrine and Stephen Miller's statements about Greenland.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Make America great again. That phrase has been in our political ecosystem for 10 years now. But it's never been entirely clear what time period in American history President Trump is referencing. Is it the 1980s, maybe the 1950s? What about further back, say, the 1890s? As we enter the second year of Trump's second term, his major policy decisions and tactics increasingly rival the imperial Gilded Age presidencies of the late 1800s.There's Trump's tariff policies, which echo the Tariff act of 1890. In the late 19th century, many government personnel decisions were made, with no apologies, with two goals in mind - boosting the backers of the party in power and rewarding people and companies who made financial contributions to that ruling party. Back then, it was the railroad industry. Now AI is the billion-dollar industry. And its leaders are courting favors with the Trump White House.Then there's foreign policy. From 1867 to 1899, the United States acquired several territories including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Now, in 2026, President Trump has declared the U.S. will, quote, \"run\" Venezuela after the seizure and ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. And he and top aides like Stephen Miller are talking about other international moves, too, using blunt language about U.S. military force and U.S. raw strategic interests that, by and large, went away in the 20th century. Here's Miller on CNN.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN MILLER: We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world - in the real world, Jake - that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.DETROW: So how is the second Trump administration changing the world order? That's something we are going to discuss with Michael Froman. He is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and served as President Obama's trade representative. Thanks for talking to us.MICHAEL FROMAN: Thanks for having me.DETROW: I want to start with the U.S. military going into Venezuela and seizing its president. What was your response? What did you think about?FROMAN: Well, first, I don't think that there's any great tears to be shed over Maduro, who was a ruthless leader and alleged to be quite corrupt and criminal in his activity. You know, however, going in and decapitating a government certainly seemed at odds with the president's initial views on regime change and getting involved in the internal affairs of other countries. We now have a situation where we've sort of done regime change without, at least so far, changing the regime, in that we've got the rest of the Maduro government - including the defense minister, the interior minister, the vice president, who's now acting president - very much maintaining control.You know, I think from an international perspective, as you said, this hearkens back to a period of time when the U.S. would just declare that it was going to use force or other means to expand or to secure access to resources. I think one of the big questions is, how do other countries interpret this?DETROW: You've talked about a phrase we've heard a lot, the rules-based international order. This is something the Biden administration was very focused on. This is something American allies in Europe talk a lot about, the idea that there is a set rules and standards and countries have to follow them. And the argument you hear from Stephen Miller and others in the Trump White House is that's bogus, that that's a veneer. That's never been true. And foreign policy is about strength and it's about power and it's about the U.S. seizing what it wants. What happens to the world if that's U.S. foreign policy going forward?FROMAN: So, I mean, certainly, power has always been an element of international relations. But post-Second World War, the U.S. decided that it could exert global leadership and it could exert its power most effectively by getting other countries to buy into a set of rules that, more or less, we designed and that served our interests very well for a long period of time. Now, sometimes that involved us constraining our own capacity to act unilaterally, but it certainly prevented other countries from doing that. Or it tried to prevent that.  And no rules-based system is perfect. You know, in the international legal system, I think if most countries follow most of the rules most of the time, it has been deemed a success.DETROW: But does Miller have a point, though, that might've been right all along? Like, the U.S. and its allies have not seen it in their interest to go to war with Russia in Ukraine directly. No one stopped the United States from seizing Maduro. And now Miller is saying, who's going to stop America if it seizes Greenland?FROMAN: So I think Stephen Miller is right that power matters and how you exercise power matters. I think the question is, we have been successful for 80 years in using our power and U.S. leadership to shape a system that all of the other countries bought into, more or less, and that one kept the peace broadly in the world. What this administration has done is said, look, we're going to put that to the side. And we're going to go back in many respects to, as you suggested, an earlier period where what mattered was your hard power and how you exercised it, and whether any other country could stand up to you in doing so.And we do have the largest military in the world. And we do spend more on our military than the next several countries combined. We have real challenges out there, including China, that is engaged in a major military modernization plan and a major military modernization buildout. But we are still the dominant military power in the world. And the question is, how do we use that military power?DETROW: I mean, you're speaking about this very rationally and strategically. But don't we have a lot of evidence at this point that a lot of the decision-making is just, I would like to add to the United States, I would like to leave my mark in one way or another, with the Trump White House and President Trump specifically? Like, it seems like he's talked out loud about that being kind of what - part of the reasons he's taking these actions.FROMAN: Well, look, a little bit like the comment about running Venezuela but basically doing it - or leaving the current government in place and really focusing on a few issues that the U.S. cares a lot about, like oil, and not so much on democracy or on economic reform in Venezuela, etc. I think one could take that same approach to Greenland. I think there are really serious issues of Arctic security. And we ought to be more engaged in the Arctic Circle, particularly with climate change. As the polar ice caps are melting, that becomes a much more viable trade route.And so, you know, we should be more engaged up there for our own national security, and the Danes and the Greenlanders are very happy to cooperate with us. And there's even a framework. There's even agreement between us as to how we would - how we could further build out our cooperation in that area. But I think the president is right. We probably do need to engage much more actively with Greenland and Denmark and ensure that we've got the capacity on Greenland to address our Arctic security needs.DETROW: Has any of this surprised you, based on what President Trump and his top advisers talked about heading into their second term?FROMAN: Yes. I'd say there was a lot of expectation coming into the second term that the president was going to be an isolationist. And he is clearly not an isolationist. He has been deeply engaged internationally from Day 1. And what we've seen is - whether it's regime change in Venezuela or the state building that is slated to go on in Gaza around the ceasefire plan that the president negotiated - that this very much involves active U.S. participation and active personal participation by the president.DETROW: That's Michael Froman, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Thank you so much for talking to us.FROMAN: Thanks for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF HARRY GREGSON-WILLIAMS AND RUPERT GREGSON-WILLIAMS' \"THE GILDED AGE (MAIN TITLE THEME)\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The House is set to vote Thursday on a bill to renew enhanced health insurance subsidies.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Against the wishes of House Speaker Mike Johnson, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a measure that would renew enhanced health insurance subsidies that expired at the end of last year.   The three-year extension is expected to pass the House, but it may not go far in the Senate, where a similar measure failed in December. A bipartisan group of senators, however, say they are close to a deal on a compromise bill for the Affordable Care Act subsidies.   While the debate over health care costs absorbed much of the oxygen in Congress in the final weeks of 2025, the rush to take action on the lapsed subsidies is now happening as members find themselves grappling with questions about the direction of U.S. foreign policy following President Trump's actions in Venezuela. That includes an expected vote in the Senate on Thursday on a resolution to block U.S. forces from further engaging in hostilities against Venezuela without congressional authorization.   \n   Thursday's votes are part of a whirlwind start to the new year for lawmakers. Adding to their to-do list is a fast-approaching Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government or risk a partial shutdown.   An end-run around the speaker on subsidies    Republican leadership for weeks refused to allow a vote on extending the subsidies.   Then just before the holiday recess, four swing-district Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years through what's known as a discharge petition. The once rare legislative tool allows 218 or more rank-and-file members to sidestep the speaker and force a vote.   A procedural motion Wednesday to set up that final House vote won support from nine Republicans.   \n   But even many backers acknowledge a clean three-year extension is unlikely to pass the Senate. The hope has been that success in the House would recharge bipartisan negotiations in the upper chamber, and there are signs that may be happening.   A small bipartisan group of senators have been negotiating this week, and several of them have told reporters they are nearing a deal.   \"We're in the red zone,\" said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, on Wednesday. \"But that does not mean a touchdown. It could mean a 95-yard fumble.\"   \n   The path ahead in the Senate   Moreno says the emerging compromise centers on a two-year extension. In the second year, patients could opt to have the funds deposited in a Health Savings Account, instead of government subsidies going to the insurance company.   President Trump has pushed to give federal funding for health care costs directly to patients and has repeatedly decried the subsidies as government handouts to big insurance companies.   The plan would also include an income cap, among other changes Republicans have called for. Open enrollment would likely be extended so people who dropped their policies due to the premium spikes brought on by the expiration of subsidies can have an opportunity to sign up for coverage.   \n   There are still some sticking points to a bipartisan deal. Some Republicans want more specific language around the prohibition of federal funding being used for abortion.   Trump told House Republicans this week that they may need to be \"flexible on this.\"   And there are also many Republicans deeply opposed to the enhanced subsidies at all, so even if the bipartisan group reaches a compromise, their ultimate fate remains unclear.   A fast start for Congress in 2026   As lawmakers look for consensus on the subsidies, questions about the future of the U.S. role in Venezuela have also taken on new urgency.    On Thursday, the Senate is is scheduled to vote on a resolution that would block military action against Venezuela without congressional approval. The resolution requires a simple majority to pass, but is expected to fall short of that threshold.    A similar measure failed last year, attracting support from two Republicans, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Paul has sponsored the latest effort alongside a trio of Democrats: Tim Kaine of Virginia, Adam Schiff of California and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.    \n   In addition to votes on health care and Venezuela, lawmakers are also facing pressure on funding the government by a deadline of Jan. 30.    Congress has already signed off on full-year funding for some federal agencies, but the record-long government shutdown last fall ended with a continuing resolution that got funding flowing again for most departments only into the first month of the year.   Several of those appropriations bills are slated to come up for votes in the coming days, but appropriators are still working out the details for bills that cover more contentious areas — like the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.   \n   Meanwhile, the House is expected to vote Thursday on overriding two vetoes by President Trump just before the new year — a rare show of pushback from Republicans in Congress. One veto deals with water infrastructure in Colorado, while the other affects a Native American tribe in Florida.\n",

For decades, the landmark law that came out of the Civil Rights Movement has protected the collective voting power of racial minorities when political maps are redrawn. Its provisions have also boosted the number of seats in the House of Representatives filled by Black lawmakers.   That's largely because in many Southern states — where voting is often polarized between a Republican-supporting white majority and a Democratic-supporting Black minority — political mapmakers have drawn a certain kind of district to get in line with the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 provisions. In these districts, racial-minority voters make up a population large enough to have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates.   \n   But at an October hearing last year for the redistricting case about Louisiana's congressional map, the Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared inclined to issue this year another in a series of decisions that have weakened the Voting Rights Act — this time its Section 2 protections in redistricting.   That kind of ruling could put at risk at least 15 House districts currently represented by a Black member of Congress, an NPR analysis has found. Each of those districts has a sizable racial-minority population, is in a state where Republican lawmakers control redistricting and, for now at least, is likely protected by Section 2. Factoring in newly redrawn districts in Missouri and Texas, which were not included in NPR's analysis, could raise the tally of at-risk districts higher.   Loading...\n   If Republican-led states no longer have to follow current redistricting provisions under Section 2, it's unclear how many Democratic-represented districts could be eliminated, because GOP-led legislatures may see a partisan advantage in preserving some of those districts. The timing of such moves is also unclear, as state lawmakers await the Supreme Court ruling.   Still, the loss of even a handful of those at-risk districts could fuel a record drop in the number of Black representatives. The current record drop was set by the 45th Congress, which began in 1877 and had four fewer House districts represented by Black lawmakers than the previous session.   How Black representation in Congress has grown after the Civil War   The post-Civil War Reconstruction era brought the start of Black representation on Capitol Hill in 1870, around the time when Black men gained the right to vote. The rise of racist poll taxes, literacy tests and threats of violence, however, whittled away the rights of Black voters until the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   \n   For a century after the Civil War, the number of Black-represented House districts in each Congress stayed in the single digits or at zero. That continued until 1969, when the number began gradually increasing through today to 63 districts, or about 14% of the current House.   Loading...\n   What the Supreme Court decides in the Louisiana case will set the stage for where that trend line goes.   At the center of the case is one of the state's two majority-Black congressional districts. Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature drew it after a related Section 2 lawsuit led by Press Robinson, a Black voter and civil rights activist in Baton Rouge.   Robinson says he fears that without Section 2's protections, Black representation in Congress and at other levels of government will be diminished to \"a very minor scale.\"   \"And that is not where we should be in 2026,\" adds Robinson, who became the first Black elected member of the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board in 1980 after filing a federal lawsuit over the board's use of an election system that he argued diluted the power of Black voters.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Press Robinson, a civil rights activist, sits at his desk in his home in Baton Rouge, La., on Aug. 24, 2022. Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature drew a second majority-Black congressional district after Robinson and other Black voters in the state sued.\n                \n                    Gerald Herbert/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gerald Herbert/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Robinson's concerns about Section 2's future have been echoed by current members of Congress.   \"For so many of us here today, Section 2 is why we stand before you as members of the Congressional Black Caucus,\" said Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama at a press conference, after the Supreme Court's October hearing for the Louisiana case. \"If this court strikes down these critical provisions, it would not only reverse decades of precedent, but it would also take us back to a dark time in our nation's history, a time when discrimination against minority voters went unchecked.\"   Opponents of those Section 2 provisions claim, however, that they violate the Constitution.   In the Supreme Court case, Louisiana's Republican state officials say race should play no role \"in any form\" when redrawing voting maps. A group of self-described \"non-African American\" voters from the state argue that the court should put an end to race-based redistricting under Section 2 now that it has ruled against race-based affirmative action at colleges and universities. Similarly, the Justice Department under the Trump administration has criticized the use of Section 2 provisions in redistricting as \"a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends.\"   \n   A weakening of Section 2 could also reduce Latino representation   Additional restrictions on how race can be factored into redistricting could give political mapmakers more leeway to neutralize the collective power of minority voters and lead to fewer representatives of color getting elected, says Katherine Tate, a professor of political science at Brown University.   \"Minority members of Congress are more likely to sponsor bills that talk about minority interests, even controlling for political party. So diversity really is important in terms of fair representation, equal representation of American voters,\" explains Tate, who has written books about Black representation in Congress.   \n   Any weakening of Section 2's current redistricting provisions also puts at risk representation by other racial and ethnic minorities and at lower levels of government.   As much as 11% of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could be lost, and close to 200 Democratic-held state legislative seats, mostly representing majority-Black districts in the South, could be eliminated, according to estimates by the voting rights advocacy groups Fair Fight Action and Black Voters Matter Fund.   Those changes may play out over years, says Lauren Groh-Wargo, Fair Fight Action's CEO.   \"We could see a very rapid, effective dismantling of Black representation at the congressional level and possibly at the state legislative level in a couple of states. I think other states may hold off and wait to do their gerrymandering\" until the current wave of mid-decade congressional redistricting is over, Groh-Wargo adds.   It's \"always a fight\"   Tate, the political scientist at Brown University, sees the Louisiana redistricting case returning the Supreme Court to a role from more than 150 years ago.   Tate recalls the series of court decisions beginning in the 1870s that eroded the civil rights gains of the Reconstruction era for Black citizens, including millions of formerly enslaved people. Now, the court is weighing the fate of a key remaining section of the Voting Rights Act — a legacy of the Civil Rights Movement that historians consider a second Reconstruction.   \n   \"It'll be like the first Reconstruction, why that failed — because of the Supreme Court rulings,\" Tate says. \"The end of the second Reconstruction will be because of the Supreme Court.\"   For Robinson of Baton Rouge, it's all a reminder that the struggle for fair representation never ends.   \"When it comes to voting rights and other rights for people of color, it's always a fight,\" Robinson says. \"There's never a time that we get what we deserve and that we should have without having to fight for it.\"   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

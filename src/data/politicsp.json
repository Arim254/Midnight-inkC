Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2025, at the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON (AP) — Approaching the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the official plaque honoring the police who defended democracy that day is nowhere to be found.   It's not on display at the Capitol, as is required by law. Its whereabouts aren't publicly known, though it's believed to be in storage.   \n   House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has yet to formally unveil the plaque. And the Trump administration's Department of Justice is seeking to dismiss a police officers' lawsuit asking that it be displayed as intended. The Architect of the Capitol, which was responsible for obtaining and displaying the plaque, said in light of the federal litigation, it cannot comment.   Determined to preserve the nation's history, some 100 members of Congress, mostly Democrats, have taken it upon themselves to memorialize the moment. For months, they've mounted poster board-style replicas of the Jan. 6 plaque outside their office doors, resulting in a Capitol complex awash with makeshift remembrances.   \n   \"On behalf of a grateful Congress, this plaque honors the extraordinary individuals who bravely protected and defended this symbol of democracy on Jan. 6, 2021,\" reads the faux bronze stand-in for the real thing. \"Their heroism will never be forgotten.\"   Jan. 6 void in the Capitol   In Washington, a capital city lined with monuments to the nation's history, the plaque was intended to become a simple but permanent marker, situated near the Capitol's west front, where some of the most violent fighting took place as rioters breached the building.   But in its absence, the missing plaque makes way for something else entirely — a culture of forgetting.   Visitors can pass through the Capitol without any formal reminder of what happened that day, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building trying to overturn the Republican's 2020 reelection defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. With memory left unchecked, it allows new narratives to swirl and revised histories to take hold.   Five years ago, the jarring scene watched the world over was declared an \"insurrection\" by the then-GOP leader of the Senate, while the House GOP leader at the time called it his \"saddest day\" in Congress. But those condemnations have faded.   Trump calls it a \"day of love.\" And Johnson, who was among those lawmakers challenging the 2020 election results, is now the House speaker.   \n   \"The question of January 6 remains – democracy was on the guillotine — how important is that event in the overall sweep of 21st century U.S. history,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University and noted scholar.   \"Will January 6 be seen as the seminal moment when democracy was in peril?\" he asked. Or will it be remembered as \"kind of a weird one-off?\"   \"There's not as much consensus on that as one would have thought on the fifth anniversary,\" he said.   Memories shift, but violent legacy lingers   At least five people died in the riot and its aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by police while trying to climb through a window toward the House chamber. More than 140 law enforcement officers were wounded, some gravely, and several died later, some by suicide.   All told, some 1,500 people were charged in the Capitol attack, among the largest federal prosecutions in the nation's history. When Trump returned to power in January 2025, he pardoned all of them within hours of taking office.   Unlike the twin light beams that commemorated the Sept. 11, 2001, attack or the stand-alone chairs at the Oklahoma City bombing site memorial, the failure to recognize Jan. 6 has left a gap not only in memory but in helping to stitch the country back together.   \"That's why you put up a plaque,\" said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa. \"You respect the memory and the service of the people involved.\"   Police sue over Jan. 6 plaque, DOJ seeks to dismiss   The speaker's office said in a statement late Monday the statute authorizing the plaque is \"not implementable\" and proposed alternatives also \"do not comply.\" Johnson's spokesman said if Democrats are serious about commemorating the police, they're free to work with the appropriate committees to develop a framework for proper vetting and consideration.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A replica plaque commemorating the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot hangs outside the office of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2025, at the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Lawmakers approved the plaque in March 2022 as part of a broader government funding package. The resolution said the U.S. \"owes its deepest gratitude to those officers,\" and it set out instructions for an honorific plaque listing the names of officers \"who responded to the violence that occurred.\" It gave a one-year deadline for installation at the Capitol.   \n   This summer, two officers who fought the mob that day sued over the delay.   \"By refusing to follow the law and honor officers as it is required to do, Congress encourages this rewriting of history,\" said the claim by officers Harry Dunn and Daniel Hodges. \"It suggests that the officers are not worthy of being recognized, because Congress refuses to recognize them.\"   The Justice Department is seeking to have the case dismissed. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro and others argued Congress \"already has publicly recognized the service of law enforcement personnel\" by approving the plaque and displaying it wouldn't alleviate the problems they claim to face from their work.   \"It is implausible,\" the Justice Department attorneys wrote, to suggest installation of the plaque \"would stop the alleged death threats they claim to have been receiving.\"   The department also said the plaque is required to include the names of \"all law enforcement officers\" involved in the response that day — some 3,600 people.   Makeshift memorials emerge   Lawmakers who've installed replicas of the plaque outside their offices said it's important for the public to know what happened.   \"There are new generations of people who are just growing up now who don't understand how close we came to losing our democracy on Jan 6, 2021,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Jan. 6 committee, which was opposed by GOP leadership but nevertheless issued a nearly 1,000-page report investigating the run-up to the attack and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election.   Raskin envisions the Capitol one day holding tours around what happened. \"People need to study that as an essential part of American history,\" he said.   \"Think about the dates in American history that we know only by the dates: There's the 4th of July. There's December 7th. There's 9/11. And there's January 6th,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-calif., who also served on the committee and has a plaque outside her office.   \n   \"They really saved my life, and they saved the democracy and they deserve to be thanked for it,\" she said.   But as time passes, there are no longer bipartisan memorial services for Jan. 6. On Tuesday, the Democrats will reconvene members from the Jan. 6 committee for a hearing to \"examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York announced. It's unlikely Republicans will participate.   The Republicans under Johnson have tapped Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia to stand up their own special committee to uncover what the speaker calls the \"full truth\" of what happened. They're planning a hearing this month.   \"We should stop this silliness of trying to whitewash history -- it's not going to happen,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who helped lead the effort to display the replica plaques.   \"I was here that day so I'll never forget,\" he said. \"I think that Americans will not forget what happened.\"   The number of makeshift plaques that fill the halls is a testimony to that remembrance, he said.   Instead of one plaque, he said, they've \"now got 100.\"\n",

Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., speaks at a news conference in the Capitol on Dec. 1, 2025. Kelly held the event to address what he described as intimidating actions by President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, following the release of a video in which Kelly and several lawmakers urge U.S. troops to refuse \"illegal orders.\"\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is pledging to fight back after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced he's taking administrative action against Kelly.    Hegseth claims that Kelly's public statements, including a video message telling troops not to follow illegal orders, amount to sedition.   In a statement on social media, the defense secretary said that he has initiated a formal 45-day process to reduce Kelly's rank and retirement pay.   \"In response to Senator Mark Kelly's seditious statements — and his pattern of reckless misconduct — the Department of War is taking administrative action against Captain Mark E. Kelly, USN (Ret),\" Hegseth's statement reads.    \n   This administrative action will include a review of Kelly's retirement grade, which could result in a change or reduction to his rank, \"resulting in a corresponding reduction in retired pay.\"   \n   Hegseth also announced he issued a formal censure letter that will be placed in Kelly's official military file.    In response, Kelly issued a statement saying that he had earned his rank in combat and as an astronaut and that Hegseth and the Trump administration were trying to stifle free speech and dissent among retired military officers.    \"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head — all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly said.    \"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way. It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that,\" Kelly added.   The Arizona senator said he won't be intimidated by censure or threats to his rank and retirement. He stated he plans to fight the action.     \n   \"I will fight this with everything I've got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.\"   Before serving as a U.S. senator, Kelly spent 25 years as a Navy pilot and retired with full military benefits. That status makes him subject to the military code of justice. The Pentagon launched an investigation into Kelly in November.\n",

Higgins on Saturday said the Trump administration ending TPS for Venezuelans in early 2025 was \"reckless, dangerous, and wrong.\" She also called for President Trump to \"immediately\" reinstate TPS for Venezuelans.   \n   Miami has a large population of Venezuelan expats. Higgins was sworn in as mayor last month, becoming the first Democrat to lead the city in about three decades.   \"The instability unfolding in Venezuela today makes it even clearer that the country remains unsafe for people to return. No one should be forced back into chaos and uncertainty,\" Higgins wrote in a statement. \"They have built lives here, contributed to our community, and deserve the security to remain while their homeland regains stability. This is not just a matter of policy — it is a matter of basic human dignity and safety.\"   \n   The U.S. Supreme Court in May allowed the Trump administration to temporarily strip legal protections from more than 350,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. under TPS, which protects against deportations and provides work permits to people impacted by war, natural disasters and other circumstances.   \n   In October, the high court granted the administration's request to halt a lower court order that blocked the end of TPS protections for Venezuelans — allowing the administration to move forward with ending the TPS designation for the country.   When asked about Higgins' statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the administration ending the program, saying Sunday that decisions are made in collaboration with the State Department and White House.   \"Every individual that was under TPS has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward, but we need to make sure that our programs actually mean something and that we are following the law,\" Noem said during an interview with Fox News.   The Department of Homeland Security also said in a social media post later on Sunday: \"Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love.\"   At least 7.9 million people have fled Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.\n",

    "body": "\n      The discharge petition is a way to force votes by sidestepping the Speaker. For decades it was mostly forgotten, but has been brought back for bills on the Epstein files and to extend ACA subsidies.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Here in Washington, Congress is back this week, and one of the first tasks for the House of Representatives is a vote - a vote on a bill to renew now-expired health insurance subsidies, despite objections from Speaker Mike Johnson. Now, this is not the first time this - in this Congress that enough Republicans have joined with Democrats to circumvent the speaker using a previously obscure maneuver called a discharge petition. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas explains.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Speaker Johnson for weeks refused to allow a vote to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, even as more than a dozen members of his caucus pressed for action before they expired at the end of December. Some of those Republicans, like Congressman Mike Lawler of New York, were fuming.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL LAWLER: It is idiotic and shameful. This place is disgraceful. Everybody wants the political advantage. They don't actually want to do the damn work.GRINGLAS: So just before Congress left town for the holidays, Lawler and three other swing district Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on a three-year extension. The method, a discharge petition, which allows 218 or more members to sidestep the speaker and force a vote in the House. The subsidies would still have to pass the Senate, which already voted down a three-year extension. But Lawler told NPR that for him, the petition was a last resort to recharge negotiations.LAWLER: I don't want to go down this road, but unfortunately, we were left with no alternative after we exhausted every other option.GRINGLAS: Use of the discharge petition is surging. In the fall, five Republicans joined with Democrats to compel a vote overturning President Trump's order ending collective bargaining rights for many federal workers. A discharge petition also forced a vote mandating the Trump administration release the investigative files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.MOLLY REYNOLDS: The last time we had a Congress that had this much success with the discharge petition, oh, it was 90 years ago.GRINGLAS: That was during the Great Depression, says Molly Reynolds of the Brookings Institution. The tool originated two decades earlier as rank-and-file members struggled to push back on then-speaker Joseph Cannon.REYNOLDS: Sometimes referred to as Czar Cannon, to give you a sense of how members felt about the amount of power he was trying to exercise.GRINGLAS: But unlike those members more than a century ago, lawmakers today see Johnson less as an iron-fisted ruler and more as a speaker missing in action. In announcing her exit from Congress, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene slammed Johnson for letting bills by the rank and file collect dust and keeping the House out for the entire 43-day shutdown.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: The legislature has been mostly sidelined. And we are entering campaign season, which means all courage leaves and only safe campaign reelection mode is turned on in the House of Representatives.GRINGLAS: The willingness of some Republicans to buck their speaker has also given Democrats unusual sway to force votes advancing their own agenda. Johnson has brushed off the flurry of successful discharge petitions as unavoidable when it only takes a few defections.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: This is not a challenge to the speaker's leadership. Here's the reality, everybody. We have a razor-thin majority - a record small majority.GRINGLAS: Johnson spoke to reporters in December.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: It's not an act of defiance. Every member has a different district with different dynamics and different demographics.GRINGLAS: But Mike Ricci, who served as a top staffer under former Republican speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, says there's more to the story.MIKE RICCI: If members don't trust the speaker, they don't feel like the speaker has their back, there's no question this is a direct referendum on the speaker himself.GRINGLAS: Ricci says both Boehner and Ryan sometimes struggled to wrangle unwieldy Republican caucuses.RICCI: It was unruly, but it was not unproductive. With enough talking, with enough back and forth, we could figure out a path forward to keep the House moving.GRINGLAS: In this era, some members now see the discharge petition as the tool to keep the House moving. And with a growing track record of success, more may be on the way.Sam Gringlas, NPR News, Washington.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, about the Trump administration's military operation in Venezuela.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Now, President Trump acted in Venezuela without the approval of Congress, asserting that no such approval was needed. Lawmakers now decide how, if at all, to respond. And one of them is Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, good morning.JIM HIMES: Good morning.INSKEEP: I was home in Indiana when this strike took place over the weekend, and people in my family said, well, obviously, they can't get permission of Congress in advance in a case like this. It would leak. And I said, well, there is this Gang of Eight, eight top lawmakers, and normally the administration would keep them informed. You're one of the Gang of Eight. Were you informed?HIMES: No. No. In fact, you know, I was woken up by my wife who said, you won't believe what's happening. And to this moment, I have actually not received any outreach at all from the administration. So, look, the decision was taken here, and this whole leak thing is baloney. I don't think the Gang of Eight has ever leaked. But this, you know, obviously, very inconsistent with the idea that Congress has a role to play, when the - you know, probably the role to play when the United States military is engaged. And as a political matter, you know, a little unwise 'cause it's hard to imagine this adventure going, you know, horribly right in the coming months. And, you know, because he - the president did this without any input from anybody else, he owns this 100% now.INSKEEP: Why do you think that there's not a good chance that this could go right?HIMES: Well, point to me in the last generation one incident - one instance of the United States effecting regime change and having everything go well. You just can't, right? You can point to Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya. In some ways, the best, I think, the administration can hope for is a sort of a Grenada situation where, you know, no one sort of people lose track because, I mean, who remembers Grenada back in the early '80s, right? That's the best-case scenario, especially when it's completely evident at this point that the president has no plan. He says we're running Venezuela, but apparently, that means we've got a lot of firepower off the coast and are trying to get the vice president very much a Chavista leader, very much part of the old regime, to do what we want because we've got a lot of guns.INSKEEP: Let me talk that through with you, though. You point out that nation building has not worked well at all for the United States, given the risks of trying to create some brand-new government or install the opposition leader as president, could the U.S. be wise to leave the current government in place and just give some orders?HIMES: Well, that would probably be wise - well, it would certainly be wiser than putting the 50,000 armed forces on the ground that would be required to effect a full regime change. You know, and then, of course, you know, there's all sorts of questions of what happens with the Venezuelan military - a lot of guns there. Huge political risk for the president, right? I mean, President Biden's administration never recovered from the visual image of 12 Marines dying at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan. So huge risk. But, you know, you have to remember the Venezuelan regime has its politics, too. It can't be perceived as a puppet of the American administration, which quite explicitly says it wants their oil. So this is going to be, I think, a lot harder than Donald Trump thinks that it will be.INSKEEP: What should the role be for the opposition, the president-elect, according to the United States, the man who won the election in 2024, or María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner who is the opposition leader?HIMES: Well, that was the fascinating thing to me about the news conference, right? The president said two things that I think probably fatally damaged this adventure. On the one hand, he did something that Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz at their neocon peak would never have done, which is to say this is about oil. I mean, you have to understand how that sounds to Venezuelans and to the rest of the world. This is not about our democracy or our prosperity. It's about the United States taking the oil. And secondly, the president delegitimized probably the single unifying force in Venezuela in the form of Mrs. Machado, who won a Nobel Peace Prize. The president cut the ground out from under her. So, you know, now Venezuelans are thinking, wait a minute, do I get to live with this appalling regime, but now United States gets the oil? You know, I mean, this is just - the president, I think, probably fatally wounded whatever chance this effort had in saying those two things in his news conference.INSKEEP: Briefly, what will your approach be now that the president is also threatening the leader of Colombia and talking again about taking over Greenland, among other things?HIMES: Well, you know, clearly, Congress needs to do something that it has not done because it's been under the control of the president's acolytes for the last, you know, year or so, which is to assert itself, to say we are the legitimate representatives of the people, and you're now talking about using those people on foreign adventures that would have made Teddy Roosevelt blush. So, you know, again, we're in the minority in the House and the Senate, but it is time for this Congress to stand up and say we have a role to play here.INSKEEP: Jim Himes of Connecticut is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, thanks so much.HIMES: Thank you. Take care.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Her comments came in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed call for the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island to come under U.S. control in the aftermath of the weekend military operation in Venezuela.   \n   The dead-of-night operation by U.S. forces in Caracas to capture leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife early Saturday left the world stunned, and heightened concerns in Denmark and Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of the Danish kingdom and thus part of NATO.   Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens Frederik Nielsen, blasted the president's comments and warned of catastrophic consequences. Numerous European leaders expressed solidarity with them.   \n   \"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"   20-day timeline deepens fears   Trump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the island. His comments Sunday, including telling reporters \"let's talk about Greenland in 20 days,\" further deepened fears that the U.S. was planning an intervention in Greenland in the near future.   Frederiksen also said Trump \"should be taken seriously\" when he says he wants Greenland. \"We will not accept a situation where we and Greenland are threatened in this way,\" she added.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                FILE - In this Aug. 16, 2019, photo, large Icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.\n                \n                    Felipe Dana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Felipe Dana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Nielsen, in a news conference Monday, said Greenland cannot be compared to Venezuela. He urged his constituents to stay calm and united.   \"We are not in a situation where we think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation,\" he said.   Nielsen added: \"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland.\"   \n   Ask Rostrup, a TV2 political journalist, wrote on the station's live blog Monday that Mette previously would have flatly rejected the idea of an American takeover of Greenland. But now, Rostrup wrote, the rhetoric has escalated so much that she has to acknowledge the possibility.   Trump slams Denmark's security efforts in Greenland   Trump on Sunday also mocked Denmark's efforts at boosting Greenland's national security posture, saying the Danes have added \"one more dog sled\" to the Arctic territory's arsenal.   \"It's so strategic right now,\" Trump had told reporters Sunday as he flew back to Washington from his home in Florida. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\"   \n   He added: \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"   But Ulrik Pram Gad, a global security expert from the Danish Institute for International Studies, wrote in a report last year that \"there are indeed Russian and Chinese ships in the Arctic, but these vessels are too far away to see from Greenland with or without binoculars.\"   U.S. space base in northwestern Greenland   Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled this weekend by a social media post following the raid by a former Trump administration official turned podcaster, Katie Miller. The post shows an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: \"SOON.\"   \"And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" Ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark's chief envoy to Washington, said in a post responding to Miller, who is married to Trump's influential deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.   The U.S. Department of Defense operates the remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland. It was built following a 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. It supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.   On Denmark's mainland, the partnership between the U.S. and Denmark has been long-lasting. The Danes buy American F-35 fighter jets and just last year, Denmark's parliament approved a bill to allow U.S. military bases on Danish soil.   Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish air bases in the Scandinavian country.\n",

On Polymarket, a popular site for making bets on the outcome of real world events, a user wagered $32,000 that Maduro would be toppled by the end of January hours before Trump ordered the operation. When it was clear the U.S. had captured Maduro, the trader made more than $400,000 in profit.   Was the trader just lucky, or privy to classified government deliberations? For now, it's impossible to tell.   Online sleuths have attempted to identify this trader with no luck. The account, which originally went by the handle \"Burdensome-Mix\" before changing its display name to a string of letters and numbers, joined Polymarket just weeks ahead of making the Maduro trade.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A screenshot of the mysterious Polymarket user's accounts with their recent trades on Maduro's ouster.\n                \n                    NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Most traders on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi place bets under pseudonyms, not their real names. Yet if the accounts are linked to cryptocurrency wallets, it is sometimes possible to unmask a user.   \n   Chainalysis, a company that tracks crypto theft, told NPR it cannot determine the person behind the account, but noted that they are using several U.S. crypto exchanges to cash out, suggesting they are not trying to conceal their identity by funneling money through shadowy overseas exchanges, something that is typical in crypto fraud schemes.   \"Was it insider trading? Hard to say,\" said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies insider trading and corporate fraud. \"It's easier in hindsight to pick out things that look suspicious than to pick them out in real time.\"   In the case of the person who placed the lucrative Maduro wager, the mystery rages on, but it has sparked debate about the potential for insider trading on prediction markets, where financial experts say abuse can go unnoticed by federal regulators.   Unlike the stock market, where the Securities and Exchange Commission polices market activity for potential insider trading, far fewer guardrails are in place to keep prediction markets in line.   Polymarket and its rival, Kalshi, fall under the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The agency can enforce anti-fraud rules including instances of insider trading. But the agency has about one-eighth the staff of the SEC, despite Kalshi alone receiving more than $2 billion in trades in a single week.   \n   The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., is an adviser to both Polymarket and Kalshi, which makes some experts skeptical that the agency will ever go too hard on the companies.   \"Given the conflicted relationship of the First Family,\" said Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, \"CFTC oversight could be compromised.\"   Yash Kanoria, a professor at Columbia Business School, agreed that the companies' ties to the Trump administration undermine faith that regulators will aggressively monitor the platforms for traders seeking to rig bets.    \"We need them to be invested in weeding out bad activity like insider trading, without any distracting influences,\" he said.    The CFTC and Polymarket did not return requests for comment.    Kalshi said in a statement that the platform prohibits insider trader \"including government employees trading on prediction markets related to government activity.\" Similarly, Polymarket's rules prohibit market manipulation more generally.   The Biden administration cracked down on prediction markets, fighting them in court over allowing bets on U.S. elections and pushing back against sports betting, which is outlawed in nearly 20 states.   Trump's regulators have taken the opposite approach. The Justice Department and CFTC have dropped investigations into prediction markets. Trump's own social media site, TruthSocial, has announced plans to introduce its own prediction market.   There have been other instances of potential insider trading on Polymarket, like when someone netted nearly $1 million by correctly betting on what 22 out of 23 of Google's most-searched terms would be last year.   The University of Pennsylvania's Taylor says even if it can be shown that someone used non-public information to make money on a prediction market, a successful prosecution would hinge on showing harm.   \"How would the U.S. government be harmed by someone trading on advanced warning of the Maduro operation?\" he said. \"If you can't show that you're depriving someone of value, it's going to be a very difficult case.\"   \n   Have information you want to share about the Maduro trade or insider trading on prediction markets?

The move comes less than a week after HHS confirmed it was freezing all federal funding through that same program.   The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) sends money to states, tribes and territories to help make child care more affordable for low-income families.   The Biden administration's rules encouraged states to base payments to child care providers on enrollment rather than verified attendance, pay providers in advance of services and favor guaranteed slots with providers over vouchers.   \n   Now, HHS says it plans to restore attendance-based billing, it will no longer require that providers be paid in advance and it will reprioritize vouchers.   \"When controls are not in place, bad actors can bill for children who aren't there,\" said Alex Adams, assistant secretary for family support at HHS's Administration for Children and Families. \"Families and taxpayers deserve proof that services are being delivered to children.\"   But child care advocates told NPR that states already have many controls in place to prevent fraud.   \"What we know to be true is that there are longstanding program integrity requirements that have been in place and are regularly updated, annually updated,\" said Susan Gale Perry, CEO of Child Care Aware of America, which helps families access affordable child care across the country.   Approximately 1.4 million children and 857,700 families per month received child care assistance through CCDF in 2019, according to the latest data posted on the HHS website.   Melissa Boteach, chief policy officer at Zero to Three, a nonprofit that advocates for infants, toddlers and families, said the proposed policy changes introduce \"chaos and confusion\" by rolling back provisions that aimed to make the child care industry more stable and affordable.   This follows a funding freeze announced over the holidays   Monday's announcement comes days after HHS said it was freezing the federal funding provided through CCDF.   \n   HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told NPR on Wednesday that the agency was freezing CCDF funds effective immediately, and said the agency would unfreeze funding after individual states provided certain \"administrative data.\"   \"It's still unclear to many states who have to administer these programs what exactly this means.\" Boteach said. \"And that lack of clarity has real consequences for families and for early educators.\"   She also said there has \"not been clarity provided on whether or not funding is forthcoming, on what needs to be done for it to turn back on and what states are supposed to do in the meantime.\"   HHS has not yet responded to NPR's request for clarity on how Monday's announcement relates to the funding freeze.   \"What we do know is that child care providers operate on [a] very thin … margin of profit,\" said Perry of Child Care Aware of America.   She said going \"even a month\" without funding could result in child care centers closing – which would impact both children who benefit from CCDF funding and those who do not.   A focus on child care providers in Minnesota   The recent focus on federal child care funding comes in response to allegations of fraud by Minnesota day care providers.   \n   As NPR has reported, the day after Christmas, Nick Shirley, a right-wing social media influencer, posted a video in which he claimed to show Somali-American-run day care centers cheating the federal government out of millions of dollars. The video doesn't offer clear proof, but it went viral.   On Dec. 30, HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill posted on X about \"the serious allegations that the state of Minnesota has funneled millions of taxpayer dollars to fraudulent daycares across Minnesota over the past decade.\" He announced actions \"against the blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country,\" including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"   \n   In Monday's HHS announcement, O'Neill said, \"The reforms we are enacting will make fraud harder to perpetrate.\"   According to HHS, the rule changes are subject to a 30-day public comment period.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, about what Congress may do in response to the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  What is the role of Congress as this whole Venezuela situation unfolds? Senior members of the Trump administration are on Capitol Hill today to brief lawmakers. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia is among those asking questions. He's the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. We have him on the line from Capitol Hill. Senator, Happy New Year. Good to speak with you.MARK WARNER: Thank you, Mary Louise. Happy New Year to you as well.KELLY: Chairman of the joint chiefs, the attorney general, the CIA director, defense secretary all briefing Congress today. What do you want to know?WARNER: Well, first of all, I do want to acknowledge that getting Maduro out of the government of Venezuela - he was a bad guy, and candidly, we should have worked more strongly with the Venezuelan people when they voted overwhelmingly against him in 2024. But that still begs the question of what next? You know, the president says we're going to run Venezuela. For how long? How? If we're going to do it literally with troops on the ground or somehow with simply a fleet threatening offshore? I've got questions about how we got here in terms of the intelligence community's role. I want to get clarification on that. I, of course, won't be able to share that, but I want to get that information.And then, you know, we have heard this theory before that we're going to come into a country, i.e., Iraq, and they're going to pay for - the Iraqi oil will pay for the whole occupation. And it appears that the president's making the same claim about Venezuelan oil. How is that going to take place? I mean, the Venezuelan oil fields that used to produce 4 million barrels a day, they're now down to 1 million. Everything I've read has said that it would take two to three years to get those back operational back to previous levels. Are we there for that long a time?KELLY: So you have questions about the budget and who's going to pay for this? Go on.WARNER: The budget on this. And finally, just, you know, on a broader basis, you know, the enormous precedent this sets if, suddenly, we can go in and snatch a leader if they have violated our law. What would then stop Putin using that same theory of the case to take out Zelenskyy from Kyiv, or what would stop President Xi from taking Taiwan since Chinese law has said that Taiwan is simply a breakaway province?KELLY: I mean, you're raising a very big-picture question about the global order shifting as we speak. What's the answer to that question? If the U.S. claims the Western Hemisphere, why wouldn't Russia be free to do the same in Europe?WARNER: That's why I'm going to ask the question. If you follow the logic, there would not be any preclusion. And let's - I think, you know, for the last 70-plus years - basically, since the 60s - I think America - it didn't matter whether it was a Democratic or Republican administration - has tried to build a new kind of arrangement with Central America and South America where we looked at those countries as partners. I've always been interested - I was an exchange student in Argentina. I'm fascinated with the region. I think we've treated them, frankly, badly, year in and year out. Benign neglect. But the notion that we're kind of reintroducing a colonial/imperial sphere of influence towards everything in the Western Hemisphere, that seems to go against everything over the last 70 years in terms of American foreign policy.KELLY: I want to ask about the lack of congressional authorization for this Venezuela attack. Now, Secretary of State Rubio maintains this was not, in fact, an attack. This was a law enforcement operation, and therefore no congressional authorization was needed. Do you buy that?WARNER: No, I don't. You know, I worked well with Secretary Rubio. We were good partners when he was on the Intel Committee. And he did - let me be clear - he did try to reach me after the strike had started. We didn't connect, but he did try to reach me. But the idea that somehow this was a law enforcement action, it doesn't pass the smell test. We had a whole fleet off the coast of Venezuela. When you send in the Delta Force, our top military operatives, into a nation-state to extract their leader, that is not a law enforcement action. And I don't know how we can credibly make that case.KELLY: And when President Trump is threatening that there will be additional action if Venezuela doesn't cooperate going forward, you would argue congressional authorization will be needed for that?WARNER: I would say, of course, there needs to be. And Senator Kaine will have a war powers resolution on Venezuela up this...KELLY: This is your colleague, Senator Tim Kaine.WARNER: Yes.KELLY: Yep.WARNER: I will vote for that. I'm sure most of the - all of the Democrats will vote for it. And the question I have, you know, in terms of congressional oversight, it only works if it's truly bipartisan. And I had so many of my Republican colleagues, particularly in the last few weeks after the elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, start to say, well, you know, they maybe willing to speak up more. It'll be very curious to see whether my Republican friends are going to simply continue to write a blank check to this president to take this kind of really significant action without any approval or even prewarning to Congress.KELLY: Stay with that. Senator Kaine, who you mentioned, has tried to get this war powers resolution passed in past. He's not been able to do so 'cause he doesn't have Republican votes. You would need four. Do you see any sign that your Republican colleagues are likely to line up in blocking the president when they have not done so very often at all in the last year?WARNER: It is - it's a new year, and hope springs eternal. But if I'm laying a wager, I'm not sure. But it's - the question is, what kind of action is going to finally spur them into activity?KELLY: One more question for you, Senator Warner, and it has to do with the overarching goal here. We were told - Americans were told - for months that the U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela was about drugs, that this was about protecting Americans by fighting drug trafficking. President Trump didn't mention drugs very often in his address from Mar-a-Lago over the weekend. He now seems to be focused on oil. Is it clear to you from your perch in the U.S. Senate what the U.S. endgame is?WARNER: It is not clear to me. And matter of fact, if you look at the indictment of Maduro, out of the Southern District of New York, it doesn't even mention fentanyl at all, which is, again, the drug that is doing the most damage in our country. I think, unfortunately, this is about oil. I think this was ill-advised. I don't think there was a real plan. I do think our military executed brilliantly, and Maduro off the stage is good. But, you know, if we really want a collaborative relationship with Venezuela - which we had for many, many decades - we also ought to be interested in the welfare of the Venezuelan people. And this does not bode well for us. It doesn't bode well for the Venezuelans. It doesn't bode well for regional stability.KELLY: Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. Senator, thank you.WARNER: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD AND GHOSTFACE KILLAH SONG, \"STREET KNOWLEDGE\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A hard pinch and a cup of coffee later, and reality set in. But questions remain.   So what does this mean politically, and what should Americans make of what happened?   Here are some takeaways as the dust settles on Caracas:   1. It was an audacious and surprising move for a president who campaigned against American intervention.    Donald Trump, the \"America First\" candidate and president, has turned out to be rather hawkish. In less than 12 months in office this second time around, he's conducted strikes in seven countries — Iran, Nigeria, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and, this weekend, oversaw a daring middle-of-the-night raid in Venezuela. U.S. forces captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, sending them to New York to stand trial for drug trafficking.   \n   To call the action surprising and eye-opening doesn't quite do it justice, especially considering Trump made his bones in opposition to neoconservatives' \"endless wars\" and nation-building in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.   On Saturday, Trump said the United States is going to \"run\" the country until he finds a suitable leader.   \"Well, we're gonna be running it with a group,\" Trump said, \"and we're gonna make sure it's run properly.\"   He noted that \"people that are standing right behind me\" are going to run it. That included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.   Rubio on Sunday tried to walk that back some, describing what the U.S. is doing as a \"quarantine,\" meant to effect \"policy.\"   \n   2. Like Iraq, there have been shifting justifications for removing Maduro.    As the United States was about to commit to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein from Iraq 20-plus years ago now, the Bush administration made different arguments and justifications for intervention that seemed to shift like the sand of the Middle East.   Was it that Saddam Hussein was funding the kinds of terrorists who were responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks? Was it getting rid of a dictator who didn't align with American values? Was it creating a democracy that could be a model for the rest of the Middle East to follow? Or was it that he had weapons of mass destruction that he couldn't be allowed to keep before they resulted in a \"mushroom cloud,\" as then-President George W. Bush warned in 2002?   \n   In the case of Maduro, is it regime change because of a dictator who again doesn't align with American values, combating drug trafficking, leveraging oil or some version of all of the above? Each of those has had their moments as the justification for the Trump administration's saber-rattling.   During Saturday's news conference, Trump stressed oil as a key motivator. He said American oil companies would be going in and modernizing the country's oil production and refinement capabilities. He said the companies would invest billions and \"use that money in Venezuela.\" He said that the \"biggest beneficiary are going to be the people of Venezuela\" and Venezuelan ex-pats in the U.S. It's unclear how that would be managed.   \n   Trump has a long history of saying the United States should \"take the oil.\"   \"You're not stealing anything,\" Trump said of taking oil from Iraq in a 2011 interview with ABC. \"We're reimbursing ourselves.\"   Fast-forward to 2023, when Trump was out of office, talking about Venezuela.   \"We're buying oil from Venezuela,\" Trump said during an event in North Carolina. \"When I left, Venezuela was ready to collapse. We would have taken it over. We would have gotten all that oil. It would have been right next door. But now we're buying oil from Venezuela, so we're making a dictator very rich. Can you believe this? Nobody can believe it.\"   On Sunday, the administration was out in full force defending its actions, pinning the reasoning on drugs, primarily. The White House has repeatedly claimed to be stemming the flow of fentanyl by striking alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, despite the fact that fentanyl isn't largely produced in Venezuela.   Vice President Vance, who has been a vocal critic of U.S. intervention abroad in other cases, took on that critique on social media.   \n   \"[C]ocaine, which is the main drug trafficked out of Venezuela, is a profit center for all of the Latin America cartels,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"If you cut out the money from cocaine (or even reduce it) you substantially weaken the cartels overall. Also, cocaine is bad too!\"   He noted that \"a lot of fentanyl is coming out of Mexico,\" a reason that Trump \"shut down the border.\" That raises questions about what's next, too.   \n   Vance also referenced the oil: \"I understand the anxiety over the use of military force, but are we just supposed to allow a communist to steal our stuff in our hemisphere and do nothing?\"   Rubio, meanwhile, said that this was a law enforcement action to recover fugitives, because of a 2020 indictment of Maduro for the trafficking of cocaine. That, by the way, seems to be part of the administration's rationale for not seeking authorization from Congress.   These explanations are likely more politically palatable to the MAGA base than saying the United States is at war with Venezuela or, as Trump said, that the United States is now running another country — with no clear goals for an exit.   3. Speaking of Rubio, this action certainly seems to point to his increased influence with Trump.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump, CIA Director John Ratcliffe (left) and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (right) monitor U.S. military operations in Venezuela, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club on Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla.\n                \n                    Molly Riley/The White House via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Molly Riley/The White House via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, has always been more hawkish than Trump on foreign policy, particularly when it comes to Latin America.   During this Venezuela operation, Trump seems to be leaning on Rubio. Rubio was a central figure in the administration's announcement on Saturday and did the rounds on the Sunday shows to defend the action.   \n   In this second term, Rubio has taken on quite a few roles. After the hollowing out of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, Trump made him director of that program, as well as acting archivist of the National Archives, he's Trump's acting national security adviser and the secretary of state, which is also fourth in line to the presidency.   It's all evidence of how far Rubio has come to be able to burrow into Trump's inner circle. That's quite the turnabout from the bitter campaign a decade ago when Rubio was likening Trump to \"third world strongmen\" and a \"con artist\" with \"small hands,\" while Trump was dismissing him as \"Little Marco.\"   \n   4. Right-wing authoritarians are OK, but left-wing dictators are not?   Trump referred to Maduro as a \"dictator\" four times during his news conference Saturday (an \"outlaw dictator,\" \"illegitimate dictator,\" \"now-deposed dictator\" and \"dictator and terrorist\").   But there are lots of other dictators, authoritarians and strongmen in the rest of the world, many of whom Trump has praised through the years.   \n   Trump has allied himself with people like Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Argentina's Javier Milei, rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, seems deferential to Russia's Vladimir Putin, and, during his first term, made overtures to North Korea's Kim Jong Un.   Couldn't there be justifications for those leaders' overthrow, too, that an American administration could come up with, following Trump's logic?   It's not a far leap to suggest the difference is politics (and oil).   5. Don't expect MAGA to abandon Trump.    Yes, there's undoubtedly an irony in Trump campaigning against intervention and what he's done in Venezuela. There will be — and already are — voices of opposition in Trump's base.   But dedication to Trump among the faithful runs deep — and there's an entire conservative media infrastructure built to insulate him and give the base talking points.   It started in the early moments Saturday morning after the raid. On Fox News, for example, panelists were pointing to Democrats' arguments of the move being illegal as something to mock and knock down. They focused instead on how few in Venezuela were defending Maduro and on the 2020 indictment against him. One network legal analyst said essentially that Trump's action shows that the long arm of American justice doesn't end at U.S. borders.   Given the hyper-partisan ways in which Americans take in their news, don't expect any sort of a wholesale abandonment of Trump. It's more likely to become a rallying point.    \n   Republicans were already tilting toward action in Venezuela before what happened this weekend. A Quinnipiac University poll from December found, overall, that 63% of people said they were against military action in Venezuela. That included 68% of independents. But 52% of Republicans were in favor.   Plus, remember, this is a group of voters that has a lot of practice with being in favor of a tough, hawkish approach to foreign policy. (See: war, Iraq.) The Republican Party, for decades, was held together by a three-legged stool of fiscal conservatism, cultural conservatism and a hawkish foreign policy.   \n   Trump's approach to economics and foreign policy bucked that tradition and seemed to saw off two of those legs, making for some uncomfortable compromises for the GOP, while culture was the main thing gluing together the MAGA coalition.   So, going back to a hawkish foreign policy seems not that far removed from what the Republican Party has been.   6. Democrats have to be careful with their messaging.   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries disputed Rubio's insistence that the U.S. actions were \"not an invasion\" on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.   \"This was not simply a counter-narcotics operation,\" Jeffries said. \"It was an act of war. It involved, of course, the Delta Force. ... We have to make sure when we return to Washington, D.C., [after the holiday recess] that legislative action is taken to ensure that no further military steps occur absent explicit congressional approval.\"   But solely focusing on the legality of the move could be a political pitfall for Democrats. Trump and Republicans are very good at trying to put Democrats in a position of seemingly defending drug dealers and bad people.   Remember, the reason Democrats did well electorally in 2025 is because of the economy, specifically the cost of living. If they do well in 2026, it will likely again be because of that — not whether Trump's incursion into Venezuela was legal or violated international norms, as crassly political as that sounds.   \n   Still, Democrats can't ignore Venezuela and solely focus on affordability, either. They might point out the apparent hypocrisy of ousting Maduro because of drugs while pardoning the former head of Honduras, who was convicted of drug trafficking.   They could also pivot to how this is a distraction from the fact that many people are struggling to buy groceries, homes and health care.   It's about \"surfacing Republican priorities,\" said one Democratic strategist, who asked to remain anonymous because of their role with an outside group.   \n   \"They're more focused on making warfare than fixing health care,\" the strategist said.   7. The real test of the politics of this will be with what comes next.   Americans, including Trump and Vance, have been skeptical of U.S. foreign intervention not because the U.S. military can't pull off regime changes but because of what happens on Day 2 and beyond.   Trump was asked Saturday about the United States' \"mixed track record of ousting dictators without necessarily a plan for what comes afterwards.\"   The president gave a nonspecific and incongruous answer.   \n   \"Well, that's why we have different presidents, but with me, that's not true,\" he said. \"With me, we've had a perfect track record of winning.\"   He went on to cite his administration's 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, the former leader of Iran's Quds Force, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former ISIS leader. Neither of them was a head of state. He also talked about the U.S. bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities last year.   But Trump did not lay out the plan for what comes next for Venezuela or his foreign policy.   This is the president's most vulnerable point politically in this second term. He is facing his worst approval ratings, is going to be 80 in June and is inching closer to politically irrelevant lame-duck status.   So it might not be surprising that Trump would try to stay in the headlines, like with this Venezuela action, and shift attention away from other, more negative issues for him politically.\n",

In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.   Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"   \n   \"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.   Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.   Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.   \"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.   \n   Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.   Michel obtained over $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho — also known as Jho Low — and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.   Michel also tried to end a Justice Department investigation of Low, tampered with two witnesses and perjured himself at trial, prosecutors said.   \n   Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.   \"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.   In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative AI program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.\n",

You can refuse illegal orders.MARTÍNEZ: The White House later walked back Trump's comments. In a few minutes, we speak with one of the lawmakers in the video, Representative Jason Crow. First, NPR's Quil Lawrence happened to be interviewing dozens of veterans who were on Capitol Hill this week to talk about this same subject.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Forty-one vets from 21 states visited Washington this week to express concern that National Guard and even active-duty troops have been dragged into domestic law enforcement. Jackie Robinson (ph) is a 27-year veteran of the Army.JACKIE ROBINSON: I want to speak out against the politicalization of the military and to protect the Constitution.LAWRENCE: Robinson also worked in law enforcement. She says the military has a different mission, and mixing the two is dangerous for troops and civilians.ROBINSON: And the lines are being blurred when you just put someone into a position that they're not trained for.ALEX MCCOY: I served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, commanders in chief.LAWRENCE: Alex McCoy is a former Marine.MCCOY: So this is not a partisan issue. This is not a political issue. It's just a matter of protecting our military from getting sucked into divisive internal politics and avoiding situations where American citizens are afraid of men and women in uniform.LAWRENCE: While these vets met with figures from both parties, six Democratic lawmakers put out a video.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLY: You can refuse illegal orders.ELISSA SLOTKIN: You can refuse illegal orders.CHRIS DELUZIO: You must refuse illegal orders.SLOTKIN: No one has to carry out orders that violate the law.CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Or our Constitution.LAWRENCE: On social media, President Trump called for the six Democrats to be tried for treason. He reposted a suggestion to hang them. White House adviser Stephen Miller spoke on Fox News.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN MILLER: It's a general call for rebellion from the CIA and the Armed Services of the United States by Democrat lawmakers.LAWRENCE: The White House later put out a statement that the president does not want to execute members of Congress. The military swear an oath to the Constitution and are trained that following orders is not a defense for illegal acts. At the moment, there is a debate and lawsuits about whether deploying troops domestically or lethal strikes against alleged drug boats break US or international law.Quil Lawrence, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The problem is, no one knows what might be coming.   Steve Simon, the Democratic secretary of state of Minnesota, likened it to planning for natural disasters.   \"You have to use your imagination to consider and plan for the most extreme scenario,\" Simon said.   Carly Koppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County in Colorado, said officials in her state are shoring up their relationships with local law enforcement and county and state attorney's offices, to make sure any effort to interfere with voting is \"met with a pretty good force of resistance.\"   \n   \"We have to plan for the worst and hope we get the best,\" Koppes said. \"I think we're all kind of conditioned at this point to expect anything and everything, and our bingo cards keep getting bigger and bigger with things that we would have never have had on them.\"   \n   Trump, who continues to spread false claims about voting in America, issued an executive order in the spring that sought to mandate major changes to the elections system. That order has so far mostly been blocked by the courts, but he's teased other executive action as well. And his administration is still investigating his loss five years ago, while pardoning people associated with his efforts to try to overturn that defeat.   All of that has made it clear to those in the elections community that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a few things voting officials are watching for.   More executive action to take control of voting   The Constitution is clear: States control their own election processes, with Congress able to set guidelines for federal races. The president has virtually no authority when it comes to voting.   But Trump is testing that, and those in his circle have pushed fringe theories for how he can change how ballots are cast and counted.   \n   Earlier this month, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House is working on a new executive order that will seemingly target mail voting. Trump also said earlier this year that he wanted to ban some voting machines, though it's unclear exactly what he was referring to.   \n   Election officials agree he does not have the legal authority to do either of those things. But recently, Trump ally and attorney Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump in 2020, broached a bolder strategy to enact election changes: declaring a national emergency.   \"The president's authority is limited in his role with regard to elections except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States — as I think that we can establish with the porous system that we have,\" Mitchell said on a podcast appearance in September.   It would be keeping with one of Trump's broader policy strategies: This year he's invoked presidential emergency powers more frequently than any other modern president.   Election experts say there's no legal basis for Mitchell's theory, but numerous voting officials told NPR it's something that's come up in conversations about next year.   U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who previously oversaw voting in California as secretary of state, also brought up the scenario recently on the Senate floor.   \"If the Trump White House tried to declare some fake national emergency to create a pretense for federal intervention, I will force a vote here in the Senate to stop it,\" Padilla said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi listens as President Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House on Oct. 15.\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Troops on the ground   Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, says six months ago he wouldn't have taken the premise of federal troops at polling places seriously.   But seeing how the National Guard was deployed — and justified — this summer changed his thinking.   \"You have National Guard deploying to cities to supposedly quell these 'demonstrations' — basically people in frog suits and riding their bikes naked is the biggest threat,\" Hobbs said. \"And yeah, I start thinking that maybe it could be possible.\"   \n   Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump spoke of a desire to have federal law enforcement patrol voting locations, and this year, his former adviser Steve Bannon said on his War Room podcast that he hopes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are patrolling polling places in the midterms.   Legal experts say such intervention is clearly illegal, but until the federal government disavows such actions clearly, Simon said voting officials have to game out how to respond.   \"One thing that would help is if someone at the federal government would come out and categorically say, 'No, no, no, stop the presses, stop everything. You'll never have to worry about that. That's not something we would ever consider doing,'\" Simon said. \"That would go a long way.\"   \n   In response to questions about forces outside polling places, and other scenarios mentioned in this story, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson characterized them as \"baseless conspiracy theories and Democrat talking points\" but did not directly answer whether the White House would commit not to send agents to voting locations. She reiterated that the president is permitted to send federal personnel to localities to help quell violent crime.   Who is a trusted source?   For the last decade, as voting officials have fought to dam up a tsunami of false information about their work, they've begged people in their communities to go to \"trusted sources\" for election information.   In 2026, figuring out who is a trusted source may be more difficult than ever.   Along with Trump himself, his administration has elevated to prominent government roles numerous people who have a history of spreading false information about elections, and local officials worry their message may be drowned out by those with much bigger megaphones.   One of the hires alarming voting officials interviewed by NPR works at the Department of Homeland Security. Heather Honey, who's now deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity, worked alongside Mitchell for the past few years to help spread election conspiracy theories, including one about votes in Pennsylvania that Trump mentioned in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a mob stormed the Capitol.   \n   \"I equate this to having a moon landing conspiracy theorist and flat earther being offered a job at NASA,\" Hobbs said.   DHS did not respond to NPR's request for comment.   Numerous officials at the Department of Justice also have a history of election denial.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A poll worker holds \"I Voted\" stickers as people cast ballots on Nov. 4 in  the Brooklyn borough of New York City.\n                \n                    Michael M.

Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Unprecedented demands   The insistence to relitigate 2020 also has voting officials worried about what sort of actions administration officials plan to take. Already this year, DOJ has made unprecedented requests to investigate voting machines, access old ballots, and accumulate mass amounts of voter data.   This summer, a consultant in Colorado contacted Koppes and other clerks in that state, in some cases saying he was associated with the White House and asking about accessing their voting machines.   The White House denied to CNN and other outlets authorizing the requests, but separately, in Missouri, a Department of Justice official reached out to clerks there asking basically the same thing.   In each instance, they were told no.   \"Since 2020, people in the elections world have become even more knowledgeable of the responsibilities of the different levels of government [when it comes to voting equipment],\" Koppes said.   A similar push and pull is playing out with elections data. The Trump administration has quickly built what is essentially a searchable national citizenship database, and is trying to entice states to run their voting records through it to root out noncitizens on voter rolls. While many Republican election officials have eagerly embraced the system, other GOP officials and their Democratic counterparts have been hesitant to engage with the tool, as there are questions about how well it works, what happens to the voting data once it's been run through the system and, in many states, whether even using the tool is legal under state law.   Still, the administration is intent to investigate voter rolls as it continues to push false narratives about widespread noncitizen voting. The DOJ recently sued eight states (all states Trump lost in 2020) in an effort to compel them to turn over their rolls.   \n   \"It's really not a red state or blue state thing,\" said Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of state of Pennsylvania, in an interview with PBS News Hour about the data demands. \"It is a — in my view, a concerning attempt, a concerning effort to consolidate and overreach at the federal level. In the United States of America, it's the states who run elections, not the federal government.\"   Vulnerable targets   Since Trump took office, the federal government has pulled back on virtually all of its work related to cybersecurity and elections. The Department of Homeland Security laid off employees focused on election security, and stopped funding a partnership that helped local elections offices share threat information.   Wesley Wilcox, a Republican election supervisor in Marion County, Fla., said smaller counties especially will be more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the cuts, and Russia, China or any other U.S. adversary may see an opportunity.   \"That's what I would do,\" Wilcox said. \"I mean, if I were on that side of the fence, I'm like, 'OK, they're cutting this stuff out. Let's go get them.' You know, 'cause the defenses are down.\"   Secretary Hobbs, of Washington, told NPR that two years ago he was notified by DHS about a hack in one of his counties. The state responded immediately to make sure the breach wouldn't impact the voter registration database.   Now, Hobbs said, \"I don't even know if I would have gotten that phone call, to tell you the truth.\"   In Arizona, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said he didn't even contact DHS' cyber agency after an online candidate portal was hacked this summer because he didn't have confidence in the agency's \"capacity to collaborate in good faith or to prioritize national security over political theater.\"\n",

But there's no question that there's a lot of surprise and shock,\" said Russell Galbutt, one of Miami Beach's biggest developers.    Galbutt's ad campaign builds on messaging from Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner on social media, which was directed at city residents unhappy with the election results.   \"We're just highlighting, 'Hey, if you're looking for a law and order city with sunshine, with no state income tax, there's a lot of positives for why you should be here,'\" Meiner told NPR. \"The mayor-elect is a self-described socialist and I think there's a concern about the freedom of businesses to act as capitalist businesses need to. But there's also a concern by Jewish residents and businesses.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner says the city's beaches, sunshine and no state income tax should be a lure for New Yorkers ready to leave the city.\n                \n                    Greg Allen/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Greg Allen/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Mamdani alarmed some Jewish voters because of his support for Palestinian rights and critical views of Israel. Exit polls showed Mamdani received about a third of the Jewish vote in this month's election. His office did not return a request for comment on the billboard campaign.   \n   Galbutt decided to fund an ad campaign out of frustration over what he views as economic stagnation at one of Florida's most popular resort destinations. After years of violence during spring break, which included some shootings, Miami Beach adopted tough measures two years ago that have been effective. But a decline in sales tax revenue and business closures since then show something else is needed, the developer said.    \"Miami Beach went into an entire campaign to tell people that we didn't want spring breakers in Miami Beach any longer,\" Galbutt said. \"But we never spent five cents or $5 on a campaign saying who we do want.\"    Meiner is more upbeat about the business climate in Miami Beach,  pointing to a $30 million revitalization project underway to boost its Lincoln Road business district.    \"We have Lamborghini ... opening up a showroom in Miami Beach. A Swiss watchmaker is coming here,\" he said. \"There's a lot of investment coming here. And we're just highlighting for people who maybe hadn't thought of Miami Beach, that they should be.\"   Meiner said he's received mostly positive comments from residents about his push to attract more New Yorkers to Miami Beach. But he acknowledged he did get some pushback on social media.    \n   \"The negatives,\" he said, \"were really directed like, 'Why are you trying to bring more residents here? We already have a lot of traffic.'\"    \n   Among Miami Beach residents, an informal survey found mostly support for a campaign to bring more New Yorkers to the city. Asked if Miami Beach needs more New Yorkers, retiree Neil Kahanovitz said, \"Well, having come from New York, I wouldn't mind a few more.\"   Kahanovitz came to Miami Beach because he got tired of \"the cold, the crowds, the crime and the high taxes.\" As for whether the election of a Democratic Socialist mayor would encourage more people to leave the city? \"It's certainly not going to encourage them to stay,\" he said.   Michael Sprotzer, another Miami Beach resident, is skeptical that a wave of New Yorkers and their businesses will soon be heading south. Sprotzer, who works in real estate, noted some of the investment firms who during COVID moved their offices to South Florida, have since moved back to New York.   \"I think maybe some people who are thinking about coming to South Florida, it will be a good impetus for them to do so,\" he said. \"But I don't think people who love New York are all of a sudden going to move down here.\"       \n",

The White House sit-down on Friday marked a stark contrast for the two leaders. Trump has repeatedly sought to paint Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, as too extreme for the city that he long called home. In the president's announcement of the meeting on Truth Social earlier this week, Trump called Mamdani a \"communist.\"   However, speaking to reporters after the meeting in the Oval Office, that antipathy was nowhere to be found. Trump praised Mamdani's campaign and pledged to work with him on shared policy concerns centered on the cost of living and reducing crime.   \n   \"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see – really wants to see – New York be great again,\" said Trump, who was born in Queens, N.Y., the same borough that Mamdani partially represented in the State Assembly. \"I'll be cheering for him.\"   Mamdani had previously called Trump a \"despot,\" but standing to his side on Friday he echoed the president's interest in cooperating around shared goals.   \"I enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to working together to deliver that affordability for New Yorkers,\" he said.   Over the course of just months, Mamdani's candidacy for mayor turned from a long-shot bid to a national movement, sparking interest far beyond New York in his progressive ideas, including freezing rent in rent-stabilized units, making city buses free and opening city-run grocery stores.   It's a platform that quickly caught the ire of many conservative leaders, notably Trump, who made no secret of his opposition to Mamdani following his upset win in June's Democratic primary.   In the lead-up to Election Day, Trump said he would arrest Mamdani if he disrupted ICE operations in the city, and falsely suggested that Mamdani — a naturalized citizen — was living in the country illegally. At one point, he threatened to pull the city's federal funding were Mamdani to win. He also endorsed Mamdani's rival in the race, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.   \n   But over the course of his public appearance with Mamdani, Trump told reporters he was surprised by several broad areas of agreement.    \"He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down, all things that I agree with,\" Trump said, while acknowledging that the two leaders \"may disagree how we get there.\"   While it's unclear if the meeting will lead to a lasting working relationship, Friday's meeting seemed to signal at least a temporary break from the past rhetoric that defined their relationship.    Trump rose to Mamdani's defense on multiple occasions while speaking to reporters, declining to agree with conservative attacks calling Mamdani a \"jihadist,\" and saying he would feel comfortable living in New York City under a Mamdani administration.   \"We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,\" Trump explained. \"I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job.\"   The president also made light of Mamdani's past comments, where he referred to the president as a \"fascist.\" When reporters asked Mamdani to confirm, Trump interrupted and brushed off the label, telling the incoming mayor, \"That's okay. You can just say yes.\"   \"It's easier than explaining it,\" Trump added. \"I don't mind.\"\n",

The Trump administration is snubbing the event over false race-based claims and what it considers the summit's DEI – diversity, equity and inclusion -- agenda. Since returning to office Trump has accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners.   \"You know we have a G20 meeting in South Africa, South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore, because what happened there is bad,\" Trump said earlier this month.   \n   The government here has repeatedly tried to correct the U.S. administration, to no avail.   \n   Ramaphosa has kept his cool and was taciturn this week, saying: \"Their absence is their loss.\"   Still, it's a huge blow to South Africa on the global stage.   President Javier Milei of Argentina announced he isn't coming in solidarity with Trump.   The leader of the world's second biggest economy, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is also not attending – though not as a slight – he isn't travelling internationally much these days. Then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin who can't come as he'd face arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine.   William Gumede, an associate professor at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, says the summit controversy is a sign of the times.   \"It is symbolic of the fractured global moment that we are in… it's almost an alternative summit without China and without America,\" Gumede told NPR.   The summit's themes of \"solidarity, equality, sustainability\" are anathema to the U.S. administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying South Africa is pushing a quote \"DEI and climate change\" agenda.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, center left and a South African official watch the Fire and Ivory Pantsula dance group perform upon his arrival at the OR Tambo International airport in Ekurhuleni on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025 ahead of the G20 leaders' Summit.\n                \n                    MARCO LONGARI/Pool AFP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        MARCO LONGARI/Pool AFP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   However other countries whose leaders are attending, like Germany, have praised the theme.   U.S. Spat deepens   As foreign leaders like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer started to arrive in South Africa on Friday, the  U.S.-South Africa spat deepened after Ramaphosa said the U.S. had made an eleventh-hour request to send a delegation after all.   \n   \"We have received notice from the United States…about a change of mind about participating in one shape, form or another in the Summit,\" he said. \"We still need to engage with them fully on what their participation at the 11th hour means.\"   However, the South African leader said \"the United States being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be there, so it is pleasing there is a change of approach.\"   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back angrily.   \"The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa, I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States and that language is not appreciated,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, left, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the end of their media conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025.\n                \n                    Themba Hadebe/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Themba Hadebe/AP\n    \n\n   \n   She said because the U.S. is taking over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa, the embassy's chargé d'affaires—seen as a junior official -- would be there for the symbolic hand over.   However Ramaphosa's spokesman said on X, quote \"The president won't hand over to a chargé.\"   One of the big questions is whether the end of the summit on Sunday will result in a joint declaration by the countries in attendance – which the  U.S. is unlikely to sign.   Tensions at home   Aside from the geopolitical wrangling over the event, there has been discontent surrounding the summit from many in South Africa.   Johannesburg residents have complained the city is only getting a cleanup for foreign guests despite having had crumbling infrastructure and chronic electricity and water shortages for years.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Betereinders, a liberal Afrikaner organization, erected a billboard ahead of the G20 Summit showing South Africa's rugby team the Springboks. The quote is from President Trump.\n                \n                    The Betereinders\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        The Betereinders\n    \n\n   \n   \"Oh they are fixing, the traffic lights are up…the grass has been cut, all for? G20... You're showing off for visitors but you have no regard for the people that live in that city,\" journalist Redi Tlhabi said in her popular podcast.   \n   Ahead of the summit, on Friday, thousands of women dressed in black marked a day of action against gender-based violence, staying home from work and peacefully protesting by laying flat in parks and at university campuses.   \n   The group organizing the event, Women for Change, say they wanted to call attention to the high rates of femicide and violence in South Africa as the G20 convenes.   Then there's been the war of the billboards.   Trump's reason for snubbing South Africa has put race relations here in the spotlight and Afrikaners have differed in their responses.   One right-wing Afrikaans rights group, which agrees with Trump that whites are being persecuted, has put up large billboards welcoming G20 delegates to \"the most race-regulated country in the world\" – a reference to affirmative action laws.   In response, a progressive Afrikaner association has mounted their own campaign, with billboards showing the country's beloved rugby team, the Springboks. In the photo, two smiling white Afrikaner players carry their Black captain Siya Kolisi on their shoulders.   \"Terrible things are happening in South Africa,\" reads the tongue-in-cheek tagline on the billboard.\n",

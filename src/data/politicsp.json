The first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. began strikes in September marks a significant escalation in the administration's months-long pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government. The strike has not been acknowledged by Venezuelan officials.   President Donald Trump first made reference to the operation in an interview Friday with John Catsimatidis on WABC radio in New York, saying the U.S. had knocked out some type of \"big facility where ships come from.\"   \n   In an exchange with reporters Monday as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump added that the operation targeted a \" dock area where they load the boats up with drugs.\" But the president declined to comment when asked whether the attack was conducted by the military or the CIA.   The CIA and White House officials also declined to offer further comment on the matter. Col. Allie Weiskopf, a spokesperson for Special Operations Command, which oversees U.S operations in the Caribbean, said in a statement that \"Special Operations did not support this operation to include intel support.\"   The strike escalates what began as a massive buildup of U.S. personnel in the Caribbean Sea starting in August, which has been followed by at least 30 U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. More recently, Trump has ordered a quasi-blockade aimed at seizing sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of Venezuela.   CNN first reported on the CIA's involvement in the operation.   Trump for months had threatened that he could soon order strikes on targets on Venezuelan land. He's also taken the unusual step of publicly acknowledging that he had authorized the CIA to carry out covert action inside Venezuela.   \n   The administration is required to report covert CIA actions to senior congressional officials, including the chair and ranking members of both the Senate and House intelligence committees. But Trump, by entrusting what appears to be the first land strike of the Venezuelan campaign to the intelligence agency, could be calculating that the action would face less scrutiny from lawmakers than a military strike.   \"I authorized for two reasons, really. No. 1, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America,\" he said in October as he confirmed to reporters his approval for the CIA to act. \"And the other thing, the drugs, we have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea.\"   All the while, Trump has repeatedly said Maduro's days in power are numbered. The Venezuelan leader and members of his inner circle have been under federal indictment in the United States since 2020 for narcoterrorism and other charges.   Maduro has denied the charges. The U.S. Justice Department this year doubled to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest.   The Venezuelan president made no mention of the CIA operation during an hourlong speech Tuesday at an international leadership school for women.   —   AP writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed reporting.\n",

Tim Walz pushed back on X, saying fraudsters are a serious issue that the state has spent years cracking down on but that this move is part of \"Trump's long game.\"   \"He's politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans,\" Walz said.   \n   O'Neill referenced a right-wing influencer who posted a video Friday claiming he found that day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis had committed up to $100 million in fraud. O'Neill said he has demanded Walz submit an audit of these centers that includes attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections.   \"We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud,\" O'Neill said.   The announcement comes one day after U.S. Homeland Security officials were in Minneapolis conducting a fraud investigation by going to unidentified businesses and questioning workers.   There have been years of investigations that included a $300 million pandemic food fraud scheme revolving around the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, for which 57 defendants in Minnesota have been convicted. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest COVID-19-related fraud scam, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program meant to provide food for children.   A federal prosecutor alleged earlier this month that half or more of the roughly $18 billion in federal funds that supported 14 programs in Minnesota since 2018 may have been stolen. Most of the defendants in the child nutrition, housing services and autism program schemes are Somali Americans, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Minnesota.   \n   O'Neill, who is serving as acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also said in the social media post Tuesday that payments across the U.S. through the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, will now require \"justification and a receipt or photo evidence\" before money is sent. They have also launched a fraud-reporting hotline and email address.   The Administration for Children and Families provides $185 million in child care funds annually to Minnesota, according to Assistant Secretary Alex Adams.   \n   \"That money should be helping 19,000 American children, including toddlers and infants,\" he said in a video posted on X. \"Any dollar stolen by fraudsters is stolen from those children.\"   Adams said he spoke Monday with the director of Minnesota's child care services office and she wasn't able to say \"with confidence whether those allegations of fraud are isolated or whether there's fraud stretching statewide.\"   Trump has criticized Walz's administration over the fraud cases, capitalizing on them to target the Somalia diaspora in the state, which has the largest Somali population in the U.S.   \n   Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, has said an audit due by late January should give a better picture of the extent of the fraud. He said his administration is taking aggressive action to prevent additional fraud. He has long defended how his administration responded.   Minnesota's most prominent Somali American, Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, has urged people not to blame an entire community for the actions of a relative few.\n",

Many experts credit Biden-era public health policies with saving tens of thousands of lives. But with new laws, executive orders, budget cuts, and military redeployments, Trump pivoted the nation from those strategies to a militarized drug war.     \"From day one of the Trump administration we declared an all-out war on the dealers, smugglers, traffickers and cartels,\" Trump said in July, during a signing ceremony for the Halt Fentanyl Act.      \n   Trump has launched U.S. Naval strikes against alleged drug boats; designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations; classified fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction; and deployed National Guard troops in American cities and along the U.S.-Mexico border.   Meanwhile, his administration threw into question support for even basic federally funded addiction treatment programs, at one point temporarily freezing $140 million in federal grants as front-line care providers scrambled to maintain services.   Scrapping the public health approach    Trump's rapid realignment of U.S. drug policy stems in part from his assertion that Biden's effort to reduce fentanyl deaths was a wholesale failure.  Speaking this month, Trump made the false claim that \"three hundred million people died last year from drugs.\"     Fentanyl deaths did surge in the first two years of the Biden administration, during the COVID pandemic.  But fatal overdoses declined sharply in 2023 and 2024, as the Biden team raced to expand access to opioid-treatment medications, including buprenorphine and naloxone.     The Biden administration also boosted federal spending by tens of billions of dollars on addiction treatment, while embracing a \"harm reduction\" approach, providing Medicaid health insurance, housing and other services to people even if they weren't yet able or willing to stop using street drugs.     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In 2023, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden spoke during a meeting about countering the flow of fentanyl into the United States. The session followed meetings with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where Biden announced that he and Xi reached an understanding about reducing the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China to the U.S.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   According to provisional data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fatal overdoses in the U.S. plunged nearly 27 percent during Biden's last year in office.    \n   \"We've made gains.  There are more people now being treated for substance use disorders and opioid use disorders,\" said Richard Frank, a drug policy researcher at the Brookings Institution. \"That is largely due to the Medicaid (insurance) expansion.\"   But after returning to the White House, the Trump administration, working with GOP leaders in Congress, moved swiftly to strip roughly $1 trillion from Medicaid funding, including cuts to programs that support addiction care.  In a July executive order, Trump also attacked harm reduction efforts, claiming without evidence that they \"only facilitate illegal drug use.\"   The shift alarms many researchers, physicians, and drug policy analysts, who fear a resurgence of drug deaths.     \"The biggest risk really of increasing overdose deaths is the Medicaid cutbacks,\" said Regina LaBelle, who briefly served as acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under Biden and now teaches drug policy at Georgetown University.  \"It's not just about defunding harm reduction. They're also defunding prevention, treatment and recovery programs.\"   Fentanyl, a \"weapon of mass destruction\"   There's also growing evidence that Biden-era law enforcement and diplomatic efforts managed to disrupt the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., in part by convincing China to help reduce the sale of industrial \"precursor\" chemicals used to make street fentanyl.    \"The important (Biden team) success was the cooperation with China that built up during 2024,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, who studies drug cartels and street drug trafficking at the Brookings Institution.  \"This included law enforcement cooperation and intelligence exchange and cooperation on anti-money laundering efforts.\"   Over the last 12 months, however, Trump and his team discounted the Biden team's efforts.  Speaking in July, Trump suggested the deadly fentanyl crisis was \"allowed to happen by people either that didn't care or were stupid people.\" He has also suggested that carnage from overdoses was so great it justified a militarized response.   \n   \"Two to three hundred thousand people die every year, that we know of, so we're formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction,\" Trump said in December, citing a statistic contradicted by federal data.   Research by the CDC, the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration, and other top U.S. drug researchers shows that drug deaths peaked in 2023 at roughly 115,000 deaths in a single 12-month period.  The latest provisional CDC data shows roughly 76,500 fatal overdoses in the 12-month period ending in April 2025.    Indeed, many of Trump's new drug policy initiatives are based on claims that drug policy researchers describe as wildly inflated or wholly inaccurate.  One of his first major fentanyl-related actions was an executive order signed in February imposing steep tariffs on Canadian products, because of what Trump described as Canada's \"central role\" in fentanyl smuggling.    \n   But data from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration shows Canada plays almost no role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis.  In 2024, roughly 43 pounds of fentanyl was seized at America's northern border. That compares with roughly 21,100 pounds seized at the southern border.   Top administration officials have also made exaggerated claims about progress made to reduce drug deaths during Trump's first year back in office.     During a cabinet meeting, Attorney General Pam Bondi said aggressive anti-drug policies had already saved 258 million American lives. In a separate post on social media, Bondi estimated the lives saved at a much lower figure, claiming roughly 119 million lives saved. Researchers who study the potential harm of fentanyl and other street drugs told NPR both claims are greatly inflated.   \n            Today is Fentanyl Awareness day. In President Trump’s first 100 days we’ve seized over 22 million fentanyl laced pills, saving over 119 Million lives.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, has said Trump's military strikes near Venezuela are already having a deterrent effect on drug cartels.    \"There aren't many people getting in boats right now running drugs, which is the whole point.  We want to stop the poisoning of the American people,\" Hegseth said, during an appearance hosted by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.   The Trump administration has declined to offer evidence that boats targeted by the Navy are operated by cartel-linked smugglers.  Researchers who study drug traffickers, including Felbab-Brown at Brookings, say even if some boats are carrying street drugs, they almost certainly aren't carrying fentanyl, the drug that accounts for most U.S. overdose deaths.      \n   The latest U.S. National Drug Threat Assessment, published by the DEA in July 2025, says drug gangs in Mexico, not Venezuela, \"remain the dominant threats\" trafficking fentanyl into American communities.   Drug gangs, motivated by the lure of huge profits, have also developed flexible underground supply routes, which may be largely unaffected by military strikes that kill low-level gang members.     Critics of the Trump administration's approach told NPR the deterrent effect of a militarized U.S. drug war will also be hampered by Trump's decision over the last year to pardon or free a growing number of drug \"kingpin\" figures.    Since returning to office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who was serving a life sentence after creating Silk Road, an internet site used to traffic fentanyl and other street drugs; pardoned Larry Hoover, former leader of the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples; and pardoned the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, convicted on drug and weapons charges after governing his country as \"a narco-state,\" according to a statement from the U.S. Justice Department.   \n   \"There's a lot of mixed messages and mixed signals [from the White House] which creates sort of chaos and uncertainty,\" said Jeffrey Singer, a drug policy analyst at the Cato Institute, in an interview with NPR in May. \"On the one hand you're threatening even tougher penalties on people who deal in drugs, while on the other hand you're releasing drug dealers from prisons.\"\n",

By tradition, this is a formal introduction, the chance for a new congressperson to announce what he stands for.   Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, told the story of his father's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease just a few weeks prior. After the appointment, Kim said he sat in his car in shock, replaying the words of the doctor who warned him that his next year was going to be hell.   Kim said the costs of care have already been \"catastrophic\" for his family. \"Why is it so hard to provide care in this country?\" he asked. \"Why is providing care so insanely complicated?\"   \n   The takeaway: Family caregiving is so difficult that even a U.S. senator is overwhelmed.   And even a senator doesn't know how to fix it.   There's consensus that something needs to change. Kim chose to focus this high-profile speech on family caregiving because it resonates: An estimated 63 million Americans currently care for elderly or chronically ill adults, according to a survey from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving.    \n   And 79% of Republicans and 89% of Democrats agree that the government needs to do more to help people caring for their family members. In 2024, both presidential candidates promised to do something about it.   Since then, though, nothing much has happened at the national level. But a shift is underway, say policy-watchers and advocates for caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic made family caregiving more visible and changed its image. Since then, care is increasingly perceived as a labor and economic issue — a social concern rather than just a family problem.    A broad coalition called Care Can't Wait brings together labor, aging and disability interests. It is pushing to put family caregiving on the national agenda by lobbying policymakers, organizing events, and raising awareness.   In the last few years, state governments have begun implementing policies to help caregivers, such as tax breaks, an innovative public long-term care insurance program, and new job protections for working caregivers. State-level policy experiments like these often build momentum for national-level change, say policy experts.   \n   \"There's been huge momentum in the last five years that I have not seen in the last 20,\" says Alison Barkoff, professor of health law at George Washington University and former assistant secretary of aging at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"I feel optimism that this is setting the stage for something big.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Sen. Andy Kim.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Growing needs and a patchwork of support   The number of family caregivers for adults has already doubled since 2014. And older people are now the nation's fastest-growing age group.   Half of them will eventually need daily help with even simple tasks like cooking, getting dressed and keeping house. Some will need much more extensive care.   \n   That task will mostly fall to family and friends, because most people cannot afford to pay someone else to do it. Forty hours a week of paid caregiving help runs about $71,000 a year. The average annual nursing home bill is $110,000. Medicare covers almost none of it.   Family caregivers spend an average of $7,242 in out-of-pocket expenses every year, an AARP survey found in 2021. About a third dip into retirement savings or take on credit card debt to cover expenses like assisted living facility fees, home modifications, medical bills or adult day care.   \"The cost of long-term care is exponentially higher than things like childcare that get far more attention in national media,\" says Nicole Jorwic, chief program officer at Caring Across Generations, an advocacy group focused on care.   Currently, there's no nationwide system for family caregivers to find out what help might be available. Eligibility rules vary widely, and caregiving programs or assistance are administered by a profusion of entities, from state and local governments to the Veterans Administration and nonprofits. The programs do not connect with one another, so caregivers must research each separately.   And national policymakers have not acted to address the cash crunch or knit up the isolated sources of support into an actual safety net.   \n   The most consequential caregiving-related federal action in 2025 was to trim nearly $1 trillion from the Medicaid budget over the next 10 years, which experts predict will translate into cuts for some of the roughly 4.5 million family caregivers paid through the program. \"Even the patchwork that did exist is getting shredded,\" says Jorwic.   The states step in   The picture is more promising at the state level. Across the nation, lawmakers are trying out policies to defray costs or provide new forms of help. These experiments are rapidly spreading.   In 2023, Oklahoma and Nebraska were the first states to adopt tax credits for family caregivers. Since then, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, North Dakota and South Carolina have followed suit. Another dozen or so states are discussing similar bills, says Megan O'Reilly, vice president of health and family at AARP, which advocates for these laws. The credits reimburse family caregivers for expenses like home modifications or paid help, usually capped at around $2,000 to $3,000 a year.   Some states also subsidize respite care in the form of short-term paid caregiving or institutional care, so that family caregivers can take a few days off or deal with other obligations.   \n   About 60% of family caregivers also work; many states are modifying employment laws to help them manage both responsibilities. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires certain employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, covers less than half of all American employees.   In the last few years, 13 states and Washington, D.C., passed laws requiring employers to offer up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. Similar programs in Maine, Delaware and Minnesota are rolling out now. In these programs, payroll taxes cover the costs, much like unemployment insurance. In ten other states, including Texas and Virginia, paid leave is optional, and employers can add the benefit by buying commercial insurance.   \n   In other states, laws that permit caregivers to take paid or unpaid leave now include in-laws, domestic partners, or even close friends. Other states, counties and cities like Delaware, Florida's Monroe County, and Battle Creek, Michigan created rules to explicitly protect against workplace discrimination, so workers can't be fired or demoted because of their caregiving responsibilities.   The most ambitious state caregiver support program to date rolls out in the next few days. In 2023, Washington workers started paying into a fund for universal long-term care insurance. In 2026, qualified workers will be able to tap into this pool to pay for in-home care, home modifications, and even meals and transportation, up to a lifetime limit of $36,000. Seven other states are considering similar programs, including big ones like California and New York.   Altogether, one or more of these policies apply to the majority of the nation's caregivers, covering 25 states and 31 cities.   The care movement to come   These new laws add more patches to the patchwork. At the federal level, administrative tweaks to Medicaid rules in the last few years have also made it easier for certain caregivers to get training and help. But a truly comprehensive caregiver support system will require vision, big-ticket policies and big budgets, say the policy experts and advocates who monitor long-term care.   For example, in 2021, Reps. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and John Moolenaar, R-Mich., introduced a bill to create a national long-term care insurance program to cover catastrophic costs of care. Payments would kick in only after the family covers the bills for at least a year. The idea is not only to help families, but to reinvigorate the long-term care insurance market, which currently covers only about 5% of the cost of care nationwide. This bill is supported by the National Alliance for Caregiving, among others. It was reintroduced in 2025.   \n   The Care Can't Wait coalition's goals include a comprehensive paid family and medical leave law that would cover all working caregivers.   The coalition's biggest ticket item: Expanding Medicare to pay for long-term care, an idea that's been repeatedly proposed ever since the law was written in 1965. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign floated a modest version of this plan, with an estimated pricetag of $40 billion a year.   Ambitious national efforts like these might not currently be realistic, advocates concede. But the sheer number of struggling family caregivers and the value of their work — estimated at $600 billion a year in 2021 — will force change, especially as older and disabled populations continue to grow.   \"As a society, we are at a pivot point,\" says Jorwic. \"Economic forces are going to push solutions.\" The ultimate aim is to foster a new care movement — what Kim called for in his speech.   There are already subtle changes, says O'Reilly. When she and other AARP representatives meet with legislators, they no longer need to explain what family caregiving is and why it matters. Most often, someone on the staff has personal experience with it themselves.   \"People are connecting with the issue, and sharing their own stories,\" she says. \"That's a transformation from where we started this work.\"   Kat McGowan is a freelance writer in California focused on caregiving.\n",

Pictures; NEON; Eddy Chen/Lionsgate; Warner Bros. Pictures\n    \n\n   \n   In 2025, a time of intense political turmoil and division, James L. Brooks released his first film in 15 years, a political rom-dramedy looking back on the year 2008 through wistful, Obamacore-clouded eyes. Despite a stacked ensemble that includes Jamie Lee Curtis and Albert Brooks, Ella McCay is easily one of the worst movies of the year for many reasons, not least of which is a line in which a character proclaims 2008 as \"a better time, when we all still liked each other.\" (Obvious follow-up question: Who is \"we\"?) Even more glaring is the fact that its protagonist, played by Emma Mackey, becomes the de facto Anyparty governor of Anytown, USA — her political party is never identified, the state she lives and serves in is never named.   \n   The revisionist non-specificity demonstrates zero interest in meeting The Moment, though plenty of other films released this year have at least attempted to engage with it more directly. This isn't to say all of them pulled off their aims. But before seeing Ella McCay, I'd been mulling what it even means for a film to be \"successful\" in tackling sociopolitical issues in this climate, when each new day conjures up utterly ridiculous and dystopian realities just as bizarre as any screenwriter might possibly imagine, if not more so. Brooks' film at least makes clear what definitely doesn't work in this space: nostalgia, and a posturing of neutrality.   \n   Beyond that extremely low bar, parsing how to assess work that engages in politics is hardly straightforward, and admittedly dependent on a wholly subjective perception of what The Moment is and requires. The output has been a mixed, yet fascinating bag. Entertaining mainstream movies like Wicked: For Good and The Running Man gestured overtly at radical ideas through their protagonists' anti-authoritarian struggles, but ultimately offered little besides oversimplified stick-it-to-the-man rallying cries. In contrast, two great movies which both happen to star Josh O'Connor — The Mastermind and Wake Up Dead Man — kept political themes simmering in the background but deployed them to meaningful emotional effect.   \n   Some of the more confounding and messy projects this year were made in the spirit of \"challenging\" the audience — getting the people going, as it were. This can usually be done a couple of ways: didactically or, as is the case with Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, obtusely. The thorny campus melodrama stars Julia Roberts as Yale professor Alma, who begins to unravel after her star student Maggie (Ayo Edebiri) accuses her colleague Hank (Andrew Garfield) of rape. It's deliberately ambiguous in nearly every aspect of its storytelling — to the point of incomprehension rather than subversion.   \n   Less vague but much weirder were Ari Aster's Eddington and Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia, which both truthfully depict the chaos that's gripped American politics in recent years. Eddington stars Joaquin Phoenix as the sheriff of a small, rural New Mexico town in the early months of the pandemic, and astutely captures the absurdities and discord of that time — the social distancing, the fights over masking, the dangerous online conspiracy theory rabbit holes that sucked many people in as they isolated. Bugonia, too, feels intimately ripped from real life, as Teddy (Jesse Plemons), a conspiracy theorist who admits to having cycled through \"the whole digestive tract\" of ideologies (alt-right, alt-left, Marxism, etc.), dictates his many grievances to Michelle (Emma Stone), the pharmaceutical CEO he's kidnapped, because he's convinced she's an alien. (It sounds completely unhinged, until you remember the hoopla around Pizzagate.)   Sometimes getting a vibe right — and in these cases, that vibe is the ball of utter confusion we're swirling in — is enough to carry a movie. But Aster and Lanthimos have made plain their intentions of puncturing the \"echo chamber\" with their respective projects, and neither fully pulls that off. (Fittingly, Aster is also a producer on Bugonia.) For one thing, expecting any movie to meaningfully shift someone's perspective about \"the other side\" is a tall order when the leader of one \"side\" — or at least, one of many — is disseminating A.I. slop videos trolling his critics. But in Eddington, as with After the Hunt, presenting uncomfortable scenarios and contemptible characters takes precedence over storytelling. (Eddington also shortchanges its sole Black character, a cop played by Micheal Ward, by relegating him to the role of one-dimensional stand-in for Black Lives Matter-era anxieties when the news of George Floyd's murder breaks.)   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Emma Stone in Bugonia.\n                \n                    Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features\n    \n\n   \n   To its credit, Bugonia isn't ambiguous at all; the ending — spoilers incoming — follows the same basic plot twist as the Korean movie it's inspired by, Save the Green Planet!, revealing that Michelle the CEO is indeed an alien who was sent to earth to assess \"the human experiment\" and has deemed it a failure worthy of extermination. But its defeatist attitude nearly undoes everything that came before it, and contrary to feeling \"challenged,\" I was irked by how smug the conclusion felt. Is that all that there is?   \n   Other projects this year seemed to reflect filmmakers' attempts to look inward politically, and while they didn't always look hard enough, the results were still worth examining. Aziz Ansari's directorial debut Good Fortune, an enjoyable if clunky movie with a brilliant comedic turn from Keanu Reeves playing a guardian angel, is It's a Wonderful Life meets Trading Places. Ansari's character Arj, a struggling gig economy worker living out of his car in Los Angeles, swaps lives with Seth Rogen's wealthy tech bro Jeff, and the film mines comedy and occasional pointed commentary out of the many indignities Arj deals with as a courier and factory worker.   \n   For a middle-brow Hollywood comedy, there's a refreshing frankness about wealth inequality; it features unsubtle references to Amazon-related news stories, including a pro-union subplot. But the film clears a bare minimum and Ansari has readily acknowledged his situation is much closer to Jeff's than Arj's, which may account for why Good Fortune's critique ultimately lets the machinations of capitalism off the hook. Once Jeff and Arj's lives are switched back, the gig worker's financial circumstances are barely improved from the beginning of the movie, yet the message seems to be that Arj just needs to have a more positive outlook and channel it into activism. (Spike Lee's Highest 2 Lowest is undercut by a similar predicament in addressing wealth disparity.)   \n   That disconnect between filmmaking intent and impact is what keeps Paul Thomas Anderson's thrilling One Battle After Another from being as politically potent as some have argued it is. This is at least partially by design; he told the Los Angeles Times that he avoided \"put[ing] politics up in the front\" in service of presenting characters the audience would care about, and aptly noted that as timely as OBAA may seem, history is always repeating itself. (Fascism, he said, \"doesn't go out of style.\") Fair enough — but it's notable that he pointedly portrays white middle-aged malaise, an underground effort to shelter migrants from law enforcement agents, and a secret society of white nationalists.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Teyana Taylor in One Battle After Another.\n                \n                    Warner Bros. Pictures\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Warner Bros. Pictures\n    \n\n   \n   Less assured is his treatment of Black radicalism, which comes across as inadvertently disjointed or, less charitably, dismissive. In writing Perfidia (Teyana Taylor), a character who anchors the first third of the film before all but disappearing for the rest of it, Anderson pulls from markers of Blaxploitation and the sordid history of white men's fetishization of Black women to craft a thinly realized revolutionary — a figure whose hypersexuality is inextricable from her acts of rebellion. Taylor's magnetic and committed performance hints at how these tensions might have been more deeply explored, but it can't fully overcome the script's scattershot references and hurried characterization. (Here it also seems worth observing that while Anderson has been in a long-term relationship with Maya Rudolph, even casting her in small roles in Inherent Vice and Licorice Pizza, Black women characters have not been featured as prominently in his films before OBAA.)   \n   It seems the moment requires more than just presenting questions and what-ifs. It needs a stance, a commitment to an ethos and to the story it's ostensibly trying to tell, and an honesty about consequences. Ryan Coogler did this with Sinners, crafting a story that's richly entertaining while being acutely critical of the capitalistic and cultural forces that have leeched off Black Americans for centuries. Ditto Kleber Mendonça Filho's thriller The Secret Agent, a sprawling yet intimate film about political refugees living under aliases during Brazil's military dictatorship. In one scene, a resistance leader named Elza (Maria Fernanda Cândido) expresses sympathy toward former educator Marcelo (Wagner Moura) and his father-in-law Sr. Alexandre (Carlos Francisco) for the death of Marcelo's wife, and vows that Brazil will pay for it. \"I disagree,\" Sr. Alexandre replies plainly. \"With all due respect. It'll pay nothing. It won't pay s***.\"   \n   Of all these films, Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident may be the one most directly connected to the present moment, in no small part because the line between fiction and reality has been blurred by outside forces. Earlier this month, Panahi was handed a year-long prison sentence in Iran, as well as a two-year ban on all international travel. This isn't the first time Panahi, a longtime outspoken critic of the Iranian government, has been targeted; many of his films have been made in secret, including his 2011 documentary This Is Not a Film, which he shot while under house arrest and awaiting the results of an appeal of a six-year prison sentence and 20-year ban from making films.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr, Majid Panahi and Hadis Pakbaten in It Was Just an Accident.\n                \n                    ‎NEON\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ‎NEON\n    \n\n   \n   In Accident, Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), a former political captive, comes across a man he's convinced was one of his tormentors and kidnaps him to enact violent vengeance. (Plot details ahead.) The man, Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi), insists he's got the wrong person, and Vahid, now unsure, enlists some of the other victims to see if they might help identify him. Panahi puts the concept of justice under a microscope as they debate his identity and the usefulness of retaliation. Eventually, the man finally confesses out of desperation, arguing that he was simply following orders. He also adds that he at first held a guilty conscience, but he \"got used to it with time.\"   \n   Time hangs over Accident like a dark cloud, and the astounding final scene suggests Vahid will never be able to get away from the traumas he's endured. Understood a different way, it may also imply Vahid's ultimate decision — to show his tormentor mercy — while morally admirable, may have been in vain. On an episode of the podcast Filmspotting, co-host Adam Kempenaar said of Accident, \"It's one of those films … that is fundamentally about asking those questions — asking big, moral and ethical questions, but it also has clarity. It has conclusions. It leaves open some interpretation at the end … but within that, there is also clarity in what we see the characters do.\"   This is the thing: the masks have come fully off in political discourse, with all the -isms and -phobias no longer cloaked under thin layers of coded language and niceties. Families are being torn apart, jobs are being lost for criticizing the current administration, governmental systems have been effectively dismantled and rendered useless. Nuance is always welcome, but now is not the time for vagueness or subtlety in art that dares to wade into these issues. The expectation is not for movies to change the world, but to help make sense of it, even just a little. The films that brought us closest this year are the most likely to withstand time.   \n",

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Kennedy Center is ending the year with a new round of artists saying they are canceling scheduled performances after President Donald Trump's name was added to the facility, prompting the institution's president to accuse the performers of making their decisions because of politics.   The Cookers, a jazz supergroup that has performed together for nearly two decades, announced their withdrawal from \"A Jazz New Year's Eve\" on their website, saying the \"decision has come together very quickly\" and acknowledging frustration from those who may have planned to attend.   Doug Varone and Dancers, a dance group based in New York, said in an Instagram post late Monday they would pull out of a performance slated for April, saying they \"can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"   \n   Those moves come after musician Chuck Redd canceled a Christmas Eve performance last week. They also come amid declining sales for tickets to the venue, as well as news that viewership for the Dec. 23 broadcast of the Kennedy Center Honors — which Trump had predicted would soar — was down by about 35% compared to the 2024 show.   The announcements amount to a volatile calendar for one of the most prominent performing arts venues in the U.S. and cap a year of tension in which Trump ousted the Kennedy Center board and named himself the institution's chairman. That led to an earlier round of artist pushback, with performer Issa Rae and the producers of \"Hamilton\" canceling scheduled engagements while musicians Ben Folds and Renee Fleming stepped down from advisory roles.   The Cookers didn't mention the building's renaming or the Trump administration but did say that, when they return to performing, they wanted to ensure that \"the room is able to celebrate the full presence of the music and everyone in it,\" reiterating a commitment \"to playing music that reaches across divisions rather than deepening them.\"   The group may not have addressed the Kennedy Center situation directly, but one of its members has. On Saturday, saxophone player Billy Harper said in comments posted on the Jazz Stage Facebook page that he \"would never even consider performing in a venue bearing a name (and being controlled by the kind of board) that represents overt racism and deliberate destruction of African American music and culture. The same music I devoted my life to creating and advancing.\"   \n   According to the White House, Trump's handpicked board approved the renaming. Harper said both the board \"as well as the name displayed on the building itself represents a mentality and practices I always stood against. And still do, today more than ever.\"   Richard Grenell, a Trump ally whom the president chose to head the Kennedy Center after he forced out the previous leadership, posted Monday night on X, \"The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership,\" intimating the bookings were made under the Biden administration.   In a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press, Grenell said the \"last minute cancellations prove that they were always unwilling to perform for everyone — even those they disagree with politically,\" adding that the Kennedy Center had been \"flooded with inquiries from real artists willing to perform for everyone and who reject political statements in their artistry.\"   There was no immediate word from Kennedy Center officials about whether the entity would pursue legal action against the latest round of artists to cancel performances. Following Redd's cancellation last week, Grenell said he would seek $1 million in damages for what he called a \"political stunt.\"   Not all artists are calling off their shows. Bluegrass banjoist Randy Barrett, scheduled to perform at the Kennedy Center next month, told the AP he was \"deeply troubled by the politicization\" of the venue and respected those who had canceled but feels that \"our tribalized country needs more music and art, not less. It's one of the few things that can bring us together.\"   President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him. Scholars have said any changes to the building's name would need congressional approval; the law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person's name on the building's exterior.   \n   ___   Associated Press writers Steven Sloan and Hillel Italie contributed to this report.\n",

The complaint from the Legal Accountability Project against Judge Sarah Merriam of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit states that it is based on conversations with multiple former law clerks who fear retaliation if they come forward themselves.   \"She is a bully, in all the ways one might bully their employees: yelling, berating clerks, sending all-caps unhinged emails,\" said Aliza Shatzman, president and founder of the Legal Accountability Project.   \n   The Legal Accountability Project complaint, which has not been previously reported, was filed earlier this month and reviewed by NPR. The group says it marks the second publicly known complaint in four years about Merriam. Such complaints are not usually made public. Instead, they tend to be handled internally, by courts that police themselves, in part to protect the judiciary's independence and balance of power.   In a nearly yearlong investigation, NPR found a culture of fear about reporting judges and concluded that the courts' internal system often fails to result in meaningful change.   \n   In December 2023, an internal investigation into an unnamed judge on the 2nd Circuit by the court's judicial council found evidence that judge had an \"overly harsh\" management style. The investigation closed after that judge agreed to watch workplace conduct videos and receive counseling about how to manage staff in their chambers.   The investigation never named the judge, but a report from legal commentator David Lat in 2024 alleged that the judge in question was Merriam. The findings of that initial investigation resemble examples cited in the recent complaint against Merriam from the Legal Accountability Project.   Shatzman, from the Legal Accountability Project, said she's heard from clerks in 2024 and 2025 who spoke about the alleged abuses by Merriam, including from an unnamed clerk who quit this year after just one month on the job. Four others withdrew from offers to work for the judge, apparently after learning about the work environment, the nonprofit group said.   \n   An email to multiple officials at the 2nd Circuit appeals court did not receive an answer as of press time. A message left for Judge Merriam also went unanswered. A spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts declined comment. Court officials typically decline to comment on misconduct complaints while they are pending.   \n   Merriam is a former federal public defender and longtime magistrate judge in Connecticut. President Joe Biden nominated her to a lifetime tenured District Court judgeship, where she was confirmed in October 2021. He then promoted her to the federal appeals court, to which she was confirmed in September 2022.   Concerns about Merriam represent the latest flash point in a long-running debate about the power imbalance between federal judges and the often young clerks who work for them. People who work for the courts don't enjoy the same kinds of job protections that most other American workers do.   To resolve the earlier complaint, the unnamed judge agreed that the workplace relations coordinator for the 2nd Circuit would \"check in\" with clerks, to make sure they had been treated with respect and were free from abusive conduct.   But the recent complaint from the Legal Accountability Project suggests that the concerns of clerks on the 2nd Circuit persist.   The filing of the complaint could prompt court officials in the 2nd Circuit to conduct interviews with people who have worked for the judge, and to seek answers from the judge herself.\n",

    "body": "\n      Detroit gets its first new mayor in a dozen years, as 38-year-old Mary Sheffield is sworn in. Sheffield also becomes Detroit's first woman mayor.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  This week, Detroit gets its first new mayor in a dozen years as Mary Sheffield is sworn in. She is 38 years old. She's a Democrat, and she's taking over a city with a newly vibrant downtown and a rising national reputation. But she's got big challenges ahead, like spreading those wins across the city's many neighborhoods. NPR's Don Gonyea reports.DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Mary Sheffield takes office having been the overwhelming choice of Detroiters in the fall election, winning 77% of the vote. In her victory speech, she evoked the city's history, citing Motown and the Motor City.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARY SHEFFIELD: Let's not forget who we are.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah.SHEFFIELD: We are a city of innovators, of champions, of changemakers.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: That's right.SHEFFIELD: We put the world on wheels.GONYEA: She spoke of Detroit's role in the labor movement and in fighting for civil rights, and she highlighted her family connection to all of that. Her father is a pastor and community activist. Her grandfather was an early United Auto Workers organizer and union leader who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Detroit.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHEFFIELD: My grandfather, Horace Sheffield Jr...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yeah.(CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah.SHEFFIELD: ...Stood on the front lines...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Front lines.SHEFFIELD: ...During the Walk to Freedom, demanding jobs, dignity and justice for every Detroiter.GONYEA: Sheffield certainly has a mandate, but she's also got a tough act to follow. Outgoing Mayor Mike Duggan is very popular and leaves office after a dozen years. Early in his tenure, the city emerged from bankruptcy. He brought in new investments and oversaw a resurgence in Detroit's downtown. But Mayor Sheffield can also claim a share in that success, having served on the city council for 12 years, the past four as council president.Detroit's population is growing and crime is down, but poverty remains a major challenge. There's also a long-standing tension between downtown and the city's neighborhoods, which still feel neglected despite downtown's resurgence. Political analyst Mario Morrow notes that Sheffield campaigned heavily in neighborhoods.MARIO MORROW: She invested a lot of her time and platform on neighborhood development. So she's going to have to sit down and I guess have a come-to-Jesus meeting with the corporate leaders in Detroit to figure out how she's going to be successful with her goals and that big push to make neighborhoods viable.GONYEA: Reverend Charles Williams' church is in one of those neighborhoods. A Sheffield supporter, he says she needs to find partners in state and federal government. But dealing with the Trump White House, he says, is like walking a tightrope, especially given conflicts over National Guard deployments and immigration enforcement.CHARLES WILLIAMS: This is some of the political gamesmanship I guess you just got to have. Do we want to get in a fight with Donald Trump? No, not really. Do we want to get resources from the federal government so that we can continue on the prosperity and bring more prosperity to Detroit neighborhoods? Absolutely.GONYEA: Mayor Sheffield is Detroit's first ever woman mayor. It's a milestone many residents are applauding. She's also the first African American mayor in Detroit in a dozen years. Charlize Spanish is a student at Wayne State University in Detroit. She says both of those things are important to her.CHARLIZE SPANISH: As Black women, we have a bit of a struggle in society. So I feel like her being in this role would help bring up the Black woman and bring us together.GONYEA: With this new mayor in office, Spanish says she's hoping to feel seen and that the new administration can deliver for neighborhoods like hers. Mary Sheffield officially takes over as Detroit mayor on January 1, with a public swearing-in ceremony set for next week.Don Gonyea, NPR News, Detroit.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

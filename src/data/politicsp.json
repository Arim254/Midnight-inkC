    "body": "<div>\n      <p>The White House is renewing threats to send military force to Chicago. Meanwhile there seems to be no progress in ending the federal government's shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> And now we'll turn to NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.</p><p>DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey, Ayesha, good morning.</p><p>RASCOE: So Chicago is just one of the cities President Trump wants to send the military into, but it is the one that he keeps coming back to over and over again in his comments. Even before this weekend's events, talk to me a little bit about Trump's interest in Chicago.</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yeah, I mean, it was sort of a slow buildup to this point because the president has been teasing that he wants to send National Guard members to Chicago for a while now, months and months and months. And about a month ago, he started to escalate that rhetoric and said that the administration was, quote, \"going into Chicago,\" but he never specified when exactly that would happen. And then earlier this week, he mentioned the idea again and said it would be happening soon, and he also insulted the state's Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, calling him incompetent and stupid.</p><p>And so that leads us to this weekend. And as you and Michael were just talking about, Pritzker said the Trump administration basically gave him an ultimatum. Either he calls in National Guard members, or Trump will supersede him and do it himself. And of course, this all follows up on Trump sending in the National Guard to other cities - right? - like LA and DC. And more recently, he's been trying to send troops to Portland, Oregon, though yesterday, a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's move to send the National Guard to Portland, and I will note that that judge was appointed by Trump in 2019.</p><p>RASCOE: Has there been any progress on negotiations to end the federal government shutdown?</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yeah, well, the answer - the short answer, Ayesha, is no. There doesn't really seem to be an end in sight here. I mean, the Senate failed to move forward on funding proposals on Friday. Senate members are expected to return to the Hill tomorrow to try again, but the House will actually remain out of session, per House Speaker Mike Johnson. He said he'd call the House back in session once the Senate can come to an agreement on funding the government, but like I said, there really isn't much agreement going on between the two parties.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, onto another set of negotiations, there does seem to be movement in the talks between Israel and Hamas, though, right?</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yes, there has been some updates on the negotiations there. And, you know, just to catch up and put this into context, on Friday, the president posted on social media - his platform, Truth Social - and he basically gave Hamas this deadline of 6 p.m. this evening - that's Sunday evening - to accept the ceasefire deal that the White House had put together last week. And that deal was a 20-point plan that had requirements for Hamas to release all the hostages, for Israel to end its war in Gaza and for aid to immediately come into Gaza, and there were a number of other points as well. And Israel agreed to that deal, but Hamas said that they had lingering questions. But after Trump set that Sunday deadline, Hamas responded a few hours later and accepted the proposal.</p><p>But that doesn't mean the whole deal is all said and done. There are still some negotiations taking place. And yesterday, for example, Trump posted that Israel had agreed to the withdrawal lines that the White House had drafted in its plan, but the U.S. is still waiting to hear from Hamas on whether they accept that and other elements of the plan, as well. So definitely some progress and some movements, but nothing is finalized.</p><p>RASCOE: And meanwhile, the president is visiting Norfolk, Virginia. What's bringing him there?</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yeah, Trump is headed out there to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Navy. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will also be there with the president and the first lady, Melania Trump. It's planned to be this big celebratory event, though I will note that it is happening during the government shutdown, which means that active-duty service members are not getting paid. So I'm pretty curious if the president mentions that in his remarks as this shutdown heads into week No. 2.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Deepa, thank you so much.</p><p>SHIVARAM: Thank you very much.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>We look at where Congress is in negotiating its way out of a government shutdown that is in its fourth day, with no solution in sight.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> It is day four of the shutdown of the U.S. government. Since Tuesday, the U.S. Senate has taken up the same votes to fund the government temporarily with continuing resolutions. They still don't have the votes. Is there an agreement even on the distant horizon? We're joined now by NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt. Barbara, thanks for being with us.</p><p>BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey, thank you.</p><p>SIMON: The Senate yesterday failed once more to advance competing plans to extend federal funding and end the shutdown. How are those plans different again?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, one is a GOP plan that has already passed the House. It would fund the government through November 21. And then there's a Democratic counterproposal as well. That would fund the government through October, and it includes an extension of health care tax credits that were boosted up during the pandemic. Those are on track to expire at the end of the year. Now, Republicans have said they'll negotiate on that point, but only after the government is funded. And even then, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said it would not be a simple process.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JOHN THUNE: We can't make commitments or promises on the COVID subsidies because that's not something that we can guarantee that there are the votes there to do.</p><p>SIMON: There were a few Democrats who did support the Republican proposal this week. Has there been any more movement, or are the numbers tightening?</p><p>SPRUNT: No, they are not. It has been the same as that first vote, where we saw two Democratic senators and one independent joining Republicans. In fact, there's been so little movement on any kind of negotiation between the two parties that the Senate isn't even expected to stay over the weekend and do more votes. Here's Thune yesterday when asked about the possibility of weekend work.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>THUNE: Hopefully, over the weekend, they'll have a chance to think about it, and maybe some of these conversations start to result in something to where we can start moving some votes and actually get this thing passed.</p><p>SPRUNT: The impasse is essentially this - because the Senate needs Democrats to reach that 60-vote threshold to pass this kind of bill, Democrats, who, of course, have very little power as the party in the minority, say that demanding that there be some kind of negotiations between the two parties is appropriate. Unsurprisingly, Republicans do not share that view. They say Democrats are holding the American people hostage via this shutdown.</p><p>SIMON: Of course, in the meantime, the White House is proceeding with plans to cut programs and spending, often it seems in areas with lots of Democratic voters. What is the argument they make here?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, this is very much in line with the administration's thesis when it comes to its role in cutting programs and government workers. Items on the chopping block include some transportation projects in New York, the home state of both the House and Senate Democratic leaders. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told our colleague, Steve Inskeep, yesterday that the administration views that as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's fault.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)</p><p>KAROLINE LEAVITT: They can't show up to work right now. So that project is currently temporarily halted because of Chuck Schumer's shutdown. So Chuck Schumer did that to himself. He did that to his constituents in New York.</p><p>SIMON: And how do Democrats respond?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, Democrats have called this an intimidation tactic. They've blasted a plan from the White House's budget arm to fire federal workers instead of temporarily furloughing them, which is usually what happens in a shutdown. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he thinks that plan will backfire.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS: And the idea that you have a president who says, hey, your state voted against me. We're going to cut funding for you. That is not only illegal, not only outrageous. It is unconstitutional.</p><p>SPRUNT: So Democrats, like Sanders, insist these cuts are illegal, but it's an open question right now. There are several active lawsuits challenging the administration's cuts to congressionally approved spending.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Barbara Sprunt. Thanks so much for all your reporting.</p><p>SPRUNT: Thank you, Scott.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>The White House is using the government shutdown to push aggressive plans to further cut the federal workforce and control spending.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> The White House is using the government shutdown to advance plans to further cut the federal workforce and control spending. Budget Director Russell Vought is calling on agencies to fire staffers who were deemed to be nonessential during the funding lapse. And the Trump administration says it is freezing billions of dollars for projects in states - many of whom voted for Kamala Harris. NPR's Stephen Fowler joins us.</p><p>STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning.</p><p>SIMON: Let's begin first with the threats to fire federal workers. Has anyone actually been let go yet?</p><p>FOWLER: Well, so far, they're just threats. Here's White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaking to Morning Edition yesterday.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)</p><p>KAROLINE LEAVITT: The president is meeting with the Office of Management and Budget to try to understand what agencies are essential, what agencies do not align with the administration's priorities and values.</p><p>FOWLER: Here's the thing to think about though, Scott. Any of these reductions in force, or RIF, efforts that would come would have to be from the leaders of these federal agencies. President Trump can't make them happen, and neither can Russ Vought, the head of the Office of Management and Budget. RIF rules are pretty particular about the amount of time and notice they have to give before they can take effect. There's also a lawsuit that's been filed from federal workers union saying that the threat of firing workers, especially during a shutdown, is illegal.</p><p>SIMON: The administration's also announced several grants and projects are on hold just in the past few days and highlighted some in districts that are represented by Democrats. Is that related? How is it related to the shutdown?</p><p>FOWLER: Well, it depends on who you ask. The Energy Department says billions of dollars for clean energy grants are being canceled because of a review that found they, quote, \"did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.\" Others have noted that those projects are in more than a dozen states, including Minnesota and New York - all of them, Vice President Kamala Harris won in last year's presidential election. The timing of the announcement comes as the administration is doing a full-court press to get Democrats to get on board with their plans to reopen the government.</p><p>SIMON: Stephen, is this a lot like the DOGE effort that the president launched in January?</p><p>FOWLER: Well, that's the argument that Democrats are making. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said this in an NPR interview earlier this week.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)</p><p>HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, the Trump administration has been out of control since Day 1. They've been laying people off since Day 1. They've been firing federal employees since Day 1, and they've been violating the law since Day 1.</p><p>FOWLER: DOGE's work to cancel contracts and direct agencies to slash their workforce is an extension of Trump and Vought's long-held belief that the government should be smaller and spend less on things they don't agree with. Even as the White House has tried to circumvent the spending and budgeting power given to Congress, which Republicans have so far allowed to happen, it's worth noting that agencies have been hiring back hundreds of workers they let go earlier this year, and Treasury data shows spending has actually increased instead of decreased. That's because most of what the federal government spends its money on is mandatory items, like Social Security and Medicare - popular programs and things it would require Congress to change.</p><p>SIMON: Of course, Stephen, there have been government shutdowns before, and new administrations try to change spending plans and establish new policy priorities. Is this shutdown that different?</p><p>FOWLER: Shutdowns are an inherently partisan thing. But this time, it has been notable, Scott, how Republicans are using official government communications to attack one political party. Earlier this week, the administration added language to internal memos, official government websites, out-of-office email signatures and more to blame Democrats for the shutdown, and it's a potential violation of federal ethics laws.</p><p>As a comparison, in 2013, former President Obama sent a letter to federal workers ahead of a shutdown, thanking them for what they do and chiding Congress for being responsible, without mentioning Republicans specifically.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Stephen Fowler, who is part of our team that covers the restructuring of the federal government. Thanks so much.</p><p>FOWLER: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Messages posted on agency websites and in emails to federal workers across multiple Cabinet departments blamed congressional Democrats and, in some cases, the \"Radical Left\" for the shutdown and its impacts. (Republicans control both chambers of Congress but need Democratic support in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.)</p>   \n   <p>Many Department of Education employees who were furloughed due to the shutdown were surprised to see the following message inserted into their out-of-office replies: \"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\"</p>   \n   <p>Multiple employees told NPR that although the message was written in the first person and sent from their email, they did not write it and were not told it would replace whatever out-of-office message they had originally set up.</p>   <p>The language also differed from the model language the department had provided to staffers as they prepared for the shutdown, according to the lawsuit. Some staffers who tried to change their out-of-office messages to remove the partisan language found they were changed back, the lawsuit said.</p>   <p>The lawsuit argues the messages violate the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from compelling speech. It names the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon as defendants.</p>   <p>\"Without giving notice to their employees, let alone obtaining their consent, the Department of Education has replaced employees' out-of-office email messages with partisan language that blames 'Democrat Senators' for the shutdown,\" the complaint said. \"Employees are now forced to involuntarily parrot the Trump Administration's talking points with emails sent out in their names.\"</p>   \n   <p>In response to NPR's request for comment on the lawsuit, the Education Department press team replied with the same automated out-of-office message. In a statement to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/education-department-employees-email-automatically-changed-rcna235211\" target=\"_blank\">NBC News</a> on Thursday, before the lawsuit was filed, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said: \"The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?\"</p>   \n   <p>Government ethics experts have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5558393/government-shutdown-trump-ethics-hatch-act\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that the inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications could violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Hatch Act</a>, which limits political activity by civil servants in the executive branch.</p>   <p>\"The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party,\" Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm, said in a statement. \"Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation.\"</p>   <p>On Thursday, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, <a href=\"https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-10-02-garcia-to-osc-re-hatch-act-shutdown-agency-messages.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency which enforces the Hatch Act, to investigate the Trump administration's use of agency websites and official government emails \"to promote a false, partisan Republican political agenda.\" (The Office of Special Counsel is being led by an acting director since President Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5475191/trump-executive-power-supreme-court-whistleblower\" target=\"_blank\">fired</a> its Senate-confirmed leader <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5319326/trump-hampton-dellinger-watchdog-appeals-court\" target=\"_blank\">before the end of his term</a>. The agency is closed during the shutdown, according to its website.)</p>   <p>More than two dozen current and former federal workers contacted NPR in recent days to express concern about the politicized language they are seeing from agencies and officials.</p>   \n   <p>\"As a professional civil servant and human being I find the rhetoric shocking, offensive, and jarring,\" said one federal worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking publicly.</p>   <p>Six people shared screenshots of a weekly newsletter the Department of Veterans Affairs sends to \"Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors.\" Titled \"How the government shutdown impacts VA,\" the Oct. 1 newsletter said: \"President Trump opposes a lapse in appropriations, and on September 19, the House of Representatives passed, with the Trump Administration's support, a clean continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21. Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands.\" It went on to list VA services that would be affected.</p>   <p>\"I think the politicization of a VA newsletter which is intended only to let us know of our benefits should also be reported on,\" a veteran who received the newsletter and requested anonymity because they fear reprisal from the government told NPR.</p>   <p>\"The message was 100% factual, and even mainstream media outlets and reporters say the same thing,\" VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement in response to NPR's questions about the newsletter and the concerns veterans expressed about politicization.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Cory Turner contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>",

But in practice, the Assad-led Baath Party always dominated the parliament, and the votes were widely regarded as sham elections.</p>   <p>Outside election analysts said the only truly competitive part of the process came before election day — with the internal primary system in the Baath Party, when party members jockeyed for positions on the list.</p>   <p>The elections to be held on Sunday, however, will not be a fully democratic process either. Rather, most of the People's Assembly seats will be voted on by electoral colleges in each district, while one-third of the seats will be directly appointed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.</p>   \n   <p>Despite not being a popular vote, the election results will likely be taken as a barometer of how serious the interim authorities are about inclusivity, particularly of women and minorities.</p>   <p>Here's a breakdown of how the elections will work and what to watch.</p>   <h3>How the system works</h3>   <p>The People's Assembly has 210 seats, of which two-thirds will be elected on Sunday and one-third appointed. The elected seats are voted upon by electoral colleges in districts throughout the country, with the number of seats for each district distributed by population.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n

districts — chosen from a pool of applicants in each district by committees appointed for the purpose — should vote for 140 seats.</p>   <p>However, the elections in Sweida province and in areas of the northeast controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been indefinitely postponed due to tensions between the local authorities in those areas and the central government in Damascus, meaning that those seats will remain empty.</p>   <p>In practice, therefore, around 6,000 electoral college members will vote in 50 districts for about 120 seats.</p>   <p>The largest district is the one containing the city of Aleppo, where 700 electoral college members will vote to fill 14 seats, followed by the city of Damascus, with 500 members voting for 10 seats.</p>   \n   <p>All candidates come from the membership of the electoral colleges.</p>   \n   <p>Following Assad's ouster, the interim authorities dissolved all existing political parties, most of which were closely affiliated with the Assad government, and have not yet set up a system for new parties to register, so all candidates are running as individuals.</p>   <h3>Why no popular vote</h3>   <p>The interim authorities have said that it would be impossible to create an accurate voter registry and conduct a popular vote at this stage, given that millions of Syrians were internally or externally displaced by the country's nearly 14-year civil war and many have lost personal documents.</p>   <p>This parliament will have a 30-month term, during which the government is supposed to prepare the ground for a popular vote in the next elections.</p>   <p>The lack of a popular vote has drawn criticism of being undemocratic, but some analysts say the government's reasons are legitimate.</p>   <p>\"We don't even know how many Syrians are in Syria today,\" because of the large number of displaced people, said Benjamin Feve, a senior research analyst at the Syria-focused Karam Shaar Advisory consulting firm.</p>   <p>\"It would be really difficult to draw electoral lists today in Syria,\" or to arrange the logistics for Syrians in the diaspora to vote in their countries of residence, he said.</p>   <p>Haid Haid, a senior research fellow at the Arab Reform Initiative and the Chatham House think tank said that the more concerning issue was the lack of clear criteria under which electors were selected.</p>   <p>\"Especially when it comes to choosing the subcommittees and the electoral colleges, there is no oversight, and the whole process is sort of potentially vulnerable to manipulation,\" he said.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source

\"removed names from the initial lists that were published, and they did not provide detailed information as to why those names were removed,\" he said.</p>   \n   <h3>Questions about inclusivity</h3>   <p>There is no set quota for representation of women and religious or ethnic minorities in the parliament.</p>   <p>Women were required to make up 20% of electoral college members, but that did not guarantee that they would make up a comparable percentage of candidates or of those elected.</p>   <p>State-run news agency SANA, citing the head of the national elections committee, Mohammed Taha al-Ahmad, reported that women made up 14% of the 1,578 candidates who made it to the final lists. In some districts, women make up 30 or 40% of all candidates, while in others, there are no female candidates.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, the exclusion of the Druze-majority Sweida province and Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast as well as the lack of set quotas for minorities has raised questions about representation of communities that are not part of the Sunni Arab national majority.</p>   <p>The issue is particularly sensitive after outbreaks of sectarian violence in recent months in which hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze minorities were killed, many of them by government-affiliated fighters.</p>   <p>Feve noted that electoral districts had been drawn in such a way as to create minority-majority districts.</p>   <p>\"What the government could have done if it wanted to limit the number of minorities, it could have merged these districts or these localities with majority Sunni Muslim districts,\" he said. \"They could have basically drowned the minorities which is what they didn't do.\"</p>   <p>Officials have also pointed to the one-third of parliament directly appointed by al-Sharaa as a mechanism to \"ensure improvement in the inclusivity of the legislative body,\" Haid said. The idea is that if few women or minorities are elected by the electoral colleges, the president would include a higher percentage in his picks.</p>   <p>The lack of representation of Sweida and the northeast remains problematic, Haid said — even if al-Sharaa appoints legislators from those areas.</p>   \n   <p>\"The bottom line is that regardless of how many people will be appointed from those areas, the dispute between the de facto authorities and Damascus over their participation in the political process will remain a major issue,\" he said.</p>\n</div>",

Immergut barred any National Guard members from being relocated from any state for service in Oregon. The ruling came as Portland and Chicago prepared for the possibility that National Guard members will be deployed to their streets, as President Trump moves ahead with his plan to send troops to Democratic-run U.S. cities that he says require help to control crime and protect federal law enforcement officers.</p>   \n   <p>On Saturday, the White House said Trump \"authorized\" the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members, after vowing for weeks to send federal forces into Chicago. Earlier in the weekend, Immergut <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/05/federal-tactics-on-protesters-escalates-hours-after-judge-rules-against-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">temporarily blocked</a> the administration's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, though troops had arrived in Oregon from California.</p>   <p>Guard members will be used to protect federal property as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Federal Protective Service agents and other federal employees, according to a copy of a federal memo viewed by NPR. They will be sent to places where there are \"violent demonstrations\" in the state or where they are likely to occur based on \"current threat assessments,\" the memo said.</p>   <p>Already this year, the Trump administration has sent National Guard members to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Trump has said he also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5556831/portland-memphis-national-guard-trump-troops\" target=\"_blank\">intends to send troops to Memphis</a> with the backing of Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.</p>   \n   <p>The new deployment effort comes against the wishes of the Democratic governors of Oregon and Illinois, Tina Kotek and JB Pritzker, who say the Guard deployment is unnecessary and will escalate tensions.</p>   <p>On Saturday, Pritzker wrote in <a href=\"https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1974531904767656030\" target=\"_blank\">a post on X</a> that the \"Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will.\" Pritzker added: \"It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.\"</p>   \n   <p>In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump had activated the troops \"[a]midst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness\" in Chicago in order to \"protect federal officers and assets,\" <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2025/10/04/donald-trump-jb-pritzker-illinois-national-guard\" target=\"_blank\">WBEZ reported</a>. Trump has said National Guard deployments are in an effort to fight crime, despite violent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5534338/ice-chicago-boston-immigration-raids\" target=\"_blank\">crime being down</a> in Chicago and other cities.</p>   <p>On Saturday, Border Patrol agents <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/10/04/federal-agents-shoot-woman-they-say-boxed-in-authorities-in-brighton-park\" target=\"_blank\">shot a woman in Chicago</a>. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the woman was one of a group of drivers who rammed federal agents with their vehicles. The woman, Marimar Martinez, was released from the hospital and is now in the custody of the FBI, DHS <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/04/update-dhs-deploys-special-operations-after-multiple-violent-attacks-federal-law\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>. No agents were seriously injured, according to McLaughlin.</p>   <h3>A judge blocks Trump's effort in Portland, but Guard members arrive from California</h3>   <p>Also on Saturday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying the Oregon National Guard.</p>   <p>U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut ruled that the government had failed to meet the threshold for declaring that recent protests outside an ICE facility in Portland constituted a rebellion.</p>   \n   <p>Immergut, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said protests at the facility since July were generally limited to fewer than 30 people and were \"largely sedate.\" She added that the city's police force was trained in crowd management and could seek the assistance of other law enforcement agencies — and even the National Guard — if it needed to.</p>   <p>The Trump administration federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard last Sunday for a 60-day deployment, according to a memo sent to Gov. Kotek from the Department of Defense.</p>   \n   <p>As in Chicago, Trump was planning to send the troops to Portland over the objections of state and local leaders.</p>   <p>Trump said Sunday he hadn't seen the judge's order, but that \"that judge ought to be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>   <p>Despite the judge's ruling, Guard members were en route to Oregon, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He said in <a href=\"https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1974882275927249293?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\">a post on X</a> that the Trump administration had sent 300 California National Guard personnel to the state's northern neighbor.</p>   <p>\"They are on their way there now,\" Newsom wrote. \"We are taking this fight back to court. The public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States.\"</p>   \n   <p>Kotek said on Sunday that 101 California Guard members arrived on Saturday in Oregon and more were on their way. \"This action appears to [be] intentional to circumvent yesterday's ruling by a federal judge,\" she said in a statement.</p>   <p><em>Gigi Douban and Tom Bowman contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>",

That's where <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/over-24-million-consumers-selected-affordable-health-coverage-aca-marketplace-2025\" target=\"_blank\">24 million people</a> — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — buy health plans.</p>   <p>The argument is at the heart of the government shutdown that started Oct. 1. </p>   <p>Democratic lawmakers say extending enhanced premium tax credits is urgent, with open enrollment weeks away. Republican lawmakers say there's time to negotiate over a policy later, since the subsidies expire in December.</p>   <p>Who's right?</p>   <p>\"The window is rapidly closing,\" says <a href=\"https://www.insurance.nd.gov/about-us/commissioner-jon-godfread\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Godfread</a>, North Dakota's insurance commissioner. He says the enhanced subsidies need to be extended before open enrollment starts Nov. 1. \"Let's do this now.\"</p>   \n   <p>If lawmakers miss that deadline, he says, \"it's going to be really, really challenging to go back [to consumers] and say, 'OK, now we fixed it, please come back and shop at this market that you were priced out of.' I just don't believe consumers are going to do that.\"</p>   <h3>Insurance honchos in Red and Blue states all want it done</h3>   <p>Godfread insists this issue is not about partisan politics. He himself is an elected Republican, and he is also president of the <a href=\"https://content.naic.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a>, a membership organization of state insurance regulators across the country. \"Red state, blue state, appointed, elected — we have unanimous approval supporting these tax credits,\" he says.</p>   <p>The insurance commissioners have been <a href=\"https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/health-letter-enhanced-ptc-final-aug-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">warning lawmakers</a> about this impending problem for months. \"Since January, to be honest — we've sent four different letters,\" he says. He also spent the whole month of May in Washington D.C. meeting with members of Congress and explaining how an expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits will hit consumers very hard — he calls it a \"double hit.\"</p>   <h3>From $800 to $3,000 a month in premiums</h3>   <p>\"We're seeing increases in premiums because health care costs are going up, but when you also take away these subsidies, you essentially pull the rug out from people,\" he says. \"You're looking at a family that maybe was paying $800 a month for their health insurance and that jumps to $3,000.\"</p>   \n   <p>Premiums on average would go up <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\" target=\"_blank\">114% for consumers</a>, according to an analysis published this week by KFF, the nonpartisan health research organization.</p>   \n   <p>In North Dakota, the people who will be affected are mostly farmers and ranchers, Godfread explains. \"With these enhancements, we saw more farmers and ranchers purchasing coverage for their families, so it's been really, really good on that front,\" he says.</p>   <p>According to KFF, more than <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/quick-take/more-than-3-in-4-aca-marketplace-enrollees-live-in-states-won-by-president-trump-in-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">3 in 4 enrollees</a> in these ACA plans live in states President Trump won in 2024. KFF also <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/despite-budget-concerns-three-quarters-of-public-say-congress-should-extend-the-enhanced-aca-tax-credits-set-to-expire-next-year-including-most-republicans-and-maga-supporters/\" target=\"_blank\">published a poll</a> Friday that found that 78% of voters across the political spectrum are in favor of continuing the enhanced subsidies, including most Republicans and \"Make American Great Again\" supporters.</p>   <h3>Time for 'action'</h3>   <p>After a bumpy first decade, right now, the ACA insurance markets like Healthcare.gov are working pretty well, Godfread says. Consumers are happy with their options and find the plans affordable. If premiums spike for consumers and the healthiest people drop their coverage, \"that really sickens and weakens the risk pool,\" he says. Plus, more uninsured people mean more uncompensated care for hospitals, which presents its own problems for state budgets.</p>   <p>When he talks with lawmakers, Godfread says, sometimes they balk at the cost of the subsidies and at how expensive premiums have become. \"That discussion is separate,\" he argues. \"We can talk about the costs of health care and pharmaceuticals, all the pieces — but we've still got to get access to consumers, and that's what these subsidies have helped provide.\"</p>   <p>He is hopeful lawmakers might act since, at last, there's more attention and awareness about the policy issue. \"I'm happy we've had more conversations — we've got to get some action, though,\" he says.</p>   <h3>States stand ready to respond</h3>   <p>With <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/quick-guide/dates-and-deadlines/\" target=\"_blank\">open enrollment</a> just a few weeks away — Nov. 1 everywhere except Idaho where it's Oct. 15 — health insurers have locked in their rates for 2026. But Godfread explains there's still an opportunity to give consumers the subsidized rates if Congress acts quickly.</p>   \n   <p>\"Most states, if not all states, had their [insurance] carriers file two sets of rates — one with subsidies, one without,\" he says. \"And so if they do a clean extension of these subsidies, I think most states will be ready to go on that.\"</p>   \n   <p>The key, again, is getting it done before open enrollment begins, he says, so that consumers see a rate they can afford when they log in to shop for a plan. \"I don't see consumers taking multiple bites of this apple.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.</p>   \n   <p>Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state's biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump's hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>$1 trillion</u></a> over the next decade.</p>   <p>North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors, and caregivers.</p>   <p>In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates.

In a good week, her son will get 50 hours of skilled nursing care out of the 112 hours he qualifies for.</p>   <p>\"When you say, 'We're just cutting provider rates,' you're actually cutting access for him for all his needs,\" Fabrello said.</p>   <p>Shannon Dowler, former chief medical officer for North Carolina Medicaid, said that reduced payments to dentists and other providers will lower the number of providers in the state's Medicaid network and result in \"an immediate loss of access to care, worse outcomes, and cause higher downstream costs.\"</p>   \n   <p>The cuts in North Carolina \"don't have anything to do\" with the new federal law that cuts Medicaid funding, Dowler said.</p>   <p>\"This is like the layers of the onion,\" she said. \"We are hurting ourselves in North Carolina way ahead of the game, way before we need to do this.\" North Carolina alone is projected to<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/allocating-cbos-estimates-of-federal-medicaid-spending-reductions-across-the-states-enacted-reconciliation-package/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>lose about $23 billion</u></a> in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade.</p>   <p>More than 3 million North Carolinians are enrolled in Medicaid. Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.</p>   <p>\"We all hope it changes,\" Dowler said, adding that if it does not, \"you're going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members.\"</p>   <h3>Tough options</h3>   <p>Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina's Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.</p>   <p>But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.</p>   <p>\"It's a difficult moment for North Carolina,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is \"absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state.\"</p>   \n   <p>For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the \"most vulnerable in our community.\"</p>   <p>Western North Carolina Community Health Services' three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.</p>   <h3>Hospitals at risk of closure in Idaho</h3>   <p>Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates<a href=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/08/26/idaho-cuts-doctor-pay-rates-for-medicaid-more-cuts-could-come-health-and-welfare-says/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>4% across the board</u></a>.</p>   \n   <p>The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a<a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article311941139.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>recent op-ed</u></a> in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75 to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to \"to reduce staff or accept fewer residents.\"</p>   <p>Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted<a href=\"https://publicdocuments.dhw.idaho.gov/WebLink/DocView.aspx?id=34596&dbid=0&repo=PUBLIC-DOCUMENTS\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>19% growth</u></a> in Medicaid spending this year.</p>   <p>The Idaho Hospital Association's Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization's chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days of cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days of cash or less, she said.</p>   <p>\"Hopefully, none of them will close,\" Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.</p>   <h3>A big part of state budgets</h3>   <p>Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state's general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.</p>   <p>States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.</p>   <p>In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until the state began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She has received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>The president's bold statement surprised allies and raised new questions about whether U.S. policy toward the war is changing.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST: </p><p> Since President Trump declared last week that Ukraine can win the war against Russia, diplomats in the U.S. and Europe have been wondering, what does this all mean? Is this a complete 180 from his previous stance, or is it the president washing his hands of the war entirely? NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez has the story.</p><p>FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: It was last week when President Trump dramatically declared on social media that he now believes that Ukraine can reclaim all its land from Russia, which he described as a paper tiger. From the Oval Office, he criticized Russia for fighting aimlessly for years, with little to show for it except a crumbling economy.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Russia has spent millions and millions of dollars in bombs, missiles, ammunition and lives, their lives, and they've gained virtually no land.</p><p>ORDOÑEZ: But the reversal was not accompanied by any announcement of a change in U.S. policy. There was no new call for a peace agreement, no new sanctions or no new direct military support from the U.S.</p><p>RICHARD FONTAINE: Well, I think he's changed his analysis of the situation and his rhetoric about the situation but not his policy on the war and on Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>ORDOÑEZ: That's Richard Fontaine, who served in the George W. Bush White House and now runs the Center for a New American Security. What Trump did tell allies was that they could shoot down Russian aircraft that enters their airspace, that they can buy U.S. weapons and that they can stop buying Russian oil. Fontaine says, the subtext of all that was none of those things require the U.S. to be involved.</p><p>FONTAINE: I think he's removing himself from the personal diplomatic leadership role that he had assumed and was playing until just a few weeks ago, where he would singlehandedly end the war in Ukraine by bringing the parties together and getting a deal.</p><p>ORDOÑEZ: The White House dismisses the idea that the president has relinquished leadership. A senior administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations even pointed to statements by European leaders who praise Trump's leadership. But in order for pressure to be effective, the officials said Europe needs to do its part, and that means leaders can't call for an end to the war while simultaneously helping finance the war by purchasing Russian energy. While Europe has been scaling back, they haven't entirely eliminated purchases of the cheaper fuel.</p><p>ALINA POLYAKOVA: I think we've seen an evolution over time. The president, I think, came into office with one idea. I think he's learned about the complexities of the conflict. I think he has clearly understood that there's an aggressor, and that's Russia, and then there's a victim, and that's Ukraine.</p><p>ORDOÑEZ: Alina Polyakova is the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis. She says Trump is taking action and pointed specifically to Trump's support for NATO, including agreeing that member territories must be defended.</p><p>POLYAKOVA: Time and time again, I think there's a perception, and then there's facts. And I think the facts actually speak to quite consistent support for Ukraine.</p><p>ORDOÑEZ: Earlier this week, Trump met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu about ending another world conflict that he struggled with - the war in Gaza. Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO in the Obama administration, watched that meeting for any signs of what it could mean for Trump's commitment to ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p>IVO DAALDER: Is the United States finally going to use the leverage that it has?</p><p>ORDOÑEZ: He said after the meeting, where Trump announced a 20-point peace plan, that the president clearly appreciates it's going to be more difficult to address these deep-seated conflicts. But Daalder says Trump continues to declare peace before it's actually arrived. The war is not over. Daalder compared that announcement to others made in Alaska after Trump met Putin. Trump hailed progress and declared Putin would next meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That meeting never happened.</p><p>DAALDER: And so what you have is big drama, just like you had in Alaska. But when it really comes down to the end, there's no hat there. There's no cattle. There's just a declaration of peace without any follow-through or any reality.</p><p>ORDOÑEZ: And he added, you can't announce peace. You have to make peace, Franco Ordoñez, NPR News.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Instead, she was met with a notice of closure.</p>   <p>\"I just couldn't wait — could not wait to — get here,\" Ten Eyck said. \"We stopped at the [PistachioLand] right up the street there, and that's where we heard that it was closed.\"</p>   <p>Kathy Theriot was similarly heartbroken outside of the New Mexico Park. She had driven her children more than five hours from their home in Taos and hoped that they could experience the white sands she remembered from her childhood.</p>   <p>\"I've been waiting 10 years to show my kids White Sands and the day we come it's closed, which is very disappointing,\" Theriot said.</p>   <p>\"But it is really, really sad though that we get to the side of the road to enjoy part of our country because our elected officials can't get along.\"</p>   <h2>Vandalism and safety concerns</h2>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg\" alt=\"In this Jan. 10, 2019 file photo people visit Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California's Mojave Desert.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                In this Jan. 10, 2019 file photo people visit Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California's Mojave Desert.\n                <b>\n                    Jae C.

It has a pulse, but not many brainwaves,\" said former Rep. Jim Cooper, a Democrat who represented Tennessee for 32 years. \"It's hard to tell that it's even alive as an institution.\"   A record number of lawmakers are calling it quits ahead of the midterm elections next year and are running for the Capitol exits, pursuing different offices or retiring from political life altogether.   While there's a temptation to look at a diminished House as a symptom of the first year of the second Trump administration, former members told NPR that legislative stagnation and low morale have been building for quite some time.   \n   Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican who serves as president of the Association of Former Members of Congress, said the issues are growing deeper.   \"We've done studies showing the reason a lot of people are leaving is because it's not functional, because of death threats, because they're not getting anything done,\" she said in an interview.   \"The polarization is just dramatically different from even from the 'good old days' when you had the Clinton impeachment, but you got things like welfare and tax reform done,\" said Comstock, who was a congressional staffer in the 90s and served in Congress from 2015 to 2019. \"Even while Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton were going at each other, they realized you still had to get governing done.\"   More than a dozen former House members told NPR they see significant challenges for lawmakers and the institution of Congress.   \"I don't think anybody wants to have a job where you can't get the job done,\" said Illinois Democrat Cheri Bustos, who helped recruit candidates to run for office when she led the party's House campaign arm.   \"Right now,\" she said, \"it's increasingly difficult to get the job done.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"You go to Congress because you have ambition to try to fix problems that you see. I got tired of just voting on a bunch of messaging bills that were never going to be taken up by the Senate, that were all pretend.\" — Former Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., 2011-2017   \n   Former members detailed an increasing centralization of power in party leadership they said comes at the expense of committees. Members once saw committee leadership roles as a path to wield influence and power.    Dan Lipinski, an Illinois Democrat who served from 2005 to 2021, said a committee gavel means less now than it used to.    \"The speaker's office will tell the committee chair, 'this is what we want to see in this bill, this is what we don't want in this bill,'\" he told NPR after a day back on Capitol Hill talking to current members about their concerns. \"If the committees aren't working, then members don't really have an opportunity to be legislators.\"   Former members described how over time, intervention from leadership in processes like debates and amendments has limited the involvement of rank-and-file members.   \"The House operates from the leadership position top-down rather than from subcommittees moving up to full committees, where you have more bipartisanship,\" said Fred Upton. The Michigan Republican served from 1987 to 2023 and chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, where he played a critical role in his party's debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act.    Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican who served from 2005 to 2025, made it clear he left Congress \"loving it\" and finds it \"sour grapes and unbecoming\" when former members complain that Congress is diminished.    McHenry was once a member of House GOP leadership and chaired the Financial Services Committee. He pointed to a \"brokenness of the legislative process\" that he said has risen over the last fifty years.   \"The work stacks up in summer and then we leave the month before the budget is supposed to be done,\" he said. \"The rules of the Senate dictate you have to have 60 votes to do anything on policy, so everything for the majority party when they have the White House comes resting on the third piece, which is the budget process, to get everything you could possibly get done in the budget reconciliation process.\"   \n   McHenry said most of the agenda \"hinges upon one big piece of legislation\", which means if a measure isn't included in that bill, it's hard to get it through at all.   Former members said the congressional calendar — which now typically has the House working 3.5 days a week — leaves little time to build consensus.    \"There's real opportunity to get things done when you're able to spend time and you can see unity of purpose,\" McHenry said. \"But it's difficult with the congressional calendar.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"One member said, ‘I'll be traveling more days this year between home and Washington than I’ll actually be in Washington.' That’s an issue.\" — Former Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., 2005-2021    When Newt Gingrich became speaker in 1995, he shortened the congressional work week to roughly three days so that members would have more time in their districts — and so they could spend more time fundraising for re-election.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who served from 1989 to 2017, said it completely transformed the culture.   \"We didn't get barbecues together, we didn't do any of the things that used to happen on the weekends to make it a community and make compromises easier,\" he said. \"You have to know somebody a little bit before you trust them, and getting to know somebody is not just on the floor listening to speeches, for heaven's sakes. It's watching them deal with their kids. It's how fair they are on the basketball court.\"   Former members said the less time lawmakers spend with colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle, the more partisanship deepens.    \"When I arrived in Congress, I thought there was a lack of bipartisanship, that the degree of comity and cooperation had reached a new low,\" said Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan who served from 2013 to 2025. \"But I didn't realize those were actually the good days of my time in Congress.\"   \n   Multiple members said partisanship is increasingly rewarded when lawmakers with the most partisan rhetoric get more media coverage and fundraising dollars.    \"I got to the point where I wanted to have a conversation with a Republican colleague that I didn't know and [I said], 'I want you to know that I don't view you as my enemy,'\" said Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represented California from 1993 to 2025. \"Isn't that something, that I felt like I needed to say that?\"   The nature of the congressional calendar reveals another lifestyle challenge former members cited — the toll on families.   \"The biggest sacrifice is your spouse, your kids,\" said Upton. \"If you're in a district like mine, 650 miles away from D.C., you're gone half the time. So you're missing birthdays, school events, or just taking a walk with your spouse.\"   While it used to be fairly common for members to sleep in their offices while in D.C. to avoid the financial burden of paying for two homes, Congress has boosted what members can reimburse for living expenses. But Congress has not adjusted its salary for cost of living increases in line with the rest of the federal workforce.   \"I don't know any American citizen who would think their employer is being fair to them if they had not gotten a raise for their work since 2009,\" said Reid Ribble, R-Wis., who served from 2011-2017.   Raising pay — which sits at $174,000 — is a tough sell. But Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said it has practical implications for Congress, too.   \"Certainly a person with a lot more money who doesn't have to live on a congressional salary can do just fine without a raise, but there are others who cannot,\" said Dent, who served from 2005-2018. \"And so it's probably keeping some good people from running for Congress.\"   \n   Kildee said all these factors combined can make it hard to see why it's worth it.    \"A person thinking about running for Congress, realizing that will mean spending a lot of time away from home, going back and forth to Washington — but for what purpose?\" he said. \"Many of us were willing to do that because we saw a purpose. At the end of a week or the end of a month, you can look at what you did and see you made a difference in somebody's life and it was you making it happen. Whereas now it's much more difficult to see that.\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"It just feels like the moment we live in is much more dangerous and our politics more fractured than at any point I can remember.\" — Former Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa.,  2005-2018    Members said they've also seen the number of threats lawmakers face skyrocket in recent years.   \"There were always threats, but when I first arrived, those threats were rare, isolated instances,\" said Kildee. \"Now, rank-and-file members have to deal with threats that are routine.\"    Bustos described a major shift between when she was first elected in 2012 and when she left in 2023.    \"The first office I opened was in a secure building where you had to have a code to get in. I viewed it at the time as obstacles to reach our staff or to reach me,\" she said.    \"I made a decision to get out of that building because I wanted to be very accessible,\" she said. \"Fast forward toward the end of my career in Congress, and the staff didn't feel safe. We had to install these little buttons that would go to the local police department in case somebody was there and threatening. In the course of less than ten years, the mindset about accessibility changed because of the threats — and it's only gotten worse since then.\"   \n   Congress has a longstanding mutual aid program that allows local law enforcement to be reimbursed for providing security for members when they're in their home districts.   And in the aftermath of the targeted violence of state lawmakers in Minnesota this summer, the House launched a pilot program to increase lawmakers' security allotment.    U.S. Capitol Police told NPR its agents are on track to work through roughly 14,000 threat assessment cases by the end of the year.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"The Constitution intended Congress to be the most important branch of the government. It turns the lights on. It can shut government down. But now, Congress is so functionless, it's taken itself out of the game.\" — Former Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., 1983-1995, 2003-2023   Beyond concerns about the shift of power towards leadership at the expense of rank-and-file members, former lawmakers in both parties decried what they view as Congress abdicating its responsibilities to the executive branch.   \"I'm most concerned about the erosion of Congress' power of the purse authorities,\" said Dent. \"We're seeing on tariffs how the president is unilaterally able to raise taxes without a vote of the Congress. That's deeply troubling to me.\"   The Trump administration has defunded agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and utilized what's called a pocket rescission to cancel funding that has already been appropriated by Congress.   \"The ceding of power from Congress to the president has historically been an issue, but it has gotten much worse over the last 25 years and it has reached probably the highest level of congressional deference that we have ever seen,\" said Lipinski.   He described a recent conversation with a member who's part of  the whip team, which is responsible for counting heads on key legislation.   \"If a member says, either I'm undecided or I'm not going to vote with the party, then that member who is part of the whip team says, 'well, do you want a call from the president today or tomorrow?'\" Lipinski recalled. \"That kind of deference to a president, it doesn't matter who the president is, that is not the way our democracy is supposed to work.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"It's a very contentious time for many members of Congress, dangerous, challenging times. I think better times will come again, but we need patriots.\" — Former Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., 2013-2025   \n   Multiple former members told NPR when people ask if they should run for Congress, they recommend state offices instead.   \"I always tell people, really look at running in the state because you can make a difference there,\" said Comstock, pointing to two former House members — Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill — who won gubernatorial elections last month. \"They're still functioning.\"   Others insisted despite the growing challenges, there's still opportunities for good work to get done on Capitol Hill.   \"You can still make a difference,\" said McHenry. \"It is hard. It is definitely a beast that you can never master, you can just seek to improve day by day.\"   Cooper put it more bluntly: \"There are certain things that are more important than having work life balance in your job. If you want a decent country to live in, we better have a good Congress.\"   He said the country needs \"more good people to run.\"   \"Now, I'm embarrassed to teach at Vanderbilt Law School when the dumbest student in my class will make more in their first job than I made after 32 years in Congress. But hey, that's life, and a good congressman will never be paid what he or she is worth,\" he said. \"But you'll have a better country as a result. And you'll have a better place for your kids and grandkids to live. Isn't that worth something?\"\n",

Javitz Federal Building on in New York City in July 2025.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   An immigration judge issues a stern warning: \"If you don't show up, there is a good chance the court will order you removed.\"   She speaks to an immigrant from El Salvador in a quiet immigration courtroom in Hyattsville, Md., in November. Clad in an all-black dress jacket and shirt, the immigrant — who was identified only by the number of his case — swears that his last immigration notice was lost in the mail.   The judge tells him to check his mail regularly, ahead of his next appearance in January.   As the room empties out, the judge says out loud that there are a number of no-shows that day. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, attorney in court files motions to remove five people \"in absentia.\" The judge grants it. Those people can now be deported.   \n   A similar scene has played out, and increasingly so, in nearly every immigration court nationwide over the past year, according to immigration attorneys and NPR's early analysis of court data. More immigrants are not showing up for their mandatory immigration court hearings, allowing the government to order their immediate deportation.   \"What happened is that the word spread that if you go to court, you could get picked up from ICE,\" said Ruby Powers, an immigration lawyer based in Texas with cases all over the country.   In 2025, ICE turned to arrests directly from federal or immigration courtrooms in order to meet arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.   \"Those instances weren't consistent around the country, but at least the word had spread, the fear had spread. And so individuals were really hesitant to go into court,\" Powers said.   \n   The number of in absentia removals was generally already on an upward trend each year since 2022, said Andrew Arthur, resident law and policy fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit that advocates for lower levels of migration. Still, the number of such removal orders in fiscal year 2025 nearly tripled that of the previous year — topping over 50,000.   NPR calculated just how many people were ordered removed \"in absentia.\"   Each of the top 10 cities with the largest number of completed immigration cases in those courts is on track to end the year with a higher rate of in absentia removals than they started. That is according to data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review — part of the Department of Justice — from January through November.   \n   Each of these courts experienced an uptick in this kind of removal order starting in the summer months. That timeline is consistent with when immigration attorneys say ICE officers began arresting people inside the courts.   Loading...\n   NPR has spoken with the family members of immigrants who came to court in New York, for example, in place of their parents or partners — out of concern their loved ones might be detained. New York's courts have become notorious this year for scenes of violent arrests and confrontations with federal officers.   Powers said that there are other reasons people may fear coming to court, including that they may not win their case or get deported to a third country. There are logistical barriers, too.   \"A lot of times people don't even know that they have a hearing, or hearing dates can change without receiving the notice in the mail,\" Powers said. Sometimes immigrants can move and addresses are not immediately updated with the court, or go to places like apartment buildings that have less consistent mail delivery, she said. Notices can also be sent to completely incorrect addresses, which lawyers said has been an issue in years past.   Immigration attorneys across the country have noticed an uptick in this kind of removal order. Organizations like the Center for Immigration Studies have also spotted it.   Loading...\n   In many cases, the Department of Homeland Security has to receive a removal order issued by an immigration judge before it can physically deport any person from the U.S., Arthur said.   \"The more orders of removal in absentia or at the end of proceedings that are issued, the more people that ICE can then target for removal from the United States,\" he said.   Arthur said that immigrants who fail to appear opt to not take the government up on the offer for due process.   \n   \"The more people who are under final orders for removal … the more people who are going to end up in ICE custody because the law requires that ICE take into custody everybody who's under a final order of removal, notwithstanding the administration's stated focus on the worst,\" Arthur said.    Loading... \n   \"This appears to be well in excess of those historical trends,\" Arthur said.   Immigrants may have the opportunity to reopen their cases. However, most people in immigration court do not have legal representation, which they must pay for themselves.   Nonprofits like the organization Mobile Pathways have tracked a low rate of arrests in courts. But immigrant advocates said that doesn't mean the fear and negative perceptions go away.   \"It probably falls into the narrative that the administration wants to be portrayed, that these individuals are not participating in the process that they're supposed to,\" Powers said, about the rise in no-show removal orders.   \n   Some families she represents have fled violence, are working through trauma, or are navigating language and other barriers in addition to the immigration law system.   \"[They] are just making the best decisions they can with the information they have provided to them,\" Powers said, adding that most immigrants are still showing up for their court appointments. \"It's just because a lot of things are being stacked up against them. And that's why we're seeing these numbers.\"\n",

MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.   Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.   \n   \"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace,\" says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.   \"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate,\" she adds. \"It's just bad for the economy,\"   There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.   \n   Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.   \n   Lipton calls this capitalism by \"schmoozing,\" and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.   \"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products,\" she says. \"If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody.\"   Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, \"In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership.\"   China-style 'state capitalism'   Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or \"rules-based\" capitalism.   \n   This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.   But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of \"state capitalism,\" in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it \"crony capitalism,\" meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.   \"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that,\" says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in  President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.   \n   In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried \"about the current political and legal climate's impact on their companies.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang listens as President Trump speaks at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November in Washington, D.C. Nvidia has spent the year seeking the U.S. government's approval to sell more of its semiconductor chips in China.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says \"this narrative about how [President Trump] reshaped capitalism is significantly overstated\" and calls Trump's policies by and large \"the traditional free-market policy-making that you would expect coming out of a Republican Administration.\"   The official dismissed claims that the White House is engaging in \"crony capitalism,\" and says \"there are companies that are benefiting [from Trump's policies] whether or not they have a good relationship with the administration.\"   The official also notes that so far, the U.S. government has largely sought to take ownership stakes or revenue-sharing deals from companies that play a role in economic and national security: For example, Intel and Nvidia both sell the semiconductors at the center of the artificial-intelligence arms race with China. The U.S. government has also taken stakes or other interests in U.S. Steel and MP Materials, a rare-earth minerals mining company, among others.   \n   \"What we're trying to do is very much embracing the free market and the growth that it unleashes, but making targeted interventions where there's too much on the line,\" the official says.   Tech winners vs. everyone else in corporate America   Businesses largely welcomed President Trump's victory in last year's election, in part due to frustration with what they perceived as a harsh and \"anti-business\" regulatory climate under President Biden.   And some seem pretty happy with his first year in office — especially the tech billionaires whose \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are powering the A.I. boom.   \"The Magnificent Seven and Trump 2.0 are really on the same page to a large extent,\" says Daniel Kinderman, a political science professor at the University of Delaware who studies what he calls \"authoritarian capitalism\" and business responses to right-wing movements.    Some of President Trump's policies, including his sweeping tariffs and his changes to immigration policies for highly-skilled foreign workers, have complicated the business of Big Tech. But most tech CEOs have tried to avoid criticizing those policies publicly, and instead focused on donating to Trump's personal projects. Apple's Tim Cook, for example, this summer presented Trump with a gold-plated and glass plaque as his company promised to invest $600 billion in the United States.    Such gifts appear to have helped: Apple's iPhones have escaped the worst of Trump's tariffs.   Apple did not respond to a request for comment.   Kinderman points out that for wealthy and powerful CEOs, Trump's degree of personal involvement in their businesses at least makes it efficient to deal directly with him — if they can keep him happy — instead of wading through the slow and complicated red tape of federal regulatory processes.   \"These companies are a huge portion of the American economy,\" he says. \"And I think Trump is also giving them, to a large extent, what they want.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In August, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented President Trump with a gold-plated and glass plaque, as his company pledged to invest a total of $600 billion in the United States.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Still, he and others warn that, taken to the extreme, codependent relationships between political leaders and CEOs don't always end well for the latter.   \n   In more authoritarian countries, where leaders exert much more control over private businesses, the stakes can be especially fraught. Russia, Hungary, and China all exercise some form of state-controlled capitalism, where an autocratic leader cultivates relationships with oligarchic business CEOs — and can quickly force them out of favor.   As one extreme example, Ballou-Aares invokes Jack Ma, the Alibaba founder who built one of China's biggest tech companies before criticizing the country's financial regulations … and then largely disappearing from public view for several years.   \"We know that crony capitalism never really ends well for most companies,\" she says. \"I mean, tell Jack Ma that autocracy is okay for business.\"   'Most CEOs are pretty frustrated'   Outside of Big Tech, many businesses feel a lot more conflicted about how President Trump is reshaping U.S. capitalism. Some have even filed lawsuits against the administration, over its tariffs and its immigration policies.   \"Despite the handful of tech titans that do seem to admittedly genuflect at the White House and at Mar-a-Lago, most CEOs are pretty frustrated with what's happening,\" says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor who regularly speaks with CEOs.   Pockets of frustration from corporate America have become more visible recently. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the administration over its plans to start charging $100,000 for H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers — although it did so while praising Trump's \"ambitious agenda.\"   \n   And JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon, who runs the country's largest bank and is one of the most prominent non-tech CEOs in the country, recently told CNN why his company had declined to donate to Trump's White House ballroom.   \"Since we do a lot of contracts with governments here and around the world, we have to be very careful about how anything is perceived,\" Dimon said. \"We're quite conscious of risks we bear by doing anything that looks like buying favors or anything like that.\"   \n   That said, most businesses are reluctant to publicly criticize President Trump or his policies. Smaller companies lack the power to effectively stand up to the White House. And even those running the country's biggest companies are unwilling to draw the personal attacks that Trump can often wield, or the ensuing partisan boycotts and financial damage that can follow.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Earlier this month, demolition work continued where the East Wing once stood at the White House. President Trump ordered the East Wing and Jacqueline Kennedy Garden leveled to make way for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom that he says will be paid for with private donations from companies including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Many businesses have neither the appetite nor the capacity to take on the U.S. government. They just want to focus on making money, even if that means adapting to dramatic tariffs or other sharp shifts in government policy.   \"It's tactical fire-fighting,\" says Drew DeLong, who advises businesses around the world as head of corporate statecraft for the consulting company Kearney, and who served in the State Department during Trump's first administration.   \"Every moment and every hour you spend on tariff mitigation is one less hour that you spend on innovation,\" he says. \"There is an urgency towards fire-fighting as best as they possibly can, but there's also a fatigue.\"   'Merger review has been weaponized'   The Trump Administration's approach to approving — or not — corporate mergers has drawn some of the highest scrutiny, because of the nexus of political and business issues at stake.   \n   For example, the Federal Communications Commission this year approved several telecommunications mergers only after Verizon and T-Mobile agreed to terminate internal policies around \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" or DEI. Then it threatened to take federal action against some ABC affiliates over Jimmy Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's killing on his ABC late-night show; the owners of some of those stations were also seeking federal approvals for mergers. (ABC parent Walt Disney suspended Kimmel's show for almost a week, before reinstating him. ABC did not respond to requests for comment.)   \"Merger review has been weaponized into a tool for control,\" says Elizabeth Wilkins, the former chief of staff to Lina Khan, who oversaw U.S. merger review as chair of President Biden's Federal Trade Commission.   \n   \"With those kinds of tools hanging over corporate leaders' heads, we have seen an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear — which breeds silence,\" adds Wilkins, who now runs the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.   The exception is, again, for leaders who cultivate close ties with the president. This year, the White House helped broker a deal for a coalition of U.S. investors to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok — and asked for an unusual multibillion-dollar payment to the federal government, which business experts have compared to a \"shakedown\" or \"extortion.\" Some of those same investors, including Trump ally Larry Ellison and his son, David, are now seeking even more media deals.   Some business experts say now that corporate America has a better idea of President Trump's playbook in this administration, they expect to see companies and their executives feel more confident about how and when to push back against White House policies that they think will damage their businesses and the wider economy.   \"I think it is clear that the administration's approach here is broadly unpopular, including with business,\" says Ballou-Aares.   But Kearney's DeLong, the veteran of Trump's first administration, warns businesses to brace for much more policy change, and uncertainty about what capitalism and the economy will look like in the future.   \"This is just year one,\" he says. \"Where do we go [during] the rest of this administration? Where do we go after?\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Extensive redactions of the Epstein files add to the political pressure President Trump is already under for his handling of the economy.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  It's the Winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and from San Diego to Detroit to here in Washington, D.C., we've got the least amount of sunlight 2025 has to offer. But we do have NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha.RASCOE: And you are a light, I have to say.SHIVARAM: Oh, thank you.(LAUGHTER)SHIVARAM: As are you.RASCOE: Thank you. Sunlight, transparency. Now, making a sharp turn here.SHIVARAM: (Laughter).RASCOE: How much sunlight and transparency are we finding in the evidence in the Epstein files that the Justice Department was legally required to release at the beginning of this weekend?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Well, just to catch up for a second. I mean, this batch of documents started getting released on Friday evening, but there was a lot that was redacted, Ayesha, including some of the documents that were really sought after, like the testimony from the New York grand jury. I will say what was included in this recent release of files was some pictures, significant ones like former President Bill Clinton standing with Jeffrey Epstein. Another one of Clinton in a hot tub with a person whose face has been redacted. Notably, though, President Trump was rarely named in this batch of files. And that really stands out compared to the last round of files that were released by the House Democratic Oversight Committee last month, where Trump was named in that batch more than 1,000 times.RASCOE: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday that the DOJ would make more files public in the coming weeks. Does that satisfy lawmakers across the political spectrum who worked to pass the law mandating disclosure?SHIVARAM: So far, not really. Congressman Ro Khanna - he's a Democrat who co-sponsored the legislation on the Hill to release these files. He called this release of documents on Friday incomplete at best. There were witness interviews with the FBI that he says should be released, as well as a draft indictment from the first Epstein case that was also something he was looking for. And he wants an explanation from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on the timeline of when the rest of these files are going to be made public.On the other side of the aisle, Congressman Thomas Massie, a Republican - he's been posting a lot on social media agreeing with Khanna, saying that not releasing all of these documents means that Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche are violating the law. And Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who, you know, is on her way out of Congress, said that the release of these files is, quote, \"not MAGA.\"So there's a lot of lingering questions after this small release of files from the DOJ, with so many things that were redacted. And then to add on to that concern over the weekend, more than a dozen of the files that were released and made public online were removed from the DOJ website, and that included one file that was, you know, Trump's photo that was on a desk surrounded by other photographs.So this issue of transparency around the Epstein files, you know, is ongoing. It's been dogging Trump for months. And with this recent move by the DOJ, I mean, this news cycle is just not going to go away. It's going to extend into next year, which I will note, is a midterms year, and that could really complicate things for Republicans.RASCOE: And meanwhile, the administration is continuing to ramp up pressure on Venezuela.SHIVARAM: Yeah. There has been mounting pressure from Trump on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Just yesterday, the U.S. stopped another oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. It's the second time that's happened in the last two weeks. And this second incident comes after Trump announced a, quote, \"blockade\" on sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of Venezuela that happened earlier this week. Now, Venezuela has responded and called the U.S. actions, quote, \"criminal,\" but this is just a complicated situation that has been growing and growing and growing. As you'll remember, the U.S. has been attacking boats off the coast of Venezuela, claiming that they are smuggling drugs, and more than a hundred people have been killed in those strikes.RASCOE: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Deepa, thank you so much.SHIVARAM: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

While Musk no longer leads DOGE, the idea of trimming the federal government remains.\n                \n                    SAUL LOEB/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        SAUL LOEB/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Earlier this month, billionaire Elon Musk, the one-time DOGE leader and Trump adviser, sat down with Katie Miller on her podcast to reflect on his time with the administration.   He called DOGE's work \"a little bit successful\" but said he wouldn't do it again if given the chance.   \"We were somewhat successful, Musk said. \"I mean we stopped a lot of funding … that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful.\"   Musk left his role with DOGE in May after legal setbacks and clashes with Trump's cabinet.   Yet even as he retreated from Washington, the idea that slashing wasteful spending will lead to profound cuts to the nation's growing deficit remains central to the Trump administration's vision of a slimmed down bureaucracy.   \n   While many of DOGE's initial outsized promises to increase efficiency and slash spending never fully materialized, the Trump administration has not given up on those goals.   Here's a look back at some of what DOGE did and did not accomplish in its inaugural year and how the Trump administration is calibrating its tactics to make more incremental and less high-profile tweaks to federal agencies.   Shrinking the federal workforce    Agencies ordered to fire employees earlier in the year by DOGE were hiring back hundreds of workers ahead of the end of the fiscal year in September, while the Office of Management and Budget tried to lay off more people during the longest-ever federal government shutdown in October.    Still, by the end of 2025, some 317,000 federal employees will be out of the government, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some federal agencies and programs, like the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and much of the Education Department have been effectively eliminated.   \n   Despite those reductions and a push to cut contracts and terminate leases, the federal government is still spending more money than it brings in.   Focus on slashing 'Democrat priorities'   Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought is leading the push to streamline the federal workforce. Vought has long called for the federal government to have a smaller footprint, most recently including efforts to enact mass reductions-in-force at several agencies during the federal government shutdown that started in October and was blocked by the courts.   \n   Also during the shutdown, the Trump administration announced several rounds of funding cuts aimed at what the president called \"Democrat priorities\" like transportation and energy grants, continuing the trend of spending money on policies they like and removing funding from policies that Trump disagrees with.   Trump's priorities rely on the sharing of sensitive data   DOGE's push to consolidate sensitive personal data across federal agencies has survived legal challenges and been used for the administration's immigration enforcement priorities.   That includes the transformation of a federal citizenship verification database, demands for states to hand over information about federal food aid recipients and more. At least some of those efforts have wrongly flagged U.S. citizens, NPR has previously reported.   \n   Government restructuring efforts still exist   Even though the DOGE entity has not dominated the headlines in recent months since Musk departed the federal government, the focus of its work has not stopped.   Many of Musk's top allies and DOGE lieutenants have transitioned to become full-time employees at the agencies they were detailed to.   An Aug. 21, 2025 executive order signed by the president created the National Design Studio that aims to \"fill the digital potholes\" of the federal government's online systems and websites.   \n   The Chief Design Officer in charge of this effort, Joe Gebbia, is an Airbnb cofounder and Musk associate who led DOGE's overhaul and digitization of the federal employee retirement system at the Office of Personnel Management.   The studio is responsible for the website for the new \"Trump Accounts,\" tax-advantaged investment accounts for U.S. children created under Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" signed earlier this year. Other projects include the Energy Department's \"Genesis Mission\" and the US Tech Force, a two-year program seeking \"an elite corps of engineers to build the next generation of government technology.\"   Federal spending still isn't reigned in   One of the stated reasons DOGE was created was to tackle the national debt, which grew more than $2.2 trillion from October 1, 2024 to Sept. 30, 2025 to more than $38 trillion.   That number is expected to grow by at least three trillion additional dollars in the next decade over baseline projections due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law earlier this year that includes tax cuts and new spending on Trump's priorities.   \"President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement provided to NPR.   The White House did not directly respond to NPR's questions about the government's deficit spending or the increase in the national debt.   From the start of the new fiscal year in October to the end of November, the federal government has spent nearly a half trillion dollars more than it has brought in, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That's slightly less than the same period last year.   The vast majority of federal spending — about 65% this fiscal year — goes toward Social Security, Medicare, health programs, income security and veterans' benefits and services. Another smaller percentage has been interest payments towards the country's debt, plus 14% for national defense.   \n   DOGE's work did not touch on these broadly popular programs that would require Congressional action to change.\n",

Turning Point leader Erika Kirk, who took the helm after the assassination of her husband, Charlie Kirk, has endorsed Vance as a potential successor to President Donald Trump, a helpful nod from an influential group with an army of volunteers.   \n   But the tension on display at the four-day gathering foreshadowed the treacherous political waters that Vance, or anyone else who seeks the next Republican presidential nomination, will need to navigate in the coming years. Top voices in the \"Make America Great Again\" movement are jockeying for influence as Republicans begin considering a future without Trump, and there is no clear path to holding his coalition together.   Defining a post-Trump GOP   The Republican Party's identity has been intertwined with Trump for a decade, but he's constitutionally ineligible to run for reelection despite his musings about serving a third term. Tucker Carlson said people are wondering, \"who gets the machinery when the president exits the scene?\"   So far, it looks like settling that question will come with a lot of fighting among conservatives. The Turning Point conference featured arguments about antisemitism, Israel and environmental regulations, not to mention rivalries between leading commentators.   Ben Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, used his speech on the conference's opening night to denounce \"charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty.\"   \"These people are frauds and they are grifters and they do not deserve your time,\" Shapiro said. He specifically called out Carlson for hosting Fuentes for a friendly interview on his podcast.   \n   Carlson brushed off the criticism when he took the stage barely an hour later, and he said the idea of a Republican \"civil war\" was \"totally fake.\"   \"There are people who are mad at JD Vance, and they're stirring up a lot of this in order to make sure he doesn't get the nomination,\" he said. Carlson described Vance as \"the one person\" who subscribes to the \"core idea of the Trump coalition,\" which Carlson said was \"America first.\"   Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet framed the discord as a healthy debate about the future of the movement, an uncomfortable but necessary process of finding consensus.   \"We're not hive-minded commies,\" he wrote on social media. \"Let it play out.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Supporters cheer during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest 2025, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025, in Phoenix.\n                \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jon Cherry/AP\n    \n\n   \n   If you love America, you're welcome in the movement, Vance says   Vance acknowledged the controversies that dominated the Turning Point conference, but he did not define any boundaries for the conservative movement besides patriotism.   \"We don't care if you're white or black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between,\" he said.   Vance didn't name anyone, but his comments came in the midst of an increasingly contentious debate over whether the right should give a platform to commentators espousing antisemitic views, particularly Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as working to preserve America's white, Christian identity. Fuentes has a growing audience, as does top-rated podcaster Candace Owens, who routinely shares antisemitic conspiracy theories.   \"We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,\" he said.   Vance ticked off what he said were the accomplishments of the administration as it approaches the one-year mark, noting its efforts at the border and on the economy. He emphasized efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies, drawing applause by saying they had been relegated to the \"dustbin of history.\"   \n   \"In the United States of America, you don't have to apologize for being white anymore,\" he said.   Vance also said the U.S. \"always will be a Christian nation,\" adding that \"Christianity is America's creed, the shared moral language from the Revolution to the Civil War and beyond.\"   Those comments resonated with Isaiah White-Diller, an 18 year-old from Yuma, Arizona, who said he would support Vance if he runs for president.   \"I have my right to be Christian here, I have my right to say whatever I want,\" White-Diller said.   Turning Point backs Vance   Vance hasn't disclosed his future plans, but Erika Kirk said Thursday that Turning Point wanted Vance \"elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible.\" The next president will be the 48th in U.S. history.   Turning Point is a major force on the right, with a nationwide volunteer network that can be especially helpful in early primary states, when candidates rely on grassroots energy to build momentum. In a surprise appearance, rapper Nicki Minaj spoke effusively about Trump and Vance.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nicki Minaj speaks during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest 2025, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025, in Phoenix.\n                \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jon Cherry/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Vance was close with Charlie Kirk, and they supported each other over the years. After Kirk's assassination on a college campus in Utah, the vice president flew out on Air Force Two to collect Kirk's remains and bring them home to Arizona. The vice president helped uniformed service members carry the casket to the plane.   Emily Meck, 18, from Pine City, New York, said she appreciated Vance making space for a wide variety of views.   \"We are free-thinkers, we're going to have these disagreements, we're going to have our own thoughts,\" Meck said.   Trump has spoken highly of both Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, even suggesting they could form a future Republican ticket. Rubio has said he would support Vance.   Asked in August whether Vance was the \"heir apparent,\" Trump said \"most likely.\"   \n   \"It's too early, obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favorite at this point,\" he said.\n",

Some lawmakers said the department's release of files relating to Jeffrey Epstein had too many redactions as well as missing information.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Two lawmakers are threatening a seldom-used congressional sanction against the Department of Justice over what they say is a failure to release all of its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by a deadline set in law.   Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie spearheaded the effort to force the Epstein files' release by co-sponsoring the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but both have said the release had too many redactions as well as missing information.   \n   \"I think the most expeditious way to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday. \"Basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.\"   Inherent contempt refers to Congress' authority to fine or arrest and then bring to trial officers who are obstructing legislative functions. It was last successfully used in the 1930s, according to the American Bar Association.   Khanna, a California Democrat, noted that the House would not need the Senate's approval to take such action, which he said would result in a fine for Attorney General Pam Bondi.   \"I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable,\" he told Face the Nation.   Justice Department defends partial release   The Justice Department on Sunday defended its initial, partial release of documents, some of which were heavily redacted.   \"The material that we released on Friday, or the material that we're going to release over the next a couple of weeks, is exactly what the statute requires us to release,\" said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on NBC's Meet the Press, referring to the Epstein Files Transparency Act.   \n   Blanche said the administration has hundreds of lawyers going through the remaining documents to ensure that victims' information is protected. Still, lawmakers from both parties remain unsatisfied.   \"Any evidence or any kind of indication that there's not a full reveal on this, this will just plague them for months and months more,\" said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on ABC's This Week. \"My suggestion would be — give up all the information, release it.\"   Blanche told NBC he was not taking the threats of contempt seriously.   \n   \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on,\" he said, adding that lawmakers who have spoken negatively about Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \"have no idea what they're talking about.\"   Back and forth over Trump photo   The trove of documents released Friday contained little new information about Epstein, prompting accusations that the department wasn't complying with the law. There was a photograph included in Friday's release that showed a desk full of photos, including at least one of President Trump. It was among more than a dozen photographs no longer available in the Justice Department's \"Epstein Library\" by Saturday, NPR found.   \n   On Sunday, the Justice Department re-uploaded the photo of the desk, and provided an explanation on X.   \"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the post read. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"   The Justice Department did not offer an explanation for the other photos whose access had been removed.   Blanche told NBC the Justice Department was not redacting information around Trump or any other individual involved with Epstein. He said the Justice Department had removed photos from the public files \"because a judge in New York has ordered us to listen to any victim or victim rights group, if they have any concerns about the material that we're putting up.   \n   \"And so when we hear concerns, whether it's photographs of women that we do not believe are victims, or we didn't have information to show that they were victims, but we learned that there are concerns, of course, we're taking that photograph down and we're going to address it,\" he said.   Earlier Sunday, the Justice Department also posted to X a new version of the 119-page transcript of grand jury proceedings in the case of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The original version had been entirely redacted.   \n   \"Here is the document now with minimal redactions. Documents and photos will continue to be reviewed consistent with the law and with an abundance of caution for victims and their families,\" the Justice Department wrote in its post.\n",

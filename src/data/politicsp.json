Though a Republican challenge remains in court, the ruling Friday is a boost for Democrats' efforts to counter the Republican-led redistricting President Trump has set off in other states.   Republicans had sued to block the redistricting, alleging that Democrats in the Virginia Legislature did not follow the proper process when they set the special election. A circuit court judge in rural Virginia ruled in Republicans' favor Jan. 27 and Democrats appealed that ruling.   \n   The state supreme court said that it would still hear arguments about the issues and did not grant the Democrats' appeal but the court wrote that has \"no effect on the referendum scheduled for April 21.\" It set deadlines for the submission of arguments after the election.   \n   Democrats took it as a sign they have court backing to hold the referendum. Democratic Speaker of the Virginia House Don Scott said the fact the court let the election proceed while it considers the case \"tells you everything you need to know.\"   Virginia Republicans see it as a power grab, Democrats point to other states   Republicans say the redistricting is a partisan power grab that will leave their party's representation in Congress lower than the portion of Republican residents.   A top Republican acknowledged the election was on but said the party would continue to fight the case. \"That just shows that we've got to win the referendum and we got to win in court. I think we can do both,\" Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore said.   Democrats have proposed a new voting map that could help their party win four more seats in the House, converting the state's delegation from six Democrats and five Republicans to 10 Democrats and one Republican.   \n   They argue they are responding in kind to the Republican-led redistricting Trump has started in other states. At his urging last summer, Texas Republicans redrew that state's voting map to help the GOP win five more seats. Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina also redistricted for a seat in each state.   Democrats in California, in a process similar to the one Virginia has started, won voter approval to counter Texas and draw a new map that could help them win five seats in November.   Overall, Republicans still lead the redistricting scramble by a couple seats and Virginia's new map could still be followed by Republicans in Florida tilting some seats their way in April.   Trump's agenda for the last two years of his term could hinge on Republicans maintaining their narrow lead in the House of Representatives, which would stave off possible Democratic efforts to block his policies and launch investigations into his administration.

Kennedy Jr. hasn't held true to many of the promises he made while appealing to U.S. senators concerned about the longtime anti-vaccine activist's plans for the nation's care.   Kennedy squeaked through a narrow Senate vote to be confirmed as head of the Department of Health and Human Services only after making a number of public and private guarantees about how he would handle vaccine funding and recommendations as secretary.   Here's a look at some of the promises Kennedy made during his confirmation process.   \n   The childhood vaccine schedule   In two hearings in January 2025, Kennedy repeatedly assured senators that he supported childhood vaccines, noting that all his children were vaccinated.   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., grilled Kennedy about the money he has made in the private sector from lawsuits against vaccine makers and accused him of planning to profit from potential future policies making it easier to sue.   \"Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it,\" Warren said during the Senate Finance Committee hearing. \"Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in.\"   Warren's statement prompted an assurance by Kennedy.   \"Senator, I support vaccines,\" he said. \"I support the childhood schedule. I will do that.\"   Days later, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, declared that Kennedy had pledged to maintain existing vaccine recommendations if confirmed.    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   Cassidy, a physician specializing in liver diseases and a vocal supporter of vaccination, had questioned Kennedy sharply in a hearing about his views on shots.   \"If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommendations without changes,\" Cassidy said during a speech on the Senate floor explaining his vote for Kennedy.   A few months after he was confirmed, Kennedy fired all the incumbent members of the vaccine advisory panel, known as ACIP, and appointed new members, including several who, like him, oppose some vaccines. The panel's recommendations soon changed drastically.   \n   Last month, the CDC removed its universal recommendations for children to receive seven immunizations: those protecting against respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease, flu, COVID-19, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and rotavirus. The move followed a memorandum from the White House calling on the CDC to cull the schedule.   Now, those vaccines, which researchers estimate have prevented thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses, are recommended by the CDC only for children at high risk of serious illness or after consultation between doctors and parents.   In response to questions about Kennedy's actions on vaccines over the past year, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the secretary \"continues to follow through on his commitments\" to Cassidy.   \"As part of those commitments, HHS accepted Chairman Cassidy's numerous recommendations for key roles at the agency, retained particular language on the CDC website, and adopted ACIP recommendations,\" Nixon added. \"Secretary Kennedy talks to the chairman at a regular clip.\"   Cassidy and his office have repeatedly rebuffed questions about whether Kennedy, since becoming secretary, has broken the commitments he made to the senator.   Vaccine funding axed   Weeks after Kennedy took over the federal health department, the CDC pulled back $11 billion in COVID-era grants that local health departments were using to fund vaccination programs, among other initiatives.   That happened after Kennedy pledged during his confirmation hearings not to undermine vaccine funding. Kennedy replied, \"Yes\" when Cassidy asked him directly: \"Do you commit that you will not work to impound, divert, or otherwise reduce any funding appropriated by Congress for the purpose of vaccination programs?\"   A federal judge later ordered HHS to distribute the money.   The National Institutes of Health, part of HHS, also yanked dozens of research grants supporting studies of vaccine hesitancy last year. Kennedy, meanwhile, ordered the cancellation of a half-billion dollars' worth of mRNA vaccine research in August.   \n   A discredited theory about autism   Cassidy said in his floor speech that he received a guarantee from Kennedy that the CDC's website would not remove statements explaining that vaccines do not cause autism.   Technically, Kennedy kept his promise not to remove the statements. The website still says that vaccines do not cause autism.   But late last year, new statements sprang up on the same webpage, baselessly casting doubt on vaccine safety. \"The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism,\" the page on autism now misleadingly reads.   The webpage also states that the public has largely ignored studies showing that vaccines do cause autism. That is false. Over decades of research, scientific studies have repeatedly concluded that there is no link between vaccines and autism.   A controversial 1998 study that captured global attention did link the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. It was retracted for being fraudulent — though not until a decade after it was published, during which there were sharp declines in U.S. vaccination rates.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona about the fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego was in that hearing and also voted against DHS funding at this time. Senators then left town, so we can expect a partial shutdown tonight. Senator Gallego is at the Munich Security Conference. Welcome to the program.RUBEN GALLEGO: Thanks for having me.INSKEEP: What happens tonight to the Coast Guard, to the TSA at the airports, the cybersecurity agency, among other things?GALLEGO: Nothing right now. Many are still fully funded for a couple weeks, and they'll continue doing their work. And in the meantime, we're going to continue trying to find a solution.INSKEEP: Are you saying, then, that missing this deadline is effectively no big deal?GALLEGO: Everything is a big deal when you're dealing with uncertainty of funding. But, you know, the one thing that we can't do is to rush to fund a government entity such as ICE and Border Patrol that killed two Americans in 2 1/2 weeks. So we have to do this right, and we have to make sure that, you know, we're doing it in the best interests of this country.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk that through. This is, of course, a debate over restrictions on immigration agents. There's been a lot of criticism of immigration agents in Minnesota. At the same time, you're in a state, Arizona, where I've talked with voters. People do want immigration enforcement, border enforcement. Do you think that voters are going to sustain you on this issue as you head into the fall elections?GALLEGO: Yes, because voters, I think, understand the nuanced position that they want. They want border security. They want immigration enforcement. They want professional immigration enforcement. That's not what they're seeing right now. That's not what they're seeing in Los Angeles. That's not what they saw in Minnesota. It's not what they're seeing all the time on TV, where you have ICE agents, border agents, Border Patrol agents acting in a manner that is, you know, unprofessional. You know, people are used to trained, professional law enforcement in their towns, and what they're seeing is quite the opposite. And I think that's why you're seeing people that are, you know, still in the position that they want immigration enforcement but not liking the type of action they're seeing within our cities.INSKEEP: As I understand it, you're not saying to abolish ICE, but you're calling to tear it down. What do you mean?GALLEGO: Well, it's pretty simple. You know, at the core, ICE is absolutely rotten right now. It is being run by Stephen Miller, and he is, you know, basically putting some of the worst elements into ICE. And so what does that look like? You know, you're hiring a lot of people that are not properly trained for a mission that is very sensitive. You're hiring more people than the mission requires. You're having them have more rights than most law enforcement has ever needed, such as being able to avoid warrants, being able to detain Americans. You know, they're about to create about eight to 10 massive warehouses to house, you know, tens of thousands of humans in one spot one day. When this period is done with Donald Trump, we can't have that same type of setup.You know, we're always going to have an immigration enforcement force. Every country has an immigration enforcement force. But it has to be rightsized to the mission that we want that, you know, respects human rights, that is also, you know, really geared to where the country wants to go when it comes to immigration enforcement. That's professional immigration...INSKEEP: Yeah.GALLEGO: ...Enforcement and border control, not the suppression that we're seeing in cities right now.INSKEEP: Senator, I want to ask about another issue here because you represent the state of Arizona, where Nancy Guthrie was apparently kidnapped. We've been following that disappearance, of course - Savannah Guthrie's mom. We've seen doorbell camera video of an armed man on her porch. I'd like to know, are you in touch with the family here or with authorities, and what are you hearing?GALLEGO: We're in touch with authorities. You know, obviously, this is a horrible situation. We pray for the safe return of the Guthrie mother. And, you know, it is just shocking, obviously, to our community down in Tucson. It's a safe community. It is a community that really does take care of each other. And I really hope that, you know, we have a solution there. And it is my goal to make sure that the federal government is doing everything it can to make sure - and using every leverage they can and every technology they can to make sure that she gets home safely.INSKEEP: Fox News is alleging, reporting, that the FBI is having a conflict with local authorities over sharing evidence and who gets what part of the investigation. Do you have any understanding of that?GALLEGO: I don't, but I really hope - yeah, I really don't. But I hope that there is an understanding that this is not the time for turf wars. It's time for - to be professional, share information. And the goal is obviously to get, you know, her safe and to hold the men or women accountable for what they did.INSKEEP: Senator Ruben Gallego is a Democrat from Arizona. Thanks for your time.GALLEGO: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Rubio addressed the conference a year after Vice President JD Vance stunned the same audience with a harsh critique of European values. A series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies followed, including Trump's short-lived threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a bid to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.   \n   On Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz opened this year's gathering by calling for the United States and Europe to \"repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together,\" saying that even the U.S. isn't powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order no longer exists. He made clear that Europe will stand by its approach to free speech and climate change, and rejects a \"culture war\" and protectionism.   Rubio argued that the \"euphoria\" of the Western victory in the Cold War led to a \"dangerous delusion that we had entered 'the end of history,' that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood ... and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.\"   \"We made these mistakes together and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,\" Rubio said. He said that, under Trump, the U.S. \"will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration.\"   \"This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,\" he said. \"This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.\"   \n   \"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the trans-Atlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish,\" Rubio said. \"Because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.\"   \n   \"We have fought against each other, then reconciled, then fought and reconciled again. And we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar,\" Rubio said. \"And I'm here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity. and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.\"   Rubio said that the United Nations \"still has tremendous potential\" but that, on today's most pressing matters, \"it has no answers and has played virtually no role.\"   Speaking directly after Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi offered a contrasting view.   \"The main reason for the inadequacy of the current international system is not the United Nations itself, but the fact that some countries magnify differences, pursue national priorities ... and even revive the Cold War mentality,\" he argued. \"All these have undermined the basis of trust, worsened the atmosphere of cooperation, and made the operation of international mechanisms difficult.\"\n",

And after a lot of back and forth with the White House over the invite list, governors from both parties are invited to attend the traditional meeting at the White House with the president. But the chaos leading up to the meetings underscores Trump's history of unraveling Democratic norms and political relationships. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram brings us the story.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: The annual governors' meeting at the White House used to be a run-of-the-mill event, like the winners of the World Series or the Super Bowl meeting with the president. That's according to Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at UC San Diego.THAD KOUSSER: It used to be just something that everyone would do, and it had no political content. It was part of the ceremonial head-of-state aspects of American politics. That has changed as presidents on both sides of the aisle have become so polarizing.SHIVARAM: Kousser says governors and the president have historically shared a somewhat amiable relationship. Governors have needed help from the president and the federal government in handling crises like natural disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic. And presidents have needed governors to help drum up support for their agenda.But under Trump, relationships have become increasingly tense with governors of blue states. The administration has been drafting plans to withhold federal public health funding to states like Illinois and Colorado. Trump has lashed out at Democratic governors of Minnesota Tim Walz and California's Gavin Newsom over immigration, National Guard troops and federal agents in their states and aid for natural disasters. At last year's gathering of governors at the White House, Trump went after Maine governor Janet Mills for her state's support of trans athletes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You'd better comply because otherwise, you're not getting any federal funding.JANET MILLS: I'll see you in court.TRUMP: Every state - good. I'll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.SHIVARAM: Trump's attacks have shined a spotlight onto certain Democrats, and in some ways, it's boosted their careers. Mills is now running for a Senate seat in Maine, challenging Republican Susan Collins. Newsom and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have signaled their intention to run for president in 2028. Kousser says it's all part of the delicate dance governors from the opposing party of the president are playing.KOUSSER: Governors and presidents need each other to advance their policies, but they also can score political points by attacking each other.SHIVARAM: Trump has gone after governors in his own party, too. He was critical of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp after Kemp refused to alter the 2020 election outcome in favor of Trump. And this week, he attacked Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, who leads the bipartisan Governors Association. Stitt stood up for the bipartisan nature of the gathering at the White House, though Stitt is term-limited, so he can't run for governor again. Still, Kousser says Stitt and the Governors Association offered an important show of unity.KOUSSER: What we're seeing here is a really impressive case of governors banding together to protect this institution - this job that they all have and love.SHIVARAM: Though the unity might only go so far. Trump has still not invited two Democrats - Maryland's Wes Moore and Colorado's Jared Polis - to the White House for a formal dinner. And both Newsom and Moore say they're not attending the meeting with Trump at all.Deepa Shivaram, NPR News, the White House.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      A stopgap bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security expires Friday night. DHS could be without funding for days, as the House and Senate are expected to be in recess next week.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires at the end of the day.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The Senate failed on Thursday to advance a spending bill that would have funded DHS through the end of September. Democrats have vowed not to support any bill without major changes to immigration enforcement. Here's Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: Today's strong vote was a shot across the bow to Republicans. Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos.INSKEEP: In a moment, we speak with Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego. First, the facts.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt joins us to talk through all this. Good morning, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: So is this one of those days where the clock is ticking down to a shutdown and then there's a last-minute deal?SPRUNT: You know, I don't think so this time. Both sides seem pretty far apart still. Some Democratic demands do have bipartisan support, like requiring body cameras for officers. But there are other proposals that Republicans have pushed back on, like having officers remove their masks. So I think it's going to be a holding pattern while both parties keep negotiating.FADEL: OK. So a shutdown, though, doesn't mean there won't be money for ICE, right?SPRUNT: That's right. A shutdown here does not mean a shutdown of ICE. And that's because the agency got over $70 billion in separate funds from Congress over the summer as part of Republicans' massive spending and tax bill. So other agencies within the DHS will be affected by a shutdown, like TSA and FEMA.FADEL: Now, we saw top officials from ICE and Customs and Border Protection testifying before the Senate yesterday. But Kristi Noem, the head of DHS, wasn't there, right?SPRUNT: That's right, and her absence was mentioned a few times. Several senators said they want her to testify before the Homeland Security Committee. She's actually set to testify before a different committee come March. And you might remember that almost immediately after officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, Noem described him as a domestic terrorist, and she later said that she got that information from Border Patrol agents on the ground. But yesterday, CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott told the committee he never described Pretti as a terrorist, nor was he aware of anyone in his agency saying that. And he said he couldn't speculate as to why she would say that.FADEL: Interesting. So he's directly contradicting what Noem said. What else stood out to you in the hearing?SPRUNT: Well, we learned some important numbers. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said that there's been more than three dozen internal investigations into allegations of excessive use of force by its agents in the last year. Eighteen have been closed, 19 pending and one referred for further action, although he didn't say which incident that was. And another thing that stood out to me, you know, senators spent a lot of time trying to clarify the use-of-force policies - how officers are trained in de-escalation. And committee Chairman Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, played a video of Pretti and officers. And he paused the video several times, stopping to show officers pushing a nearby woman to the ground, spraying Pretti in the face, surrounding him.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAND PAUL: I see nothing here, I mean, not even a hint of something that was aggressive on his part. Everything was retreat. He's over in the street. He retreats. He retreats. The woman is pushed to the ground. He tries to assist the woman to get up. He's violently sprayed, and it just continues.SPRUNT: Now, the officials, in response, wouldn't give specifics about this. They said it's an ongoing investigation. They said the body camera footage would eventually be released. But Paul made a point of saying that ICE and CBP have to admit their mistakes in order to restore the public's trust.FADEL: That's NPR's Barbara Sprunt. Thank you, Barbara.SPRUNT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The agents have been placed on administrative leave after \"a joint review by ICE and the Department of Justice of video evidence has revealed that sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements,\" the spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said.   The rare acknowledgment of potential missteps by ICE agents comes after the agency's acting director, Todd Lyons, told Congress on Thursday that ICE has conducted 37 investigations into officers' use of force over the past year. He didn't say whether anyone has been fired.   \n   McLaughlin said the agency is investigating the January 14 shooting of the Venezuelan immigrant, and the officers involved could be fired or criminally prosecuted for any violations.   \"The men and women of ICE are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and are held to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical conduct,\" McLaughlin said in Friday's statement. \"Violations of this sacred sworn oath will not be tolerated.\"   DHS initially said the officer fired a shot to \"save his life\" after being \"ambushed and attacked\" by three immigrants with a snow shovel and a broom handle during a \"targeted traffic stop.\"   Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, the subject of the traffic stop, was injured after getting shot in the leg. Another Venezuelan man, Alfredo Aljorna, was also accused of attacking the officers.   \n   However, Minnesota U.S. Attorney Dan Rosen on Thursday dropped the charges against them.   McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether the agency stands by its initial statement describing the agent's behavior during the incident as self-defense.   Since the beginning, eyewitness accounts contradicted the statements made by DHS related to the shooting of Sosa-Celis.   His partner, Indriany Mendoza Camacho, told Minnesota Public Radio last week she was present the night of the shooting, and that Sosa-Celis was trying to separate the agent and the other Venezuelan man so both the immigrants could get into a house.   \n   \"I'm a witness, I saw everything, and my partner never grabbed anything to hit him or anything like that,\" she said.   \n   The shooting happened during Operation Metro Surge, an aggressive immigration crackdown that brought about 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota starting in December.   The Trump administration on Thursday announced it was ending Operation Metro Surge. The operation led to more than 4,000 arrests of undocumented immigrants, according to White House border czar Tom Homan, and the killing of two U.S. citizens, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti.   Those shootings are also being investigated by federal authorities.   An internal preliminary review conducted by Customs and Border Protection into Pretti's death also contradicted the Trump administration's initial narrative about his shooting.\n",

The department saw its baseline funding expire after lawmakers left town for a week-long recess, but without a deal to rein in the conduct of federal immigration officers. Democrats say that after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by immigration officers in Minneapolis, they need reforms cemented into law before agreeing to fund the department.   The shutdown is now the third in a matter of months, but unlike the others, this one is more limited. It only affects DHS, not other federal agencies. Still, the department is sweeping in its scope, responsible not only for immigration enforcement, but also disaster response and airport security.   \n   As lawmakers and the White House look to break the impasse, here are five things to know about the shutdown.   1. It's hard to know how long the shutdown will last    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., arrives for a press conference on February 10, 2026 on Capitol Hill. Thune has said lawmakers have been told to be ready to return from recess if a deal on DHS funding is reached.\n                \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats have spelled out a list of 10 demands, but finding consensus has been tough. Some asks, like requiring immigration officers to wear body cameras, appear to enjoy bipartisan support. But GOP lawmakers have pushed back on other demands, like prohibiting agents from wearing masks to conceal their identities. Republicans say doing so would make it easier for people to doxx federal officers.    Republicans in the Senate tried to pass a short-term funding extension on Thursday to allow time for negotiations to play out, but Democrats blocked that measure before lawmakers in both chambers left the Capitol for the recess. The vote came after a White House counteroffer that Democrats rejected as \"insufficient and incomplete.\"    \"Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"This vote today asked a simple question: Will you rein in ICE's abuses or will you vote to extend the chaos. Republicans chose chaos. The Democrats, we refused.\"   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said lawmakers have been told to be ready to return from recess if a deal is reached, though he indicated that would be unlikely.   \n   \"I just think at the moment we're not close,\" Thune told reporters.   2. Immigration enforcement is likely to continue uninterrupted    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An ICE agent holds a taser as they stand watch on February 5, 2026 in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   During two congressional hearings this week, the leaders of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection told lawmakers their agencies would likely not see significant impact on their enforcement operations since both agencies received more than $70 billion from Congress last summer as part of the GOP's massive tax and spending bill.   ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said the shutdown could affect DHS's work on transnational crime, but he did not note any impact to immigration operations. CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott didn't detail how the shutdown would affect personnel, just saying: \"I agree America becomes less safe.\"   Another agency unlikely to see much interruption is U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow reminded House lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   3. Air travelers could see delays ... eventually    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A TSA checkpoint is closed during last year's government shutdown at Baltimore Washington International Airport. The shutdown at DHS could lead to delays for travelers at TSA checkpoints.\n                \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most of the Transportation Security Administration's roughly 64,000 employees are considered \"essential\" workers and have to stay on the job.   Still, travelers across the U.S. could feel the impact of the shutdown — particularly if it lasts more than a few weeks. In past shutdowns, airport security workers stayed home from work in greater numbers when they started missing paychecks, citing \"financial limitations.\"   And TSA leaders say many are still feeling the effects of the lengthy funding lapse in October and November.   \"We saw a lot of folks have to take on second jobs, making for extremely long work days,\" said Ha Nguyen McNeill, the acting administrator of the TSA, at a House hearing on Wednesday. \"Some are just recovering from the financial impact of the 43-day shutdown. Many are still reeling from it. We cannot put them through another such experience.\"   \n   The number of unscheduled absences among TSA workers doubled or even tripled at some airports during the last shutdown, according to McNeill. The threat of repeated shutdowns also makes it harder to attract and retain workers, she said.   Some may feel more motivated to show up for work this time because of the $10,000 bonuses that DHS leaders gave screeners for \"exemplary service\" after the previous finding lapse — though it remains unclear exactly how many workers received those bonuses, or how they were selected.   Fortunately for travelers, February is a relatively quiet month for the U.S. aviation industry. But traffic tends to pick up in March, when the spring break travel season begins. Air traffic controllers work for the Federal Aviation Administration, which is not part of DHS, so they should not be directly affected by a shutdown.   4. Federal disaster response will still be available, but may be slowed down    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A worker in the National Response Coordination Center looks at a map of the approaching winter storm at FEMA headquarters on January 24, 2026 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The country's top disaster recovery agency will be affected by the shutdown, but the agency will still be able to respond to emergencies.   FEMA supports state and local governments when large disasters happen, including major hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires. For example, FEMA had staff, food and generators available during the ice storm that hit the eastern half of the U.S. earlier this winter.   That type of assistance is paid for with money from the Disaster Relief Fund, which was established by Congress. On Wednesday, FEMA Associate Administrator Gregg Phillips told Congress that the fund \"has sufficient balances to continue emergency response activities for the foreseeable future.\"   FEMA also helps pay for the costs of disaster recovery, including repairs to homes, schools and roads, hauling away debris and building infrastructure such as flood walls that can help protect people during the next disaster. That work often takes years, and it will be slowed down by the shutdown because some employees may be furloughed, and some types of funding will not be available.   \n   \"A government shutdown would severely disrupt FEMA's ability to reimburse states for disaster relief costs and to support our recovery from disasters,\" Phillips told House members.   5. Some Coast Guard missions may end up suspended    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617) is docked at Coast Guard Base San Juan, on December 31, 2025 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n                \n                    Miguel J.

Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the military, but is housed inside DHS. Admiral Thomas Allan told the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday that during a shutdown the Coast Guard would have to suspend all non-essential missions, and defer training and maintenance, along with commercial safety inspections and other services.    Coast Guard teams are deployed around the country and around the world and perform a wide range of missions that are considered essential, from search and rescue to interdicting drug vessels. Many of the 55,000 personnel would have to continue working, while risking not being paid during a shutdown. Though during the last shutdown, DHS used money from the Republican tax and spending bill to pay their salaries. \n",

Members of the Trump administration testified before Congress, as did Epstein's convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. Members of Congress are still seeking answers on the Justice Department's redactions in the files and the investigation overall. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom continues with its own reckoning.   The massive tranche of documents — including emails, photos and other documents — are materials collected during the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell. Many of the documents include unverified claims and little if any context. Congress passed a law mandating their release, and lawmakers are now combing through them seeking further accountability for the victims.    \n   Here is a round of up of the top political news related to the Epstein files this week:   Maxwell testimony    Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20-years in prison for a child sex trafficking scheme with Epstein, appeared by video for a deposition in front of the House Oversight Committee on Monday. Republicans and Democrats sought answers to a myriad of questions, including who were the other co-conspirators involved in the sex trafficking ring and which men sexually abused girls.   \n   But lawmakers weren't able to get much of anything out of Maxwell. She refused to testify and invoked her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination. Instead, her lawyer, David Oscar Markus, read a prepared statement to the committee. Maxwell, he said, is \"prepared to speak fully and honestly\" but only if granted clemency by President Trump.   \"Only she can provide a complete account. And some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters. For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to hear that explanation,\" Markus said.   When asked during a press briefing on Tuesday if Trump would consider pardoning Maxwell, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it's not something she has discussed with the president recently because \"frankly, it is not a priority.\"   \n   \"Last time we did speak about it, he said it's not something he's considering or thinking about,\" she told reporters.   \n   After the hearing, committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., said he was disappointed in Maxwell's lack of testimony but that the committee's investigation will continue.   \"I personally don't think she should be granted any type of immunity or clemency,\" he said of Maxwell.   Six names uncovered    The two lawmakers that spearheaded The Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law that forced the public release of the documents related to the investigation and death of Epstein, are still arguing that the Department of Justice isn't abiding by the law. Among their top concerns is how the DOJ has handled redactions in the documents, including redacting names that they say should have been made public under the law and in other instances exposing the names of victims.   Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., reviewed an unredacted version of the files on Monday at the Justice Department, which is available to lawmakers for the first time. After searching the files, Khanna and Massie said they uncovered the names of six men in the files that were wrongly redacted. The lawmakers accused the DOJ of covering up the identities of the men and scrubbing the files ahead of the release.    \n   Khanna said on the House floor that 70% to 80% of the files are still redacted and announced the redacted names. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on X that the move \"forced the unmasking\" of people \"who have NOTHING to do with Epstein or Maxwell.\" He added that four of the six appeared in just one document.   \"The two other men — Les Wexner and Sultan bin Sulayem — were unredacted in the one document, and are referenced in the files nearly two hundred times and over 4,700 times respectively,\" Blanche said.   \n   On Friday, Dubai Ports World announced Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem resigned from the company effective immediately.   During a tele-townhall with Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday, Massie said Wexner, a billionaire businessman, should be forced to answer questions about his relationship with Epstein.   In January, House Oversight ranking member Robert Garcia, D-Calif., announced a subpoena for Wexner to testify. Wexner is set to be deposed by lawmakers in Ohio, where he lives, on Feb. 18. A spokesperson for Wexner told NPR member station WOSU that Wexner fully cooperated with federal investigators by providing background information on Epstein and was not contacted again.   Lutnick and Bondi testify and lawmaker surveillance    Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose name also appears in the files, answered questions about his relationship with Epstein from members of a Senate committee on Tuesday during an unrelated oversight hearing. Lutinck previously said he cut ties with Epstein before the financier was charged with any sex crimes in 2006.   But the latest batch of files contained an email correspondence between Epstein and Lutnick in 2012, where Lutnick planned a trip to Epstein's island. Lutnick admitted to the committee that his family visited Epstein while on vacation.   \"We had lunch on the island — that is true — for an hour, and we left with all of my children, with my nannies and my wife all together. We were on family vacation,\" Lutnick said. He added, \"I don't recall why we did it.\"   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   When Trump was asked by reporters on Thursday about Lutnick's visit to the island, Trump said he \"wasn't aware\" of it and that he hasn't spoken with Lutnick about it.   \"I was never there. Somebody will someday say that I was never there,\" Trump added.   Despite Lutnick's connection to Epstein, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier in the week that Lutnick \"remains a very important member of President Trump's team, and the president fully supports the secretary.\"   \n   U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also testified before Congress on Wednesday at a heated DOJ oversight hearing, during which she repeatedly dodged questions related to the Epstein files and insulted lawmakers who questioned her about them.   In one instance, Massie pressed Bondi on why some names, including Wexner's, were redacted. Bondi defended the DOJ's work and retorted that Massie suffered from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" and was \"a failed politician.\"    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   Lawmakers later accused Bondi of \"spying\" on their searches of the unredacted documents in the DOJ's secure terminals. After the hearing concluded, a photo emerged of Bondi holding the search history of Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., with whom Bondi also verbally sparred.    \"Members of Congress should be able to conduct oversight without the Department of Justice spying on us. It's outrageous and has to stop,\" Jayapal said on X.   \n   U.K. fallout   Top leaders in the United Kingdom are also facing backlash as a result of the Epstein files.   U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced calls to resign this week over a relationship his appointed U.S. ambassador, Peter Mandelson, had with Epstein. The latest batch of files show Mandelson may have shared sensitive U.K. government information with Epstein.   \n   Mandelson resigned last year after the files showed he remained in contact with Epstein after Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution in Florida, but Starmer faces pressure and criticism for appointing Mandelson to begin with. Starmer admitted he knew Mandelson had a relationship with Epstein prior to appointing him as U.S. ambassador but said Mandelson lied to him about the extent of their relationship.   Two members of Starmer's cabinet, chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney and communications director Tim Allan, resigned this week as opposition parties urged Starmer to step down.   \n   The Epstein files continue to rope in the royal family, too. U.K. police are looking into whether former Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his title, also leaked private government information to Epstein.\n",

It would not be the first time recently that lawmakers pledged to find consensus only for negotiations to fall apart.   A month ago, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, was projecting confidence that a bipartisan group of lawmakers was nearing a deal to restore lapsed health insurance subsidies.   The enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired at the end of last year, despite a majority of Americans in favor of Congress renewing them, according to polling from the nonprofit KFF.   \n   \"We're in the red zone,\" Moreno told reporters. \"But that does not mean a touchdown. It could mean a 95-yard fumble.\"   In the end, there was no touchdown. Moreno told NPR last week that the talks fizzled. He blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for shutting them down in order to keep pummeling Republicans over premium costs.   \"Shouldn't we be here trying to figure out how to solve problems rather than trying to score political points for the purposes of the next election?\" Moreno asked.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, speaks to members of the media at the U.S. Capitol on January 13, 2026. Until recently, Moreno was projecting confidence that a deal to restore lapsed health insurance subsidies was in reach.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats dispute that characterization, saying Republicans blew up the effort by inserting anti-abortion language in a provision on health savings accounts.   Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., says the effort was doomed to fail — not because of a lack of compromise but because Democrats lost leverage when a few voted to end the shutdown last fall.   \"I was pretty confident the minute we gave up that we weren't going to get it,\" Murphy said.   A bipartisan agreement to address ICE tactics has yet to materialize    Congress' ability to act is again being tested, this time by the aggressive actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents in Minnesota and elsewhere.   As with the subsidies, public outcry pushed a number of Republicans and Democrats to pledge to do something — in this case, reining in enforcement tactics. Top lawmakers initially signaled optimism that they could find common ground on topics such as requiring that officers wear body cameras.   \n   But within days, that rosiness dissipated. Now Democrats are again threatening to withhold their votes for the measure, risking a shutdown of the department after Friday, unless Republican lawmakers and the White House agree to the reforms they want.   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly blamed Democrats, saying they imposed an unrealistic timeline and then dawdled before producing a laundry list of nonstarters, like banning agents from wearing masks or requiring judicial warrants for enforcement operations in homes.   Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the White House's initial response to their demands insufficient and continue to insist that their proposals are reasonable and targeted.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, enters the U.S. Capitol on January 27, 2026. Collins has been a key negotiator in government funding talks, and says the passage of appropriations bills is evidence that Congress can still do hard things.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Asked why bipartisan negotiations keep crumbling, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., who has participated in negotiations on the subsidies and immigration, said Congress does successfully collaborate, like negotiating and passing bipartisan government funding bills worth more than $1 trillion.   \"I don't know how you could possibly describe that as crumbling,\" Collins told NPR. \"That's Congress reasserting its power of the purse.\"   Little incentive to compromise   Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat who represented North Dakota in the Senate from 2013 through 2018, spent hours in rooms with centrist senators like Collins trying to resolve a standoff over the debt ceiling.   She says bipartisan negotiations have always been a high-wire act, particularly amid a national crisis.   \"When the shock wears off, then all of a sudden everyone goes back to their corners,\" Heitkamp said.   A gang of eight lawmakers tried, but failed, to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Tim Scott, R-S.C., made progress on policing reform after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, but came up empty-handed.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A gang of eight lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tried but failed, to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. Above, from left in the gang of eight were, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Graham, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.\n                \n                    J.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Heitkamp, who until recently directed the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics, says many lawmakers today see even less incentive to compromise as politics becomes more tribal.   \n   \"The base on both sides, their willingness to reward compromise is greatly diminished,\" she said. \"If you look at the Senate of old, there were a lot of egos in that room and a lot of people who made up their own minds, and now what you have is people who are willing to be cogs in the wheel.\"   How inaction diminishes public trust   When Congress promises to act and does not, Heitkamp says, that erodes public trust in the institution's ability to respond to problems.   Sixty-six percent of Americans report having not very much or no trust in Congress, according to a September Gallup survey.   Of the 14 Arizona swing voters who participated in a Feb. 10 online focus group organized by NPR and the Swing Voter Project, only two said they had confidence that Congress would take any action on the immigration-related proposals being discussed.   Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., says she is thinking about public trust as she helps lead the current negotiations on immigration enforcement.   \"Anybody can identify a problem,\" Britt said in an interview. \"We have to be people that are looking for solutions. Treating people with dignity and respect allows you to have tough conversations. I think we owe it to the people we serve to actually find that pathway forward.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., right, speaks with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,  during an oversight hearing on May 8, 2025. Britt and Murphy have been key negotiators for their parties in talks around DHS funding.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Britt panned Democrats' initial demands last week as a Christmas list, though talks are ongoing and, unlike the fight over the health subsidies, the White House is involved and negotiating directly with Democrats.   Last fall, Britt helped strike a deal with those handful of Democrats who voted to end the 43-day shutdown — including Sen. Tim Kaine.   Kaine, D-Va., says bipartisan action is still possible, but the reality is that on the most fraught issues, it is extremely difficult.   \"On health care, on immigration, the parties are in fundamentally very different places,\" he said. \"And so that means I go into any negotiation on a topic like this: high hopes, low expectations.\"\n",

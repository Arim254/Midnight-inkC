    "body": "\n      Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of America's biggest city.  But voters who elected him say the hopeful tone and big ideas of Mamdani's campaign could resonate beyond New York City.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Zohran Mamdani's supporters are celebrating his history-making win as the next mayor of New York City. Many say they believe he can make the city more affordable and fair. But they also hope that Mamdani's progressive policy ideas and the upbeat tone of his campaign will shape American politics beyond New York City. NPR's Brian Mann reports.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: When Mamdani took the stage at his victory celebration in Brooklyn, he flashed his trademark grin, then quoted American socialist Eugene Debs.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity.(CHEERING)MANN: Mamdani, himself a Democratic socialist, hadn't just won. In unofficial returns, he topped 50% in a three-way race, beating Republican Curtis Sliwa and independent Andrew Cuomo, once a Democratic titan in New York politics.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty.(CHEERING)MANN: Mamdani will take the helm of America's biggest city, having made big promises - free bus service, free early child care, more affordable groceries and frozen rents on some apartments. But on the night of his victory, many Mamdani supporters said it was the tone of the campaign not the details that moved them. Ameer Al is 27, a Palestinian American.AMEER AL: I feel like there has been this darkness that's been, like, casted over New York City the last few years, and I'm really, really thrilled to see someone like a breath of fresh air like Zohran.MANN: Mamdani will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, and his criticism of Israel over the war in Gaza and his support for Palestinian rights became major flashpoints in this campaign. More than a thousand American rabbis signed a letter critical of his positions. A voter poll by the Associated Press on Tuesday found only about a third of the city's Jewish residents voted for Mamdani. But Ira Mont, who's 63 and describes himself as a Jewish Brooklynite, said he decided Mamdani was the hopeful choice.IRA MONT: Zohran is stepping into a very big show, but he is very clearly going to surround himself with the right people. He intends to be the mayor for everyone who lives here.MANN: Mamdani's main rival in this election, Andrew Cuomo, who's 67, ran as an independent after losing the Democratic primary. He positioned himself as the pro-business, law and order candidate, arguing Mamdani would heighten antisemitism and make New Yorkers less safe. In his concession speech, Cuomo stuck to that ominous narrative.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: We are heading down a dangerous, dangerous road.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah.MANN: But many voters here said they were turned off by the dark tone of Cuomo's campaign, and by the sexual harassment scandal involving more than a dozen women that forced Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021. Bertha Lewis, who's 74 and African American, said she also just wants new, younger leadership in the Democratic Party.BERTHA LEWIS: Now is another generation. And clinging to power, which is a drug, as we have found out, is not good.MANN: In his victory speech, Mamdani described his election as proof that ambitious policy ideas and optimism can win elections.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light.(CHEERING)MANN: Mamdani enters City Hall in January with no previous executive experience, and he has a huge lift ahead, delivering on his costly promises. He'll face deep distrust from many of the city's business leaders, deep concern among leaders in the largest Jewish community outside Israel and even skepticism within the Democratic Party. New York Senator Chuck Schumer declined to say whether he voted for Mamdani or Cuomo. But Mamdani's biggest challenge may be President Trump, who has threatened to cut off federal aid to the city. Mamdani spoke directly to Trump last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: Since I know you're watching...(CHEERING)MAMDANI: ...I have four words for you. Turn the volume up.(CHEERING)MANN: This moment of celebration and defiance will quickly give way to the gritty, complicated business of governing. Mamdani announced his transition team this morning, made up of experienced former city and federal officials, all of them women. Brian Mann, NPR News, Brooklyn, New York.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      California voted to approve Prop 50, a measure to change election maps. Rep. Kevin Kiley, whose district will be impacted by the new map, has introduced legislation banning mid-decade gerrymandering.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Juana Summers in Washington.AILSA CHANG, HOST:  And I'm Ailsa Chang in Culver City, California. And voters here in California have approved Prop 50. The measure allows this state to redraw its congressional map. The new map could mean as many as five new seats for Democrats after next year's midterm elections. Governor Gavin Newsom says the measure is a direct response to gerrymandering efforts in Republican-led states like Texas. But critics, like Republican Kevin Kiley of California, strongly oppose Prop 50. Congressman Kiley joins us now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.KEVIN KILEY: Thanks for having me.CHANG: Thanks for being with us. OK. So you have been very vocal about your opposition to Prop 50. Your seat is one of the seats targeted by this new map. But you have introduced a bill to ban all mid-decade redistricting nationwide, right? So let me make sure I'm clear. You oppose redistricting efforts by your own party, as well - efforts that President Trump has pushed for?KILEY: That's correct. I don't care if it's a Republican state, a Democrat state. I think gerrymandering is wrong. So I opposed it in California. I oppose it in Texas. And ultimately, the passage of Prop 50, I think we should take as a call to action to get rid of gerrymandering nationwide and establish independent redistricting across the country.CHANG: And you think gerrymandering should end altogether or just mid-decade gerrymandering?KILEY: Well, so the bill that I've introduced seeks to sort of address this new phenomenon of mid-decade redistricting, which I think is especially pernicious. But ultimately, by the time of the next census, when we're actually supposed to do regular redistricting, I'd like to see a solution for gerrymandering, you know, across the country, as well.CHANG: But there was a bill put forward back in 2021 - right? - that was led by Democrats. It would have banned gerrymandering altogether, and no Republican senators voted for it. So how do you get more of your Republican colleagues on board with your position on gerrymandering?KILEY: You know, I think more people are recognizing the extent of the problem, for no other reason than we're seeing lots of states that are now having, you know, their district maps totally upended. I think the bill you're referring to had a lot of other things in it. But what I'd like to see and what I'm actually working on now is something that is specifically tailored at just setting up something like an independent commission, like we had in California, in all 50 states. And actually, a silver lining of Prop 50 is that in addition to bringing back gerrymandering in California, what it also did was adopt a state policy in California of supporting independent redistricting nationwide. So I certainly intend to act upon that call to action from the voters.CHANG: OK. Well, for now, at least, Prop 50 is the political reality in this state, in California. So that means the path to your reelection will probably be a lot more difficult. How do you see, or do you even see a viable path for your political survival?KILEY: I do see a viable path. I - of course, I'm not happy that my beautiful district, I think the most beautiful district in California, is now going to be chopped into six different pieces. But, you know, kind of the fundamental flaw with gerrymandering is that it presupposes that politicians can dictate election outcomes simply by moving lines around on the map. But at the end of the day, the power still rests with voters to choose their representatives. And I think people, you know, they look beyond the party label. They look at the person.And I was fortunate in my last reelection to actually get the second most crossover votes of any competitive race in the country, meaning that people that voted for Kamala Harris for president but voted for me for representative. And that's because I focused on issues that don't have a particularly partisan valence but are simply about improving the quality of life for the folks that I represent.CHANG: I want to turn now, briefly, to the government shutdown. You have also criticized your own party for keeping the House out of session during the shutdown. You've pointed to partisanship being one of the things preventing the reopening of the government. So let me just ask you, how do you suggest all of you end this game of chicken that we've been seeing for so many days right now?KILEY: Yeah. So having the House in session would be a start. I think it's totally unacceptable that the Republican leadership has decided to cancel sessions of the U.S. House of Representatives for six straight weeks. It's meant that all of our ordinary business has been shut down, in addition to meaning that we don't have a lot of relevance on the House side in getting us out of this mess. We are starting to see some encouraging signs of life. I've been having discussions with people on both sides of the aisle about addressing this health care issue, of the cliff for these subsidies that will make health care a lot more expensive for a lot of people. My colleague in California from across the aisle, Sam Liccardo, and I have just released a framework on that issue.So I think that these sort of conversations on the Senate side, as well, are starting to lead somewhere. But it is just so unacceptable that we have had a government shutdown for 36 days now. And I think that these two episodes - the redistricting war and the government shutdown - really underline the extent to which excessive partisanship is one of the biggest challenges facing the country. And, you know, that's what I pledged to overcome when I first ran, and I think that's more important than ever now.CHANG: Well, speaking of partisanship, when you look at the big wins that Democrats did have last night, undeniably, how concerned are you that that result might reflect that President Trump and his policies are just not all that popular right now?KILEY: Well, you know, everyone's going to attach whatever meaning they will to election results on a given night. You know...CHANG: What do you attach to it?KILEY: I think that, from my perspective in California, it's that the country is very divided right now, and people are just very frustrated with Congress in general, with Washington in general. I saw a poll showing that Congress has a 13% approval rating. And honestly, with this government shutdown, a lot of people have almost just become desensitized to the dysfunction of Washington. And even, you know, now there's just such an extreme example of it -  people losing their food assistance and...CHANG: Exactly.KILEY: ...Being furloughed for weeks on end...CHANG: Right.KILEY: ...And going without paychecks.CHANG: That is California Republican Kevin Kiley. Thank you so much for speaking with us.KILEY: Of course. Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Legal analysts have broadly described the strikes as illegal under both U.S. and international law — in part because they have not been authorized by Congress.   Trump officials invited a dozen members of Congress, including Republican and Democratic leaders and the top lawmakers on intelligence and armed services committees in both chambers. A growing bipartisan group of lawmakers have submitted months of demands for more information on the attacks.   \n   Since the strikes began in September, at least 66 have been killed in 16 strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, according to the administration. Trump said last month he approved covert operations in Venezuela, which was followed by orders to send a surge of U.S. naval forces to the waters off South America. Pentagon officials said the country's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and its strike group, which marks 20% of the Navy's deployed warships is now headed for the region.   On Tuesday, the White House disputed claims it wasn't being transparent enough with Congress regarding the strikes and military buildup in the region. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the meeting is a top example of their cooperation and said his appearance marks the ninth briefing so far.   \"The president made it very clear if senators want to understand the administration's operations against narco-drug traffickers, we are very happy to speak with them about that,\" she said.   Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, agreed.    \"The administration has kept me and other members fully advised, fully satisfied with what they're doing,\" Risch said after Wednesday's briefing.    However, several Democrats complained that earlier congressional briefings were limited in scope and key information was only shared with Republicans.   \n   Last week, top Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Trump administration officials for holding a closed-door briefing with about a dozen GOP Senators — and no Democrats. Warner said someone should be \"fired\" for the oversight.   \"We hit a new low, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive not only to our Democracy but downright dangerous for our national security,\" Warner, D-Va., said.   After Wednesday's meeting, Warner said he remains perplexed why the U.S. has upended its drug interdiction program that allows the Coast Guard to instead detain suspected drug vessels and pursue criminal charges after obtaining evidence.    \"Showing by interdiction, and drug recovery, and … that the individuals on the boats are known narco-terrorists would sure go a long way in convincing Americans and for that matter, the rest of the world,\" Warner, D-Va., said.    Top House Intelligence Committee Democrat Jim Himes said while there's high confidence in U.S. intelligence providing information on targets, he remains worried some of those killed are not who the administration claims and other information gaps. Himes said at least now, the administration is starting to share information.    \"In my world and the intelligence world, when something is done, we get a great deal of detail on every operation. That has not been shared,\" Himes, D-Conn., said. \"Finally they've started to notify Congress of this stuff, until basically ten days ago we had nothing.\"    He said the administration has finally shared their legal defense for the strikes at sea, and some additional information on military operations.   \"But don't misunderstand me, lots of mistakes could get made,\" he added. \"But they are applying the eyes and ears of our intelligence community to these boats.\"   Wednesday's meeting marked the first time Rubio and Hegseth briefed top lawmakers on the strikes since they began more than two months ago. During this time, members have complained they did not have a legal basis for Trump's orders for the attacks, access to a secret list of targets or broader information on evidence recovered and identities of those killed.   \n   A small bipartisan group of lawmakers intends to force a vote to block Trump's use of military forces to engage in hostilities within or against Venezuela. Behind closed doors, Trump officials have been lobbying Republicans to vote no.   Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced the war powers resolution after Trump said he was entertaining the possibility of military strikes inside Venezuela. They argue that — as laid out clearly by the Constitution — Congress retains the authority to declare war, not the president.   An earlier vote to limit the strikes in the Caribbean failed. Two Republicans, Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined Democrats in the 48-51 vote. However, Kaine argued this new vote has a shot at passage, reflecting the earlier resolution's focus on the Caribbean turned off some members and this resolution is more clear cut.\n",

    "body": "\n      Democrats won in a variety of races across the country by combining an anti-Trump message with a positive message on improving affordability.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  In race after race, from congressional redistricting here in California to seats on the Public Service Commission in Georgia, Democrats won. They also won key governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey. Overall, it was a big night in the states for the party out of power in Washington. NPR political reporter Elena Moore and senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson followed races across the country. Hey to both of you.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: Hey. OK. So let's start with what worked for the Democrats. Mara, to start with you, do we know what specific messages from Democrats really resonated with voters? Like, did you see a through line to these very different races last night?LIASSON: I think there was a through line, only there were very different versions of it. It was a message that married an anti-Trump message with a positive message about affordability, that life is too expensive, the reason is Donald Trump, from tariffs to what he's doing to enrich himself and his billionaire friends, but the Democrats are going to bring the cost of living down. Also, the political laws of gravity have not been repealed. When a president is unpopular and his policies are unpopular, his party usually suffers in off-year or midterm elections, and that's exactly what happened.MOORE: We should also say young voters turned out in droves for Democrats, you know, and really elected this - what we can see as a new generation of leaders in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City. You know, historically, young people don't engage heavily in off-year elections, but they kind of carried these candidates to victory, or at least helped carry these candidates to victory. Exit polls show that Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia each received roughly 70% of the under 30 vote.CHANG: Wow.MOORE: And in New York City, nearly 80% voted for Zohran Mamdani. You know, I've been talking to Gen Z and millennials about him all week, and they really feel seen by him. I mean, remember, Ailsa, he's only 34. Dillon Robertson is one voter who supported him in Manhattan. He's 32.DILLON ROBERTSON: People of a younger generation have been really hungry for a long time to have someone who is willing to just take a risk.MOORE: And, you know, these races that we're talking about all have big differences, but as Mara said, that through line is affordability.CHANG: OK. Well, as far as Republicans are concerned, President Trump weighed in last night on social media. And he said, yeah, it was not a good night for anybody in the Republican Party. Mara, what did we learn about Republicans last night?LIASSON: Well, the post was really interesting. Donald Trump said there were two main reasons for the Republican loss. One was the shutdown. He did not call it the Democrat shutdown, as he normally has. And then the other one was him not being on the ballot. And what's so interesting about that is he is never going to be on the ballot again.CHANG: Right.LIASSON: And what he was saying was if - I wasn't on the ballot, so we couldn't energize Republicans. But last night showed us that Donald Trump does energize Democrats whether he's on the ballot or not.CHANG: Well, Elena, how much was President Trump a factor in New York? Because he did endorse Andrew Cuomo, who, of course, ran as an independent and was Mamdani's closest competitor in that mayoral race.MOORE: Yeah. I mean, Trump is always a factor in some respects. And Mamdani did call out Trump directly in his speech pretty forcefully, vowing not to waver in his values. You know, but I would say that this election in New York City was essentially a choice between two versions of the Democratic Party, two generations of the Democratic Party. You know, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was pushing a message rooted in his experience and, you know, this political pragmatism, while Mamdani ran on challenging literally the Democratic status quo and focused on big, ambitious ideas.And I think, you know, that the New York City mayor's race is an example and a reminder that, in many liberal places, progressives and young people, especially, have grown increasingly disaffected. And Democrats are going to have to find a way to win them back, and Mamdani's win may be an example of how to do that.CHANG: Well, Mara, can we talk more about the variation we are seeing inside the Democratic Party? Because Mamdani had a really different political message from the two other Democrats who won last night in New Jersey, in Virginia. What do you take away from the different ways Democrats are carving different paths to victory?LIASSON: Well, I take away that Democrats have to do that. Virginia and New Jersey are different than New York City. And they're all talking about affordability, but only Mamdani was talking about government-run grocery stores or free buses. In Virginia and New Jersey, they talked about affordability in a different way, bringing down energy costs. And I think that the mark of a mature party is that they can speak to the people who are in front of them.I don't think you're going to see Mamdani's platform and proposals replicated in anywhere else in the country except for maybe another blue city. But I do think that his social media strategy, the way he campaigned, that's something that Democrats can learn from.CHANG: Well, Democrats also won out here in California, where voters approved a temporary plan to allow partisan redistricting all through the state. What does all of this tell us about what may be ahead in next year's midterms, you think?LIASSON: What may be ahead is more partisan redistricting.CHANG: Yeah.LIASSON: And I think now California is going to try to carve out five or so Democratic-leaning districts. The president started this all off by asking Texas to find him five more Republican-leaning districts. And this is now, I think, going to become a permanent feature - mid-cycle partisan gerrymandering. And in that game, I still think Republicans have the advantage. They have the ability to redistrict in many more states. And that's going to be one force in this election against the other one, which is that you now have a very unpopular president. You have a very unpopular incumbent party, and voters don't like their policies. And we'll see if the Republicans can gerrymander their way out of what should be a traditional midterm loss.CHANG: That is NPR's Mara Liasson and Elena Moore. Thank you to both of you.LIASSON: Thank you.MOORE: Thanks, Ailsa.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and two deaf men filed the lawsuit against Trump and Leavitt in May. The suit also names White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with the offices for president and vice president. It alleges the White House's failure to provide ASL violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs conducted by the federal government. The suit also claims the White House is in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, which protect free speech and provide for due process, respectively.   NAD Interim CEO Bobbie Beth Scoggins said in a statement to NPR Wednesday that the organization is pleased that deaf and hard of hearing Americans will soon regain access to important information from the government.   \"American Sign Language and accurate captioning are both essential to ensuring full and equal access to information,\" Scoggins said. \"ASL and English are distinct languages, and captions alone cannot meet the needs of everyone in our community. The court's ruling affirms what we have long known: equal access to information from the White House is not optional. We deserve the same timely, direct access to White House briefings as everyone else.\"   \n   The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the judge's decision.   Ali's order specifies that the ASL interpretation must be visible and signed by a qualified interpreter. He was not persuaded by White House arguments that it does provide closed captioning.   \n   \"The defendants correctly note that the plaintiffs are entitled only to reasonable accommodation. But it is not reasonable — indeed it can hardly be called an accommodation at all — to transcribe press briefings into a language that Ford and many NAD members do not know,\" Ali said in the opinion.   Ali is referring to plaintiff Derrick Ford, of Anderson, Ind. Matthew Bonn, of Germantown, Md., is also a plaintiff in the case.   According to the NAD, hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. communicate mainly in ASL, and many deaf and hard of hearing people do not know English. ASL has its own vocabulary and grammar that is different from English.   The judge stopped short of granting the group's request to require ASL interpretation at briefings and events conducted by the vice president, first lady, and second lady. Ali also declined at this time to require that interpretation be provided to news networks and uploaded to the White House website and social media pages. Scoggins says the NAD will continue to vigorously pursue all relief sought in its lawsuit.   The preliminary injunction is intended to give temporary relief to the group and the plaintiffs, as the case plays out in the legal system. Ali is ordering the White House to update the court on its compliance by Friday.\n",

The order followed arguments in which Comey's attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been able to yet review information that was collected years ago as part of an investigation into FBI media leaks.   Comey, who attended the hearing but did not speak, is charged with lying to Congress in 2020 in a case filed days after President Donald Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. Comey has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued that it's a vindictive prosecution brought at the direction of the Republican president and must be dismissed.   \n   Fitzpatrick raised his own concerns, telling lawyers on Wednesday, \"The procedural posture of this case is highly unusual.\" He said it appeared to him that the Justice Department had decided to \"indict first\" and investigate later.   Comey's defense lawyers had already asked for a transcript of grand jury proceedings, citing irregularities in the process and potential legal and factual errors that they said could result in the dismissal of the case.   \n   Fitzpatrick on Wednesday ordered prosecutors to produce grand jury materials and also directed them to give defense lawyers evidence seized through search warrants in 2019 and 2020 from Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and close friend of Comey.   Richman factors into the case because prosecutors say Comey had encouraged him to engage with reporters about matters related to the FBI and say Comey therefore lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee five years ago when he denied having authorized media leaks. Comey's lawyers deny that he made a false statement and say the question he responded to, from Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was vague and confusing and appeared to be centered not on Richman but rather a different individual, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.   Comey's lawyers told the judge they had not been shown by the government the materials taken from Richman, who had earlier served as a lawyer for Comey, and thus could not know what information was privileged and may have been improperly used as evidence.   \n   \"We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today,\" the judge said.   Comey's indictment came days after Trump in a social media post called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and other longtime foes of the president. The indictment was brought by Lindsey Halligan, a former White House aide and Trump lawyer who was installed as U.S. attorney after the longtime prosecutor who had been overseeing the investigation resigned under administration pressure to indict Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.   \n   The Justice Department in court papers earlier this week defended the president's social media post, contending it reflects \"legitimate prosecutorial motive\" and is no basis to dismiss the indictment.\n",

Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   ATLANTA — Democrats flipped two seats on Georgia's statewide Public Service Commission by wide margins, one of many surprise victories for the party Tuesday up and down the ballot in the handful of races across the country.   Polling shows the Democratic Party is historically unpopular, but at polling places this year voters have helped the party overperform in elections against the backdrop of President Trump's even less popular policies.   Beyond the blowout victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governors' races, Zohran Mamdani winning a majority of votes in New York City's mayoral election and California voters approving a plan to temporarily redraw the state's congressional districts to add Democrat-leaning districts, the party continued its trend of electoral success in the 2025 general election.   \n   Here are some other notable election results around the country:   In Georgia, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson will be the newest members of the state's five-person public utility regulator after earning roughly 60% of the vote. It's the first time Democrats have won a nonfederal statewide office there since 2006 and one where soaring energy costs and displeasure with incumbents dominated the race.   Pennsylvania voters chose to retain three state Supreme Court judges that were first elected as Democrats after millions of dollars in outside spending driven by conservative billionaire Jeff Yass' efforts to reshape the state court's politics. Democrats also won special elections for a seat on Pennsylvania's Superior Court and a seat on its Commonwealth Court.   Also in Pennsylvania, Democrats swept the top \"row offices\" in the purple-hued Bucks County, electing the county's first-ever Democratic district attorney and defeating an incumbent Republican sheriff a year after Trump narrowly won there. Democrats similarly notched commanding victories in county executive races in Erie, Lehigh and Northampton counties, all bellwether counties in recent presidential elections.   At the state legislative level, Mississippi Democrats have broken a GOP supermajority in the state Senate after flipping two seats in that chamber plus another pickup in the state House. A federal court ordered lawmakers to redraw 14 total House and Senate districts after finding the maps drawn in 2022 discriminated against Black voters.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A lying Statue of Liberty is on display outside a polling station Tuesday in Arlington, Va. Virginians hit the poll on Election Day to pick their next governor but also expanded the majority for Democrats in the state's House of Delegates.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats have also vastly expanded their control of the Virginia House of Delegates and in New Jersey's General Assembly, the party gained a supermajority.   \n   In many local races across the country, Democrats touted victories that will reshape their communities, like the flipping of all three city council seats in Georgetown, S.C., the unseating of the last remaining Republican city council member in Orlando, Fla., and winning back mayoral races in Connecticut.   For the first time in a half-century, Democrats control the Onondaga County legislature that includes Syracuse, N.Y. Democrats saw a city council seat in Charlotte, N.C., switch parties for the first time since 1999.    Democrats across the ideological spectrum won, too. Beyond Mamdani's victory in New York City, the Democratic Socialists of America touted municipal wins for members in Detroit, Atlanta and Cambridge, Mass., among others.   \n   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin previously predicted in an interview with NPR that the party's success in special elections in 2025 — where the party has overperformed prior margins by an average of about 14% — would continue into the midterm cycle.   \"The important thing to remember is midterm elections are not a referendum on a party that's not in power,\" Martin said. \"So our numbers really don't matter here. Donald Trump is at an all-time low in terms of his favorability and his approval numbers… the Republican Party is as well.\"   Tuesday's results also show that the economy and affordability continue to be top of mind for voters, and voters have registered their displeasure with Trump and congressional Republicans' agenda on that front.\n",

And he is a longtime member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).   \n   Its New York City chapter played a key role in Mamdani's campaign, providing an early endorsement and a legion of volunteers for canvassing and fundraising — and raising its own profile in the process.   \"Since [Mamdani's] primary win in June, Democratic Socialism has soared in popularity here and across the nation,\" the NYC-DSA tweeted after his general election win. \"Our unprecedented growth is a testament to our vision and our ability to inspire renewed hope and political engagement from the working class.\"   As Mamdani's campaign pushed democratic socialism further into the mainstream, it has also raised questions about what the political ideology is — and isn't.   \n   Most notably, President Trump has frequently and falsely criticized Mamdani as a communist in the lead-up to the election. Mamdani refuted that characterization in a June appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, to which he responded, \"I am not.\"   Mamdani went on to describe his brand of democratic socialism, a term that is largely up to interpretation.   \"When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King from decades ago who said, 'Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country,'\" he said, referring to a 1961 speech by Martin Luther King Jr. \"And as income inequality has declined nationwide, it has increased in New York City. And, ultimately, what we need is a city where every single person can thrive.\"   \n   What is democratic socialism?   There is no one-size-fits-all definition of democratic socialism, though its adherents broadly support the government taking control over certain sectors of the economy, such as health care and utilities, to benefit the public rather than private corporations.   \"We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation,\" reads the DSA's website.   The DSA, which has been around since the 1980s, calls itself the largest socialist organization in the U.S. It says it has more than 80,000 members organized into campus and community chapters across all 50 states.   \n   The group says its members are socialists because they reject an international economic order sustained by things like private profit, discrimination and violence \"in defense of the status quo,\" and instead envision a more equitable and humane social order \"based both on democratic planning and market mechanisms.\"   Democratic socialists often distance themselves from historic examples of socialism and communism, which have had largely negative connotations in the U.S. since the Cold War era. Proponents also say democratic socialism goes further than \"social democracy,\" which often involves a strong welfare state operating under capitalism.   \"We believe there are many avenues that feed into the democratic road to socialism,\" the DSA says. \"Our vision pushes further than historic social democracy and leaves behind authoritarian visions of socialism in the dustbin of history.\"   The Communist Party USA says that while it shares some values of democratic socialists — like opposing war and wanting higher minimum wage — it believes those can only happen through a fundamental restructuring of society.   Many democratic socialists acknowledge that radical transformation won't happen in the short term, so they use tools like organizing, lobbying and protesting in hopes of making change within the existing system, at least for now.   \"As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people,\" it explains, naming single-payer Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as examples.   \n   Why is democratic socialism on the rise?    Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont put democratic socialism on many peoples' radars during his 2016 presidential campaign.   While a registered independent, Sanders has described himself as a democratic socialist for decades, the ideology shaping his stances on everything from poverty to health care to higher education.   Sanders is not a member of the DSA. But his candidacy is credited with boosting the organization's membership and visibility, just in time for the first Trump presidency.   \n   Holly Otterbein, an Axios reporter who has covered the rise of socialism, told NPR's It's Been a Minute earlier this week that she saw the biggest increase in DSA membership after Trump's 2016 win.   \"When I've talked to people who have become members of the DSA or DSA leaders, they felt like that 2016 election sort of discredited the Democratic Party in their eyes,\" she said.   Many young voters have become discontented with the Democratic Party, a trend that has continued through the COVID-19 pandemic, economic turbulence and now Trump's second term. All of that has fueled the democratic socialist movement.   \"Socialism is a recurring talking point for people that still can't find ways to get out of the economic precarity that their generation and the immediately prior generations couldn't get out of,\" Lex McMenamin, head of the politics section at Teen Vogue, told It's Been a Minute.   A Gallup poll released in September found that roughly two-thirds of Democrats view socialism positively, up from 50% in 2010, even as Americans as a whole continue to view capitalism more favorably.   What could Mamdani's win mean for the movement?    Recent years have seen the elections of DSA members including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.   Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez — as well as the NYC-DSA — endorsed Mamdani before the primary in June, and have headlined rallies with him in the months since.   \n   After Mamdani's win on Tuesday, an NBC reporter asked Ocasio-Cortez how she would define democratic socialism.   \"To me, it's this radical idea that working people have economic rights,\" she said, listing housing, a livable wage, health care and child care as examples.   \n   Political scientists have cautioned that Mamdani's approach may not be a winning blueprint for democratic socialist candidates running outside of New York City, where registered Democrats heavily outnumber Republicans. But supporters see lessons in his success.   \"He had to defeat a Republican and the old guard of the Democratic party at the same time,\" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, referring to Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \"And he still won resoundingly.   \"And I think the message that that sends is that the Democratic Party cannot last much longer by denying the future, by trying to undercut our young, by trying to undercut a next generation of diverse and upcoming Democrats that ... our actual electorate and voters support.\"   NYC's DSA is already touting Mamdani's victory in recruitment efforts, calling it just the beginning. Notably, Mamdani stressed during his campaign that his platform differs from that of the DSA, and has taken a more moderate stance on issues like eliminating misdemeanor offenses and defunding the police.   McMenamin, of Teen Vogue, says Mamdani's mayorship could change what socialism means to people, depending on how he governs.   \"I think people are going to really want to talk about socialism if some of these policy changes actually start coming into effect,\" McMenamim adds. \"And so what could happen in New York over the next year could make a big change for people in all 50 states.\"\n",

Today's top stories   NPR's senior political editor/correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins the newsletter today to break down the 2025 off-year elections.   Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well, from the marquee gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey to a key redistricting ballot initiative in California and even state Supreme Court races in Pennsylvania. Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections:   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voters cast their ballots at a polling station on Nov. 4, 2025, in Arlington, Virginia. Virginians hit the polls on Election Day to pick their next governor.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n    It's still the cost of living, stupid. Prices, prices, prices. Affordability was a through line in most of the races Tuesday. President Trump's lack of focus on it likely hurt his party, as voters overwhelmingly sided with Democrats on the economy. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways. Republican candidates are in a quandary — Trump is unpopular and a drag with independents, but without him on the ballot, they continue to have problems turning out base voters. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real. Trump made inroads with Latinos in 2024, but that has slid backward. Latinos chose Democrats in the governors' races by 2-to-1 margins. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front. Yes on Prop 50 won big, giving Democrats a chance to counterbalance GOP efforts to squeeze out more Republican House seats. It was a big win for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, too. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year. From Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York to Abigail Spanberger for Virginia governor, there's going to be a real debate on how best for Democrats to present themselves to win in next year's midterm elections.   \n   Stay informed with more news and analysis by subscribing to the NPR Politics newsletter and listening to the NPR Politics podcast.   Today marks day 36 of the ongoing government shutdown, making it the longest in U.S. history. It takes the title from the most recent shutdown, which stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during President Trump's first term in office. With no end in sight, Americans are feeling the worsening impacts every day, from disruptions at airports across the U.S. to federal workers going without a paycheck. Here's how this shutdown compares to previous ones.   The Supreme Court hears arguments today on whether Trump can unilaterally set tariff rates under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Lower courts say he has exceeded his authority, while Trump argues that the measure allows him to impose tariffs to address trade imbalances and fentanyl imports. Tariffs are generating billions of dollars for the federal government, but they are also raising the costs of goods for consumers and frustrating businesses. Listen to the oral arguments in the case here.   Israeli authorities have arrested and detained the military's top lawyer after she admitted leaking footage of Israeli soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee at a facility where Israel has held Palestinian prisoners throughout the war in Gaza. The military advocate general, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, stated in her resignation letter that she authorized the video's release to defuse attacks on investigators handling the case. Tomer-Yerushalmi has now been arrested for leaking the footage.

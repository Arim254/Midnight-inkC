The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"   In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S.A. He had served served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people.   \n   Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.   \n   A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Trump's actions.   \"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"   A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.   The post was part of a broader message by Trump backing Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"   Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.   In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.   \n   Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.   Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.   \n   The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.   Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.   Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.   Argentine President Javier Milei, a staunch admirer of Trump, also gave his support to Asfura in Honduras on Friday.   \"I fully support Tito Asfura, who is the candidate who best represents the opposition to the leftist tyrants who have destroyed Honduras,\" the libertarian president said on his X account.\n",

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said Friday night that the agency is pausing decisions \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\"   \"The safety of the American people always comes first,\" Edlow wrote on X.   The decision follows President Trump's promise of a sharp crackdown on immigration from countries he described as \"third world.\"   \n   Writing on social media on Thursday night, Trump railed against immigrants from impoverished nations, accusing them of being a burden on the nation's welfare system and \"preying\" on natural-born citizens.   \"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" he wrote on Truth Social.   \n   \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\"   The Trump administration is already deporting some immigrants, either to their countries of origin or to third countries, many of which are paid to receive them. Venezuelans were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, a number of migrants were sent to Eswatini and South Sudan, and Rwanda has agreed to accept deportees.   Edlow wrote on social media Thursday that he had been directed to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.\"   He did not say which countries this would entail, and the USCIS did not respond to an NPR request for comment. But a June White House proclamation placed a travel ban on 12 countries of concern.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A makeshift memorial of flowers and American flags stands outside the Farragut West Metro station on Nov. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   These included many African nations suffering from conflict and terrorism such as Chad, Sudan and Somalia — as well as other countries, such as Afghanistan. Another 7 countries were slapped with partial restrictions.    In a statement to CNN, the Department of Homeland Security said it had already halted all immigration requests stemming from Afghanistan and was in the process of reviewing \"all\" asylum cases approved under former President Biden.   The department did not respond to an NPR request for comment.   History of anti-immigrant sentiment   The president's latest comments against immigration was sparked by the revelation that the alleged shooter was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal — a 29-year-old Afghan national who had worked with the CIA to fight the Taliban in his native country and was admitted into the United States in 2021 as a result of his service. In a Thanksgiving Day call with servicemembers, Trump described the shooting as a terrorist attack and the shooter as a \"savage monster.\"   \n   He blamed the Biden administration for Lakanwal's entry to the United States and for a general failure of the immigration system.   \"For the most part, we don't want 'em,\" he said, referring broadly to immigration seekers as gang members, mentally ill and previously incarcerated.   \n   Trump ran both successful White House campaigns on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration, targeting at various points migrants from countries including Mexico and Somalia.   Speaking to reporters on Thursday after the Thanksgiving call, Trump widened his attack to focus not just on the alleged shooter but to rail against immigration to the U.S. and immigrants in general.   When asked by a reporter about the fact that as a former CIA asset, Lakanwal had been vetted, Trump repeatedly berated the reporter as \"stupid.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People detained earlier in the day are taken to a parking lot on the far north side of the city before being transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Oct. 31, 2025, in Chicago, Ill.\n                \n                    Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Asked by another reporter whether he blamed all Afghans for the alleged actions of one, Trump said: \"No, but there's a lot of problems with Afghans.\"   Trump then turned his attention to immigrants from Somalia, who he has repeatedly accused of being gang-affiliated and \"taking over\" Minnesota — home to the nation's largest Somali community.   Questioned about what Somalis had to do with the D.C. shooting, Trump said: \"Nothing.\" But, he added, \"Somalians have caused a lot of trouble.\" .   Later on social media, he described \"Somalian gangs\" in Minnesota as \"roving the streets looking for 'prey' as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.\"   Officials for the United Nations on Friday criticized Trump's call for sweeping halts to immigration seekers.   \"They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process,\" U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva.\n",

Here is what we know.   National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom remembered   Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Summersville, W.Va., joined the service in 2023. Beckstrom's father, Gary, called her his \"baby girl\" and said she had \"passed to glory\" in a Facebook post on Thursday.   West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Friday called for residents to hold a moment of silence for the two victims of the shooting, as both were deployed as part of that state's National Guard.   \n   Morrisey said in a statement Friday that Beckstrom had made the \"ultimate sacrifice\" in service to her state and the nation. He added that both Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, had stepped forward and volunteered for the mission in D.C.   Morrisey also said that Wolfe remains in \"very critical condition.\"   \"These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,\" Morrisey said. \"Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A small memorial of flowers and an American flag has been set up outside the Farragut West Metro station in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The suspect is now facing a charge of first-degree murder   Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who allegedly shot the National Guard members, is now facing a first-degree murder charge.   U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said during an interview with Fox News on Friday that the charges against Lakanwal have been upgraded to first-degree murder and that there are \"many more charges to come.\"   \n   Lakanwal, who was 5 years old when the war in Afghanistan started, immigrated to the U.S. in 2021 when U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban toppled its government. Lakanwal worked with an elite counterterrorism unit, which was operated by the CIA, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit run by U.S. veterans and others who served in Afghanistan. The organization has said specialized units like this one were used to carry out extremely violent clandestine missions.   According to CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Lakanwal was able to resettle in the U.S. with his family because of the work he did on behalf of American intelligence.   \n   Officials are looking for leads in the U.S. and abroad as there is yet no definitive motive for the shooting.   The Trump administration is pausing all asylum decisions   The administration is dramatically tightening its controversial immigration policies.   \n   President Trump posted on Truth Social that he will \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"   U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow also posted on X, that the agency has \"halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.   \"The safety of the American people always comes first,\" Edlow wrote.

The extended rant came in the wake of the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard members who were deployed to patrol Washington, D.C. under Trump's orders, one of whom died shortly before the president spoke to U.S. troops by video on Thursday evening.   A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War is facing charges for the shooting. The suspect emigrated as part of a program to resettle those who has helped American troops after U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.   \n   \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. \"Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won't be here for long!\"   Trump's threat to stop immigration would be a serious blow to a nation that has long defined itself as welcoming immigrants.   Elected on a promise to crack down on illegal migration, Trump's raids and deportations have disrupted communities across the U.S. as construction sites and schools have been targets. The prospect of more deportations could be economically dangerous as America's foreign-born workers account for nearly 31 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   The president said on Truth Social that \"most\" foreign-born U.S. residents \"are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels\" as he blamed them for crime across the country that is predominantly committed by U.S. citizens.   The perception that immigration breeds crime \"continues to falter under the weight of the evidence,\" according to a review of academic literature last year in the Annual Review of Criminology.   \"With few exceptions, studies conducted at both the aggregate and individual levels demonstrate that high concentrations of immigrants are not associated with increased levels of crime and delinquency across neighborhoods and cities in the United States,\" it said.   \n   A study by economists initially released in 2023 found immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. Immigrants have been imprisoned at lower rates for 150 years, the study found, adding to past research undermining Trump's claims.   But Trump seemed to have little interest in a policy debate in his unusually lengthy social media post, which the White House, on its own rapid response social media account, called \"one of the most important messages ever released by President Trump.\"   Trump claimed immigrants from Somalia are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota\" as he used a dated slur for intellectually disabled people to demean that state's governor, Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year, calling him \"seriously retarded.\"   Trump has ramped up his rhetoric since the shooting. On Wednesday night, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who had entered under the Biden administration.   \n   On Thursday, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 \"high-risk\" countries \"to the maximum degree possible.\"   Edlow didn't name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns.\n",

Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, moved to end the prosecution against the remaining defendants after he assumed the case from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who was disqualified by a court late last year.   \"The criminal conduct alleged in the Atlanta Judicial Circuit's prosecution was conceived in Washington, D.C., not the State of Georgia,\" Skandalakis wrote in his motion to dismiss. \"The federal government is the appropriate venue for this prosecution, not the State of Georgia.\"   \n   The prosecution was the last outstanding criminal case against Trump, after a pair of federal prosecutions — one focused on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and another related to the handling of classified documents — were dropped after Trump returned to the White House earlier this year.   Trump cheered the ruling on social media, writing that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia, as the corrupt Fani Willis Witch Hunt against me, and other Great American Patriots, has been DISMISSED in its entirety.\"   \n   The Fulton County DA's office has not responded to a request for comment.   The historic indictment   In Georgia, a Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, in August 2023 in a sweeping racketeering case alleging a conspiracy to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory in Georgia.   The case was spurred in part by a January 2021 recorded phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he asked him to \"find\" 11,780 votes, one more than the margin of Trump's loss in Georgia.   The Georgia case also focused on an alleged scheme to submit a slate of Trump electors despite Biden's victory, to access sensitive voting machine data and an unsuccessful campaign to pressure state officials to interfere with the election result.   \n   After the grand jury indictment, Trump and his codefendants were booked at the Fulton County Jail — with Trump's mug shot becoming a lasting image of the case. Most defendants, including Trump, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Four accepted plea deals — and those remain binding.   The sprawling case was winding its way to trial when attorneys for one of Trump's codefendants filed a motion to dismiss the case premised on a stunning claim: The district attorney had been engaged in an improper personal relationship with a special prosecutor she hired for the case.   Willis acknowledged the relationship had existed, but asserted it had no bearing on the case.   Judge McAfee ultimately ruled that Willis could continue on if the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigned. But a few months later, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed that ruling, removing Willis and her office from the case. The Georgia Supreme Court later declined to hear an appeal, letting the removal stand.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the Georgia election interference case at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta.\n                \n                    Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Skandalakis, a nonpartisan official who Georgia law charged with appointing a special prosecutor, announced in November that he would take the case himself after he was unable to recruit anyone else to assume the case.   \"It's important that someone makes a decision on this case,\" Skandalakis said in a September interview. \"It's important for the public, frankly for the nation, for the defendants, for all the interested parties.\"   That did not mean his decision would be to proceed with the prosecution. While the state charges were insulated in ways that the charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice were not, Trump's lawyers had argued that the case could not continue until he left office in 2029.   The decision now to drop the charges entirely means the case will not proceed even then.   \"This decision will not be universally popular\"   Skandalakis said in making the decision, he would meticulously review the indictment, the law and the case files, including 101 banker boxes of documents and an 8-terabyte hard drive containing the complete investigative file.   \n   Among the options Skandalakis could have considered included dropping the charges against Trump but continuing the case against some or all of his codefendants, or going back to a grand jury for a superseding or updated indictment. The statute of limitations for most felony charges in Georgia is four years and five years for racketeering charges.   Skandalakis stressed that it would be impractical to continue the prosecution. He did say that charges related to Ruby Freeman, a Georgia election worker who faced threats and harassment after being falsely accused of fraud, could continue — but should be brought in Cobb, not Fulton, County.   While cases against some Trump allies involved in efforts to overturn the election continue in other state courts, the Georgia decision brings to a close one of the most high-profile and wide-reaching prosecutions.   Georgia State University Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis disagrees with Skandalakis' finding that there was not a role for the state justice system in this case.   Kreis said states play a crucial part in accountability in election cases because unlike in federal cases, a president cannot pardon people for state charges.   He also said this decision could weaken deterrents, meaning it will be more up to individuals, like secretaries of state, to step in and stop attempts to interfere with election results, rather than the legal system.   And Kreis said a trial would have been a chance for the public to hear the evidence for themselves.   \"This was really an opportunity for justice and reconciliation and a kind of truth-telling that has been squandered,\" Kreis said.   In his motion, Skandalakis wrote: \"I recognize that, given the deep political divisions in our country, this decision will not be universally popular.\" He said his family received threats after he took over the case.   \"The role of a prosecutor is not to satisfy public opinion or achieve universal approval; such a goal is both unattainable and irrelevant to the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion,\" he continued. \"My assessment of this case has been guided solely by the evidence, the law, and the principles of justice.\"\n",

New polling suggests that's a risky bet.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  In Texas, a Republican effort to redraw the state's congressional map to benefit their party makes an assumption about Latino voters. It bets that Latino Texas voters will vote Republican with the same enthusiasm they did in last year's presidential election, when exit polling showed more than half went for Donald Trump. But recent polling suggests that might now be a riskier bet. To understand why, I'm joined now by someone who tracks Latino voters closely. Clarissa Martinez de Castro is vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative with UnidosUS.So earlier this week, Clarissa, the Pew Research Center released a poll showing that 70% of Latinos disapprove of President Trump's performance in office. And your organization, of course, does its own polling. Are you seeing a similar trend?CLARISSA MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Indeed. We did a bipartisan poll of Hispanic voters at the 100-day mark of the new administration and one year out from the 2026 election, so just earlier this month. And certainly, I believe that Hispanic voters are screaming at the top of their lungs that what Congress and the president need to do is raise wages and lower prices. And two-thirds of them, nationally and in Texas, believe that neither the president nor the Republican majority in Congress are paying enough attention to improving the economy.In addition, Latinos are feeling increasingly unsafe due to actions their own government is taking. So nearly two-thirds believe that civil rights and freedoms have eroded under this president. Nearly half are concerned that they or someone close to them can be a victim of political violence. And 4 in 10 say that in their communities, people fear being arrested for immigration reasons, even if they are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents.MARTÍNEZ: How do you think those numbers stack up to what we might see in Texas, where, as we mentioned, Trump's support by Latinos broke records?MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: I think Trump was able to increase support among almost every demographic, including significantly with Latinos, because of economic discontent. So economic discontent helped Biden beat Trump in 2020. It helped Trump beat Biden in 2024. And based on research, it is very clear that voters see that Trump and Republicans now own the economy. So that discontent may very well now be swinging against Republicans, and that's what they need to be paying attention to.MARTÍNEZ: Last week, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito paused a lower court ruling that would have thrown out Texas Republicans' new maps. Now, speaking hypothetically, if the high court allows the new maps to stand, what would that mean for Texas Republicans' chances in the midterms?MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: I think it's not as clear-cut as maybe those holding that pen to the map might have thought, right? I think that they're going to have to work hard to get these voters on the Republican column. And I think outreach is key, both to increase turnout in the midterm - frankly, another thing that Republicans may be banking on is that there's lower turnout in the midterm election. But I think turnout is the difference-maker, and so on the Democratic side, there's opportunity in terms of engaging these voters in whatever district they may fall.MARTÍNEZ: Clarissa Martinez de Castro is vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative, UnidosUS. Clarissa, thanks.MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF OATMELLO'S \"REFLECTION\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Spencer Cox tells NPR's Steve Inskeep why he wants states to regulate artificial intelligence.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Now, the epic investment in artificial intelligence is raising some big questions. Here are two. Where do we get the electricity to run all those new data centers? And once they're all built, what is AI going to do to society? Utah Governor Spencer Cox is one of the elected officials facing those questions. In his recent NPR video interview, he said Utah is promoting more nuclear power plants, yet he also said he worries about the consequences of AI and wants to preserve his state's power to regulate it.What are you trying to do in Utah with nuclear power?SPENCER COX: We're trying to build it, and lots of it. Back in the '50s and '60s, we built nuclear. We built it better than anywhere else in the world. We were the leaders in this technology - clean technology, cheap technology - and then we stopped doing it. So this is the mistake that we've made. Other places in the world kept doing this and doing it very well. We have to change this. It's happening - red states, blue states working together. The federal government finally gets it. They're working through the permitting process on nuclear as well. We can do it. We can get it done.INSKEEP: What thoughts do you have about the downsides of the massive expansion, both of data centers and artificial intelligence?COX: So the expansion of data centers, of course, is going to use an - a tremendous amount of energy. So that's a concern because that's going to raise prices if we aren't doing this. But it's a global arms race. If we don't do this, China and Russia are going to do it. And so we have to be able to compete, or we are at a significant disadvantage, not just an economic disadvantage but a true national security disadvantage.Now, when it comes to the deployment of artificial intelligence as it impacts our kids and our families, our schools, the human-flourishing piece of this, we should also be incredibly cautious. I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI. We've seen how social media companies, the most powerful companies in the history of the world, have used this incredible tool to utterly destroy our kids and our families, their mental health, to use this in ways that have made them a lot of money and gotten people addicted to outrage. AI's going to be even worse.INSKEEP: Pete Buttigieg raised this and talked about growing up in the Midwest, where over the course of 20 or 30 years, most of the auto jobs disappeared...COX: Yeah.INSKEEP: ...And steel jobs and other kinds of jobs, and it was a phenomenal social burden and social problem. And he foresees possibly the same thing happening with AI, except not in 20 or 30 years - happening in three or four or five years.COX: Yeah.INSKEEP: Is that on your mind?COX: This is going to be very different. Plumbers are going to do great. Attorneys are going to do very poorly. We've never had that kind of technological disruption. I don't know what that means. I'm just pointing it out - that it is going to impact a different segment of society than has in the past. And what we're trying to do in Utah is to adopt a human-flourishing model around AI to help companies understand that they have a responsibility not just to make money, but to actually make sure that their products make human life better for all of us and that we should be working closely together.INSKEEP: Are those efforts going to be overwhelmed, though, if we're building more nuclear reactors to build more data centers, to deploy more AI at an unbelievable speed with billions and billions of dollars of investments?COX: Yeah. Well, look, potentially. But there are certain things we can do and certain things that are just impossible to do. Like, that investment is going to happen. That building is going to happen somewhere, no matter what. And so we should make sure that it happens in the right way. It's really going to have to be regulators working closely with the AI companies to make sure that we're protecting our people.INSKEEP: Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, in an NPR video interview.

But it would challenge the governor-elect's bipartisan image and anger Republicans.   \n\n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  In most states, the state legislature controls the congressional district map, and in the redistricting scramble that President Trump set off ahead of next year's midterms, Republicans control more state Houses than Democrats. Virginia is one place Democrats could make changes that benefit their party, even though it is not as heavily Democratic as some other states. Jahd Khalil at member station VPM in Richmond reports that Virginia Democrats say they are ready to go for it.JAHD KHALIL, BYLINE: If Virginia Democrats want to redraw the state's congressional districts, it takes a few steps, and they took one this month. They gave initial approval for an amendment to the state constitution. It would sideline the state's bipartisan redistricting commission and allow new maps to counter the redistricting in Republican states. It passed with a slim majority.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Ayes 21, nos 16. The resolution is agreed to.KHALIL: Just a few days later, Democratic lawmakers won big in elections. It was fueled by anti-Trump sentiment in a state where thousands of federal workers have been fired. Democratic State Senator Mamie Locke, who was once on the commission in question, said voters showed they want to counter Trump's redistricting push.MAMIE LOCKE: What we were doing was not something that they saw as a negative, you know, that Democrats are on the right track in terms of where we are in our politics, and that this is not a bad thing.KHALIL: The legislature still needs to approve the proposed amendment again. Then voters would decide on it in a special election. Senator Ryan McDougle is a Republican and also sat on that redistricting commission. He opposes changing the map now, whatever the recent election showed.RYAN MCDOUGLE: The maps should not be rigged so one party always gets the result that they want. Virginians said, we want to take the politics out of this and put in a bipartisan redistricting. And that's what we did. That's what we should continue with.KHALIL: But the election also made the redistricting possible because Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, will replace Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin. Spanberger hasn't gone as far to say she would sign off on new maps yet. She's talked about keeping all options open, and her spokesperson, Connor Joseph, told NPR Spanberger thinks the legislature should be ready to respond to what Trump's been doing. He got Republican lawmakers in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri to redistrict, possibly picking up several House seats. California Democrats countered most of those with their own new map. But Spanberger often talks about working across party lines, an ideal praised as part of the state's political culture.ERNEST MCGOWEN: Is not necessarily bare knuckles like you would see in California, like you would see in Texas. And so that kind of sense of how Virginia state politics works goes against these kind of national trends.KHALIL: Ernest McGowan is a political science professor at the University of Richmond. But he says that because of Virginia's federal workforce, voters see Trump as a danger.MCGOWEN: Virginia was also hit very very very hard by DOGE and by the government shut down. And so there really is no love for President Trump.KHALIL: It's uncertain which party is ahead in redistricting. There are court challenges, and states are deciding whether to get in or out. Virginia Democrats could get an edge in two or three House seats if they redistrict. Since Republicans hold a few seat majority in the House, any one of those could make all the difference.For NPR News, I'm Jahd Khalil in Richmond.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Trump dismissed any concerns as \"a standard thing.\"   \"Because he's got to sell this to Ukraine. He's got to sell Ukraine to Russia,\" Trump said, aboard Air Force One, on his way to Florida. \"That's what a dealmaker does.\"   The controversy has shined a new spotlight on Witkoff, the president's long-time friend and chief negotiator who has drawn criticism for his lack of experience and go-it-alone style.   \n   The recording is of an October call in the lead up to the release of the original 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine that favored Russia.   Bloomberg reviewed audio of the call and published a transcript. NPR has not independently verified the transcript or call audio.   Trump said Tuesday night he hadn't heard the audio, but also did not have a problem with the characterization of the call.   \"You got to say, 'look, they want this. You've got to convince them with this. You know, that's a very standard form of negotiation,\" he said.   The criticism has been blunt: That Witkoff is not looking for a balanced deal, but carrying water for Russia — a U.S. adversary and the aggressor in a war versus Ukraine, a strategic partner and European ally.   But Trump doesn't seem too concerned. He's sending Witkoff back to Moscow to try to finalize details of the latest plan with Putin.   Trump and Witkoff have a long friendship   Witkoff and the president have been friends for almost 40 years. Trump calls Witkoff \"a special guy\" and \"my pal.\" Their friendship dates back to a chance encounter at a New York Deli at 3 a.m.   Trump had no cash on him. \"I ordered him a ham and swiss,\" Witkoff said, according to a report in Courthouse News about his testimony in Trump's defense during one of Trump's trials last year.   \n   Witkoff said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that he learned the real estate business from Trump.   \"I wanted to be him,\" Witkoff said. \"Everybody wanted to be him. He'd come to 101 Park Avenue, where I was a lawyer. He had this swashbuckling style. I used to see him come in and I used to say, 'God, I want to be him.'\"   Witkoff has described how Trump was there for him when one of his sons died from an opioid overdose in 2011.   \"I have seen his humanity in the quiet moments away from the spotlight in hospital rooms he didn't have to be in — where his presence brought real solace in a dark hour for my family,\" Witkoff said at the Republican National Convention.   During the campaign, Witkoff helped with fundraising. Trump also turned to Witkoff to handle sensitive matters like trying to repair ties with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and presidential primary challenger Nikki Haley.   \"His best friend, Steve Witkoff, came to our house in South Carolina, spoke to me and my husband, and basically wanted a truce between me and Donald Trump,\" Haley said on her podcast. She told Witkoff that Trump had her support.   Picking Witkoff for a role his son-in-law used to fill   Well before assigning him the Ukraine peace deal, Trump picked his old friend as his envoy to the Middle East.   It was the same position that Trump — in his first term — had given to another person whose loyalty was unquestioned: his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.   Kushner, who now runs an investment firm, had also come from the real estate world and handled many tough files for Trump, including Middle East peace, trade talks with Mexico and Canada, immigration reform and parts of the administration's response to the COVID pandemic.   In President Trump's first term, his son-in-law Jared Kushner held the role now filled by Steve Witkoff. Kushner and Witkoff appeared together on Feb. 20 at a Miami conference organized by the non-profit arm of Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund called the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute.   \n   A lot of experts scoffed at Kushner's lack of experience when he started his White House role, and some raised the same questions about Witkoff.   How Witkoff describes his approach to negotiations   The White House has described Witkoff as a trusted friend of the president who left behind a massive business enterprise to serve the country. He doesn't take a salary and pays for his own travel.   Witkoff is certainly no stranger to creating some Russia-related controversy.   Earlier this year, Witkoff raised eyebrows after appearing on Tucker Carlson's podcast and said Putin was \"not a bad guy.\"   In the same interview, Witkoff explained his approach to negotiations. \"There's no doubt I'm always trying to put myself in the shoes of the other person because a good deal has to work fair for everybody,\" he said.   Don Peebles, the real estate entrepreneur, told NPR this spring that he had seen that attitude firsthand during adversarial talks with Witkoff.   \"If I were going to summarize his approach is to find what the other person, other side, wants — and to try to give it to him,\" said Peebles, who fundraised for former President Barack Obama.   Peebles said he thinks Witkoff probably has more high stakes negotiating experience than most diplomats.   He remembers being forced to deal with Witkoff on a big real estate transaction in New York. Peebles considered walking away. He felt like he had a gun to his head, but never by Witkoff.   Witkoff defused the situation, promising not to be disruptive and explained how they would both be better off as partners, Peebles recalled.   \"He took a very adversarial situation from my perspective and not only got the deal done, but we've been friends ever since.\"   War in Ukraine is not the same as a real estate deal   But solving the war in Ukraine is incredibly complex.   \n   Even negotiating giants such as Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and James Baker would have a tough time convincing Putin to lay down his arms, according to Aaron David Miller, who has served as a negotiator and analyst for both Republican and Democratic administrations.   \"Deals are cut when there is urgency,\" said Miller, who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"And urgency is a function of two things: How much pain the parties are under and what are the prospects for gain right now.\"   Miller said that urgency requires a mediator who is prepared \"to use honey and vinegar,\" or incentives and disincentives to produce something that both Putin and Zelensky will be able to rationalize — as well as sell to their own people.   \"I just don't see Putin ready to make the kinds of concessions that would be required to anchor this thing and make it work,\" Miller said.\n",

They recently picked up a second job with Instacart, to help cover their rising costs.    \n   Despite Posey's job as a case manager at a veterans' organization, and his wife's job in child care, they still can't make ends meet. For their Thanksgiving dinner, they got a turkey and some canned goods from a food pantry. They're scraping together the rest of their meal, but Posey said it's put a damper on their holiday spirit.    \n   \"It kind of takes away from the joy,\" he said. \"I don't feel it this year. To be honest, I'm just trying to stay above water.\"   Posey also has seen how much the veterans he works with are struggling. Many saw their federal SNAP food assistance disrupted this month during the government shutdown, and still haven't caught up. The strain is now beginning to show, he said.   \"We're starting to see a lot more people frustrated, a lot more people angry,\" he said. \"You're starting to see an uptick in violence, especially domestic violence, and a lot of substance use, because they're just overwhelmed.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Steve and India Posey say they're not quite feeling the joy of the holidays this year due to rising costs and increased stress they're feeling \"just trying to stay above water.\"\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   In New York City, Queens resident Rosetta Savannah is facing her own challenges. She's one of those who saw their SNAP payments disrupted during the government shutdown and is still waiting for this month's benefits. So far, she's gotten just half of what she normally receives, and she's had extra medical bills.   \n   Her family's Thanksgiving dinner will also be lighter than usual.   \"We're doing mostly chicken, because chicken is cheaper,\" Savannah said. \"I usually bake cakes and pies but I'm not doing that this year.\"    \n   She's also relying on a local food pantry for a small ham and some sides, but she knows there's no guarantee anything will be left.   \"You have to get up super early to at least be maybe the 30th person on line, and then you just wait and see,\" she said.   Savannah is cutting down on gifts this year, too. Her three kids will only get one small present each, instead of the several she usually gives them.   There will also be fewer presents under the tree at Bonnie Green's home in Bethlehem, Penn.    \"I'm significantly cutting out gifts, there's just no way,\" she said. \"I can't afford it.\"   Green, a 60-year-old professional and homeowner, has always considered herself upper-middle class. She loves Black Friday shopping and had planned on buying several new outfits for her kids, and for her first granddaughter's first Christmas. Typically she would also make an elaborate and plentiful holiday feast.   \"I go big,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This year, Bonnie Green is making use of one of her mother's favorite books, which offers ways to celebrate the holidays on a tight budget. Despite the deep cuts she was forced to make after her federal government job was eliminated, Green is determined to keep smiling and focus on the joy, \"even in the midst of austerity.\"\n                \n                    Jacob Schippell\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacob Schippell\n    \n\n   \n   But earlier this year, her job with the National Science Foundation was one of the many eliminated by the Department of Government Efficiency, which President Trump created by executive order on his first day in office. She still has her job as a professor at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania, but her total income is now half of what it was.   \"That's a lot of money that is no longer there,\" Green said. \"It's really tough.\"   That has forced big changes this year. Besides nixing gifts, she's not decorating as she usually does, and her holiday menu is far more modest. Her usual seafood chowder will be replaced by chicken soup. And forget the Beef Wellington and pecan pie, she said. Instead, she's \"leaning in\" to dishes she can make with much cheaper ingredients.    \n   The biggest blow: her sister won't be able to make it for Christmas. That's not only because of the higher airfare, but also because she's feeling the pinch and needs to work an extra shift.   \"I have friends who (say) the economy has never been better,\" Green said. \"I don't know what economy they're living in, but it's not mine.\"   Still Green adds, she feels fortunate compared to others, especially the many low-income students at her school.   She said the campus food pantry is doing nearly double its usual volume, and she's heard from students who say they're so financially strapped they may be forced to drop out of school just shy of getting their diploma, which would put their future earning potential at risk.   \n   Green, who has spent her career researching how to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged students, set up a scholarship fund this fall to help students who are as close to graduating as they are to running out of money.    \"It would be a tragedy beyond words,\" she said. \"They will never be able to (have a seat) at the table without a bachelor's degree. They won't even be invited to the table, and they deserve to be there.\"   So far, the foundation has raised enough to keep one student in school through graduation. But there are dozens more who have been deemed eligible for the program. Green is doing what she can to help. Even as she's cut her holiday spending, she's increased her holiday giving to support the foundation.\n",

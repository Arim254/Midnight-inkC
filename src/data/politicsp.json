Ford, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets assigned to Strike Fighter Squadrons 31, 37, 87, and 213 from embarked Carrier Air Wing Eight, and a U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress operate as a joint, multi-domain force on Nov. 13, 2025.\n                \n                    Paige Brown/U.S. Navy via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Paige Brown/U.S. Navy via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   New documents show the crew on board the United States' newest aircraft carrier are growing increasingly frustrated by design flaws that lead to regular failures in the ship's toilet system.   The USS Gerald R. Ford has been deployed for seven months since it left Norfolk in June. The carrier is currently at the center of the Trump administration's flotilla of Navy ships in the Caribbean. Since the raid that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, the carrier continues to work with the Coast Guard as the U.S. interdicts oil tankers tied to Venezuela.   On board the carrier, the crew is battling a toilet system that the General Accountability Office reported in 2020 was undersized and poorly designed. The system continues to fail during deployment, forcing the crew of 4,600 sailors to live with a system that randomly breaks down during their months at sea.   \n   NPR has obtained documents that include a series of emails that detail the ship's effort to grapple with the breakdowns. Problems with the Vacuum Collection, Holding and Transfer (VCHT) system increased in 2025. The vacuum system was adopted in part from the cruise ship industry. It uses less water, but the system used by USS Ford is more complex. Breakdowns have been reported since the $13 billion carrier first deployed in 2023.   \n   \"Every day that the entire crew is present on the ship, a trouble call has been made for ship's force personnel to repair or unclog a portion of the VCHT system, since June 2023,\" reads an undated document provided by the Navy, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.   The carrier has called for help outside the ship 42 times since 2023. The rate of calls is increasing, with 32 calls happening in 2025;12 calls were made after the carrier started its recent deployment in June.   A March 18, 2025 email from the engineering department sent out to all chiefs on the ship said there were 205 breakdowns in four days. The sailors who work on the sewage system, called hull maintenance technicians (HTs), fell behind in the months leading up to USS Ford's scheduled deployment.   \"Our sewage system is being mistreated and destroyed by Sailors on a daily basis. My HT's are currently working 19 hours a day right now trying to keep up with the demand,\" according to the email.   \n   The average age on the USS Ford is similar to a college campus. For many of the sailors, this is their first extended time away from home. At times the emails almost evoke a floating dorm room, revealing that everything from t-shirts to a four-foot piece of rope have been removed from the system. The vacuum pipes are narrow. Brown paper towels and even commercial toilet paper also cause breakdowns. The most common problem is a valve at the back of the toilets that can be knocked loose and cause all of the toilets (which the Navy calls heads) in one of 10 zones to lose suction.   \"FYI, if you need to use the head, go now. At 13:30, expect the system to come down for about two hours. We are looking for a vacuum leak in zone 6,\" reads a March 18 email from the chief engineer on USS Ford.   A month after the carrier left Norfolk July 24, 2025, initially bound for Europe and the Mediterranean, the mother of a sailor contacted NPR to complain about the unsanitary conditions on the carrier. Around the same time, emails from USS Ford show the executive officer on the Ford was demanding answers from the engineering department about breakdowns.   The most expensive problem is calcium build-ups, which clog narrow pipes, especially in the lower decks of the ship. The 2020 GAO report said the Navy spends $400,000 for an acid flush to restore the system. A document showed the ship has been acid flushed at least 10 times since 2023. The work can only be done in port. A month after USS Ford left Norfolk, the engineering department was struggling to explain the problem to leadership.   \"That's just the nature of VCHT. It's a closed system and thousands of components ship-wide that fail daily. With one commode control valve failure, depending on the location brings down the entire zone,\" according to an Aug. 15, 2025 email from the engineering department.   \n   The crew has been reaching out to the A1B Propulsion Plant Planning Yard at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia for answers, according to an email chain between the carrier and the planning yard. The planning yard is part of Huntington Ingalls Industries, which is the only shipyard in the world that builds Ford Class aircraft carriers. The Navy's In-Service Aircraft Carrier Program Office (PMS312) is responsible for maintaining the carriers.   \"What we want to do is give you a temporary resolution to get your heads into a somewhat functional use until such time 10+ years down the road when PMS312 finally gets around to paying for a redesign,\" reads a July 24 email back to the carrier from the planning yard.   Longstanding problem   Whenever USS Ford wraps up its assignments in the Caribbean, the carrier is scheduled to go into maintenance this year at the Navy's public shipyard, Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia, according to the emails. The Navy has known the system is undersized and riddled with issues for more than a decade. A similar vacuum system was installed on the last Nimitz-Class carrier USS George HW Bush. In 2013, the carrier experienced similar problems, with toilets going off line.   The Navy said Ford will eventually be given an upgrade.   \"GRF (USS Gerald R. Ford) is scheduled to receive VCHT system improvements in upcoming maintenance availabilities. Similar upgrades on CVN 77 (the carrier USS George HW Bush) have resulted in fewer VCHT maintenance issues,\" Lt. Cmdr. David Carter, spokesman for Fleet Forces Command said in a statement to NPR.   The trail of emails provided through the Navy ends in August, before USS Ford sailed for the Caribbean in November to be part of the build up of U.S. forces around Venezuela.   Without providing details, Carter said the problems with the toilets have gotten better as the deployment continues. The average outage is between half an hour and two hours and the problems have had \"no operational impact,\" he said.   \n   Experts say a long-term fix is not expected this year.   \n   Problems with the carrier's waste system were known well before it was given to the Navy. Part of the solution may include putting more sailors on board the ship to keep up with the repairs, though the ship was actually designed to require fewer sailors to operate it than older Nimitz carriers, said Shelby Oakley, director of GAO.   \"It's important to kind of think about, like we're asking you sailors to live in these conditions,\" she said. \"We should at least be able to provide them with living facilities, to be able to not have to kind of struggle in that regard. And it's unfortunate that this is where we're at.\"   The carrier USS Ford was already the most expensive ship ever built by the Navy. It is stacked with new technology and many of the systems had not been proven in the field, which drove up the cost and delayed its delivery to the Navy. Borrowing the sewage system from commercial cruise ships may have been a mistake, said Bryan Clark with the Hudson Institute.   \"Maybe this is an example where they should have kept the old system rather than going after the new technology,\" Clark said.   A cruise ship has a very different mission from a nuclear-powered warship, which is designed to remain at sea for months. It is a cautionary tale, as the Trump administration looks at increasing the pace of ship building, including a proposed battleship that would have potentially even more systems that have not been tested in the field, Clark said.\n",

Kennedy Jr., pictured at the White House earlier this month, promised he would set up the Administration for a Healthy America back in March 2025.

Kennedy Jr. was just a few weeks into his new job as health secretary in March 2025 when he unveiled a dramatic plan to remake the Department of Health and Human Services.   Kennedy quickly determined that the size and structure of his agency — which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes for Health — was \"incomprehensible.\" He said it was bloated and that explained why federal health officials had failed to improve Americans' health.   \"We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies while preserving their core functions,\" he said in a social media video. Those \"core functions\" would be preserved, he explained, \"by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for a Healthy America or AHA.\"    \n   The name plays off of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" slogan.   \n   Weeks into the second year of the second Trump term, many staff and departments of HHS have been eliminated in chaotic cuts handed down on April 1, 2025, but the Administration for a Healthy America does not yet exist.   There's no public information about when AHA might be created, and very little about what staff and programs it would include.   Not a normal process   The most recent public document from HHS about AHA was a budget request published in June. It says that the new agency will \"focus on areas including primary care, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, mental and behavioral health, and workforce development.\"   Those programs are spread out across health agencies, including at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and several centers at CDC.   Congress didn't include any money for AHA in the latest HHS funding bill. Staffers on committees with jurisdiction over HHS tell NPR there have not even been meetings with Kennedy's staff to help secure support for new funding or authorization to stand up the new agency in the future.   \n   Instead, political appointees at HHS are holding secretive planning meetings about AHA, according to seven current and former employees at federal health agencies who spoke to NPR.   HHS would not answer NPR's questions for this story, but in a statement said that planning for AHA was still underway.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Humphrey Building in Washington, D.C. is the headquarters of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n                \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jose Luis Magana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Behind the scenes, rushed and secretive meetings   At CDC in Atlanta, a senior official describes a constant demand for information about budgets, staff and public health work. It's not even clear who is asking for the data or what they plan to do with it, they say, but they understand it is related to AHA planning.   \"All that you're told is that 'they' are asking for this information and they want it now — or they wanted it yesterday.\" The official asked NPR not to use their name because of fears of professional retribution for speaking publicly without authorization. \"'They' can refer to a small circle of people around Kennedy that he trusts, who are either unnamed, or you'll receive a different name each time, so you're never really quite sure where the ask is coming from.\"   A different senior official at HHS, who also asked that NPR not to use their name for fear of professional retribution, echoed that description of political appointees connected to Kennedy holding \"constant meetings in secret about what this new AHA is supposed to look like, but they don't share with anyone in the civil service.\" The source adds there are rumors that Kennedy's team is \"going to stand up AHA in the next few months, like in the spring.\"   \n   There's no public information about who is in charge of planning to create the agency, and HHS did not make anyone available to interview for this story.   \"What does this mean?\"   Dr. Karen Hacker says the process of restructuring HHS has been \"like building and flying the plane at the same time,\" she says. When Kennedy began as secretary, Hacker was the director of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. She was put on administrative leave on April 1 — along with thousands of others at HHS — then retired from CDC. She now works as an adjunct professor and health policy fellow at Emory University.   \n   She says even though her center worked on chronic diseases, a central priority of AHA, her team was sidelined by the political appointees executing Kennedy's vision. \"We never were asked about strategies for reductions, or about what would be best to move, or whether any of these programs were authorized [by Congress],\" she says. \"My center alone had over 40 line items with specific appropriations language.\"   None of that seemed to matter. A third of the staff in her center were cut during the April 1 reduction in force, and the entire center was slated to be eliminated in President Trump's 2026 budget, published in May. \"I do remember having conversations about — 'What does this mean? Wait a second, are we not going to AHA?'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Some centers of CDC are supposed to become part of AHA, but no details about logistics are public.\n                \n                    Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Then and now, there are big logistical questions about how a center in Atlanta with hundreds of staff members and a $1.4 billion budget could become part of a new agency, possibly in Maryland or Washington, D.C.   When it comes to AHA, Hacker says: \"The question remains — what are their plans? Are they planning to roll out a big reorg? Are they planning to consider other alternatives?\"   A former secretary is \"baffled\"   If Kennedy and his team at HHS wanted to reorganize the Department of Health and Human Services and enlist Congress to authorize a new agency, the public would be seeing a very different process unfold.   When it comes to AHA, \"there is no budget authority to create a new agency, there's no congressional framework for what that looks like, there's no staff numbers,\" says Kathleen Sebelius, the former governor of Kansas who served as health secretary under President Obama.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kathleen Sebelius, pictured at a panel event in 2016, set up the Administration for Community Living when she was President Obama's health secretary.\n                \n                    Charlie Riedel/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charlie Riedel/AP\n    \n\n   \n   That lack of engagement with Congress, she says, also shows in Kennedy's disregard for lawmakers' intent when he eliminated staff and programs during the DOGE-fueled firings in April 2025.   \"What I found when I was [secretary] is that a lot of the entities that seemed to me to be redundant had underlying congressional authorization — they passed a specific bill, it had specific appropriations — and in my day, with my president, we paid a lot of attention to that,\" she says. The firings directed by Kennedy and DOGE included many offices required by Congress that have not been reconstituted elsewhere at HHS, despite his promise that the \"core functions\" of the health agencies would be preserved.   \n   \"A lot of what I see at least in these restructuring documents under Secretary Kennedy just absolutely are baffling to me,\" Sebelius says. She mentions the plan to dismantle the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which responds to natural disasters and pandemic threats, and the elimination of several HHS regional offices that states rely on.   Sebelius also has the perspective of having created a new agency during her tenure: the Administration for Community Living, which helps seniors and people with disabilities live at home.   \"We took a year to have listening sessions to really bring a firm proposal,\" Sebelius says. \"It ultimately was in a budget document, and had staff recommendations and jurisdiction recommendations.\"    She says by that time, \"we had buy-in from — not only key members on the Hill — but key members in the communities across the country.\"   When it comes to the Administration for a Healthy America, \"I don't see any of that going on,\" she says.    Incidentally, the Administration for Community Living is one of the entities slated to be dismantled as an independent agency and integrated into AHA.   Staff numbers confusion   While Trump administration officials work quietly on a plan to create an AHA entity at the agency without input or funding from Congress, the American public is left with health agencies diminished by a year of personnel cuts.   Exactly how much HHS has shrunk because of Kennedy's restructuring, DOGE-led buyouts, and retirements, is difficult to pin down. HHS has declined multiple requests from NPR to provide the current number of staff, but the stated goal when the reorganization was announced in March was to reduce the staff by 20,000 people or about 20% of the workforce.   When Kennedy took office, 88,731 staff worked across HHS, according to an official staffing plan from November 2024. The latest version of that plan, dated September 2025, shows 79,717 HHS employees, which represents a cut of only 10%.   \n   It's not clear if that headcount includes staff whose firings have been blocked by the courts and are on administrative leave. Hacker, the former CDC center director, knows of employees who have been in that situation since April. \"They're getting a paycheck, they're getting their benefits, they're just not working in their jobs,\" she says. Other staff who were fired have been brought back.   \n   Just this week, 400 occupational safety staff at CDC who had been on administrative leave were suddenly ordered back to work without explanation. And about thousand HHS workers fired during the shutdown were brought back as part of a deal to reopen the government. They wonder if they'll be re-fired at the end of January when that deal expires.   All of the agencies that are slated to become part of AHA have had deep RIFs, or reductions in force, especially CDC and SAMHSA, the mental health and substance abuse agency. \"There were people in my center [at CDC] that got riffed multiple times — some were brought back and then some were riffed again,\" says Hacker. \"It's a very chaotic scenario.\"   An exercise in branding?   The current CDC official predicts that Kennedy and his allies will create a pilot or initiative at HHS \"by hook or by crook\" to be able to claim success in creating the Administration for a Healthy America. \"They want things fast, they want it to be bright and shiny, they want to capture the attention of the public, and they want it to look like a success up front.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Secretary Kennedy is pictured at an event called the MAHA Summit in November. Kennedy interviewed Vice President JD Vance, and it was carried live on Fox News.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The official does not think it will be an actual new agency funded and backed by Congress. They think Kennedy will find teams and initiatives that were already happening at HHS related to nutrition, fitness and chronic disease prevention and \"brand\" them as \"MAHA wins\" to assert that the secretary accomplished the goals of the new AHA agency, without having to engage with Congress.   \n   Sebelius is skeptical of the idea that Kennedy can create anything close to a new agency on his own. \"You can do a lot on paper and play musical chairs all you want, but at the end of the day, they're gonna have to have some funding and some jurisdiction.\"   She says lawmakers in Congress are either going to buy into Kennedy's plan to create AHA or reject it. \"It's really unclear to me what they're gonna do.\"\n",

So she's doing her best to honor the commonwealth's traditions — but also forge her own.   \"I'm not going to wear a morning coat, not to disappoint anyone,\" she added with a laugh.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Glenn Youngkin (left) and Ralph Northam wear the traditional morning suit at their inaugurations in 2022 and 2018.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images; Kevin Morley/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images; Kevin Morley/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Spanberger, a Democrat, said she wants her inauguration — which will be complete with a parade, a small-business marketplace, and a ball — to showcase the commonwealth's modern vibrancy and diversity. It helps that the two other leaders taking office are also breaking boundaries. Saturday, Ghazala Hashmi will become the lieutenant governor and the first Muslim woman sworn into a statewide office in the country. Jay Jones will become the commonwealth's first Black attorney general.   Spanberger's own historic \"first\" didn't come up a whole lot on the campaign trail, perhaps because the three-term congresswoman and former CIA officer was running against another woman, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, for the job.   Spanberger, who led in fundraising throughout the race, won a decisive 15-point victory in November after a campaign focused on the cost of living and the impact of the Trump administration's federal cuts in Virginia. Democrats see her victory as an early test case of the party's emerging message on \"affordability,\" which they are expected to deploy across the country in this year's midterms.   \n   Economic concerns were at the forefront of her victory speech in November. But Spanberger also paid tribute to the Virginia women in politics before her, including Barbara Johns, a Black teenage activist who led a 1951 school walkout to protest school segregation. The walkout led to a legal case that was later folded into the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education that ultimately desegregated American public schools.   \"She showed us that no matter your age, you can be part of the change and the progress that you want to see here in Virginia and across the nation,\" Spanberger said in her speech. \"We are a nation founded on ideas, but we are a country where it is up to us, the citizens, who must put those ideas into action.\"   She also recognized Mary Sue Terry, a fellow Democrat who served eight years in the Virginia House of Delegates and another eight as attorney general, making her the first woman elected to a statewide position in Virginia.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mary Sue Terry, the first woman elected to statewide office in Virginia, is sworn in as attorney general on Jan. 11, 1986. Terry recalled to NPR that members of the legislature debated what she should wear to the inauguration. \"The speaker, who had been my running mate for three elections, cut the matter short and said, 'Hell, let her wear what she wants to wear.' And that's what I did,\" she said.\n                \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Steve Helber/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Terry said she was surprised and delighted to get a shout-out from Spanberger, who she said is \"not just a woman, but the right woman for the job.\"   In one way, Spanberger's election felt like a vindication, she told NPR. Terry ran for governor in 1993 but lost to Republican George Allen, despite her early advantages in fundraising and the polls. During the campaign, opponents criticized her for being unmarried and childless. The attacks came to a head a month before Election Day, when Terry was accused of covering up a relationship with another woman. The allegation was baseless and came from a psychiatrist who had been prosecuted by Terry's office for having sex with minors, but it dominated news coverage in the critical final weeks of the race. To avoid prosecution, the psychiatrist gave up his medical license.   \n   \"All I knew I could do was stay as centered as I could while internalizing the reality that after 15 years of public service in Virginia, my tenure as an elected official would be over as a result of the allegations of my sexuality and my failure to have children,\" Terry recalled.   She says the episode hurt her deeply, and she worried about what it meant for other women coming behind her.   \"I'm sure that there were those who would consider running who weren't comfortable with what I went through, and the prospect of what they would go through,\" Terry said. \"It was terrible.\"   But in her concession speech after she lost the race, Terry told her supporters she still believed another woman would succeed one day.   \"Somewhere in Virginia tonight, the first woman governor of Virginia is watching,\" she said, to cheers.   And while Spanberger can't remember if she watched Terry's speech more than thirty years ago — she was in ninth grade at the time — she does remember how excited her mother was about Terry's candidacy, which she insisted on making \"a teachable moment\" for Spanberger and her two sisters.   \"I know that I was watching her campaigning and excited and inspired by that,\" she recalled. \"Just because it didn't go all the way to the inaugural day, doesn't mean that it wasn't impactful on all of us.\"   Spanberger has a big job ahead of her. She'll need to steer Virginia through a lagging economy and federal cuts to health care and the social safety net, which she pointed out will deeply affect Virginia women, particularly mothers caring for children.   \"It's becoming incumbent on states to endeavor to bridge the gap where possible to ensure that it's not kids and their caregivers who are bearing the largest brunt of those choices,\" she said.   \n   She cited conversations with hospital systems in Virginia who may be forced to shrink or eliminate costly labor and delivery units as they weather federal shifts. She also said she would focus on policies to improve the economic reality of Virginia women, including reducing the state's childcare waitlist to allow caregivers to more easily rejoin the workforce.   But for now, Spanberger is also relishing the chance to shape a new image of what a Virginia governor can be — particularly for the littlest Virginians. She recounted a recent example from a father she met at an event.   \"When he was leaving his home that afternoon, he said, 'Oh, I'm going to go meet the next governor,' and his little daughter said, 'Okay, well tell him hello.' And he said to his daughter, 'Actually, no, it's a woman. The next governor is a woman.'\"   \"The little girl said, 'A GIRL governor?!'\"\n",

The administration had already surged federal agents — sometimes accompanied by military troops — to Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, Charlotte, Memphis, Washington D.C. and New Orleans.   Now the White House is threatening to cut funding for sanctuary cities. Here's a brief explanation of how local governments interact with federal immigration enforcement, and what the White House can and can't require from them.   \n   A fight over federal money    President Trump threatened this week to cut \"significant\" federal funding to sanctuary cities. He hasn't said exactly what money his administration wants to cut, though he gave a deadline of Feb. 1.   Nor has Trump said exactly which cities or states will be targeted, though the Department of Justice did publish a list of more than 30 cities, states and counties in August. (That list includes the state of Minnesota, though not Minneapolis or St. Paul or their respective counties).   \n   In remarks on Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump seemed to be focused on places that limit their cooperation with ICE.   \"They do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens. And it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come,\" Trump said. \"So we're not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities.\"   This is not the first time President Trump has made a threat like this. During his first term, the president tried to withhold some federal funding from sanctuary cities. More recently, Trump signed an executive order nearly a year ago directing the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to make a list of sanctuary cities and withhold money from them.   \n   But courts have sided against the administration in nearly every case, saying that the federal government cannot use funding to coerce state and local governments into changing their policies on immigration.   \"Here we are again,\" U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco wrote in April. Orrick granted (and later extended) a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 jurisdictions, including San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, St. Paul and New Haven.   \"The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the Cities and Counties and the communities they serve,\" Orrick said.   No precise legal definition of 'sanctuary'   There's no exact legal definition of \"sanctuary city.\" But broadly speaking, the term refers to any city, state or county that limits its cooperation with federal immigration authorities.   The legal questions here are nuanced. Local law enforcement cannot block federal agents from doing their work but courts have said that state and city officers can withhold some cooperation.   \n   The legal arguments are rooted in the U.S. Constitution and the division of powers between the federal government, which is in charge of immigration enforcement, and state and local governments, which run their own police and sheriffs' departments.   Courts have backed states that don't want to share data on residents in their records, including information about driver's licenses. And in many places, state and local law enforcement will not honor what's known as a \"detainer request\" from ICE, which essentially asks police to hold someone in detention until immigration authorities can take custody.   Local officials push back    Virtually all the cities and states the administration has focused on so far are led by Democrats, who don't seem to be backing down after Trump's threat to cut federal money.   \n   \"This is just a threat to intimidate states like New York into bowing into submission. And that is something we'll never do,\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said earlier this week. \"You touch any more money from the state of New York, we'll see you in court.\"   State and city leaders argue there is a fundamental public safety rationale for their sanctuary policies. They say that working with ICE would undermine trust and cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities as they seek to prevent crime.   There's clearly a political aspect to this as well. In many sanctuary cities, voters are asking Democratic leaders not to give in to the White House and its immigration agenda, so local leaders may have a strong incentive to dig in their heels.   Why local cooperation matters    \n   In the past, ICE has found that it's faster and safer to arrest people who are already being held in local jails. And that's one reason ICE was able to make so many arrests during the administration of President Obama, for example, before sanctuary policies were as widespread as they are now.   The White House says a lack of local cooperation is hindering its efforts to build \"the largest deportation operation in the history of our country,\" a pledge Trump made frequently during his reelection campaign.   \"Minnesota's 'leaders' have chosen defiance over partnership,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday.   But Democrats say the administration is deliberately creating confrontations in cities and states that are led by political opponents, provoking chaotic scenes on purpose for reasons that go beyond simply enforcing immigration law.\n",

It's a comical line of questioning for the 25-year-old former financial risk analyst, who estimates he clocks about 100 hours a week on prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket. After a while, understandably, some of the bets blur together. What are his net profits, though? That's a number he's got at the ready.   \"Last month, I made $100,000,\" said Sudeith, who does most of his trading from his laptop while bed-lounging in his Atlanta apartment. He's executing so many orders on the sites, he says, that he has no time to cook. So he DoorDashes every meal.   \n   \"My last salary was $75,000 a year, so I left my job to trade full time,\" he said    Some of his biggest hauls in recent months include lucrative stakes on Time Magazine's person of the year ($40,236), the most-searched person on Google last year ($11,083) and a wager on the New York City mayoral race ($7,448). And of course, a couple thousand here, a couple thousand there on questions like, how many times will a sports announcer say \"air ball\"? And will President Trump use the phrase \"drill baby drill\" at an upcoming press conference? (Traders had $500,000 on the line on this market.)   \"I'm not a fan of Trump, though I do spend most of my day listening to him and tracking what he is doing,\" said Sudeith, noting that whatever candidate in the next presidential race is the most friendly to prediction markets has his vote. \"I could be a single-issue voter. If they're super-super heavy anti-prediction markets, it would be hard for me to vote for them.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sudeith says he made $100,000 last month on prediction market apps.\n                \n                    Evan Frost for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Frost for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The boom of online prediction markets is being driven by the Sudeiths of the world. He's one of millions of traders logging on every day to services like Kalshi and Polymarket to place high-dollar and incredibly risky bets on the outcome of the world in real time, whether it's an award host's turn of phrase to the number of migrants the U.S. will deport this year.   \n   Much like previous financial crazes around meme stocks and NFTs, true believers view prediction markets through a stick-it-to-the-man prism. It's a movement against the elite establishment, they say, whether it's the mainstream media, pollsters or government agencies. This growing group of renegade traders maintain that core truths emerge only after thousands of people express their opinions with their pocketbooks.   \n   \"Markets are the most efficient way to get to real information,\" Sudeith said. \"If you're watching on election night, I think you'll know who the winners are before the news can report it.\"   While the industry may position itself an alternative to the mainstream, the mainstream is embracing it.   CNN and CNBC have struck deals to incorporate Kalshi prediction markets into coverage. The Wall Street Journal's owner, Dow Jones, is partnering with Polymarket, as did the Golden Globe awards this year, with announcers updating viewers on Polymarket odds before every commercial break.   Founders of the prediction markets apps say they enable people to turn their opinion into a financial hedge against things like inflation or a government shutdown, yet skeptics say that is twisty and self-serving logic.   \"They are gambling sites no different than FanDuel or DraftKings, a corner bookie, or a casino in Las Vegas,\" said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a nonprofit that pushes for Wall Street reform.   Kalshi says 'there's no house,' not all agree   Traditional gambling often means wagering against \"the house,\" where the casino acts like the banker, extracting fees and maintaining a competitive edge.   Prediction markets like Kalshi say they're different.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Advertisements by the company Kalshi predict a victory for Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election before the polls closed on Nov. 4, 2025.\n                \n                    Olga Fedorova/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Olga Fedorova/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Here's how they work: A staff member creates \"a market,\" often after one has been suggested by a user, like what will President Trump say at his next Oval Office briefing?   Then anyone can propose a \"strike,\" the lingo for a term that's being bet on, whether, for instance, Trump will say \"Greenland,\" or \"Minnesota,\" or some other word or phrase.   \n   Kalshi staff pick what terms will be bet on for both sides of that \"yes\" and \"no\" wager.   \n   In order to work, however, there needs to be money on both the \"yes\" and the \"no\" side of the market, so Kalshi relies on institutional partners, like the hedge fund Susquehanna International, or everyday users with large enough portfolios to front the cash. This is called being a \"market maker.\" Kalshi provides financial perks and data access to traders who do this.   But because traders are competing with other traders, Kalshi argues there is no house involved in these transactions.   Several federal lawsuits against Kalshi have challenged this notion, claiming that the Wall Street firms that Kalshi taps are indistinguishable from a traditional \"house.\"   One suit filed this month in the Northern District of Illinois highlights that the company itself has a separate entity, Kalshi Trading, that supplies cash on the opposite side of trades.   \"Thus, Kalshi users are betting against the house exactly the same way it would in a brick-and-mortar casino,\" wrote lawyer Russell Busch in the complaint.   Kalshi denies this. Company spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana told NPR that market makers merely price bids and asks and do not have a competitive advantage.   \"Market making is completely different from being a house, because a house has monopoly pricing power, whereas market makers compete with thousands of other market makers to take bids,\" she said.   The Trump family invests in prediction markets. The administration is taking a friendly policy stance   While the Biden administration sought to rein in this industry, Trump's regulators are breaking down barriers to allow it to flourish.   More than $2 billion is now traded every week on Kalshi, an amount the company says is 1,000% higher compared to the Biden years.   Polymaket, which was forced in 2022 to shut down in the U.S. for operating as an unlicensed betting site, recently won the Trump administration's blessing to re-launch in the U.S.   \n   The Trump family is also getting in on the action. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., is on the board of Polymarket, and his venture capital firm invests in the company. He is also a \"strategic adviser\" to Kalshi. Truth Social, the president's social media site, is planning to launch its own prediction market called Truth Predict.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Donald Trump Jr. speaks during The Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas on May 27, 2025.\n                \n                    Ian Maule/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ian Maule/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The explosive growth and permissive regulatory environment has ignited a debate about the underbelly of an industry that essentially turns many features of modern life into potential monetary wins and losses. Fears persist that when elections, politics and foreign invasions become a gamble that insiders could abuse their access for profit and market odds could influence what actually happens.   Then there's the most prosaic, but perhaps more immediate worry: That the prediction markets gamify trading with slickly designed apps, one-click checking account deposits and constant push alerts, catering to compulsive online bettors. They're not unlike other app-based trading platforms, but now almost anything is a potential betting opportunity, which economists and other financial experts say can enable a new generation of gambling addicts.   While individual bets on Kalshi are not public, the app has a leaderboard showcasing top profit winners.   That offers hope to some traders who turn to Discord and Reddit to discuss how losses have set them back.   \"I'm down 2000 this week when I was up 1200 last week,\" wrote a Kalshi trader who goes by Educational_Pain_407 on Reddit. \"Lost it all and keep trying to claw it back. So I don't know what to tell you but right now I don't have enough to pay my bills in my bank account so I can't bet even if I wanted to.\"   There are three federal lawsuits against Kalshi seeking class action status alleging the apps have sucked young traders into gambling addiction.   \n   Officials at Kalshi have said if traders \"lose their shirt that's on them,\" and even the Reddit user behind on his bills concedes it's a matter of personal responsibility: \"Live and learn and pay for your mistakes. The consequences of being an adult,\" he wrote recently.   While online sportsbooks and gambling are nothing new, the rapid speed, volume of cash and ease at which transactions flow across prediction market apps set them apart from other forms of betting, according to legal and financial experts.   \"Like sports betting, these platforms can be addictive. It is the adrenaline rush that the target demographic is chasing,\" said Melinda Roth, a visiting professor at Washington and Lee University's School of Law who studies prediction markets. \"I do believe this is a looming public health crisis.\"   Decoding the lingo: 'Mogged,' 'Fudded,' 'PMT'   Evan Semet, 26, is another diehard prediction markets trader who left his salaried position in finance as a quantitative researcher after he started raking in six figures a month on Kalshi.\"I don't feel the need for another job at the moment,\" he said.   His first golden ticket came via bets on the number of Transportation Security Agency screenings that happen across a certain period on Polymarket.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Evan Semet quit his job in finance to do prediction market trading full time.\n                \n                    Meredith Nierman/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Meredith Nierman/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Semet said he set up a dedicated server through Amazon Web Services to host statistical models that he runs to help him decide where to place bets.   \"It was pretty modelable,\" he said, noting that he leans on the finance savvy he gleaned at a trading firm to make money on predictions. \"Most day traders draw some shapes on a chart and think it has some statistical significance but it's really just astrology,\" he said. \"They're old-school gamblers going off of intuition. I try to be driven by statistics.\"   To stay tapped in, he's often toggling between multiple live trades on one screen and following a discussion among other traders on the social network Discord.   \n   Keeping up on what's happening there requires understanding a hyper-specific type of lingo that's a blend of Generation Alpha and Gen Z slang, repurposed finance terminology and a grab-bag of other cultural influences from gaming to crypto to the gutter humor of fringe sites like 4chan.   If you've been out-maneuvered by another trader, you've been \"mogged.\"   If a market has \"fudded,\" people are selling their positions out of fear, uncertainty and doubt. A \"rulescuck\" is someone who is a stickler for the rules of a betting market and will try to win on a technicality.   A \"bondsharp\" is a well-known community member who frequently puts up money on the other side of a bet.   These are just a handful of the terms required to stay apace of the chats on Discord, where PMTs are often discussing their full port (prediction market trader, and full portfolio, of course).    Loading... \n   \"It is a good amount of terminology. It's borrowing lingo and terms from stuff I've heard at real trading firms mixed with online pop culture,\" Semet said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                \"Sometimes I prefer to not look at all and see how I did later,\" Semet said.\n                \n                    Meredith Nierman/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Meredith Nierman/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Prediction market trading can be a compulsive sport for many of them, who admit they can be dopamine junkies. Others prefer to avoid the pressure-cooker feeling of watching a bet win or lose live.   \"It's an antsy, gambling-like feeling watching it all happen live,\" Semet said. \"It's intense, almost feels like the fog of war, trying to decide what to do,\" he said. \"Sometimes I prefer to not look at all and see how I did later.\"   How predictions markets got into politics   Kalshi's big day came, as it were, on Election Day in November 2020.   That's when they got word that Trump's Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts, greenlit it as a \"designated contract market,\" a blessing that essentially gave the platform a license to operate as a financial exchange.   It was a long time coming.   \n   For years before that, Kalshi's co-founders Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara, former Wall Street traders who met at MIT, had been battling a skeptical CFTC, which had long rejected similar applications over concerns that an events contract platform would operate a type of gambling outside the purview of state gambling commissions. Regulators also feared the bets invited insiders to rig the outcomes of events from sports to elections.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tarek Mansour, (left) and Luana Lopes Lara are co-founders of Kalshi.\n                \n                    Alexey Yurenev/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alexey Yurenev/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   As Kalshi hired lawyers and lobbyists leading up to their CFTC approval, another prediction market, where most are betting with cryptocurrencies, Polymarket, was exploding in growth. It, however, had not bothered to even try to receive federal buy-in. The Biden administration shut down the exchange for operating without a license. Now, Polymarket has the CFTC on its side, and is staging a U.S. comeback.   Two developments helped Polymarket's return: the company acquired a little-known derivatives exchange QCX, which had already obtained CFTC approval. And the Trump administration's CTFC and Justice Department abandoned investigations into Polymarket.   States, however, are on the attack. Massachusetts has sued to push Kalshi out of the state. Eight other states, including New York, New Jersey and Maryland, have sent the company cease and desist letters alleging that it is operating as an illegal and unlicensed sports gambling site. The motivation is clear: Gambling brings in serious tax revenue for states, while prediction markets bring in none.   For both Kalshi and Polymarket, one of the most controversial areas of prediction market trading is elections, an issue Biden-era regulators took Kalshi to court over.   Under the 1936 Commodity Exchange Act, which was updated in 2008 after the financial crisis, future event contracts cannot involve terrorism, assassinations or \"games,\" but political betting is not explicitly banned.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Polymarket prediction market website is seen on a computer screen.\n                \n                    Wyatte Grantham-Philips/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Wyatte Grantham-Philips/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Biden administration lawyers argued that placing wagers on races amounted to a game, a word that is not defined at all in the law. Election bets, the regulators contended, could turbocharge the spread of political misinformation and create financial incentives for voters to cast a ballot even when it's contrary to a voter's political views.   \n   It also puts the CFTC in the awkward position of having to investigate news, whether real or fabricated, that moves a prediction market. Former CFTC officials told NPR that the agency has never been equipped to be \"an election cop.\"   The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. rejected that framing and handed Kalshi a major victory. The court also pointed out that the harm these markets would cause the government was not \"concrete\" enough.   The Trump administration dropped the appeal, unleashing what is expected to be an unprecedented torrent of prediction market cash into this year's midterm elections, which is raising alarms among those pushing for stricter regulations on this industry.   \"AI, deepfakes, and other nefarious activities to attack candidates could easily impact the betting activity and odds, as well as the actual outcome of elections,\" said Kelleher of Better Markets. \"They don't really care who wins or loses. They only care about the volume of bets and driving that volume as high as possible.\"   Regulators appear unprepared. The CFTC usually has five commissioners but currently only has one. Meanwhile, Kalshi's board includes former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who was among the officials who gave the platform its federal approval in 2020.   Former CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson, who left the agency in 2025, said that lack of commissioners comes on top of high levels of turnover among the most senior staff lawyers.   \"We're essentially asking the CFTC to get involved in engaging and policing an element of our democratic process that we really haven't thought carefully enough about,\" Johnson said.   Insider trading scrutiny grows   Before a U.S. operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, one trader on Polymarket banked a nearly half-million-dollar profit on a bet Maduro would not remain president for long.   While the trader's identity remains a mystery, speculation continues to rattle around the internet about whether the person had insider information. The episode has renewed scrutiny on how the companies ensure bets aren't rigged.   \n   On Discord, when traders see a large bet placed that immediately stands out as an outlier, cries of \"the market is insidered\" are common. Proving it is another matter.   As is often the case on the platforms, open-shut evidence of insider trading is elusive. Kalshi requires a government-issued ID to sign up in order to trace any possible market manipulation back to a real person. Polymarket does not, but it has yet to publicly re-launch its U.S. app. Internal and third-party surveillance tools, the companies say, are on the lookout for unusual activity.   Congress has begun to take notice. Following the Maduro trade, Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-NY, and 30 other Democrats, sponsored legislation banning federal officials from using prediction markets to trade on policies or political outcomes using non-public information.   Being up against an insider is always a risk, said full-time prediction markets trader Semet.   \"There's always going to be someone who has more information than you, unless you're the insider,\" he said. \"There are certain accounts that miraculously have every single Google and OpenAI release date nailed perfectly, and it's like, all right, just don't fade those people,\" he said using the slang word for voting against another trader.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Being up against an insider is always a risk, said full-time prediction markets trader Semet.\n                \n                    Meredith Nierman/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Meredith Nierman/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   When asked if he thinks Kalshi and Polymarket are doing enough to combat insider trading, he gave a blunt assessment: \"F*** no,\" Semet said. \"I really don't think they care.\"   \"Tailing,\" or making a bet joining in on a suspiciously large bet is common on the platforms. Bloomberg on Monday reported on a new tool that allows traders to get alerts when anomalous transactions occur so they can potentially cash in on what could be a winning wager.   From the vantage point of these traders, nearly everything has a trading implication.   And that kind of thinking can fuel conspiratorial theories about why something did or did not happen.   \n   Take, for instance, a recent White House press briefing in which press secretary Karoline Leavitt left the room seconds before hitting 65 minutes. To most, that was unremarkable.   Yet on Kalshi, that looked like a secret message, because many thousands of dollars in bets were at stake that she would cross the 65-minute mark.   The chatter about Leavitt was mentioned on CNBC, which got the attention of traders on Discord, who wondered if this or another incident will ever lead to a PMT, prediction market trader, testifying in Washington about rigging the markets.   \"PMT getting called before Congress,\" wrote a Discord user, whose handle is \"permanent resident of hell,\" they added: \"Let's get a market on it.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Immigration is shaping up as a key issue in the race for Minnesota's open U.S. Senate seat, with Democratic candidates trying to navigate how they respond to a surge in federal agents in their state.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis has ignited a national debate about immigration enforcement, especially in the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota, where Democratic Senator Tina Smith is retiring, and the candidates vying to replace her are trying to meet the moment. Minnesota Public Radio's Dana Ferguson reports.DANA FERGUSON, BYLINE: U.S. Democratic representative Angie Craig says it enraged her when fellow Minnesota representative Tom Emmer, a Republican, reacted like this just after the shooting.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM EMMER: People need to understand that there is a ICE officer standing directly in front of the car when it starts to accelerate.FERGUSON: That was Emmer, the House Republican majority whip, on Fox News last week. He said Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Macklin Good, acted in self-defense. And the Trump administration agrees, with Vice President JD Vance saying Good's death was of her own making. To Craig, ICE officers escalated the situation. At the U.S. Capitol in D.C., she confronted Emmer that afternoon, yelling as colleagues intervened to pull them apart.ANGIE CRAIG: Simply told him on the House floor that this political stunt by this administration got a woman killed in Minneapolis today.FERGUSON: Later, Craig reflected on the exchange.CRAIG: We have a number of Republicans across this country who refuse to stand up to this administration, refuse to call for the rule of law. And, you know, I'm not going to let Tom Emmer or anybody else get away with it.FERGUSON: Craig is a moderate Democrat from a swing district that hugs the St. Paul suburbs and spans down into farm country. She's running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. Her Democratic opponent in the race, Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, quickly seized on Craig's voting record on immigration, and her campaign said Craig's dustup with Emmer was a political stunt.PEGGY FLANAGAN: Well, I think this is actually one of the clearest points of contrast between me and my primary opponent, Angie Craig.FERGUSON: Flanagan points to Craig's vote a year ago in support of the GOP-led Laken Riley Act. The policy allows for detention of people without legal status who are charged with crimes ranging from minor theft to assault on law enforcement.FLANAGAN: I just - I think that Minnesotans have a really clear choice. Do you want someone who votes along with Donald Trump and the - you know, the agents who are terrorizing our communities, or do you want someone who, you know, believes that we can have secure borders, comprehensive immigration reform, a pathway to citizenship?FERGUSON: Craig defends that vote by saying the law provides for due process before deportation. And she says Flanagan would have problems of her own if she faced Republicans in the fall.Minnesota's tracked hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud in state government programs, and the Trump administration has pinned blame on Governor Tim Walz for not doing more to prevent it. Craig says as Walz's second in command, Flanagan could take heat for that.CRAIG: Pushing Governor Walz in front of that bus by himself, as she has been his partner for seven years, is kind of disgusting, quite frankly.FERGUSON: Flanagan's campaign says Craig is the one refusing to take accountability and is putting the seat in jeopardy. For their part, Republicans in the running are standing behind the ICE officer who shot Macklin Good.DAVID HANN: You can't keep encouraging people to defy the law and not see bad things happen.FERGUSON: That's David Hann, a candidate who is former chair of the Minnesota Republican Party. He faulted Democrats for demonizing federal law enforcement. Republicans hope that this moment where Minnesota's blue leaders are under fire can help flip the seat that's been in Democratic hands for 16 years.For NPR News, I'm Dana Ferguson in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Today's top stories   President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota to stop protests in Minneapolis. On Wednesday, immigration officers shot an immigrant man in the leg, sparking unrest on the city's north side. There are as many as 3,000 federal immigration officers on the ground or expected to arrive soon in the Twin Cities, NPR's Meg Anderson tells Up First.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters (R) are confronted by an ICE supporter during a demonstration outside the Bishop Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, Minn., on Jan.15, 2026. Hundreds more federal agents were heading to Minneapolis, the U.S. Homeland Security chief said on Jan. 11, brushing aside demands by the Midwestern city's Democratic leaders to leave after an immigration officer fatally shot a woman protester.\n                \n                    Octavio Jones/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Octavio Jones/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Fierce resistance to ICE's presence continues noisily, as community members follow immigration agents in their vehicles. Anderson notes that observers filming and making noise are peaceful acts of resistance that are constitutionally protected. However, ICE has responded aggressively over the last five days with tear gas, flash bangs and pepper balls to disperse crowds. Some people in the community are afraid to leave their homes, including an asylum seeker, who asked to only be identified by her first initial, A. She feels like she can't see a future for herself or her family.   Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado came to Washington, D.C., to meet with Trump for the first time and presented him with her Nobel Peace Prize. She is pushing to remain part of Venezuela's future after the U.S. military operation that resulted in the seizure of Nicolás Maduro. Trump has sidelined Machado and is backing Venezuela's acting president.    \n   🎧 After Maduro's capture, Trump shockingly said he was not backing Machado for president because she didn't have the support or respect within her country. Bloomberg and The Economist's recent polling shows she has substantial support, and people widely believe her party won the disputed 2024 presidential election by a landslide. NPR's Carrie Kahn says the timing of Machado's meeting was extraordinary as acting President Delcy Rodríguez gave a scheduled State of the Nation speech. Venezuela was attacked by the strongest military in the world, but it has to resume diplomatic relations with the U.S., she said.   Yesterday, Trump announced an outline for new health care legislation, which he has dubbed the \"Great Healthcare Plan.\" The White House issued a fact sheet outlining a framework the administration is asking Congress to develop, with four pillars: drug price reforms, health insurance reforms, price transparency for health costs, and fraud protections and safeguards.    🎧 One thing that jumped out to NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin about the fact sheet is that the policies are not new, but like a compilation of the greatest hits of Republican health policy ideas. The proposal doesn't mention repealing Obamacare, but, given the sparse details provided, it seems to want to let people use federal dollars to buy plans that don't offer comprehensive coverage. The president's plan could potentially weaken Healthcare.gov because its plans can be expensive but offer essential benefits and don't discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.   \n   Life advice   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Antoine Doré for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   People who have a fear of not being able to sleep are experiencing a phenomenon called \"sleep anxiety,\" which, if it is left untreated, can prevent people from getting any shut-eye. One of the most effective ways to overcome this form of anxiety is through cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). But you don't need the official program to benefit from CBT-I. Whether you're dealing with some sleep stress or simply struggling with an off-night from time to time, these CBT-I practices can help:    💤 Wake up at the same time every day, which can help your body know when it's time to get sleepy.💤 Pick a time to transition from daytime activities to nighttime activities in an effort to focus on winding down for bed earlier.💤 If stress comes before bedtime, put some dedicated \"worry time\" on your calendar during daylight hours. You could use that time to write out what's bothering you so you can relax later.   For more guidance on how to beat the anxiety of insomnia, listen to this episode of NPR's Life Kit.

    "body": "\n      President Trump had a rather chummy meeting with the New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House Friday after weeks of heated rhetoric,   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  President Trump had an amiable, just about chummy meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House yesterday. The two men showered each other with praise and complimented each other on their political victories.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor. And the better he does, the happier I am.SIMON: It was a remarkable show of mutual regard after weeks of vicious personal attacks. NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez has this story.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: During the New York City mayoral campaign, President Trump called Mamdani a communist lunatic and threatened to cut off funding if he was elected.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Look, the Mamdani thing is - it's a disaster waiting to happen. We can't have a communist in charge of a great, supposedly free enterprise kind of a representative city.ORDOÑEZ: While Mamdani described himself as Donald Trump's worst nightmare. He called Trump a fascist and, in his victory speech, a despot.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: So, Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you. Turn the volume up.(CHEERING)ORDOÑEZ: But on Friday, the two adversaries were full of smiles and promises to partner together on lowering the cost of housing and groceries, while they talked of finding common ground on thornier issues like crime.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I expect to be helping him, not hurting him - a big help, because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City. It's where I come from.ORDOÑEZ: And Mamdani returned the affection.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: I appreciated the meeting with the president. And as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love which is New York City and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.ORDOÑEZ: Now, both have mutual interests in making nice with the other. Mamdani wants to protect federal funding that Trump has threatened to withhold. The president has not shied away from using the levers of federal power to attack his opponents. And Trump, he wants to recapture his economic message that Mamdani has taken and tweaked into his own winning affordability message.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: And I can tell you that there were more New Yorkers who voted for President Trump in the most recent presidential election because of that focus on cost of living, and I'm looking forward to working together to deliver on that affordability agenda.ORDOÑEZ: The show for the public was all kind words. At one point, when a reporter pressed Mamdani if he still thought Trump was a fascist, the president gave him a pass.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. Maybe - I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.ORDOÑEZ: But so much friendliness could come at a cost. Trump had been using Mamdani as a convenient foil, urging Republicans to paint him as the face of the Democratic Party. It was going to be a key talking point for the midterms, and he may well again decide confrontation is better than affection.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I mean, he's got views and - out there, but who knows? I mean, we're going to see what works or he's going to change also. We all change. I changed a lot.ORDOÑEZ: But for now, this mutual praise could complicate Republican efforts to make New York City political ground zero, and it remains to be seen if other prominent Republicans follow Trump's lead when it comes to embracing Mamdani.Franco Ordoñez, NPR News, the White House.(SOUNDBITE OF BIBIO SONG, \"TOWN AND COUNTRY\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Simon talks to Congressman Lloyd Doggett, democrat from Texas, about the redistricting battle in his state and his decision to retract his retirement and run for reelection.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The U.S. Supreme Court weighed on the Texas redistricting fight last night. Justice Samuel Alito issued an order that keeps in place newly passed voting map that favors Republicans - at least for the moment. The order blocks a lower court ruling that had found that the congressional districts were racially gerrymandered, which is illegal.Several members of Congress don't even know which district they'll be able to run in for next year's midterm elections or not, among them, Congressman Lloyd Doggett. As some of - the Democrat initially said he would still run in a newly drawn district. Then he changed course and announced his retirement. Then this week, he said he was back in after the lower court ruling. The congressman joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us.LLOYD DOGGETT: Thank you, Scott.SIMON: And now?DOGGETT: Well, what we have is an administrative stay, as you said, issued by Justice Alito, the one justice who is responsible for the circuit in which Texas is located. It's a temporary stay. And this will give the full court an opportunity to review this. And while I would have preferred that he simply urged the parties to get the briefs in without the stay, I don't think it's indicative of the entire court.And I'm still very hopeful, given the strong writing of the Trump-appointed Judge Brown in Texas, who wrote the opinion for two judges in Texas reviewing the court, finding it a racial gerrymander, finding it was intentional vote division, that that holding will stand and that the court will invalidate the Trump map and maintain the Texas map as it existed prior to August.SIMON: How difficult is it for you to try and plan a campaign this way or, for that matter, try and plan retirement?DOGGETT: Well, I've always felt the best campaign was good government, and I really haven't changed my activity since the decision came down in - earlier in the - with the redistricting earlier in the year. I'll be out doing events in my district in Austin, the only town I've ever called home, as often as I can in coming days, and then we'll be back here vigorously opposing the Trump agenda in another week when Congress reconvenes.SIMON: Congressman Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said this week that the new Texas maps, and I'm going to quote him now, were simply, quote, \"responding in kind to years of Democrats' gerrymandering.\" How do you respond to that?DOGGETT: That it's total nonsense coming from a fanatic. There are Republicans who already gerrymandered Texas. I'm in my fourth different number district as they tried to eliminate me over the last 20 years, running me one time all the way from Austin to Mexico. That hasn't worked for them.This was an action that they took, as the court found, based on race, following a letter from Trump's Justice Department telling Texas if it didn't redraw four districts that favored African Americans and Hispanics, that they were going to take action against the state of Texas. The governor added this issue to the call of the special session for action only because of race, and the speaker bragged about their success thereafter.So I think Judge Brown had good standing to declare that they had engaged in racial gerrymandering and intentional vote deletion, and I hope that the Supreme Court will uphold that finding.SIMON: Would you, Congressman, having had your own district changed under your feet, was it four times - would you like to see politicians get out of the redistricting business or is that practical? Is it just irresistible for them?DOGGETT: Sure. It probably is irresistible. You're right, Scott, but yes, we need to not have politicians selecting their voters. The voters ought to have the say. This was done on a racial basis, but solely so Trump can maintain total unrestrained control, knowing he has a Republican Congress that is so compliant. California took the right step initially with a citizens nonpartisan redistricting.But that has to apply in all 50 states, not just in those that are currently held by Democrats. We proposed doing that three or four years ago under Speaker Pelosi - Republicans blocked it. I wish this entire set of events that's unfolding across the country would lead us to true reform so that we would see all voices represented in Congress instead of just trying to build up the extremes.SIMON: Congressman Lloyd Doggett, who represents Austin in the U.S. House of Representatives. Thanks so much for being with us.DOGGETT: Thanks a lot.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      We take a look at President Trump's peace plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, as well as what we can expect now that he has signed the bill to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced last night she will resign in January. The Georgia Republican said that other than diverging from President Trump on a few issues, including the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, she has been loyal to President Trump.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: My voting record has been solidly with my party and the president. Loyalty should be a two-way street.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: In response to Representative Taylor Greene's announcement, President Trump called her a traitor on Truth Social this morning. Does this tell us something more about what's going on in the Republican Party?ELVING: Surely, it's the cost of crossing swords with this particular president. Insisting on absolute loyalty has been a Trump trademark. But this falling out also says something about what's going on in the party. The remarkable unity that has bolstered Republicans in the Trump era has been tested, and not only by the Epstein files, but by deep differences over policy, especially foreign policy on Ukraine and most especially on Israel.SIMON: President Trump also this week took aim at some Democratic lawmakers, accusing them of sedition over a video they released saying that members of the military are legally allowed to refuse unlawful orders. The president wrote in a post online, this is, quote, \"punishable by death.\" What kind of threat is this, especially at a time when we've seen violence against public figures, including President Trump himself?ELVING: It's akin to the way Trump has talked about people who defied him in the past, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top uniformed officer of the United States, who refused to assist Trump's efforts to defy election results in 2020. Now, the fact is our armed forces swear an oath to defend the Constitution and to follow orders so long as they are lawful. The challenge is what to do when orders clearly go beyond what is lawful.SIMON: President Trump on Thursday signed the bill allowing for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files - total reversal of his course, of course. What's next and when?ELVING: We're supposed to wait up to 30 days to see what's in the files, but there are a lot of question marks. What are the exceptions, the off-ramps, the special circumstances that might withhold some of the files or parts of them? Who's going to decide, and who will review that decision, and who might push back if the files do not all come out?SIMON: The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll this week shows 80% of Americans have little or no confidence in Congress. Now, of course, we ought to add the political parties, the Supreme Court, the presidency, the media score only slightly better. What could this mean as we enter midterm campaigns?ELVING: Right now, Trump's poll numbers are falling, and they're right where they were eight years ago, heading into a cycle where his party lost big and lost control in the House, 2018. And the departure of Marjorie Taylor Greene and others signals a deeper unease within the GOP over the economy and the general perception of Trump and his policies. That means incumbents who usually would not have any trouble getting reelected might struggle this time, and that's good. Whichever party's in power, that's good for democracy. It means incumbents have to campaign and defend their votes.But, Scott, let me walk back something I said last week. I said there were no more elections coming up before the next showdown and shutdown over health insurance. I should have said there were not any more multistate election days or big tests or something like that because there is a special election coming up in a deep red district in Tennessee. There's a Trump-endorsed Republican named Matt Van Epps, and a Democrat who's a state legislator from Nashville, and her name is Aftyn Behn. Trump won that district by 22 points in 2024, but polls show the current race tightening. And the voting is on December 2.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much for being with us. Speak to soon.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.   But how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.   Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.   \n   The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.   The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was \"a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"   \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,\" Trump wrote. \"It's OVER!\"   \n   The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump's decision \"will tear families apart.\" Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, \"This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.\"   Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.   That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.\n",

The order signed by Justice Samuel Alito will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map favorable to Republicans to be used in the midterm elections.   \n   The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections.   \n   The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections.   The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas.   Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case.   If that ruling eventually holds, Texas could be forced to hold elections next year using the map drawn by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 based on the 2020 census.   \n   Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there.   The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina.   The Supreme Court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It's not entirely clear how the current round of redistricting would be affected by the outcome in the Louisiana case.\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks during a press conference on the \"Epstein Files Transparency Act\" at the US Capitol in Washington, DC on November 18, 2025.\n                \n                    DANIEL HEUER/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        DANIEL HEUER/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene became a household name in the run up to the 2020 election for divisive rhetoric, political stunts and enthusiastic support of President Trump. But after growing disagreements with Trump during his second term, Greene announced she will leave Congress in January before her term is up.   Greene said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"   \n   Greene's split with Trump widened in recent weeks as she pushed for the release of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   For months, Greene had been publicly pressing Trump and top Republicans in Congress to release all files from two federal investigations into Epstein. She was part of a small cadre of Republicans who helped force a vote on the House floor to release the files — a process that drove Trump to reverse his position on the documents and led to near-unanimous support for the measure this week.   \n   But before Trump reversed course, he lashed out last week, calling her \"Marjorie Traitor Greene,\" and told reporters, \"Something happened to her over the last period of a month or two where she changed politically.\"   In her post Friday night, Greene defended her decision to fight for the release of those documents.    \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene wrote.   Greene's defiant push against Trump   On a brisk morning this week, Greene stood outside the Capitol with some of the women who say they were abused by Epstein.   \n   \"I've never owed him anything,\" Greene of the president on Tuesday. \"But I fought for him and for America First. And he called me a traitor for standing with these women.\"   The cracks between Trump and Greene grew over the last year, as Greene increasingly pointed out where she saw the president falling short: she called the war in Gaza a genocide, criticized Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, and pressed for expiring health subsidies to be extended, citing the threat of skyrocketing premiums for people in her district, including her own children.   \n   And she was doing it not just on social media or right-wing outlets, but on programs like ABC's The View.   \"What Happened to Marjorie?\"   \"I was thinking, if this was the first time I'd ever seen this person, it sounds like a normal congressperson from Schoolhouse Rock,\" said University of North Georgia professor Nathan Price after Greene's appearance on the daytime television staple.   For some, this new persona may be hard to square with the Greene many Americans first got to know: the congresswoman who embraced QAnon conspiracy theories, liked a post that called for violence against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. and heckled school shooting survivor David Hogg in 2020, before he became a prominent political activist.   Even Trump has publicly mused in recent weeks: \"What happened to Marjorie?\"   Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson says it's a fair question.   \"I am open to the idea that she's had a 'road to Damascus' moment, a conversion, that she sees the errors of the toxicity and wants something that's better,\" Robinson said in an interview with NPR earlier in the week.   On her own social media and with journalists, Greene has been open about addressing claims from Trump and others that she has changed or abandoned the president. NPR reached out to Greene for further comment.   \n   \"Nothing has changed about me,\" Greene told the hosts of The View. \"I'm staying absolutely 100% true to the people who voted for me, and true to my district.\"   Robinson said the changes could be part of a natural evolution for Greene, a former CrossFit gym owner from the Atlanta suburbs.   \"We love to elect outsiders to Congress,\" Robinson said. \"They go to Congress with very little idea of how it works. And if at some point you're like, 'I want to do substantive things that make America better, then I've got to do this a little bit different.\"   Or, Robinson said, she may be trying to broaden her appeal with an important constituency as she weighs a bid for higher office. Trump said last week he showed Greene polling earlier this year suggesting she would flounder in a race for Georgia governor or Senate.   \"Is she intentionally signaling to women, 'The good old boys club ignores us, and I understand your struggles?\" Robinson said.   Both Robinson and Price said Greene's evolution was more about style than substance. She has disavowed some of her more controversial views, but not others, like the unproven assertion that widespread fraud upended the 2020 election result.   The anti-interventionist, anti-elite principles that first propelled her to Congress also remain core to her identity. \"What she's responding to is believing that the President has shifted on these issues,\" said Price.   Some potential political opponents see an opportunity in Greene's break with Trump. Robinson, who worked for Greene's opponent in her first primary race, says in the past he has warned potential challengers not to underestimate her.   \"You are wasting your time,\" Robinson said. \"She will beat you. And I would have said that into infinity until this week.\"   How Greene's district reacted to the shift   But in the 14th Congressional District, it was not clear this week that anything had changed. As chair of the Paulding County Republican Party, Ricky Hess spends a lot of time talking with voters.   \n   \"The issues that they want to talk about involve high property taxes, high health care costs, whether or not their kids will be able to buy a house when they graduate,\" Hess said this week ahead of Greene's resignation.    Hess told NPR he believes Greene's \"America First\" worldview resonates in this heavily working class and rural stretch of Northwest Georgia.   \"She's pretty tapped into what her constituents are wanting, and I have to believe that most of her actions are in service to that,\" Hess said.   Hess said voters saw Trump and Greene as fighters on the same team. Though Martha Zoller, who hosts a political talk radio show that airs across North Georgia, said in an interview Wednesday she didn't believe everyone's minds were made up.   \"People are kind of reeling, if you want to know the truth,\" Zoller said. \"We haven't had a lot of listeners discussing it because they're waiting to see what happens.\"   Georgia political observers noted that Greene has been anything but a predictable politician — including her surprise resignation.    Trump has come to a truce with other politicians he's feuded with, including Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. And his future relationship with Greene could still evolve.   But Zoller said the conflict between Trump and Greene has been about more than just two big personalities falling out on the national stage.   \"I think that the big discussion we're going to be having as Republicans over the next few years is what is the Republican movement once it's not Trump?\"   Zoller said earlier this week it seemed clear that Greene wants to be part of that discussion. But with her resignation, the answer to that question is may be less clear  now than before.   NPR's Stephen Fowler contributed to this report.\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who rose to prominence as one of President Trump's biggest defenders and recently became one of his biggest critics, is leaving Congress.   In a nearly 11-minute video statement, Greene excoriated the Republican Party, House leadership and the start of campaign season \"which means all courage leaves and only safe campaign re-election mode is turned on.\"   Greene's announcement late Friday that she would resign effective Jan. 5, 2026, is the latest escalation of months of clashes with the president over his second term agenda – including the release of the Epstein files.   \n   \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said.    \n   Trump's campaign promise to release files related to the life and death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – and the numerous ways the president stonewalled the release this year before ultimately relenting this week – was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.   The third-term congresswoman also said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"   \"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife,' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"   Greene is one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators who have indicated they do not plan to return to their seats after the 2026 election, joining a number of lawmakers who are retiring or running for a different office.   Her resignation will likely set up a special election to finish the rest of her term in the spring.   \n   The fracturing of Trump's MAGA coalition has been developing for months, with splits over foreign policy issues like bombing Iran and the support of Israel's war in Gaza accompanying questions about domestic effects of tariffs. Greene has been a vocal opponent each time.    Greene has remained ideologically consistent throughout her time in Congress and with her criticism of Trump. Her argument is that the president and the Republican Party have changed and fallen short of the Make America Great Again and America First vision. Notably, her announcement video also blasted the \"political industrial complex of both political parties\" that focuses on which side \"can convince Americans to hate the other side more.\"    \"And the results are always the same, no matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat,\" she said. \"Nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.\"   Greene's retirement announcement comes at a time when the Republican Party – and Trump – are facing a number of setbacks, including defeats up and down the ballot in this month's elections and poor economic headwinds. Now, there is a large and visible dent in the previously impenetrable armor that is Trump's control over the party and its future, accelerating the inevitable questions around what a post-Trump GOP would look like.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump met Mayor Elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office after weeks of fiery rhetoric. Mamdani called the meeting productive.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  President Trump met with the New York City mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, in a much-anticipated meeting between the president of the United States and the incoming mayor of the biggest city in the country. It was stunning in how gracious it seemed to be.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We agree on a lot more than I would have thought.SUMMERS: Let's just remember that Trump has called Mamdani his little communist mayor, and Mamdani has described himself as Donald Trump's worst nightmare. NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez joins us now. Hi there.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.SUMMERS: So Franco, was this meeting as dramatic as some people expected it to be considering how heated things have been between these guys?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, I'd say no, obviously, but also kind of yes. I mean, there were no rhetorical bombs thrown. Trump didn't double down on the name-calling. But it was kind of dramatic in how cordial it was. I mean, they spoke of their shared interests and plans to partner on things like lowering the cost of housing and groceries and energy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I expect to be helping him, not hurting him - a big help, because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City. It's where I come from.ORDOÑEZ: Mamdani returned the affection. I mean, it was very clear, though, that he was not there to ruffle any feathers.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: I appreciated the meeting with the president, and as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.SUMMERS: I mean, Franco, just listening to this, the warmth between them feels a little extraordinary to me.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah, I mean, to me too. I mean, they were all smiles. Trump patted Mamdani on the arm. Even at one potentially tense moment, when a reporter asked Mamdani if he still thought Trump was a fascist, before he could answer, Trump actually jumped in, kind of chuckled and told Mamdani that it was okay to just say yes, that it was easier.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. But maybe - I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together. Yes, please.ORDOÑEZ: But, you know, let's also be clear that this was one meeting. And Trump can be very charming in person, but things can go very sideways and they can go sideways very quickly. And they do really have some big differences. Trump was asked about some of those on immigration and enforcement and crime. And Trump acknowledged that those are differences, while also saying that he expected Mamdani would be a good mayor and that he's likely to surprise some conservatives.SUMMERS: Interesting. I wonder, why is there so much interest in playing nice in this moment? Like, what's really at stake here?ORDOÑEZ: Well, I mean, there's a lot riding on this relationship. I mean, Trump has vowed to pull federal funding from New York City. He's threatened to deploy the National Guard to the city. And as we know, Trump has not shied away from using the powers of the federal government to attack his political opponents. And Mamdani really can't afford that. He can't have Trump having a personal vendetta against New York City.SUMMERS: And what about Trump? Like, what are the politics for him in this situation?ORDOÑEZ: Well, for Trump, he's been struggling in the polls, especially on the economy, and he's been trying to get in on Mamdani's affordability message, which he ran so successfully. Now, Trump won last year on a similar economic message, but he's now been struggling, especially with inflation. So you could make the argument that Trump's kind of trying to ride Mamdani's coattails here on this issue.I mean, interestingly, though, Juana, this new friendliness could also complicate the politics for both sides. I mean, until today, Trump has used Mamdani as a foil, looking to paint him as kind of the face of the Democratic Party, a party full of democratic socialists, he says. And that was likely going to be the key talking point for the midterms. So all this showing of praise really complicates that message, and it raises some serious political challenges for Republicans as they look to next year.SUMMERS: NPR's Franco Ordoñez at the White House.

    "body": "\n      Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her impending resignation last night. We examine what led to the Georgia Republicans' decision and what it might mean for their party's narrow House majority.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  One of President Trump's most outspoken critics in Congress says they're leaving. Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from her seat in the House in the new year. The Georgia Republican was once among the president's fiercest champions, but they fell out over releasing the Epstein files. NPR's Stephen Fowler has covered Marjorie Taylor Greene's career. He joins us now from Atlanta. Thanks so much for being with us.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning.SIMON: What seems to have prompted her decision to resign?FOWLER: Well, Greene put out an 11-minute video late Friday night that details the arc of her nearly five years in Congress. She outlined her path as the embodiment of Trump's MAGA movement, touted bills she passed and causes she championed. But mainly, there was this pervasive disappointment with the president, her party, the leadership of the House and the state of American politics.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties election cycle after election cycle in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more. And the results are always the same.FOWLER: Basically, she says she was elected to govern, and govern is one thing that Congress isn't doing.SIMON: Of course, recently, President Trump called Marjorie Taylor Greene a traitor for supporting the release of the Epstein files. Then he signed the bill into law this week. How does the figure of Epstein play into their relationship?FOWLER: Well, since Trump returned to office, there've actually been a number of policies and positions that have garnered criticism from some Republicans, especially Greene, who said they're not in the spirit of America first. When the U.S. bombed Iran, there was MTG asking how the foreign policy push benefited conservative America-first views. She called Israel's war in Gaza a genocide and has criticized America's support of Israel as not being America-first. Trump's economic policies, tariffs, importing Argentine beef to try and lower domestic prices - well, you get the idea.And on the Epstein files front, Trump's campaign promise to release the files related to his life and death and the numerous ways the president stonewalled the release this year before ultimately relenting this week is another factor. Here's what she said in her video.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREENE: Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for.FOWLER: Scott, this was basically the last straw.SIMON: You mentioned her disappointment with Congress. Republicans, of course, hold a narrow majority there. Did that seem to factor into her decision?FOWLER: Absolutely. January 5, the day she'll resign, is right before the House returns to work in 2026. Republicans do have a narrow majority for now, and Greene hints that it's not being used to govern properly and that she doesn't expect that majority to last. There's also a healthy dose of criticism in her statement about Speaker Mike Johnson keeping the House out both before and during the government shutdown and not doing anything, like addressing health care subsidies.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREENE: The House should have been in session working every day to fix this disaster. But instead, America was force-fed disgusting political drama once again from both sides of the aisle on television every single day.FOWLER: It is not just Marjorie Taylor Greene that wants to get out of Washington, Scott. She's one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators - mostly Republicans - who've indicated they don't plan to return to their seats after the 2026 election, joining a number of other lawmakers who are retiring or running for a different office.SIMON: Does Marjorie Taylor Greene's decision indicate anything - 'cause you cover this beat - about the broader direction of the Republican Party now?FOWLER: Well, it's not just a one-off fight with a member of Congress. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a canary in the coal mine for the state of the Republican Party. The Republicans suffered defeats up and down the ballot in this month's elections. Economic headwinds are not in their favor. And Greene has put a very visible dent in the previously impenetrable armor that is Trump's control over the GOP and its future. There was always going to be questions about what a post-Trump Republican Party would look like. We're now just seeing that sooner and messier than Republicans would've hoped for.SIMON: NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thanks so much.FOWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "description": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York about the ongoing government shutdown and his calls for Democrat",
    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York about the ongoing government shutdown and his calls for Democrats in his state to end it.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  As you might imagine, we've been reaching out to members of both parties as the shutdown continues. Today, we hear from Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. He's on the line with us now. Good morning, Congressman.MIKE LAWLER: Good morning. Thanks for having me.MARTIN: Thanks for coming. So you and other House Republicans from your state have called on New York's Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, to vote for what's called a clean CR to reopen the government. I don't know what kind of communication you have in other times, but have you heard from either of them? Have they responded?LAWLER: No. Unfortunately, they have not. And this has been entirely driven by Senator Schumer and Leader Jeffries. They've created a mess by refusing to pass a clean CR, which they did 13 times under Joe Biden. They have always said that they believe in clean CRs, that we need to keep the government open and funded. And unfortunately, they've changed their positioning because they are concerned about their left flank and wanting to appease the progressive base of their party, who want to see Democrats fighting back against President Trump.MARTIN: Their argument is that the budget and spending bill was crafted without their input, and they just don't agree with substantive position. So why should they vote for it? What do you say to that?LAWLER: It's just not accurate. The CR is based on the Biden spending levels that were negotiated and agreed upon with Democrats and Republicans. And so when you pass these clean CRs - a truly clean CR - that is a continuation of current spending, there's nothing to negotiate. And that's the fundamental point. They are trying to throw in extraneous policy issues that are not rooted in the CR. The CR is to continue current-level spending so that we can negotiate other issues, including finishing our fiscal year '26 appropriation.MARTIN: But they say that this just kicks the can down the road on this substantive issue, and the substantive issue here is extending the subsidies to help people buy insurance through the Affordable Care marketplace at a time when these premiums are expected to rise. I mean, the reality is that these programs have to be priced out, like, a lot of private companies, like this one. We're in open enrollment now. The premiums have to be priced out for the following year. The marketplace opens on November 1. So their argument is that the timing really is crucial. You just don't agree with that? You don't think the health insurance premiums are going to rise? You just don't think the timing really is critical?LAWLER: Well, are they solving the issue by shutting the government down? It doesn't seem like it. It seems like what they've done is created a mess. If you want to solve an issue like the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats put in place for four years and were slated to expire at the end of this year - they knew that they were slated to expire. They passed the bill.And so I have already signed on to legislation to extend the subsidies by a year. And that was part of my point to Hakeem Jeffries. If you're serious about this, if this is the issue you claim it is, then why won't you sign on to this bill with me? Why won't you join this bipartisan bill to do the very thing you claim you want to and extend the subsidy by a year and give more certainty in the marketplace and help ensure that health insurance premiums don't spike? But by the way, since Obamacare took effect in 2010, health insurance premiums have skyrocketed across the country because the whole program is rooted in subsidies. It requires subsidies to make it affordable. That's the fundamental flaw with the whole program.MARTIN: Well, but in fairness, look, in the first Trump term, Republicans controlled both the House, the Senate and the White House, as they do now. I mean, the argument is, since you know that this is a problem, why haven't you as a caucus come up with a solution?LAWLER: Well, I've offered many plans to actually address the challenges with health care. For instance, you shouldn't have an insurance company owning a provider, OK? That should be prohibited. That was allowed under Obamacare. You look at things like the workforce. I have a plan to actually expand out the waivers that allow those who are educated in the United States to remain here if they're here on a visa so that we actually have the workforce we need, expanding out the Conrad 30 to the Conrad 100, prescription drugs, what the president is doing right now to ensure that Americans aren't subsidizing Europeans' prescription drug plans. There are a lot of things that we can and should do to actually reduce overall cost in our health care system. But what the Democrats are talking about here is just continuing subsidies without any reforms, without any change to actually reduce...MARTIN: But again...LAWLER: ...The overall cost.MARTIN: The Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. Couldn't you do this on your own as a caucus?LAWLER: Right. But you know as well as I that you need 60 votes in the Senate, and that's why we're having this discussion. And if Democrats are serious about addressing these issues, they should quickly get back to work and pass a clean CR through the Senate.MARTIN: OK.LAWLER: And then we can address all these other issues that we're talking about.MARTIN: That is Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. He is a Republican. Congressman Lawler, thanks so much for talking to us.LAWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In an unprecedented gathering, almost 800 generals, admirals and their senior enlisted leaders have been ordered into one location from around the world on short notice.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is ordering troops to watch or read his speech last month at Quantico, Va., when he declared the \"woke\" military is gone, decried \"fat generals\" and ordered women in the military to meet the \"highest male standards\" for physical fitness.   The memo, obtained by NPR, calls for servicemembers to complete the \"Warrior Ethos Tasking,\" which includes a link to the video and updated policy memorandums, by the end of the month. The policy memorandums lay out in detail his plans to enhance physical fitness, grooming standards and military readiness.   The memo states, \"All commanders must document the completion of the Warrior Ethos Tasking in a Memorandum for Record.\"   \n   When asked for comment, a Defense Department official, not authorized to speak publicly, said by e-mail, \"The Secretary's speech was for the whole force and this memo just reinforces that guidance.\"   \n   Hegseth spoke on Sept. 30 to hundreds of generals and admirals who were ordered from commands all around the world to an auditorium at Marine Base Quantico.   'Era of Defense Department is over'    Walking back and forth on a stage, with a massive American flag as a backdrop, Hegseth declared, \"Today we end the war on warriors.\" He said \"the era of the Defense Department is over,\" said the new name will be the Department of War, and indicated the Pentagon would shift to a more aggressive culture.   Hegseth, a 45-year-old Army National Guard veteran and former Fox News host, said the U.S. military has promoted too many leaders for the wrong reasons based on race, gender quotas and \"historic firsts.\"   \"Frankly, it's tiring to look out at combat formations, or really any formation, and see fat troops. Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon,\" Hegseth said.   \"Today is another liberation day, the liberation of America's warriors,\" Hegseth said. \"You are not politically correct and don't necessarily always belong in polite society. We are purpose built.\"   \n   The generals and admirals all sat stone-faced as Hegseth spoke. And then they continued that stoical stance when President Trump then addressed them.   \"I never walked into a room so silent before,\" Trump said. \"If you want to applaud, you applaud. You can do anything you want.\"   But a source not authorized to speak publicly tells NPR that before both speeches, and before the cameras were turned on, Joint Chiefs Chairman General Dan Caine told the assembled officers they were to treat the speeches as if they were at the State of the Union, where the Joint Chiefs also show no emotion, keeping with the military's traditional nonpartisan position.\n",

The formation of the group touches off a new chapter in a partisan battle over public health measures that has been heightened by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s advisers declining to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations, instead leaving the choice to the individual.   \n   Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email that Democratic governors who imposed school closures and mask mandates, including for toddlers, at the height of the pandemic, are the ones who \"destroyed public trust in public health.\"   \"The Trump Administration and Secretary Kennedy are rebuilding that trust by grounding every policy in rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science — not the failed politics of the pandemic,\" Nixon said.   The initial members are all Democrats   The Governors Public Health Alliance bills itself as a \"nonpartisan coordinating hub,\" but the initial members are all Democrats — the governors of 15 states plus Guam.   Among them are governors of the most populous blue states, California and New York, and several governors who are considered possible 2028 presidential candidates, including California's Gavin Newsom, Illinois' JB Pritzker and Maryland's Moore.   \n   The idea of banding together for public health isn't new for Democratic governors. They formed regional groups to address the pandemic during Trump's first term and launched new ones in recent months amid uncertainty on federal vaccine policy. States have also taken steps to preserve access to COVID-19 vaccines.   The new alliance isn't intended to supplant those efforts, or the coordination already done by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, its organizers say.   A former CDC director is among the advisers   Dr. Mandy Cohen, who was CDC director under former President Joe Biden and before that the head of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, is part of a bipartisan group of advisers to the alliance.   \n   \"The CDC did provide an important backstop for expertise and support,\" she said. \"And I think now with some of that gone, it's important for states to make sure that they are sharing best practices, and that they are coordinating, because the problems have not gone away. The health threats have not gone away.\"   Other efforts have also sprung up to try to fill roles that the CDC performed before the ouster of a director, along with other restructuring and downsizing.   The Governors Public Health Alliance has support from GovAct, a nonprofit, nonpartisan donor-funded initiative that also has projects aimed at protecting democracy and another partisan hot-button issue, reproductive freedom.\n",

Good morning, Sam.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: So, Sam, is anything changing on Capitol Hill?GRINGLAS: Not really. There have been, you know, some informal bipartisan conversations among a few senators, but they haven't really produced much. And last night, the Senate failed to advance a short-term funding bill for an eighth time. Democrats are holding out to negotiate an extension for expiring health care subsidies. But top Republicans, like Representative Lisa McClain of Michigan, say that there's just nothing to bargain over.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LISA MCCLAIN: So when you ask, what negotiation? - there's nothing to negotiate.GRINGLAS: And meanwhile, the White House Office of Management and Budget says it is making every preparation to batten down the hatches to ride out a long shutdown. The White House says that includes repurposing other funds to pay U.S. troops, who would have missed a paycheck this week, though the plan to cover the next one is unclear.FADEL: OK. The possibility of troops going without pay has put pressure on Congress to act in the past during shutdowns, but now that's off the table. So what else could break the impasse?GRINGLAS: The White House also says it's found money to fund WIC. That's the food aid program for women, infants and children. That may have been another pressure point, but there are still others. Those health insurance subsidies are expiring soon. Plus, there will be more shutdown consequences. Here's House Majority Whip Tom Emmer.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM EMMER: More Americans won't see a paycheck at the end of this month. Benefits like SNAP will be put at risk. Airports will be flooded with flight cancellations and delays amid the busiest time to travel all year.GRINGLAS: And then there are the layoffs. President Trump pledged to fire more federal workers during the shutdown and on Friday laid off some 4,200 people. Though some of those were walked back, Trump said more layoffs may be on the way.FADEL: OK. And Republicans are suggesting that the threat of those layoffs could pressure Democrats to back down. Are they right?GRINGLAS: Well, Democrats say their stance is still resolute, even those whose constituents may stand to feel the impacts most. Lawmakers who represent the D.C. area spoke outside the OMB on Monday, and behind them were dozens of federal workers. This is Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: When they tell you that the shutdown is making them fire these federal employees, do not believe it for a moment. That is a big lie.GRINGLAS: The Trump administration has been slashing the federal workforce for months. A hearing is happening in federal court today over the legality of those layoffs. Van Hollen says Trump will keep making cuts whether the government is open or closed. Trump did tell reporters Tuesday he plans to continue closing Democrat programs. But even if the impacts of a shutdown, Leila, become more severe, an end to this stalemate may not come soon.FADEL: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas.

If the high court overturns the act's Section 2 — a provision that bans racial discrimination in voting — GOP-controlled states could redraw at least 19 more voting districts for the House of Representatives in favor of Republicans, according to a recent report by the voting rights advocacy groups Black Voters Matter Fund and Fair Fight Action.   \n   And depending on when the court rules in the case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, some number of the seats could be redistricted prior to next year's midterm election.   The analysis comes as President Trump continues to lead a GOP push for new maps in Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and other states that could help Republicans preserve their slim House majority after the 2026 election.   The GOP effort could be bolstered by a Supreme Court ruling that eliminates longstanding Section 2 protections against the dilution of the collective power of racial minority voters.   Many of the landmark law's supporters fear such an outcome after the conservative-majority court didn't rule last term on the Louisiana case, and instead scheduled a rare second round of oral arguments, which is expected to focus on the constitutionality of Section 2's redistricting requirements.   \n   A ruling gutting Section 2 could have a cascading effect on congressional maps in mostly Southern states where Republicans either control both legislative chambers and the governor's office or have a veto-proof majority in the legislature — and where voting is racially polarized, with Black voters tending to vote Democratic and white voters tending to vote Republican.   If mapmakers in those states are no longer required under Section 2 to draw districts where racial minority voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidate, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina and Texas could end up with fewer Democratic representatives in Congress. Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee could lose all of theirs, the report finds.   \n   As much as 30% of the Congressional Black Caucus and 11% of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could also be lost.   It all leads to a possibility of Republicans cementing one-party control of the House for at least a generation, says Cliff Albright, co-founder and executive director of Black Voters Matter Fund.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators hold signs and wear shirts for Black Voters Matter Fund outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n                \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Claire Harbage/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"Part of the point that we're trying to make with this report is that what happens in the South doesn't just stay in the South,\" Albright adds. \"This racial gerrymandering has the ability to not just disempower, disenfranchise Black voters and to eliminate Black elected officials and Latino elected officials. What happens in these states impacts the entire country.\"   How the Supreme Court overturning Section 2 could lead to a redistricting \"free-for-all\"   In the Louisiana case, a lower court ordered the state's Republican-controlled legislature to draw a new congressional map after a group of Black voters sued under Section 2.   Section 2 \"ensures all communities of color can still participate equally in the voting process and elect candidates who reflect their interests,\" says Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, whose attorneys are helping to represent those Black voters. \"And if communities of color are not able to do that, we stand to lose what I think most of us believe is so fundamental to our democracy, which is equal participation, equal opportunity.\"   \n   The court-ordered map, which was in effect for the 2024 election, led to Democrats picking up a second seat in Louisiana.   A group of self-described \"non-African American\" voters, led by Phillip Callais, has argued, however, that the race-based redistricting the court ordered to get in line with Section 2 is unconstitutional. Just as the Supreme Court ruled against race-based affirmative action at colleges and universities in 2023, they argue, the court should put an end to race-based political mapmaking under Section 2.   In seeking a rehearing in the Louisiana case, the Supreme Court asked all sides in the case to consider whether the state's \"intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\"   \n   In one of their latest briefs to the high court, Republican state officials in Louisiana now argue against using race \"in any form\" when redistricting.   And in a major shift from past administrations, the Justice Department under Trump agrees that Section 2's protections against racial discrimination are no longer constitutional.   Two years ago, the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument by Alabama Republicans.   \"The court could reaffirm the Voting Rights Act as it did in 2023 in Allen v. Milligan,\" says Atiba Ellis, a professor and an associate dean at Case Western Reserve University's law school. \"But many observers — and I am one of them — have been concerned about the court becoming more and more cynical about race-conscious remedies to address longstanding civil rights wrongs. And this decision has the potential to be the tipping point where the court declares unconstitutional or heavily restricts the ability for Congress to create remedies that promote multiracial democracy.\"   That kind of decision coming amid the ongoing mid-decade congressional redistricting war between Republicans and Democrats, Ellis adds, could set the stage for a true \"free-for-all\" — pointing also to the court's 2019 ruling that partisan gerrymandering is not reviewable by federal courts.   \n   \"It is one thing for politicians on both sides of the aisle to use the power that they have to engage in unprecedented power grabs. But the most important check on those grabs has been the prevention of racial discrimination,\" Ellis says about Section 2. \"Absent the federal law that would prevent that discrimination, I think the consequences could be tremendous and could be felt for decades.\"   The window of time to pass new congressional maps before the midterms is closing as state deadlines draw nearer. Louisiana's top election official, Secretary of State Nancy Landry, has asked the Supreme Court to rule in this case by early January 2026 to avoid disrupting the state's current schedule.   \n   But the timing remains unclear for the Supreme Court, which usually releases decisions for major cases toward the end of its term in June.   The court has confirmed that it plans to discuss early next month if it will take up a North Dakota case about whether private individuals and groups — whose lawsuits have been the main way of enforcing Section 2 — can continue to sue. Republican state officials in Mississippi have also raised that issue in another redistricting case on direct appeal to the high court.   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin asks Michigan Rep. Lisa McClain, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, about the ongoing government shutdown and the prospects for a resolution.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  As you might imagine, we've been reaching out to lawmakers from both parties as the shutdown continues. Today, we have Republican congresswoman Lisa McClain of Michigan. She is the chair of the House Republican Conference, which is responsible for communicating the party's message to members. She's with us now. Congresswoman, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.LISA MCCLAIN: Oh, thanks for having me.MARTIN: So you've called on Michigan's two Democratic senators to help end the government shutdown. We've heard from Sam's piece that there aren't really any public talks going on, but what about privately? Are there any communications back and forth there?MCCLAIN: You know, there are communications. You know, there's always communications. You don't necessarily see those in, you know, out in the media. But people are trying to talk. People are, you know, voicing their concerns, and, you know, I know it appears that both sides are pretty dug in, and I think they are. But at the end of the day, we got to get a resolution to move forward.MARTIN: Any Democrats you think could be persuaded to join the Republicans in passing what we're calling - what's been called the clean continuing resolution?MCCLAIN: Yeah. I think there will be. I think Saturday is - after they get through Saturday, I think the temperature will die down a little bit...MARTIN: Why Saturday?MCCLAIN: ...And people will be - oh, there's that no kings rally that...MARTIN: Oh.MCCLAIN: ...Everyone is, you know, having. And we just - we got to stop the games. We got to stop the showmanship, and we got to get back to working for the American people. And that, I think, is my frustration is our strategy was when we passed the Clean CR, typically, and I think this piece gets really lost, the party who's in charge - and both sides do it, Michel - when you pass a CR, the parties in charge puts a lot of extra policies in there, usually partisan policies. And then what happens is you go to the negotiation table and you're like, all right, I'll take this out, I'll add this in. What we did was a totally different strategy. We said, we're not going to do any gimmicks. We're not going to play any games. We are literally going to pass the exact Clean CR that everybody voted for under the Democratic spending levels in March. We didn't put one policy writer in there. And that's why everyone's like, well, why aren't you negotiating? We have nothing to negotiate...MARTIN: Well...MCCLAIN: ...Because we didn't play any games to begin with.MARTIN: Well, let me just jump in here because the Democrats argue that the issue here - the timing is really relevant here. The issue is that these health insurance premiums...MCCLAIN: Yes.MARTIN: ...Which people get under the Affordable Care Act will rise. Now, about half a million people in your state...MCCLAIN: You're right.MARTIN: ...Have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, premiums will rise...MCCLAIN: You're 100% right.MARTIN: ...Without these subsidies. So my question to you is how do you want to address that? How do you want to address that?MCCLAIN: This is why - this is - exact reason why we passed the Clean CR. No games, no gimmicks. We can get government to work how it is supposed to work. Not backroom deals. But if you pass the Clean CR, that's why we put it on the table - right? - we can negotiate. We can go through committees. We can have these debates. We don't need to have the American people held hostage because of this.MARTIN: OK, but with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress and the White House, why doesn't the caucus address this issue one way or another?MCCLAIN: We are.MARTIN: What's the Republican proposal to address this premium increase?MCCLAIN: Well, we actually have proposals to address the premium increase...MARTIN: What is it?MCCLAIN: ...That's why...MARTIN: What is it?MCCLAIN: ...We need to open the government up...MARTIN: What is it?MCCLAIN: ...So we can...MARTIN: Give me the headline.MCCLAIN: Well, the head - there's not a headline. And the reason why there's not a headline is because since 2010 when we put Obamacare in, I mean, it doesn't work, right? Obamacare was supposed to fix healthcare, and it's done the exact opposite. We've seen this...MARTIN: OK, the president - OK, but in the first...MCCLAIN: But let me finish.MARTIN: In the first trump term...MCCLAIN: But let me finish.MARTIN: ...You have both houses of Congress...MCCLAIN: OK.MARTIN: ...And the White House. In this Trump term, both Houses of Congress and the White House, how do you want to fix it?MCCLAIN: Do you want me to answer...MARTIN: Yes, please.MCCLAIN: ...Or are you going to interrupt me again?MARTIN: Yes, Ma'am.MCCLAIN: (Laughter).MARTIN: I'm definitely going to want you to answer.MCCLAIN: So what I would say is, this isn't a silver-bullet fix. I mean, premiums since Obamacare has been put in, we've had to subsidize it, right? And the only people who are getting rich on this are the insurance companies, and the American people are suffering. So this is going to take just a quick second. It's not going to be done in 30 seconds with more subsidies. It's going to take some time to overhaul. And that's why we need to get back to work. Trust me, if there was a silver-bullet fix, we would do it. But as you know, we have a very diverse conference, right? So what works in one area may not work for another. And that's why this is so critical that we get back to work. But this isn't a healthcare fight. This is a funding fight. This isn't an AG bill fight or a transportation and infrastructure fight. This is a funding fight. So let's deal with the funding, open up the government, and then let's fix what is wrong.MARTIN: Before we let you go, there are about 30,000 federal civilian employees in Michigan. What are you hearing from constituents who are worried about the president's threat to continue laying off furloughed federal workers?MCCLAIN: Yeah. They're really worried.MARTIN: I think you have about 8,000 in your district alone.MCCLAIN: Yeah. We do, and they're frustrated because we shouldn't be in this position to begin with. That's why the Democrats need to stop using the federal workers as political pawns and open up the government. We could have fixed this, and we should never have been in this situation to begin with. But here we are because Democrats are continuing to play games with the American people. Listen...MARTIN: I...MCCLAIN: ...President Trump - go ahead.MARTIN: No - sorry, we're almost out of time. I do hope you'll come back. That's...MCCLAIN: Thank you so much.MARTIN: ...Republican representative Lisa McClain...MCCLAIN: OK.MARTIN: ...Of Michigan, chair of the House Republican Conference. Thank you so much.MCCLAIN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Fast-forward to today.   Some of Symington's cancer patients curse at her for suggesting they vaccinate or wear masks to protect their weakened immune systems while undergoing chemotherapy.   \"I actually had a patient's husband say, 'You only want me to mask because you're a liberal bitch.'\"   Symington is among many doctors who say political attacks on science and medicine are affecting their relationships with patients, particularly in rural communities, where physician recruitment already poses a chronic challenge. Increasingly, misinformation and conspiracy theories about health fill a vacuum created by the lack of doctors, adding challenges to care. Meanwhile, the Trump administration's dramatic changes to health, science, public health and immigration policies are making recruitment of overseas talent tougher.   \n   Conspiracy theories   In the sparsely populated mineral and coal mining towns that dot the area around Rock Springs, Symington says disinformation and political rage run rampant. At a recent county fair, for example, she stood for four hours offering free vials of sunscreen to passersby — but got no takers. One woman asked \"Do you want to know why?\" and then told Symington: \"Doctors have been putting cancer-causing chemicals in sunscreen so we'll all get cancer and they'll enrich themselves.\"    Symington says such conspiracy theories and political divisiveness over health and science have worn away at the basic civilities that once made the community feel cohesive. \"'You're a pharma whore,'\" she's told. \"They say it to my face.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The town of Rock Springs, Wyo., has a population of about 23,000, according to the 2020 census.\n                \n                    Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   A leukemia patient of Symington's refused vaccination, then died of COVID, still angrily believing the disease to be manufactured political fiction. Symington says until recent years, she'd been on friendly terms with that man, who always offered restaurant recommendations and suggestions for spots to rock hunt, which he knew was her hobby. His transformation is emblematic of a broader shift, she says.   \"It's very difficult, helping someone who scorns your help, or diminishes the value of it,\" says Symington, who is 65 and on the cusp of retirement. \"A lot of us who went into medicine did it because we believed we were helping people.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dr. Banu Symington has been called crude names by patients when she suggests they do things to protect their health.\n                \n                    Banu Symington\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Banu Symington\n    \n\n   \n   There's also a surge in use of ivermectin — an anti-parasite drug — adding to patients' peril. \"I have patients who are covertly taking ivermectin and then they end up in the intensive care unit because of a complication from the ivermectin,\" Symington explains. They're doing so on the advice of actor Mel Gibson, offered during his January appearance on Joe Rogan's popular conservative podcast.   Physician shortages   Symington is one of only five full-time oncologists in Wyoming, she says. She also runs the only cancer center in the southwest corner of the state; the next closest one is about a three-hour drive away, in Utah.   \n   \"When I retire, which may be sooner than I planned because of the atmosphere, I don't think they'll be able to recruit anyone,\" she says.   The doctor shortage was already acute and is contributing to a shortening of the lifespans of rural Americans, says Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association.   \"There are so many workforce shortages that people can't get past the junk on the internet to get to a local doc that they can trust,\" Morgan says. \"The only solution really to combat that with is good science, good data, and make sure that local clinicians are at the forefront,\" disseminating accurate information.   But staffing rural health care has also gotten tougher. For many decades, the U.S. has relied heavily on foreign-born doctors; half the country's oncology workforce, for example, comes from overseas. Now, in large part because of the Trump administration's cuts to science, medicine and research funding, as well as new immigration policies, fewer physicians can — or want to — come to the U.S.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The beauty of the Wyoming landscape attracted Symington to the area 30 years ago.\n                \n                    Banu Symington\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Banu Symington\n    \n\n   \n   Symington says this trend is evident in Rock Springs, too, which feels less hospitable, even to domestic transplants like herself, a white female who grew up and trained in Philadelphia.   \"We had a whole bunch of physicians 30 years ago who had emigrated from Canada,\" she says. \"There are no immigrant physicians here now.\"   Morgan says rural America suffers more from health care workforce shortages, because fewer than 5% of doctors grew up in those communities. Morgan sees fostering more homegrown talent as the key.   \"We need to do a better job of keeping our local, rural kids local in the first place,\" he argues. \"That way they're knowing the community, they're trusted in the community, and they can be a trusted resource.\"   Bias revealed   Dr. Jennifer Bacani McKenney is the type of person Morgan is referring to. Her family medicine practice is attached to the hospital in Fredonia, Kansas, where she was born. Her Filipino parents emigrated from big-city Manila to this tiny farming community of 2,000 people in the 1970s, when her father, a surgeon, was recruited to work there. Bacani McKenney says adapting to the community was difficult for her parents initially, but eventually the community embraced them.   \n   \"If this community had not welcomed my dad — or the country had not welcomed my dad — I would not be here and probably not have the doctors that I recruited here,\" Bacani McKenney says.   Bacani McKenney grew up feeling treated like a hometown girl, but says the spread of COVID-19 also revealed how some of her patients perceive outsiders.   \"My patients were calling COVID the China flu and Kung flu — that kind of thing — and saying about 'Asians needing to go back,' and they would say it to my face,\" she recalls. \"I would say, 'You know, I am Asian, right?' And they go, 'Oh, well, we don't mean you.'\"   \n   Bacani McKenney is also an associate dean at the University of Kansas, where she helps place medical students in rural communities for monthlong rotations as part of their curriculum. Recently, she says more students — many of whom grew up in cities, or are racial or sexual minorities — object to that requirement, complaining that they feel unsafe in the tiny towns. Patients will casually make racist jokes, for example. Navigating that, she tells them, is also part of the job.   \"What we tell the students is, 'You're going to be uncomfortable in lots of situations in medicine.'\"   \n   But Bacani McKenney acknowledges politics makes health care harder to manage these days. She's changed how she talks to patients about vaccines, for example. She suggests familiar ones first, hoping to minimize increasing skepticism about other vaccines, including to prevent COVID or flu.   \"There's something about a pneumonia shot or a tetanus shot — people are like, 'Oh yeah, I know that,'\" she says.   Nevertheless, more patients are pushing back against her vaccine recommendations, especially since anti-vaccine champion Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the helm as Health and Human Services secretary and began amplifying views unsupported by scientists and doctors. With them, she tries to keep the conversation going over several visits, if necessary. It's the kind of balancing act her job now requires, she says.   \"I think we have to keep doing it. And if people don't like us because we're having that conversation, they'll probably go somewhere else,\" she says. \"But if I don't have those conversations, I'm not doing my job.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rock Springs, Wyo.\n                \n                    Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Katie Hayes Luke edited the visuals for this story.

In a hearing on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston said she believed the plaintiffs in the case are likely to prove that what the administration has done — using the lapse in government spending to implement layoffs —  is \"both illegal and in excess of authority and is arbitrary and capricious.\"   The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which together represent more than 800,000 federal workers.   \n   In a brief filed with the court Tuesday, the unions accuse the Trump administration of \"using federal employees as pawns to impose political pressure on the Administration's perceived opponents in Congress.\"   \"The harm is now,\" the plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard told the court on Wednesday, describing the emotional trauma that federal employees are enduring.   Illston granted the unions' request for a temporary restraining order to pause the implementation of layoffs already underway and to block any additional layoff notices from being sent out at more than 30 agencies where the unions represent employees.   \n   The Trump administration's attorney, Elizabeth Hedges, said she was not prepared to discuss the underlying merits of the government's actions. Instead, she argued that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case and that the plaintiffs had not shown that they would suffer \"irreparable harm\" without a temporary restraining order.   Illston appeared frustrated and perplexed by the government's unwillingness to engage on the merits during the hearing.   \"This hatchet is falling on the heads of employees all across the nation and you're not even prepared to address whether that's legal?\" the judge asked the government's attorney.   In a brief filed with the court earlier, government attorneys argued any pause would be inappropriate.   \n   \"The President, through [the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB)], has determined that agencies should operate more efficiently and has directed them to consider steps to optimize their workforces in light of the ongoing lapse in appropriations,\" attorneys for the administration wrote in their brief to the court. \"A TRO would prevent agencies from taking steps to implement this policy priority.\"   In recent days, the Trump administration has commenced a new round of layoffs, known as reductions in force, or RIFs. On Friday, at least seven different agencies sent RIF notices to more than 4,000 federal employees, according to a status update from Stephen Billy, a senior adviser to OMB. Noting that the situation is \"fluid and rapidly evolving,\" Billy cautioned that the numbers could change.   On Tuesday, the Trump administration provided a new status update with a slightly lower count, but again emphasized that \"agencies are continually finalizing their RIF plans.\"   \n   Trump says layoffs affect \"Democrat-sponsored programs\"   The lawsuit was originally filed in response to a memo issued by OMB a week before the shutdown. It urged agencies to use the lapse in funding as an opportunity to consider laying off employees who work on programs and activities not consistent with President Trump's priorities.   In the days since, Trump has blamed Democrats for the shutdown and claimed that his administration had no choice but to permanently cut some federal jobs due to the lapse in congressional appropriations, a radical departure from past shutdowns in which the government has only temporarily furloughed employees.   Trump has simultaneously called the shutdown an \"unprecedented opportunity\" to reshape the government.   \"We're ending some programs that we don't want. They happen to be Democrat-sponsored programs, but we're ending some programs that we never wanted and we're probably not going to allow them to come back,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. \"I think [Democrats] made a mistake. I think they made a big mistake.\"   \n   The latest RIFs target the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services at the Department of Education; the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the Department of Housing and Urban Development; the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the Department of Energy; as well as parts of the Internal Revenue Service, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among other agencies.   More than half of the 1,300 CDC employees who received layoff notices on Friday subsequently had those notices reversed over the weekend, according to AFGE. In a declaration filed with the court on Tuesday, Thomas Nagy, an official at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which includes the CDC, confirmed that due to \"data discrepancies and processing errors,\" RIF notices were erroneously issued to nearly 800 HHS employees.   \n   In another court filing, Yolanda Jacobs, president of AFGE Local 2883, wrote that human resources staff at the CDC were directed to issue layoff notices to themselves. After working through the weekend to rescind RIF notices that were sent out in error, those HR staff lost access to their work email accounts and work computers.   In court on Wednesday, Illston noted the errors and said it appeared that actions were being taken without sufficient thought.   \"It's very much 'ready, fire, aim,'\" the judge said, adding that such an approach comes with a human cost \"that cannot be tolerated.\"   Unions: Trump cannot use shutdown to cut programs   The federal employee unions argue in their complaint that OMB and its director, Russell Vought, take the \"legally unsupportable position\" that the lapse in appropriations eliminates federal agencies' legal requirements to carry out programs Congress had previously funded.   The unions allege the memo issued by OMB before the shutdown unlawfully directs agencies to disregard their own authorizing statutes.   Illston appeared to agree with the unions.   \"Overturning agency mandates Congress has put in place — they can't do that,\" she said.   The unions also take issue with guidance the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) subsequently put out, which informs agencies that employees needed to implement RIFs could be directed to work during the shutdown. The unions say this is a violation of the Antideficiency Act, the law that bars federal agencies from spending money during a shutdown, with only narrow exceptions including work that involves \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\"   \"Administration of a RIF is in no way necessary to protect life or property from imminent harm,\" the complaint states.   Trump administration says the court lacks jurisdiction   The lawsuit originally named OMB and OPM, along with their directors, as defendants. It was later amended to include more than 30 federal agencies.   \n   In its response to the complaint filed Friday, the Trump administration had urged the court to reject the unions' demands for a temporary restraining order, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear a case involving federal employment issues. The government points out that Congress created a federal agency, the Merit Systems Protection Board, to handle such matters, although its independence has been compromised under the current administration. It is also almost entirely shut down at the moment.   \n   Attorneys for the government further argued that agencies were making decisions to lay off employees in accordance with proper procedures, noting that 26 agencies named as defendants in the lawsuit had yet to announce RIFs.   In court on Wednesday, the government attorney Hedges cited that lack of action as a reason the court should not issue a blanket pause.   The plaintiffs' attorney Leonard countered that, based on Trump's own statements, it was clear that layoff decisions have, in fact, been made and planning has been underway.   \"RIF notices don't happen in an instant,\" Leonard told the judge. \"The work is being done to prepare RIF notices at agencies probably as we speak, without being paid, in violation of the law.\"   For Judge Illston, another chance to weigh in on federal layoffs   As part of her temporary restraining order, Illston directed the Trump administration to file by Friday evening an accounting of all the layoffs, actual or imminent, that have been enjoined by her order, and also to file a declaration verifying that the government is complying with her order.   The judge will consider whether to issue an indefinite pause on the layoffs at a second hearing on Oct. 28.   This is the second case involving the Trump administration's mass layoffs that Illston is presiding over this year. In May, the Clinton-appointed judge indefinitely paused Trump's sweeping overhaul of the government, finding that the president had failed to obtain authorization from \"his co-equal branch and partner, the Congress,\" as required by law.   \n   \"Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a President may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress,\" Illston wrote in her decision.   The Trump administration appealed the ruling, eventually asking the Supreme Court to weigh in. In a decision issued on its shadow docket, the Supreme Court lifted Illston's order, allowing the Trump administration to resume layoffs while the lower courts consider whether the RIFs being carried out by agencies are lawful.   Subsequently some agencies, including those within HHS, finalized RIFs that had already been announced. But many others said they would not be making further staffing cuts given the large number of federal employees who resigned or retired this year. In fact, some agencies have since hired people back.   \n   Although the Trump administration has characterized the latest round of layoffs as a consequence of the shutdown, many federal employees have told NPR they believe the layoffs are merely a continuation of the president's efforts to slash the federal government — an effort that has been well underway since January.\n",

Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to reopen it. The Senate again tried — and failed — Wednesday to advance a bill to reopen the government. It was the chamber's ninth attempt since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 to vote on a short-term funding bill passed by the House.    The Trump administration has been following through on threats to slash the size of government during the shutdown, laying off thousands of workers late last week. A hearing in federal court today considered the legality of those layoffs; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause RIF notices to federal employees who are members of two unions, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).   \n   Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs.   President Trump has said he plans to fire more federal workers en masse while the shutdown continues and will specifically target what he called \"Democrat programs.\"    While active military members were set to miss their first full paycheck on Wednesday, over the weekend President Trump said he \"identified funds\" to ensure the active military gets paid. The Defense Department will use \"approximately $8 billion\" of unused research and development funding from last year to pay service members if the government doesn't reopen by Oct. 15, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. That would likely only cover one pay cycle and military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.   As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know.      Jump to state-specific impacts.      Why did the federal government shut down?    A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.     \n   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.   Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.    Read more about more on the debate over these subsidies here.    Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR      What about WIC and SNAP benefits?   Among the first to feel the pinch during this shutdown could be the 7 million mothers and young children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program. Funding was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states. And the White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. When asked for more information, the White House referred NPR to USDA, which did not reply to a query. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding.   Lucia Graves of Lebanon, N.H. told NPR she is counting on the benefits to help feed her family, especially as the cost of groceries is on the rise. But continued access if there's a prolonged shutdown will likely depend on states filling the gap, if their budgets allow.   Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October. That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance, so benefits will continue for October. But in a memo seen by NPR, USDA last week told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, \"until further notice.\"    \n   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR   And what about school lunches?   Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.   Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.   \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\"   Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked whether the agency intends to advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist. Instead, the spokesperson blamed the Democrats for \"causing real harm to American farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.\"   — Kadin Mills, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A United States Postal Service (USPS) mail box stands in Manhattan on Aug. 5, 2020 in New York City.

IRS furloughs nearly half its staff   A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.    \n   — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR      Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might   Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.   Layoffs particularly gutted the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. The RIF affects the dozens of staff members responsible for roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's 7.5 million children with disabilities.   In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.   — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR   The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled.

As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.   Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.   The The National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities also closed on Sunday. \"All the animals at the Zoo and at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, will continue to be fed and cared for,\" the Smithsonian said. \"A shutdown will not affect our commitment to the safety of our staff and standard of excellence in animal care.\"   \n   The zoo's animal cams, however, are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.   — Alana Wise, NPR      Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue   Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue. But on Friday, employees at Social Security field offices said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.   As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year.    Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.   But some fair housing offices have been gutted as part of the shutdown RIFs   More than 300 Housing and Urban Development employees received layoff notices over the weekend, according to a tally by AFGE National Council 222, a union that represents HUD workers. A HUD spokesperson says the layoffs are to \"align programs\" with the Trump administration's priorities. The agency did not provide specifics, but a union tally finds nearly a third of those cut are people who investigate allegations of housing discrimination.    HUD union steward Paul Osadebe says the layoffs appear to gut some entire offices — in Atlanta, Kansas City, Fort Worth and Denver. They come on top of previous major cuts to HUD's fair housing staff.   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR      There could be missed paychecks and lost jobs   Perhaps the biggest impacts will be felt by federal workers who are set to miss their first full paycheck during the government shutdown later this month. President Trump on Saturday said he had \"identified funds\" to make sure the active military does not miss its Oct. 15 paycheck, but absent a breakthrough in Congress it remains unclear how the military would be paid beyond that.    \n   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that roughly 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed each day of the shutdown.   Here's the latest breakdown on temporary furloughs during the government shutdown by agency.   Wildfire and other emergency response personnel, for example, will continue to work, but in many cases without pay.    In addition to furloughing employees, thousands of employees across several federal agencies began receiving RIF notices last week.   Last week, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown. When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, \"What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\"   Ian Morgan is a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland and the leader of a local federal worker union. He told WAMU's Jenny Abamu he wants any budget deal to include protections for federal workers and the services they provide. Morgan also wants Congress to guarantee back pay for federal contractors he works closely with — many of whom will not receive pay while the government is shut down.   Read more about how federal workers are finding their voice during the shutdown.       ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted   Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said.   Customs inspection and immigration law enforcement are considered \"essential\" functions that will continue during any lapse in appropriations, though workers may not get paid until the shutdown is over.   \n   The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a social media post from Secretary Kristi Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.   — Ximena Bustillo, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An air traffic control tower is seen following the government shutdown at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Oct. 1 in Austin, Texas.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   If you're flying soon …   Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job.   Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.    Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A \"slight increase\" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.   Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown from NPR's Joel Rose.      \n   The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country   Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.   Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:      Alaska   The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]   For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media.      \n   Arizona   Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ] Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU]Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ]Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]      California   The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]      Colorado   Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio]      Connecticut   Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. [WSHU]      Georgia   For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sentitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]      Kansas   Kansas farmers face several uncertainties, as payments from some federal programs are in limbo. In addition, nearly half of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's employees will be furloughed, and many offices will be closed. [KCUR]During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]   For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR.      Louisiana   The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]   For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF.      Illinois   Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]      Maine   Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it was a popular weekend at the park. [Maine Public]       Missouri   Families enrolled in the Missouri WIC program — which provides supplemental food, nutrition education and support to low-income women and children — will not be immediately impacted by the shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]      New Hampshire   There are more than 5,000 civilian federal employees in New Hampshire, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Manchester VA Medical Center, the White Mountain National Forest, the Berlin federal prison, the passport processing center at Pease and at other federal agencies. How the shutdown might affect them isn't entirely clear. [NHPR]The White Mountain National Forest will remain open, but some say earlier staff cuts are hampering critical activities. Firefighting and disaster response activities will also continue, according to federal officials. [NHPR]On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\" [NPR]   For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR.      North Carolina   After the federal government shutdown cut staffing and services at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, local governments and nonprofits in the region stepped up to foot the bill and keep the park open during the peak fall season. The funds should keep the park open through Oct. 19. [WUOT]      North Dakota   The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public]   For more on the impact in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public.      Oklahoma   With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story.⁠ [KOSU]      Oregon   The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB]      Pennsylvania   Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]      Tennessee   After the federal government shutdown cut staffing and services at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, local governments and nonprofits in the region stepped up to foot the bill and keep the park open during the peak fall season. The funds should keep the park open through Oct. 19 [WUOT]On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]      Texas   U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]      Utah   In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER)      Washington   On Oct. 6, state officials say they have enough to cover WIC for the next two weeks. Seattle and King County have partnered to dedicate nearly $2 million to provide one-time vouchers to an estimated 30,000 clients in King County who rely on WIC. [KUOW]The Employment Security Department says the 80,000 federal workers in Washington State may qualify for unemployment benefits. [OPB]      Wyoming   On Oct. 3, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wyoming will cover gaps in funding to federally funded state employees who are in the state budget \"in the short-term.\" [Wyoming Public Media]   For more on the impact in Wyoming, head to Wyoming Public Media.

Now that provision is in danger of being struck down, too.   Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act aims to ensure that minority voters are not shut out of the process of drawing new congressional districts.    When the law was passed in 1965, there were just six African American, four Hispanic and two Asian or Pacific Islander members of the House of Representatives. None of the identified representatives were from the Deep South.   \n   This Congress started out with 63 African American, 51 Hispanic and 21 Asian or Pacific-Islander representatives or delegates in the House.    Much of that change has been driven by the rules of the road under the Voting Rights Act.   All of that could change, however, if the court removes the guardrails to redistricting that it endorsed just two years ago. Indeed, if the Supreme Court either nullifies Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or makes it much more difficult to enforce, recent studies indicate that Democrats could lose as many as 19 congressional seats in the process, putting control of the House effectively out of reach for the foreseeable future.   \n   Specifically at issue in Wednesday's case is a 5-to-4 Supreme Court ruling from just 28 months ago, which  upheld the Voting Rights Act's framework for drawing new congressional district lines every 10 years.   That case was from Alabama, where the state had refused to create a second majority African American district until ordered to do so by the court.   Wednesday's case is from Louisiana and has a nearly identical fact pattern. African Americans comprise roughly 30% of Louisiana's voting population, but, of the state's six congressional districts, there is only one where they can, and do, routinely prevail in electing a candidate of their choosing.   \n   For years, the state legislature fought creating a second district where minority voters could win. But after the Supreme Court's decision in the Alabama case, the Louisiana legislature saw the legal handwriting on the wall and drew a new map that created a second district in which African American voters would have a realistic chance of electing the candidate of their choice.   Normally, that would have been the end of the case.   \n   District like \"a snake\"   But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" intervened to challenge the redistricting as racially discriminatory. And at the arguments last March, some of the conservative justices seemed to be having an attack of buyer's remorse.   Chief Justice John Roberts just over two years ago wrote the court's majority decision upholding the redistricting provision of the Voting Rights Act. But when the Louisiana redistricting case was argued last March, he sounded more than a little doubtful.   \"You think the drawing of this district was not predominantly based on race?\" asked the incredulous Roberts. \"It's a snake that runs from one end of the state to the other!\"   Louisiana's Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga replied that the Supreme Court has long said that partisan gerrymandering is permissible, but racial gerrymandering is not. And here, he said, the motivation was explicitly partisan. The lines, he said, were drawn to create a second minority district and to protect three key Republican incumbents in the House, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.   Pressed further, a frustrated Aguiñaga replied: \"It's an election year. We're talking about the speaker of the House. No rational state gambles with those high stakes in that situation.\"   \n   Request for reargument   Amazingly, however, the justices did not decide the case then. Instead, on the last day of the term, they ordered reargument in the case. Only this time they added this question: Does the state's intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violate the Constitution's 14th and 15th Amendments' guarantee of the right to vote, and the authority of Congress to enforce that mandate?   To answer that question, Louisiana has now flipped positions and instead of defending the map its legislatures drew, it is arguing that the redistricting provision of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutionally discriminatory.   \n   \"The jurisprudence keeps whipsawing us back and forth,\" said Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill. She maintains that the court's Alabama decision \"essentially boils down to, well, if you're engaging in remedial map drawing, you have to think about race, but you can't think about it too much. That is an impossible guideline.\"   But Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund will try to convince the justices that now is not the time to bail on the last truly effective provision of the Voting Rights Act.   If Section 2 is overturned, Nelson argued, \"it would be utterly devastating. It would allow for racial gerrymandering to happen with very few checks. But to be honest, as horrific, and utterly undemocratic as that result would be, more concerning is what it would mean in terms of this court's fidelity to what it once called the crown jewel of the civil rights movement.\"   \n   Just why the court ordered reargument in the case is unclear. There are a number of theories.   First, and most obvious, is that the fifth and decisive vote to uphold the provision two years ago was cast by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a concurring opinion, he said at the time that there should be some time limit to the redistricting provision. And it may be that he thinks that time has come.   A second possibility is that the court's decision upholding the voting rights law just two years ago was not as firm as it appeared. Indeed, court observers were surprised by the outcome, as Roberts has in the past consistently opposed the Voting Rights Act. And some have theorized that Roberts and Kavanaugh, the two conservatives in the majority, didn't want to rule against the voting law just weeks before the court struck down affirmative action in college admissions as unconstitutional.   \n   A third possibility is that the court was simply unable to reach a majority agreement late in the term, as it was being bombarded by dozens of cases filed by the Trump administration on the emergency docket.   Observers are watching to see what the court does this time.\n",

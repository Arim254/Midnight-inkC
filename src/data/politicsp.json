Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, declared victory in a closely watched Democratic primary special election to fill the U.S. House seat vacated by New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill. She credits her success to addressing national issues with New Jerseyans.   \"While my race was very much local — I was knocking on doors, I was making phone calls, I was at train stations — the discussions we were having were both local and national,\" Mejia told Morning Edition   Last Thursday, Mejia led by a narrow margin as polls closed in the district, and former congressman Tom Malinowski conceded earlier this week. Some mail-in ballots are still being counted, and the Associated Press has not yet made a call in the race.   \n   The crowded special primary race — one of the first elections in a year filled with midterm races — attracted national interest, as Democrats are trying to figure out the best way to win over voters and speak to their dissatisfaction with President Trump's second-term.   \"There is a national movement happening in our country,\" Mejia said. \"The American people can see that there is a democratic backslide. The American people can feel that our economy is leaving us behind. The American people also feel like our traditional politicians' response feels anemic — feels like we're not actually being heard.\"   Mejia concluded that the conversations she had with voters felt \"live\" for people, who want to hold elected officials accountable.

Mike Quigley of Illinois about DHS funding and ICE reforms ahead of Friday's deadline to avert a partial government shutdown.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois is part of this discussion. After the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, Quigley changed his mind about ICE, saying it could not be reformed and must be dismantled. Congressman, good morning.MIKE QUIGLEY: Good morning. Thanks for having me back.INSKEEP: What do you mean by dismantled? Are you in favor of abolishing ICE, as some people say?QUIGLEY: Look, I voted no on DHS funding for this, and I'll vote no again. Reforms are no longer enough to course-correct here. We have to dismantle ICE and start over, rebuilding an immigration enforcement agency from the ground up. We need people keeping the border secure, making sure drugs and people aren't tracked into the country and removing the worst of the worst criminals. But they're not doing that. We've seen the horrors and the terror of what they're doing. So I don't trust this agency. I think you dismantle them and you start anew with the original mission of the agency in place.INSKEEP: It seems likely that's not going to happen in this negotiation, so let's talk about the situation now. We just heard that Republicans seem to be on board with body cameras. There is some support for limiting these roving patrols. What else do you think is realistic to get out of this negotiation?QUIGLEY: You know, I think they shouldn't wear masks because what we've seen here is that there's no accountability when they're not mearing wasks (ph). But we've also seen police across the country wear ID, whether it's some sort of QR code. If they're worried about them being doxed, a QR code - you know, the agency and people will know who those are and not the general public. I mean, maybe that's a compromise. But look, there's just too much at stake here - protecting sensitive locations, stopping racial profiling. And then, again, we're not asking ICE to do anything that we don't ask of every police force in the country. They have to uphold the use-of-force standards. There should be some coordination with state and local officials. So that's not a lot to ask. That's all we've asked Chicago Police Department and every police department in the country.INSKEEP: I had not heard this idea previously that you're discussing about QR codes. I want to make sure I understand this. The idea is, instead of their name on the uniform, the agent has a QR code, and people who are standing around monitoring this with their phones can scan the QR code with the phone. And maybe they don't learn the agent's name, but they're able to report this specific person did this specific thing, and someone can investigate later. Is that what you mean to say?QUIGLEY: Look, you asked what the fallback might be. I don't think they should wear a mask. But I'm just saying this is how unreasonable they are. If there's some sort of QR code where the agency knows who they are and if something bad happens, as it's had happen all too often here, there is at least some way that we can find out who's responsible and someone can be held accountable. That's, at least, some way. I'm not suggesting that's the ideal. I'm suggesting - to answer the question, is there a way to compromise on this? Frankly, we're way past that. At this point in time, we've got to take this agency down and start anew with an agency who gets its mission and doesn't exceed it on a daily basis.INSKEEP: Sounds like you're going to be a no vote regardless on this DHS funding, but you're surrounded by other Democrats and Republicans. And in conversations, is it your sense that the deadline is going to be missed, that it is likely that DHS, the other parts of DHS, will shut down for a while?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I don't see any middle ground popping up right now. You know, when the president of the United States talks about, well, we've got to fund FEMA, and you have to be voting for this or you vote against FEMA, just a few months ago, he was talking about dismantling FEMA. Seems to forget that much of the reason that we need FEMA is his total disregard for climate change and the extreme weather events that we're experiencing. So the president's hypocrisy is showing here. I don't want to shut down any level of government. The irony is ICE has been so dramatically funded, you know, they won't be hurting in a shutdown. Their budget was tripled. And when they talk, again, about a lack of body...INSKEEP: Yeah.QUIGLEY: ...Cameras, they've got all the money in the world to buy what they need.INSKEEP: OK. Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois. Thanks very much for your insights. Really appreciate it.QUIGLEY: Thank you. Take care.INSKEEP: Have a good morning.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Johnson was charged in Florida after receiving a full pardon from President Donald Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n                \n                    Hernando County Sheriff's Office\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hernando County Sheriff's Office\n    \n\n   \n   A Florida handyman who received a pardon from President Trump for storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, has been convicted of multiple state charges of child molestation and exposing himself to children, prosecutors told NPR. Andrew Paul Johnson, the pardoned rioter, attempted to bribe one victim with money he claimed he would receive as part of restitution for Jan. 6 defendants, police reported. The conviction is the latest case of a pardoned Capitol rioter committing new crimes after receiving a pardon.   On Tuesday, a jury in Hernando County, Fla., found Andrew Paul Johnson guilty of five charges, including molesting a child under 12 and another under 16, as well as lewd and lascivious exhibition. Johnson was acquitted of one charge of sending sexual material to a child.   \n   William Forgie, the chief assistant state attorney for the fifth judicial circuit in Florida, told NPR in an email that Johnson \"faces up to life in prison\" when he is sentenced in March. An attorney for Johnson did not respond to a phone message seeking comment.   \n   A police report from the Hernando County Sheriff's Office filed as part of Johnson's Florida case describes a pattern of abuse — including both physical sexual abuse and exposing his genitalia to children — that took place \"over a many-month span.\" One of Johnson's victims was 11 years old at the time of the abuse.   Johnson also attempted to keep one victim quiet by claiming he would receive $10 million from the Trump administration as restitution for former Jan. 6 defendants and would share the money with the victim in his will, according to the police report. Convicted rioters and their supporters have advocated for financial reparations since Trump returned to office, though it's unclear if the administration will take that step.   In 2024, Andrew Paul Johnson pleaded guilty to nonviolent charges for entering the U.S. Capitol through a broken window during the Jan. 6 riot and then cursing at police officers trying to clear the area. Prosecutors said Johnson described himself on social media as an \"American Terrorist\" and \"Proud J6er,\" and that he violated court orders by posing with a gun while his case was ongoing.   \n   Chief Judge James Boasberg sentenced Johnson to one year in prison, in part due to Johnson's lengthy criminal history, including drug possession, driving under the influence and resisting arrest.   \n   Trump has described the more than 1,500 people charged for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack as \"patriots,\" and argued that they were treated unfairly by the justice system. \"These were peaceful people, these were great people,\" Trump said in 2021.   Just months after Johnson received his prison sentence, Trump pardoned him along with virtually every other Jan. 6 defendant.   The White House has not answered NPR's questions about whether the administration intends to provide compensation to people charged for their roles in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, though some Trump administration officials have promoted the idea in the past.   Johnson is one of several former Jan. 6 defendants who have faced additional legal trouble after receiving pardons from Trump. New charges filed against former defendants have included possession of child sexual abuse material and breaking and entering.   \n   Last week, Christopher Moynihan pleaded guilty in New York state court to a misdemeanor charge of harassment after he was accused of threatening to kill Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"I cannot allow this terrorist to live,\" Moynihan allegedly wrote in a text message. \"I will kill him for the future.\"   The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment.\n",

Mikie Sherrill.   \"I congratulate Analilia Mejia on her hard won victory in the NJ-11 special primary. I look forward to supporting her in the April general election,\" Malinowski said in a statement.   The Associated Press has not yet made a call in the race. Last Thursday, Mejia led by a narrow margin as polls closed in the district. Some mail-in ballots remain to be counted.    \n   The Democratic nominee will face Randolph Township Mayor Joe Hathaway, the only Republican to run, in the special general election to replace Sherrill. Sherrill resigned from her seat shortly after winning the gubernatorial race last November.   The special primary contest is one of the first elections in the 2026 midterm cycle where Democrats hope to capitalize on voter dissatisfaction with President Trump's second-term agenda. After losing the White House and the Senate in 2024, the party earned numerous victories in special elections and saw a surge of support in the 2025 November general election, including Sherrill's landslide victory.   Malinowski's comeback bid was supported by New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, who touted the two-term congressman's experience.   \n   \"Tom Malinowski knows the House of Representatives. He knows Congress. He knows New Jersey,\" Kim said in a video. \"He knows how to be able to stand up to Donald Trump, and that's what I need right now is someone there as a partner with me in the Capitol.\"   Malinowski represented a neighboring congressional seat from 2018-2022, but lost to Republican Rep. Thomas Kean Jr. after redistricting added more Republicans into his district.   Malinowski's prior experience in Congress was an important factor in the lead-up to this race, says Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.   \"With a short runway of a special election  — name recognition, money, experience — all can matter,\" he said.   \n   But Mejia, director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, was endorsed by several progressive groups and politicians including independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Locally, she received the endorsement of Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey's largest city.   \"In a moment of rising authoritarianism, of economic insecurity, of state-sanctioned violence, any old blue just won't do,\" Mejia said at the event with Sanders. \"If you send weak sauce to Congress, we will get weak sauce back.\"   \n   Mejia has also called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   \"You can't reform that. It's not fixable,\" she said at a January event at William Paterson University. \"Get it out. Kick it over. It is done. Forget it.\"   Immigration enforcement became a dominant theme of discussion among candidates in the primary, heightened by the fatal shootings of Nicole Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota.   The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll finds 65% of Americans feel that ICE has \"gone too far\" in enforcing immigration laws, with a growing number of independents and Democrats sharing that sentiment.   For his part, Malinowski faced attacks from a super PAC aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) over a 2019 vote for a bipartisan Department of Homeland Security funding bill. But he has been outspoken about the Trump administration's recent immigration tactics and a desire to \"defund ICE's brutality.\"   Earlier this month, Patrick Dorton, a spokesperson for the super PAC, United Democracy Project told The New York Times, \"Tom Malinowski is talking about conditioning aid to Israel,\" adding, \"That's not a pro-Israel position.\"   In the statement congratulating Mejia Tuesday, Malinowski decried the \"massive flood of dark money that AIPAC spent on dishonest ads during the last three weeks,\" adding that he supports Israel as a \"democratic and Jewish state.\"   In response to Malinowski's statement, AIPAC spokesperson Deryn Sousa said Tuesday that the organization \"will be very active this election cycle supporting Democrats and Republicans who strengthen the U.S.-Israel partnership and opposing those—of either party—who may seek to undermine it.\"\n",

President Trump and his allies sought unsuccessfully to overturn that election, pushing baseless claims of widespread fraud. Fulton County's 2020 ballots were counted three separate times, with the results affirmed.   The affidavit — written by FBI Special Agent Hugh Raymond Evans and unsealed Tuesday — led to a judge signing off on a search warrant of Fulton County's elections hub, just outside Atlanta. The FBI executed that search warrant on Jan. 28, seizing more than 650 boxes of ballots and other 2020 election materials.   \n   Yet the FBI's justification for seizing materials from more than five years ago relies on misleading claims of wrongdoing that were already investigated in detail by state law enforcement.    The claims largely align with allegations found in three cases presented to the Georgia State Election Board. Reports obtained by NPR show that investigators with the Georgia secretary of state's office found isolated examples of Fulton County election workers violating rules and procedures, but ultimately those errors did not affect the county's accurate tally.   \n   The FBI did not reach out to state investigators for copies of prior investigations, two sources familiar with the ongoing probe who were not authorized to speak publicly tell NPR.   The affidavit mentions some of the state's investigations, and that one case resulted in a letter of reprimand for the county, but omitted key details from the investigations, such as one conclusion that their \"findings do not affect the accuracy of the results of the 2020 General Election in Fulton County.\"   Republican Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who resisted Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, was critical of the probe. Raffensperger is now running for governor.   \"As Secretary of State, I've made Georgia the safest and most secure place to vote,\" he said in a statement. \"Instead of wasting time and tax dollars trying to change the past with baseless and repackaged claims, let's focus our efforts on building a safer, more affordable future for all hardworking Georgians.\"   \n   State investigators already debunked claims of \"defects\"   The FBI investigation, according to the affidavit, is focused on five alleged \"deficiencies or defects\" with the election and the subsequent tabulation: missing images of ballots, ballots that were scanned multiple times, inconsistent vote counts during a hand-count audit, ballots that could have been improperly inserted into the totals and changing vote totals during a machine recount.   Of the five, NPR's review of state investigative files found only one claim that was \"partially substantiated\" by law enforcement who are trained election investigators — that some batches of ballots were scanned twice during a Trump-requested recount.   But ultimately, a 2024 report reads, \"These investigative findings do not affect the accuracy of the results of the 2020 General Election in Fulton County, which were confirmed as accurate by both the [Risk-Limiting Audit] and the Recount.\"   \n   In that same case, investigators found that the individuals who filed the complaint — Joe Rossi and Kevin Moncla — used incorrect calculations and records not involved in tallying results to make claims about missing images and tabulator tapes and changing vote totals.   Rossi's complaint matches the description of a redacted Witness 1 in the affidavit, which highlights the fact that investigations were opened, but not the conclusion that almost all of the claims were unfounded.   State law at the time also did not require counties to maintain ballot images as records. A 2021 omnibus bill that made numerous changes to Georgia elections added a requirement that ballot images be made publicly available.    The Georgia State Election Board voted to issue a letter of reprimand to Fulton County in 2024 as a result of that state investigation.   Another report that investigated the hand count of Fulton County's election found that complaints about mismatched tallies of ballots misunderstood the purpose of the risk-limiting audit, which is to confirm the winner of the election, rather than an exact count of votes.   \n   \"A precise count of over 5 million ballots by human beings in 159 jurisdictions is impossible,\" the 2022 report reads. \"Humans counting will always produce errors. In Georgia, the difference was only 0.1053% in the number of votes cast and 0.0099% in the margin. These differences are well within the expected variances in a computer count vs. a hand count and further support the overall conclusion of the hand audit — that the initial reported result in the presidential contest in Georgia was correct.\"   \n   Investigators with the Georgia secretary of state's office wrote that \"these allegations, like so many, are well intentioned. That said, in nearly all of our investigations we are seeing the expected and normal degree of issues that occur due to human error in nearly every election.\"   Fulton County officials entered into a 2023 consent order with the State Election Board as a result of that case, in which the county promised to improve its audit process and both the state and county acknowledged there was no intentional misconduct and that errors did not affect the 2020 election result.   A final complaint was dismissed unanimously by the State Election Board in 2024 after an investigation found no evidence to support the claim that fraudulent ballots were found and counted in Fulton County — a claim that is included in last month's FBI affidavit.\"After interviewing all identified witnesses and reviewing identified batches of ballots, investigators could not substantiate the allegations of 'pristine\" ballots being counted during the risk-limiting audit,\" that report reads.   \n   In a statement, David Becker, a former Justice Department official who's now executive director of the Center for Election Information & Research, called the affidavit \"much weaker than I suspected.\"   \"After more than five years, dozens of court cases, and over a year in total control of the federal government, this is all they've got?\" he said. \"If taken at its word, this entire affidavit at most alleges human error after a late night during a global pandemic, all of which had no impact on the outcome of the race.\"   Trump-aligned lawyer behind FBI investigation   Additionally, the affidavit reveals that the FBI investigation was initiated by a lawyer working for the Trump administration who also aided Trump's efforts to try to overturn that election years ago.   \"This warrant application is part of an FBI criminal investigation into whether any of the improprieties were intentional acts that violated federal criminal laws,\" the affidavit reads. \"The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity.\"   \n   Olsen played an integral role in Trump's failed efforts to overturn his narrow 2020 election defeat by challenging the results in Georgia and other swing states.   The White House did not respond to NPR's questions Tuesday about Olsen's role in the administration.   The affidavit does not mention any evidence or suspicion of foreign election interference, raising more questions about the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the site of the raid.   In a letter to Democratic lawmakers last week, after the search, Gabbard defended her role in investigating election security. She also confirmed that she \"facilitated a brief phone call for the President to thank the [Atlanta-area FBI] agents personally for their work.\" The call was first reported by the New York Times. Gabbard said Trump \"did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives.\"   Trump and his allies have continued to focus on the 2020 election and falsely claim he was victorious while also taking extraordinary steps to exert federal control over future voting, including suing states to try to obtain unredacted voter rolls and suggesting that Republicans \"nationalize\" elections.\n",

In a blistering opening statement, ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., criticized the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files and the agency's treatment of survivors, highlighting that several were present in the hearing room. Raskin and Democrats on the panel have called for increased transparency, highlighting examples where they say redacted information in the documents benefits powerful individuals who may be implicated in Epstein's crimes, instead of omitting information that protects survivors.    \n   \"You're not showing a lot of interest in the victims, Madam Attorney General, whether it's Epstein's human trafficking ring or the homicidal governmental violence against citizens in Minneapolis,\" Raskin said, in reference to the two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by immigration officers in the city last month. \"You're siding with the perpetrators, and you're ignoring the victims,\" he added. \"That will be your legacy unless you act quickly to change course.\"   Throughout the hearing, Bondi defended the DOJ's handling of the files, touting the release of millions of documents. In her opening statement, she vowed to continue fighting for survivors, saying she was \"deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster.\"    However, as Democrats pressed her on the DOJ's handling of the Epstein investigation, Bondi pushed back, responding with personal attacks directed at lawmakers.    When asked by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., to apologize to survivors for the agency's \"absolutely unacceptable release of the Epstein files and their information,\" Bondi rejected that questioning.    \"I'm not going to get in the gutter for her theatrics,\" she said.   Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has largely broken with his party in criticizing the administration on the issue, demanded accountability for sharing survivor information while \"over redacting\" potentially incriminating information.    \n   Bondi responded by calling Massie a \"failed politician\" with \"Trump derangement syndrome,\" and asked whether the congressman demanded the same level of transparency from former Attorney General Merrick Garland during the Biden administration. Massie went on to reject that argument.    \"This cover-up spans decades, and you are responsible for this portion of it,\" he said.    Bondi's turbulent first year at DOJ    The attorney general's appearance before the committee comes one year into her tenure atop the Justice Department, a tumultuous period marked by a striking departure from the traditions and norms that have guided the department for decades.   Since taking the helm, Bondi has overseen the firing of career prosecutors and FBI officials who worked on Capitol riot cases or Trump investigations, investigated and prosecuted prominent opponents of the president, and dropped prosecutions of his allies.   The changes also extend to the department's workforce. The section that prosecutes public corruption has been gutted; the Civil Rights Division, which protects the constitutional rights of all Americans, has seen a mass exodus of career attorneys; and some U.S. attorney's offices — including most recently the one in Minnesota — have been hit by resignations.   In her public appearances, Bondi, who is a former Florida attorney general, has defended the department's actions and sought to tout what she says are major accomplishments — going after cartels and violent crime and helping in the administration's immigration enforcement.   She also says she's made \"tremendous progress\" toward ending what she says was the department's weaponization in recent years against Trump and conservatives. Biden-era DOJ officials deny they politicized the department, and they point to the prosecutions of prominent Democratic lawmakers and even President Joe Biden's son Hunter as evidence.   Accusations of politicization at DOJ   For decades, the Justice Department has enjoyed a degree of independence from the White House, particularly in investigations and prosecutions, to insulate them from partisan politics.   \n   Critics say that under Bondi, that independence has disappeared and the Justice Department has helped enact Trump's promised campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies.   Last year, for example, the president openly directed Bondi to go after former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James — two high-profile political adversaries of the president.   \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" Trump said in a social media post addressed to Bondi. \"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"   Days after that, a new acting U.S. attorney hand-picked by Trump secured an indictment against Comey, overruling career prosecutors who had doubts about the strength of the evidence.   A few weeks later, that same prosecutor secured an indictment against James.   Both cases have since been tossed by a federal judge, who found that the prosecutor was unlawfully appointed. The Justice Department is appealing that decision.   Other perceived opponents of the president or individuals standing in the way of his agenda have also found themselves under DOJ investigation, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former Obama-era intelligence officials James Clapper and John Brennan.   Despite the uproar from DOJ veterans and many legal experts, Bondi still enjoys Trump's support — publicly, at least — as well as the backing of Republican lawmakers.\n",

The National Governors Association meets in Washington, D.C., every year with this year's meeting scheduled for next week. The traditionally bipartisan event is an opportunity for governors to meet with the president and discuss issues affecting their constituents. It's usually followed by a formal dinner. This year, the Trump Administration only invited Republicans to the meeting and disinvited some Democratic governors from the formal dinner scheduled to follow.   \n   Maryland Governor Wes Moore is one of the two disinvited governors. Moore said the decision sent the same message as the president's recent refusal to apologize for posting a racist meme of the Obamas.   \"This message of disrespect — of his own personal feelings of supremacy — I think, are things that are just deeply unneeded reminders of just how unstable his leadership continues to be,\" Moore said.   White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the exclusions at a press briefing on Tuesday.   \"It's the people's house,\" Leavitt said. \"It's also the president's home. And so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   \n   Democratic leaders who were invited to the dinner have said they will skip the dinner. The National Governors Association said it won't \"facilitate\" events that don't include all governors, including next week's dinner.   Moore discussed the dinner and his state's redistricting with NPR's Michel Martin. This interview occurred before other Democratic leaders said they would skip the dinner and before Leavitt's press briefing.

On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.   \"If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.\"   \n   Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, told fellow governors in a letter on Monday that the White House intended to limit invitations to the association's annual business meeting, scheduled for Feb. 20, to Republican governors only.   \"Because NGA's mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program,\" Stitt wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.   The governors' group, which is scheduled to meet from Feb. 19-21, is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump has \"discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.\"   \"It's the people's house,\" she said. \"It's also the president's home, so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   Representatives for Sitt and the NGA didn't comment on the letter. Brandon Tatum, the NGA's CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an \"important tradition\" and said the organization was \"disappointed in the administration's decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.\"   \n   In his letter to other governors, Stitt encouraged the group to unite around common goals.   \"We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,\" he wrote. \"The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America's governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.\"   Signs of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine's Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.   \n   Trump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, \"We'll see you in court.\"   Trump then predicted that Mills' political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.   The back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year's conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.\n",

    "body": "\n      A contentious House hearing with senior immigration leaders did little to bring lawmakers closer on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The Department of Homeland Security faces a possible shutdown this weekend. Bipartisan talks have stalled over limiting President Trump's immigration enforcement agenda.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  And in a few minutes, we will hear from one of the Democrats involved in the negotiations, Representative Mike Quigley. First, we have some sounds from Capitol Hill. Lawmakers in the House called up to the people leading the president's immigration agenda yesterday, and here are the facts.MARTIN: NPR's immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo has been tracking all this, and she's with us now. Good morning, Ximena.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So tell us - who did we hear from, and what did they say?BUSTILLO: Officials from the three immigration agencies were on tap, all wanted to talk about how they were implementing President Trump's agenda, so that's reducing the number of people crossing at the southern border, increasing arrests and deportations and bringing more scrutiny to legal immigration. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons faced most of the questions, even though his agency is not the only one conducting immigration law enforcement. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow faced the fewest questions, even though his agency has leaned into policing tactics and reviewing the status of more immigrants.MARTIN: That's interesting. OK, so Democrats have been demanding that agents be equipped with body cameras, for agents to identify themselves and to use judicial warrants when they go into people's homes. Those are some of the demands, but those seem to be the main ones. Did those come up yesterday?BUSTILLO: Yeah. Republicans asked about body camera availability, and Lyons said that ICE only has 3,000 cameras for 13,000 officers, and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott noted that only half of 20,000 CBP officers have body cameras and not enough people to fully implement them. Here is Scott's plea to Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RODNEY SCOTT: So fund the entire program so that we can be transparent and that we can make sure America knows what we're doing because that trust is critically important.BUSTILLO: Lyons promised to release body cam footage of enforcement in Minneapolis as well. But Lyons also said that he would not ask his officers to remove their face coverings. Both Scott and Lyons said that that could result in doxing for their officers. Republicans generally are still opposed to mandating that officers remove their face masks.MARTIN: OK, so the two sides, the Republicans and Democrats, do seem to agree about body cameras, at least the importance of body cameras. So were there any other areas where the two parties seem to be on the same page about what has been happening and what should happen next?BUSTILLO: Both Democrats and Republicans suggested ICE may have gone too far in recent actions. For example, one Republican, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, said he believed, quote, \"roving patrols\" should be done at the border rather than in major cities of the United States. Ending these, quote, \"roving patrols\" is something Democrats also want. McCaul also applauded the leadership changes in Minneapolis, which removed border patrol commander Greg Bovino and sent in White House Border Czar Tom Homan to lead on-the-ground operations there. McCaul said this was, quote, \"returning to the original mission of ICE.\"MARTIN: OK. So at least one Republican seems to have some sort of alignment with the Democrats on these issues. So there is this funding deadline on Friday for the Department of Homeland Security. What could happen in the next few days?BUSTILLO: Well, all three are scheduled to be back on Capitol Hill on Thursday to do it all over again but this time before the Senate. I'm going to continue to keep an eye on what Republicans are asking for and how far apart the two parties are in their concerns. But if they can't come to an agreement, parts of DHS may see their funding slow down. Now, this would be particularly things like the Transportation Security Administration or disaster response. Now, border patrol and ICE got that infusion of cash last summer from Congress, so they can continue to dip into that and work and get paid, even if there is a shutdown to the agency.MARTIN: That is NPR's immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.BUSTILLO: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Democrats, and some Republicans, on the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday took the opportunity to criticize the tactics used by officers on the ground and the strategy of top Trump administration officials to curb illegal migration.   The criticism came as congressional funding is set to expire on Friday for the Homeland Security Department — the department that houses Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services.   \n   The hearing underscored how deeply divided Republicans and Democrats remain on top-level changes to immigration enforcement in the wake of the shootings. It suggested Congress is inching closer to another stopgap bill to fund the department in the absence of deeper agreement.   \n   Here are some other takeaways from the hearing:   1. Deaths of two U.S. citizens stay top of mind   Both Republicans and Democrats discussed the deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, the 37-year-olds killed by DHS officers in two separate incidents.   Rep. Andrew Garbarino, N.Y., the Republican chairman of the committee, called the deaths, as well as increased violent rhetoric generally, \"unacceptable and preventable.\"   \"The safety of law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect must always come first. When officials or elected leaders rush to conclusions about law enforcement, or their fellow Americans, public trust suffers,\" Garbarino said in his opening remarks, calling for a \"complete\" investigation.   \"I cannot put myself in the shoes of law enforcement, nor can I imagine what the families of Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti are enduring today,\" he said.   \n   But ICE acting Director Todd Lyons — who hasn't been confirmed by the Senate yet — deflected questions regarding the deaths. He said he would \"not comment on any ongoing investigations.\"   He also sought to deflect criticism of President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for labeling Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" saying as elected or appointed officials, \"that's their right to their comments.\"   But Lyons, in response to Democrats' questions, did emphasize that U.S. citizens shouldn't be caught up in immigration enforcement.   \n   \"ICE officers and special agents are trained in the Immigration and Nationality Act, so anyone that is here legally or lawfully or a US citizen should not be concerned about being deported or detained,\" Lyons said. He later drew a distinction between someone being \"arrested\" – which he acknowledged could happen to a U.S. citizen — and being \"detained\" on a longer basis.   NPR witnessed multiple instances in Minnesota where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people about their immigration status, with the state's attorney general saying U.S. citizens were detained.   The detention of U.S. citizens has also happened under prior administrations. A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found that over a five-year period, U.S. citizens had encounters with immigration officers that could lead to their arrest and even deportation.   2. Bipartisan questions about training and internal oversight   ICE and CBP officials broke down training and resources available to officers, in response to repeated questions about how officers are treating U.S. citizens and others.   Lyons said that officers undergo three months of training, which includes 47 days at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Academy in Georgia. Law enforcement officers and special agents who were certified in the past got to have a shorter training module, focused on just topics like the Immigration and Nationality Act.   \"They would have to go through the rigorous immigration training, which, unfortunately ... immigration law is just as confusing and long as [the] tax code,\" Lyons said.   \n   Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., asked Lyons how many ICE officers have been fired for their conduct. Lyons declined to comment on personnel matters.   But Lyons did denounce some of the language immigration officers were caught using on video. For example, in a video shared on social media after Pretti's death, an officer can be heard telling a woman: \"if you raise your voice, I will erase your voice.\"   When asked about the footage, Lyons said he hadn't seen it but said ICE \"does respect and adhere to the First Amendment\" and that the statement heard in the video \"doesn't represent the values of the men and women of ICE.\"   \n   3. Republicans share some concerns with Democrats   Republicans voiced concern about two issues that Democrats have frequently raised: roving patrols and the use of body cameras.   Under the second Trump administration, CBP, which houses the Border Patrol agency, has taken a leading role in enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country, rather than strictly near the borders.   \n   In response to widespread criticism of the events in Minneapolis, Trump removed Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino from serving as the public face of the immigration presence there, replacing him with White House border czar Tom Homan. Trump later said in an interview that \"maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch\" when it comes to immigration enforcement.   GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, Texas, said he believed \"roving patrols should be done at the border rather than in the major cities of the United States.\" He also applauded the leadership changes in Minneapolis as \"returning to the original mission of ICE.\"   Lawmakers from both parties have also pushed for greater use of body cameras to aid in oversight of agents' actions on the ground.   Lyons said that ICE had 3,000 cameras for 13,000 officers and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott noted that only half of 20,000 CBP officers have body cameras.   \n   Lyons pledged to Rep. Tony Gonzalez, R-Texas, that body camera footage of enforcement in Minneapolis would be released to the public and that he welcomes all officers getting such cameras.   Scott, from Customs and Border Protection, also pleaded for Congress to fully fund the body camera program for his agency, too, noting that while there has been money for the physical devices, there have not been the personnel to fully implement the body camera program.   \"So fund the entire program so that we can be transparent and that we can make sure America knows what we're doing, because that trust is critically important,\" Scott urged lawmakers.   \n   Noem, the homeland security secretary, has said the department is sending body cameras to every field officer in Minneapolis and that the body camera program would be expanded nationwide as funding allows.   Democrats want this codified into law.   \n   4. Most requests were still partisan   The rhetoric and questions still seemed largely split along partisan lines. Republicans described the work done by ICE as \"remarkable,\" while Democrats called for the \"abolishment\" and \"dismanteling\" of the agency.   Other Democratic proposals continue to face an uphill battle for GOP support, including calls for officers to display identifying information such as their last names on their uniforms, and to prohibit them from wearing face coverings.   Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., asked Lyons whether he would commit to unmasking his officers. Lyons said no. And Republicans argued that banning face masks would make it easier for people to dox federal agents — a common refrain from the administration.   \n   5. ICE was in the spotlight, while CBP, USCIS — and the looming shutdown — took a backseat   Both Republicans and Democrats peppered Lyons with questions about his agency's operations. But lawmakers generally did not drill down into the changes at CBP and USCIS, despite those agencies' growing roles in immigration enforcement over the last year.   Questions for CBP's Scott still centered around border enforcement. That comes even as the Border Patrol has gone beyond its traditional jurisdiction of 100 miles from U.S. borders to conduct enforcement in cities like Minneapolis, and lead operations in Illinois, North Carolina and Louisiana.   \n   All three agencies hedged  in response to questions about whether their operations would be affected if DHS shuts down on Friday.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow reminded lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   And ICE and CBP both got a huge infusion of cash from Congress in Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer — making ICE the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency.   \n   Lyons said the shutdown could affect the Department of Homeland Security's work related to transnational crime, but he did not note any impact to immigration operations. And Scott also didn't detail how the shutdown would affect personnel, just saying: \"I agree America becomes less safe.\"   Their responses suggest any lapse in funding could most affect non-immigration agencies inside the Department of Homeland Security, like the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency — potentially spelling trouble for U.S. air travel and disaster response.   —NPR's Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.\n",

The pause, effective immediately, is the latest step the administration has taken to hobble offshore wind in its push against renewable energy sources. It comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Donald Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, calling it unlawful.   The administration said the pause will give the Interior Department, which oversees offshore wind, time to work with the Defense Department and other agencies to assess the possible ways to mitigate any security risks posed by the projects.   \n   \"The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. \"Today's action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers.\"   The statement did not detail the national security risks.   Wind proponents slammed the move, saying it was another blow by the administration against clean energy.   \n   The administration said leases are paused for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.   The Interior Department said unclassified reports from the U.S. government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called \"clutter.\" The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of wind projects, the Interior Department said.   National security expert and former Commander of the USS Cole Kirk Lippold said the projects were awarded permits \"following years of review by state and federal agencies,\" including the Coast Guard, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Air Force and more.   \n   \"The record of decisions all show that the Department of Defense was consulted at every stage of the permitting process,\" he said, arguing that the projects would benefit national security because they would diversify the country's energy supply.   \n   The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.   Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.   Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump's Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.   Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.   \n   Wind supporters called the administration's actions illegal and said offshore wind provides some of the most affordable, reliable electric power to the grid.   \"For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country's need for electricity is surging,\" said Ted Kelly of the Environmental Defense Fund.   \"Now the administration is again illegally blocking clean, affordable energy,\" Kelly said. \"We should not be kneecapping America's largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity.''   The administration's actions are especially egregious because, at the same time, it is propping up aging, expensive coal plants \"that barely work and pollute our air,\" Kelly said.   The Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston-based environmental group, called the pause \"a desperate rerun of the Trump administration's failed attempt to kill offshore wind,'' noting that courts have already rejected the administration's arguments.   \n   \"Trying again to halt these projects tramples on the rule of law, threatens jobs and deliberately sabotages a critical industry that strengthens — not weakens — America's energy security,\" said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the law foundation.\n",

While Musk no longer leads DOGE, the idea of trimming the federal government remains.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Earlier this month, billionaire Elon Musk, the onetime DOGE leader and Trump adviser, sat down with Katie Miller on her podcast to reflect on his time with the administration.   He called DOGE's work \"a little bit successful\" but said he wouldn't do it again if given the chance.   \"We were somewhat successful, Musk said. \"I mean we stopped a lot of funding … that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful.\"   Musk left his role with DOGE in May after legal setbacks and clashes with Trump's cabinet.   Yet even as he retreated from Washington, the idea that slashing wasteful spending will lead to profound cuts to the nation's growing deficit remains central to the Trump administration's vision of a slimmed down bureaucracy.   \n   While many of DOGE's initial outsized promises to increase efficiency and slash spending never fully materialized, the Trump administration has not given up on those goals.   Here's a look back at some of what DOGE did and did not accomplish in its inaugural year and how the Trump administration is calibrating its tactics to make more incremental and less high-profile tweaks to federal agencies.   Shrinking the federal workforce    Agencies ordered to fire employees earlier in the year by DOGE were hiring back hundreds of workers ahead of the end of the fiscal year in September, while the Office of Management and Budget tried to lay off more people during the longest-ever federal government shutdown in October.    Still, by the end of 2025, some 317,000 federal employees will be out of the government, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some federal agencies and programs — like the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and much of the Education Department — have been effectively eliminated.   \n   Despite those reductions and a push to cut contracts and terminate leases, the federal government is still spending more money than it brings in.   Focus on slashing \"Democrat priorities\"   Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought is leading the push to streamline the federal workforce. Vought has long called for the federal government to have a smaller footprint, most recently including efforts to enact mass reductions-in-force at several agencies during the federal government shutdown that started in October and was blocked by the courts.   \n   Also during the shutdown, the Trump administration announced several rounds of funding cuts aimed at what the president called \"Democrat priorities\" like transportation and energy grants, continuing the trend of spending money on policies they like and removing funding from policies that Trump disagrees with.   Trump's priorities rely on the sharing of sensitive data   DOGE's push to consolidate sensitive personal data across federal agencies has survived legal challenges and been used for the administration's immigration enforcement priorities.   That includes the transformation of a federal citizenship verification database, demands for states to hand over information about federal food aid recipients and more. At least some of those efforts have wrongly flagged U.S. citizens, NPR has previously reported.   \n   Government restructuring efforts still exist   Even though the DOGE entity has not dominated the headlines in recent months since Musk departed the federal government, the focus of its work has not stopped.   Many of Musk's top allies and DOGE lieutenants have transitioned to become full-time employees at the agencies they were detailed to.   An Aug. 21, 2025 executive order signed by the president created the National Design Studio that aims to \"fill the digital potholes\" of the federal government's online systems and websites.   \n   The chief design officer in charge of this effort, Joe Gebbia, is an Airbnb cofounder and Musk associate who led DOGE's overhaul and digitization of the federal employee retirement system at the Office of Personnel Management.   The studio is responsible for the website for the new \"Trump Accounts,\" tax-advantaged investment accounts for U.S. children created under Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" signed earlier this year. Other projects include the Energy Department's \"Genesis Mission\" and the US Tech Force, a two-year program seeking \"an elite corps of engineers to build the next generation of government technology.\"   Federal spending still isn't reigned in   One of the stated reasons DOGE was created was to tackle the national debt, which grew more than $2.2 trillion from October 1, 2024 to Sept. 30, 2025 to more than $38 trillion.   That number is expected to grow by at least $3 trillion additional dollars in the next decade over baseline projections due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law earlier this year that includes tax cuts and new spending on Trump's priorities.   \"President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement provided to NPR.   The White House did not directly respond to NPR's questions about the government's deficit spending or the increase in the national debt.   From the start of the new fiscal year in October to the end of November, the federal government has spent nearly a half trillion dollars more than it has brought in, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That's slightly less than the same period last year.   The vast majority of federal spending — about 65% this fiscal year — goes toward Social Security, Medicare, health programs, income security and veterans' benefits and services. Another smaller percentage has been interest payments towards the country's debt, plus 14% for national defense.   \n   DOGE's work did not touch on these broadly popular programs that would require congressional action to change.\n",

Turning Point leader Erika Kirk, who took the helm after the assassination of her husband, Charlie Kirk, has endorsed Vance as a potential successor to President Donald Trump, a helpful nod from an influential group with an army of volunteers.   \n   But the tension on display at the four-day gathering foreshadowed the treacherous political waters that Vance, or anyone else who seeks the next Republican presidential nomination, will need to navigate in the coming years. Top voices in the \"Make America Great Again\" movement are jockeying for influence as Republicans begin considering a future without Trump, and there is no clear path to holding his coalition together.   Defining a post-Trump GOP   The Republican Party's identity has been intertwined with Trump for a decade, but he's constitutionally ineligible to run for reelection despite his musings about serving a third term. Tucker Carlson said people are wondering, \"who gets the machinery when the president exits the scene?\"   So far, it looks like settling that question will come with a lot of fighting among conservatives. The Turning Point conference featured arguments about antisemitism, Israel and environmental regulations, not to mention rivalries between leading commentators.   Ben Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, used his speech on the conference's opening night to denounce \"charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty.\"   \"These people are frauds and they are grifters and they do not deserve your time,\" Shapiro said. He specifically called out Carlson for hosting Fuentes for a friendly interview on his podcast.   \n   Carlson brushed off the criticism when he took the stage barely an hour later, and he said the idea of a Republican \"civil war\" was \"totally fake.\"   \"There are people who are mad at JD Vance, and they're stirring up a lot of this in order to make sure he doesn't get the nomination,\" he said. Carlson described Vance as \"the one person\" who subscribes to the \"core idea of the Trump coalition,\" which Carlson said was \"America first.\"   Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet framed the discord as a healthy debate about the future of the movement, an uncomfortable but necessary process of finding consensus.   \"We're not hive-minded commies,\" he wrote on social media. \"Let it play out.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Supporters cheer during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest 2025, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025, in Phoenix.\n                \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jon Cherry/AP\n    \n\n   \n   If you love America, you're welcome in the movement, Vance says   Vance acknowledged the controversies that dominated the Turning Point conference, but he did not define any boundaries for the conservative movement besides patriotism.   \"We don't care if you're white or black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between,\" he said.   Vance didn't name anyone, but his comments came in the midst of an increasingly contentious debate over whether the right should give a platform to commentators espousing antisemitic views, particularly Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as working to preserve America's white, Christian identity. Fuentes has a growing audience, as does top-rated podcaster Candace Owens, who routinely shares antisemitic conspiracy theories.   \"We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,\" he said.   Vance ticked off what he said were the accomplishments of the administration as it approaches the one-year mark, noting its efforts at the border and on the economy. He emphasized efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies, drawing applause by saying they had been relegated to the \"dustbin of history.\"   \n   \"In the United States of America, you don't have to apologize for being white anymore,\" he said.   Vance also said the U.S. \"always will be a Christian nation,\" adding that \"Christianity is America's creed, the shared moral language from the Revolution to the Civil War and beyond.\"   Those comments resonated with Isaiah White-Diller, an 18 year-old from Yuma, Arizona, who said he would support Vance if he runs for president.   \"I have my right to be Christian here, I have my right to say whatever I want,\" White-Diller said.   Turning Point backs Vance   Vance hasn't disclosed his future plans, but Erika Kirk said Thursday that Turning Point wanted Vance \"elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible.\" The next president will be the 48th in U.S. history.   Turning Point is a major force on the right, with a nationwide volunteer network that can be especially helpful in early primary states, when candidates rely on grassroots energy to build momentum. In a surprise appearance, rapper Nicki Minaj spoke effusively about Trump and Vance.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nicki Minaj speaks during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest 2025, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025, in Phoenix.\n                \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jon Cherry/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Vance was close with Charlie Kirk, and they supported each other over the years. After Kirk's assassination on a college campus in Utah, the vice president flew out on Air Force Two to collect Kirk's remains and bring them home to Arizona. The vice president helped uniformed service members carry the casket to the plane.   Emily Meck, 18, from Pine City, New York, said she appreciated Vance making space for a wide variety of views.   \"We are free-thinkers, we're going to have these disagreements, we're going to have our own thoughts,\" Meck said.   Trump has spoken highly of both Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, even suggesting they could form a future Republican ticket. Rubio has said he would support Vance.   Asked in August whether Vance was the \"heir apparent,\" Trump said \"most likely.\"   \n   \"It's too early, obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favorite at this point,\" he said.\n",

MAGA Marxism. Crony capitalism.   Those are just some of the terms business and political commentators have used this year to describe how President Trump's policies are reshaping U.S. free-market capitalism. There are some differences in definition — but all of these terms underline how dramatically Trump has blurred the boundaries between business and government, to an extent that could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy and the country's global standing.   \n   \"When the American government appears to favor a company over rival companies, that distorts the marketplace,\" says Ann Lipton, a veteran business law expert and professor at University of Colorado's law school.   \"It means that other firms have less incentive to compete on innovation, which is sort of the opposite of how a free market is supposed to operate,\" she adds. \"It's just bad for the economy.\"   There's ample evidence this year of Trump actively favoring some U.S. companies and investors, while threatening others. In August, he publicly called for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan — until Tan came to the White House to meet with him, and agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in the tech company.   \n   Several other tech CEOs also spent the year appearing to personally court Trump. Take Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who runs the world's most valuable company and is among the donors funding Trump's controversial plans to build a White House ballroom. This month, Trump said the U.S. would grant Nvidia permission to sell one of its more advanced semiconductor chips in China — as long as the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of sales.   \n   Lipton calls this capitalism by \"schmoozing,\" and warns that it could seriously damage the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, thus hurting the overall economy in the long term.   \"We're not going to get the best innovations. We're not going to get the best products,\" she says. \"If [businesses] are competing on their ability to schmooze, then that's bad for everybody.\"   Intel did not respond to an NPR request for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, \"In our discussions, President Trump focuses on his desire for America to win as a nation and his efforts to protect national security, American prosperity and technology leadership.\"   China-style 'state capitalism'   Business leaders have always spent some amount of time trying to cozy up to the White House, no matter its occupant. But Lipton and business insiders across the political spectrum say that Trump's direct influence over private companies this year — and the degree to which some of those companies and their leaders have sought to appeal to him personally — is pushing the U.S. economy away from free-market or \"rules-based\" capitalism.   \n   This system, traditionally embraced by both businesses and Republicans, has helped make the United States into the dominant global economy.   But now, these business insiders say, Trump's policies are creating a government-controlled style of \"state capitalism,\" in which the government — rather than competition between private businesses — shapes the economy. Some go so far as to call it \"crony capitalism,\" meaning that the U.S. government picks winners and losers based on the president's personal relationships.   \"We are seeing a shift away from the type of rules-based capitalism that has made America's economy so robust for so long. And there's a lot of risk in that,\" says Daniella Ballou-Aares, who co-founded the consulting firm Dalberg and served in  President Obama's State Department. She now runs the Leadership Now Project, a coalition of business leaders that has endorsed candidates from both political parties.   \n   In October, her group and The Harris Poll surveyed business leaders across the political spectrum — and found that 84% are worried \"about the current political and legal climate's impact on their companies.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang listens as President Trump speaks at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November in Washington, D.C. Nvidia has spent the year seeking the U.S. government's approval to sell more of its semiconductor chips in China.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says \"this narrative about how [President Trump] reshaped capitalism is significantly overstated\" and calls Trump's policies by and large \"the traditional free-market policy-making that you would expect coming out of a Republican Administration.\"   The official dismissed claims that the White House is engaging in \"crony capitalism,\" and says \"there are companies that are benefiting [from Trump's policies] whether or not they have a good relationship with the administration.\"   The official also notes that so far, the U.S. government has largely sought to take ownership stakes or revenue-sharing deals from companies that play a role in economic and national security: For example, Intel and Nvidia both sell the semiconductors at the center of the artificial-intelligence arms race with China. The U.S. government has also taken stakes or other interests in U.S. Steel and MP Materials, a rare-earth minerals mining company, among others.   \n   \"What we're trying to do is very much embracing the free market and the growth that it unleashes, but making targeted interventions where there's too much on the line,\" the official says.   Tech winners vs. everyone else in corporate America   Businesses largely welcomed President Trump's victory in last year's election, in part due to frustration with what they perceived as a harsh and \"anti-business\" regulatory climate under President Biden.   And some seem pretty happy with his first year in office — especially the tech billionaires whose \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are powering the A.I. boom.   \"The Magnificent Seven and Trump 2.0 are really on the same page to a large extent,\" says Daniel Kinderman, a political science professor at the University of Delaware who studies what he calls \"authoritarian capitalism\" and business responses to right-wing movements.    Some of President Trump's policies, including his sweeping tariffs and his changes to immigration policies for highly-skilled foreign workers, have complicated the business of Big Tech. But most tech CEOs have tried to avoid criticizing those policies publicly, and instead focused on donating to Trump's personal projects. Apple's Tim Cook, for example, this summer presented Trump with a gold-plated and glass plaque as his company promised to invest $600 billion in the United States.    Such gifts appear to have helped: Apple's iPhones have escaped the worst of Trump's tariffs.   Apple did not respond to a request for comment.   Kinderman points out that for wealthy and powerful CEOs, Trump's degree of personal involvement in their businesses at least makes it efficient to deal directly with him — if they can keep him happy — instead of wading through the slow and complicated red tape of federal regulatory processes.   \"These companies are a huge portion of the American economy,\" he says. \"And I think Trump is also giving them, to a large extent, what they want.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In August, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented President Trump with a gold-plated and glass plaque, as his company pledged to invest a total of $600 billion in the United States.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Still, he and others warn that, taken to the extreme, codependent relationships between political leaders and CEOs don't always end well for the latter.   \n   In more authoritarian countries, where leaders exert much more control over private businesses, the stakes can be especially fraught. Russia, Hungary, and China all exercise some form of state-controlled capitalism, where an autocratic leader cultivates relationships with oligarchic business CEOs — and can quickly force them out of favor.   As one extreme example, Ballou-Aares invokes Jack Ma, the Alibaba founder who built one of China's biggest tech companies before criticizing the country's financial regulations … and then largely disappearing from public view for several years.   \"We know that crony capitalism never really ends well for most companies,\" she says. \"I mean, tell Jack Ma that autocracy is okay for business.\"   'Most CEOs are pretty frustrated'   Outside of Big Tech, many businesses feel a lot more conflicted about how President Trump is reshaping U.S. capitalism. Some have even filed lawsuits against the administration, over its tariffs and its immigration policies.   \"Despite the handful of tech titans that do seem to admittedly genuflect at the White House and at Mar-a-Lago, most CEOs are pretty frustrated with what's happening,\" says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor who regularly speaks with CEOs.    Pockets of frustration from corporate America have become more visible recently. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the administration over its plans to start charging $100,000 for H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers — although it did so while praising Trump's \"ambitious agenda.\"   \n   And JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon, who runs the country's largest bank and is one of the most prominent non-tech CEOs in the country, recently told CNN why his company had declined to donate to Trump's White House ballroom.   \"Since we do a lot of contracts with governments here and around the world, we have to be very careful about how anything is perceived,\" Dimon said. \"We're quite conscious of risks we bear by doing anything that looks like buying favors or anything like that.\"   \n   That said, most businesses are reluctant to publicly criticize President Trump or his policies. Smaller companies lack the power to effectively stand up to the White House. And even those running the country's biggest companies are unwilling to draw the personal attacks that Trump can often wield, or the ensuing partisan boycotts and financial damage that can follow.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Earlier this month, demolition work continued where the East Wing once stood at the White House. President Trump ordered the East Wing and Jacqueline Kennedy Garden leveled to make way for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom that he says will be paid for with private donations from companies including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Many businesses have neither the appetite nor the capacity to take on the U.S. government. They just want to focus on making money, even if that means adapting to dramatic tariffs or other sharp shifts in government policy.   \"It's tactical fire-fighting,\" says Drew DeLong, who advises businesses around the world as head of corporate statecraft for the consulting company Kearney, and who served in the State Department during Trump's first administration.   \"Every moment and every hour you spend on tariff mitigation is one less hour that you spend on innovation,\" he says. \"There is an urgency towards fire-fighting as best as they possibly can, but there's also a fatigue.\"   'Merger review has been weaponized'   The Trump Administration's approach to approving — or not — corporate mergers has drawn some of the highest scrutiny, because of the nexus of political and business issues at stake.   \n   For example, the Federal Communications Commission this year approved several telecommunications mergers only after Verizon and T-Mobile agreed to terminate internal policies around \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" or DEI. Then it threatened to take federal action against some ABC affiliates over Jimmy Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's killing on his ABC late-night show; the owners of some of those stations were also seeking federal approvals for mergers. (ABC parent Walt Disney suspended Kimmel's show for almost a week, before reinstating him. ABC did not respond to requests for comment.)   \"Merger review has been weaponized into a tool for control,\" says Elizabeth Wilkins, the former chief of staff to Lina Khan, who oversaw U.S. merger review as chair of President Biden's Federal Trade Commission.   \n   \"With those kinds of tools hanging over corporate leaders' heads, we have seen an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear — which breeds silence,\" adds Wilkins, who now runs the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.   The exception is, again, for leaders who cultivate close ties with the president. This year, the White House helped broker a deal for a coalition of U.S. investors to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok — and asked for an unusual multibillion-dollar payment to the federal government, which business experts have compared to a \"shakedown\" or \"extortion.\" Some of those same investors, including Trump ally Larry Ellison and his son, David, are now seeking even more media deals.   Some business experts say now that corporate America has a better idea of President Trump's playbook in this administration, they expect to see companies and their executives feel more confident about how and when to push back against White House policies that they think will damage their businesses and the wider economy.   \"I think it is clear that the administration's approach here is broadly unpopular, including with business,\" says Ballou-Aares.   But Kearney's DeLong, the veteran of Trump's first administration, warns businesses to brace for much more policy change, and uncertainty about what capitalism and the economy will look like in the future.   \"This is just year one,\" he says. \"Where do we go [during] the rest of this administration? Where do we go after?\"\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Representative Adam Smith, Democratic leader of the House Armed Services Committee, says President Trump's move to block Venezuela's sanctioned oil shipments is aimed at driving President Nicolás Maduro from power, not enforcing maritime law.   \"This is about regime change in the conflict with Venezuela, much more than it's about trying to enforce international laws against false flag vessels or dark fleet vessels,\" Smith told Morning Edition.   His comments come as the Department of Homeland Security says the U.S. Coast Guard is pursuing an oil tanker that has recently departed from Venezuela, the third oil-carrying vessel pursued this month off the country's coast. Two ships have already been seized.   \n   The move follows President Donald Trump's announcement last week to put a \"total and complete blockade\" against Venezuelan oil and sanctioned tankers. Trump said more military pressure would come \"until they return to the United States of America, all of the oil, land and other assets that Venezuela stole from us.\"   Venezuela denies that it has stolen from the U.S. and says Trump is after the country's natural resources, including its vast oil reserves.

She was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs from 2001 to 2005. That would be the Bush administration. She was the top diplomat for Central Europe at that time. That period saw the largest ever expansion of NATO. She's now a non-resident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, which is a think tank. Welcome to the program.HEATHER CONLEY: Great to be with you, Steve. Happy Holidays.INSKEEP: Thank you, and same to you. Do you detect any movement whatsoever in these negotiations?CONLEY: No. There was no breakthrough, clearly. And both sides are trying to keep the United States on their side. So you can clearly see work with Ukrainians and the Europeans to keep the plan from not being one-sided towards Russia. And then you saw the U.S.-Russia dimension trying to keep the United States more in Russia's camp and vision of things. So more alignment than breakthrough.INSKEEP: When I think about the United States reaching out to Russia again and again and again - this comparison is not exactly right, but I think about myself as a journalist, I reach out to officials, and some of them, of course, come on the program and some of them don't come on the program. And once in a while, I get a spokesman who's like, I'm very professional. I'm always going to get back to you. And the answer is always going to be no. I mean - I'm feeling that that's what the response the United States is getting from Russia. They come back with the same position again and again and again.CONLEY: One hundred percent. And it's because Vladimir Putin has been so clear and consistent from the very beginning. This is really not just simply about negotiating a peace deal. He wants to address what he calls the root causes. And the root causes for him was what his view is the greatest geostrategic catastrophe of the 20th century, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the enlargement of NATO. And he wants to redo that. So this is so much bigger. Of course, Ukraine plays the critical point of that plan. So this is all about addressing Russia's grievances from 30 years ago.INSKEEP: Meaning that there is no territorial swap, no line you could draw that gives them part of Ukraine but leaves an independent Ukraine that would ever be acceptable to Russia so far as we know.CONLEY: So, I mean, this, again, gets back to the international system that we want. So we are - the United Nations bases on territorial integrity and sovereignty. One nation cannot decide that it's, you know, it doesn't believe the other has validity. And so this is about reassuring territorial integrity, of which Vladimir Putin, in 1994, acknowledged Ukraine's current, you know, internationally recognized boundaries. So it's not restoration of historic lands 'cause we start getting into that business, and the international system is absolutely going to be highly unstable.INSKEEP: Do you see any usefulness in the effort here if it does ultimately prove that Russia doesn't want anything except war, which makes it easier for the United States to stay on the same side as its European allies?CONLEY: So again, many times, the Russians take actions. They continue to push boundaries, probe weaknesses and they trip into things that they shouldn't. You can think about the Novichok poisoning in the United Kingdom.INSKEEP: Yeah.CONLEY: And I think this always sort of returns Europe and the United States to understanding truly what Russia's hybrid warfare - excuse me - and its aggression, how highly unstable it is. Look, war is happening - excuse me - in Europe. It's happening through hybrid warfare, which we're only seeing intensifying.INSKEEP: I've just got about 30 seconds left, but suppose President Trump called you up and said, fine, you don't seem to be impressed with my negotiating efforts. What's your advice? What would your answer be to the president in that case?CONLEY: Continue to pressure Russia economically and militarily. Continue to work closely with your European allies. Support Ukraine because restoring territorial integrity restores the stability of the international system, and that is great for the United States.INSKEEP: Heather Conley is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, now at the American Enterprise Institute. Thanks so much for getting up early.CONLEY: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Division over the future of the Republican Party were on display this weekend as conservatives gathered for Turning Point USA's \"AmericaFest\" conference in Phoenix, Arizona.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Turning Point USA's annual conference this weekend featured four days of speeches from some of the most prominent figures in the MAGA movement and exposed some underlying rifts in the Republican Party. The event was the organization's biggest gathering since its founder, Charlie Kirk, was assassinated in September. NPR political reporter Elena Moore was at AmericaFest in Phoenix and joins us from there now. Good morning, Elena.ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: So what does this event tell us about the state of the GOP?MOORE: That some of its loudest voices are clashing. On one hand, the GOP has really rejected this idea of cancel culture. But at the same time, this conference highlighted a pretty large debate within the MAGA movement about which kinds of voices are being amplified. And there was this really notable moment on the first night when conservative commentator Ben Shapiro criticized a bunch of right-wing media personalities, including Tucker Carlson for his recent interview with the white nationalist Nick Fuentes. And that's someone who's praised Hitler and someone that Kirk himself didn't support.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BEN SHAPIRO: He knew that Nick Fuentes is an evil troll and that building him up is an act of moral imbecility. And that is precisely what Tucker Carlson did. He built Nick Fuentes up.MOORE: And Carlson spoke later that night, and he didn't address Shapiro specifically but told the crowd that antisemitism is immoral. And he said he was surprised, frankly, that there were calls for deplatforming and denouncing people at a Charlie Kirk event.FADEL: Now, President Trump has repeatedly headlined Turning Point events in the past, but at this one, it was Vice President JD Vance who gave the closing speech. What was his message?MOORE: Well, notably, Vance didn't directly weigh in on this debate over antisemitism. But he did say that the GOP is open to folks of all backgrounds, saying that as long as they love America, they have a home inside the America First movement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JD VANCE: We have far more important work to do than canceling each other. We have got to build.MOORE: You know, and like you mentioned, President Trump is often the headliner. So having Vance step into that role is a shift, and it comes at a crucial moment. Over the past decade, many factions of this party were really unified by their collective support for Trump. And now the next generation of Republicans is grappling with how they want to move forward as the party stares down a challenging midterm in 2026, and many are counting on Turning Point to help with that.FADEL: OK. And that gets us back to the future of this organization...MOORE: Right.FADEL: ...Kirk's organization. What did this conference suggest about how Turning Point is navigating without him?MOORE: For one, this was the first conference since his widow, Erika Kirk, took over as CEO. And she says she plans to carry out her husband's work of getting more young people engaged with conservative and Christian beliefs. And as Republicans court the youth vote, Turning Point has become an influential force. Erika Kirk says it's now got a network of more than 1 million students, and the group is already kind of eyeing their possible role in 2028. I mean, case in point - on the first night of the conference, Erika Kirk threw her support behind Vance if he does indeed decide to run for president in 2028.FADEL: OK. And how did all this sit with the young people who attended?MOORE: I mean, a lot of young voters I talked to said that they felt compelled to show up to this year's conference to honor Kirk. But some, like 25-year-old Angie Perez (ph), also found the party infighting to be counterproductive.ANGIE PEREZ: If we're divided, then the Democrats, the liberals can get an upper hand on that. And we're just here bickering with - you know, amongst each other. And that's not going to do anything for us.MOORE: But, you know, the supporters I talked to are still pretty broken up about losing Kirk, and Perez got pretty emotional as she talked about it with me. She told me that Kirk was her hero.FADEL: That's NPR political reporter Elena Moore reporting from Phoenix. Thank you, Elena.MOORE: Thanks, Leila.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Some lawmakers said the department's release of files relating to Jeffrey Epstein had too many redactions as well as missing information.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Two lawmakers are threatening a seldom-used congressional sanction against the Department of Justice over what they say is a failure to release all of its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by a deadline set in law.   Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie spearheaded the effort to force the Epstein files' release by co-sponsoring the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but both have said the release had too many redactions as well as missing information.   \n   \"I think the most expeditious way to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday. \"Basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.\"   Inherent contempt refers to Congress' authority to fine or arrest and then bring to trial officers who are obstructing legislative functions. It was last successfully used in the 1930s, according to the American Bar Association.   Khanna, a California Democrat, noted that the House would not need the Senate's approval to take such action, which he said would result in a fine for Attorney General Pam Bondi.   \"I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable,\" he told Face the Nation.   Justice Department defends partial release   The Justice Department on Sunday defended its initial, partial release of documents, some of which were heavily redacted.   \"The material that we released on Friday, or the material that we're going to release over the next a couple of weeks, is exactly what the statute requires us to release,\" said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on NBC's Meet the Press, referring to the Epstein Files Transparency Act.   \n   Blanche said the administration has hundreds of lawyers going through the remaining documents to ensure that victims' information is protected. Still, lawmakers from both parties remain unsatisfied.   \"Any evidence or any kind of indication that there's not a full reveal on this, this will just plague them for months and months more,\" said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on ABC's This Week. \"My suggestion would be — give up all the information, release it.\"   Blanche told NBC he was not taking the threats of contempt seriously.   \n   \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on,\" he said, adding that lawmakers who have spoken negatively about Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \"have no idea what they're talking about.\"   Back and forth over Trump photo   The trove of documents released Friday contained little new information about Epstein, prompting accusations that the department wasn't complying with the law. There was a photograph included in Friday's release that showed a desk full of photos, including at least one of President Trump. It was among more than a dozen photographs no longer available in the Justice Department's \"Epstein Library\" by Saturday, NPR found.   \n   On Sunday, the Justice Department re-uploaded the photo of the desk, and provided an explanation on X.   \"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the post read. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"   The Justice Department did not offer an explanation for the other photos whose access had been removed.   Blanche told NBC the Justice Department was not redacting information around Trump or any other individual involved with Epstein. He said the Justice Department had removed photos from the public files \"because a judge in New York has ordered us to listen to any victim or victim rights group, if they have any concerns about the material that we're putting up.   \n   \"And so when we hear concerns, whether it's photographs of women that we do not believe are victims, or we didn't have information to show that they were victims, but we learned that there are concerns, of course, we're taking that photograph down and we're going to address it,\" he said.   Earlier Sunday, the Justice Department also posted to X a new version of the 119-page transcript of grand jury proceedings in the case of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The original version had been entirely redacted.   \n   \"Here is the document now with minimal redactions. Documents and photos will continue to be reviewed consistent with the law and with an abundance of caution for victims and their families,\" the Justice Department wrote in its post.\n",

    "body": "\n      Entrepreneur, political strategist and philanthropist Bradley Tusk argues his new online voting tech could revolutionize participation in American elections. Through his organization, the Mobile Voting Project, he wants to make online voting a reality — even at a time when much of the election establishment thinks that is a very bad idea.   \n\n    MILES PARKS, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Miles Parks. As NPR's voting correspondent, I can tell you, President Trump and election experts agree on very few things. But paper ballots are one of them.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's called watermark. It's impossible to copy, impossible to cheat. It's actually hard to believe that a piece of paper is highly sophisticated. But it's watermark, and it's very - it's amazing, actually, when you see it. You can't cheat.PARKS: Voting officials also say paper ballots give the public a way to double check results using the actual physical votes that were cast. Here's how former New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner put it a few years ago.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL GARDNER: See this pencil here? Want me to give it to you and see if you can hack this pencil? This is how people vote in this state, and you can't hack this pencil.PARKS: But nearly 80% of Americans don't participate in primary elections. Bradley Tusk is convinced there's a better way. Tusk is a venture capitalist and political strategist who is now hell-bent on making online voting a reality, even at a time when much of the election establishment thinks it's a bad idea. Tusk's organization, the Mobile Voting project, is pushing a major technology makeover for American democracy. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.BRADLEY TUSK: Hey, Miles. Thanks for having me.PARKS: Yeah, thanks for being here. So you have been pushing for years to move towards holding elections via smartphone. The front page of the Mobile Voting project website says, fix our broken politics, vote with your phone. How would voting with your phone actually change everything?TUSK: To me, the biggest problem we face in our politics is polarization. It is really hard for our politicians to work together to compromise and solve problems because they are typically answering to the small groups of people who vote in their primaries. Because of gerrymandering, typically the only election that really matters is the primary, and primary turnout is very low. It's usually around 10%, and those voters tend to be the people at the extremes, whether it's the far right or the far left, or very special interests that know how to move money and votes in low turnout elections. And because politicians really want to get reelected above anything else, I mean, order to do so, they have to satisfy that 10% who actually vote in their primaries, which means being completely pure to the ideology rather than working across the aisle to get things done.If you had higher turnout, that would become a lot easier. If turnout were 30 or 40% in a primary instead of 10, that is so much more representative of the mainstream that the underlying political incentives for our elected officials shift towards working together and getting things done. So I think the only way to change and end the polarization is to have meaningfully higher turnout. And the only way to do that, especially for state and local elections where people just aren't that focused, is to bring voting to where the people are and where they live their lives, and that's on their phone.PARKS: Do you have any sense of how voters feel about that? I mean, I guess I just wonder about the average American if they would be open to this sort of change.TUSK: Sure. We've polled this a bunch of times in different places. And what's interesting is before 2020, the results were very consistent across Democrats, independents and Republicans where about 75% said, yes, if it is secure, we should have this. After 2020, we stayed in the mid-70s with independents and Democrats but then fell into the 40s with Republicans because Trump falsely arguing that he was - you know, the election was stolen from him in 2020, but that did resonate with a lot of Republicans. There are individual groups of people for whom voting tends to be harder and they are particularly supportive. So that could be people in rural areas, deployed military, people with disabilities, Gen Z. We have a lot of support in the civil rights community because a lot of the leaders think that mobile voting is the best anti-voter suppression tool out there. So there are specific groups of people.But overall, you know, I ask groups, like, hey, who voted in their last state Senate primary? If they're being honest, almost no one raises their hands. And then when I say, OK, if you could do it while you're waiting for your coffee or you're sitting on the bus or whatever it is, how many of you would then consider doing it? And then pretty much everyone raises their hands. So even if we went from 10% turnout to 35, it would radically change the composition of the electorate and the underlying political incentives. And so I think that that's very feasible in a world where we already do our banking on our phones, or health care on our phones. I just think we're so used to it that it wouldn't be a hard transition.PARKS: Can I just ask how much money have you put into, at this point, this project?TUSK: I've put over $20 million of my own money into this so far.PARKS: Wow.TUSK: I should be clear this is totally philanthropic. This is not in any way, shape or form a business. I'm spending it to hopefully try to fix democracy. One other point that I just should make just in case it's not clear, mobile voting is not meant to replace any form of voting. We should just have every form available possible. And yeah, in 20 years, could it be that, you know, mobile voting is basically what everyone uses? Sure.PARKS: Well, and I think - when you were talking about the polling that you all have done on this, I think the key phrase is, if it's secure, if people feel like it's secure, right? I know that you guys just announced a pretty major development or something that you guys are calling a milestone in internet voting technology. Can you explain this new thing that you rolled out?TUSK: Yeah, absolutely. And to be clear, if it's not secure, of course we shouldn't have it. I wouldn't want it either. So the way it works is - I'll use myself as the example here. I download the New York City Board of Elections app. The first thing they would say is, OK, is there someone named Bradley Tusk who lives in New York City? I would enter the last four digits of my social and my address, and now we've established, OK, there is a voter named Bradley Tusk in New York City, but am I Bradley Tusk? So the first thing is multifactor authentication. So that's just like when you forget your Google password, they send you a code, you put it into the app. The second thing is biometric screening, so take a scan of your face. Now we've established I'm really me. The ballot appears on my screen.Whenever I'm done and I'm ready to submit, three things happen. First, my ballot is encrypted. Second, it's anonymized. And third, I get a tracking code, like if it were a FedEx package. It then goes back to the Board of Elections, and they air gap it, which means they just take it offline. And once my ballot is not connected to the internet, then they decrypt it. A paper copy of my ballot gets printed out. That gets mixed in with all the other ballots, and that's what's scanned and tabulated. I can see where my ballot stands because the tracking code will show me that it was received, printed, tabulated and so on, and so you can have confidence in the results.PARKS: I know you all did work with a company, Free & Fair, who's considered a credible election technology vendor. But I did talk this week with Professor Andrew Appel of Princeton University. He's part of this group of computer scientists and experts who I think you're familiar with.TUSK: Sure, of course.PARKS: These are people who have been pretty skeptical of your work for years. And what he told us was that what the project published essentially does not actually prove everything that this thing is ready for prime time any more than any other previous time. Let's just listen to a little bit of this.ANDREW APPEL: The report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (ph) published in 2018 - and I was one of the coauthors of that report - said that as of 2018, internet voting was not securable by any currently known technology. Didn't say it would never, ever be possible. It's still true in 2025 that there's no currently known technology that will do it.PARKS: So he read everything that you all have published. He wrote a blog post laying out a bunch of issues that he saw with it. Have you seen the blog post and do you have any response to that?TUSK: I have, and I just think he got a lot of it wrong. He pointed out three specific areas where he thought the technology fell short. The first was ballot checks, and that is voters going back and looking at a PDF of their ballot to ensure that it's what they intended to do. We've built a system to do that. We give you a code, you put it into a different device, a PDF of your ballot comes up. His second point was the lack of a dispute resolution protocol. And the reason why that's not in the tech that we have built is every jurisdiction has totally different views as to how they want to handle that. So whatever approach, you know, any specific city, county, state wants to use, that could then be built by whatever vendor they're working with into the system. And then his third point was just the risk of malware. And he's right. That is a risk that exists every time that you go on the internet, every time you use your phone, every time you use your iPad, no matter what.Things go wrong at polling places all of the time. The volunteers don't show up. Someone pulls the fire alarm. And then with mail-in ballots, trucks get lost. Ballots get lost. Crates get lost. So, you know, to say that you need this absolute standard of perfection for mobile voting when the real ways that we vote today are far below that doesn't make sense. Let cities opt into it if they want to, so they don't even have to. If they choose to, it would be one of several forms of voting. And it would only apply to the most, you know, local municipal elections and see what works and go from there.To deny ourselves that opportunity and to keep the system the way it is when the technology exists - it's built, I pay for it, it's free, I'm giving it away - just doesn't make any sense. If you don't do something and you just sit here and explain why nothing can ever work and nothing can ever change, you are throwing in the towel on this country completely, and I'm not willing to do that.PARKS: That's Bradley Tusk. He runs the Mobile Voting project. Thank you so much for talking with us today.TUSK: Yeah, thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Clad in an all-black dress jacket and shirt, the immigrant — who was identified only by the number of his case — swears that his last immigration notice was lost in the mail.   The judge tells him to check his mail regularly, ahead of his next appearance in January.   As the room empties out, the judge says out loud that there are a number of no-shows that day. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, attorney in court files motions to remove five people \"in absentia.\" The judge grants it. Those people can now be deported.   \n   A similar scene has played out, and increasingly so, in nearly every immigration court nationwide over the past year, according to immigration attorneys and NPR's early analysis of court data. The results mirror those of Joseph Gunther, an independent researcher, who has also been tracking the data closely. More immigrants are not showing up for their mandatory immigration court hearings, allowing the government to order their immediate deportation.   \"What happened is that the word spread that if you go to court, you could get picked up from ICE,\" said Ruby Powers, an immigration lawyer based in Texas with cases all over the country.   In 2025, ICE turned to arrests directly from federal or immigration courtrooms in order to meet arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.   \"Those instances weren't consistent around the country, but at least the word had spread, the fear had spread. And so individuals were really hesitant to go into court,\" Powers said.   \n   The number of in absentia removals was generally already on an upward trend each year since 2022, said Andrew Arthur, resident law and policy fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit that advocates for lower levels of migration. Still, the number of such removal orders in fiscal year 2025 nearly tripled that of the previous year — topping over 50,000.   NPR calculated just how many people were ordered removed \"in absentia.\"   Each of the top 10 cities with the largest number of completed immigration cases in those courts is on track to end the year with a higher rate of in absentia removals than they started. That is according to data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review — part of the Department of Justice — from January through November.   \n   Each of these courts experienced an uptick in this kind of removal order starting in the summer months. That timeline is consistent with when immigration attorneys say ICE officers began arresting people inside the courts.   Loading...\n   NPR has spoken with the family members of immigrants who came to court in New York, for example, in place of their parents or partners — out of concern their loved ones might be detained. New York's courts have become notorious this year for scenes of violent arrests and confrontations with federal officers.   Powers said that there are other reasons people may fear coming to court, including that they may not win their case or get deported to a third country. There are logistical barriers, too.   \"A lot of times people don't even know that they have a hearing, or hearing dates can change without receiving the notice in the mail,\" Powers said. Sometimes immigrants can move and addresses are not immediately updated with the court, or go to places like apartment buildings that have less consistent mail delivery, she said. Notices can also be sent to completely incorrect addresses, which lawyers said has been an issue in years past.   Immigration attorneys across the country have noticed an uptick in this kind of removal order. Organizations like the Center for Immigration Studies have also spotted it.   Loading...\n   In many cases, the Department of Homeland Security has to receive a removal order issued by an immigration judge before it can physically deport any person from the U.S., Arthur said.   \"The more orders of removal in absentia or at the end of proceedings that are issued, the more people that ICE can then target for removal from the United States,\" he said.   Arthur said that immigrants who fail to appear opt to not take the government up on the offer for due process.   \n   \"The more people who are under final orders for removal … the more people who are going to end up in ICE custody because the law requires that ICE take into custody everybody who's under a final order of removal, notwithstanding the administration's stated focus on the worst,\" Arthur said.    Loading... \n   \"This appears to be well in excess of those historical trends,\" Arthur said.   Immigrants may have the opportunity to reopen their cases. However, most people in immigration court do not have legal representation, which they must pay for themselves.   Nonprofits like the organization Mobile Pathways have tracked a low rate of arrests in courts. But immigrant advocates said that doesn't mean the fear and negative perceptions go away.   \"It probably falls into the narrative that the administration wants to be portrayed, that these individuals are not participating in the process that they're supposed to,\" Powers said, about the rise in no-show removal orders.   \n   Some families she represents have fled violence, are working through trauma, or are navigating language and other barriers in addition to the immigration law system.   \"[They] are just making the best decisions they can with the information they have provided to them,\" Powers said, adding that most immigrants are still showing up for their court appointments. \"It's just because a lot of things are being stacked up against them. And that's why we're seeing these numbers.\"\n",

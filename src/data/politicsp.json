However, as several independent experts interviewed by NPR note, that claim is false.</p>   <p>At the center of the standoff is the Trump administration's Working Families Tax Cut Act, also known as President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" signed into law in July. </p>   <p>Democrats say it amounts to tax breaks for billionaires and pays for them with deep Medicaid cuts. The White House insists the law protects taxpayers by preventing undocumented immigrants from getting government health benefits — but such individuals were already barred from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, exchanges.</p>   \n   <p>\"It's a complete distortion,\" says Leighton Ku, the director of George Washington University's Center for Health Policy Research. It is \"simply wrong in the details,\" he says.</p>   <p>In the weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, when funding for the federal government was due to expire, GOP lawmakers introduced a continuing resolution to extend the funding until Nov. 21. But Democrats demanded that it also include an extension of ACA subsidies — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>set to expire at the end of the year</u></a> — and the reversal of Medicaid cuts.</p>   <p>Republicans <a href=\"https://www.gop.com/press-release/rnc-statement-on-democrats-shutting-down-the-government/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>have accused</u></a> the Democrats of holding the government hostage to a \"far-left wish list,\" including funding the health care of \"illegal aliens.\" The White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WFTCA-Illegal-Immigrant-Healthcare-Memo-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>has said</u></a> the Republicans' legislation ensures \"that taxpayer dollars are focused on American citizens and do not subsidize healthcare for illegal immigrants.\"</p>   <p>Jonathan Gruber, the chairman of the Economics Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the Republican claim is false. People living in the U.S. who are undocumented \"do not qualify for Medicaid. They do not qualify for tax credits on the [ACA health care] exchanges,\" he says.</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/quick-take/rolling-back-the-big-beautiful-bills-health-care-provisions-would-not-provide-health-care-to-undocumented-immigrants/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>KFF</u></a>, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that analyzes national health issues, notes that U.S. health coverage programs for immigrants are generally limited to those lawfully present. Medicaid and CHIP — which provides low-cost coverage to uninsured children and pregnant women — are restricted to immigrants with a \"qualified\" status, such as refugees and asylees, most of whom must wait five years before enrolling.</p>   \n   <p>Subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage is available to these qualified immigrants as well as others, including those with Temporary Protected Status or certain work visas, while Medicaid eligibility is limited to lawfully present immigrants who meet age and work requirements, according to KFF. The Center for Children & Families at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University has also <a href=\"https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/05/21/the-truth-about-medicaid-coverage-for-immigrants-and-the-looming-threats/#:~:text=Undocumented%20immigrants%20are%20not%20eligible,legal%20immigrants%20in%20the%20country.\" target=\"_blank\"><u>fact-checked the claim</u></a> and come to a similar conclusion.</p>   <p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.nilc.org/resources/healthcoveragemaps/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>some states provide fully-state-funded medical care for some undocumented individuals</u></a>, but even those programs are being rolled back. Beginning next year in <a href=\"https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/keep-your-Medi-Cal/Pages/Medi-Cal-Immigrant-Eligibility-FAQs.aspx#:~:text=The%20type%20of%20Medi%2DCal%20coverage%20you%20can,full%20Medi%2DCal%20coverage%2C%20regardless%20of%20immigration%20status.\" target=\"_blank\"><u>California</u></a>, for example, undocumented adults will no longer be able to enroll in that state's Medi-Cal program, although children will still be covered regardless of their immigration status.</p>   \n   <p>Gruber, who has worked on health and health care coverage policy for several decades, says the shutdown \"isn't about undocumented immigrants getting health care. It's about cutting health insurance\" for millions of low-income Americans.</p>   <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/61505-SNAP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Congressional Budget Office</u></a> estimates that the federal spending on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — another priority for Democrats — will be reduced by more than $1 trillion over the next decade as a result of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p>   <p>Ku, of George Washington University, says part of the confusion is over the definition of who is and who isn't undocumented. \"Sometimes when Republicans use the phrase 'illegal immigrant,' they include people who actually have legal status — like asylees, refugees, or those with Temporary Protected Status — just because they don't like them.\"</p>   <p>Although Emergency Medicaid does technically cover undocumented people, it serves mainly as a backstop for hospitals, who are required by law to treat patients turning up in emergency rooms, regardless of their immigration status. \"Medicaid just helps hospitals cover those costs,\" Ku says.</p>   <p>\"Emergency Medicaid is one or two billion dollars out of a trillion-dollar program. It's a tiny fraction,\" he adds. \"This is a tail-wagging-the-dog problem. These issues are a minuscule part of Medicaid and ACA spending, but they're being blown up into something they're not.\"</p>   \n   <p>Gruber says health care is a complicated issue and \"the more complicated the issue, the easier it is to make a misleading claim.\"</p>   <p>An <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5557396/poll-shutdown-congress-trump-approval-rating\" target=\"_blank\"><u>NPR/PBS News/Marist poll</u></a> published earlier this week found that 38% of Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown, 27% blame Democrats, and 31% believe both parties are to blame.</p>   <p>He says that for Republicans, claiming the shutdown is about extending health care to undocumented individuals \"sounds good, it feels good, and it plays into the idea that people who 'don't look like they belong here' are getting benefits. But it's just not true.\"</p>\n</div>",

Raphael Warnock says the federal government shutdown is not about whether Republicans or Democrats \"win or lose.\"</p>   <p>Leaders of both parties remained steadfast in their positions after the shutdown began Wednesday: Democrats want to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that millions rely on and undo health spending cuts from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Republicans say they want to negotiate the subsidies after reaching an agreement to fund the government.</p>   <p>Warnock told <em>Morning Edition </em>that Georgians in rural areas have expressed concerns about losing access to health care. He said a small business owner told him she decided to close her business because paying for health insurance would be too expensive without ACA subsidies.</p>   \n   <p>The senator told NPR's Leila Fadel that the White House should \"stop acting like these are pieces on a chessboard. These are people's lives.\"</p>   <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for the shutdown <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5561131/government-shutdown-white-house-karoline-leavitt\" target=\"_blank\">during an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em></a>, saying they picked a \"partisan fight\" over healthcare spending at the \"ninth hour.\"</p>   \n   <p>Leavitt also defended the Trump administration's plans for permanent layoffs during the shutdown. She said President Trump planned to meet with the Office of Management and Budget to decide what agencies are essential and which ones \"do not align with the administration's 'priorities and values.'\"</p>   <p>The White House singled out Warnock and fellow Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff <a href=\"https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1973790212791865536\" target=\"_blank\">in a post on X</a>, saying their votes in the Senate left military service members without pay at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia and hurt businesses around it. The federal government employs more than 100,000 people in Georgia, <a href=\"https://dol.georgia.gov/press-releases/2025-10-03/georgia-department-labor-mobilizes-resources-support-federal-employees#:~:text=The%20Georgia%20Department%20of%20Labor,the%20ongoing%20federal%20government%20shutdown.\" target=\"_blank\">according to the state's Department of Labor.</a></p>   \n   <p>Warnock defended his recent votes, saying he \"voted to keep the government open a few times this week,\" referring to a Democrat-backed plan that would have funded the government, extended ACA subsidies and repealed cuts to health care programs. \"Why don't they come down to Georgia and look into the faces of the people that I'm seeing?\"</p>   <p>As a pastor, Warnock said he's \"hoping against hope\" that GOP members will come to negotiate and realize that federal cuts to health care spending will hurt their own constituents.</p>   \n   <p>\"They're betting that I care more about these people in Georgia who are losing their jobs and who are struggling with health care than they do. And sadly, that appears to be the case,\" Warnock said. \"I hope they'll center the people and then we have a chance at getting the public policy right.\"</p>   <p><em>Ally Schweitzer edited the digital and radio versions of this story.

But U.S. Park Police hauled it onto a truck and carried it away before sunrise on Sept. 24, less than a full day after it appeared.</p>   <p>A Secret Handshake group member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, told NPR over email at the time that they did not get 24 hours' written notice as required by the permit.</p>   \n   <p>A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior told NPR that the statue was removed \"because it was not compliant with the permit issued,\" though did not specify how. The White House did not respond to NPR's questions about the statue's removal.</p>   <p>The group was later able to recover the statue — with the figures ripped from their pedestals and broken into pieces — and set about trying to re-erect it. One week and one failed attempt later, <em>Why Can't We Be Friends?</em> returned to the Mall on Thursday.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4497x2998+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fca%2F263cda7d4052b78a26cdec7be8b6%2Fgettyimages-2238412204.jpg\" alt=\"Onlookers take pictures of the statue on Thursday, with the Washington Monument visible behind them.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Onlookers take pictures of the statue on Thursday, with the Washington Monument visible behind them.\n                <b>\n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>\"Just like a toppled confederate general forced back onto a public square, the Donald Trump Jeffrey Epstein statue has risen from the rubble to stand gloriously on the National Mall once again,\" The Secret Handshake member wrote in an email to NPR.</p>   \n   <p>The statue is permitted to remain on the Mall through 8 p.m. local time on Oct. 6.</p>   <p>This is actually the third permit the group has received for this statue.

While Republicans control the Senate, they do need some Democratic support to get the 60 votes needed to approve the funding. But Democratic leadership wants any agreement to include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that millions rely on and to undo cuts made to health spending by President Trump's signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Republicans say they want to negotiate the subsidies after reaching an agreement to fund the government.</p>   \n   <p>The White House <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559296/government-shutdown-trump-house\" target=\"_blank\">has proposed layoffs to the federal workforce</a> in response to a prolonged shutdown, which has drawn a lawsuit from various unions representing federal workers. Typically in a temporary funding lapse like this, a broad swath of workers is furloughed, but not permanently fired.</p>   <p>In an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em>, Leavitt said President Trump is meeting with the Office of Management and Budget to look at \"where can we cut back to save money in a responsible way that respects the American taxpayer's money, especially when we are in this financial crunch right now, in the midst of a Democrat shutdown.\"</p>   \n   <p>Speaking to NPR's Steve Inskeep, Leavitt discussed the White House's stance on the shutdown and why the administration believes Democrats are to blame.</p>   <p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>      <h3>Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>Steve Inskeep:</strong> As everybody knows, the president likes to make deals. What's his plan to get out of this?</p>   <p><strong>Karoline Leavitt: </strong>Look, the president does love to make deals. And he offered Democrats on Capitol Hill a very simple deal to pass a clean continuing resolution. That's what the president supported. That's what Republicans introduced. And this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. There were three Senate Democrats who eventually voted for it. But that is not enough. Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open. So unfortunately, we are now in a federal government shutdown, and this is not what President Trump wanted. We're in talks with moderate Democrat senators who know that this is not the right thing to do, who know that they supported this exact same piece of legislation to keep the government open as recently as March. They've supported it 13 times in the past. There is zero reason for them to now be pushing this shutdown in the name of health care. Right now, we need to keep the government open. Discussions about health care can happen after we do that. And the president is continuing to encourage people on Capitol Hill to vote so that it's clean.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>It sounds to me like you're not necessarily going to the Democratic leadership. You're going to see if you can pick off a few more moderate Democrats and get up to 60 votes to get out of this. Is that the idea?</p>   <p><strong>Leavitt: </strong>Well, the president did go to the Democratic leadership. We had Senator Chuck Schumer and the House majority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, at the White House … and the president offered them an opportunity to come to their senses. And unfortunately, they chose a different path. They remained defiant and they picked a partisan fight over health care funding, which, by the way, is a fight and a discussion worth having. But we can't have it at the ninth hour when the federal government is shutting down and now our troops are going without pay. We have federal staff that have been furloughed from their jobs, federal staff that are working without pay. And that's unacceptable and it's deeply unfortunate.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>Now, let's talk about this assertion that is made on the Democratic side. They are wanting to extend tax credits for Obamacare health insurance premiums. There are 24 million Americans, roughly, who use these marketplaces. They benefit from these tax credits. The enrollment is not for next year. The enrollment actually comes in a few weeks, Nov. 1. And those millions of people are citizens and taxpayers who are about to be faced with much higher premiums. Does the president have a plan to address that concern before they start enrolling Nov. 1?</p>   <p><strong>Leavitt: </strong>Look, the president and vice president, the White House has consistently said we are very much going to engage on this issue and have robust discussions about it and figure out what is the best policy for our country moving forward. But right now, we need to reopen the government so those discussions can continue and we can get back to doing the business of the American people.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2F87%2F5053b6e74e1e87caca917e9f40cb%2Fap25275726366295.jpg\" alt=\"People can be seen in the reflection of the Information Center front doors along with a closed sign to the center due to the nationwide government shutdown at Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Thursday, Oct. 2, in Keystone, S.D.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                People can be seen in the reflection of the Information Center front doors along with a closed sign to the center due to the nationwide government shutdown at Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Thursday, Oct. 2, in Keystone, S.D.\n                <b>\n                    Matt Gade/AP\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Matt Gade/AP\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>But the clean resolution would push you back beyond Nov. 1. You wouldn't be able to do it in time.</p>   <p><strong>Leavitt: </strong>Well, the premiums that you're discussing don't expire until the end of the calendar year. And so right now, we need to keep the government open. We want to pass a clean continuing resolution for the next seven weeks, and we'll address the budget fight once again when that seven weeks lapses. But at least in those seven weeks, those discussions on health care and all of the other issues our country is facing can continue. And you've heard the vice president of the United States say numerous times, as soon as we reopen the government, he will go to Capitol Hill right away to discuss this very important topic of health care. But right now, again, the government needs to reopen. We have people who cannot afford critical food assistance. You look at members of our military, air traffic controllers, federal law enforcement officers, all of whom are having to work without pay right now.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>I want to ask about something else here. The administration says it's preparing to fire people. I know there was a meeting about that earlier in the week and the president said before the shutdown \"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them.\" What is the reason to do bad things here and what bad things are planned?</p>   <p><strong>Leavitt: </strong>Well, unfortunately, we have to do things we don't want to do because the government is completely shut down and there's zero money coming into the federal government's coffers.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>I'm trying to figure that out. First, tax money is still coming in. This does seem to be a short-term issue. It's not like the government is about to run out of money. There's an authority not to spend money or not.</p>   <p><strong>Leavitt:</strong> Well, we're $37 trillion in debt.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>The president has talked about shutting down what he calls \"Democrat agencies.\" Which agencies are the \"Democrat agencies\"?</p>   <p><strong>Leavitt: </strong>Well, that's something that the White House is currently discussing. And the president is meeting with the Office of Management and Budget to try to understand what agencies are essential, what agencies do not align with the administration's priorities and values. I think every single one of your listeners would agree the federal government is way too big. And so where can we cut back to save money in a responsible way that respects the American taxpayer's money, especially when we are in this financial crunch right now, in the midst of a Democrat shutdown.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>When the administration cancelled an $18 billion spending on infrastructure projects in New York City, was that a shot at Chuck Schumer of New York and Democrats in general in a blue state?</p>   <p><strong>Leavitt: </strong>Well, look, this is one of the many things we're taking a look at. What are these wasteful projects doing? And by the way, the reason for that is because the Department of Transportation workers who were working and pushing out the funds for that were all furloughed. They can't show up to work right now. So that project is currently temporarily halted because of Chuck Schumer's shutdown. So Chuck Schumer did that to himself. He did that to his constituents in New York. If the government remained open because Chuck Schumer and the Democrats voted for it, that infrastructure project would be ongoing.</p>   \n   <p><em>This digital article was edited by Treye Green.

The anonymous, crowd-sourced app describes itself as \"Waze but for ICE sightings,\" and claims to serve as an early warning system informing people when ICE agents are nearby.</p>   \n   <p>The app was launched in April and garnered hundreds of thousands of downloads, but it was only after Attorney General Pam Bondi put Apple on notice, demanding the app be pulled from the App Store, that the company made it unavailable.</p>   <p>\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so,\" said Bondi <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/apple-takes-down-ice-tracking-app-after-pressure-from-ag-bondi\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement to Fox News</a>.</p>   <p>The Justice Department did not respond to NPR's questions about its request. </p>   <p>Since the app never had an Android version, it was not on Google's Play Store. Still, a company spokesperson told NPR that it, too, \"removed similar apps for violations of our policies,\" falling in line with Apple's actions.</p>   <p>The developer of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, said he made the app in response to the Trump administration's stepped up immigration enforcement. After it was booted from Apple's app store, Aaron blamed political pressure and vowed to fight it.</p>   <p>He argued the app's service was engaged in a type of protected speech not unlike some of Apple's own apps, like the company's mapping app which allows users to crowdsource accidents, hazards and police speed traps along roadways.</p>   <p>\"Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,\" Aaron said in a statement.</p>   \n   <p>Apple's action has reignited the debate about what's known as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5545720/kimmel-abc-carr-fcc-jawboning\" target=\"_blank\">jawboning</a>, when government officials censor speech through intimidation and threats.</p>   \n   <p>Conservatives for years <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/17/nx-s1-5009201/supreme-court-social-media-censorship-election-disinformation\" target=\"_blank\">accused the Biden administration</a> of this tactic over communications it had with tech companies related to accounts that were spreading COVID and election misinformation.</p>   <p>Jimmy Kimmel's brief suspension by ABC following comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5545720/kimmel-abc-carr-fcc-jawboning\" target=\"_blank\">widely regarded</a> by legal experts as illegal jawboning.</p>   \n   <p>Kate Ruane, Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project, said Apple's move should also be viewed as the government's heavy hand muzzling free expression.</p>   <p>\"When companies agree to the administration's demands in order to achieve some other goal, whether it be avoiding tariffs or getting merger approval, they send a message to others that it's ok to do the same,\"Ruane said. \"What's worse, they erode the promise of the First Amendment for all of us at the same time.\"</p>   \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/14/nx-s1-5501591/trump-corporate-america-capitalism\" target=\"_blank\">Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> has made strides to ingratiate himself with Trump, as the administration enacts an aggressive tariff policy that could hurt Apple's bottom line, since much of its production happens in China, India and elsewhere overseas.</p>   <p>Cook in August walked into the White House and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cp8zyyygxv7o\" target=\"_blank\">gave Trump</a> a 24-karat gold plaque, a move that has come to symbolize Silicon Valley's deference to the president.</p>   \n   <p>Trump has given Apple and other tech companies something of a gift, too, by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/12/nx-s1-5363025/apple-iphone-tariff-exemption-china\" target=\"_blank\">exempting</a> smartphones, including Apple's iPhones, from tariffs.</p>   <p>\"I think many large organizations are trying to keep their metaphorical heads down and act cautiously, even when the government is acting improperly or even unconstitutionally,\" said Gautam Hans, a law professor at Cornell University, who believes Apple would have a jawboning case but does not expect the company to pursue it. \"Compliance will only incentivize further government demands.\"</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>As the government shutdown enters its third day, the GOP-led Senate will vote for the fourth time on partisan stopgap bills. Meanwhile, the White House is threatening mass layoffs for federal workers.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p><p> The Trump administration has said it will take the opportunity to increase the pain on their fellow Americans by firing federal workers. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is not warning them off.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JOHN THUNE: Anytime you're in the situation where you have to manage a shutdown, decisions have to be made about what to prioritize, where you're going to spend money. I expect there are going to be some decisions coming out about that. That wouldn't surprise me at all.</p><p>INSKEEP: The Republican-led Senate will vote for the fourth time today on partisan stopgap bills that are expected to fail.</p><p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been reporting on all this and joins us now. Hi, Claudia.</p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.</p><p>FADEL: Good morning. So why go through the motion of voting on these dueling bills when they don't have the votes?</p><p>GRISALES: Right. Leader Thune says this is a tactic to pressure Democrats to fold. Let Republicans overcome a filibuster holding up government funding. They need Democrats to reach this required 60-vote threshold today, but we're not expecting them to help. So far, only three have defected to vote with Republicans. And as we know, the GOP only controls 53 Senate seats, so they need at least seven Democrats. Probably more, as one Republican Kentucky senator, Rand Paul, is expected to vote no. The rest of the Democratic caucus has said they will not help unless Republicans address expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, or ACA program.</p><p>FADEL: And this is also a big issue for Americans. Twenty million people could see their insurance premiums spike, in some cases double. If these expire, are Senate Republicans willing to talk at this point?</p><p>GRISALES: Not really. Not right now. A bipartisan group was in talks this week. I followed up with one member, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota. He said Republicans were simply trying to convince Democrats, first vote on this stopgap, known as a continuing resolution or CR.</p><p>MIKE ROUNDS: If they don't pass a short-term CR, there is no way of getting anything done in time to do the things that they want to with regard to ACA subsidies.</p><p>GRISALES: So he says these subsidies have to go through a separate bill that's stuck behind this showdown. But for Democrats, there's a chance this is a bait and switch, so most are not budging for now.</p><p>FADEL: Now, Vice President Vance was publicly insisting there's no rush to renew the subsidies, since they don't take effect until next year. Is there plenty of time on this?</p><p>GRISALES: Well, Democrats would argue no. These subsidies don't expire until the end of the year, but they say - with open enrollment coming up next month, they say that needs to be handled now. So you could say Democrats are fighting as well for a popular issue. Perhaps there's a political calculation here, too. NPR has reported that 24 million people are enrolled. They include influential voters, active voters like small business owners, farmers and ranchers.</p><p>FADEL: So lawmakers went into this shutdown feeling it was inevitable. At this point, do they show any urgency about ending it?</p><p>GRISALES: Well, we didn't see much this week. We just saw a lot of posturing. For example, President Trump threatened mass layoffs, cutting, quote, Democratic agencies, and met with the head of management and budget, Russell Vought, on the next steps there. But when I ask Republicans about these cuts, like you heard Thune there at the top, they say it's the administration's prerogative. What's partly fueling the stalemate is a lot of government agencies are still running. Federal paychecks haven't been missed yet, so the American public hasn't noticed much. But as this stretches on, the pressure will only build on Congress and the president.</p><p>FADEL: NPR's Claudia Grisales.

With national park visitor centers locked and hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed, Republicans and Democrats say voters should hold the other side responsible for the fallout.</p>   <p>But in Georgia, some are focused less on who's to blame than how long the shutdown will last.</p>   <p>The last shutdown dragged on for 35 days from Dec. 2018 to Jan. 2019. Among the hardest hit were Transportation Security Administration employees at Atlanta's humungous airport who had to keep working without pay.</p>   <p>\"We did mass distributions of food and there were hundreds of cars in line of people who needed help,\" said Atlanta Community Food Bank president Kyle Waide.</p>   \n   <p>He said it is not clear yet if his organization will be seeing a small uptick in need or something more catastrophic if the shutdown continues for weeks.</p>   <p>Waide said the food bank will do what it can to help families. But if funding runs dry for federal food aid programs such as Women Infants and Children, or WIC, the nonprofit cannot meet the full need for some necessities like baby formula.</p>   <p>\"Nonetheless, there will be more demand the food banks will have to respond to on top of that extraordinary level of need that they're already facing,\" he said.</p>   <p>At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which employs thousands of people at its Atlanta campus, the shutdown also comes at an already taxing time.</p>   \n   <p>The Trump Administration has already slashed CDC jobs and programs. This summer, a shooter who law enforcement says harbored conspiracies about vaccines, fired hundreds of  rounds at CDC buildings.</p>   <p>Now thousands more employees are furloughed and President Trump has threatened mass layoffs during the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"It feels like there's malice, versus what it was like back in 2018, 2019,\" said Yolanda Jacobs, president of the union chapter that represents several thousand CDC employees.</p>   <p>\"Now we feel like whatever is happening is meant to intentionally clear out and cull the herd, so to speak.\"</p>   \n   <h3>How shutdown impacts could ripple across one state</h3>   <p>Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on.</p>   <p>\"Very few things in this world have to be done on time,\" said Ben Parker, the national affairs coordinator at the Georgia Farm Bureau. \"Planting and harvesting are two of them.\"</p>   <p>And Parker said the standstill in Congress is also distracting lawmakers from efforts to pass a Farm Bill.</p>   <p>\"At the end of the day, I can only speak for agriculture,\" Parker said. \"It's better for us if we can move past a shutdown because shutdowns don't help farmers.\"</p>   <p>At the 7,000-acre Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, Brittany Jones, who directs the nonprofit Chattahoochee National Park Conservancy, is also worried about potential lasting consequences of a lengthy shutdown.</p>   <p>\"I had C-SPAN on and it was a long sleepless night,\" Jones said on the morning after the funding lapsed. She was waiting to see if she would need to cancel several fourth grade field trips to the park scheduled for this week.</p>   <p>\"We're gonna have to unfortunately disappoint all those kids that were excited to come to their national park,\" Jones said. \"That was a hard one this morning.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2420x1816+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fa6%2F16333e454f01b6ea783150b363be%2Fprocessed-a949ba25-29d6-4899-bfb2-129638990b2f.jpeg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

Jones said she's proud the conservancy can step up during a moment of need.</p>   <p>\"But we also don't want to set a precedent for stepping in too deep,\" she said. \"And when the government comes back online, then there's an assumption that we can take on more roles, when the reality is that our mission is to enhance the park, not run the park.\"</p>   <p>Jones is worried that shutdown could permanently reshape that relationship.</p>   <h3>Who is responsible for the government shutdown?</h3>   <p>Eighty three year-old Mary Keesee comes to this park often.</p>   \n   <p>\"On a warm day, you'll see the cormorants in the trees with their wings out, and I think that will be so great to see,\" she said. \"That's on my bucket list for the fall.\"</p>   <p>Keesee said she is not sure who is responsible for the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"I just heard something from one of the walkers that the Democrats want to give free health insurance, but I wasn't sure to who,\" she said.</p>   <p>Keesee is referring to false claims Republicans have made about Democrats wanting to provide subsidies to undocumented immigrants.</p>   \n   <p>Democrats are holding out for a deal to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>extend subsidies</u></a> for health insurance plans offered under the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire soon. Without the subsidies, many policyholders could see their premiums increase significantly – and some may no longer be able to afford the coverage.</p>   <p>Republicans also argue the subsidies, which were created during the pandemic, are too expensive. A few want to work with Democrats to preserve them.</p>   <p>Lauren Colbert, executive director of the advocacy group Georgians for a Healthy Future, said enrollment on the insurance policy marketplace created through the ACA has tripled in Georgia since the subsidies were passed in 2020.</p>   <p>At a trailhead, Stephen and Amantha Moore were unloading a picnic cooler from their rental car. They had just arrived in Georgia from Massachusetts.</p>   <p>\"My retirement goal is to visit every park managed by the Park Service, so this is day two of a trip that appears like it's not going to go as planned,\" Moore said.</p>   <p>As they unfurled a big road map and flipped through a detailed itinerary honed over months, they explained how they thought about the shutdown.</p>   \n   <p>\"I respect the Democrats for taking a stand, finally,\" Amantha Moore said.</p>   <p>Stephen Moore said Democrats should hold the line, but for how long – he is not sure.</p>   <p>\"One of our sons worked for the National Park Service during that long period when the government shut down and there were people in dire straits,\" Amantha Moore said.</p>   <p>But she said she struggles to square the tradeoff between fighting for the health subsidies and a shutdown that is forcing many federal workers to go without pay.</p>   \n   <h3>How the shutdown could shape the midterms</h3>   <p>This purple stretch of Atlanta suburbs will be a key battleground in next year's midterms, when Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is up for reelection. He voted against the Republican stop-gap bill.</p>   <p>J.D. Rhine has supported candidates from both parties but is not able to point a finger for the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"I try to listen to media that represents the Republicans and Democrats and weigh what I hear from both of those, and I can't come to any conclusion,\" Rhine said.</p>   <p>But finishing lunch on the main street in nearby Roswell, Reg Hunter does not hesitate to blame Democrats for the shutdown.</p>   <p>\"Now Ossoff himself, I've heard him talk and he seems like a fairly reasonable guy,\" he said.</p>   <p>Hunter's lunch companion, Thomas Nelson, said he's not sure if the shutdown will affect his vote.</p>   <p>\"Maybe depending on how people act, and how it gets resolved, how long it lasts,\" Nelson said. \"I don't spend a lot of time worrying about it. I think more about my kids and grandkids.\"</p>   <p>Though for many people that could change the longer the shut down wears on.<br /></p>\n</div>",

Subsidies don't expire until the end of the year, but open enrollment is next month, which is the <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5561591:x\" target=\"_blank\">driving force behind Democrats' argument</a> that it needs to be handled now. The GOP insists that they should pass a short-term continuing resolution and subsidies will go into a separate bill. Democrats worry there's a chance this option is a bait and switch, Grisales says.</li></ul>   \n   <p><strong>The Labor Department's monthly report on jobs and unemployment has been postponed</strong> by the government shutdown. Typically, the report is released on the first Friday of the month and includes information about how many jobs were added or subtracted from each industry. <br /></p>   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>Job growth has slowed down in recent months</strong>, and forecasters had expected today's report to indicate that employers added around 50,000 last month, says NPR's Scott Horsley. That would be more jobs than August's numbers, but a <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5561591:x\" target=\"_blank\">slowdown compared to this time last year</a>. A key question for policymakers is whether the U.S. is adding enough jobs to keep pace with the labor force and prevent the unemployment rate from rising. It is difficult to know the answer without solid data from the government.</li></ul>   <p><strong>The White House sent a letter to several universities this week, pressuring them to sign a formal agreement</strong> pledging to support many of President Trump's policy priorities. This comes after earlier attempts to force changes at top universities by cancelling billions of dollars in research grants. Some of the demands include keeping tuition flat for five years and providing the government with data on international students. In return, schools would get priority access to federal grants. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>The nine colleges that received letters include Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Texas</strong>, according to NPR's Elissa Nadworny. The chairman of the UT System Board of Regents said that the system was honored and welcomes the new opportunity. Other schools have stated they are still reviewing the information. Critics say this is a <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5561591:x\" target=\"_blank\">threat to free speech</a> and to academic independence. The American Association of University Professors is urging colleges not to sign the agreement.</li></ul>   <h3>Picture show</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2160x1215+0+113/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2Fca%2Feac57c6847c89fbff0e279b4abcf%2Fcolombia-15.JPG\" alt=\"Grupos gaiteros, bailarines y público en general, desfilan hacia el cementerio de San Jacinto, Colombia, el 14 de agosto de 2022.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Grupos gaiteros, bailarines y público en general, desfilan hacia el cementerio de San Jacinto, Colombia, el 14 de agosto de 2022.\n                <b>\n                    Karla Gachet\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Karla Gachet\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p><em>This is part of a special series, </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-89583/cumbia-across-latin-america\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cumbia Across Latin America</em></a><em>, a visual report covering the people, places and cultures that keep this music genre alive in six countries.</em></p>   <p>Cumbia, one of the most listened to genres in the Americas, originated in the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The genre emerged in the river system of the Mompos Depression, a vast wetland and in a small mountain range known as Montes de María. During the colonization of America in the 16th century, thousands of enslaved people arrived from Africa at the port of Cartagena.

But $2.3 million, there is no way to trim around that.\"</p>   \n   <h3>A disaster averted, then a blow from Washington</h3>   <p>South Dakota Public Broadcasting had already sidestepped one financial catastrophe. In December, Kristi Noem — then the state's Republican governor — proposed cutting most of the state funds that the network receives, shortly before she left to become Trump's secretary of homeland security. The Republican-dominated state legislature in Pierre knocked that down.</p>   <p>In July came the thunderbolt from Washington. It took out nearly a quarter of South Dakota Public Broadcasting's budget.</p>   <p>\"A lot of people really consider SDPB to kind of be the rock and [to] do the work — the important work — of making sure that all of our news in South Dakota doesn't eventually get piped in from someplace else,\" Overgaard says.</p>   <p>South Dakota Public Broadcasting officials had hoped they could appeal to the state's U.S. senators, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Mike Rounds, both Republicans who have appeared regularly on their shows.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F8b%2F7f0e9c99440bb0d43a7b7bd490c2%2Fnpr-sd-45-edit.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Overgaard has been the executive director of South Dakota Public Broadcasting since 1997.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Julie Overgaard has been the executive director of South Dakota Public Broadcasting since 1997.\n                <b>\n                    Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>Thune nonetheless moved Trump's rescission plan, which also included billions of dollars cut from foreign aid. Rounds says he has arranged for a $9 million federal <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5469904/npr-pbs-cuts-rescission-senate-vote\" target=\"_blank\">grant for imperiled stations serving tribal populations</a>. His office says it's coming from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Details are scant: It's unclear when or how that money will be distributed.</p>   <p>South Dakota Public Broadcasting also highlights Native American issues, but executives say it doesn't qualify for that grant.</p>   <p>To make ends meet, it has slashed its newsroom to just four journalists from 11. It has dropped television news shows, educational initiatives and a daily, hourlong public affairs radio show called <em>In the Moment</em>.</p>   <p>\"This is our signature show, and it's crushing to not have it,\" says Cara Hetland, the director of radio and journalism content.</p>   <p>Much of the wrath from Trump and the Republican Party was directed at PBS and NPR, not local stations, for what conservatives contend is liberal bias — a charge the networks reject. Some Republican lawmakers even took pains to praise offerings from their local stations.</p>   \n   <p>In an irony she has not overlooked, Overgaard says she's more likely now to take shows from NPR and other outside producers to fill the holes.</p>   <p>\"It costs more money to create local programming than it does to purchase national programming,\" Overgaard says. \"That's just a fact of life.\"</p>   <h3>Pain from federal cuts ripple throughout the U.S.</h3>   <p>This week marks the start of a new era for public media: Without federal subsidies, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit that has funneled those dollars to public media outlets for nearly 60 years, has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5489808/cpb-shut-down-public-broadcasting-trump\" target=\"_blank\">laid off nearly all its staff</a> and is winding down operations. Repercussions have been equally stark around the country, though they have taken different forms.</p>   <p>There have been layoffs at public television and radio stations large and small, in markets including Melbourne, Fla., South Bend, Ind., Charlotte, N.C., Houston, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. In all, stations have laid off more than 400 employees, according to former NPR employee Alex Curley, who is tracking job cuts online. Classical music stations have been affected.

Officials say they will continue to produce local content, including a gardening radio show and a TV show about the state's attractions and culture.</p>   <p>The united front that the national public media giants have maintained for so long is also among the casualties. In a hearing at a federal court in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, lawyers for NPR argued that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) had unlawfully <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/27/nx-s1-5554882/npr-federal-funds-decline-clashes-cpb\" target=\"_blank\">awarded a $57.9 million grant</a> to a consortium of other public media institutions to operate a satellite that helps power the public radio system.</p>   \n   <p>NPR has run the satellite for more than four decades; its executives say a top CPB executive told them in April that they would be given a three-year renewal, only to have that reversed days later after Trump publicly accused NPR and PBS of bias and called for all federal funding for them to cease.</p>   <p>NPR's lawyers are arguing on First Amendment grounds that CPB is wrongly yielding to Trump's order that the network receive no federal funds. CPB denies this.</p>   <h3>Trump supporters see benefits in local public media</h3>   <p>Public media executives said from the outset that if Congress killed subsidies, those stations that serve rural and tribal audiences would be hit the hardest — stations like South Dakota Public Broadcasting.</p>   <p>South Dakota is Trump country. And yet, like in many other rural regions, people here find that public media serves a need as other local news outlets are increasingly hard to come by.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/300/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 300w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 298px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(((100vw - 365px)/3) - 30px), (min-width: 768px) calc(((100vw - 30px)/3) - 30px), calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/300/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 300w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 298px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(((100vw - 365px)/3) - 30px), (min-width: 768px) calc(((100vw - 30px)/3) - 30px), calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2666x4000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F65%2Fef36c60342c18fdd3518621eb2d8%2Fnpr-sd-142-edit.jpg\" alt=\"Nat Van Gorkum, manager of a plumbing-supplies warehouse, says he opposes cutting money for public broadcasting and supports President Trump.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Nat Van Gorkum, manager of a plumbing-supplies warehouse, says he opposes cutting money for public broadcasting and supports President Trump.\n                <b>\n                    Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Kelcey Schroder for NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>\"Trump is vindictive, as we all know.

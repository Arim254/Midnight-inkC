The announcement was made a day after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the president's sweeping use of emergency powers to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The 6-3 ruling is a major blow to Trump's economic policy agenda.   \n   Trump said his decision to raise taxes on imports to 15% is based on \"a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.\"   Many countries were still reeling from Trump's announcement of new tariffs Friday night when he signed a proclamation to impose a temporary 10% hike on imports of goods from around the world. The tariffs would be limited to 150 days.   In the proclamation, Trump cites the Trade Act of 1974 as authorizing the tariffs. Trump made clear on Saturday he plans to continue centering tariffs in his economic policy, despite legal setbacks.   \"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,\" he said in the social media post.   The president's proclamation issued Friday said that certain goods from Canada and Mexico covered under a separate agreement with the U.S. would be exempt from the new tariffs. It also said the levies would not apply to certain agricultural products, including beef, tomatoes, and oranges.\n",

The programs are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines. Suspending them could cause headaches for fliers.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that \"shutdowns have serious real world consequences.\" She also said that \"TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts.\"   The partial government shutdown began Feb. 14 after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump's deportation campaign.   \n   Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized the decision about airport security.   They said on social media that the administration was \"kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure\" and accused them of \"ruining your travel on purpose.\"\n",

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 12-6 to lift a block that a lower court first placed on the law in 2024. In the opinion released Friday, the court said it was too early to make a judgment call on the constitutionality of the law.   That's partly because it's not yet clear how prominently schools may display the religious text, if teachers will refer to the Ten Commandments during classes or if other texts like the Mayflower Compact or the Declaration of Independence will also be displayed, the majority opinion said.   \n   Without those sorts of details, the panel decided it did not have enough information to weigh any First Amendment issues that might arise from the law. In other words, there aren't enough facts available to \"permit judicial judgment rather than speculation,\" the majority wrote in the opinion.   In a concurring opinion, Circuit Judge James Ho, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, wrote that the law \"is not just constitutional — it affirms our nation's highest and most noble traditions.\"   The six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, with some arguing that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.   Circuit Judge James L. Dennis, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, wrote that the law \"is precisely the kind of establishment the Framers anticipated and sought to prevent.\"   The ruling is the result of the court's choice to rehear the case with all judges present after three of them ruled in June that the Louisiana law was unconstitutional. The reversal comes from one of the nation's most conservative appeals courts, and one that's known for propelling Republican policies to a similarly conservative U.S. Supreme Court.   \n   Republican Gov. Jeff Landry celebrated the ruling Friday, declaring, \"Common sense is making a comeback!\"   The ACLU of Louisiana, one of several groups representing plaintiffs, pledged to explore all legal pathways to continue fighting the law.   Arkansas has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court. And a Texas law took effect on Sept. 1, marking the widest reaching attempt in the nation to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools.   \n   Some Texas school districts were barred from posting them after federal judges issued injunctions in two cases challenging the law, but they have already gone up in many classrooms across the state as districts paid to have the posters printed themselves or accepted donations.   The laws are among pushes by Republicans, including Trump, to incorporate religion into public school classrooms. Critics say it violates the separation of church and state, while backers say the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.   Joseph Davis, an attorney representing Louisiana in the case, applauded the court for upholding America's \"time-honored tradition of recognizing faith in the public square.\"   Families from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, have challenged the laws, as have clergy members and nonreligious families.   The Freedom From Religion Foundation, another group involved in the challenge, called the ruling \"extremely disappointing\" and said the law will force families \"into a game of constitutional whack-a-mole\" where they will have to separately challenge each school district's displays.   Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after the ruling that she had sent schools several correct examples of the required poster.   In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.   \n   And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.\n",

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenges President Trump's plans for \"Independence Arch,\" a 250-foot structure proposed for Memorial Circle.   The plaintiffs, represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group, call the proposed plan a \"vanity project\" that would disrupt one of Washington's most symbolically charged sightlines between the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington House, a view designed to evoke national unity after the Civil War.   \n   Vietnam veterans Michael Lemmon, Shaun Byrnes and Jon Gundersen believe the structure would \"dishonor their military and foreign service\" by intruding on a solemn view they visit regularly, according to the complaint.   The arch could also \"pose a hazard to air travel at nearby Reagan National Airport,\" the plaintiffs argue. At 250 feet, the proposed arch would stand more than twice the height of the Lincoln Memorial and sit directly on the ceremonial axis that anchors the capital's monumental core.   The lawsuit names Trump, senior White House officials and the National Park Service (NPS) as defendants. It alleges the plan violates multiple federal laws, including the Commemorative Works Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.   NPR reached out to the White House and NPS for comment about the lawsuit but have not received a response.   \n   Administration officials have framed the proposal as part of a broader effort to commemorate the country's 250th anniversary with new monuments and public works projects highlighting American history and military service.   White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement to The Washington Post the arch \"will enhance the visitor experience at Arlington National Cemetery for veterans, the families of the fallen, and all Americans alike, serving as a visual reminder of the noble sacrifices borne by so many American heroes throughout our 250-year history.\"   \n   Ingle also said Trump \"will continue to honor our veterans and give the greatest Nation on earth America the glory it deserves.\"   The plaintiffs also argue that approval has not been granted and that required environmental and historic preservation reviews have not been completed. Under the Commemorative Works Act, memorials built on federal land in Washington generally require authorization from Congress.   Legal opposition to the project follows a separate lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation over plans for a privately funded ballroom in place of the White House East Wing.\n",

Trump called the justices who opposed his tariffs \"fools\" and \"lapdogs,\" charging that they were acting because of liberal partisanship, though three of those ruling against him were appointed by Republican presidents and two were Trump appointees.   \"I think it is deeply disappointing, and I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,\" he said.   The court, in a 6-to-3 decision, found that a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.   \n   The ruling was the president's most significant defeat at the Supreme Court since he returned to office, and it threatens to upend one of Trump's favorite and most powerful tools of his economic and foreign policy agenda.   The decision injects even more uncertainty into the future of tariffs, but Trump made clear that he has no plans on giving up on his agenda.   Calling it his \"favorite word in the dictionary,\" Trump has repeatedly credited his use of tariffs with helping him stop wars and pressure world leaders to bend to U.S. interests.   He boasted about the economic benefits. A recent Congressional Budget Office report found that tariffs were expected to help reduce the deficit by about $3 trillion over a decade. But that same report found that U.S. consumers — not foreign companies — were paying the vast majority of that money.   But while talking with reporters Friday, Trump sought to put a positive spin on the court decision. He said that it would provide certainty for the U.S. economy and that he plans to seek alternatives, which he laid out specifically.   \"Their decision's incorrect. But it doesn't matter, because we have very powerful alternatives that have been approved by this decision,\" he said.   \n   Trump cited a dissent written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who listed laws that the administration could pursue, including \"the Trade Act of 1974, sections 122, 201, 301, and the Tariff Act of 1930, section 338.\"   He acknowledged that those processes may be more cumbersome, but had stronger legal standing. He also cited Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to impose tariffs to address trade deficits. But those tariffs are limited to 15% and for only 150 days, after which Congress would have to approve them.   \"While I am sure that they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court's decision today made the president's ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less. I don't think they meant that. I'm sure they didn't,\" Trump said.   And he said he would sign an executive order later Friday to continue certain tariffs under alternative authorities, including adding a \"10% global tariff.\"   That order would also eventually need approval from Congress, after 150 days, which could be difficult with an election approaching.   Republicans are facing pressure from constituents about high costs and a business community that is afraid to invest with all the economic uncertainty.   A recent NPR/Marist poll finds that a majority of Americans — 56% — feel tariffs or fees on imported products from other countries hurts the U.S. economy.   The former Senate majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, praised the Supreme Court's decision.   \"Congress' role in trade policy, as I have warned repeatedly, is not an inconvenience to avoid,\" the Kentucky Republican said. \"If the executive would like to enact trade policies that impact American producers and consumers, its path forward is crystal clear: Convince their representatives under Article I\" of the Constitution.   But Trump, who has expressed frustration with gridlock in Congress, expressed confidence that he would continue to be able to employ tariffs unilaterally.   \n   \"Foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years are ecstatic,\" Trump said. \"They are so happy and they're dancing in the streets. But they won't be dancing for long. That I can assure you.\"\n",

But the justices left a $133 billion question unanswered: What's going to happen to the money the government has already collected in import taxes now declared unlawful?   \n   Companies have been lining up for refunds. But the way forward could prove chaotic.   When the smoke clears, trade lawyers say, importers are likely to get money back — eventually. \"It's going to be a bumpy ride for awhile,\" said trade lawyer Joyce Adetutu, a partner at the Vinson & Elkins law firm.   The refund process is likely to be hashed out by a mix of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, the specialized Court of International Trade in New York and other lower courts, according to a note to clients by lawyers at the legal firm Clark Hill.   \n   \"The amount of money is substantial,\" Adetutu said. \"The courts are going to have a hard time. Importers are going to have a hard time.''   Still, she added, \"it's going to be really difficult not to have some sort of refund option'' given how decisively the Supreme Court repudiated Trump's tariffs.   In its 6-3 opinion on Friday, the court ruled Trump's attempt to use an emergency powers law to enact the levies was not valid. Two of the three justices appointed by Trump joined the majority in striking down the first major piece of his second-term agenda to come before them.   \n   At issue are double-digit tariffs Trump imposed on almost every country in the world last year by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Supreme Court ruled that the law did not give the president authority to tax imports, a power that belongs to Congress.   The U.S. customs agency has already collected $133 billion in IEEPA tariffs as of mid-December. But consumers hoping for a refund are unlikely to be compensated for the higher prices they paid when companies passed along the cost of the tariffs; that's more likely to go to the companies themselves.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh dinged his colleagues for dodging the refund issue: \"The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers.''   \n   Borrowing a word that Justice Amy Coney Barrett — who sided with the majority — used during the court's November hearing on the case, Kavanaugh warned that \"the refund process is likely to be a 'mess.'\"   \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" Trump told reporters at a press conference Friday, in which he decried the court's decision and said he was \"absolutely ashamed\" of some justices who ruled against his tariffs. \"We'll end up being in court for the next five years.''   The end of the IEEPA tariffs could help the economy by easing inflationary pressures. The tariff refunds — like other tax refunds — could stimulate spending and growth. But the impacts are likely to be modest.   Most countries still face steep tariffs from the U.S. on specific sectors, and Trump intends to replace the IEEPA levies using other options. The refunds that do get issued will take time to roll out — 12 to 18 months, estimates TD Securities.   The U.S. customs agency does have a process for refunding duties when importers can show there's been some kind of error. The agency might try to build on the existing system to refund Trump's IEEPA tariffs, said trade lawyer Dave Townsend, a partner with the law firm Dorsey & Whitney.   And there has been a precedent for courts making arrangements to give companies their money back in trade cases. In the 1990s, the courts struck down as unconstitutional a harbor maintenance fee on exports and set up a system for exporters to apply for refunds.   But the courts and U.S. customs have never had to deal with anything like this — thousands of importers and tens of billions of dollars at once.   \"Just because the process is difficult to administer doesn't mean the government has the right to hold on to fees that were collected unlawfully,\" said trade lawyer Alexis Early, partner at the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.   \n   Ryan Majerus, a partner at King & Spalding and a former U.S. trade official, said it's hard to know how the government will deal with the massive demand for refunds. It might try to streamline the process, perhaps setting up a special website where importers can claim their refunds.   But Adetutu warns that \"the government is well-positioned to make this as difficult as possible for importers. I can see a world where they push as much responsibility as possible onto the importer'' — maybe forcing them to go to court to seek the refunds.   Many companies, including Costco, Revlon and canned seafood and chicken producer Bumble Bee Foods, filed lawsuits claiming refunds even before the Supreme Court ruled, essentially seeking to be at the head of line if the tariffs were struck down.   There are likely to be more legal battles ahead. Manufacturers might, for example, sue for a share of any refunds given to suppliers that jacked up the price of raw materials to cover the tariffs.   \"We may see years of ongoing litigation in multiple jurisdictions,'' Early said.   Consumers, though, are unlikely to enjoy a refund windfall. The higher prices they've had to pay would likely be hard to attribute to a specific tariff. Should they pursue refunds anyway? Early wouldn't advise wasting money on legal fees, but said: \"In America, we have the ability to file a lawsuit for anything we want.''   \n   Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat and Trump antagonist, is demanding a refund on behalf of his state's 5.11 million households. In a letter addressed to Trump and released by Pritzker's gubernatorial campaign, the governor said the tariffs had cost each Illinois household $1,700 — or $8.7 billion. Pritzker said failure to pay will elicit \"further action.''   Nevada Treasurer Zach Conine submitted a payment request to the federal government for $2.1 billion to recoup the costs of the tariffs, his office announced Friday.   \"As Nevada's chief investment officer, I have a responsibility to try to recoup every single dollar that the Trump Administration takes from Nevada families,\" Conine said in a statement.\n",

The nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration's drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well for use by the military.   \n   Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.   A new emphasis on nuclear energy   President Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.   Skeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Energy Secretary Chris Wright speaks at a news conference at March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Sunday Feb. 15, 2026.\n                \n                    Matthew Daly/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matthew Daly/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Wright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump's push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.   \"Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,\" Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force base in Utah.   \n   The minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach \"criticality\" — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.   \"That's speed, that's innovation, that's the start of a nuclear renaissance,\" he said.   Microreactors would be for civilian and military use   Currently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country's electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.   \n   Recognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation's largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.   Microreactors, designed to be portable, can take that a step further and \"accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it's needed,\" Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.   The demonstration flight \"gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation's warfighters the tools to win in battle,\" Duffey said.   The reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.   Some safety concerns haven't been addressed, experts say   Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than \"a dog-and-pony show\" that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.   \n   The flight \"doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,\" Lyman said in an interview.   \n   The Trump administration \"hasn't made the safety case\" for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.   Officials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.   The microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.   \"The answer to energy is always more,\" Wright said. After four years of restrictions on more polluting forms of energy under the Biden administration, he said, \"now we're trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      We look at what yesterday's Supreme Court decision on President Trump's tariffs means for his economic policies and campaign promises.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  President Trump is declaring even higher tariffs today after many he'd ordered were ruled unconstitutional yesterday by the U.S. Supreme Court. This morning, the president said he's raising his new global 10% tariff announced yesterday to 15%, the maximum allowed by law. NPR's White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben joins us. Danielle, thanks so much for being with us.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Absolutely.SIMON: President Trump posted on social media about the tariff increase. What did he say?KURTZLEBEN: Well, like you said, after the ruling yesterday, he signed an executive order imposing 10% tariffs on the entire world. Well, today in a social media post, he said he's upping that to 15% after, quote, \"a thorough, detailed and complete review,\" unquote, of the court's decision. Now, the Supreme Court had invalidated tariffs that he justified using a law called IEEPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. For this new tariff he's announcing, it's a different law. So the unpredictability continues.SIMON: You were at the president's press briefing yesterday, after - shortly after the ruling. Safe to say he wasn't happy, was he?KURTZLEBEN: No, he was furious. And what he said was - I mean, after thanking and congratulating the justices who did side with him, the other justices, he just laid into them, accusing them of being disloyal to the Constitution.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests on a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think. It's a small movement. I won by millions of votes. We won in a landslide.KURTZLEBEN: So the president is accusing Supreme Court justices of being under the sway of foreign influences. Now, that's first of all, wild. And furthermore, when a reporter asked if he had evidence, the president said, you're going to find out. So he didn't even say what he meant. So, yeah, all in all, he was furious because, look, tariffs have been at the center of his economic policy and also just the center of his second term. And this is a blow to that.SIMON: And how big a setback? Because tariffs are about more than just economics for the president in a way, aren't they?KURTZLEBEN: Right, yeah. It's a both/and thing. They're about economics, but they're also about a whole bunch of other things. I mean, Trump constantly talks about tariffs as a fix for all sorts of economic problems, like bringing in revenue, foreign investment. Now, his promises haven't all borne out, mind you. I mean, Trump has said that tariffs would shrink the trade deficit. The latest data shows that hasn't really happened. But he also seems to like them for bigger reasons because tariffs have given him so much power. Trump had claimed he had the ability to impose tariffs when he wanted at the levels he wanted. And as the head of an economic superpower, that gave him so much leverage over other countries. And he used that with trade deals, with pharmaceutical pricing, even with diplomacy. And now he doesn't necessarily have that power anymore.SIMON: He does have some tariff power - those 15% tariffs we mentioned. And he's hinted at more. What will he be able to do?KURTZLEBEN: Well, he'll be able to use other laws, or at least he'll try to. He's imposing these new tariffs under a law known as Section 122, which allows a president to impose tariffs for up to a hundred fifty days. After that, Congress has to vote on it. In addition, some of the tariffs he's already imposed will stick around. They're - these are called Section 232 tariffs. They're the tariffs on things like steel and aluminum and cars. But then he also has cited a few other laws he says he can use to impose tariffs. These are all known by these three-digit numbers - 201, 301, 338. But the upshot is they all give the president some tariffing power. But the difference between those laws and the IEEPA tariffs that the court ruled illegal is that these other laws have restrictions. Some of them require investigations first, which can take weeks or months, or they have time limitations or just limits on the size of the tariff. So yes, he has options, but those options could also be limited in several ways.SIMON: And, of course, polls tells us Americans are pretty pessimistic about the economy right now - concerned about the cost of living. How does that measure up with the president leaning so hard into using tariffs, which, after all, are a form of a tax?KURTZLEBEN: That's right, and that's the big conflict Trump has made for himself here. He's been promoting these tariffs, which, like you said, they're a tax - they raise prices for everybody. At the same time that he's been trying to make the case that he cares about the cost of living, and most voters just don't think the tariffs have helped. Many say the opposite. So if he continues to lean hard into tariffs, that will really affect what political appetite the country has for Republicans in the midterms. And some congressional Republicans, after all, have come out against Trump's tariffs. So that conflict could intensify. So this just makes it remarkable that he's sticking to this policy. He could have used this ruling as an exit ramp, but he hasn't.SIMON: Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks so much.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The president has responded by declaring a new tariff, which he said today he would increase. We're joined now by NPR's Ron Elving. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: It's good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: The Supreme Court's decision was 6 to 3. Three conservative justices joined court liberals. The president called the decision a disgrace to the nation. What's at the heart of their decision?ELVING: It's the Constitution which gives the power to tax to the Congress, and tariffs are a form of tax. Chief Justice John Roberts read his own decision aloud in the courtroom yesterday, and the first 10 minutes were all about this issue. The president's use of tariffs was decidedly outside the president's proper authority, the court ruled, even under the emergency legislation you mentioned. Trump responded by going off on the six Supreme Court justices who decided the case - three appointed by Democrats, three by Republican, including two Trump appointed himself - saying they had brought shame on the nation and were an embarrassment to their families - their families.Asked if these justices would still be welcome at the State of the Union speech at the Capitol this week, Trump said they were barely invite and he didn't care if they came or not. And just for the record, the State of the Union is not a presidential invitation event. He is, in fact, an invited guest of Congress.SIMON: Ron, how is the president using the court decision to announce a new 10% global tariff, which he just said this morning he would increase to 15%?ELVING: Well, while we have everyone's attention, using a different statute with a time limit, he's going to go from 10, which he announced yesterday to 15, which he announced this morning with a line in a post truth social. Now, that post has to be read several times to believe he wrote it. It sounds like a Saturday night parody of Trump. He calls the decision ridiculous, poorly written and extraordinarily anti-American. But it has long been a feature of the Trump style that when he suffers a setback, he spins it around and calls it a win, as he did live for the cameras yesterday. Here he is.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: While I am sure that they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court's decision today made a president's ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less.ELVING: Trump routinely says this kind of thing, knowing it will resonate within a certain media sphere and among a certain kind of followers. But if the court had given him a kind of boost like he just described, would he have called them a national disgrace and an embarrassment to their families?SIMON: Ron, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrested this week, under investigation for sharing confidential government documents with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It's irresistible to note we haven't seen that kind of consequence for any of the officials or former officials involved with Epstein in the U.S.ELVING: No. But first, you just have to say, if you're looking for a case of someone who is a national disgrace and an embarrassment to his family, the former Prince Andrew fills the bill, although some people with far less involvement with Epstein have seen fit to resign their jobs outside the government or have apologized. One administration official with Epstein ties, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik, was there yesterday at Trump's side at that news conference looking very secure. But consider how hard it would be for Trump to start holding his people responsible on Epstein ties after all these months of saying that the whole Epstein saga was nothing but a hoax.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much for being with us. Look forward to speaking with you next week.ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Me, too.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Stanley McChrystal approaches the podium, the room applauds.   \"I can't believe he's here,\" someone whispers.   Almost as if he heard them, McChrystal says this into the microphone.   \"First off, we shouldn't be here.\"   \"Here\" is a retirement ceremony for five transgender service members who have been forcibly separated from the military under the Trump administration's second ban. The ceremony, which normally would be given by the Pentagon, has been hosted by the Human Rights Campaign in Washington, D.C.   To the left of the stage is a table of mannequins dressed in the retirees' uniforms. The service members are prohibited from wearing them for the ceremony.   \n   \"When these professionals finally decide to retire,\" says McChrystal. \"It should happen on parade fields, in offices, on the deck of ships … wherever the Space Force goes, I don't know.\"   The audience laughs, grateful for the playful jab on an otherwise somber day.   McChrystal became a household name in the early-to-mid-2000s during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — as commander of Joint Special Operations from 2003 to 2008, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and all U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010.   McChrystal was known as \"the soldier monk\" for his austere, ascetic lifestyle. He oversaw the special operations that led to the capture of Saddam Hussein and the airstrike that killed Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the al-Qaida leader in Iraq.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Retired four-star Gen. Stanley McChrystal speaks during a retirement ceremony in January hosted by the Human Rights Campaign for five transgender service members forced to retire from the military in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Laura Hatcher/Human Rights Campaign\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Laura Hatcher/Human Rights Campaign\n    \n\n   \n   But today, no longer in uniform, he appears in a suit and tie to preside over the ceremony.   In a sit-down with NPR before the event, McChrystal said that he's served with transgender service members and that he's here today because it's the right thing to do.   \"I think it's unfortunate and I think it's unfair,\" he said. \"But I think it's heartening that a number of people would come together to recognize this publicly.\"   During the ceremony, the emcee reads out the names and titles of those being honored.   \n   \"We gather today to recognize Col. Bree Fram, United States Air Force; Cmdr. Blake Dremann, United States Navy; Lt. Col. Erin Krizek, United States Air Force; Chief Petty Officer Jaida McGuire, United States Coast Guard; and Sgt. 1st Class Cathrine Schmid, United States Army.\"   Each of the retirees is then introduced by a loved one and a heartfelt speech.   \"Mom,\" says Krizek's daughter Ozzie through tears. \"Thank you for serving our country, for leading with heart and spirit and showing me how long hours can still be fun. I love you so much and I'm grateful to be your daughter.\"   Each retiree steps up to speak. Their words are filled with pride and a lot of pain.   \"Best job ever,\" says Krizek. \"And I love submarines, and I love sailors. And I miss it dearly.\"   Fram is introduced next. Before the ban, she was the highest-ranking transgender member of the U.S. armed forces. An astronautical engineer, she deployed to Iraq and Qatar during the Iraq war and later served as an officer in the United States Space Force.   \n   Fram steps up to the microphone.   \"Freedom is not self-sustaining. It is not inevitable. It requires people again and again who are willing to stand up and say: 'If not me, then who?' \"   And then, she asks people to do just that.   \"If you are a trans service member or veteran, I'm going to ask you to do something that may feel uncomfortable. I'm going to ask you to stand for a moment.\"   The crowd rustles as several people stand at attention.   \"Look around this room,\" says Fram. \"These are people who deployed, commanded, innovated, fixed what was broken and made the mission happen.\"   Under the radar   One of those standing is U.S. Army Maj. Kara Corcoran. Her 17 years of service includes significant combat and leadership experience. Commissioned in 2008 as an infantry officer in the Army, she served two tours in Afghanistan and attended Ranger and Airborne schools.   \n   She is still going through her separation from the military. As NPR previously reported, the first Trump administration gave a small window to any transgender person already serving who wanted to stay in the military: get an official medical diagnosis for gender dysphoria within a few months.   \"It was at a very inopportune time because my ex-wife was eight months pregnant with our twin daughters,\" Corcoran says. \"So I quickly rushed into the troop medical clinic.\"   She got her diagnosis in time to keep her job.   After Trump was reelected to his 2nd term, new guidance was put out that listed gender dysphoria as a disqualifying standard for service.   Having obtained the diagnosis as instructed, Corcoran was now identified for removal.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Folded U.S. flags rest on a table at a retirement ceremony for transgender service members in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Laura Hatcher/Human Rights Campaign\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Laura Hatcher/Human Rights Campaign\n    \n\n   \n   In a memo filed February 2025, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave the following rationale for the reversal:   \"The department must ensure it is building 'one force' without subgroups defined by anything other than ability or mission adherence. Efforts to split our troops along lines of identity weaken our force and make us vulnerable. Such efforts must not be tolerated or accommodated.\"   \"It's systematic oppression,\" says Corcoran. \"You're creating unnecessary paperwork for commanders and service members to navigate when it should be the same standard of care in the same process as anybody you would have with a shoulder surgery or a knee surgery.\"   \"By the way,\" Corcoran adds. \"For all the surgeries we get, the recovery period is less. And we're back into the fight – which again stymies their argument.\"   \"W,\" a trans woman serving in the Navy, agrees.   \"Say you were born with bad eyesight and you could get Lasik surgery to fix your eyes,\" she says. \"But there are people spinning a rhetoric that you would be inferior or you would never truly have 20/20 vision because you got surgery and weren't born with it.\"   \n   W has asked to only go by an initial because she's \"stealth\" -- meaning, she's not out as trans and knows she'll lose her job if it's made public.   \"I present very masc because I have a very deep voice,\" she says. \"I am male at birth. So it'd be very difficult for me to use any pronouns besides him, since I am pre-transition.\"   She says only about four of her colleagues know. And those people are helping by asking questions on her behalf so no one suspects anything.   \"I will say there is a lot of quiet support for transgender sailors, at least at my command. Like people are trying their best to follow the letter of the law or the exact wording of these orders without completely outing their trans sailors.\"   That experience is echoed by a fellow sailor. \"A\" is a trans man who is also stealth and using an initial for the same reasons as W. But A is stealth in a different way.   \"It's two very different experiences,\" says A. \"You've got people like me who transitioned prior to the military. So there was no change in documents when I joined.\"   Though unlike W, he says it's definitely documented somewhere in his paperwork. But there's been a similar collective effort from colleagues to keep it quiet since he joined. When he started boot camp, he pulled a sergeant aside to let her know. And she arranged for separate showers for \"religious reasons.\" Later, when an opportunity came up for flight school, it was obvious that A's gender identity would be revealed during the drug testing process. So he and his command decided he would opt out of the training to avoid that situation — but on paper, it was due to his ADHD diagnosis.   He's incredibly grateful for the protection. But also points out that it's stopping him from being more useful to the Navy.   \n   \"I'm completely qualified to serve. I'm good at my job. The Navy has paid for me to be good at this. If we really are preparing for deployment or combat, why can't we just focus on doing our jobs and doing them to the best of our abilities?\"   A focus on gender identity   The scrutiny is spreading to other service populations. In January, NPR's Tom Bowman obtained a memo from the Pentagon announcing a six-month review of women in ground combat jobs, to ensure what it calls the military \"effectiveness\" of having several thousand female soldiers and Marines in infantry, armor and artillery.   Before becoming secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth openly opposed women in ground combat units.   \"I'm straight up saying we should not have women in combat roles,\" he said in a November 2024 podcast hosted by Shawn Ryan. \"It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated.\" But he backtracked during his confirmation hearing last year, saying women can serve in combat roles if they meet male standards.   He repeated this requirement during a September speech at Quantico. Hegseth used the moment to announce the renaming of the Department of Defense as the Department of War, decried \"fat generals\" and declared that the \"woke\" military was gone.   \n   \"This administration has done a great deal, from Day 1, to remove the social justice, politically correct and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department, to rip out the politics,\" Hegseth said from the stage. \"No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses.\"   Hundreds of generals and admirals were ordered from commands all around the world to fly in and attend the speech in person. And a few weeks later, Hegseth released a memo requiring all troops to watch or read it in its entirety.   \n   \"My chain of command was pretty outspoken. Saying, like, why are we wasting our time with this?\" says A.   A pre-determined outcome   Priya Rashid is a military attorney working with several transgender service members, including some interviewed for this story but cannot speak directly about their cases. She's had a front row seat to the Pentagon's push to remove this service population since Trump's second term began. NPR spoke to Rashid in September when she was helping several clients fight the separation process in the Air Force, which she says gave them no due process and was trying to retroactively recoup the promised retirement benefits. Now, that process has spread to the rest of the branches of the armed forces.   When asked for comment, the Pentagon referred NPR to the gender dysphoria policy on its website.   In the latest directives, military separation boards have been ordered to find unfit and separate any transgender servicemember with a current or past documentation of gender dysphoria. Rashid says this is a unique process for several reasons. The first:   \"We know that the outcome is generally predetermined,\" says Rashid, pointing out that this is the first time a specific finding has been mandatory in military separation boards, which are supposed to be independent. \"The government has really set itself up to purge these people out of our ranks.\"   The second unique feature of this process, says Rashid, is that trans servicemembers are not allowed to amend or update any part of their medical records with a doctor's appointment, unlike the rest of the service. Meaning, if a condition no longer affects someone's ability to return to work, that can be updated on their paperwork. Corcoran, the Army major, for example, qualified to have gender dysphoria removed from her record because transitioning was the prescribed treatment for it.   \n   \"That is common. That is something that is afforded to all soldiers. Whether it is a broken knee, a displaced hip, even things like depression and other types of mental health conditions,\" says Rashid. \"But the government is choosing to not allow those with gender dysphoria to engage in their medical access rights.\"   Rashid is also angry about the administration's argument that trans service members are burdening the Pentagon with outsized medical costs. She points to the cost of removing them in comparison.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n        \n                Trans service members were prohibited from wearing their uniforms during their retirement ceremony in Washington, D.C. These were on display on a table at the ceremony.\n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n   \n   \"So when I go to these board members who are the jury, I said, we have spent $22,000 to assemble us all here to discuss somebody's genitals. Is that what we all wanted to do? Every single one of us, myself included, has combat patches. We've all done our time. And yet we're being brought forth not to talk about birth sex. And that just says something about where we're putting our money and the cost incurred upon us. These boards are extremely expensive.\"   And then there's the mental and emotional cost. Rashid gets choked up when she discusses the toll this is taking on her clients and their loved ones.   \"There have been several suicides in the last year,\" she says. \"And we believe that they are directly related to the administrative separation plan that these people, the only thing that they had had in their life and known was a military culture and a military life and that was being ripped away from them.\"   She pauses to compose herself. She says as a lawyer, she has always believed in the law. And that she had more hope in it at this point last year. But her optimism is waning.   \"We always say, you know, just the arc of justice is long. And you know, it'll come back and things will get corrected and fixed. But there are things that cannot be fixed.\"   \n   If not me, then who?    Back at the ceremony, the retirees are being handed their folded flags and doing their final walk-outs.   McChrystal says the separations are a mistake and are affecting mission readiness -- one of the very values that Hegseth claims as a priority for his Department of War, amid several simmering global conflicts.   \"God forbid, if we had a major war and we need to start calling everybody up,\" says McChrystal. \"I would hope that we would not suddenly say we are only going to draft people of a certain type because we wouldn't have enough.\"   Fram thanks McChrystal, salutes him and walks through the crowd in silence, holding her flag to her chest.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Col.

I am sure we saved lives that day.\"   Fram says while she knows McChrystal isn't alone in his sentiments, he seems to be one of the few with the courage to speak up right now.   \"We have so long been ingrained that you don't say anything,\" she says. \"It's a core piece of our identity as members of the military. But there are barriers and norms that we have crossed, that we have been broken. We need those voices to help change our direction.\"   And with that, Fram announced a run for Congress.\n",

The extended rant came in the wake of the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard members who were deployed to patrol Washington, D.C. under Trump's orders, one of whom died shortly before the president spoke to U.S. troops by video on Thursday evening.   A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War is facing charges for the shooting. The suspect emigrated as part of a program to resettle those who has helped American troops after U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.   \n   \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. \"Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won't be here for long!\"   Trump's threat to stop immigration would be a serious blow to a nation that has long defined itself as welcoming immigrants.   Elected on a promise to crack down on illegal migration, Trump's raids and deportations have disrupted communities across the U.S. as construction sites and schools have been targets. The prospect of more deportations could be economically dangerous as America's foreign-born workers account for nearly 31 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   The president said on Truth Social that \"most\" foreign-born U.S. residents \"are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels\" as he blamed them for crime across the country that is predominantly committed by U.S. citizens.   The perception that immigration breeds crime \"continues to falter under the weight of the evidence,\" according to a review of academic literature last year in the Annual Review of Criminology.   \"With few exceptions, studies conducted at both the aggregate and individual levels demonstrate that high concentrations of immigrants are not associated with increased levels of crime and delinquency across neighborhoods and cities in the United States,\" it said.   \n   A study by economists initially released in 2023 found immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. Immigrants have been imprisoned at lower rates for 150 years, the study found, adding to past research undermining Trump's claims.   But Trump seemed to have little interest in a policy debate in his unusually lengthy social media post, which the White House, on its own rapid response social media account, called \"one of the most important messages ever released by President Trump.\"   Trump claimed immigrants from Somalia are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota\" as he used a dated slur for intellectually disabled people to demean that state's governor, Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year, calling him \"seriously retarded.\"   Trump has ramped up his rhetoric since the shooting. On Wednesday night, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who had entered under the Biden administration.   \n   On Thursday, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 \"high-risk\" countries \"to the maximum degree possible.\"   Edlow didn't name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns.\n",

On Monday, the Pentagon announced an investigation into Kelly, a retired U.S. Navy fighter pilot, for possible violations of military law for appearing in the video. The video was published as legal questions swirl around the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities.   While the White House has since walked back the president's remarks calling the Senators' video \"seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH,\" Kelly told All Things Considered he thinks President Trump is \"declaring that loyalty to the Constitution is punishable by death.\"   \n   Listen to the full interview by clicking play on the blue box above.\n",

His desire for the big (peace) prize and cementing his legacy as a dealmaker drive his effort.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  President Trump is sending representatives to Moscow and Kyiv to work out a way to end the war in Ukraine. One of his aides is the subject of a new report from Bloomberg. Bloomberg published a transcript of a phone call in which the aide advises a Russian official about how Russia can handle the emotions of Donald Trump. NPR has not confirmed this transcript. And in a moment, we will hear Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia. We begin with the negotiations.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez is here to talk about why Trump continues to push even after all these setbacks. Franco, good morning.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So the original 28-point plan was widely criticized as a wish list by the Russians. Now the administration says it's updated. Where do things stand now?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. The Trump administration has been furiously negotiating with both sides, bouncing between a Russia-friendly version and a more Ukraine-friendly one. And Trump now says there are only a few remaining points of disagreement. He said last night he's dispatching his special envoy, Steve Witkoff - Witkoff is the Trump negotiator who is on that transcript - and maybe son-in-law Jared Kushner to Moscow to meet with President Putin. And then he's sending Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with the Ukrainians.MARTIN: But, you know, Franco, we've been here before. Do we have a sense of whether this is really progress?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, talks are happening and ideas are being exchanged. That's something. I mean, it's more than what was happening a few weeks ago. But are they closer to reaching a deal? I mean, not necessarily. I mean, I was talking with Ivo Daalder, who was the ambassador to NATO in the Obama administration. And he says, basically, last week, you had Russia agreeing to one plan, and now you have Ukraine agreeing to a different plan.IVO DAALDER: The problem is Ukraine and Russia don't agree. So you can come up with any plan that the U.S. and Russia can agree on and any plan that the U.S. and Ukraine can agree on. That's not the same as having a plan that Ukraine and Russia can agree on. And that's their problem.MARTIN: Last week, President Trump seemed to set this take-it-or-leave-it deadline for Thanksgiving, but he did back off that over the weekend. What does that tell you about his motivations?ORDOÑEZ: Well, I mean, it's another example of how driven Trump is to just get to yes in any way possible. Richard Fontaine served in the George W. Bush White House and now runs the Center for a New American Security. And he told me that what matters to Ukraine and Russia doesn't so much matter to Trump.RICHARD FONTAINE: Trump clearly wants a deal. I don't know that the content of the deal matters all that much to him as long as it stops the fighting. That, therefore, gives a lot of leeway to those negotiating what the terms of that deal are. And, of course, for Ukraine and for the Russians and for the Europeans and for many people, the terms are all-important.ORDOÑEZ: Terms are very important, and that's why Russia wants more of the eastern Donbas region for strategic and economic benefits. And it's also why Ukraine wants clear security guarantees from Western partners like the U.S. to ensure that Russia never invades again.MARTIN: You know, people might remember that Trump talks a lot about the conflicts that he says he has ended. He did that yesterday during the Thanksgiving turkey pardons. How much of this is about his quest for the Nobel Peace Prize?ORDOÑEZ: Look, I mean, I think he genuinely cares about the loss of life. It's something he frequently mentions when talking about the war. But I don't think you can discount his desire for recognition. I mean, he talks about the Nobel Peace Prize a lot. His aides talk about it as well. And Daalder and Fontaine both told me that Trump is likely looking at his legacy. And as any president would, I mean, what better way to be seen as the ultimate dealmaker than solving this intractable war?MARTIN: That is White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Franco, thank you.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Michel.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      In Tennessee, a special election for a vacant congressional seat is expected to be more competitive in a district that has been strongly Republican for years.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  After Democrats won elections this month in New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania, the party is now eyeing a race in Tennessee. The special congressional election is for a district that has been solidly Republican for decades, but is now more competitive. Early voting is already underway. So, Marianna Bacallao for member station WPLN in Nashville headed to the polls to check in with voters.MARIANNA BACALLAO, BYLINE: Overlooking U.S. Route 70 and the neighboring Dollar General, the city hall of Pegram, Tennessee, has opened its doors as an early voting site. It's one of many in the state's 7th congressional district, which is holding a special election that concludes on December 2. Here in Cheatham County, President Trump won with 72% of the vote last year.Trump endorsed the Republican congressional candidate Matt Van Epps. Some voters say they cast a ballot for the former state commissioner because...PAM: There's a lot of work to do because a lot of work didn't get done four years ago.MICHAEL: Making sure that President Trump has the support he needs to carry out his agenda.JEFF: I just like the moral values. I like to get away from the issues of transgenderism and homosexuality, and I like somebody that's backing the way Trump's got the country going.BACALLAO: That was Pam, Michael and Jeff. All three refused to give their last names because they wanted to keep their ballot choices private. But not everyone in Cheatham County is happy.BECKY: I don't know how you could say the price of groceries or anything are coming down unless you've not been to the grocery store. Everything's more expensive.BACALLAO: That's Becky, who also wanted to keep her last name private. She says she voted for Democratic congressional candidate Aftyn Behn because she's worried about her daughter who's just graduated college.BECKY: And she has no chance of being able to live on her own. Everything is expensive.BACALLAO: She's not alone. Affordability is top of mind for Nashville voters, along with...ABRAHAM GARCIA ORTEGA: Safety, money, jobs.JASMINE PATTERSON: Housing.ORTEGA: Inflation is outrageous, you know?BACALLAO: That was Abraham Garcia Ortega and Jasmine Patterson. They also cast their vote for Behn, a state lawmaker. She and Van Epps are vying for a seat left open by the retirement of Congressman Mark Green. While Green has held the seat since 2019, his surprise retirement could present an opportunity for Democrats.This month, the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan newsletter, changed the 7th Congressional district's rating from solidly Republican to likely Republican. The state's GOP chair, Scott Golden, says he's focused on turnout at a time when many voters may be traveling or hosting for the holidays.SCOTT GOLDEN: Anytime you have a special election bracketed by the Thanksgiving holiday, you can't afford to take a day off. You know, I think if there's concern, it's just that, you know, people aren't aware that they have the opportunity to vote right now.BACALLAO: Recent Democratic wins across the country may also help build momentum for their candidate, even in a district that's been a Republican stronghold for decades. Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Rachel Campbell says Behn's focus on affordability, like the cost of groceries, could give her an edge.RACHEL CAMPBELL: My belief is that we're winning because we're focused on the real issues that families are facing, not just in Tennessee, but all across the country.BACALLAO: A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that nationwide, nearly 6 in 10 respondents say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices - and no other issue comes close. Trump is unpopular nationwide with an approval rating of 39%. In Tennessee, though, his base is still strong.

He said the birds should be named Chuck and Nancy — after Democratic stalwarts Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi — but \"I would never pardon those people.\"   Trump claimed that last year's turkey pardons, issued by President Joe Biden, were invalid because he used an autopen. \"Where's Hunter?\" he said, suggesting that his predecessor's son could once again face legal jeopardy.   \n   And all of that was before Trump turned his attention to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who has resisted the White House's plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago.   Trump said he had a joke prepared about Pritzker, but \"I refuse to talk about the fact that he's a fat slob. I don't mention it.\"   Scattered laughter rippled through the audience, which sat under cloudy skies and an intermittent drizzle on the Rose Garden patio.   Trump eventually got around to the business at hand, which was pardoning the turkeys Gobble and Waddle. Both were spared the dinner table, but only one got the spotlight.   \"Gobble, I just want to tell you this — very important — you are hereby unconditionally pardoned,\" Trump said. He reached over to run his hand over the feathers, saying, \"Who would want to harm this beautiful bird?\"   Waddle had previously been spotted in the White House briefing room.   \"Waddle, want to give us a gobble?\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asked.   The turkey obliged.   \"Very on message!\" Leavitt said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump pardons national Thanksgiving turkey Gobble during a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, on Tuesday, in Washington.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump used part of his ceremonial remarks to insist that the price of Thanksgiving meals was dropping under his leadership, although his numbers are misleading. Some research indicates that holiday dinners could cost more this year, a reminder of persistent frustration with inflation.   \n   The president plans to fly south to his private Florida resort later Tuesday, a holiday interlude during what has been a turbulent and uncertain chapter of his second term.   Trump is struggling to advance a plan to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine after an earlier version faced swift criticism from European allies and even some Republicans. The U.S. military is also poised to target Venezuela with military strikes, part of an anti-drug operation that could ultimately destabilize the country's leadership.   In Washington, Trump faces the possibility of a splintering Republican coalition ahead of next year's midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. Some members of his party already took the rare step of crossing the president by successfully pushing legislation to force the Justice Department to release more documents about the Jeffrey Epstein case.   \n   Trump faced a setback in court this week when a federal judge tossed cases against James Comey and Letitia James, two targets of the president's retribution campaign.   Comey, a former FBI director whom Trump fired during his first term, was charged with making a false statement and obstructing Congress. James, the New York attorney general who investigated the president between his two terms, was charged with mortgage fraud.   Both pleaded not guilty and said the prosecutions were politically motivated, pointing to Trump's public demands for the Justice Department to punish his enemies.   The judge said the interim U.S. attorney, a former member of Trump's personal legal team, who obtained the indictments was illegally appointed. However, the decision was made without prejudice, so the Justice Department could try again to charge Comey and James.   The White House plans to be open for holiday tours. However, despite the arrival of a Christmas tree via horse-drawn carriage on Monday, the presidential residence will be much different this year.   \n   Trump's decision to demolish the building's East Wing to make room for a new ballroom has turned part of the White House grounds into a construction site.\n",

Trump dismissed any concerns as \"a standard thing.\"   \"Because he's got to sell this to Ukraine. He's got to sell Ukraine to Russia,\" Trump said, aboard Air Force One, on his way to Florida. \"That's what a dealmaker does.\"   The controversy has shined a new spotlight on Witkoff, the president's long-time friend and chief negotiator who has drawn criticism for his lack of experience and go-it-alone style.   \n   The recording is of an October call in the lead up to the release of the original 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine that favored Russia.   Bloomberg reviewed audio of the call and published a transcript. NPR has not independently verified the transcript or call audio.   Trump said Tuesday night he hadn't heard the audio, but also did not have a problem with the characterization of the call.   \"You got to say, 'look, they want this. You've got to convince them with this. You know, that's a very standard form of negotiation,\" he said.   The criticism has been blunt: That Witkoff is not looking for a balanced deal, but carrying water for Russia — a U.S. adversary and the aggressor in a war versus Ukraine, a strategic partner and European ally.   But Trump doesn't seem too concerned. He's sending Witkoff back to Moscow to try to finalize details of the latest plan with Putin.   Trump and Witkoff have a long friendship   Witkoff and the president have been friends for almost 40 years. Trump calls Witkoff \"a special guy\" and \"my pal.\" Their friendship dates back to a chance encounter at a New York Deli at 3 a.m.   Trump had no cash on him. \"I ordered him a ham and swiss,\" Witkoff said, according to a report in Courthouse News about his testimony in Trump's defense during one of Trump's trials last year.   \n   Witkoff said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that he learned the real estate business from Trump.   \"I wanted to be him,\" Witkoff said. \"Everybody wanted to be him. He'd come to 101 Park Avenue, where I was a lawyer. He had this swashbuckling style. I used to see him come in and I used to say, 'God, I want to be him.'\"   Witkoff has described how Trump was there for him when one of his sons died from an opioid overdose in 2011.   \"I have seen his humanity in the quiet moments away from the spotlight in hospital rooms he didn't have to be in — where his presence brought real solace in a dark hour for my family,\" Witkoff said at the Republican National Convention.   During the campaign, Witkoff helped with fundraising. Trump also turned to Witkoff to handle sensitive matters like trying to repair ties with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and presidential primary challenger Nikki Haley.   \"His best friend, Steve Witkoff, came to our house in South Carolina, spoke to me and my husband, and basically wanted a truce between me and Donald Trump,\" Haley said on her podcast. She told Witkoff that Trump had her support.   Picking Witkoff for a role his son-in-law used to fill   Well before assigning him the Ukraine peace deal, Trump picked his old friend as his envoy to the Middle East.   It was the same position that Trump — in his first term — had given to another person whose loyalty was unquestioned: his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.   Kushner, who now runs an investment firm, had also come from the real estate world and handled many tough files for Trump, including Middle East peace, trade talks with Mexico and Canada, immigration reform and parts of the administration's response to the COVID pandemic.   In President Trump's first term, his son-in-law Jared Kushner held the role now filled by Steve Witkoff. Kushner and Witkoff appeared together on Feb. 20 at a Miami conference organized by the non-profit arm of Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund called the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute.   \n   A lot of experts scoffed at Kushner's lack of experience when he started his White House role, and some raised the same questions about Witkoff.   How Witkoff describes his approach to negotiations   The White House has described Witkoff as a trusted friend of the president who left behind a massive business enterprise to serve the country. He doesn't take a salary and pays for his own travel.   Witkoff is certainly no stranger to creating some Russia-related controversy.   Earlier this year, Witkoff raised eyebrows after appearing on Tucker Carlson's podcast and said Putin was \"not a bad guy.\"   In the same interview, Witkoff explained his approach to negotiations. \"There's no doubt I'm always trying to put myself in the shoes of the other person because a good deal has to work fair for everybody,\" he said.   Don Peebles, the real estate entrepreneur, told NPR this spring that he had seen that attitude firsthand during adversarial talks with Witkoff.   \"If I were going to summarize his approach is to find what the other person, other side, wants — and to try to give it to him,\" said Peebles, who fundraised for former President Barack Obama.   Peebles said he thinks Witkoff probably has more high stakes negotiating experience than most diplomats.   He remembers being forced to deal with Witkoff on a big real estate transaction in New York. Peebles considered walking away. He felt like he had a gun to his head, but never by Witkoff.   Witkoff defused the situation, promising not to be disruptive and explained how they would both be better off as partners, Peebles recalled.   \"He took a very adversarial situation from my perspective and not only got the deal done, but we've been friends ever since.\"   War in Ukraine is not the same as a real estate deal   But solving the war in Ukraine is incredibly complex.   \n   Even negotiating giants such as Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and James Baker would have a tough time convincing Putin to lay down his arms, according to Aaron David Miller, who has served as a negotiator and analyst for both Republican and Democratic administrations.   \"Deals are cut when there is urgency,\" said Miller, who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"And urgency is a function of two things: How much pain the parties are under and what are the prospects for gain right now.\"   Miller said that urgency requires a mediator who is prepared \"to use honey and vinegar,\" or incentives and disincentives to produce something that both Putin and Zelensky will be able to rationalize — as well as sell to their own people.   \"I just don't see Putin ready to make the kinds of concessions that would be required to anchor this thing and make it work,\" Miller said.\n",

They recently picked up a second job with Instacart, to help cover their rising costs.    \n   Despite Posey's job as a case manager at a veterans' organization, and his wife's job in child care, they still can't make ends meet. For their Thanksgiving dinner, they got a turkey and some canned goods from a food pantry. They're scraping together the rest of their meal, but Posey said it's put a damper on their holiday spirit.    \n   \"It kind of takes away from the joy,\" he said. \"I don't feel it this year. To be honest, I'm just trying to stay above water.\"   Posey also has seen how much the veterans he works with are struggling. Many saw their federal SNAP food assistance disrupted this month during the government shutdown, and still haven't caught up. The strain is now beginning to show, he said.   \"We're starting to see a lot more people frustrated, a lot more people angry,\" he said. \"You're starting to see an uptick in violence, especially domestic violence, and a lot of substance use, because they're just overwhelmed.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Steve and India Posey say they're not quite feeling the joy of the holidays this year due to rising costs and increased stress they're feeling \"just trying to stay above water.\"\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   In New York City, Queens resident Rosetta Savannah is facing her own challenges. She's one of those who saw their SNAP payments disrupted during the government shutdown and is still waiting for this month's benefits. So far, she's gotten just half of what she normally receives, and she's had extra medical bills.   \n   Her family's Thanksgiving dinner will also be lighter than usual.   \"We're doing mostly chicken, because chicken is cheaper,\" Savannah said. \"I usually bake cakes and pies but I'm not doing that this year.\"    \n   She's also relying on a local food pantry for a small ham and some sides, but she knows there's no guarantee anything will be left.   \"You have to get up super early to at least be maybe the 30th person on line, and then you just wait and see,\" she said.   Savannah is cutting down on gifts this year, too. Her three kids will only get one small present each, instead of the several she usually gives them.   There will also be fewer presents under the tree at Bonnie Green's home in Bethlehem, Penn.    \"I'm significantly cutting out gifts, there's just no way,\" she said. \"I can't afford it.\"   Green, a 60-year-old professional and homeowner, has always considered herself upper-middle class. She loves Black Friday shopping and had planned on buying several new outfits for her kids, and for her first granddaughter's first Christmas. Typically she would also make an elaborate and plentiful holiday feast.   \"I go big,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This year, Bonnie Green is making use of one of her mother's favorite books, which offers ways to celebrate the holidays on a tight budget. Despite the deep cuts she was forced to make after her federal government job was eliminated, Green is determined to keep smiling and focus on the joy, \"even in the midst of austerity.\"\n                \n                    Jacob Schippell\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacob Schippell\n    \n\n   \n   But earlier this year, her job with the National Science Foundation was one of the many eliminated by the Department of Government Efficiency, which President Trump created by executive order on his first day in office. She still has her job as a professor at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania, but her total income is now half of what it was.   \"That's a lot of money that is no longer there,\" Green said. \"It's really tough.\"   That has forced big changes this year. Besides nixing gifts, she's not decorating as she usually does, and her holiday menu is far more modest. Her usual seafood chowder will be replaced by chicken soup. And forget the Beef Wellington and pecan pie, she said. Instead, she's \"leaning in\" to dishes she can make with much cheaper ingredients.    \n   The biggest blow: her sister won't be able to make it for Christmas. That's not only because of the higher airfare, but also because she's feeling the pinch and needs to work an extra shift.   \"I have friends who (say) the economy has never been better,\" Green said. \"I don't know what economy they're living in, but it's not mine.\"   Still Green adds, she feels fortunate compared to others, especially the many low-income students at her school.   She said the campus food pantry is doing nearly double its usual volume, and she's heard from students who say they're so financially strapped they may be forced to drop out of school just shy of getting their diploma, which would put their future earning potential at risk.   \n   Green, who has spent her career researching how to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged students, set up a scholarship fund this fall to help students who are as close to graduating as they are to running out of money.    \"It would be a tragedy beyond words,\" she said. \"They will never be able to (have a seat) at the table without a bachelor's degree. They won't even be invited to the table, and they deserve to be there.\"   So far, the foundation has raised enough to keep one student in school through graduation. But there are dozens more who have been deemed eligible for the program. Green is doing what she can to help. Even as she's cut her holiday spending, she's increased her holiday giving to support the foundation.\n",

Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, moved to end the prosecution against the remaining defendants after he assumed the case from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who was disqualified by a court late last year.   \"The criminal conduct alleged in the Atlanta Judicial Circuit's prosecution was conceived in Washington, D.C., not the State of Georgia,\" Skandalakis wrote in his motion to dismiss. \"The federal government is the appropriate venue for this prosecution, not the State of Georgia.\"   \n   The prosecution was the last outstanding criminal case against Trump, after a pair of federal prosecutions — one focused on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and another related to the handling of classified documents — were dropped after Trump returned to the White House earlier this year.   Trump cheered the ruling on social media, writing that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia, as the corrupt Fani Willis Witch Hunt against me, and other Great American Patriots, has been DISMISSED in its entirety.\"   \n   The Fulton County DA's office has not responded to a request for comment.   The historic indictment   In Georgia, a Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, in August 2023 in a sweeping racketeering case alleging a conspiracy to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory in Georgia.   The case was spurred in part by a January 2021 recorded phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he asked him to \"find\" 11,780 votes, one more than the margin of Trump's loss in Georgia.   The Georgia case also focused on an alleged scheme to submit a slate of Trump electors despite Biden's victory, to access sensitive voting machine data and an unsuccessful campaign to pressure state officials to interfere with the election result.   \n   After the grand jury indictment, Trump and his codefendants were booked at the Fulton County Jail — with Trump's mug shot becoming a lasting image of the case. Most defendants, including Trump, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Four accepted plea deals — and those remain binding.   The sprawling case was winding its way to trial when attorneys for one of Trump's codefendants filed a motion to dismiss the case premised on a stunning claim: The district attorney had been engaged in an improper personal relationship with a special prosecutor she hired for the case.   Willis acknowledged the relationship had existed, but asserted it had no bearing on the case.   Judge McAfee ultimately ruled that Willis could continue on if the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigned. But a few months later, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed that ruling, removing Willis and her office from the case. The Georgia Supreme Court later declined to hear an appeal, letting the removal stand.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the Georgia election interference case at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta.\n                \n                    Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Skandalakis, a nonpartisan official who Georgia law charged with appointing a special prosecutor, announced in November that he would take the case himself after he was unable to recruit anyone else to assume the case.   \"It's important that someone makes a decision on this case,\" Skandalakis said in a September interview. \"It's important for the public, frankly for the nation, for the defendants, for all the interested parties.\"   That did not mean his decision would be to proceed with the prosecution. While the state charges were insulated in ways that the charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice were not, Trump's lawyers had argued that the case could not continue until he left office in 2029.   The decision now to drop the charges entirely means the case will not proceed even then.   \"This decision will not be universally popular\"   Skandalakis said in making the decision, he would meticulously review the indictment, the law and the case files, including 101 banker boxes of documents and an 8-terabyte hard drive containing the complete investigative file.   \n   Among the options Skandalakis could have considered included dropping the charges against Trump but continuing the case against some or all of his codefendants, or going back to a grand jury for a superseding or updated indictment. The statute of limitations for most felony charges in Georgia is four years and five years for racketeering charges.   Skandalakis stressed that it would be impractical to continue the prosecution. He did say that charges related to Ruby Freeman, a Georgia election worker who faced threats and harassment after being falsely accused of fraud, could continue — but should be brought in Cobb, not Fulton, County.   While cases against some Trump allies involved in efforts to overturn the election continue in other state courts, the Georgia decision brings to a close one of the most high-profile and wide-reaching prosecutions.   Georgia State University Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis disagrees with Skandalakis' finding that there was not a role for the state justice system in this case.   Kreis said states play a crucial part in accountability in election cases because unlike in federal cases, a president cannot pardon people for state charges.   He also said this decision could weaken deterrents, meaning it will be more up to individuals, like secretaries of state, to step in and stop attempts to interfere with election results, rather than the legal system.   And Kreis said a trial would have been a chance for the public to hear the evidence for themselves.   \"This was really an opportunity for justice and reconciliation and a kind of truth-telling that has been squandered,\" Kreis said.   In his motion, Skandalakis wrote: \"I recognize that, given the deep political divisions in our country, this decision will not be universally popular.\" He said his family received threats after he took over the case.   \"The role of a prosecutor is not to satisfy public opinion or achieve universal approval; such a goal is both unattainable and irrelevant to the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion,\" he continued. \"My assessment of this case has been guided solely by the evidence, the law, and the principles of justice.\"\n",
